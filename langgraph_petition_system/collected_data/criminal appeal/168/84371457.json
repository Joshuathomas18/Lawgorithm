It is contended by him  that  the  High  Court  has\nalso not considered the relevant fact that  telecasting  the  story  by  the\nappellant is not in connection with discharge of  public  functions  of  the\nsecond respondent being a public servant and this aspect of the  matter  has\nnot been dealt with by the High Court thereby, it has rendered the  findings\nas erroneous in law and therefore, the same are liable to be set aside.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">Further, it is contended by him that the High Court has failed to take  into\nconsideration  an  important  aspect  of  the  matter  namely,   the   State\nGovernment while  examining  the  representation  submitted  by  the  second\nrespondent for according previous sanction as required under <a href=\"/doc/1901955/\" id=\"a_15\">Section  199(4)</a>\nof the Cr.P.C. and All India  Services  (Conduct)  Rules  of  1968,  in  his\nfavour  authorising  the  State  Public  Prosecutor  to  initiate   criminal\nproceedings against the appellants does not reflect application of  mind  on\nthe part of the State Government as they have failed to find out whether  or\nnot the comments made  against  the  second  respondent  by  the  individual\nelectronic  and  print  media  have  got  content  which   are   defamatory,\nscandalous or libellous and whether the same warrant  the  State  Government\nto permit such institution of criminal proceedings  against  the  appellants\nunder Chapter  XXI  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_16\">Indian  Penal  Code</a>,  1860.  Therefore,  it  is\ncontended that the above explained reasons would show  lack  of  application\nof mind on the part of the State Government to the  facts  presented  to  it\nand therefore, the impugned sanction order accorded by it in favour  of  the\nsecond respondent to initiate criminal proceedings  against  the  appellants\nunder the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_17\">Cr.P.C</a>. referred to supra is vitiated in law and  is\nliable to be set aside.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">  Further, it is contended by the  learned  senior  counsel  that  the  High\nCourt has also failed to take into consideration another relevant fact  that\nthe criminal complaints instituted  by  respondent  No.  1-State  Government\nagainst the appellants,  is  silent  about  their  role  in  committing  the\nalleged offence of telecasting/publishing comments and  allegations  against\nthe  second  respondent  which  are  allegedly  defamatory,  libellous   and\nscandalous.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"123021184\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1992131\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1833908\" id=\"span_5\">It is also contended on behalf of the appellants that the  High  Court  has\nfailed to appreciate that to arraign the  appellants  as  the  accused,  the\ncomplainant ought to have  made  positive  averments  against  them  in  the\ncomplaints and attributed a specific role to each one of them in  committing\nthe alleged offence, warranting  initiation  of  criminal  proceedings,  the\nsame has not been  done,  therefore,  the  summoning  order  issued  by  the\nMetropolitan Sessions Judge and the complaints filed against the  appellants\nby the State Public Prosecutor are not sustainable in law and are liable  to\nbe quashed. The learned senior counsel in support  of  his  contentions  has\nplaced reliance upon the following judgments of this Court in the  cases  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1833908/\" id=\"a_18\">Gour Chandra Rout &amp; Anr. v.

It is further contended  by  him\nin Criminal Appeal No. 854 of 2012 that it is evident from the notice  dated\n13.8.2007 that the sanction for  the  prosecution  was  sought  against  the\nEditor, News  Reporter  and  Printer  and  Publisher  of  Rajasthan  Patrika\nnewspaper, however, no sanction was sought against the  Appellant  Nos.1,  2\nand 3 in Criminal Appeal No. 854 of  2012  who  are  the  Editor  in  Chief,\nAdvisor and printer and publisher of the said newspaper.  After  perusal  of\nall the documents and material  on  record,  the  State  Government  granted\nsanction only  against  the  Editor  of  Rajasthan  Patrika  Newspaper  (the\nappellant  in  Criminal  Appeal  No.  858  of  2012)  by  its  order   dated\n27.10.2007, after proper application of mind. The application for  grant  of\nsanction against appellant Nos.1-3 who are the Editor in Chief, Advisor  and\nPrinter and Publisher was specifically rejected  by  the  State  Government,\ntherefore, the criminal proceedings initiated against them is not  valid  in\nlaw.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1621718\" id=\"span_7\">It is  further  contended  by  him  that  since  the  respondents  have  not\nchallenged the sanction accorded by the State Government  dated  27.10.2007,\nauthorising the criminal proceedings against the Editor and rejecting  grant\nof sanction order against appellant Nos.1-3 in Crl. Appeal No.854  of  2012,\nthe  same  has  become  final,  therefore,  the  public  prosecutor  has  no\nauthority to file any criminal complaint against the appellants in  Criminal\nAppeal No.854 of 2012 who are the Editor-in-Chief, Advisor and  Printer  and\nPublisher of Rajasthan Patrika. He contended that  what  cannot  be  derived\ndirectly cannot be obtained indirectly by the process of court  proceedings.\nHe further placed reliance on the decision of this  Court  in  the  case  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1621718/\" id=\"a_25\">Jagir Singh v. Ranbir Singh and Anr.</a>[6], contending that in the  absence  of\nsanction to prosecute a named person, the public prosecutor  cannot  file  a\ncomplaint and the Trial Court has no jurisdiction to judicially  review  the\nsanction order and issue summons against those persons  whose  name  do  not\nspecifically appear as accused in the order  of  sanction  accorded  by  the\nState Government.</span> It is further contended that this  aspect  of  the  matter\nhas not at all been considered by the  High  Court  even  though  the  legal\nsubmission was made in this regard before it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">Both the learned counsel on behalf of the appellants  contended  that  there\nmust be valid and cogent material before the State Government for  according\nprevious sanction in favour of  the  second  respondent  permitting  him  to\ninitiate criminal proceedings against the appellants.  It  is  contended  by\nthem that the State Government should have examined the  facts,  allegations\nand names of the accused and then should have reasonably  applied  its  mind\nto conclude whether or not the reputation of  the  second  respondent  while\ndischarging his public function as a  public  servant  was  intended  to  be\nharmed. Only  after  such  reasonable  application  of  mind  by  the  State\nGovernment to the facts placed before it, the sanction can  be  accorded  by\nit in favour of the second respondent to initiate criminal  proceedings  and\nonly then the court of sessions shall take cognizance  of  such  offence  in\nthe criminal proceedings initiated against the appellants.  This  aspect  of\nthe matter has not been considered by the learned Judge of  the  High  Court\nwhile passing the impugned Judgment. Therefore, the  impugned  judgment  and\norder is vitiated in law and liable to be set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">It is further urged by the learned counsel on behalf of the appellants  that\nthe High Court has erroneously held that under the scheme of <a href=\"/doc/27007/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 199</a>  of\nthe Cr.P.C., the previous sanction is required against all such persons  who\nhave allegedly committed the offence and not  necessarily  against  specific\nindividuals in order to prosecute them for the offences committed against  a\nperson in respect of his conduct in the discharge of  his  public  functions\nwho at that time was a  public  servant  employed  in  connection  with  the\naffairs of the Union or State. Therefore, it is contended on behalf  of  the\nappellants in Criminal Appeal No. 858 of 2012 that the criminal  proceedings\ninitiated by the first respondent on behalf of the second respondent  should\nhave been confined to only against those persons  named  in  the  Government\nsanction order for the offences referred to supra.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1620307\" id=\"span_8\">Mr. Aruneshwar Gupta, the learned counsel for the  appellants  in  Criminal\nAppeal  Nos.854  and  858   of   2012   further   contended   that   several\ninvestigations were carried out pursuant to the orders passed by this  Court\nin the Sohrabuddin case and on 12.5.2007, a  report  was  submitted  by  Ms.\nJohri which finds reference in  judgment  of  this  Court  in  the  case  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1620307/\" id=\"a_27\">Rubabbuddin Sheikh v.  State  of  Gujarat  and  Ors.</a>[7].  The  fact  of  the\ninvestigation by the CBI in Sohrabuddin’s case was in public domain  and  if\nthat is published in the print media by the appellant (in Crl. A.  Nos.  854\n&amp; 858 of 2012), the same cannot be made the basis of any  defamation  as  it\nhas referred to the judgment  in  the  aforesaid  case  which  is  a  public\nrecord.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">It is also further contended by him that Rajasthan Patrika is  a  subscriber\nof United News of India (UNI) which is one of the largest News  Agencies  in\nIndia, providing news to several news papers in  India.  The  UNI  published\nand broadcast the news item dated 12.05.2007 and the appellants in  Criminal\nAppeal No.  858 of 2012, being the Editor of Rajasthan Patrika got the  same\ntranslated in Hindi and published it in their news paper which is  allegedly\ndefamatory to the second respondent. It is further  contended  by  him  that\nUnited News of India is the source and  first  broadcaster  of  the  alleged\ndefamatory news to its subscribers including the  newspaper  for  which  the\nappellant is the Editor, who acted and published in bona  fide  the  alleged\noffending news believing it to  be  true  and  correct.  Therefore,  in  the\nabsence of any prosecution of UNI, the appellant cannot  be  prosecuted  for\nthe offence of defamation as the same is covered under the Explanation 3  of\nSection 499 of I.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">It is further contended that freedom of  expression  demands  that  criminal\ndefamation in relation to publication of news items and articles may not  be\ninvoked in all the cases but should be limited to only exceptional cases  to\nredress the immediate harm done to the reputation  of  the  individuals  who\nhave been defamed and shall not be allowed to be used  as  remedy  to  serve\nthe ulterior goal as the same will have a negative and  damaging  effect  on\nthe freedom of expression guaranteed to the press.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">It is further contended by him  that  <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_28\">Section  499</a>  of  I.P.C.  defines  the\noffence of defamation as spoken or written, <a href=\"/doc/1820068/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 501</a>  of  I.P.C.  is  for\ndefamatory printing or engraving of defamatory matter  and  <a href=\"/doc/1495647/\" id=\"a_30\">Section  502</a>  of\nI.P.C. is for sale of printed or engraved substances  containing  defamatory\nmaterial. Therefore, <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 499</a> of I.P.C.  would  cover  the  Editor  while\nSection 501 will cover the Publisher and Printer and <a href=\"/doc/1495647/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 502</a>  of  I.P.C.\ncovers the seller. As the offences mentioned under <a href=\"/doc/1820068/\" id=\"a_33\">Sections 501</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/1495647/\" id=\"a_34\">502</a>  of\nI.P.C. are specifically distinct offences which are  against  the  Publisher\nand the Seller, therefore,  the  previous  sanction  order  was  granted  in\nfavour of the second respondent against the Editor  of  the  Newspapers  and\nrejected against the Printer and Publisher.  Therefore,  in  these  appeals,\nthe appellants cannot be tried for the offences under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 499</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1820068/\" id=\"a_36\">501</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1495647/\" id=\"a_37\">502</a>\nof I.P.C. with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_38\">Section  120-B</a>  of  I.P.C.  as  the  liability  of\ndefamation is only limited to the Editor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"501107\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1813801\" id=\"span_10\">In Criminal Appeal No. 851 of 2012, Mr.  Abhimanue  Shrestha,  the  learned\ncounsel appearing for appellant-Mr. Lateef Mohd.  Khan,  General  Secretary,\nCivil Liberties Monitoring Committee, who has allegedly made  certain  false\nand baseless statements against the second respondent under  the  news  item\n“Rajiv Trivedi-Hyderabad Ka Vanjara” “Fauri  Bharkhast  Karne  Ka  Mutalika”\npublished on 8.5.2007 in Siyasat Urdu Daily, contended  that  the  appellant\nis neither the Publisher nor the Seller of the said Urdu  Daily,  therefore,\none would believe  that  he  made  such  statements  on  the  basis  of  the\ninformation through electronic and print media. It is  therefore,  contended\nthat  in  view  of  the  nature  of  the  allegations  against  the   second\nrespondent, the appellant who  is  the  Secretary  of  the  Civil  Liberties\nMonitoring Committee made the above statements  published  in  Siyasat  Urdu\nDaily to make the public aware of the same. The  alleged  offences  are  not\nattracted against him as the allegations in the complaint do not  constitute\nany of the offences under <a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_39\">Sections 500</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1820068/\" id=\"a_40\">501</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1495647/\" id=\"a_41\">502</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_42\">120-B</a>  of  I.P.C.  The\nlearned counsel questioned the legality and validity  of  previous  sanction\naccorded by the State Government in  favour  of  the  second  respondent  to\nprosecute the appellant in the  said  appeal  by  placing  reliance  on  the\ndecisions of this Court in the cases of <a href=\"/doc/1813801/\" id=\"a_43\">Kartar Singh &amp; Ors. v. The State  of\nPunjab</a>[8] and <a href=\"/doc/501107/\" id=\"a_44\">R. Rajagopal &amp; Anr. v. State of T.N. &amp; Ors.</a>[9]\n\nOn the other hand, Mr. P. Vishwanath  Shetty,  the  learned  senior  counsel\nappearing on behalf of the State has sought to justify  the  sanction  order\nauthorising the Public Prosecutor to institute criminal proceedings  against\nthe appellants herein, the same was accorded after applying its mind to  the\nfacts stated in the representation given by the second respondent  that  the\nstatements telecast and published in the electronic and print media  by  the\nappellants were defamatory and affected his reputation and the same were  in\nconnection with the discharge of his public functions  as  an  IPS  Officer.\nThe State  Government  after  applying  its  mind  was  satisfied  that  the\nreputation of the second respondent was harmed by printing  and  telecasting\nthe defamatory statements by the appellants herein. Therefore,  it  accorded\nthe sanction order under <a href=\"/doc/1901955/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 199(4)</a> of Cr.P.C. in favour of  the  second\nrespondent to initiate criminal proceedings  against  the  appellant,  which\nprovision does not speak of mentioning the names against whom  the  criminal\nprosecution has to be instituted by the State Public Prosecutor.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">He has further contended that the learned Additional  Metropolitan  Sessions\nJudge, after applying his mind with regard to the allegations  made  against\nthe appellants took cognizance of the matter and issued order of summons  to\nthe appellants to appear before the sessions  court  with  their  respective\ncounter to the criminal proceedings initiated against  them.  The  same  was\nstalled by the appellants herein by initiating proceedings before  the  High\nCourt and this Court. It is contended by him that the challenge  before  the\nHigh Court has been rightly rejected after dealing  with  each  one  of  the\nrival legal contentions  urged  in  the  Criminal  Petitions  filed  by  the\nappellants, which do not warrant interference by this Court in  exercise  of\nits appellate jurisdiction, as the  appellants  are  required  to  face  the\ntrial in the proceedings initiated against them by  respondent  No.  1-  the\nState Government.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1780899\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1824113\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"647363\" id=\"span_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"88129\" id=\"span_14\">Mr. Pappu Nageshwar Rao,  the  learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  second\nrespondent, sought to justify the sanction accorded in favour of the  second\nrespondent by drawing our attention to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/295559/\" id=\"a_46\">Sections 132</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1127398/\" id=\"a_47\">188</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/967463/\" id=\"a_48\">196</a>, <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_49\">197</a>, <a href=\"/doc/27007/\" id=\"a_50\">199</a>  of  Cr.P.C.

He\nfurther <a href=\"/doc/1780899/\" id=\"a_57\">placed reliance upon</a> Section  308  proviso  2  and  <a href=\"/doc/1555290/\" id=\"a_58\">Section  473</a>  of\nCr.P.C., regarding the limitation for sanction and <a href=\"/doc/1303805/\" id=\"a_59\">Section  484</a>  of  Cr.P.C.\nregarding sanction saving clause to justify that the  sanction  accorded  by\nthe State Government to prosecute the appellants herein is  perfectly  legal\nand valid. He therefore urged that  in  view  of  the  above,  the  sanction\naccorded by the State Government in favour of second  respondent  cannot  be\nfound fault with by  the  appellants  and  prayed  for  dismissal  of  these\nappeals.</span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">We have heard the  rival  legal  contentions  urged  on  behalf  of  learned\ncounsel for both the parties and answer the same by assigning the  following\nreasons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">     With regard to the contention urged by learned senior counsel Mr.  Guru\nKrishna Kumar on behalf of the appellants in Criminal Appeal No.857 of  2012\nand connected appeals that the High Court has not considered all the  issues\nraised before it in the criminal petitions filed by the  appellants  seeking\nfor quashing of the criminal proceedings initiated against them,  is  wholly\nuntenable in law for the reason that from perusal of the impugned  order  of\nthe High Court, it is clear that the sanction  was  accorded  by  the  State\nGovernment under the relevant Government  order  in  favour  of  the  second\nrespondent. On examining the facts, circumstances and  evidence  on  record,\nthe previous sanction is accorded to launch  necessary  prosecution  against\nthe CNN-IBN channel, Siyasat Urdu Daily: Sri Latif Mohammad Khan,  Rajasthan\nPatrika (Jaipur) Hindi daily, Deccan Chronicle  English  Daily  and  Etemaad\nUrdu Daily. By careful  reading  of  the  provision  under  <a href=\"/doc/27007/\" id=\"a_60\">Section  199</a>  of\nCr.P.C., read  with  the  All  India  Services  (Conduct)  Rules,  1968,  it\nprovides  that  previous  sanction  must  be   accorded,   authorising   the\ninitiation of criminal prosecution against the accused,  however,  the  said\nprovisions do not state that it is necessary to mention the  names  of  each\none of the accused who are alleged to have  committed  the  offence  in  the\nsame alleged transaction. Therefore, in the case on hand, when the  previous\nsanction was accorded  by  the  State  Government  against  those  who  were\nresponsible for the telecast/publication of the news both in electronic  and\nprint  media  which  according  to  the  second   respondent   damaged   his\nreputation, it is not necessary  for  the  State  Government  to  separately\nissue sanction order against each one of the appellants, when they  are  all\nresponsible for telecasting  and  publishing  the  said  news  item  in  the\nelectronic and print media and also when the names of  the  said  electronic\nand print media have already been mentioned  in  the  said  sanction  order.\nTherefore, there is no merit in  the  contention  urged  on  behalf  of  the\nappellants that their names have not  been  specifically  mentioned  in  the\nsaid sanction order. The said contention is untenable in law and  therefore,\nliable to be rejected. The same is accordingly rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1992131\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1845526\" id=\"span_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1833908\" id=\"span_17\">Further, the reliance placed  by  the  learned  counsel  on  behalf  of  the\nappellants upon  the  judgments  of  this  Court  referred  to  supra  while\naccording sanction in favour  of  the  second  respondent  to  initiate  the\ncriminal proceedings against the appellants the  State  Government  has  not\napplied its mind, this contention is also wholly untenable  in  law  as  the\nexercise of power by the State Government under <a href=\"/doc/27007/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 199</a>  of  Cr.P.C.  is\nin the  administrative  and  ministerial  capacity  and  according  of  such\nsanction is as per the subjective satisfaction on  the  part  of  the  State\nGovernment. The learned senior counsel  on  behalf  of  the  appellants  has\n<a href=\"/doc/1780899/\" id=\"a_62\">placed reliance upon</a> the judgments of  this  Court  in  the  cases  of  <a href=\"/doc/1833908/\" id=\"a_63\">Gour\nChandra Rout &amp; Anr. v. The Public Prosecutor</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1845526/\" id=\"a_64\">P.C.  Joshi  &amp;  Anr.  v.  The\nState of Uttar Pradesh</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1992131/\" id=\"a_65\">Mansukhlal Vithaldas Chauhan v. State of  Gujarat</a>\n(all referred to supra). With regard to the above referred cases, the  first\ntwo cases have not dealt with the exercise of power  under  <a href=\"/doc/27007/\" id=\"a_66\">Section  199</a>  of\nCr.P.C., except stating the ministerial  exercise  of  power  by  the  State\nGovernment while exercising its power under <a href=\"/doc/73825649/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 198B (3)(a)</a>  of  Cr.P.C,\n1898. In so far as the third case referred to supra upon which the  reliance\nplaced upon by the learned senior counsel on behalf of the  appellants,  the\nsame is in relation to the previous sanction to be  accorded  by  the  State\nGovernment for the purpose  of  prosecution  under  the  provisions  of  the\n<a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_68\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>. Therefore, none of the above  cases  on  which\nreliance has been placed by the learned counsel on behalf of the  appellants\nhave any relevance to the fact situation on hand.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">Having regard to the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/3026506/\" id=\"a_69\">Protection of  Civil  Rights  Act,  1955</a>,\nthe complainant-second respondent during the relevant point of time was  the\nPolice Officer in the  services  of  the  State  Government  and  he  cannot\nprosecute the appellants in  a  court  of  law  without  obtaining  previous\nsanction from the State  Government  as  contemplated  under  the  aforesaid\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_70\">Cr.P.C</a>. Therefore, in order to prosecute the  appellants,  the\nsecond respondent made a representation to the State Government  along  with\na petition with regard to initiation of  criminal  proceedings  against  the\nappellants under the provisions referred to supra in  respect  of  which  he\nhas sought the sanction of the State  Government.  On  appreciation  of  the\nsame,  the  State  Government  in  exercise  of  its  administrative  powers\nappreciated the facts of the matter, rightly applied its mind  and  accorded\nthe sanction under <a href=\"/doc/1901955/\" id=\"a_71\">Section  199(4)</a>  of  Cr.P.C.  in  favour  of  the  second\nrespondent to initiate criminal proceedings under  the  provisions  referred\nto supra against the appellants. The  said  sanction  was  accorded  by  the\nState Government after appreciating that the  statements  telecast/published\nby the appellants  in  the  electronic  and  print  media  as  well  as  the\nstatement given by the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 853 of 2012  in  the\nUrdu Daily on the basis of which the news is published by its Editor,  which\nare all statements defaming the second respondent while he  was  discharging\nhis public function as  a  public  servant.  Therefore,  the  contention  on\nbehalf of the appellants that there was no application of mind on  the  part\nof the State Government in according the said sanction is  wholly  untenable\nin law, liable to be rejected and the same is accordingly rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">Further, the contention urged by the appellants’  counsel  placing  reliance\nupon the  aforesaid  judgements  that  the  act  of  the  second  respondent\nallegedly  aiding  the  Gujarat  Police  Officers   to   facilitate   taking\nSohrabuddin from Bidar to Ahmedabad, has nothing to do  with  the  discharge\nof his public  functions,  hence,  the  said  statement  in  the  news  item\nallegedly defaming the second respondent being  telecast  and  published  in\nelectronic and print media do not attract <a href=\"/doc/27007/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 199</a> of Cr.P.C.  Therefore,\nit is contended on behalf of the appellants that the  sanction  accorded  by\nthe State Government is beyond its jurisdiction as the said  act  of  aiding\nthe Gujarat Police is an independent act and it is not in  relation  to  the\ndischarge of public functions of the second respondent though  he,  at  that\nrelevant  point  of  time,  was  discharging  his  public  functions.   This\ncontention on behalf of the appellants is also wholly untenable in law,  for\nthe reason that determining the  question  on  whether  or  not  the  second\nrespondent while aiding the Gujarat Police at that point of time was in  the\ncapacity of his official discharge of his public functions or otherwise,  is\nto be determined by regular trial after examining the  facts,  circumstances\nand evidence on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1620307\" id=\"span_18\">The reliance placed  upon  the  judgment  of  this  Court  in  the  case  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1620307/\" id=\"a_73\">Rubabbuddin Sheikh</a> (supra), contending that the fact  of  the  investigation\nby the CBI in Sohrabuddin’s case was the subject matter  before  this  Court\nat para 2 of the judgment in the  case  referred  to  supra,  therefore,  by\npublishing the same in the newspaper by the appellants (in Crl. A. Nos.  854\n&amp; 858 of 2012) cannot be made the basis of any defamation as the  said  news\nitem was published after referring to the  aforesaid  judgment  which  is  a\npublic record. This contention urged on behalf of the appellants  is  wholly\nuntenable in law for the reason that at para 2 of <a href=\"/doc/1620307/\" id=\"a_74\">the said judgment</a> of  this\nCourt in the above referred case is only with regard to the  facts  of  that\ncase, whereas, the allegations made against the appellants  herein  are  for\npublishing  and  telecasting  defamatory  statements  against   the   second\nrespondent, which question of  fact  has  to  be  examined,  considered  and\nanswered only after regular trial proceedings before the learned  Additional\nMetropolitan Sessions Judge. Therefore, the above contention urged  in  this\nregard is wholly untenable and the same is rejected.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"123021184\" id=\"span_19\">Further, the learned counsel in Criminal Appeal Nos. 854 and  858  of  2012<a href=\"/doc/1620307/\" id=\"a_75\">,\n<a href=\"/doc/1620307/\" id=\"a_76\">placed reliance upon</a></a> the judgment of this Court in the case of  <a href=\"/doc/123021184/\" id=\"a_77\">Urmila  Devi</a>\n(supra), in support of the proposition of law that only the  Editor-In-Chief\nis responsible for the telecast or publication  of  the  alleged  defamatory\nstatements against whom the sanction order is accorded and that there is  no\nsanction order accorded to initiate  prosecution  against  others.</span>  Further,\nthe contention on behalf of the  appellants  that  there  must  be  specific\nmention of persons in the sanction order against  whom  prosecution  can  be\nlaunched and in the absence of the same, a single  sanction  order  accorded\nby the State Government against all the other appellants  in  the  connected\nappeals amounts to giving a wider  interpretation  of  the  provision  under\nSection 199(4) of  Cr.P.C.,  which  is  not  the  object  of  the  aforesaid\nprovision under the Cr.P.C. This aspect of the matter has not been  examined\nby the High Court; therefore, impugned order  is  vitiated  in  law  and  is\ncontrary to the provisions of Section 199(4) of the Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">By careful reading of <a href=\"/doc/1901955/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 199(4)</a> of the Cr.P.C., it  does  not  indicate\nthat in order to initiate criminal  proceedings  against  the  accused,  the\npublic servant needs  to  obtain  sanction  from  the  State  Government  in\nrespect of each one of the persons against  whom  the  same  transaction  of\noffence is alleged  and  the  names  of  the  accused  are  required  to  be\nmentioned  specifically  in  the  sanction  order  accorded  by  the   State\nGovernment.  It is sufficient if one sanction is accorded to  prosecute  all\nthe concerned persons involved in that occurrence, thus, the  contention  on\nbehalf of the appellants in this regard is also liable to  be  rejected  and\nis accordingly rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">The contention urged by  the  learned  counsel  Mr.  Abhimanue  Shrestha  on\nbehalf of  the  appellants  in  Criminal  Appeal  No.851  of  2012  is  also\nuntenable in law for the reasons  stated  that  the  appellant  has  made  a\nstatement on the basis of the news items  telecast/published  in  electronic\nand print media. The same cannot be accepted by us for the  reason  that  it\nis a matter that has to be examined by the trial court after  recording  the\nfindings of fact on the basis of valid and cogent evidence to be adduced  by\nthe State Public Prosecutor on behalf of the  respondent.  Therefore,  there\nis no substance in the said contention urged on  behalf  of  the  appellants\nand the same is rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_22\">The learned counsel appearing on behalf of  the  second  respondent  rightly\nsought to justify the  findings  and  reasons  of  the  High  Court  in  its\nimpugned judgment, placing reliance on <a href=\"/doc/295559/\" id=\"a_79\">Sections 132</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1127398/\" id=\"a_80\">188</a>, <a href=\"/doc/967463/\" id=\"a_81\">196</a>, <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_82\">197</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/27007/\" id=\"a_83\">199</a>\nof Cr.P.C., inter alia contending that for prosecution of an accused in  the\ncase of defamation of a public servant, sanction can be accorded  under  the\nold <a href=\"/doc/73825649/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 198B(3b)</a> of Cr.P.C.,1898, by any Secretary or  authorisation  by\nthe Government. He has also <a href=\"/doc/123021184/\" id=\"a_85\">placed  reliance  upon</a>  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_86\">Section  2U</a>  of  Cr.P.C.\nwhich defines a Public Prosecutor as any person appointed under  Section  24\nand included any person acting under the directions of a Public  Prosecutor.\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1780899\" id=\"span_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1824113\" id=\"span_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"647363\" id=\"span_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"88129\" id=\"span_23\">The  learned  counsel  on  behalf  of  the  second  respondent  has  rightly\njustified that the sanction accorded by the State  Government  to  prosecute\nthe appellants is perfectly legal and valid by placing reliance  on  Section\n308 proviso 2, <a href=\"/doc/1555290/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 473</a> of Cr.P.C. regarding the limitation for  sanction\nand <a href=\"/doc/1303805/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 484</a> of Cr.P.C. The  learned  counsel  has  also  rightly  <a href=\"/doc/123021184/\" id=\"a_89\">placed\nreliance upon</a> the judgments in the cases of <a href=\"/doc/88129/\" id=\"a_90\">Master Girdhari Lal,  Printer  &amp;\nPublisher  of  Naya  Bharat  v.  The  State</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/647363/\" id=\"a_91\">Pachhalloor  Noohu  v.  Public\nProsecutor</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1824113/\" id=\"a_92\">Sant Lal v. Krishan Lal</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1780899/\" id=\"a_93\">B.  Basavalingappa  and  Anr.  v.\nNarasimhan</a> all referred to supra. Therefore, the submission made by  him  is\nwell founded and the same must be accepted.</span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">Further, the learned counsel for  the  appellants  by  placing  reliance  on\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_94\">Articles 19</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_95\">21</a>  of  the  Constitution  of  India  contended  that  the\ninitiation and continuance of the criminal proceedings in the present  cases\nhinder and hamper the very freedom of  press  which  is  most  precious  and\nconstitute an affront to the aforesaid provisions under the Constitution  of\nIndia. The said contention has been rightly rebutted by the learned  counsel\non behalf of the respondents by strongly urging that the  reputation  of  an\nindividual is also equally important and that the said aspect of the  matter\nmust be considered after adducing cogent and valid  evidence  on  record  by\nthe Public  Prosecutor  before  the  learned  trial  Judge  who  shall  then\nappreciate the same and record his findings on merits of the case.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">In view of the aforesaid reasons, we are of the opinion  that  the  impugned\njudgment passed by the  High  Court  of  Andhra  Pradesh  in  rejecting  the\npetitions for quashing the initiation of criminal  proceedings  against  the\nappellants under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. is perfectly  legal  and  valid,\nthe same does not call for interference by this Court  in  exercise  of  its\nappellate jurisdiction as there is no substantial question of law framed  in\nthe appeals nor is there any miscarriage of justice for  the  appellants  to\ninterfere with at this stage. In our considered view, having regard  to  the\nnature  of  the  complaint,  the  respondents  are  required  to  prove  the\nallegations against the appellants by adducing valid  and  cogent  evidence,\nthe same has to be considered by the trial court and accordingly record  the\nfindings on the merits of the  case.   The  appeals  are  devoid  of  merit,\nliable to be dismissed and are accordingly dismissed.  The  orders  granting\nstay of further proceedings before the trial court shall stand vacated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                               ………………………………………………………J.\n                                         [V.
