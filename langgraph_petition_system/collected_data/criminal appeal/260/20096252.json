Having      appreciated     the    evidence     on    record,       the\n\nlearned    ASJ,    has    held   the     accused-appellant        guilty     of\n\ncommitting rape and murder of the deceased and throwing\n\nher dead body into the well to conceal the evidence of the\n\nmurder and rape. Upon the aforesaid findings, he convicted\n\nand sentenced the accused-appellant as stated in para-2 of\n\nthis judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">8.     We heard arguments advanced by the learned counsel\n\nfor the parties at length.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">9.        The learned     Government       Advocate     submitted          that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                  (10)</span>\n                                                Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                                Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\nalthough    the   prosecution    case   rests    entirely     upon      the\n\ncircumstantial evidence, yet the prosecution has proved all\n\nthe circumstances beyond reasonable doubts and they are of\n\nconclusive nature and none of them is capable of being\n\nexplained in favour of the accused-appellant. He further\n\nsubmitted     that   the   cumulative    effects     of    the     proved\n\ncircumstances are that they form a complete chain which\n\npoints unerringly that none other than the accused-appellant\n\nhimself has committed the crime. Thus, the learned ASJ has\n\nrightly convicted the accused-appellant. On the sentence\n\npart, he submitted that the accused-appellant raped and\n\nmurdered the deceased aged near-about five years, at a time\n\nwhen he was given a responsibility by her Tau Brajbhan (PW-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">4) to drop her at the school, reposing faith in his bonafides.\n\nHowever, he betrayed the faith. He further submitted that as\n\nper the evidence on record, the accused-appellant has got a\n\ndaughter whose age is almost same as that of the deceased.\n\nAs such, he had a filial duty towards the deceased, but he\n\nmade her a tool of satisfying her sexual lust. Hence, he is\n\nworse than a beast in the garb of human body. Under the\n\ncircumstances, the learned ASJ has rightly awarded him\n\ncapital    punishment.     He,    therefore,       prayed        for    the\n\nconfirmation of the death sentence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">10.       Per contra, the learned counsel for the accused-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                               (11)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">                                          Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                          Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\nappellant submitted that he does not contradict the fact that\n\non the fateful day, Brajbhan (PW-4) took the deceased from\n\nvillage Itma to Maihar in the vehicle of the accused-appellant.\n\nHaving referred to the depositions of Sampat (PW-1), Arun\n\nVerma (PW-2) and Ramji Kacher (PW-3), he argued that\n\nBrajbhan (PW-4) has not taken any active part in the search\n\nof the deceased when she had not returned to her home.\n\nThus, his conduct is quite unnatural. In the cross-examination\n\nof Sampat (PW-1), it is challenged on behalf of the accused-\n\nappellant that he has a property dispute with his elder\n\nbrother Brajbhan (PW-4). Hence, the real culprit of the crime\n\nis Brajbhan (PW-4), who committed her murder due to said\n\ndispute. However, the accused-appellant is made an accused\n\nof the case just on the ground that on the fateful day i.e.\n\n23.02.2015 the deceased travelled in his vehicle from her\n\nnative village Itma to Maihar. He further submitted that the\n\nconduct of Pramod Singh (PW-15) in seizing the school bag\n\nand the dead body of the deceased is     also unusual because\n\nhe had first gone to the place wherefrom he recovered the\n\nschool bag and thereafter he went to the well for the\n\nrecovery of the deceased&#x27;s dead body. In the normal course,\n\nhe ought to have first recovered the dead body of the\n\ndeceased and thereafter the school bag. He further submitted\n\nthat in the disclosure statement Ex. P/6 it is mentioned that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                     (12)</span>\n                                                  Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                                  Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\non the deceased&#x27;s dead body there is only an underwear,\n\nwhereas the photographs of Articles A-4 to A-6, show that\n\nwhen the deceased&#x27;s dead body was took out from the well,\n\nshe was in her full school uniform.          Arun Verma (PW-2) and\n\nRamji Kacher (PW-3) are the witnesses of the disclosure\n\nstatement Ex. P/6 and the recovery memos Ex. P/8 and Ex.\n\nP/9.   As   per   their    depositions,    they   are   the    deceased&#x27;s\n\nmaternal uncle and Pupha (the husband of her father&#x27;s sister)\n\nrespectively. Hence, they are interested witnesses. Thus,\n\ntheir evidence is not reliable on the points that the accused-\n\nappellant had made the disclosure statement and that at his\n\ninstance the school bag and the dead body of the deceased\n\nwere    recovered.         He    further    submitted       that      during\n\ninvestigation the school bag was not got identified by the\n\ndeceased&#x27;s parents and her relatives in accordance with law.\n\nHence, there is no evidence on record that the school bag\n\nbelongs to the deceased. He further submitted that the\n\nInvestigating Officer Pramod Singh (PW-15) arrested the\n\naccused-appellant         vide   arrest    memo   Ex.P/11       after     the\n\nrecovery of deceased&#x27;s dead body and the school bag. Hence,\n\nthe disclosure statement Ex. P/6 and the recovery memos Ex.\n\nP/7 and P/8 are inadmissible in evidence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">11.     The learned counsel for the accused-appellant further\n\nsubmitted that as per the FSL reports Exs. P/25 and P/26, no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                (13)</span>\n                                             Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                             Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\nhuman spermatozoa were found on the deceased&#x27;s clothes\n\nand her vaginal swab. Hence, the offence of rape is not\n\nproved. He further submitted that Brajbhan (PW-4) himself\n\nentrusted the custody of the deceased to the accused-\n\nappellant to drop her at the school. Hence, the offence of\n\nkidnapping is also not made out. He also submitted that the\n\nlearned A.S.J., has sentenced the accused-appellant under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_22\">Sections 376 (A)</a> of the IPC and 5 (1) (m) r/w 6 of the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_23\">POCSO\n\nAct</a>, which is against the provisions of amended <a href=\"/doc/174867083/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 42</a> of\n\nthe   POCSO   Act.   Thus,   the      impugned   judgment       suffers\n\naforesaid legal infirmities. He concluded his submissions\n\nasserting that the impugned judgment is based upon mis-\n\nappreciation and misreading. Hence, it is liable to be set-\n\naside and the accused-appellant deserves to be acquitted of\n\nall the charges.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">12.    Alternatively, the learned counsel for the accused-\n\nappellant submitted that in case this Court upholds the\n\nconviction of the accused-appellant, then this case does not\n\nfall in the category of &quot;the rarest of the rare case&quot;. Hence,\n\nthe capital sentence awarded to him under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_25\">Sections 376 (A)</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_26\">302</a> of the IPC deserves to be altered in the sentence for\n\nlife imprisonment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">13.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31143592\" id=\"span_12\">In view of the law laid down by the Supreme Court in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                       (14)</span>\n                                                            Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                                            Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\n<a href=\"/doc/31143592/\" id=\"a_27\">Mohinder Singh Vs.

Now, we shall proceed to scrutinize the evidence on\n\nthe circumstances of Para-14 upon which the prosecution\n\ncase is based.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">31.      Sampat (PW-1), father of the deceased, has stated in\n\nhis evidence that the deceased used to go to school by\n\nschool bus from his native village Itma. On 23.02.2015 she\n\nmissed the school bus. Thereupon, he asked his brother\n\nBrajbhan (PW-4) to take her to the school. At about 10.00\n\na.m., Brajbhan (PW-4) took her in the vehicle of the accused-\n\nappellant. In para-9 of his cross, he has given evidence in\n\ndetail as to how he knows the accused-appellant prior to the\n\ncrime. In para-11, he has stated that Brajbhan (PW-4) does a\n\njob of electrician at one electric shop by the name of Agrasen\n\nElectricals, Maihar. In view of the aforesaid evidence, it\n\nappears to us that it is quite a natural on his part to ask his\n\nbrother Brajbhan (PW-4) to take the deceased to the school.\n\nMoreover, it is not challenged by the defence that on the\n\nfateful day Brajbhan (PW-4) and the deceased travelled in the\n\naccused-appellant&#x27;s vehicle from village Itma to Maihar. Thus,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                  (22)</span>\n                                                 Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                                 Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\nwe hold that aforesaid evidence of Sampat (PW-1) is fully\n\nreliable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">32.         Brajbhan (PW-4) and Ramkumar (PW-6) have also\n\ncorroborated the evidence given by Sampat (PW-1). There is\n\nnothing adverse in their cross-examinations to disbelieve\n\ntheir evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">33.         Having examined the evidence of Sampat (PW-1),\n\nBrajbhan (PW-4) and Rajkumar (PW-6), we hold that the\n\nprosecution      has   conclusively     proved    circumstance         no.1\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt that on the fateful day at about\n\n10.00 a.m. Brajbhan (PW-4) and the deceased left their\n\nnative village Itma for Maihar in a vehicle being driven by the\n\naccused-appellant himself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">34.         Brajbhan (PW-4) has stated in his evidence that when\n\nthe vehicle reached the turn of Katni road in Maihar, he told\n\nthe accused-appellant to drop them at the school. Thereupon,\n\nhe told him that at first he would unload the vegetables from\n\nhis vehicle at Sabzi Mandi, Maihar. He also told him that he\n\nhad to go to the school to deposit his daughter&#x27;s fee.\n\nTherefore, he would drop her there. Believing upon his\n\ncommitment, he got off the vehicle and left the deceased into\n\nhis custody.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_67\">35.         The learned counsel for the accused-appellant has\n\nchallenged the credibility of Brajbhan&#x27;s (PW-4) statement on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                  (23)</span>\n                                                   Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                                   Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\nthe grounds, first; he and the deceased in fact got off the\n\nvehicle at Maihar, secondly; there are property disputes\n\nbetween him and his brother Sampat (PW-1) and thirdly; he\n\nhad not played any active role in search of the deceased\n\nwhen she had not come back to her native village after the\n\nschool was closed for a day.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">36.      We will examine Brajbhan&#x27;s (PW-4) evidence in the\n\nlight of aforestated contentions. In para 8 of his cross, he\n\nhas strongly denied that he and the deceased both had\n\nalighted from the vehicle at Sabzi Mandi. Ramji Shukla\n\n(PW-5)   has   stated   in   para-2     of   his   statement        that    on\n\n23.02.2015 he saw the deceased in the vehicle of the\n\naccused-appellant near the gate of Sabzi Mandi, Maihar.\n\nNothing adverse has come out in his cross-examination.\n\nTherefore, his evidence is trustworthy. Thus, the defence&#x27;s\n\ncontention is not true much less proved that Brajbhan (PW-4)\n\nand the deceased got off the vehicle at Sabzi Mandi, Maihar.\n\nIn para-12 of his cross, Sampat (PW-1) has emphatically\n\ndenied that there are property disputes between him and his\n\nbrother Brajbhan   (PW-4) on account of which their relations\n\nare strained. Upon the perusal of entire depositions of\n\nSampat (PW-1) and Brajbhan (PW-4), we find that both are\n\nsemi-literate and they earn their livelihood by doing manual\n\njobs. Moreover, there is no evidence either documentary or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                 (24)</span>\n                                              Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                              Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\noral on record on the point that they have                  substantial\n\nparental properties on account of which there is a bitterness\n\nin their relations over the property disputes. If, there exists a\n\nproperty related dispute between them, Sampat (PW-1) would\n\nhave never asked Brajbhan (PW-4) to take the deceased to\n\nher school. Thus, we completely rule out the possibility that\n\nBrajbhan (PW-4) himself murdered the deceased on account\n\nof property-dispute. Brajbhan (PW-4) has stated in para-3 of\n\nhis statement that in the evening of the fateful day when the\n\ndeceased had not reached her home, then he with others\n\nwent to the school to ascertain whether the deceased had\n\nattended the school? His         statement is corroborated by\n\nSampat&#x27;s   (PW-1)    evidence    appearing        in    para-9   of    his\n\ndeposition. Brajbhan (PW-4) has also stated in para-3 of his\n\ndeposition that when they came to know that the deceased\n\nhad not reached her school, he and other persons searched\n\nher. In view of the above, it cannot be said that Brajbhan\n\n(PW-4) had not taken active part in the search of the\n\ndeceased. Hence, there is no evidence on record to draw a\n\nconclusion that his conduct was unusual on account of which\n\nthe needle of suspicion moves onto him. On the basis of the\n\naforesaid analysis of evidence. We hold that credibility of the\n\nevidence   of   Brajbhan   (PW-4)      is   not        eroded    on   the\n\naforementioned grounds.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                 (25)</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_70\">                                              Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                              Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">37.       Having drawn our attention in paras 5 and 6 of the\n\nstatement of Brajbhan (PW-4), the learned counsel for the\n\naccused-appellant    has    argued     that   there    are     material\n\ndiscrepancies and the omissions between his deposition and\n\nhis case dairy statement Ex. D/3. Upon the perusal, we hold\n\nthe discrepancies and omissions are minor in nature which do\n\nnot impinge upon the trustworthiness of his evidence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">38.       On the basis of above close scrutiny of the evidence,\n\nwe hold that the prosecution has proved circumstance no.2\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt that on the fateful day Brajbhan\n\n(PW-4) had left the deceased in the custody of accused-\n\nappellant upon his assurance that he would drop her at the\n\nschool.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">39.       Ramji Shukla     (PW-5) has testified that he is a\n\nresident of village Itma. He knows the accused-appellant and\n\nthe deceased since long. He is an artisan by occupation. On\n\n23.2.2015, he came to Maihar in search of a job. On that day,\n\nat Sabazi Mandi Gate, Maihar around 9:30 a.m. he saw the\n\naccused-appellant sitting at the driving seat in his vehicle and\n\nby his side the deceased in her school uniform. This witness\n\nhas stated in his cross-examination that on 26.02.2015 the\n\npolice recorded his case diary statement, Ex.D/4, whereas his\n\ncase diary statement was, in fact, recorded on 28.2.2015. In\n\nour view, this contradiction is not material and it has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                 (26)</span>\n                                           Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                           Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\ncertainly cropped up on account of lapse of memory. We also\n\nfind some omissions appearing in his evidence and his case\n\ndiary statement, Ex.D/4. On due consideration, we find that\n\nthe omissions are not material. Moreover, learned counsel for\n\nthe accused-appellant has not pointed out anything in his\n\ncross-examination which render his deposition unreliable and\n\nuntrustworthy. Hence, we hold that his evidence is fully\n\nreliable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">40.         Ram Kumar Kushwaha (PW-6) has stated in his\n\nevidence that he is a resident of village Itma. He knows very\n\nwell the accused-appellant and the deceased. He has Pan Ki\n\nDukan (betel-shop) at Tamatar Mandi, Itma. On 23.2.2015, at\n\nabout 11:00 a.m., sitting in his shop he saw the deceased\n\nwith the accused-appellant in his vehicle going towards Katni\n\nroad.   At that time, the accused-appellant was driving the\n\nvehicle on high speed. This witness was subjected to lengthy\n\ncross-examination but there is nothing adverse in his cross-\n\nexamination to draw an inference that he is prejudiced\n\nagainst the accused-appellant. Therefore, we hold that his\n\nevidence is trustworthy and reliable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_75\">41.         On the basis of the aforesaid testimonies of Ramji\n\nShukla (PW-5) and Ram Kumar Kushwaha (PW-6), we hold\n\nthat on the fateful day the deceased was with the accused-\n\nappellant after Brajbhan (PW-4) had left her in his custody.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                              (27)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_76\">                                         Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                         Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">42.    Prahlad Patel (PW-8) is the Manager and Teacher of\n\nthe School. On the basis of the attendance register, Ex.P/15,\n\nfor the month of February 2015, he has stated that on\n\n23.2.2015 the deceased has not attended the classes. There\n\nis nothing contrary in his cross-examination to discredit his\n\nevidence.

In Dharam Deo Yadav Vs. State of U.P. (2014 (5) SCC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">509), the Supreme Court in para 19 of the decision has held\n\nthat if the prosecution on the basis of reliable evidence\n\nestablishes that the missing person was seen in the company\n\nof the accused and was never seen thereafter, it is obligatory\n\non the part of the accused to explains the circumstances in\n\nwhich the missing person and the accused parted company.\n\nHence, in the instant case, the accused-appellant has to\n\nexplain where he parted company with the deceased. We find\n\nthat the accused-appellant has not offered any       explanation\n\neither through the cross-examination of material prosecution\n\nwitnesses or in his examination under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 313</a> of the\n\nCr.P.C. as to the place where he had left the deceased on the\n\nfateful day.

On the basis of the aforesaid analysis of evidence, we\n\nhold that the prosecution has proved the circumstance no.3\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt that the deceased was with the\n\naccused-appellant all the time before she was murdered.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_81\">45.

He reduced all\n\nthe information furnished by him into writing in his own\n\nlanguage in the disclosure statement, Ex.P/6.

They saw a shoe\n\nfloating in the well. With the help of persons gathered there,\n\nhe got the dead body of the deceased extricated from the\n\nbed of the well.

The upshot is that\n\nthe   disclosure   statement   and    the    recovery      memos        are\n\ninadmissible in evidence. Therefore, the learned ASJ has\n\ncommitted an error in law by placing reliance upon them. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"508403\" id=\"span_40\">In\n\n<a href=\"/doc/508403/\" id=\"a_47\">Manohar and another Vs.

An accused is\n\ndeemed to be in police custody when he gives information\n\nand gets the recoveries made to the Investigating Officer. In\n\nview of the said ratio, we hold that the disclosure statement\n\nand recovery memos are admissible in evidence.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_83\">47.        The learned counsel for the accused-appellant has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                    (30)</span>\n                                                 Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                                 Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\nassailed the truthfulness of Pramod Singh&#x27;s testimony on the\n\nground that he has falsely recorded the disclosure statement\n\nand the recovery memos in the name of the accused-\n\nappellant. In this regard, he has pointed out the following\n\nfacts: first, his conduct is unusual because he first recovered\n\nthe school bag and thereafter the deceased&#x27;s dead body,\n\nwhereas the normal conduct of him would have been opposite\n\ni.e., first, the recovery of the dead body of the deceased and\n\nlater the recovery of school bag. Secondly, as per the\n\ndisclosure statement, there is only an underwear on the\n\nperson of the deceased, whereas her photographs, Articles\n\nA/5 and A/6, show that when her dead body was recovered\n\nfrom the well, she was found in her full school uniform and\n\nthirdly   witnesses     to   the   disclosure    statement       and     the\n\nrecovery memos are Arun Verma (PW-2) and Ramji Kacher\n\n(PW-3) who are the close-relatives of the deceased. Hence,\n\nthey are interested witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"820169\" id=\"span_42\">48.       Now,   we      proceed     to   consider      the      aforesaid\n\nsubmissions.     Upon    the   perusal    of    cross-examination          of\n\nPramod Singh (PW-15), we find that he was not cross-\n\nexamined on the point why he had given preference to\n\nrecovery of the school bag over the recovery of the dead\n\nbody of deceased. To our mind, if he had been cross-\n\nexamined on the aforesaid point, he would have certainly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                      (31)</span>\n                                                   Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                                   Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\nexplained the reasons on account of which he preferred the\n\nrecovery of school bag first. Under the circumstance, we do\n\nnot find his conduct unusual. True is that in the disclosure\n\nstatement, it is mentioned that there is only an underwear on\n\nthe person of the deceased, whereas her photographs Articles\n\nA/5 and A/6 show that her dead body was recovered in her\n\nfull school uniform. To our opinion, the said discrepancy is\n\nnot material. It is true that the witnesses of the disclosure\n\nstatement and the recovery memos are close relatives of the\n\ndeceased. The Supreme Court has observed in para 9 of its\n\ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/820169/\" id=\"a_49\">State of A. P. Vs. S. Rayappa</a> (2006 (4) SCC 512)\n\nthat it has now almost become a fashion that the public is\n\nreluctant to appear and depose before the court especially in\n\ncriminal cases because of varied reasons. Criminal cases are\n\nkept dragging for years to come and the witnesses are\n\nharassed a lot. They are being threatened, intimidated and at\n\nthe   top   of   all,   they   are     subjected    to    lengthy      cross-\n\nexaminations. In such a situation, the only natural witnesses\n\navailable to the prosecution would be the relative witnesses.\n\nA relative witness is not necessarily an interested witness. On\n\nthe other hand, being in close relation to the deceased he\n\nwill try to prosecute the real culprit by stating the truth.\n\nThere is no reason as to why a close relative will implicate\n\nand depose falsely against somebody and screen the real\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                    (32)</span>\n                                               Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                               Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\nculprit to escape him unpunished. The only requirement is\n\nthat the testimony of a relative witness should be examined\n\ncautiously.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"113626962\" id=\"span_45\">The same view is taken by the Supreme Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/113626962/\" id=\"a_50\">Sahabuddin Vs. State of Assam</a> (2012 (13) SCC 213). On the\n\nbasis of the aforesaid ratio, the bonafides of Pramod Singh\n\n(PW-15) cannot be doubted on this count. In the light of the\n\ndiscussion, we reject the aforesaid submissions made by the\n\nlearned counsel for the accused-appellant.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">49.     From the perusal of the evidence appearing in the\n\ncross-examination of Pramod Singh (PW-15), we find that\n\nthere is no evidence to the effect that he acted against the\n\naccused-appellant in a prejudice manner. Hence, we hold that\n\nhis evidence is credible and trustworthy.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">50.     Arun Verma (PW-2) and Ramji Kacher (PW-3) have\n\ncorroborated in material particulars the evidence given by\n\nPramod Singh (PW-15). Both are subjected to grueling cross-\n\nexaminations on behalf of the accused-appellant. But there is\n\nno conflicting and contradictory evidence in their cross-\n\nexaminations to disbelieve their testimonies or to draw a\n\nconclusion   that   they    have    given   evidence     having      been\n\nprejudiced   against       the   accused-appellant.       Thus,      their\n\nevidence strengthens Pramod Singh&#x27;s statement.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_87\">51.     Ravi Shankar (PW-14) who is a witness of Lash\n\nBaramadgi Panchnama Ex.P/7, has deposed that on 25.2.2015\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                              (33)</span>\n                                          Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                          Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\nhe was posted as a Constable at Police Station Maihar. On\n\nthat day at around 10:00 to 11:00 a.m.,    the     SHO of Police\n\nStation Maihar instructed him on cello phone to go a well\n\nnear the water canal of village Paraswara with ropes and\n\nhooks. Thereupon, he reached the said place taking with him\n\nthe aforesaid articles. He and some of the persons present\n\nthere made an attempt to fish the dead body out by means of\n\nropes and hooks but in vain. Thereupon, he and Devendra,\n\nwho is also a witness of Lash Baramadgi Panchnama but was\n\nnot examined by the prosecution, climbed-down in the well\n\nand found a dead body lying on the bed of the well. They tied\n\nthe dead body with ropes and hooks. Thereafter, the dead\n\nbody of the deceased was      pulled out from the well. This\n\nwitness was crossed in brief by the defence. We find no\n\ninconsistencies in his evidence as a whole. On the other\n\nhand, photographs marked as Articles A/3 and A/4, support\n\nthe veracity of his statement. On the basis of the evidence of\n\nthis witness, we hold that since the dead body of deceased\n\nwas recovered from the bed of the well, it was exclusively in\n\nthe knowledge of the accused-appellant the place where the\n\ndeceased&#x27;s dead body was lying.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">52.     We find that the recovered school bag was not put to\n\nthe test identification proceedings. However, the defence has\n\nnot challenged in the cross-examination of Promod Singh\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                   (34)</span>\n                                              Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                              Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\n(PW-15), Arun Kumar (PW-2) and Ramji Kacher (PW-3) that\n\nthe bag is not of the deceased. Hence, their testimonies\n\nremain unchallenged. We, therefore, hold that the recovered\n\nschool bag belongs to the deceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">53.          Upon the aforesaid analysis of the evidence, we hold\n\nthat the prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt\n\ncircumstance no.4 that the dead body of the deceased and\n\nher school bag were recovered pursuant to the disclosure\n\nstatement of the accused-appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">54.

He has proved post-mortem examination report,\n\nEx.P/18, and identified the signatures of the panel doctors\n\nthereon. He has also stated that Dr. (Smt.) S. B. Awadhiya\n\nhas given opinion as to the sexual assault. In paras 12 of the\n\ncross,   he     has    emphatically       denied   that    the    deceased\n\nsustained injuries on her neck due to a fall or rubbing her\n\nneck against a bushy plant.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                               (36)</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\">                                          Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                          Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_97\">55.    Nothing has been pointed out by the learned counsel\n\nfor the accused-appellant which may lead us to discard his\n\ntestimony. Moreover, the positive diatom-test report Ex.P/29\n\nconfirms his opinion that the cause of death of deceased was\n\nante-mortem drowning.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_98\">56.    Dr. (Smt.) S.B. Awadhiya (PW-11) fully corroborates\n\nthe testimony of Dr. Pradeep Nigam (PW-10). She has added\n\nher opinion in the post-mortem examination report, Ex.P/15,\n\nthat the presence of injuries on her genitalia prove that the\n\ndeceased was subjected to sexual assault. Replying to a\n\nquery raised by the learned trial Judge, she has stated that\n\nthe deceased suffered injuries on her private parts on\n\naccount of forceful insertion of penis. In cross, she has\n\nexplained in detail the reasons of finding fresh blood in the\n\nlabia majora. Notwithstanding that, her dead body was lying\n\nin water for long hours. According to her, the orifice of labia\n\nmajora of the deceased was very narrow, on account of\n\nwhich water could not reach inside it. It is apposite to\n\nmention here that the photograph of Article A-10 is a close-\n\nup of the deceased&#x27;s genitalia showing the           presence of\n\nfresh blood on her labia majora. Thus, the photograph\n\nconfirms the aforesaid opinion given by her. Moreover, there\n\nis nothing in her cross to reject her aforesaid opinion.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">57.     However, the learned counsel for the appellant has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                    (37)</span>\n                                                   Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                                   Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\nchallenged the opinion of Dr.(Smt.) S. B. Awadhiya on the\n\nbasis of FSL reports, Exs.P/25 and P/26. According to the\n\nreports, no human spermatozoa were found on the deceased\n\nclothes and in her vaginal swab. Since the deceased dead\n\nbody was lying in deep water for long hours, on the basis of\n\nwhich we may say with certitude that the semen would have\n\ndissolved in water as being soluble. Hence, the FSL reports\n\nare negative. Under the circumstances, the negative reports\n\nof the F.S.L. do not debunk the opinion given by Dr.(Smt.)\n\nS. B.

Upon his medico-legal examination, he found that\n\nthe   accused-appellant     is    capable     of     performing        sexual\n\nintercourse. In this regard, he has given M.L.C. report,\n\nEx.P/13. There is one line cross-examination of this witness\n\nwhereunder he has admitted that he had not found any\n\ninjury on the accused-appellant male-genitalia. Thus, we\n\nhold that the accused-appellant was capable of committing\n\nsexual intercourse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">59.     In   the   light   of    close    scrutiny    of   the     aforesaid\n\nevidence, we hold that the prosecution has proved beyond\n\nreasonable doubt circumstance no. (5) that the accused-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                   (38)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_102\">                                                Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                                Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\nappellant had sexually assaulted and murdered the deceased\n\nby throttling.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_103\">60.     Now, we consider defence evidence. The accused-\n\nappellant has examined in his defence his father Sajjan\n\nPrasad (DW-1). He has testified in his evidence that the\n\naccused-appellant was taken into custody by the police on\n\n23.2.2015. However, he has not given any cogent evidence in\n\nthis regard to prove his version. The prosecution has also\n\nchallenged       his   version   in   his   cross-examination.         The\n\nprosecution has produced Rojnamcha entries Ex.P/27 to\n\nEx.P/28 in the evidence of Pramod Singh (PW-15), the\n\nInvestigating Officer, upon the perusal of Ex.P/27, it is\n\nmanifest that the accused-appellant was taken into custody\n\non 25.02.15. In his cross, the correctness of entries is not\n\nchallenged even remotely. There is no evidence on record to\n\ndoubt the correctness of Rojnamcha entry Ex.P/27. Hence,\n\nhis bald statement cannot be relied on. Even if it is presumed\n\nthat the police had taken the accused-appellant into custody\n\non 23.02.2015 after the recording of the FIR, despite that his\n\nevidence has no evidentiary value because he is totally silent\n\non the point what he wants to prove by saying that the\n\naccused-appellant was taken into custody on 23.02.15 in\n\nplace of 25.02.2015. Thus, we hold that the evidence of this\n\ndefence witness has no relevancy at all.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                  (39)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_104\">                                             Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                             Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_105\">61.     Considering the cumulative effect of all the proved\n\ncircumstances, we hold that the chain of circumstantial\n\nevidence is complete, which unerringly points that none other\n\nthan   the   accused-appellant      had   committed      the     crime.\n\nTherefore, the learned ASJ has rightly held the accused-\n\nappellant guilty for committing rape upon the deceased and\n\nmurder of her and for causing the disappearance of evidence\n\nof her rape and murder by throwing her dead body into the\n\nwell. However, the learned ASJ has committed an error in\n\nholding the accused-appellant guilty of kidnapping of the\n\ndeceased on the ground that Brajbhan (PW-4) himself had\n\nentrusted the custody of the deceased to the accused-\n\nappellant getting an assurance from him that he would drop\n\nher off at the school. Hence, offence of kidnapping as defined\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/1515807/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 361</a> of the IPC is not made out.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_106\">62.     Now, we shall deal with the facet of sentence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_107\">63.     We have already held that the learned ASJ has\n\ncommitted an error of law in convicting the accused-appellant\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 363</a> of the IPC.

In the light of the aforesaid legal positions, we shall\n\nconsider whether the instant case falls within the category of\n\n&quot;rarest of the rare case&quot;? We have noticed the following\n\naggravating and the mitigating circumstances in the present\n\ncase:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">                     Aggravating Circumstances\n\n         (1)     At the time of commission of the crime, the age of the\ndeceased was five years and over three months. Thus, we can say that\nshe was raped and murdered at the age when girls often play with their\ndolls and when they are unaware about the materialistic world.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">         (2)     As per the record, at the time of commission of offence,\nthe age of accused-appellant was near-about 33 years. Thus, he was\nmatured enough to know the consequences of committing the ghastly\ncrime.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">         (3)         The age difference between the deceased-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_153\">prosecutrix and the accused-appellant is near-about 28 years.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                    (48)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_154\">                                                   Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                                   Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\nThus, it is not a case of physical intimacy between them\nwhich had provoked the accused-appellant to commit the\ncrime.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_155\">          (4)       As per the record, the accused-appellant has\ngot a daughter whose age is almost similar to that of the\ndeceased and they were the school-mates. Hence, he ought\nto have bestowed upon him love and affection as his bestows\nupon own         daughter   but he        made   her    a    scapegoat      for\nsatisfying his sexual lust. Thus, he is a beast in the clothe of\nhuman body. Hence, he does not deserves any kind of\nsympathy and looking to the nature of crime even a common\nman      would    expect    from   the     court   to       award   him     no\npunishment other than the death penalty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_156\">       (5)          He committed the crime when Brajbhan (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_157\">4) left the deceased into his custody with a high hope that he\nwould drop her at the school but he betrayed his belief by\ncommitting the crime.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">       (6)          We have come across through the news\nmedia many cases of rape where the rapists first committed\nrape and thereafter murdered the victims with the sole\ncriminal intention that they would not lodge the police\nreports against them. The present case falls in this category.\nIn the circumstances, we are of the view that a strong\nmessage ought to go to criminals of like minded that in such\ncases the Courts would award only death penalty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_159\">                   Mitigating Circumstances\n      (1) The prosecution has not produced any criminal record\nof the accused-appellant at the trial. Hence, the logical\ninference may be that the accused-appellant is first offender.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_160\">         Upon the comparison of aggravating and the mitigating\ncircumstances, we find that the aggravating circumstances\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                               (49)</span>\n                                          Criminal Reference No.05/2015\n                                          Criminal Appeal No. 2303/2015\n\noutweigh the mitigating circumstances.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_161\">77.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1312651\" id=\"span_72\">In <a href=\"/doc/1312651/\" id=\"a_76\">Santosh Kumar Satishbhushan Bariyar Vs.
