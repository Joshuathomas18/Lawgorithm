Before the incident in question, the hapless woman\n\n(deceased in the present case) had complained that she was\n\nraped by accused-respondent Purnendu Kumar Patra on\n\n28.04.1997.   She complained the matter to Panchayat, and\n\nwhen no action was taken, on 26.09.1997 she lodged a First\n\nInformation Report against the aforesaid accused person, and\n\na case in respect of offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 376</a> IPC\n\nwas registered against him.

The neighbours, who\n\nrushed to the spot, stated to have taken the victim first to the\n\npolice station and thereafter took the deceased to Sub\n\nDivisional Hospital, Contai, where she was admitted for the\n\ntreatment. No written complaint appears to have been given to\n\nthe police at that point of time. At the time of her admission in\n\nthe hospital, she said to have disclosed to the attending doctor\n\nPW-6 B. Debroy the names of the two accused, namely\n\nPurnendu Kumar Patra and Rabin Jana as the two persons\n\nwho came to her house.       It appears that no one from the\n\nhospital bothered to inform to the police about the incident.\n\nSince there was no relative of hers in the hospital, on\n\n31.10.1998 she requested PW-7 Joyram Jana (who used to\n\nlive nearby Contai Sub Divisional Hospital and happened to\n\nhave come to the hospital to see some other patient), to write\n\nher complaint and send the same to the police by registered\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                       Page 4 of 36</span>\n\n\n\npost.

The trial court after hearing the parties\n\nfound both the accused guilty of charge of offence punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 302</a> IPC and after hearing on sentence,\n\naccused-respondent Purnendu Kumar Patra was sentenced to\n\ndeath by directing him to be hanged by neck until his death\n\nsubject to confirmation by the High Court of Calcutta, and\n\nco-accused    Rabin     Jana   was    sentenced   to     rigorous\n\nimprisonment for life and directed to pay fine of Rs.25,000/-,\n\nin default to suffer further rigorous imprisonment for a period\n\nof five years. Reference was made by the trial court to the High\n\nCourt for confirmation of death sentence. Both the convicts\n\npreferred criminal appeal against the order passed by the trial\n\ncourt.   The High Court disposed of the Reference and the\n\nappeal filed by the convicts by a common order, impugned\n\nbefore us, by which the Death Reference was rejected and the\n\naccused were acquitted.

The High Court has acquitted the accused with the\n\nfollowing observations: -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">     “…….It is claimed on behalf of the prosecution that\n     there was strong motive behind the murder of\n     Saraswati Guchait. Since she filed a case alleging\n     commission of rape on her by the appellant namely\n     Purnendu Kumar Patra, the appellants were biding\n     for an opportune moment to get rid of the principal\n     witness. In this connection it may be mentioned\n     that the other appellant Rabin Jana was cited just\n     as a witness in that case. There was apparently no\n     reason whatsoever for the witness to pour acid on\n     Saraswati Guchait. The house in question wedged\n     between the several houses. Her husband and sons\n     were also inside her house at the time of the alleged\n     incident. It is doubtful as to whether she was\n     actually called at late hours in the night. It is\n     equally doubtful as to whether she opened the door\n     on receiving the call of a person who was alleged to\n     have committed rape on her earlier. The story\n     presented through P.W.1, P.W. 2, P.W. 3 and P.W. 5\n     is not believable. The statement of the principal\n     witness are not consistent. Too much importance\n     should not have been placed on the contradictory\n     statements of the witnesses.        Indifferent and\n     nonchalance on part of the near relations,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                                  Page 11 of 36</span>\n\n\n\n      neighbours police officers and the doctors were not\n      properly taken note of. Effort was made to entangle\n      the appellants long after the alleged incident. No\n      enquiry was conducted for ascertaining the reasons\n      for her sustaining injury. The statement of the\n      injured was not recorded either. There should not\n      have been conviction and sentence on such\n      unsatisfactory materials before the court. Added to\n      it, were the defects in framing charges and\n      examination of the appellants under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_15\">section 313</a> of\n      the Code of Criminal Procedure. The conviction and\n      sentence is thus found not sustainable.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">10.   On behalf of the appellant Suresh Chandra Jana, brother\n\nof the deceased, Shri S.K. Bhattacharya, Advocate, submitted\n\nbefore us that it is a case of total apathy coupled with the\n\nerroneous appreciation of evidence by the High Court resulting\n\nin acquittal of perpetrators of heinous crime of which a\n\nhapless poor lady, who had earlier been raped, made to die by\n\nthrowing acid on her.      It is further submitted that the\n\naccused-respondent Purnendu Kumar Patra, who had political\n\npatronage, has been allowed by the High Court to get\n\nemboldened with little regard for human dignity and honour.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">It is argued that a fault finding approach adopted by the High\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                                    Page 12 of 36</span>\n\n\n\nCourt is against the principles of doing justice to the victim.\n\nThe statements of witnesses were read over before us.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">11.

On the other hand, Shri Rana Mukherjee, learned senior\n\ncounsel appearing on behalf of the accused-respondents,\n\ncontended that where two views are possible and the courts\n\nbelow have taken different views, the view favouring the\n\naccused should be accepted. He further pointed out that in\n\nthe present case the First Information Report is delayed by\n\ntwenty three days, and no dying declaration was got recorded\n\nthough the victim died after twenty six days of the incident, as\n\nsuch the High Court did not err in rejecting the Death\n\nReference made by the trial court, and rightly acquitted the\n\naccused.   It is also pointed out before us that even the\n\nenvelope in which the complaint said to have been sent by\n\npost to the police, was not placed on record by the\n\nInvestigating Officer.   It is submitted on behalf of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">\f                                                      Page 13 of 36</span>\n\n\n\naccused-respondents that the time given in the charge framed\n\nwas different than what is alleged by the prosecution.

Lastly,\n\nit is argued that accused-respondent Rabin Jana had no\n\nmotive to commit the murder of the deceased.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">13.   Having heard the submissions of learned counsel for the\n\nparties and going through the record of the case, we are of the\n\nview that the present case is an example of complete\n\ninsensitiveness on the part of the police, the doctors and the\n\nsystem towards the victim. The High Court appears to have\n\nadopted   a   casual   approach   in   appreciating    the   facts,\n\ncircumstances and evidence of the case, particularly, in a case\n\nwhere the trial court has awarded capital punishment in a\n\nsensitive matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">14.   The High Court has allowed itself to be swayed by the\n\nfact that the First Information Report in the present case is\n\ndelayed by twenty three days but it has failed to appreciate the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                                 Page 14 of 36</span>\n\n\n\nfact that the helpless woman, who was admitted by the\n\nneighbours in the hospital, had moron husband and two little\n\nkids at home, and none of them were able to go to police\n\nstation and get the First Information Report recorded.\n\nObservations of the trial court while examining PW-4 Niranjan\n\nGucchait that he is incapable to understand questions and\n\nanswers, and he could not be examined, has been completely\n\nignored by the High Court. It has come on the record in the\n\nevidence of PW-2 Sudha Krishna Jana as to how when\n\nneighbours rushed, he took the victim to the Hospital and got\n\nher admitted there.    The record clearly shows that the\n\ndeceased, in pathetic condition, has taken help of PW-7\n\nJoyram Jana, who had come in the hospital to see his patient,\n\nand she requested him to right down her complaint and send\n\nit to police by registered post.   The said witness (PW-7)\n\nappears to have done only this much favour to the victim that\n\nhe wrote down her complaint, got her L.T.I put on the\n\ncomplaint and sent it by ordinary post to the police, which\n\nadmittedly was received by the police only on 07.11.1998.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                                    Page 15 of 36</span>\n\n\n\nPW-2 Sudha Krishna Jana, the neighbour, has further\n\ndisclosed that when the victim cried – “Moregalam” (I am\n\ndying) and she told that the accused had thrown acid on her,\n\nhe took the victim to the hospital. He has further stated that\n\non way to hospital, the victim was first taken to Contai Police\n\nStation but the police advised him to take the victim to Contai\n\nSub Divisional Hospital. It appears from the record that after\n\nthe victim was admitted in the hospital, neighbours did not\n\nbother to see her. In the circumstances, we find that the delay\n\nin lodging the First Information Report is fully explained on\n\nthe record and is fatal for the prosecution case.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">15.   No doubt, it has come in the statement of PW-7 Joyram\n\nJana, the scribe of the report, and that of PW-11 Inspector\n\nAlok Kumar Ghosh, who received the written complaint by\n\npost and endorsed it to PW-9 Sub Inspector Dibakar\n\nBhattacharjee to investigate, that the envelope in which the\n\ncomplaint was received was not on the record.            PW-11\n\nInspector Alok Kumar Ghosh has further stated that the\n\nenvelope got misplaced. In our opinion, merely for said lapse\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\f                                                            Page 16 of 36</span>\n\n\n\nof not producing the envelope on the part of the investigating\n\nagency is not sufficient in the present case to create\n\nreasonable doubt in the prosecution story. In our opinion, it\n\nis almost impossible to come across a single case where the\n\ninvestigation was completely flawless or absolutely foolproof.\n\nThe function of the criminal court is to find out the truth and\n\nit is not the correct approach to simply pick up the minor\n\nlapses of the investigation and acquit the accused, particularly\n\nwhen the ring of truth is undisturbed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">16.    It may be mentioned that it is not every doubt but only a\n\nreasonable doubt of which benefit can be given to the accused.\n\nA     doubt   of   a   timid   mind   which   is   afraid    of   logical\n\nconsequences, cannot be said to be reasonable doubt.                The\n\nexperienced, able and astute defence lawyers do raise doubts\n\nand uncertainties in respect of evidence adduced against the\n\naccused by marshalling the evidence, but what is to be borne\n\nin mind is - whether testimony of the witnesses before the\n\ncourt is natural, truthful in substance or not. The accused is\n\nentitled to get benefit of only reasonable doubt, i.e. the doubt\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                                                    Page 17 of 36</span>\n\n\n\nwhich rational thinking man would reasonably, honestly and\n\nconscientiously entertain and not the doubt of a vacillating\n\nmind that has no moral courage and prefers to take shelter\n\nitself in a vain and idle scepticism.    The administration of\n\njustice has to protect the society and it cannot ignore the\n\nvictim altogether who has died and cannot cry before it. If the\n\nbenefits of all kinds of doubts raised on behalf of the accused\n\nare accepted, it will result in deflecting the course of justice.\n\nThe cherished principles of golden thread of proof of\n\nreasonable doubt which runs through web of our law should\n\nnot be stretched morbidly to embrace every hunch, hesitancy\n\nand degree of doubt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">17.   Death of the victim on account of burn injuries suffered\n\nby her due to acid attack gets corroborated not only from the\n\nstatement of PW-6 Dr. B. Debroy, who attended her in the\n\nhospital, but also from the statement of PW-8 Dr. Tapas\n\nKumar Chatterjee, who conducted post mortem examination\n\non 23.11.1998 and opined that the deceased had died of shock\n\nand sepsis. He has further mentioned in his report (Exh. 5)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                                    Page 18 of 36</span>\n\n\n\nabout the ante mortem chemical burn injuries on the body of\n\nthe deceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">18.   As far as not recording of dying declaration is concerned,\n\nthe High Court has failed to appreciate the fact that PW-9 Sub\n\nInspector Dibakar Bhattacharjee has specifically stated that\n\nhe did make an attempt to record the dying declaration of the\n\nvictim, but the Medical Officer of Contai Sub Divisional\n\nHospital advised him that there was no need to record the\n\ndying declaration as the patient was recovering. This fact gets\n\ncorroboration from the statement of PW-6 Dr. B. Debroy who\n\nhas admitted that he opined that there was no need of dying\n\ndeclaration recorded as the patient was responding well to the\n\ntreatment. The said fact is on the record in Exh. 3. In the\n\ncircumstances of the case, the statement of the victim, given\n\nby her in the First Information Report (Exh. 4) scribed by\n\nPW-7 Joyram Jana, should have been treated as her dying\n\ndeclaration.    PW-7 Joyram Jana has proved the left thumb\n\nimpression put by the victim on the complaint before it was\n\nsent to the police by post.      This witness has underwent\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">\f                                                          Page 19 of 36</span>\n\n\n\ncross-examination and nothing has come out which creates\n\ndoubts in his testimony. The victim has specifically mentioned\n\nin    her   report   about   the   motive   on   the   part    of   the\n\naccused-respondent       Purnendu     Kumar      Patra,    who      had\n\nallegedly raped her and case with G.R. No. 756 of 1997 was\n\npending.     The prosecution story given in the F.I.R also gets\n\ncorroboration from the statement of PW-1 Dipak Kumar\n\nGuchhait, nephew of the victim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">19.    The victim has further stated in her complaint, which can\n\nbe treated as dying declaration, that she did go to the police\n\nstation after she was injured with acid hurled at her and\n\npolice instructed that she be taken to the hospital where she\n\nwas admitted in bed No. 33 (female ward). However, in her\n\ncomplaint Exh.4, the deceased has not given any specific role\n\nto accused-respondent Rabin Jana, nor any motive appears to\n\nbe on his part to take life of the victim. He was said to be a\n\nmember of the Panchayat and the Panchayat had taken no\n\naction against Purnendu Kumar Patra in connection with the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                                   Page 20 of 36</span>\n\n\n\nearlier incident of alleged rape whereafter she got lodged the\n\nreport of said case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">20.   So far as variation in time mentioned in the charge\n\nframed is concerned, we are of the view that it is only when\n\nprejudice is caused to the accused in defending himself, the\n\nbenefit of such defect can be given to the accused.    <a href=\"/doc/588239/\" id=\"a_17\">Section\n\n215</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides that no error\n\nin stating either the offence or the particulars required to be\n\nstated in the charge, and no omission to state the offence of\n\nthose particulars shall be regarded at any stage of the case as\n\nmaterial unless the accused was in fact misled by such error\n\nor omission and it has occasioned a failure of justice.    The\n\nHigh Court appears to have taken a view which is contrary to\n\nthe provision contained in <a href=\"/doc/1839996/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 215</a> read with illustration\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">(d) of that Section and <a href=\"/doc/936345/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 464</a> of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">21.   We have also perused the questions put under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_20\">Section\n\n313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure and answers given by\n\nthe accused which are on the record. We do not find that in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">\f                                                     Page 21 of 36</span>\n\n\n\nthe present case spirit of <a href=\"/doc/140515/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 313</a> is forgotten, nor it can be\n\nsaid that the court has not complied with said provision.\n\nSub-section (b) of <a href=\"/doc/140515/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 313</a> requires the court to question\n\nthe accused generally on the case after the prosecution\n\nevidence is over. It does not require to re-write hundred pages\n\nevidence in another hundred pages to record the statement of\n\nthe accused under the Section. It should be borne in mind\n\nthat entire evidence has been recorded in the presence of the\n\naccused or his counsel, and before he enters into his defence,\n\nwhat is required is that he is generally asked on the case, after\n\nthe prosecution evidence is over, to explain any circumstances\n\nin the evidence against him. It does not require that each and\n\nevery sentence of the prosecution evidence has to be re-written\n\nand read over once again while examining the accused under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">22.   So far as argument that when two views are possible, the\n\nview favouring the accused should be accepted, is concerned,\n\nwe have carefully gone through the detailed judgment of the\n\ntrial court discussing every bit of evidence, and the one passed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                                    Page 22 of 36</span>\n\n\n\nby the High Court, impugned before us.       In our considered\n\nopinion from the evidence on record, the view taken by the\n\nHigh Court so far as it relates to accused Purnendu      Kumar\n\nPatra is concerned, the same is not reasonably possible view,\n\nfor the reason that it is against the weight of the evidence on\n\nrecord ignoring completely the circumstances in which the\n\nvictim reported the matter to police, with the help of a stranger\n\nand that her statement in the F.I.R is fully corroborated from\n\nthe statements of PW-1 Dipak Guchhait, PW-2 Sudha Krishna\n\nJana and PW-7 Joyram Jana, apart from the medical evidence\n\non record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">23.   In view of the above discussion, we are of the opinion\n\nthat so far as the conviction of accused-respondent Purnendu\n\nKumar Patra is concerned, the High Court has erred in\n\nholding him not guilty. In our opinion, the charge of offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 302</a> IPC is fully established on the\n\nrecord as against accused-respondent Purnendu Kumar Patra\n\nas found by the trial court.    So far as accused-respondent\n\nRabin Jana is concerned, undoubtedly he had no motive to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">\f                                                    Page 23 of 36</span>\n\n\n\ncommit the crime, nor is it found that he was having acid with\n\nhim, as such, it cannot be said that he had any common\n\nintention with accused-respondent Purnendu Kumar Patra to\n\ncause burn injuries with acid on the victim. It is possible that\n\nhe might have accompanied Purnendu Kumar Patra to\n\npressurize the victim to withdraw the rape case against him as\n\nhe was witness in said case. As such, taking such fact into\n\nconsideration by the High Court to hold him not guilty beyond\n\nreasonable doubt, cannot be said to be erroneous.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">24.   Now we have to examine the question relating to\n\nquantum of sentence.       The trial court has awarded the\n\nextreme penalty of death sentence against Purnendu Kumar\n\nPatra and the Death Reference has been rejected by the High\n\nCourt. It is settled law that life imprisonment is the rule and\n\nthe death sentence is an exception, and the death sentence\n\ncan be imposed only when life imprisonment appears to be\n\naltogether   inadequate     punishment     in    the    relevant\n\ncircumstances of the crime. In the present case, there is no\n\ncriminal history of the accused Purnendu Kumar Patra and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">\f                                                  Page 24 of 36</span>\n\n\n\nthere is no evidence that he is a continuing threat to the\n\nsociety.   Considering the fact that meanwhile Purnendu\n\nKumar Patra has been acquitted of the rape charge by the trial\n\ncourt, as is evident from Annexure R1 with the application\n\nfiled on behalf of the accused, we are of the view that on the\n\ncharge of murder, awarding sentence of imprisonment for life\n\nand direction to pay fine of Rs.10,000/- failing which to\n\nundergo rigorous imprisonment for a further period of two\n\nyears to the accused Purnendu Kumar Patra would meet the\n\nends of justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">25.   Accordingly, both the appeals are partly allowed, and\n\nacquittal of accused-respondent Purnendu Kumar Patra by the\n\nHigh Court is set aside. The conviction of said accused under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 302</a> IPC, recorded by the Additional Sessions Judge,\n\nFast Track, 1st Court, Contai, is affirmed. He is sentenced to\n\nimprisonment for life with fine of Rs.10,000/-, in default of\n\npayment of which he shall undergo rigorous imprisonment for\n\na period of two years.   Said accused- respondent Purnendu\n\nKumar Patra shall surrender forthwith before the trial court.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">\f                                                  Page 25 of 36</span>\n\n\n\nThe Registrar of the High Court of Calcutta shall ensure\n\ncompliance   of    this   order.   The   appeal   as   against\n\naccused-respondent Rabin Jana is dismissed and to that\n\nextent impugned judgment passed by the High Court stands\n\naffirmed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">                                   ……………………………….J.\n                                   [N.

Though I agree with the\n\n     findings and conclusions arrived at, by my brother, in light\n\n     of the emergent facts, it would be appropriate to pen down\n\n     my separate concurring opinion in this case.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">2. A word on criminal justice system before we deal with other aspects of this\n\n     case. Criminal    justice system is not       only about     infrastructure    or\n\n     surveillance, rather it is how we protect our country-men, it is how we\n\n     recuperate after loss, it is how we show faith in our constitution and how we\n\n     uphold the values of justice, fairness and equality. There is no dispute that\n\n     our criminal justice system is a complex one, administered at various levels\n\n     of government and fashioned by a range of actors. When such complicated\n\n     system is in place, there is a requirement for higher discipline at every level.\n\n     I am of the opinion that traditional roles played by the stake-holders in\n\n     criminal justice system would revolutionize, if there is an increased\n\n     awareness of the victim rights. Emphasis on the victim rights would bring\n\n     about public trust in our criminal justice system.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_42\">3.   A brief reference to the facts, as put forth by the\n\n     prosecution, would be necessary to dispose of this case.                      The\n\n     accused (Purnendu Kumar Patra) is alleged to have raped the deceased\n\n     (Saraswati Guchhait) on 28.04.1997. It is to be noted that the prosecution\n\n     of the rape case was pending at the time of the incident (On 27.10.1998),\n\n     when the accused have thrown acid at the deceased which caused severe\n\n     burn injuries to the body of the deceased. Thereafter she was shifted to a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                                                  Page 28 of 36</span>\n\n\n\n     local hospital on the very same day. Although   she had narrated the\n\n     incident to the doctor i.e. PW6, there was no written\n\n     complaint filed with the police.      Moreover the deceased alleged that\n\n     she was threatened by some miscreants on 29.10.1998 in the hospital. On\n\n     23.11.1998, she passed away due to shock and sepsis caused by the acid\n\n     attack. These facts lament a story of a helpless woman who was raped and\n\n     subsequently punished for raising her voice which ultimately led to her\n\n     demise.   The trial court after a full fledged trial had convicted\n\n     the accused/respondent (Purnendu Kumar Patra) under\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 302</a> of Indian Penal Code, 1860 [hereinafter ‘<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_27\">IPC</a>’ for\n\n     brevity] and sentenced him with death penalty whereas the\n\n     co-accused (Rabin Jana) was sentenced to suffer rigorous\n\n     imprisonment for life under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 302</a> of IPC and imposed\n\n     fine of Rs 25,000/-, in default thereof, to undergo further\n\n     imprisonment for a period of five years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">4.   Being dissatisfied, the accused approached the High Court\n\n     on appeal in Death Ref. No. 4 of 2005 and CRA No. 599 of\n\n     2005. The High Court while allowing appeal and dismissing\n\n     the death reference, acquitted the accused on hyper\n\n     technical grounds of delay and laches in the investigation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">\f                                                                         Page 29 of 36</span>\n\n\n\n       and prosecution. Aggrieved by the acquittal, complainant\n\n       as well as the State has filed these appeals. As we decide\n\n       these instant criminal appeals, our duty is to apply and\n\n       uphold the rule of law. As judges we are trained to do so.\n\n       We are required to adjudicate on the basis of letter and\n\n       spirit of law uninfluenced by any external circumstances.\n\n       Having done all that, we feel that the           criminal justice system   has\n\n       not served the deceased from being victimized.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">    5. At the outset certain aspects on the acid attack needs to be observed.\n\n       Usually vitriolage or acid attack has transformed itself as a gender based\n\n       violence. Acid attacks not only cause damage to the physical appearance of\n\n       its victims but also cause immense psychological trauma thereby becoming\n\n       a hurdle in their overall development.

For 26 days she was struggling\n\n         between life and death in the hospital. Interestingly, there\n\n         was no dying declaration recorded. It is specifically\n\n         admitted by the treating doctor that the I.O. had requested\n\n         for recording a dying declaration on 07.11.1998, which was\n\n         not allowed by him as he thought that she was responding\n\n         well to the treatment but at the same time he admits that\n\n         the general condition of the patient was very poor. Further\n\n         he admits that she was not examined before tendering such\n\n         opinion and proper case history was also not maintained.\n\n         Therefore the conduct of the doctor (PW 6) needs to be\n\n         evaluated in light of his utter disregard for professionalism.\n\n         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"16029001\" id=\"span_35\">In criminal cases, doctors inevitably play a very important\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">2</span>\n\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/16029001/\" id=\"a_30\">Parivartan Kendra v.
