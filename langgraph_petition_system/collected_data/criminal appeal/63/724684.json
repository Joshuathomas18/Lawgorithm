RAJU, J.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\tThese two appeals are dealt with together, since they relate to the\nsame occurrence and arise out of a common judgment of the court below.\nThe appellant in Criminal Appeal No.634 of 2001 was accused No.1 and the\nthird accused is appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1191 of 2001.\tThese two\nalong with Harvinder Singh (A2), Tikka Singh (A4) and Jaswant Singh (A5)\nstood charged before the learned Additional Sessions Judge, Yamuna Nagar\nat Jagadhri, under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_2\">148</a> and <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_3\">149</a> of the Indian Penal Code, for\nhaving caused the death of Naresh Kumar, brother of PWs-8 and 10, and son\nof PW-11, at about 8 or 8.30 P.M. on 9.11.1990.\t Accused Nos.1 and 2 are\nown brothers and son of one Baldev Singh, accused No.3 is the brother&#x27;s son\nof Baldev Singh and cousin of A1 and A2, and while A4 is the friend of\nBaldev Singh, A5 is the servant of Baldev Singh.  After trial, the learned\nTrial Judge by his Judgment dated 7.10.1995 found A1 (Jagtar Singh) guilty\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 302</a>, IPC, and acquitted all others holding that the prosecution\nhas not been able to prove the charges against them beyond all reasonable\ndoubt.\tA1 was consequently sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment\nfor life, in addition to payment of fine of Rs.5,000/- and two years R.I. in\ncase of default in payment of the same.\t A1 filed Criminal Appeal No.532-\nDB.of 1995 and the State filed Criminal Appeal No.193-DB of 1996\nquestioning the acquittal of the other accused.\t The learned Judges of the\nDivision Bench in the High Court, by its judgment dated 8.1.2001,\ndismissed the appeal filed by A1 and partly allowed the State appeal so far\nas A3 is concerned and convicted him under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 302</a>, IPC, read with\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 34</a>, IPC, and sentenced him to imprisonment for life, in addition to\nthe levy of a find of Rs.5,000/- with a default clause. Hence, these appeals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">\tThe case as disclosed from the evidence of Prosecution Witnesses\nmay have to be briefly stated to appreciate respective contention of the\nparties before us. The complainant party had a sugarcane crusher in the land\nadjoining the lands of Baldev Singh.  On 8.11.1990, A3 and two others came\nto the cane crusher where besides PW-8, his father; two brothers (Ramesh\nand Naresh) were present and abused them.  On 9.11.1990, a Panchayat was\nsaid to have been convened in the Village Chouwala, which was said to have\nincluded also Sumer Chand (PW-3) besides Avtar, Ram Saroup, and one\nanother person.\t It was stated that since A3 and others admitted their\nmisconduct and it was decided that in case of any misbehaviour at any time\nthereafter, A3 will pay Rs.10,000/- as fine and if the other party misbehaved,\nthey will pay Rs.3,000/- to the other party, respectively.  The admitted case\nof the prosecution is that everything relating to the said Panchayat and the\ndecision therein was oral and there was nothing in writing.  Later in the\nevening on that day at about 4.30/5.00 P.M., the deceased and PW-8 left for\nBilaspur in a Tonga belonging to Sheo Ram, who also drove the Tonga for\nselling the Gur weighing about one quintal.  The same was said to have been\nsold to PW-6, Ram Lal, for Rs.400/- by the deceased who handed over the\nsame to PW-8 and both were returning by the same Tonga to their Village\nChouwala, the deceased and Tongawala seated on the front seat and PW-8\nseated on the back, by about 8.00/8.15 P.M.  When they were near the lands\nof Baldev on the link road of Ram Khera to Chouwala, the five accused,\narmed with lathis, raised lalkara that PW-8 and the deceased should not be\nallowed to go.\tA1 was said to have given a lathi blow, which hit the Tonga\nand PW-8 jumped from the Tonga.\t In the meantime, A3 was said to have\ngiven a lathi blow to the deceased on his head and the Tongawala also seems\nto have ran away.  PW-8 was said to have been watching what has happened\nfrom a distance of 25 paces and all the accused gave lathi blows on the\ndeceased and by the time PW-8, who was hiding behind a tree, raised an\nalarm, all ran away from the spot with their respective weapons.   It was also\nclaimed that since each were in the process of assault calling the other by\nnames, he could identify them from their voices, being known persons.\nThereafter, PW-8, driving the Tonga brought the deceased, said to be\nconscious at that time to their house and both narrated the incident to their\nfather as well as the other brother.  Thereupon PW-8, PW-11 and PW-3\nbrought the deceased in the Trolley of PW-3 to Civil Hospital, Jagadhri, and\non the way the deceased was said to have become unconscious.  Later, it\nappears that the victim died at the Hospital at about 4.00 A.M. on\n10.11.1990.   Earlier on the report sent by the Doctor (PW-9) at about 11.15\nP.M. about the serious condition of the victim to the Police, the ASI came to\nthe Hospital at about 1.45 A.M and recorded the statement of PW-8 and\ncaused the case to be registered.   After receiving the report about the death\nof the victim, and holding the inquest as well as arranging for the conduct of\npost mortem and further investigation was set in motion and on completion\nof the investigation, the Police laid charge only against A3 to A5 for an\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 34</a>, IPC.  It is only after\nexamination of witnesses during trial, an order came to be made under\n<a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 319</a>, Cr.P.C., A1 and A2 were also summoned to face trial and fresh\ntrial was held against all the accused for offences under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_11\">148</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_12\">149</a>, IPC, resulting in the convictions, as noticed supra.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">\tShri Sushil Kumar, learned Senior Advocate, and Shri K.B. Sinha,\nlearned Senior Advocate, appeared for the appellants in Criminal Appeal\nNo.634 of 2001 and Criminal Appeal No.1191 of 2001 respectively, whereas\nShri J.P. Dhanda, learned counsel, was heard for the respondent-State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">\tIt was strenuously contended for the appellant in Criminal Appeal\nNo.634 of 2001 that the courts below including the High Court having not\naccepted the claim of prosecution of the recoveries made and disbelieved the\nversion of the father (PW-11) on the alleged oral dying declaration of the\ndeceased, there was hardly any justification for the High Court to reverse the\nverdict of acquittal recorded by the learned Trial Judge in respect of the said\nappellant.  The further contention on behalf of this appellant was that the\nevidence of PW-8, the brother, who claims to have accompanied the\ndeceased in the Tonga when the incident occurred, could not, with so many\nglaring infirmities affecting its credibility, be the basis of conviction and that\ntoo by reversing an acquittal in favour of this appellant.  Inviting our\nattention to the relevant portions of the judgment of the High Court, wherein\nconsideration has been made of the case pertaining to this appellant and the\nother appellant before this Court, it is also contended that the manner of\nconsideration could hardly be said to be an objective one, sufficient and\njustifying to set aside the findings of the Trial Court acquitting this\nappellant.  To appreciate this part of grievance, it is useful to advert to the\nvery relevant portion of the judgment of the High Court, which reads as\nhereunder: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;Coming to the rest of the case, it is the consistent\ncontention of the Krishan Gopal right from the first\ninformation report that Jagtar Singh had attempted\nto give a blow on his person but it hit the Tonga and\nbecause of that Tonga driver ran away to a distance.\nThis facilitated the blow given by Sardul Singh on\nthe head of the deceased.  Identity of Sardul Singh is\nmentioned in the first information report as well as\nin the statement of Krishan Gopal on oath.  We find\nthat the statement of Krishan Gopal is consistent and\ninspire confidence in its truthfulness so far as the\nrole of these two persons is concerned, i.e., Jagtar\nSingh and Sardul Singh.\t Sardul Singh had also gone\nto the crusher of the complainant on the previous\nday and that too under the influence of liquor and\nhad threatened.\t He had to make a clean breast of his\nfault before the Panchayat.  He has a clear motive to\navenge his prestige, which was in his mind because\nthe complainant reported to the Panchayat.  So when\nevidence comes against Sardul Singh accused and he\ndid not even bring an inkling in the defence to say\nthat he never confessed before the Panchayat nor did\nhe go to the crusher of the complainant and did not\nmisbehave.  It cannot be imagined that the\nprosecution evidence to that extent is doubtful and\nrather it stands established.  The parties were known\nto each other intimately.  It is immaterial that the\noccurrence took place around 8.30 P.M. and it was\ndark but still there was nothing to prevent the\ncomplainant side from identifying the assailants.\nThe assailants had come near the Tonga and the\nassault was from very close range.  Therefore, there\ncould not be any mistake about it.  Similarly,\nrecording of the First Information Report in such a\ncase also could not be said to be delayed when the\nstatement is recorded at 2.30 A.M. and the first\ninformation report was recorded at 2.55 A.M.  The\ncomplainant has explained that he had taken the\ndeceased at home first of all.\tThere appears to be\nnothing to be manipulated in the investigation.\t The\nexplanation mentioned by the complainant is\nsufficient to dispel the impression that anything was\nrequired to be manipulated.  There is nothing\nsufficient to suggest that the accused were involved\nat the instance of Sumer Chand due to election\nrivalry.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">The learned Trial Judge has mentioned that the stick\nEx.P1 was so soft that it did not cause the injuries\nfound on the person of the deceased.  Dr. M.R. Passi\nPW.9 has only suggested that it is less likely that\ninjuries on the head of the deceased could be caused\nby stick Ex.P1.\t It could not be taken to mean that\nthe blows from the stick made of popular tree branch\ncould not cause injuries on the person of the\ndeceased.  The other point taken by the learned Trial\nJudge was that the blood group on the stick was not\nproved to be matching with the blood of the\ndeceased.  We do not find that these are sufficient\ngrounds to disbelieve the over whelming evidence\nwith regard to the participation of Sardul Singh in\nthe occurrence and giving injuries to the deceased.\nSo in the given circumstances, we are fully\nconvinced that Sardul Singh could not have been\nexonerated of his guilt.  He is thus liable for the\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 34</a> of\nthe Indian Penal Code.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">\tStrong exception is also taken to some of the observations and\nconclusions therein on the ground that they do not find any support from the\nmaterials on record and that on the other hand on vital aspects unwarranted\ninferences have been drawn in utter disregard of categorical and specific\nfindings stated to have been otherwise recorded by the learned Trial Judge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\tOn behalf of the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1191 of 2001, it\nwas forcefully contended, in addition to adopting the submissions made on\nbehalf of the other appellant, that there are no legally acceptable materials to\nprove the alleged guilt of this appellant and they were involved and\nimplicated falsely due to some election rivalry at the instance of PW-3 who\ncontested unsuccessfully against the father of this appellant for the office of\nSarpanch.  According to the learned senior counsel, it was a case of blind\nmurder and except the fact that the son of PW-11 died, there was nothing\ncredible on evidence to connect the appellant with the incident.  The non-\nexamination of the Tonga driver and the other independent, alleged\npanchyatdars have been strongly criticised stating that the same was meant\nto shield the falsity of the prosecution case and avoid the real truth also\ncoming to light.  Some of the conclusions of the courts below, according to\nthe learned counsel, if pursued to its logical end would necessarily lead to\nthe innocence of this appellant also.  It was alternatively contended that even\non the facts, as claimed to have been proved, the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 302</a>\nread with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 34</a> IPC could not be said to have been established, and if\nat all, it could be only for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 323</a> IPC that this\nappellant could be convicted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">\tWe have carefully considered the submissions made on behalf of the\nappellants, in the light of the evidence on record and the findings recorded\nby the courts below, though at variance on some aspects and by way of\naffirmation on several other aspects.  The case against both the appellants\nmainly rests upon the evidence of PW-8, no doubt the brother of the victim,\nthe only ocular witness who claims to have accompanied the deceased and\nwas on and near the site of occurrence.\t No one else has claimed to have\nwitnessed the occurrence.  The only other person, who could have spoken as\nto what had happened on the spot, was the Tonga driver, and his non-\nexamination was said to be a vitiating factor and really an attempt to\nwithhold best evidence, by the prosecution.  The A.P.P. for the State, on\n17.1.94 has given up Ram Saroup, Shiv Ram and Avtar Singh, cited as PWs\nfor the reason that they have been won over and PW Premchand as\nunnecessary.  PW-12, the Inspector/SHO of Jagadhri Police Station, who\nwas examined on 7.7.94, though claimed to have recorded a statement of\nSheoram, nothing substantial has been made out, to adversely affect the\nversion of Prosecution Witnesses, from the mere non-examination of this\nperson, who drove the Tonga, since he also ran away from the spot.  The\nlapse of I.O. in not getting the Tonga inspected or seized cannot be such as\nto affect the credibility of the prosecution case, since the fact about the travel\nin the Tonga stood otherwise established sufficiently.\tFurther, from the non-\nexamination of the other so-called panchayatdars who could have spoken\nonly about the holding of the alleged Panchyat and the decision taken which\nfactor, if at all, could become also relevant to prove only any immediate\nprovocation for the assault, cannot be a justification to totally reject the\nprosecution case.  Having regard to the fact that the father of A1 and A2 is\nthe Sarpanch and influential, the apprehension of the prosecution that those\nwitnesses were won over cannot be outright brushed aside as a mere\npretence for something else.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"593857\" id=\"span_1\">There cannot be a prosecution case with a cast iron perfection in all\nrespects and it is obligatory for the courts to analyse, sift and assess the\nevidence on record, with particular reference to its trustworthiness and\ntruthfulness, by a process of dispassionate judicial scrutiny adopting an\nobjective and reasonable appreciation of the same, without being obsessed\nby an air of total suspicion of the case of the prosecution.  What is to be\ninsisted upon is not implicit proof.  It has often been said that evidence of\ninterested witnesses should be scrutinized more carefully to find out whether\nit has a ring of truth and if found acceptable and seem to inspire confidence,\ntoo, in the mind of the court, the same cannot be discarded totally merely on\naccount of certain variations or infirmities pointed or even additions and\nembellishments noticed, unless they are of such nature as to undermine the\nsubstratum of the evidence and found to be tainted to the core.\t Courts have\na duty to undertake a complete and comprehensive appreciation of all vital\nfeatures of the case and the entire evidence with reference to the broad and\nreasonable probabilities of the case also in their attempt to find out proof\nbeyond reasonable doubt.  This Court in <a href=\"/doc/593857/\" id=\"a_18\">Ugar Ahir &amp; Others vs. The State\nof Bihar</a> (AIR 1965 SC 277) has observed, as to what should be the\napproach of a Court in such circumstances, as follows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">&quot;6. The maxim falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus\n(false in one thing, false in every thing) is neither a\nsound rule of law nor a rule of practice.  Hardly\none comes across a witness whose evidence does\nnot contain a grain of untruth or at any rate\nexaggerations, embroideries or embellishments.\tIt\nis, therefore, the duty of the court to scrutinize the\nevidence carefully and, in terms of the felicitous\nmetaphor, separate the grain from the chaff.  But, it\ncannot obviously disbelieve the substratum of the\nprosecution case or the material parts of the\nevidence and reconstruct a story of its own out of\nthe rest.  That is what the courts have done in this\ncase.  In effect, the courts disbelieved practically\nthe whole version given by the witnesses in regard\nto the pursuit, the assault on the deceased with\nlathis, the accused going on a bicycle, and the\ndeceased wresting the bhala from one of the\nappellants and attacking with the same two of the\nappellants, the case that the accused attacked the\nwitnesses, and the assertion of the witnesses of\ntheir being disinterested spectators.  If all this was\ndisbelieved, what else remained?  To reverse the\nmetaphor, the courts removed the grain and\naccepted the chaff and convicted the appellants.\nWe, therefore, set aside the conviction of the\nappellants and the sentence passed on them.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">\tComing to the facts of the case on hand, if the evidence of PW-8 is\nfound to inspire confidence and considered to be truthful and acceptable, it\nwould be the direct ocular evidence for the occurrence sufficient to indict the\nappellants.  It is the quality of the evidence and not merely the quantity that\nreally matters.\t So far as the evidence of PW-8 is concerned, the Trial Court,\nwhich had the opportunity to observe the general tenor of the evidence given\nby the various witnesses, was of the view that he was an eyewitness to the\noccurrence and it was possible for him to identify A1.\tAs for the others and\nparticularly A3, the trial court proceeded to acquit merely because PW-8\ncould not identify the remaining accused due to darkness except by their\nvoices and that Ex.P-1 was not shown sufficiently to be the same Danda\nwhich was used by A3 to inflict injuries and the theory of Panchyat was not\na sufficient motive to commit such a heinous crime.  It may be noticed at\nthis stage that &#x27;motive&#x27;, which is not always capable of precise proof, if\nproved, may only lend additional support to strengthen the probability of\ncommission of the offence by the person accused but the absence of proof\ndoes not ipso facto warrant an acquittal.  The Trial Court further came to the\nconclusion that A1 was one of the members of the assailants and the\nstatement of PW-8 cannot be believed to say that he had recognised the other\npersons in the dark or from their voices.  It would be appropriate, at this\npoint, to carefully see whether this manner reading of the evidence by the\nTrial Court was accurate or the correct reading of the evidence. PW-8 spoke\nnot only about the involvement of A3 in the altercation resulting in\nPanchayat but also about his noticing five persons inclusive of A1 and A3,\narmed with lathis as they reached near the fields of Baldev Singh.  The\nrelevant portion as to the actual occurrence as per the statement on record in\nchief reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">&quot;All of them said that I and Naresh should not be\nallowed to go.\tThen Jagtar gave a lathi blow,\nwhich hit the Tonga.  Then I jumped from the\nTonga.\tIn the meantime, Sardul accused gave lathi\nblow to Naresh, which hit him on his head.  I was\nat a distance of 10-15 paces and I saw that all the\naccused gave lathi blows to my brother Naresh.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">\tDuring the course of cross-examination PW-8 stated, in respect of this\naspect, as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">&quot;It was dark night on the night of occurrence but I\nhad seen the faces of all the accused while sitting\nin the Tonga.  It is correct that I had said in my\nstatement in the court previously that I was at a\ndistance of 25 paces from the accused and that I\nhad identified them from their voices, as they were\ncalling each other by name, as I knew them\nearlier.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">\tTherefore, it could be seen that the lathi blow said to have been given\nby A-3 also was before he ran to some distance and watched all the accused\n(referring to all of them generally) as they gave lathi blows and this\nidentification claimed from their voices was really with reference to the\ngeneral accusation against all in the later portion and not to be connected\nwith reference to the blow said to have been given also by A3 on the head of\nthe deceased, stated in positive and unmistakable words.  There could be no\ndifferential treatment or approach in this regard between A1 and A3 in\nrespect of their role and both are found identified and fixed directly with\nreference to a positive and overt act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\tSo far as the High Court is concerned, it rightly took notice of the fact\nthat PW-8 has mentioned the identity of A3 in the FIR as well as in court\nand that the evidence in this regard was consistent and inspired confidence\nof acceptance.\tMerely because the High Court proceeded to refer to some\nother material also, incorrect or irrelevant, it does not vitiate the positive\nfinding otherwise justifiably recorded in the same manner and by adopting\nthe same standard or process of reasoning as in respect of A1.\tThe reasons\nassigned in the penultimate paragraph of the judgment of the High Court are\nrelevant and vital, though wholly lost sight of by the Trial Court, and this\nomission not only necessitated but justified the approach and the conclusion\narrived at by the High Court in respect of the guilt of A3.  When the Trial\nCourt was found to have wrongly read and thereby mis-appreciated the\nevidence and arrived at grossly unjust conclusions, the High Court was\nentitled to interfere in the appeal, to set right the manifest injustice resulting\nfrom the decision of the Trial Court and that is really what seem to have\nbeen done by the High Court in this case.  Consequently, there is no scope\nfor interfering with the finding recorded that A3 was also present on the spot\nand participated in the assault on the deceased on the fateful day along with\nA1.  The medical opinion about the number and nature of injuries would\nlend further credence and corroboration to such participation by both A1 and\nA3.  The High Court cannot be said to have committed any error or\nexceeded the parameters laid down for interfering with the verdict of\nacquittal recorded by the trial court in respect of A-3, having regard to the\nmanifestly erroneous evaluation of the evidence in this regard by the trial\ncourt, resulting in grave injustice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\tThe next important question is as to what would be the nature of\noffence really committed, on the facts proved by the prosecution.  The sticks\nsaid to have been used and recovered are of &#x27;Popular tree&#x27;, the wood of\nwhich was considered to be soft and light and stated to be usually used for\nmanufacturing match sticks.  While testifying on oath before Court, PW-8\nhas only stated that he and the deceased &#x27;should not be allowed to go&#x27; and\nnot allowed to go alive or must be finished.  This factor taken together with\nthe nature of sticks used and the admitted rivalry on account of some\nelections would indicate that the accused meant at best, to give a sound\nthrashing to the victim.  Since it was during night-time, some of the blows\nmight have also landed on the vital portion of the head, even in the absence\nof any deliberate intention to kill and, therefore, be possibly inferred from\nthe facts proved.  The intention to cause death or cause such bodily injury as\nwas likely to cause death in the normal or ordinary course cannot be readily\nimputed to the accused.\t Taken individually or even jointly together, if at all\nthe common intention could have been merely to commit an assault and\ninflict some injuries but not to cause such injuries as would or is likely to\ncause or result in death.  Therefore, A1 and A3 could not be condemned to\nhave committed the murder, though that seems to have been the unintended\nultimate result.  On the facts proved, the accused could only be safely\nconvicted under <a href=\"/doc/1133601/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 325</a> IPC and not under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 302</a> IPC.\tThe plea\nthat it would attract only punishment under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 323</a> cannot be\ncountenanced having regard to the grievous nature of the injuries sustained\nby the victim.\tThese appeals, therefore, merit acceptance only in part, not\nfor any clean acquittal, but for acquittal in respect of the offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 302</a> IPC and instead, conviction of both the appellants under <a href=\"/doc/1133601/\" id=\"a_23\">Section\n325</a> IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 34</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">\tKeeping in view the overall circumstances of the case, the age and\nlapse of time etc., a sentence of two years RI with a fine of Rs.10,000/- each\nwould be reasonable and sufficiently meet the ends of justice.\tAccordingly,\nthe appellants (A1 and A3) shall stand convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1133601/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 325</a> IPC read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 34</a> IPC and sentenced to undergo two years rigorous\nimprisonment and further pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- each, in default whereof\nto undergo rigorous imprisonment for one year more.
