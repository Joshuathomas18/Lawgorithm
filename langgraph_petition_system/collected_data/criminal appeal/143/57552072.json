This is\n     besides reiterating that there is no material against\n     the petitioner whereas the learned counsel for the\n     State would, on her part, reiterate that it is a\n     matter where very serious offences are alleged and is\n     not a case where bail may be granted to the\n     petitioner.    She further would point out that the\n     trial is progressing and the State is also taking\n     effective steps for an early disposal of the matter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">            We are of the view that in the facts of this\n     case, when the petitioner has already spent nearly 8\n     years in custody, the appropriate order to pass would\n     be to first direct the examination of the three\n     witnesses who have raised concerns about threat to\n     their lives from the accused and the matter should\n     receive attention of this Court after their evidence\n     is adduced.

Yet another reason which persuades us to enlarge\n      the respondent on bail is that <a href=\"/doc/165949346/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 43-D(5)</a> of the\n      UAPA is comparatively less stringent than <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 37</a>\n      of the NDPS Act. Unlike the NDPS Act where the\n      competent court needs to be satisfied that prima facie\n      the accused is not guilty and that he is unlikely to\n      commit another offence while on bail; there is no such\n      precondition under UAPA. Instead, <a href=\"/doc/165949346/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 43-D(5)</a> of\n      the UAPA merely provides another possible ground for\n      the competent court to refuse bail, in addition to the\n      well-settled   considerations  like   gravity  of  the\n      offence, possibility of tampering with evidence,\n      influencing the witnesses or chance of the accused\n      evading the trial by absconsion, etc.”\n\n\n(10) No doubt, in the said case, as pointed out by the\n\nlearned counsel appearing on behalf of the State, the Court\n\nwas dealing with an order passed by the High Court granting\n\nbail, whereas, in this case, the converse is true, that is,\n\nthe   impugned       order    is     one    rejecting          the   application      for\n\nbail.     The    fact      remains     that       the     appellant     has    been   in\n\ncustody as an undertrial prisoner for a period of nearly 8\n\nyears already.         The appellant, it may be noted, is charged\n\nwith offences, some of which are punishable with a minimum\n\npunishment      of    10     years    and        the    sentence     may     extend   to\n\nimprisonment for life.                Learned counsel for the appellant\n\nalso points out that one of the co-accused namely Shri Aadil\n\nAnsari   has    been       released        on    bail     on    30.09.2020     by    this\n\nCourt.     No    doubt,       in   this         regard,    we    keep   in    mind    the\n\nsubmission of the State that the role attributed to the said\n\naccused is different.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                                            6</span>\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 605/ 2022 (@ SLP (Crl.)
