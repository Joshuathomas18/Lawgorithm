These five appeals presented under <a href=\"/doc/328835/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 42</a> of the Prevention\nof Money-Laundering Act, 2002 (&quot;PMLA&quot;, for short) against more or\nless similar orders of the appellate tribunal (constituted under Section\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">25), such orders having been rendered on appeals of the respondents\n(&quot;banks&quot;) vis-Ã -vis the orders of provisional attachment issued by the\nenforcement officers under <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 5</a>, as confirmed by the\nadjudicating authority under <a href=\"/doc/449543/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 8</a>, give rise, inter alia, to certain\ncommon questions of law of import concerning nature of property that\nmay be attached under this special law as indeed the conflict arising\nfrom claim of bonafide acquisition of interest by third parties. Hence,\nthey have been heard together and are being decided by this common\njudgment.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">Crl.

The measure of attachment of property involved in &quot;money\nlaundering&quot;, it essentially representing &quot;proceeds of crime&quot; (as\ndefined in law), is provided to ensure that the ultimate objective of\n&quot;confiscation&quot; of such ill-gotten property be not frustrated, the power\nand jurisdiction to order confiscation being vested in the Special\nCourt. As would be seen at length in later part of this judgment, the\nprovisions for attachment (followed by adjudication) leading to\nconfiscation are sanctions in addition to the criminal sanction\nrendering the act of &quot;money laundering&quot; a penal offence (by virtue of\n<a href=\"/doc/1182345/\" id=\"a_4\">section 4</a>). The order of &quot;confiscation&quot; of property attached under\nPMLA takes away the right and title of its owner and vests it\n&quot;absolutely in the Central Government free from all encumbrances&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">(<a href=\"/doc/1080526/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 9</a>).\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">3.      The appeals at hand relate to claims of entities other than the\npersons in whose name the attached properties are held - to be\nreferred hereinafter as &quot;third party&quot; - such claims of the third party\nemanating from charge, lien or encumbrances legitimately created. To\nput it simply, the conflict meriting resolve here concerns the sovereign\nauthority of the State to take away and confiscate the property which\nhas been acquired by a person through criminal activity as against the\nlawful claim of a third party to reach out to such property to recover,\nin accordance with law, what is due by attachment and sale of same\nvery property.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">Crl.

Bearing in mind the above, the learned counsel on both sides of\nthe divide in these matters repeatedly submitted that the issues\npresently brought for adjudication are not adversarial in nature, in that\nboth sides concededly have been given certain authority by law to\nreach out to the properties in question for their respective purposes,\nthe challenge essentially being to prioritize the claims of one over the\nother. The appellate tribunal (as constituted under PMLA), by its\nimpugned orders, has taken the view that the relevant statutory\nprovisions of PMLA take a back seat, the enactments under which the\nthird parties (the banks) lay a superior claim over the properties in\nquestion having primacy.           The appellant assails the said view\nquestioning the correctness of the logic and reasoning by which the\nappellate tribunal has so concluded arguing that if the decision of the\ntribunal were to prevail it would not only be prone to misuse but also\nrender PMLA toothless.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">                                    THE FACTS\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.

The Government of India had announced             demonetization\npolicy on 08.11.2016, in terms of which the then existing Indian\ncurrency notes of the denomination of Rs.1,000/- and Rs.500/- ceased\nto be legal tender, a window having been provided for exchange of\ndemonetized notes, with the new currency introduced, by deposit in\nthe bank accounts.           On 29.11.2016, three persons (including one\nMohit Garg) travelling in a car were intercepted in the area of police\nstation Kashmere Gate, their search revealing unaccounted and\nunauthorized possession of four bags containing demonetized\ncurrency notes of the face value of Rs.1,000/- each, totaling worth\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">Crl.

It is\nfurther stated that the evidence has been collected to show that Rajeev\nSingh Kushwaha had floated certain fictitious companies, one of his\nassociates (Mohit Garg) providing services of an entry operator. It is\nalso stated that the evidence collected has shown that a criminal\nconspiracy was hatched pursuant to which the individuals who were\nintercepted, alongwith others, including Rajeev Singh Kushwaha, had\nindulged in acts to convert unaccounted demonetized currency by\ndepositing the same in above mentioned fictitious companies of\nRajeev Singh Kushwaha, for consideration, so as to project the same\nas untainted money. It is alleged that the above mentioned two bank\nofficials had actively participated in the said transactions leading to\nthe demonetized currency being channelized into the fictitious\naccounts, they having taken illegal gratification, in the form of cash or\ngold, from Rajeev Singh Kushwaha.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">Crl.

The accounts of the above-mentioned four fictitious companies\nsaw demonetized currency being deposited to the tune of Rs.39.26\nCrores during the period 10.11.2016 to 21.11.2016.                Certain\nrecoveries, including in the form of gold, statedly proceeds of the\nabove-said crimes, were effected from close associates of Rajeev\nSingh Kushwaha.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">11.      Primarily on the basis of above-mentioned facts, and the\nmaterial gathered during investigation into the police case, it involving\nscheduled offences, information was also conveyed to enforcement\nauthorities, which resulted in ECIR no.11/2016 being registered on\n30.11.2016 under PMLA.

These include the Audi car. The\nadjudicating authority, by its order dated 31.05.2017, confirmed the\nattachment order.

It is clear from the background facts of these five appeals that\nthe properties which have been targeted in most of the corresponding\ncases for attachment by the enforcement authority under PMLA are\nnot properties which can be described even remotely to be those which\nhad been derived or obtained as a result of criminal activity leading to\ncommission of money-laundering.        All such assets were acquired\nmuch prior to the acts of commission or omission relating to money-\nlaundering. The assets in question seem to be held in the name of, or\nowned by, persons against whom there is material available forming\nthe basis of reasons to believe of complicity in money-laundering. But\nthe properties which were attached are not product of money-\nlaundering, the enforcement authority concededly having moved\nagainst such properties because there are reasons to believe that they\nare properties of value equivalent to the assets that may have been\nacquired, derived or obtained as a result of money-laundering. To put\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Crl. Appeal No.143/2018 &amp; others                           Page 21 of 105</span>\n it simply, it appears that the enforcement authority having not been\nable to lay its hands on the property derived or obtained from money\nlaundering has proceeded to reach out to other assets of the suspects\nthat appear prima facie to have been acquired earlier from legitimate\nmeans because they are properties of the same value as would have\nbeen the value of the pecuniary advantage gained by money-\nlaundering.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">46.     It is in the above context that the conflicts involving third party\nclaims have arisen because the respondents (banks) claim to have\nacquired lawful interest (by mortgage or hypothecation) in the\nproperties (which have been attached) in due course of their banking\nactivities. It is not disputed that neither the concerned bank nor any of\nits agents or employees have had any connection whatsoever with any\nact of commission or omission relating to the money-laundering of\nwhich the borrowers are accused in these cases.           It is also well\nconceded by the State (the appellant) that the banks in these matters\nmay be entitled to and may have been pursuing lawful remedies\nwhere-under these very properties can be legitimately attached and\nsold, by public auction, to satisfy their respective claims, such\nsatisfaction, in turn, concededly giving a lawful discharge to the\nborrowers for the corresponding debt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_58\">47.     It is argued that if the contentions of the respondent banks were\nto be upheld and the view taken by the appellate tribunal endorsed, the\nlaw under PMLA would stand defeated, not only because the\nsovereign authority to take away the property of the money-launderer\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">Crl. Appeal No.143/2018 &amp; others                             Page 22 of 105</span>\n &quot;free from all encumbrances&quot; would stand frustrated, but also because\nthe wrong-doer (the borrower who has indulged in money-laundering)\nwould derive illegitimate pecuniary advantage by getting a discharge\nfor the debt by using an asset the right to hold which had been\nforfeited.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_59\">48.     Conversely, it is argued that the legislative intent and command\nis that the RDDBFI Act (or &quot;RDBA&quot;) and <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_39\">SARFAESI Act</a> (as also the\nInsolvency Code) must prevail over PMLA, the authority of\nenforcement agency taking a back-seat. At the same time, it was\nurged that a harmonious construction of PMLA and the legislations\n(RDBA and SARFAESI Act) under which the respondent banks\n(&quot;secured creditors&quot;) seek remedy has to be achieved such that the\nobjective of each is sub-served, none defeated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_60\">           SANCTIONS AGAINST MONEY-LAUNDERING\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">49.

At\nleast two international organisations (the European Commission and\nthe Gulf Cooperation Council) and a number of sovereign States had\nset up an inter-governmental body called the Financial Action Task\nForce (FATF) on Money-Laundering with the objective of\ndevelopment and promotion of policies to combat the menace. The\nFATF, by its recommendations made in 1990, suggested measures to\nbe adopted similar to those set forth in the Vienna Convention (on\ncriminalizing the drug money laundering) including legislative ones,\nto enable their competent authorities to confiscate property laundered,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Crl.

By its document titled &quot;The Forty\nRecommendations&quot; (1996), it reiterated the said suggestion for\nlegislative measures to be adopted for confiscation of such assets or\n&quot;property of corresponding value&quot;, cautioning that such measures be\n&quot;without prejudicing the rights of bona fide third parties&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">50.     <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_40\">The Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002</a> (&quot;PMLA&quot;)\nthough enacted and notified on 17th January, 2003, came into force\nw.e.f. 01.07.2005 and has been amended more than once, lastly by the\n<a href=\"/doc/75703920/\" id=\"a_41\">Finance Act, 2018</a> and the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment)\nAct, 2018.

The PMLA deals with &quot;money-laundering&quot;, treating it as an\noffence, defining it thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        &quot;3.Offence of money-laundering.--Whosoever directly or\n        indirectly attempts to indulge or knowingly assists or\n        knowingly is a party or is actually involved in any\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">Crl.

The challenge posed by money-laundering is intended to be met\nby the legislation through measures which include penal consequences\nfor the offence (<a href=\"/doc/20781376/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 4</a>) and by deprivation of the &quot;proceeds of\ncrime&quot; through &quot;confiscation&quot;, the latter being a process which\ncommences with order of &quot;attachment&quot;. In such context, detailed\nprovisions are also made for reciprocal arrangement (9th chapter) for\nassistance to be given by India to other sovereign States or expected\nby from the latter vis-Ã -vis property that is subject matter of money-\nlaundering, this being dependent upon agreements to such effect being\nentered into by India with other countries.          Similarly, the law\nenvisages certain obligations (4th chapter) on the part of banking\ncompanies, financial institutions and intermediaries to render\nassistance to the enforcement agency not only by maintaining records\nbut also reporting, or giving access, to information about certain\ntransactions for dealing with the scourge of money-laundering. The\nPMLA establishes an enforcement agency, collectively described as\n&quot;Authorities&quot; (8th Chapter) and criminal justice fora styled as &quot;Special\nCourts&quot; (7th chapter) conferring, by Section 44, upon the latter (i.e. the\nspecial courts), exclusive jurisdiction to try the offence (under Section\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">4) of &quot;money-laundering&quot; and any &quot;scheduled offence&quot; connected\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">Crl.

For comprehensive understanding of the law on money-\nlaundering (under PMLA), it may also be noted here that the\nexpression &quot;proceeds of crime&quot; constitutes the core of the offence of\nmoney-laundering, &quot;the concealment, possession, acquisition or use&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">of &quot;proceeds of crime&quot; in a manner where the same are projected or\nare claimed to be &quot;untainted property&quot; being what forms the essential\npart of actus reus, the intent to so conceal, possess, acquire or use, or\nguilty knowledge, being the requisite mens rea. It is inherent in this\nthat prior to coming in possession, acquisition, concealment or use of\n&quot;tainted property&quot; (the claim being to the contrary that it is untainted\nproperty) there must have been some other offence committed, the\nproperty perceived or alleged to be tainted being the product of such\ncriminal activity.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">54.     It is in the above sense that the expression &quot;proceeds of crime&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">is defined in PMLA, by <a href=\"/doc/168773879/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 2 (1) (u)</a>. It is not any or every crime,\nthe fruits whereof would be treated as &quot;proceeds of crime&quot; for\ninitiation of action under PMLA. The enactment restricts it to the\n&quot;result of criminal activity&quot; relating to a &quot;scheduled offence&quot;. The\nexpression &quot;scheduled offence&quot; is defined by <a href=\"/doc/113066886/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 2 (1) (y)</a> as\nunder:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        &quot;scheduled offence&quot; means--\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        (i) the offences specified under Part A of the Schedule; or\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">Crl.

While Part âCâ of the schedule concerns certain offences which\nhave &quot;cross-border implications&quot;, Part âBâ is restricted to the offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/852376/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 132</a> of the Customs Act, 1962. In contrast, Part âAâ\ncomprises of twenty-nine paragraphs thereby including offences under\nmany a penal law they including certain offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_47\">Indian\nPenal Code</a>, 1860 (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_48\">IPC</a>) besides some offences under special laws\nsuch as <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_49\">Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/1568384/\" id=\"a_50\">Explosive Substances Act, 1908</a>, Unlawful activities (Prevention) Act,\n1967, <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_51\">Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988</a>, etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">56.

For dealing generally with the matters relating to attachment\nleading to confiscation of &quot;proceeds of crime&quot; (as defined by PMLA),\nthe statute prescribes elaborately the procedure conferring powers on\nenforcement authorities thereby established, such process beginning\nwith &quot;provisional attachment&quot;, such provisional attachment being\nsubject to &quot;confirmation&quot; by adjudicating authority (constituted under\n<a href=\"/doc/112401144/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 6</a>), the order of the adjudicating authority being amenable to\nchallenge by appeal (under <a href=\"/doc/54131328/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 26</a>) to the appellate tribunal (as\nconstituted in terms of <a href=\"/doc/81153242/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 25</a>). For such properties other than\nthose covered by reciprocal arrangement for assistance with other\nsovereign States (9th Chapter), as are tainted, the same representing\n&quot;proceeds of crime&quot; available in India, the process of attachment is to\nfollow the prescription under <a href=\"/doc/176453901/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 5</a>, this being subject to\nadjudication (and eventual confiscation) in accord with <a href=\"/doc/192781018/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 8</a>.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">Crl.

In terms of such scheme, the attachment is an\ninterim measure, eventual intendment being that in the event of it\nbeing &quot;found&quot; that the offence of money-laundering has been\ncommitted and that &quot;such property&quot; is involved or has been used for\nsuch offence to be committed, the same shall be ordered to be\n&quot;confiscated to the Central Government&quot; [<a href=\"/doc/192781018/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 8 (5)</a>].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_107\">69.     In contrast to the effect of the order of &quot;attachment&quot; which only\nentails &quot;prohibition of transfer, conversion, dispossession or\nmovement&quot; of such property, &quot;the confiscation&quot; in terms of <a href=\"/doc/192781018/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 8\n(5)</a> and (7) entails all the rights and title in such property vesting\nabsolutely in the Central Government &quot;free from all encumbrances&quot;.\nThe further provision in <a href=\"/doc/144323122/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 10</a> conferring upon the Central\nGovernment the power to take over and manage such property as has\nbeen confiscated even by disposing it of leaves no doubt that the\nvesting of the property in the government is absolute. As is clear from\nthe provisos to <a href=\"/doc/123082127/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 9</a>, the liability under the encumbrance subsists\nin favour of such third party as had acted in good faith but if the\ncreation of such encumbrance was with the objective of managing\nescape of such property from such attachment or confiscation, the law\nempowers the special court, or the adjudicating authority, to declare\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">Crl. Appeal No.143/2018 &amp; others                           Page 40 of 105</span>\n such encumbrance to be &quot;void&quot;, this also leading to confiscation of the\nproperty in favour of the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">70.     The eventual touchstone, even for the special court, dealing\nwith the offence of money-laundering (and connected offences)\nremains that the property attached, or to be confiscated, must be such\nas was &quot;involved in&quot; or &quot;used for&quot; the commission of the offence of\nmoney-laundering.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_109\">71.     The law recognizes that there may be third parties having\n&quot;legitimate interest&quot; in such property. It is for this reason that they are\nafforded opportunity to approach the adjudicating authority under\n<a href=\"/doc/192781018/\" id=\"a_107\">section 8(1)</a> or (2) and also the appellate tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/54131328/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 26</a>, as\nindeed the special court under <a href=\"/doc/192781018/\" id=\"a_109\">section 8 (6)</a>, (7) &amp; (8).

Unlike PMLA, certain other criminal laws use the expression\n&quot;forfeiture&quot; of property as one of the statutorily permitted sanctions.\nThe expression &quot;confiscation&quot; has been held to have similar meaning\nand effect as the word &quot;forfeiture&quot;. For clarity in this regard, the\nfollowing observations of the Supreme Court in Gunwant Lal\nGodawat vs. Union of India and Anr., (2018) 12 SCC 309 should\nsuffice :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">                 &quot;39. The expression &quot;confiscation&quot; is not defined\n                in the Rules. It had roots in the Latin word\n                Confiscare - to consign to fiscus i.e. transfer to\n                treasury, as a punishment or in enforcement of law.\n                Though, the expression is generally understood as\n                having implications associated with a crime....

Some argument was raised to urge that the process of\nattachment (for confiscation) under PMLA is in the nature of\npunishment for an offence and so cannot precede determination of\nguilt or adjudication of value of proceeds of crime by the court.

Though in <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_144\">IPC</a>, as initially enforced, a number of\noffences attracted such punishment, prescription of this nature in some\nof them (e.g. <a href=\"/doc/786750/\" id=\"a_145\">Sections 121</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/1661760/\" id=\"a_146\">122</a> IPC) having since been omitted, a\nfew (e.g. <a href=\"/doc/786873/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 126</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/186208/\" id=\"a_148\">127</a> IPC) still retain forfeiture of property as\none of the possible punishments, this giving it a flavour of criminal\nsanction. Interestingly, the act of unlawful purchase of, or bidding for,\nproperty by a public servant, under certain circumstances, is not only\npunishable offence under <a href=\"/doc/477003/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 169</a> IPC but also entails such\nproperty, if purchased, to be &quot;confiscated&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">83.

In case the criminal court has reasons to believe that a\nperson against whom warrant (of arrest) issued by it has &quot;absconded&quot;\nor is concealing himself, subject to certain other conditions being\nfulfilled, it may while issuing, or following the issuance of,\nproclamation (under Section 82 Cr. PC) requiring his appearance,\nproceed to order &quot;attachment&quot; of property (movable or immovable) of\nsuch person by issuance of a warrant under Section 83 Cr. PC\n(corresponding to Section 88 of the old Cr. PC). Pertinent to note the\nobjective of such attachment (under Section 83 Cr. PC) being to\ncompel appearance, the attachment is lifted and the property released\nin the event of appearance within the period specified in law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_122\">84.     Conversely, in the event of continued default beyond the\nspecified period, the property is placed by the criminal court &quot;at the\ndisposal of the State Government&quot;, though the right for its disposal\n(except in case the property is subject to speedy and natural decay) is\ndeferred for a period of six months. Meanwhile, a third party claiming\ninterest may approach the criminal court by objections that his\n&quot;interest&quot; in the property is &quot;not liable to attachment&quot;, such objection\nrequiring inquiry and adjudication (<a href=\"/doc/1459204/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 84</a> Cr.PC).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">85.     The absconder, in any case, must come up &quot;within two years\nfrom the date of the attachment&quot; to claim restoration of the property or\nnet proceeds of its sale, or residue thereof, by showing and proving to\nthe satisfaction of the criminal court that he had not absconded to\nevade the process.

In these provisions under the\ngeneral law, however, the core issue that the court is to inquire into is\nthe connection, if any, between the absconder and the property.

The definition of the expression &quot;illegally acquired\nproperty&quot; under SAFEMA required a clear &quot;nexus&quot; between the\nprohibited activities and acquisition of such asset as indeed the means\n(including the consideration paid) employed in that regard and, in the\nevent of the third party being the holder, carved out an exception if he\nhad acquired it &quot;in good faith&quot; and &quot;for adequate consideration&quot;, the\nonus to prove such elements obviously being on him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">89.     The case of Biswanath Bhattacharya (supra) arose out of\nSAFEMA.

In the present context, particularly under PMLA regime, the\nconfiscation of property (which is akin to forfeiture of property) is\ndefinitely not envisaged as a criminal sanction, this for the reason that\nthe objective of the legislature clearly is to deprive the offender (of\nmoney-laundering) the enjoyment of &quot;illegally acquired&quot; fruits of\ncrime by taking away his right over property thereby acquired, it\naffecting his civil rights. All the more so, because the jurisdiction to\norder attachment of the property is vested in the executive and its\nconfirmation is left to decision of the quasi-judicial body i.e.\nadjudicating authority.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_132\">92.     The statutory authorities vested with the jurisdiction to\nprovisionally direct or confirm attachment are, however, expected to\nassess, even if tentatively, the value of proceeds of crime so that it is\nensured that only proceeds or assets of the offender of money-\nlaundering of equivalent value are subjected to restraint, the evaluation\nundoubtedly open to variation or modification in light of evidence\ngathered till the probe is concluded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_133\">93.     The      provision         for   &quot;provisional   attachment&quot;   and     its\nconfirmation, pending trial before court (wherein the issue of\nconfiscation would come up at the time of determination of guilt in\ncriminal case), is similar to the one for &quot;attachment before judgment&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1818703\" id=\"span_61\">in civil law. The law conceives of possibility of disposal of ill-gotten\nassets to &quot;frustrate&quot; the objective. The argument to the contrary is\nthus repelled.

As noted earlier, the expression &quot;confiscation&quot; is to\nbe construed similarly as &quot;forfeiture&quot;. By the provision contained in\n<a href=\"/doc/182384119/\" id=\"a_188\">Section 27</a>, a property found to be held &quot;benami&quot; may be confiscated\nby the adjudicating authority, subject to remedy of appeal before the\nappellate tribunal.

The action is initiated\non the basis of &quot;reason to believe&quot; that the holder of the property is a\n&quot;benamidar&quot; which expression is defined by <a href=\"/doc/93577912/\" id=\"a_190\">Section 2 (10)</a> to mean &quot;a\nperson or a fictitious person, as the case may be, in whose name the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">Crl.

The &quot;benami property&quot; means, as per <a href=\"/doc/93577912/\" id=\"a_191\">Section 2(8)</a>, a\nproperty which is &quot;the subject matter of a benami transaction&quot; and\nalso includes the proceeds from such property.         The expression\n&quot;benami transaction&quot; is defined by <a href=\"/doc/93577912/\" id=\"a_192\">Section 2(9)</a> to connote a\ntransaction or an arrangement where the property is transferred to or\nheld by one person while the consideration for the same is provided or\npaid by another, it being held for the &quot;immediate or future benefit&quot; of\nthe latter, this being subject to some exceptions with which one is not\nimmediately concerned here.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">99.     Ordinarily, the disputes relating to attachment or confiscation\nunder the law relating to benami property come up before the courts\ninvolving the parties in whose name the property is acquired on one\nhand and those claiming to have paid the consideration for such\nacquisition on the other. But, particularly in the context of attachment\nand confiscation, the disputes might also involve a transferee, for\nconsideration, of property suspected to be held benami in the name of\ntransferor. Such transferee is given (by <a href=\"/doc/182384119/\" id=\"a_193\">Section 27</a>) the right to object\nto confiscation, it being incumbent on him to prove that the property\nhad been held or acquired by him from the transferor (benamidar)\n&quot;without his having knowledge of the benami transaction&quot;. The test,\nthus, is of the transaction being bonafide and for &quot;adequate\nconsideration&quot;. The taint of benami in such disputes would generally\nprecede the acquisition by the bonafide holder.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">Crl.

In contrast to the above mentioned earlier legislations, the\n<a href=\"/doc/184963494/\" id=\"a_194\">Fugitive Economic Offenders Act</a> is of recent origin, it having come\ninto force with effect from 21.04.2018.                     The objective of this\nlegislation is &quot;to provide for measures to deter economic offenders\nfrom evading the process of law in India&quot;, which is similar to one of\nexisting general law of proclamation and attachment under Sections\n82-83 Cr. PC, the idea being to compel appearance. As in PMLA, this\nlaw,    however,        also       focuses   on   certain     specified   economic\n(&quot;scheduled&quot;) offences (as included in the schedule), the value\ninvolved wherein exceeds the minimum threshold (Rs.100 Crore), the\nfocus of attachment leading to confiscation, upon declaration of a\nperson as &quot;fugitive economic offender&quot; being on the &quot;proceeds of\ncrime&quot;. The definition of the expression &quot;proceeds of crime&quot; under\nthis law is similar to that of identical clause in PMLA. A person is\ndeclared fugitive economic offender if the special court finds that a\nwarrant for his arrest in relation to a scheduled offence having been\nissued by any court in India he &quot;has left India so as to avoid criminal\nprosecution&quot; or being abroad &quot;refuses to return&quot; to India &quot;to face\ncriminal prosecution&quot;.             The property which can be attached and\nconfiscated under this law would be the one acquired by                           the\n&quot;proceeds of crime&quot; or the value thereof, it including benami property\nheld in India or abroad, even if such property were to be not &quot;owned\nby the fugitive economic offender&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_141\">101. <a href=\"/doc/195568066/\" id=\"a_195\">Section 5 (4)</a> protects the continuation of enjoyment of the\nimmovable property by a &quot;person interested&quot; if he had a claim or title\nto &quot;any interest in the property&quot;.

Generally speaking, the civil sanction of forfeiture (for\nconfiscation) of property is thus directed by all the above-mentioned\nenactments against property with which there is a link or nexus of the\ncriminal offence. A bonafide holder of such property is protected but\nthe onus to displace the inference arising from the evidence available\nby proving that his acquisition was legitimate and for adequate\nconsideration is on him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\">               PROCEEDS OF CRIME : TARGETTED ASSET(S)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_144\">103. The         special legislation against money-laundering (PMLA)\nseeks to enforce the sanction of confiscation (initiated by attachment)\nagainst ill-gotten assets expecting to ensnare them in a net wider than\nunder most of the existing laws germane to the issue of economic\nwell-being, security and integrity of India as a sovereign State. The\nexpansive definition of the targeted property, described as &quot;proceeds\nof crime&quot;, as given in <a href=\"/doc/168773879/\" id=\"a_197\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> is as under :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">        &quot;proceeds of crime&quot; means any property derived or\n        obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result\n        of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence or the\n        value of any such property or where such property is\n        taken or held outside the country, then the property\n        equivalent in value held within the country or abroad;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">Crl.

The above definition may be deconstructed into three parts :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">        (i).    property derived or obtained (directly or indirectly) as\n        a result of criminal activity relating to scheduled offence; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">        (ii). the value of any such property as above; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">        (iii). if the property of the nature first above mentioned has\n        been &quot;taken or held&quot; abroad, any other property &quot;equivalent\n        in value&quot; whether held in India or abroad.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_146\">105. It is vivid that the legislature has made provision for\n&quot;provisional attachment&quot; bearing in mind the possibility of\ncircumstances of urgency that might necessitate such power to be\nresorted to. A person engaged in criminal activity intending to convert\nthe proceeds of crime into assets that can be projected as legitimate (or\nuntainted) would generally be in a hurry to render the same\nunavailable. The entire contours of the crime may not be known when\nit comes to light and the enforcement authority embarks upon a probe.\nThe crime of such nature is generally executed in stealth and secrecy,\nmultiple transactions (seemingly legitimate) creating a web lifting the\nveil whereof is not an easy task. The truth of the matter is expected to\nbe uncovered by a detailed probe which may take long time to\nundertake and conclude. The total wrongful gain from the criminal\nactivity cannot be computed till the investigation is completed. The\nauthority for &quot;provisional&quot; attachment of suspect assets is to ensure\nthat the same remain within the reach of the law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_147\">106.

Appeal No.143/2018 &amp; others                             Page 60 of 105</span>\n &quot;tainted property&quot; in as much as there would assumably be evidence\nto prima facie show that the source of (or consideration for) its\nacquisition is the product of specified crime, the essence of &quot;money-\nlaundering&quot; being its projection as &quot;untainted property&quot; (<a href=\"/doc/145523748/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 3</a>).\nThis would include such property as may have been obtained or\nacquired by using the tainted property as the consideration (directly or\nindirectly). To illustrate, bribe or illegal gratification received by a\npublic servant in form of money (cash) being undue advantage and\ndishonestly gained, is tainted property acquired &quot;directly&quot; by a\nscheduled offence and consequently &quot;proceeds of crime&quot;. Any other\nproperty acquired using such bribe as consideration is also &quot;proceeds\nof crime&quot;, it having been obtained &quot;indirectly&quot; from a prohibited\ncriminal activity within the meaning of first limb of the definition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_148\">107. In contrast, the second and third kinds of properties mentioned\nabove would ordinarily be &quot;untainted property&quot; that may have been\nacquired by the suspect legitimately without any connection with\ncriminal activity or its result. The same, however, are intended to fall\nin the net because their owner is involved in the proscribed criminality\nand the tainted assets held by him are not traceable, or cannot be\nreached, or those found are not sufficient to fully account for the\npecuniary advantage thereby gained. This is why for such untainted\nproperties (held in India or abroad) to be taken away, the rider put by\nlaw insists on equivalence in value.       From this perspective, it is\nessential that, before the order of attachment is confirmed, there must\nbe some assessment (even if tentative one) as to the value of wrongful\ngain made by the specified criminal activity unless it be not possible to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">Crl. Appeal No.143/2018 &amp; others                            Page 61 of 105</span>\n do so by such stage, given the peculiar features or complexities of the\ncase. The confiscation to be eventually ordered, however, must be\nrestricted to the value of illicit gains from the crime. For the sake of\nconvenience, the properties covered by the second and third categories\nmay be referred to as &quot;the alternative attachable property&quot; or &quot;deemed\ntainted property&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_149\">108. Generally, there would be no difficulty in proceeding with the\nattachment or confiscation of a tainted property respecting which there\nis material available to show that the same was derived or obtained as\na result of criminal activity of specified nature, so long as such\nproperty is found held by the person who had indulged in such\ncriminal activity, it amounting to money-laundering, as indeed those\nwho may have aided or abetted such acts. Dispute, however, is likely\nto arise in relation to attachment or confiscation upon questions being\nraised at the instance of the person suspected of money-laundering (or\nhis abettor) as to sufficiency of the material or reasons to believe for\nsuch action, as indeed of the fairness or propriety of the procedure\nfollowed. Dispute may also arise in such context if the property has\nbeen transferred to another person, after it had been acquired by the\ntransaction relatable to money-laundering and before its attachment\nunder PMLA. The third party may have a claim to agitate that it had\nbeen acquired by it bonafide and for lawful and adequate\nconsideration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_150\">109. The inclusive definition of &quot;proceeds of crime&quot; respecting\nproperty of the second above-mentioned nature - i.e. &quot;the value of any\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">Crl. Appeal No.143/2018 &amp; others                          Page 62 of 105</span>\n such property&quot; - gives rise (as it has done so in these five appeals) to\npotential multi-layered conflicts between the person suspected of\nmoney-laundering (the accused), a third party (with whom such\naccused may have entered into some transaction vis-a-vis the property\nin question) and the enforcement authority (the State).         Since the\nsecond of the above species of &quot;proceeds of crime&quot; uses the expression\n&quot;such property&quot;, the qualifying word being &quot;such&quot;, it is vivid that the\n&quot;property&quot; referred to here is equivalent to the one indicated by the\nfirst kind. The only difference is that it is not the same property as of\nthe first kind, it having been picked up from among other properties of\nthe accused, the intent of the legislature being that it must be of the\nsame &quot;value&quot; as the former. The third kind does use the qualifying\nwords &quot;equivalent in value&quot;. Though these words are not used in the\nsecond category, it is clear that the said kind also has to be understood\nin the same sense.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">110. Thus, it must be observed that, in the opinion of this court, if the\nenforcement authority under PMLA has not been able to trace the\n&quot;tainted property&quot; which was acquired or obtained by criminal\nactivity relating to the scheduled offence for money-laundering, it can\nlegitimately proceed to attach some other property of the accused, by\ntapping the second (or third) above-mentioned kind provided that it is\nof value near or equivalent to the proceeds of crime. But, for this to\nbe a fair exercise, the empowered enforcement officer must assess\n(even if tentatively), and re-evaluate, as the investigation into the case\nprogresses, the quantum of &quot;proceeds of crime&quot; derived or obtained\nfrom the criminal activity so that proceeds or other assets of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">Crl. Appeal No.143/2018 &amp; others                            Page 63 of 105</span>\n equivalent value of the offender of money-laundering (or his abettor)\nare subjected to attachment to such extent, the eventual order of\nconfiscation being always restricted to take over by the Government of\nillicit gains of crime, the burden of proving facts to the contrary being\non the person who so contends.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_152\">111. If such other property as above (the alternative attachable\nproperty or deemed tainted property) is owned by, or held in the name\nof, the accused, objections to attachment (or confiscation) would\ngenerally concern the material on which reasons to believe about\nmoney-laundering and acquisition of proceeds of crime are founded or\nthe value of the property which has been attached.           Again, the\npossibility of conflict involving interest of a third party comes in for\nwhich the bonafides of the acts through which such third party may\nhave acquired interest in the targeted property, as indeed of the\nlawfulness and adequacy of consideration for such acquisition, would\nneed scrutiny.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\">   THE ARGUMENT OF PREVALENCE OF CERTAIN LAWS\n (RDBA, SARFAESI ACT &amp; INSOLVENCY CODE) OVER PMLA\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_154\">112.

It is the view of the appellate tribunal that the insertion of\nSection 31-B to RDBA and <a href=\"/doc/104779555/\" id=\"a_242\">Section 26-E</a> to <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_243\">SARFAESI Act</a> by the\namendment of 2016 renders the said laws to have an overriding effect\nover PMLA. Though the issue raised by the Resolution Professional\n(RP) in the fourth captioned appeal with reference to the Insolvency\nCode was not urged before the appellate tribunal, similar argument is\npressed to seek primacy for the Insolvency Code over PMLA on\naccount of Section 238 of the former.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_176\">129. At the hearing, however, it was noted that some of the\namendments made to the SARFEAESI Act by second chapter of Act\nNo.44 of 2016 are yet to come into force and this includes the chapter\n(no.IV-A) on the subject of &quot;registration by secured creditors and\nother creditors&quot;. <a href=\"/doc/104779555/\" id=\"a_244\">Section 26-E</a> (priority to secured creditors) with\nreference, inter alia, to which the aforementioned view has been taken\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">Crl.

IV-A) by virtue of\n<a href=\"/doc/11945171/\" id=\"a_245\">Section 18</a> of the Act No.44 of 2016. Strictly speaking, therefore, a\nview to the effect taken by the tribunal by reference to <a href=\"/doc/104779555/\" id=\"a_246\">Section 26-E</a>\n(which is yet to come into effect) was impermissible. Be that as it\nmay, since the said Chapter (no.IV-A) has been inserted in\nSARFEAESI Act by the legislature, and is likely to come into force in\nfuture, its effect on the issues being addressed in these matters may be\nconsidered also on the assumption that it is part of the law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_177\">130. For comprehensive understanding of the subject, before\nproceeding further, it may be noted here that the existing provisions in\nSARFEAESI Act, particularly the Chapter (no. IV) captioned\n&quot;Central Registry&quot; envisage, inter alia, &quot;registration of ... creation of\nsecurity interest&quot; (as indeed of its modification), through a central\nregistry established under <a href=\"/doc/187948024/\" id=\"a_247\">Section 20</a> by the Central Government, its\ndatabase required to be integrated with other registration systems by\nvirtue of <a href=\"/doc/20004756/\" id=\"a_248\">Section 20-A</a>, the mandate in terms of notification issued\nunder proviso to <a href=\"/doc/49791631/\" id=\"a_249\">Section 23(1)</a> for all such transactions to be\ncompulsorily registered within the period specified. It may be added\nhere that the Securitisation and Reconstruction of Financial Assets and\nEnforcement of Securities Interest (Central Registry) Rule, 2011\npublished in the Gazette of India on 31.03.2011 govern the procedure\nand the timelines for such registration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_178\">131. The Chapter (no.

As and when the said Chapter (no.

In each case, the amount to be recovered is &quot;due&quot; to the\nclaimant i.e. the banks or the financial institutions or the secured\ncreditor, as the case may be, the claim being against the debtor (or his\nguarantor).      The Insolvency Code, in contrast, seeks to primarily\nprotect the interest of creditors by entrusting them with the\nresponsibility to seek resolution through a professional (RP), failure\non his part leading eventually to the liquidation process.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_187\">140.

In view of the conclusions reached as above, rejecting the\nargument of prevalence of RDBA, SARFAESI Act and Insolvency\nCode over PMLA, the said laws (or similar other laws, some <a href=\"/doc/26280691/\" id=\"a_285\">referred\nto above</a>) must co-exist, each to be construed and enforced in\nharmony, without one being in derogation of the other, with regard to\nassets respecting which there is material available to show the same to\nhave been &quot;derived or obtained&quot; as a result of &quot;criminal activity\nrelating to a scheduled offence&quot; rendering the same &quot;proceeds of\ncrime&quot;, within the mischief of PMLA. The PMLA, declares, by virtue\nof Section 71, that it has over-riding effect over other existing laws,\nsuch provision containing non-obstante clause with regard to\ninconsistency apparently to be construed as referable to the dealings in\n&quot;money-laundering&quot; and &quot;proceeds of crime&quot; relating thereto.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_197\">149. An order of attachment under PMLA, if it meets with the\nstatutory pre-requisites, is as lawful as an action initiated by a bank or\nfinancial institution, or a secured creditor, for recovery of dues\nlegitimately claimed or for enforcement of secured interest in\naccordance with RDBA or <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_286\">SARFAESI Act</a>. An order of attachment\nunder PMLA is not rendered illegal only because a secured creditor\nhas a prior secured interest (charge) in the subject property.\nConversely, mere issuance of an order of attachment under PMLA\ncannot, by itself, render illegal the prior charge or encumbrance of a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">Crl.

In these conflicting claims, a balance has to\nbe struck. On account of exercise of the prerogative of the State under\nPMLA, the lawful interest of a third party which may have acted\nbonafide, and with due diligence, cannot be put in jeopardy. The\nclaim of bonafide third party claimant cannot be sacrificed or\ndefeated.       A contrary view would be unfair and unjust and,\nconsequently, not the intention of the legislature.     The legislative\nscheme itself justifies this view. To illustrate, reference may be made\nto    sub-section (8) of <a href=\"/doc/192781018/\" id=\"a_287\">Section 8</a> PMLA where-under a power is\nconferred on the special court to direct the Central Government to\n&quot;restore&quot; a property to the claimant with a legitimate interest even\nafter an order of confiscation has been passed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_198\">150. The legislation on money-laundering, as is the case of similarly\nplaced other legislations providing for forfeiture or confiscation of\nillegally acquired assets, contains sufficient safeguards to protect the\ninterest of such third parties as may have acted bonafide.          Such\nsafeguards and rights to secure their lawful interest in the property\nsubjected to attachment (with intent to take it to confiscation) have\nalready been noticed at length with reference to the statutory\nprovisions. To recapitulate, and by way of illustration, reference may\nbe made to the opportunity afforded by law (<a href=\"/doc/192781018/\" id=\"a_288\">Section 8</a>) to a person\nclaiming &quot;a legitimate interest&quot; to approach the adjudicating authority\nand the appellate tribunal, as indeed the court, to prove that he had\n&quot;acted in good faith&quot;, taking &quot;all reasonable precautions&quot;, himself not\nbeing involved in money-laundering, to seek its &quot;release&quot; or\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">Crl.

In this context, however, as also earlier noted, the\npresumptions that can be drawn in terms of <a href=\"/doc/49791631/\" id=\"a_289\">Sections 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/41629693/\" id=\"a_290\">24</a> of\nPMLA are to be borne in mind, the burden of proving facts contrary to\nthe case of money-laundering being on the person claiming to have\nacted bonafide.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_199\">151.

If there is no\n                direct / indirect involvement of any person or\n                property with the proceeds of the crime nor there is\n                any aspect of knowledge in any person with respect\n                to involvement or assistance nor the said person is\n                party to the said transaction, then it cannot be said\n                that the said person is connected with any activity\n                or process with the proceeds of the crime. The\n                same principle should be applied while judging the\n                involvement of any property or any person in\n                money laundering. This is due to the reason that if\n                the property has no direct involvement in the\n                proceeds of the crime and has passed on hands to\n                the number of purchasers which includes the bona\n                fide purchaser without notice, the said purchaser\n                who is not having any knowledge about the\n                involvement of the said property with the proceeds\n                of the crime nor being the participants in the said\n                transaction ever, cannot be penalized for no fault\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">Crl.

In case such property is held\nby the person who is &quot;charged with the offence of money-laundering&quot;,\nthere is a statutory presumption under <a href=\"/doc/41629693/\" id=\"a_315\">Section 24(a)</a> PMLA, using the\nexpression &quot;shall presume&quot;, about it being proceeds of crime involved\nin such money-laundering. It is a rebuttable presumption, the onus to\nprove facts to the contrary being on the person accused of such\noffence. If the acquisition of such property by such accused has\ninvolved more than one &quot;inter-connected transactions&quot;, one of such\ntransactions being proved to be involving money-laundering, a\nstatutory presumption is raised under <a href=\"/doc/49791631/\" id=\"a_316\">Section 23</a> PMLA that the other\ntransactions form part of the former, the burden to prove facts to the\ncontrary being again on the person claiming otherwise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_208\">160. But, in cases where the enforcement authority seeks to attach\nother properties, suspecting them to be &quot;proceeds of crime&quot;, not on the\nbasis of fact that they are actually &quot;derived or obtained&quot; from criminal\nactivity but because they are of equivalent &quot;value&quot; as to the proceeds\nof crime which cannot be traced, it is essential that there be some\nnexus or link between such property on one hand and the person\naccused of or charged with the offence of money-laundering on the\nother. In cases of this nature, the person accused of money-laundering\nmust have had an interest in such property at least till the time of\nengagement in the proscribed criminal activity from which he is stated\nto have derived or obtained pecuniary benefit which is to be taken\naway by attachment or confiscation. It is with this view that PMLA\nprovides for a possible presumption to be drawn, under <a href=\"/doc/41629693/\" id=\"a_317\">Section 24(b)</a>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">Crl. Appeal No.143/2018 &amp; others                            Page 92 of 105</span>\n using the expression &quot;may presume&quot;, about a property being &quot;involved\nin money-laundering&quot; in the case of person other than the one who is\ncharged with the offence of money-laundering. There is no doubt that\nsuch presumption, if drawn, may also be rebutted by evidence\nshowing facts to the contrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_209\">161. The law conceives of possibility of third party interest in\nproperty of a person accused of money-laundering being created\nlegitimately or, conversely, with ulterior motive &quot;to frustrate&quot; or &quot;to\ndefeat&quot; the objective of law against money-laundering. In case of\ntainted asset - that is to say a property acquired or obtained as a result\nof criminal activity - the interest acquired by a third party from person\naccused of money-laundering, even if bona fide, for lawful and\nadequate consideration, cannot result in the same being released from\nattachment, or escaping confiscation, since the law intends it to &quot;vest\nabsolutely in the Central Government free from all encumbrances&quot;,\nthe right of such third party being restricted to sue the wrong-doer for\ndamages, the encumbrance, if created with the objective of defeating\nthe law, being treated as void (<a href=\"/doc/123082127/\" id=\"a_318\">Section 9</a>).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_210\">162. But, in case an otherwise untainted asset (i.e. deemed tainted\nproperty) is targeted by the enforcement authority for attachment\nunder the second or third part of the definition of &quot;proceeds of crime&quot;,\nfor the reason that such asset is equivalent in value to the tainted asset\nthat was derived or obtained by criminal activity but which cannot be\ntraced, the third party having a legitimate interest may approach the\nadjudicating authority to seek its release by showing that the interest\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">Crl. Appeal No.143/2018 &amp; others                            Page 93 of 105</span>\n in such property was acquired bona fide and for lawful (and adequate)\nconsideration, there being no intent, while acquiring such interest or\ncharge, to defeat or frustrate the law, neither the said property nor the\nperson claiming such interest having any connection with or being\nprivy to the offence of money-laundering.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_211\">163. Having regard to the above scheme of the law in PMLA, it is\nclear that if a bonafide third party claimant had acquired interest in the\nproperty which is being subjected to attachment at a time anterior to\nthe commission of the criminal activity, the product whereof is\nsuspected as proceeds of crime, the acquisition of such interest in such\nproperty (otherwise assumably untainted) by such third party cannot\nconceivably be on account of intent to defeat or frustrate this law. In\nthis view, it can be concluded that the date or period of the\ncommission of criminal activity which is the basis of such action\nunder PMLA can be safely treated as the cut-off.           From this, it\nnaturally follows that an interest in the property of an accused, vesting\nin a third party acting bona fide, for lawful and adequate\nconsideration, acquired prior to the commission of the proscribed\noffence evincing illicit pecuniary benefit to the former, cannot be\ndefeated or frustrated by attachment of such property to such extent by\nthe enforcement authority in exercise of its power under <a href=\"/doc/192781018/\" id=\"a_319\">Section 8</a>\nPMLA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_212\">164. Though the sequitur to the above conclusion is that the bonafide\nthird party claimant has a legitimate right to proceed ahead with\nenforcement of its claim in accordance with law, notwithstanding the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">Crl. Appeal No.143/2018 &amp; others                            Page 94 of 105</span>\n order of attachment under PMLA, the latter action is not rendered\nirrelevant or unenforceable. To put it clearly, in such situations as\nabove (third party interest being prior to criminal activity) the order of\nattachment under PMLA would remain valid and operative, even\nthough the charge or encumbrance of such third party subsists but the\nState action would be restricted to such part of the value of the\nproperty as exceeds the claim of the third party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_213\">165. Situation may also arise, as seems to be the factual matrix of\nsome of the cases at hand, wherein a secured creditor, it being a\nbonafide third party claimant      vis-a-vis the alternative attachable\nproperty (or deemed tainted property) has initiated action in\naccordance with law for enforcement of such interest prior to the order\nof attachment under PMLA, the initiation of the latter action\nunwittingly having the effect of frustrating the former. Since both\nactions are in accord with law, in order to co-exist and be in harmony\nwith each other, following the preceding prescription, it would be\nappropriate that the PMLA attachment, though remaining valid and\noperative, takes a back-seat allowing the secured creditor bonafide\nthird party claimant to enforce its claim by disposal of the subject\nproperty, the remainder of its value, if any, thereafter to be made\navailable for purposes of PMLA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_214\">166. As already noted, the newly inserted provision contained in\n<a href=\"/doc/105272785/\" id=\"a_320\">Sections 26-B</a> to <a href=\"/doc/104779555/\" id=\"a_321\">26-E</a> falling in Chapter (no.

Appeal No.143/2018 &amp; others                            Page 95 of 105</span>\n clauses coming into force, a creditor will not be entitled to exercise the\nright of enforcement, inter alia, of security interest over the property\nof borrower unless such &quot;security interest&quot; has been duly registered\nunder the said law. Upon such amended law being enforced, a bona\nfide third party claimant seeking relief against an order of attachment\nunder PMLA will also be obliged to show due compliance with such\nstatutory requirements.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_215\">167. As has been highlighted earlier, the provisional order of\nattachment is subject to confirmation by the adjudicating authority.\nThe order of the adjudicating authority, in turn, is amenable to appeal\nto the appellate tribunal. The said forum (i.e. the appellate tribunal)\nmay pass such orders as it thinks fit &quot;confirming, modifying or setting\naside the order appealed against&quot; [<a href=\"/doc/54131328/\" id=\"a_322\">Section 26(4)</a>]. Undoubtedly, an\naggrieved party is entitled in law to invoke the said jurisdiction of the\nappellate tribunal to bring a challenge to the orders of attachment (as\nconfirmed) but, the law in PMLA, at the same time, also confers\njurisdiction on the special court to entertain such claim for purposes of\nrestoration of the property during the trial of the case [<a href=\"/doc/192781018/\" id=\"a_323\">Section 8</a>]. The\njurisdiction to entertain objections to attachment conferred on the\nappellate tribunal on one hand and, on the special court, on the other,\nthus, may be co-ordinate, to an extent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_216\">168. An argument, however, was raised, by the appellants that the\nrespondents herein should have approached the special court, instead\nof the appellate tribunal, for consideration of their respective claims.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">Crl.

In view of above-noted legislative scheme, it must be clarified\nthat if the order confirming the attachment has attained finality, or if\nthe order of confiscation has been passed or, further if the trial of a\ncase for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/20781376/\" id=\"a_324\">Section 4</a> PMLA has commenced, the claim\nof a party asserting to have acted bonafide or having legitimate\ninterest will have to be inquired into and adjudicated upon only by the\nspecial court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_218\">170.     But, the above exception cannot be applied to all cases of bona\nfide third party claimants so as to confer a general right to seek release\nof such property as last mentioned above from attachment even in\ncases where the encumbrance is created or interest acquired at a time\naround or after the date or period of criminal activity.

The charge or encumbrance of a third party in a\n        property attached under PMLA cannot be treated or\n        declared as &quot;void&quot; unless material is available to show that\n        it was created &quot;to defeat&quot; the said law, such declaration\n        rendering such property available for attachment and\n        confiscation under PMLA, free from such encumbrance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_227\">        (xi).

An order of attachment under PMLA is not illegal\n        only because a secured creditor has a prior secured interest\n        (charge) in the property, within the meaning of the\n        expressions used in RDBA and SARFAESI Act. Similarly,\n        mere issuance of an order of attachment under PMLA does\n        not ipso facto render illegal a prior charge or encumbrance\n        of a secured creditor, the claim of the latter for release (or\n        restoration) from PMLA attachment being dependent on its\n        bonafides.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_229\">        (xiii).

In view of the above conclusions, the impugned decisions of the\nappellate tribunal will have to be set aside. There is a need for further\nscrutiny particularly on facts, of the claims of the respondents, in their\nappeals which were presented before the said forum to challenge the\norders of attachment, as confirmed by the adjudicating authority in the\nfive cases.

But, they are sought\nto be attached and subjected to eventual confiscation on account of\nthey being the alternative attachable properties or deemed tainted\nproperties, which is permissible in law. The audi car (subject matter\nof first appeal) was acquired by a transaction which has no direct\nconnection with the case of money-laundering. However, there is no\nclarity as to the value of proceeds of crime which are to be confiscated\nas against value of the attached property as indeed the extent of the\ndebt yet to be recovered by the secured creditor. The monetary gains\nmade by the transactions which are subject matter of the accusations\nof money-laundering on account of illicit foreign exchange\ntransactions (third appeal) or the case of cheating by use of fabricated\ndefence supply orders (fourth appeal), both involving public servants,\nrequire closer scrutiny as to the claim of the respondent banks of\nbonafide action. Though there is no such element of complicity on\npart of any of the officials of the respondent banks in the case relating\nto fictitious hospital equipment (second appeal) or the one involving\nconsortium of banks (fifth appeal), scrutiny respecting legitimacy and\nbonafide of the claim on the touchstone, inter alia, of the subsisting\nvalue of the secured interest and chronology of events leading to\nattachment would be necessary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_237\">174.
