Alcohol has already proved itself to be one of the \n\n\nmajor enemies of the human beings.  However, its grip is \n\n\nnot   loosened   in   spite   of   the   realization   of   the   evil \n\n\neffects   of   alcohol   on   the   human   life.     On   the   other \n\n\nhand,   the   unholy   grip   is   being   tightened   day   by   day. \n\n\nTherefore, when the standard and healthy alcohol in the \n\n\nform  of liquor  is not  available or  is too  costly for  a \n\n\ncommon   man,   the   poor   section   of   the   society   goes   for \n\n\nillicitly   distilled   liquor   which   is   sold   by   the \n\n\nbootleggers.  The conscienceless bootleggers - thanks to \n\n\ntheir   avarice   for   money   -   take   full   advantage   of   this \n\n\nhuman weakness and without any compunction or qualms of \n\n\nconscience,  distill illicit  liquor and  then to  increase \n\n\nthe   sale   and   to   gain   astronomical   profits   make   their \n\n\nproduct   more   potent   at   least   in   taste   so   as   to   attract \n\n\nthe   poor   customers.     Such   poor   customers   invariably \n\n\nbecome   the   prey   of   such   unholy   avarice   on   the   part   of \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                           5</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe bootleggers and in the process even lose their lives \n\n\nat   times   or   suffer   such   injuries   which   are   irreparable \n\n\nlike total blindness etc. and that is precisely what has \n\n\nhappened in this case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">5.    On   22.10.2000,   in   the   wee   hours,  Sub-Inspector   of \n\n\nPolice,   Paripally   received   information   that   one \n\n\nRaghunatha Kurup of Kulathoorkonam and seven others were \n\n\nadmitted         in         the         Medical         College         Hospital \n\n\nThiruvananthapuram   for   treatment   on   account   of   illness \n\n\ncaused by consumption of illicit liquor.  He reached the \n\n\nHospital and recorded the first information statement of \n\n\nRaghunatha Kurup at 2 a.m.  By that time, one Sasidharan \n\n\nwho   had   consumed   the   illicit   liquor   had   died   and   two \n\n\nothers   were   lying   in   unconscious   condition.     On   that \n\n\nbasis,   Sub-Inspector   registered   Crime   No.   268   of   2000 \n\n\nunder   <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_15\">Section   302</a>,   <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_16\">307</a>,   IPC   read   with   <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_17\">Section   34</a>,   IPC \n\n\nand under <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 57A</a> of the Abkari Act.   Little did he \n\n\nknow   the   exact   ramifications   or   vastness   of   the   grim \n\n\ntragedy   which   was   about   to   take   place.     Three   other \n\n\nsimilar   crimes   were   registered   at   Kottarakkara   police \n\n\nstation   and   this   was   followed   by   further   crimes \n\n\nregistered in the same police station being Crime No.809 \n\n\nof 2000, Crime No.810 of 2000, Crime No.811 of 2000 and \n\n\nCrime   No.817   of   2000.

Similar \n\n\nincidents   had   taken   place   within   the   limits   of \n\n\nMangalapuram police station and the crime was registered \n\n\nthere   also.     Investigation   machinery   quickly   responded \n\n\nto the happenings and a special investigation team (SIT) \n\n\nwas   constituted   as   per   the   directions   of   Director \n\n\nGeneral   of   Police,   Kerala,   Thiruvananthapuram   on \n\n\n25.10.2000 which was to be headed by Shri Sibi Mathews, \n\n\nIPS who was the Inspector General of Police.   He was to \n\n\nhead the team of seven persons, six other persons being \n\n\nthe   police   officers   of   the   level   of   Inspectors   and \n\n\nabove.     All   these   earlier   mentioned   crimes   were   taken \n\n\nover   for   investigation   by   SIT.             They   started \n\n\ninvestigation in all the concerned police stations where \n\n\nthe crimes were reported.   It was realized that as many \n\n\nas   31   persons   had   lost   their   lives,   six   persons   had \n\n\nsuffered total blindness in Kollam District whereas more \n\n\nthan 500 persons suffered serious injuries on account of \n\n\nthe drinking of the illicit liquor.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                    7</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">6.    Unfortunately,   all   this   was   going   on   in   God&#x27;s   own \n\n\ncountry, Kerala which was turned into hell by the liquor \n\n\nmafia.     Eventually,   investigation   by   the   SIT   was \n\n\ncompleted   and   the   final   report   was   filed   before   the \n\n\nJudicial   Magistrate,   1st  Class,   Paravoor   on   21.1.2001 \n\n\nagainst   47   persons.

At times, this concoction \n\n\nwas   mixed   with   toddy   and   other   essences   resulting   in   a \n\n\ndrink   called  Kalapani.

His brothers, Manikantan (accused No.4) and \n\n\nVinod   Kumar   (accused   No.8)   were   deputies   helping   him. \n\n\nThis   group   had   servants   like   Balachandran   (A-15),   the \n\n\nManager.     Even   their   wives   did   not   lag   behind.     There \n\n\nwere laboratories, assistants and labourers.  There were \n\n\ndrivers   and   a   fleet   of   vehicles   which   were   used   for \n\n\nimporting methyl alcohol from Karnataka and then it used \n\n\nto be brought to the laboratories maintained by Chandran \n\n\n(A-7), Manikantan (A-4) and Vinod Kumar (A-8) where the \n\n\nmixing used to take place.

Some of the accused persons died during the \n\n\ntrial.     Those   who   were   convicted   by   the   Sessions   Judge \n\n\nwere awarded sentences depending upon the seriousness of \n\n\nthe   crime   as   per   the   classifications   which   have   been \n\n\nshown above.

The   convicted   accused   filed   appeals \n\n\nbefore   the   High   Court.     The   High   Court   also   acquitted \n\n\nfew of the accused persons and those whose appeals were \n\n\ndismissed   have   now   come   before   us   by   way   of   separate \n\n\nappeals   which   we   have   indicated   in   the   first   paragraph \n\n\nof   this   judgment.     The   High   Court   has   considered   the \n\n\nappeals   filed   by   various   accused   before   it   separately. \n\n\nWe   also   propose   to   do   the   same   thing.

A-7, \n\n\nA-4,   A-30,   A-8   and   Suresh   Kumar   (A-25)   who   filed   SLP \n\n\n(Crl)   842   of   2006.     Before   we   take   up   this   task,   we \n\n\nwould analyze the impugned judgment of the High Court.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">16.    To   begin   with,   the   High   Court,   after   quoting \n\n\nSections   8,   55,   57A   and   58   of   the   Kerala   Abkari   Act, \n\n\nproceeded   to   consider   the   entire   evidence   appeal-wise. \n\n\nIn that, the High Court appreciated the evidence of the \n\n\nindividual   witnesses   insofar   as   they   were   relevant   to \n\n\nthe particular accused whose appeal was being considered \n\n\nas also the documentary evidence as figured against that \n\n\nparticular   accused.     Therefore,   it   so   happened   that \n\n\nsometimes   the   appreciation   of   evidence   of   common \n\n\nwitnesses   is   repeated   in   the   High   Court&#x27;s   judgment   but \n\n\nconsidering the large number of witnesses, more than 276 \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                    1</span>\n\n\n\n\nin   all,   that   was   inevitable.     Still,   it   will   be   our \n\n\nendeavour  to avoid  the repetition  while considering  the \n\n\nmatter at this stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">17.    These   appeals   are   against   the   concurrent   findings \n\n\nof   fact   and,   therefore,   it   is   obvious   that   this   Court \n\n\ndoes not enter the area of re-appreciation of evidence. \n\n\nThat   can   be   done   only   in   case   the   appreciation   is \n\n\nsubstantially  defective and  the inferences  drawn by  the \n\n\nCourts   below   could   not   have   been   drawn   in   law.     This \n\n\nCourt has, time and again, declared that even where the \n\n\nCourts   have   acted   upon   inadmissible   evidence   or   have \n\n\nleft   out   of   the   consideration   some   material   piece   of \n\n\nevidence, the defence would be entitled to address this \n\n\nCourt   on   those   issues,   and   the   Court   would   proceed   to \n\n\nre-appreciate   the   evidence   and   re-examine   the   factual \n\n\nfindings   on   that   basis   alone.     We   must,   at   this \n\n\njuncture,   record   that   at   least  prima   facie  such   is   not \n\n\nthe   case   here.     On   the   other   hand,   we   find   that   the \n\n\nevidence   has   been   meticulously   appreciated   by   both   the \n\n\nTrial   and   the   appellate   Court.     We   also   found   no \n\n\ninstance   of   inadmissible   evidence   having   been   accepted \n\n\nor   some   material   evidence   having   been   ignored   by   the \n\n\nCourts   below.     The   arguments   mostly   related   to   the \n\n\ninterpretation   of   the   provisions   of   <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_21\">Abkari   Act</a>   as   also \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                      1</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe   provisions   of   the   <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_22\">Indian   Penal   Code</a>   (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_23\">IPC</a>).     The \n\n\ncommon   feature   of   the   arguments   was   that   the   Courts \n\n\nbelow  have mis-interpreted  the provisions  of <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_24\">Abkari  Act</a> \n\n\nand, more particularly, of Section 57A (1) (i) and (ii) \n\n\nas   also   Section   57A   (2)   (ii).     It   has   been   again   the \n\n\ncommon   feature   of   arguments   that   the   Courts   below   have \n\n\nerred   in   convicting   the   accused   persons   for   offences \n\n\nunder   those   Sections   as   the   essential   ingredients   of \n\n\nthose   Sections   were   not   proved   by   the   prosecution   as \n\n\nagainst   the   accused   persons.     It   will   be,   therefore, \n\n\nproper   to   first   examine   the   scope   of   Section   57A. \n\n\nHowever,   such   scope   will   have   to   be   examined   in   the \n\n\nlight   of   some   other   provisions   of   the   Act   as   also   the \n\n\nStatement of Objects and Reasons and the history of the \n\n\nLegislation.   Suffice it to say, at this juncture, that \n\n\nthe   original   nomenclature   of   the   Act   was   Cochin   Abkari \n\n\nAct,   Act   1   of   1077   and   <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_25\">Abkari   Act</a>   (Travancore)   4   of \n\n\n1073.   These acts provided for the levy of fees for the \n\n\nlicences   for   manufacture   and   sale   of   liquor   and \n\n\nintoxicating   drugs.       Three   acts   were   operating,   they \n\n\nwere Cochin Abkari Act, Travancore Abkari Act and Madras \n\n\nAbkari   Act.     Since   that   was   causing   difficulty,   an \n\n\nOrdinance   came   to   be   promulgated   on   01.05.1967.     This \n\n\nwas   replaced   by   a   Bill   and   that   is   how   <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_26\">Abkari   Act</a>   was \n\n\nborn.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                    1</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">18.    <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_27\">Section   2   (6A)</a>   of   the   Act   defines   `arrack&#x27;.     It \n\n\nmeans any potable liquor other than toddy, beer, spirits \n\n\nof   wine,   wine,   Indian   made   spirit,   foreign   liquor   and \n\n\nany medicinal preparation containing alcohol.  Section 2 \n\n\n(8)   defines   `toddy&#x27;   to   mean   fermented   or   unfermented \n\n\njuice   drawn   from   a   coconut,   palmyra,   date   or   any   other \n\n\nkind   of   palm   tree.     Section   2   (9)   speaks   about   the \n\n\n`spirits&#x27;   meaning   any   liquor   containing   alcohol   and \n\n\nobtained   by   distillation.   Sub-section   (10)   provides   the \n\n\ndefinition   of   `liquor&#x27;   which   includes   spirits   of   wine, \n\n\narrack,   spirits,   wine,   toddy,   beer   and   all   liquid \n\n\nconsisting   of   or   containing   alcohol.     Section   2(12) \n\n\ndefines country liquor which means toddy or arrack while \n\n\nSection  2(13) defines  foreign liquor  which includes  all \n\n\nliquor other than country liquor. Thus, it will be seen \n\n\nthat   `liquor&#x27;   is   the   broadest   concept   and   engulfs   all \n\n\nthe   intoxicating   drinks.   Section   6   prohibits   import   of \n\n\nliquor   or   intoxicating   drug   being   imported   without \n\n\npermission   of   the   Government   authorized   to   give \n\n\npermission   in   that   behalf.     Similarly,   Section   7 \n\n\nprohibits   the   export   of   liquor   or   intoxicating   drug. \n\n\nSection   8   is   an   important   Section   which   speaks   for   the \n\n\nprohibition   of   manufacture,   import,   export,   transport, \n\n\ntransit,   possession,   storage   and   sale   of   arrack.     The \n\n\ncontravention   of   this   Section   is   punishable   with   10 \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                    1</span>\n\n\n\n\nyears&#x27;   imprisonment   as   also   with   fine   of   not   less   than \n\n\nRs.1 lakh.   Some other provisions relate to the various \n\n\nother   prohibitions   including   the   provisions   for \n\n\nsearches.  Under Section 41A, the offence under this Act \n\n\nare   made   cognizable   and   non-bailable.     Section   55 \n\n\nonwards provides for penalties under the Act for various \n\n\noffences.     Section   55   speaks   about   the   illegal   import \n\n\nand is a general section which speaks about the effects \n\n\nof the contravention of the Act or rules or orders made \n\n\nthereunder   relating   to   the   import,   export,   manufacture \n\n\nof   liquor   tapping   of   toddy,   drawing   of   toddy   from   any \n\n\ntree, construction of any distillery, brewery, winery or \n\n\nother manufactory in which liquor is manufactured, used, \n\n\nor   possession   of   any   materials,   still,   utensils, \n\n\nimplements or apparatus etc. bottling of liquor for sale \n\n\nof   liquor   or   any   intoxicating   drug.     The   punishment \n\n\nprovided in this Section is 10 years&#x27; imprisonment with \n\n\nfine   which   shall   not   be   less   than   Rs.1   lakh,   excepting \n\n\nfor clauses (d) and (e), where punishment is of one year \n\n\nimprisonment.     This   punishment   has   been   brought   in   by \n\n\nway  of an  amendment by  Act 16  of 1997  before which  the \n\n\npunishment   was   merely   two   years   and   with   fine   of   not \n\n\nless   than   Rs.20,000/-.     There   was   a   gruesome   liquor \n\n\ntragedy   in   Earnakulam   district   in   the   year   1982 \n\n\nresulting   in   loss   of   eye-sight   and   physical   incapacity \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                    2</span>\n\n\n\n\nin   case   of   several   persons   and,   therefore,   severe \n\n\npenalties   were   provided   for   those   who   were   responsible \n\n\nfor   adulteration   of   liquor   and   its   sale.     These \n\n\npunishments were made further stringent by the Amendment \n\n\nAct   No.12   of   1995.     In   short,   the   stringency   was \n\n\nintroduced   in   order   to   check   the   sale   of   spurious \n\n\nliquor.     The   Statement   of   Objects   and   Reasons   for \n\n\nAmendment Act 21 of 1984, 12 of 1995, 4 of 1996 and 16 \n\n\nof   1997   suggest   the   reasons   why   deterrent   punishments \n\n\nwere   provided   for   the   offence   under   the   Act.     Original \n\n\nSection   57   provided   the   punishment   for   adulteration   by \n\n\nthe licenced vendor or manufacturer.   A new Section was \n\n\nadded   by   Amendment   Act   No.21   of   1984   being   Section   57A \n\n\nwhich is the most relevant section for our purpose.

A plain reading of the Section would mean that now \n\n\nthe   offence   is   not   limited   to   the   licence   holders,   but \n\n\nrefers   to   anybody   who   mixes   or   permits   to   be   mixed   any \n\n\nnoxious   substance   or   any   substance   which   is   likely   to \n\n\nendanger   human   life   with   any   liquor.     The   Section, \n\n\ntherefore,   is   extremely   general.     In   addition   to   the \n\n\nmixing or permitting to be mixed, sub-section (2) brings \n\n\nin   the   dragnet   of   the   offence,   a   person   who   omits   to \n\n\ntake reasonable precaution to prevent the mixing of any \n\n\nnoxious   substance.     It   is   significant   to   note   that   if, \n\n\nas   a   result   of   such   act   of   mixing   of   the   liquor   with \n\n\nnoxious   or   dangerous   substance   death   is   caused,   the \n\n\nextreme  penalty of  death also  is provided.  Imprisonment \n\n\nprovided   is   for   a   term   not   less   than   three   years   but \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                     2</span>\n\n\n\n\nwhich may extend to imprisonment for life as also with a \n\n\nfine of Rs.50,000/-.  Similar such penalties provided in \n\n\nsub-section   2(ii)   and   sub-section   2(iii)   are   also \n\n\nrelevant providing for residuary cases. Section 3 is the \n\n\npunishment  for possession  of any  liquor or  intoxicating \n\n\ndrug which is mixed with noxious substance or dangerous \n\n\ndrug knowing it to be so.  Sub-section (4) prohibits the \n\n\nbail and the conditions for grant thereof.   Sub-section \n\n\n(5) which is the most important section, puts the burden \n\n\nof   proving   that   the   accused   has   not   mixed   or   permitted \n\n\nto   be   mixed   or   has   not   omitted   to   take   reasonable \n\n\nprecautions   to   prevent   the   mixing,   is   on   the   accused \n\n\nhimself.   Similarly, the burden would be on the accused \n\n\nto prove that while he was in possession of such liquor \n\n\nmixed   with   noxious   or   dangerous   substance,   he   did   not \n\n\nknow   that   such   substance   was   mixed   with   such   liquor. \n\n\nSection 58 speaks for the possession of illicit liquor. \n\n\nAt   this   juncture,   we   need   not   go   to   the   other   offences \n\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_31\">Indian Penal Code</a> like murder, attempt to murder \n\n\netc.     In   this   case,   the   charge   is   predominantly   under \n\n\nSections 55 (a), (g), (h), (i) 57A and 58 of the <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_32\">Abkari \n\n\nAct</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"38264736\" id=\"span_26\">20.

However,  in  <a href=\"/doc/38264736/\" id=\"a_33\">P.N. Krishna Lal &amp;  \n\n\nOrs. v. Govt. of Kerala &amp; Anr.</a>  reported in  1995 Suppl. \n\n(2)   SCC   187,   this   Court   proceeded   to   uphold   the   same. \n\nWhile   upholding   the   constitutional   validity,   the   Court \n\n\nhas in detail explained the mode of proof by prosecution \n\n\nand   the   extent   of   burden   of   proof   which   lies   on   the \n\n\naccused.     The   challenge   which   was   made   to   the   validity \n\n\nof   the   Section   was   on   the   basis   of   the   Universal \n\n\nDeclaration of Human Rights (UDHR) and the International \n\n\nConvention   for   Civil   and   Political   Rights   (ICCPR),   to \n\n\nwhich   India   is   a   member   which   guarantee   fundamental \n\n\nfreedom   and   liberty   to   the   accused.     It   was   suggested \n\n\nthat   in   criminal   jurisprudence   it   was   settled   law   that \n\n\nit   was   on   the   prosecution   to   prove   all   the   ingredients \n\n\nof the offence with which the accused has been charged. \n\n\nIt   was   suggested   that   Sub-section   (5)   relieves   the \n\n\nprosecution   of   its   duty   to   prove   its   case   beyond \n\n\nreasonable   doubt   which   is   incumbent   under   the   Code   and \n\n\nthe   Evidence   Act   and   makes   the   accused   to   disprove   the \n\n\nprosecution   case.   Thereby,   the   substantive   provisions \n\n\nand the burden of proof not only violate the fundamental \n\n\nhuman rights but, also fundamental rights under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_34\">Articles \n\n\n20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_35\">14.</a> The provision was criticized as arbitrary, \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                   2</span>\n\n\n\n\nunjust and unfair and infringing upon the right to life \n\n\nand   unjust   procedure   violating   the   guarantee   under \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article   21</a>   also.   The   provision   was   also   criticized   as \n\n\nproviding   unconscionable   procedure.     It   was   further \n\n\nsuggested that though <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_37\">Sections 299</a> and <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_38\">300</a> of IPC make a \n\n\ndistinction between culpable homicide and murder but the \n\n\nAmendment   Act   has   done   away   with   this   salutary \n\n\ndistinction and mere death of a person by consumption of \n\n\nadulterated   arrack,   makes   the   offender   liable   for \n\n\nconviction   and   imprisonment   for   life   or   penalty   of \n\n\ndeath. It was further suggested that mere negligence in \n\n\ntaking   reasonable   precaution   to   prevent   mixing   of \n\n\nnoxious substance or any other substance with arrack or \n\n\nIndian  made foreign  liquor or  intoxicating foreign  drug \n\n\nwas   made   punishable   with   minimum   sentence   was   harsh, \n\n\nunjust   and   excessive   punishment   offending   <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_39\">Articles   14</a> \n\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_40\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.   Section 58B which \n\n\nwas   also   challenged   was   severally   criticized   as   being \n\n\nunfair   and   unjust.     It   was   further   suggested   that \n\n\npresumption envisaged in sub-section (5) of section 57-A \n\n\nper se violated the fundamental rights and the Universal \n\n\nDeclaration.     It   was   further   criticized   that   mere \n\n\npossession   of   adulterated   liquor   without   any   intent   to \n\n\nsell,   to   become   a   presumptive   evidence   to   impose \n\n\npunishment   without   the   prosecution   proving   that   the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                     2</span>\n\n\n\n\nperson in possession was not a bona fide consumer or had \n\n\nits   possession   without   animus   to   sell   for   consumption \n\n\nand   place   the   burden   on   the   accused   to   prove   his \n\n\ninnocence   is   procedure,   which   is   unjust   and   oppressive \n\n\nviolating   the   cardinal   principles   of   proof   of   crime \n\n\nbeyond   reasonable   doubt.                The   Section   was   also \n\n\ncriticized   for   the   excess   of   proportionality   for \n\n\nimposition   of   sentence.     Further   the   Section   was \n\n\ncriticized on the ground that compelling the accused to \n\n\nstate   the   facts   constituting   offence   under   Section   57A \n\n\nby   operation   of   sub-section   (5)   was   opposed   to   mandate \n\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 20 (3)</a> amounted to and compelled him to be a \n\n\nwitness   to   prove   his   innocence.</span>     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813801\" id=\"span_30\">While   commenting   on \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_42\">Article   20   (3)</a>,   this   Court   referred   to  R.C.

It   was \n\n\nobserved that Liberty must be controlled in the interest \n\n\nof   the   society   but   the   social   interest   must   never   be \n\n\noverbearing   to   justify   total   deprivation   of   individual \n\n\nliberty.     It   was   then   stated   that   liberty   would   not \n\n\nalways be an absolute licence but must arm itself within \n\n\nthe   confines   of   law,   In   other   words,   there   can   be   no \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                     2</span>\n\n\n\n\nliberty   without   social   restraint.

Coming   to   the   burden   of   proof,   the   Court   observed \n\n\nthat   though   in   civilized   criminal   jurisprudence   the \n\n\naccused   is   presumed   to   be   innocent   unless   he   is   found \n\n\nguilty   and   though   the   burden   of   proof   always   is   on   the \n\n\nprosecution to prove the offence beyond reasonable doubt \n\n\nyet the rule gets modulated with the march of time.  The \n\n\nCourt   referred   to   the   absolute   right   of   the   state   to \n\n\nregulate   production,   transport,   storage,   possession   and \n\n\nsale   of   liquor   or   intoxicating   drug   and   held   that   the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                     2</span>\n\n\n\n\naccused   did   not   have   the   absolute   right   to   business   or \n\n\ntrade   of   liquor.     The   Court   also   referred   to   the \n\n\nprohibitions   regarding   mixing   of   noxious   substance   with \n\n\nliquor   or   possession   thereof   and   further   held   that   the \n\n\nState   possessed   the   right   to   complete   control   on   all \n\n\nkinds   of   intoxicants.     The   Court   found   that   the \n\n\nregulation   of   sale   of   potable   liquor   prevents   reckless \n\n\npropensity for adulterating liquor to make easy gain at \n\n\nthe   cost   of   health   and   precious   life   of   consumer.     The \n\n\nCourt   also   noted   the   object   of   the   Amendment   Act   which \n\n\nwas   to   prevent   recurrence   of   large   scale   deaths   or \n\n\ngrievous   hurt   to   the   consumers   of   adulterated   liquor \n\n\nmixed   with   noxious   substance.     Referring   to   a   judgment \n\n\nreported as  Salabiaku v. Grance  [1988] 13 EHRR 379, the \n\n\nCourt   observed   that   the   national   legislature   would   be \n\n\nfree   to   strip   the   Trial   Court   of   any   genuine   power   of \n\n\nassessment   and   deprive   the   presumption   of   innocence   of \n\n\nits   substance,   if   the   words  &#x27;according   to   law&#x27;  were \n\n\nconstrued   exclusively   with   reference   to   domestic   law. \n\n\nIt   was   held   in   that   case   that   <a href=\"/doc/531094/\" id=\"a_44\">Article   6   (2)</a>   of   the \n\n\nUniversal   Declaration   of   Human   Rights   did   not   refer   to \n\n\npresumption   of   fact   or   of   law   provided   for   in   the \n\n\ncriminal   law   with   indifference.     It   requires   States   to \n\n\nconfine   them   within   reasonable   limits   which   take   into \n\n\naccount the importance of that is at stake and maintain \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                      2</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe   rights   of   the   defence.     Providing   exceptions   or   to \n\n\nplace partial burden on the accused was not violative of \n\n\nuniversal declaration of human rights or even Convention \n\n\non   Civil   or   Political   Rights.     The   Court   then   referred \n\n\nto   the   reported   decisions   in   UK,   Hong   Kong,   Malaysia, \n\n\nUSA, Australia and Canada to find the permissible limits \n\n\nof   burden   of   proof   of   the   accused.     The   Court   referred \n\n\nto   the   decisions   in  Woolmington   v.   Director   of   Public  \n\n\nProsecutions,  (1935)   A.C.   462;   Mancini   v.

The Court observed in para 39 as under:</span>\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1032822\" id=\"span_36\">&quot;39.It   is   the   cardinal   rule   of   our   criminal \njurisprudence that the burden in the web of proof of an \noffence   would   always   lie   upon   the   prosecution   to   prove \nall   the   facts   constituting   the   ingredients   beyond \nreasonable doubt. If there is any reasonable doubt, the \naccused   is   entitled   to   the   benefit   of   the   reasonable \ndoubt.   At   no   stage   of   the   prosecution   case,   the   burden \nto disprove the fact would rest on the defence. However, \nexceptions have been provided in <a href=\"/doc/429611/\" id=\"a_47\">sections 105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_48\">106</a> of \nthe  Evidence Act,  as stated  hereinbefore. <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_49\">Section  113-A</a> \nof the Evidence Act raises a presumption as to abatement \nof   suicide   by   a   married   woman   by   her   husband   or   his \nrelatives. Similarly section 114-A raises presumption of \nabsence of consent in a rape case. Several statutes also \nprovided   evidential   burden   on   the   accused.   On   the \ngeneral question of the burden of proof of facts within \nspecial knowledge of the accused, this Court, in <a href=\"/doc/1032822/\" id=\"a_50\">Shambu \nNath   Mehra   v.   State   of   Ajmer</a>,   [1956]   SCR   199,   laid   the \nrule thus :-</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">&quot;<a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_51\">Section   106</a>   of   the   Evidence   Act   does   not   abrogate   the \nwell-established   rule   of   criminal   law   that   except   in \nvery   exceptional   classes   of   cases   the   burden   that   lies \non   the   prosecution   to   prove   its   case   never   shifts   and \nsection   106   is   not   intended   to   relieve   the   prosecution \nof   that   burden.   On   the   contrary,   it   seeks   to   meet \ncertain   exceptional   cases   where   it   is   impossible,   or   a \nproportionately   difficult,   for   the   prosecution   to \nestablish   facts   which   are   especially   within   the \nknowledge of the accused and which can be proved by him \nwithout difficulty or inconvenience.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">The Court further observed in para 46:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">&quot;46. It is thus settled law even under general criminal \njurisprudence that <a href=\"/doc/429611/\" id=\"a_52\">sections 105</a> and <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_53\">106</a> of the Evidence \nAct  place a  part of  the burden  of proof  on the  accused \nto   prove   facts   which   are   within   his  knowledge   when   the \nprosecution   establishes   the   ingredients   of   the   offence \ncharged,   the   burden   shifts   on   to   the   accused   to   prove \ncertain   facts   within   his   knowledge   or   exceptions   to \nwhich he is entitled to. Based upon the language in the \nstatute the burden of proof varies. However, the test of \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                     3</span>\n\n\n\n\nproof  of preponderance  of probabilities  is the  extended \ncriminal jurisprudence and the burden of proof is not as \nheavy   as   on   the   prosecution.  Once   the   accused   succeeds \nin showing, by preponderance of probabilities that there \nis   reasonable   doubt   in   his   favour,   the   burden   shifts \nagain   on   to   the   prosecution   to   prove   the   case   against \nthe accused beyond reasonable doubt, if the accused has \nto   be   convicted.        From   this   conceptual   criminal \njurisprudence,   question   emerges   whether   sub-section   (5) \nplacing   the   burden   on   the   accused   of   the   facts   stated \ntherein   would   offend   <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_54\">Articles   20(3)</a><a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_55\">,   21</a>   and   <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_56\">14</a>   of   the \nConstitution.&quot;  \n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">    (emphasis supplied)\n\nFurther in paragraph 52, the Court observed and quoted:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">&quot;52.The   question   of   intention   bears   no   relevance   to   an \noffence under section 57-A and equally of culpability or \nnegligence. It is seen that mixing or permitting to mix \nnoxious substance or any other substance with liquor or \nintoxicated   drug   or   omission   to   take   reasonable \nprecaution   or   being   in   possession   without   knowledge   of \nits   adulteration   for   the   purpose   of   unjust   enrichment \nwould   be   without   any   regard   for   loss   of   precious   human \nlives   or   grievous   hurt.   The   legislature   has   noted   the \ninadequacy   and   deficiency   in   the   existing   law   to   meet \nthe   menace   of   adulteration   of   liquor   etc.   and   provided \nfor   new   offences   and   directed   with   mandatory   language \nprotection of the health and precious lives of innocent \nconsumers. While interpreting the law, the court must be \ncognizant   to   the   purpose   of   the   law   and   respect   the \nlegislative  animation and  effectuate the  law for  social \nwelfare.   The   legislature   enacted   deterrent   social \nprovisions   to   combat   the   degradation   of   human   conduct. \nThese   special   provisions   are   to   some   extent   harsh   and \nare  a departure  from normal  criminal jurisprudence.  But \nit is not uncommon in criminal statutes. It is a special \nmode   to   tackle   new   situations   created   by   human \nproclivity to amass wealth at the alter of human lives. \nSo it is not right to read down the law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">22.    Ultimately,   in   paragraph   53   the   Court   noted   the \n\n\nobject   of   the   Amendment   Act   which   was   to   put   down   the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                    3</span>\n\n\n\n\nmenace   of   adulteration   of   arrack   etc.   by   prescribing \n\n\ndeterrent sentences.  It held that the statute cannot be \n\n\nstruck   down   on   hypothesized   individual   case.     It   also \n\n\nnoted   that   under   the   Code,   the   accused   has   the \n\n\nopportunity   before   imposing   sentence   to   adduce   evidence \n\n\neven   on   sentence   and   has   an   opportunity   to   plead   any \n\n\nmitigating   circumstance   in   his   favour   and   it   would   be \n\n\nfor   the   trial   judge   to   consider   on   the   facts   situation \n\n\nin  each case  the sentence  to be  imposed.    It held  that \n\n\nall  the accused  are to  be treated  as a  class and  there \n\n\nwas reasonable nexus between the offence created and the \n\n\ncase   to   be   dealt   with,   the   procedure,   presumption   and \n\n\nburden   of   proof   placed   on   the   accused,   are   not   unjust, \n\n\nunfair or unreasonable offending <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">Articles 21</a> and <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_58\">14.</a>  It \n\n\nalso held that the provisions did not violate <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 20 \n\n\n(3)</a>   of   the   Constitution   and   thus   Sections   57A   and   57B \n\n\nwere held to be valid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">23.

Accused No.7\n\n\n\nHe   appears   to   be   the   boss   who   was   running   this   illegal \n\n\nbusiness   of   liquor   along   with   his   family   members \n\n\nincluding   accused   Nos.A-4   and   A-8   and   even   their   wives \n\n\nwere   not   left   behind   which   is   clear   from   the   fact   that \n\n\nthey were arrayed as accused along with others but could \n\n\nnot be brought to book as they were absconding and hence \n\n\ntheir   cases   were   separated.     It   appears   to   be   an \n\n\nadmitted   position   that   shop   Nos.   1   to   26   meant   for \n\n\nselling   toddy   were   being   managed   by   this   accused.     He \n\n\nhad   the   licence   for   running   those   toddy   shops   in \n\n\nChirayinkil Range.   He had obtained them in the auction \n\n\nusing his own money. The shops were obtained in the name \n\n\nof   his   wife   who   was   accused   No.18   and   also   a   relative \n\n\nbeing accused No.19.  This auction was held for the year \n\n\n2000-01,   in   March,   2000.   It   was   only   at   that   time   that \n\n\nhe   realized   that   he   had   paid   Rs.4   crores   which   may   not \n\n\nbe   possible   for   him   to   recover   if   he   sold   only   toddy \n\n\nthrough these 26 outlets.  The prosecution case is that, \n\n\ntherefore,   he   started   procuring   illicit   ethyl   alcohol \n\n\nand   for   that   purpose   accused   No.4   and   other   accused \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                     3</span>\n\n\n\n\nbeing A-12, A-13, and A-48 helped him.   The prosecution \n\n\nalleged that methyl alcohol used to be purchased by A-17 \n\n\noutside   the   state   of   Kerala   and   used   to   be   supplied   to \n\n\nA16 who delivered it to the godown at Pandaksala bearing \n\n\ndoor   No.   VI/98   of   Chirayinkil   Panchayat.     Pandaksala \n\n\nwas,   in   one   sense,   a   factory   for   the   production   of   the \n\n\nspurious liquor as per the prosecution case. There is no \n\n\ndispute  that Pandaksala  godown was  owned and  controlled \n\n\ncompletely by A-7.   The prosecution alleged against him \n\n\nthat A-7 was doing the business in liquor in the name of \n\n\na   firm   called   Ushus   Traders.     His   wife&#x27;s   name   is   Usha \n\n\nand   her   younger   sister&#x27;s   name   is   Ambili   and   it   was \n\n\nalleged by the prosecution that his wife&#x27;s brother Raju \n\n\nalso   helped   him   in   his   business.     There   was   a   large \n\n\norganization which becomes clear from the fact that his \n\n\npremises   were   raided   by   the   Income   Tax   Department   on \n\n\n14.10.1999.   PW-127, A. Mohan is the deputy Director of \n\n\nIncome   Tax   who   conducted   the   raid   along   with   others. \n\n\nSworn   statements   were   recorded   from   A-7   as   also   the \n\n\noriginal accused No.15 on that day.   Prosecution proved \n\n\nsome   documents   relating   to   this   raid   vide   Exhibits   P-\n\n\n335, 336, 337 and 338.   The statement of A-7 was marked \n\n\nas   Exhibit   P-339   while   that   of   A-15   as   Exhibit   P-340. \n\n\nStatements   of   others   were   also   recorded   they   being \n\n\nExhibits P-341, 342 and 343.

Accounts were \n\n\ncontained   in   Exhibit   P-335   and   P-336.     A   bunch   of \n\n\nduplicate   stickers   was   also   found   vide   Exhibit   P-338. \n\n\nThey were of Kerala State Bewerage Corporation allegedly \n\n\nsigned   by   the   Excise   Commissioner.     It   came   in   light \n\n\nthat   they   used   to   sell   arrack   in   150   litre   cover \n\n\nindicated   in   the   accounts   as   letters   PKT   or   P2   while \n\n\ntoddy used to be mixed with spirit that was indicated as \n\n\nSpl.     The   more   potent   brand   which   was   by   adding   spirit \n\n\nto toddy was named as KP.  The spirit which was brought, \n\n\nof   course,   illegally   was   indicated   as   SBT.

The   High   Court   has \n\n\nrightly   held   that   this   could   not   bring   to   light   the \n\n\noffence under Section 57A.   However, the High Court had \n\n\nheld that this went on to suggest that there was a huge \n\n\nbusiness going on in liquor and at times by mixing toddy \n\n\nwith ethyl alcohol.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">25.

Joswa,   conducted   a   search   in   the   outhouse   vide \n\n\nExhibit   P134   and   found   two   tanks   of   5   thousand   litres \n\n\ncapacity  in the  underground cellar  of the  North-Eastern \n\n\ncorner   of   the   building.     These   tanks   were   fitted   with \n\n\nPVC   pipes   for   the   purpose   of   filling   and   emptying   the \n\n\nsame.   The sample collected from the tanks for chemical \n\n\nanalysis showed that it was ethyl alcohol.  In a raid by \n\n\nPW-249,   Rajan   John   who   was   the   Circle   Inspector   of \n\n\nPolice,   Kadakkavoor,   broken   parts   of   four   synthetic \n\n\ntanks   of   5   thousand   capacity   were   found   as   also   the \n\n\ntanks   of   one   thousand   litres   and   synthetic   tank   of   5 \n\n\nthousand litres were found and seized.  They were buried \n\n\nin   the   South-Eastern   portion   of   the   building.     Multi-\n\n\npack   machine   with   two   keys   was   found   concealed   in   the \n\n\nNorthern-Eastern   part   of   the   building.     PVC   pipe \n\n\nconnection   was   seen   going   to   the   property   of   A-7.     The \n\n\nHigh   Court   has   referred   to   the   oral   evidence   and   has \n\n\nalso   referred   to   number   of   documents   to   show   that \n\n\nseveral   buildings   were   owned,   possessed   and   controlled \n\n\nby   A-7   and   his   wife   wherefrom   A-7   conducted   his   liquor \n\n\nbusiness.

When   the   factory   of   A-7   was   searched   by   PW-\n\n\n270,K.K.Joswa   on   18.11.2000   vide   Exhibit   P106   he \n\n\ndetected underground cellar with 18 synthetic tanks of 5 \n\n\nthousand capacity each arranged in two rows of nine each \n\n\ncontaining   illicit   liquor.     It   is   found   that   all   these \n\n\ntanks   had   48,600   of   liquor.     PW-71,   C.

All   this   shows \n\n\nthe huge volume of business of A-7.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_67\">27.    The   High   court   has   further   held   that   the   toddy \n\n\nbusiness was carried on in the building where firm Ushus \n\n\nTraders was operating.  The toddy godown was just behind \n\n\nthe   Ushus   office   in   building   bearing   No.CP   III/580. \n\n\nThe said godown was a licenced one for conducting toddy \n\n\nshop   Nos.1   to   26   of   Chirayinkil   village.     Two   hidden \n\n\ntanks were found vide M.Os 63 and 64 and it is here that \n\n\nthe liquor activities connected with business were going \n\n\non.   The High Court has held that the registered owners \n\n\nChellamma   and   Sahadevan   were   not   in   the   possession   of \n\n\npremises.  In this search, one tank of 5 thousand litres \n\n\ncapacity, two tanks of 1 thousand capacity and one tank \n\n\nof 2 thousand capacity were seized.   So also from these \n\n\npremises the vehicles with fake numbers, they being M.O. \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                     3</span>\n\n\n\n\nNos. 83, 84, 85 and 86 were seized from these premises. \n\n\nThe High Court also referred to analysis of cotton swabs \n\n\ncollected   from   this   place   which   showed   that   there   was \n\n\nmethyl   alcohol.     Still   another   property   of   19.5   cents \n\n\nshown   as   Arayathuruthu   was   also   found   being   owned   by \n\n\nRaju   who   was   brother   of   A-18.     This   property   was   also \n\n\nused   by   A-7   to   destroy   the   evidence   by   burning   plastic \n\n\ncans and other items.  Still another property in village \n\n\nSarkara   was   used   by   A-7   for   illicit   business   which   was \n\n\nclear   from   the   documents   seized   by   PW-256,   P.K. \n\n\nKuttappan in the presence of PW-119, Asheraf.   The High \n\n\nCourt also made reference to other properties which were \n\n\nused   by   A-7   for   the   purpose   of   illicit   business,   which \n\n\nproperties   belonged   to   mother-in-law   of   A-7.     The   High \n\n\nCourt rightly came to the conclusion that it was A-7 who \n\n\nwas   controlling   the   whole   affair.     It   is   significant \n\n\nthat when trace evidence was collected from the vehicles \n\n\nseized   from   the   areas,   in   some   of   the   items   methyl \n\n\nalcohol was detected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">28.    It is not as if methyl alcohol was restricted only \n\n\nto   the   above   mentioned   premises.     However,   from   the \n\n\nevidence   of   PW-256   it   has   come   out   that   some   plastic \n\n\ncans   were   also   found   in   the   search   conducted   by   him   in \n\n\nThundathhil Purayidom which was in possession of accused \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                   3</span>\n\n\n\n\nNo.7.     The   chemical   analysis   of   the   contents   of   those \n\n\ncans   showed   that   methyl   alcohol   was   detected   in   four \n\n\nitems.        In   the   toddy   godown   of   A-7   from \n\n\nVanchiyurkadavilla   these   vehicles   were   seen   abandoned \n\n\nand from a Maruti car having registration No. PYOIN 463 \n\n\nmethyl alcohol was detected in the samples taken. Methyl \n\n\nalcohol   was   also   detected   from   the   mini   lorry   bearing \n\n\nregistration No.KL 01 843 belonging to A-7.   Some other \n\n\nvehicles were belonging to A-4 who was none else but the \n\n\nbrother of A-7 and in those vehicles also methyl alcohol \n\n\nwas   detected.     The   High   Court   has   noted   the   further \n\n\nargument   that   the   detection   of   methyl   alcohol   from   the \n\n\ntrace   evidence   was   not   possible.     However,   it   has \n\n\nfurther   observed   that   PW-233,   Sindhu,   Assistant \n\n\nDirector,   Forensic   Sciences   very   clearly   deposed   that \n\n\neven if there is evaporation, even after 10 days, it is \n\n\npossible   to   detect   the   absorbed   molecules   of   a   liquid. \n\n\nIt   was,   therefore,   clear   from   her   evidence   that   the \n\n\nscientific   evidence   collected   by   the   prosecution   was \n\n\nrightly relied upon by the Courts below and we also find \n\n\nno   reason   to   reject   that   evidence.     Therefore,   it   is \n\n\nclear   that   methyl   alcohol   which   was   the   main   culprit, \n\n\nwas   not   only   a   dangerously   poisonous   substance   but   was \n\n\nalso   used   in   mixing   the   liquor   which   was   under   the \n\n\ncontrol   of   A-7   who   was   being   helped   by   his   brothers, \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                      4</span>\n\n\n\n\nservants and relatives.  We will consider separately the \n\n\nevidence against A-4 and A-8 who were the brothers of A-\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">7.   However, one thing was certain that this was a huge \n\n\nwell-oiled machinery for running the liquor business and \n\n\nthe   enormousness   is   mind-boggling.     All   this   suggests \n\n\nthat A-7 was the captain of the whole team.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">29.    The   High   Court   has   also   commented   on   the   evidence \n\n\nof   PW-61,   Dennis   A.   and   PW-57,   Thulasidar   and   has   also \n\n\nreferred   to   the   evidence   of   officers   of   BSNL,   Escotel \n\n\nand BPL for the use of land phones and mobile phones and \n\n\nconversation   in   between   A-7   and   A-4   as   also   the   others \n\n\nincluding   the   servants   and   relatives.     The   High   Court \n\n\nhas then proceeded to believe the evidence that the cans \n\n\nwhich   were   having   the   illicit   liquor   duly   mixed   with \n\n\nmethyl alcohol were removed from the godown and for this \n\n\npurpose   has   relied   upon   the   evidence   of   C.   Somarajan \n\n\n(PW-79),   the   cashier   of   the   petrol   pump   as   also   the \n\n\nevidence   of   PW-76,   Anfar,   the   auto   rickshaw   driver   who \n\n\nhad   seen   the   vehicles   which   were   used   for   removing   the \n\n\nliquor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">30.    The   reason   why   accused   No.7   had   to   mix   the   methyl \n\n\nalcohol   and/or   methynol   is   not   far   to   see.     It   is \n\n\nclarified   from   the   evidence   of   PW-96,   V.   Ajith   Kumar \n\n\nthat   A-7   had   put   the   bid   of   Rs.   4   crores   for   the   26 \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                     4</span>\n\n\n\n\ntoddy   shops   and   even   if   all   the   toddy   shops   had   worked \n\n\nin their full capacity he could not have recovered even \n\n\nhalf the amount and it was, therefore, that this idea of \n\n\nbringing   ethyl   alcohol,   mixing   it   with   methyl   alcohol \n\n\nand   creating   various   drinks   like  Kalapani  etc.   was \n\n\nmooted.     The   result   thereof   was   for   all   to   see   which \n\n\nresulted   in   death   of   31   persons.     The   High   Court   has \n\n\ncorrectly observed that the basic reason for bidding for \n\n\n26 shops for toddy was to get the legitimate godown for \n\n\ntoddy.     It   is   proved   that   those   godowns,   instead,   were \n\n\nused not for storing toddy but for storing ethyl alcohol \n\n\nand   mixing   it   with   methyl   alcohol   for   making   enormous \n\n\nprofits.     It   is   not   as   if   A-7   was   selling   only   toddy. \n\n\nIn   addition   to   that   he   was   creating   various   drinks \n\n\npreferably  by mixing  ethyl alcohol  with methyl  alcohol. \n\n\nThus,   there   was   a   full   liquor   industry   going   on   under \n\n\nhis captainship.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">31.    The last nail in the coffin is the evidence of PW-\n\n\n53,   Sunil.     We   have   very   carefully   gone   through   his \n\n\nevidence   and   the   High   Court   has   also   extensively   dealt \n\n\nwith his evidence.  PW-53 is a close relative of A-7 and \n\n\nworked   in   the   godown   from   March,   2000.     Before   that   he \n\n\nwas supplying spirit to A-7 from various places.  He has \n\n\ngraphically   described   in   his   evidence   as   to   how   the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                     4</span>\n\n\n\n\nspirit   business   was   being   done   inasmuch   as   he   deposed \n\n\nthat the spirit used to be brought from the tankers and \n\n\nused to be collected in the syntex tanks and was filled \n\n\nin   35   litres   cans.     This   spirit   was   used   for   making   a \n\n\ndrink   called  Kalapani  by   mixing   with   essence   and   some \n\n\ntoddy.  It was then filled in the cans and dispatched in \n\n\nthe vehicles.  The evidence of this witness further goes \n\n\non to show the position of godown which was used for the \n\n\nstorage   of   ethyl   alcohol   and   methyl   alcohol.     He \n\n\nreferred   to   methyl   alcohol   as   `essence&#x27;.     He   described \n\n\nthat   the   spirit   was   brought   from   Karnataka   and   essence \n\n\nused to come on Thursdays in a white Fiat car.  The Fiat \n\n\ncar   had   a   secrete   chamber.     That   car   was   identified   as \n\n\nM.O.-24.     The   tank   and   the   platform   were   built   in   the \n\n\nback   seat   and   the   front   seat   of   the   car.     There   were \n\n\nthree   valves   attached   to   the   same   and   35   litres   of \n\n\nmethyl alcohol i.e. the essence could be carried in the \n\n\nsaid car.  He gave a graphic description of mixture with \n\n\nspirit which ultimately was sold.  He specifically named \n\n\nA-20,   A-22,   A-23   and   A-21   who   were   supervising   the \n\n\nmixing.     In   his   evidence   he   has   also   specifically \n\n\nreferred   that   he   had   seen   M.O.-24,   the   car,   importing \n\n\nthe   essence   i.e.   the   methyl   alcohol   precisely   two   days \n\n\nprior to the liquor tragedy.  He has also named A-16 and \n\n\nanother boy who were the occupants of the said car.   He \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                     4</span>\n\n\n\n\nalso   suggested   that   he   and   the   other   employees   were \n\n\nfilling  up the  essence in  10 cans.   The  High Court  has \n\n\nreferred   to   the   further   evidence   on   the   part   of   this \n\n\nwitness that in the night at about 10.30 p.m. the tanker \n\n\nlorry came with spirit and the said spirit was filled in \n\n\nthe   syntex   tank   and   cans.     Those   half   filled   cans   were \n\n\nthen   filled   with   the   methyl   alcohol   meaning   thereby   it \n\n\nwas mixed.  He then went on to depose that the employees \n\n\nof   A-4,   namely,   A-5,   A-6,   A-9   and   A-10   came   there   with \n\n\nthree vehicles and essence and they mixed up the essence \n\n\nwith   the   spirit.   He   claimed   that   in   all   60   cans   were \n\n\nfilled   up   and   were   dispatched   in   three   cars   for \n\n\ntransporting   to   various   places   for   sale.     According   to \n\n\nhim he came to know about the Kalluvathaukkal tragedy on \n\n\n21.10.2000.   On  that day  at about  7.30 p.m.  A-7 and  15 \n\n\ncame and slapped Vijayan for not properly mixing and A-7 \n\n\nthen   left   the   place   telling   them   to   destroy   the \n\n\nevidence.     According   to   him,   thereafter,   what   was   left \n\n\nin the syntex tank was poured in the river, un-used cans \n\n\nwere   removed   and   plastic   covers   were   disposed   of   by \n\n\nsetting fire.   A-7 had also taken adequate care to send \n\n\naway   the   employees   for   sometime   and   it   was   through   him \n\n\nthat   the   witness   came   to   know   that   people   had   died   by \n\n\ndrinking   the   spirit   supplied   by   A-4   and   his   employees \n\n\ndue to a mistake in mixing by A-20 and A-22. \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                     4</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">32.    Shri   Radhakrishnan,   learned   Senior   Counsel   very \n\n\nseriously   argued   that   even   if   the   evidence   of   this \n\n\nwitness   is   entirely   accepted,   it   does   not   suggest   that \n\n\nA-7   himself   mixed   the   methyl   alcohol   with   the   spirit \n\n\nand, therefore, there could be no question of his being \n\n\nbooked   under   <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_60\">Section   57A</a>   of   the   Abkari   Act.     We   have \n\n\nalready   explained   the   real   scope   of   Section   57A.     For \n\n\nbeing convicted under that Section, it is not necessary \n\n\nthat   the   person   concerned   must   himself   do   the   mixing. \n\n\nIt   is   obvious   that   A-7   was   the   boss.     In   fact   PW-53 \n\n\ndescribes   him   as   the   boss.     It   is,   therefore,   obvious \n\n\nthat   everything   was   done   as   per   his   command   and   if   it \n\n\nwas so, then in order to be convicted under Section 57A, \n\n\nthe   prosecution   is   not   required   to   prove   that   A-7 \n\n\nphysically   mixed   the   methyl   alcohol   or   the   injurious \n\n\nsubstance with the spirit.   In our opinion, even if A-7 \n\n\ncommanded   his   servants   to   mix   up,   he   is   equally   guilty \n\n\nunder   the   Section.   In   fact   illegally   importing   ethyl \n\n\nalcohol and mixing the same with methanol was a regular \n\n\ntrading   activity   on   the   part   of   A-7.     The   licences   for \n\n\nrunning   the   toddy   shops   was   merely   a   facade.   He   had \n\n\nundoubtedly   put   a   very   tall   bid   for   those   licences   and \n\n\ncould not have afforded to continue merely on the basis \n\n\nof   those   26   toddy   shops.     The   High   Court   has   rightly \n\n\nreferred to that part and we approve of the High Court&#x27;s \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                     4</span>\n\n\n\n\nfindings   in   that   behalf.     Therefore,   he   gave   his \n\n\nbusiness   a   complete   new   turn,   that   is,   instead     of \n\n\nselling   toddy   through   those   outlets   he   started   selling \n\n\nalcoholic drink prepared from ethyl alcohol and methanol \n\n\nand that illegally imported both and all this was going \n\n\non with the corrupt cooperation of those who could have \n\n\nchecked it.  Therefore, it is a proved position from the \n\n\nevidence   of   PW-53   that   A-7   was   the   boss   of   the   illegal \n\n\ntrade. He got the methanol imported and used his godown \n\n\nwhich he rightfully possessed on account of his licences \n\n\nfor   26   shops.     Therefore,   his   knowledge   that   methanol \n\n\nwas   being   mixed,   the   fact   that   he   was   running   the \n\n\nbusiness   along   with   his   hirelings   and   the   further   fact \n\n\nthat he used to be present at the time of the mixing are \n\n\nproperly   proved   by   the   prosecution   with   the   aid   of \n\n\ntestimony   of   PW-53   and   are   enough   for   a   finding   about \n\n\nSection 57A (1) (ii).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">33.

Shri   Radhakrishnan   tried   to   take \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                     4</span>\n\n\n\n\nadvantage   of   this   evidence   suggesting   that   it   was   A-20 \n\n\nto   23   who   were   actually   mixing   methanol   which   was \n\n\ndelivered   by   the   workers   of   A-4   from   the   godown   in   the \n\n\nvery same night.  From this, Shri Radhakrishnan tried to \n\n\nargue   that   it   was   not   actually   mixed   by   A-7.     It   was \n\n\nclear   that   this   mixing   took   place   at   Pandaksala   godown \n\n\nowned by A-7.   Shri Radhakrishnan also pointed out that \n\n\nthe High Court had held that the accused No.7 was liable \n\n\nto be convicted for offence under Section 57A (1) (ii). \n\n\nIt  was also  pointed out  by him  that the  High Court  had \n\n\nobserved   that   he   could   not   be   convicted   under   Section \n\n\n57A (1) (i) and (iii).  In short, the contention is that \n\n\nsince   according   to   the   evidence   of   PW-53,   A-7   had   not \n\n\nhimself   mixed   or   did   not   permit   to   be   mixed   noxious \n\n\nsubstance endangering the human life with any liquor or \n\n\nintoxicating   drug   A-7   could   not   be   convicted   for   the \n\n\noffence under Section 57 A 1 (ii) also.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">34.    The   argument   is   clearly   fallacious.     We   have \n\n\nalready   pointed   out   that   it   was   not   necessary   that   A-7 \n\n\nhad   physically   mixed   the   methyl   alcohol   for   his   being \n\n\nconvicted.     It   was   actually   done   on   his   command   and \n\n\nwithin his knowlege.  His offence could also come within \n\n\nthe   definition   on   account   of   the   other   words   of   the \n\n\nSection   `or   permits   to   be   mixed&#x27;.     While   interpreting \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                      4</span>\n\n\n\n\nthese   words,   namely,  `whoever   mixes   or   permits   to   be  \n\n\nmixed&#x27;  the   real   import   of   the   words   would   have   to   be \n\n\ntaken into consideration and thereby if A-7 directed his \n\n\nservants to mix methanol with methyl alcohol that would \n\n\nalso be covered within the scope of the words `mixes or  \n\n\npermits   to   be   mixed&#x27;   in   the   Section.     It   has   already \n\n\ncome   in   the   evidence   that   all   this   mixing   was   done   at \n\n\nthe   instance   of,   with   the   direction   of   and   to   the \n\n\nknowledge   of   the   accused   No.7.   He   was   the   king   pin   or \n\n\nthe main actor on whom the huge business of liquor trade \n\n\nrested.     It   cannot,   therefore,   be   said   that   the \n\n\nconviction under section 57A (1) (ii) was in any manner \n\n\nincorrect.  Of course that would be only and only if the \n\n\nevidence   of   PW-53   along   with   other   relevant   witnesses \n\n\nheld to be reliable.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">35.    There is no reason for us to discard the testimony \n\n\nof  PW-53 which  was read  word to  word before  us by  Shri \n\n\nRadhakrishnan.     We   find   that   the   evidence   was   most \n\n\nnatural   and   was   not   shaken   in   any   manner   in   his   cross-\n\n\nexamination.          He   has   given   a   complete   graphic \n\n\ndescription   of   what   happened.     He   claimed   that   he   was \n\n\nworking   with   A-7   from   March,   2000   in   the   godown   and \n\n\nbefore that he used to supply spirit in different places \n\n\nfor   A-7.     He   gave   the   names   of   persons   working   in   the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                     4</span>\n\n\n\n\nPandaksala godown.  He referred to methanol as `essence&#x27; \n\n\nand   pointed   out   that   essence   was   added   to   the   spirit \n\n\ncollected   in   syntax   tank   to   make  Kalapani  and   then   it \n\n\nused to be filled in the plastic vessels having capacity \n\n\nof 35 litres.  He pointed out that the spirit was poured \n\n\nin   the   small   syntax   tanks   and   little   toddy,   water, \n\n\npowder   etc.   were   mixed   and   essence   used   to   be   added   to \n\n\nit  and that  substance and  then it  used to  be filled  in \n\n\nthe   bottles.   He   gave   graphically   the   details   of   the \n\n\noperations and also deposed that apart from the 26 toddy \n\n\nshops,   his   boss   was   running   75   shops   without   licences \n\n\nand it was a small scale industry.   He asserted that it \n\n\nis   only   the   things   supplied   by   the   boss   which   are   sold \n\n\nin   those   shops.     He   asserted   that   when   the   essence   was \n\n\nmixed   in   the   spirit   the   vitality   would   increase.     He \n\n\nalso described the role of Anil Kumar (A-16) who used to \n\n\nbring   essence   and   come   only   on   certain   days   in   month \n\n\nmostly on Thursdays.  He also described the Fiat car and \n\n\nthe secret tank and pointed out that the essence brought \n\n\ntherein   used   to   be   filled   in   plastic   vessels   having \n\n\ncapacity   of   35   litres   through   hose   and   by   using   hand \n\n\nmotor and essence used to be added to the spirit in the \n\n\ntank   and   then   the   concoction   used   to   be   supplied   for \n\n\nsale.  He spoke about the night when the whole operation \n\n\ntook place and involved A-4, A-22 and A-21.   He pointed \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                     4</span>\n\n\n\n\nout   that   alcohol   came   in   the   tanker   at   night.     The \n\n\nconcoction   was   prepared   by   accused   Vijayan,   Suresh, \n\n\nMonkuttan and Rasool.   Three cars came thereafter being \n\n\nwhite   Maruti   Van,   red   Maruti   car   and   Blue   Maruti   car. \n\n\nAfter mixing, the cars were sent of.   The said material \n\n\nwas taken to the dealers of A-7.   He has also spoken as \n\n\nto what happened on 21.10.2000 when accused Balachandran \n\n\nand   A-7   came   and   A-7   gave   a   beating   to   Vijayan   asking \n\n\nhim   as   to   how   mixing   was   not   properly   done.     He   then \n\n\ndirected the whole remaining material to be poured into \n\n\nthe river and to destroy the cans.   Accordingly, as per \n\n\nthe   direction,   the   concoction   in   the   Syntex   tank   was \n\n\npoured   in   the   river   and   the   cans   and   the   covers   were \n\n\nburnt   and   buried   under   the   sand.     He   pointed   out   that \n\n\nthe essence mixed spirit was taken to the shed belonging \n\n\nto   A-7   Attukadavu.     He   spoke   about   the   electronic \n\n\nmachine,   hand   machine   and   the   process   of   filling   the \n\n\nconcoction in the plastic cans.   He pointed out that on \n\n\nthat day all the plastic covers were burnt by them.  A-7 \n\n\nhad also directed the witness and the other servants to \n\n\nremain   absconding.     In   his   cross-examination,   he   not \n\n\nonly identified A-7 but called him Boss and Annan, elder \n\n\nbrother. Some irrelevant questions were put to him which \n\n\nhe answered suggesting that the property belonged to A-7 \n\n\nand the godown also belonged to him and the mixing used \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                    5</span>\n\n\n\n\nto be done there only.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">36.    We   have   seen   the   whole   evidence   very   carefully. \n\n\nThough   he   was   subjected   to   lengthy   cross-examination, \n\n\nthe   main   story   about   the   mixing   has   not   suffered   any \n\n\ndent.     On   the   other   hand,   the   operation   of   mixing   was \n\n\nexplained   again   in   the   cross-examination.     He   owned   up \n\n\nthat he himself carried Kalapani on number of occasions \n\n\nto the various shops of A-7. The evidence given by this \n\n\nwitness   sounds   truthful   because   he   has   not   tried   to \n\n\njustify   himself   nor   has   he   made   any   efforts   to   save \n\n\nhimself.  Most of the cross-examination was stereotyped, \n\n\nlimiting   to   the   minor   omissions   in   his   statement   under \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 161</a> and <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_62\">164</a> Cr.P.C.  Even at the instance of the \n\n\nother   accused   persons,   nothing   much   has   come   about   in \n\n\nhis cross-examination.  In his cross-examination by A-4, \n\n\nhe   again   explained   the   role   of   Anil   Kumar   who   brought \n\n\nmethanol   and   asserted   the   role   played   by   A-4.     In   the \n\n\ncross-examination by A-5, A-6, and A-1 also merely some \n\n\nomissions   were   brought   which   were   insignificant. \n\n\nHowever, considering the whole evidence, this witness is \n\n\ncreditworthy.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_86\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"63794871\" id=\"span_57\">37.    Shri   Radhakrishnan,   however,   pointed   out   that   the \n\n\nevidence of this witness is in the nature of evidence of \n\n\nan accomplice and has to be red in the light of Section \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                      5</span>\n\n\n\n\n133 and <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 114B</a> of the Indian Evidence Act and that \n\n\nhe   also   reiterated   the   settled   principles   that   an \n\n\naccomplice   must   be   tested   with   respect   to   his \n\n\nreliability and if he is unreliable his evidence cannot \n\n\nbe   the   basis   of   the   prosecution   case.   Learned   counsel \n\n\nfurther   argued   that   if   the   witness   is   found   reliable \n\n\nthen   his   evidence   must   be   corroborated   in   material \n\n\nparticulars.  Learned senior counsel relied on <a href=\"/doc/63794871/\" id=\"a_64\">Shankar @  \n\n\nGauri Shankar v. State of Tamil Nadu</a>  [1994 (4) SCC 478] \n\nas   also  Rampal   Pithwa   Rahidas   v.State   of   Maharashtra \n\n\n(1994)   Suppl.   (2)   SCC   73,  more   particularly,   in \n\nparagraphs 14 and 15 in the previous case and paragraph \n\n\n9 in the latter case.</span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">38.    Shri   Radhakrishnan   further   argued   that   the   witness \n\n\nhad  stated that  he was  in good  terms with  A-7 and  that \n\n\nhe   did   not   quarrel   with   A-7.     This   was   suggested   as   a \n\n\nstrange   conduct.     He   also   pointed   out   that   the   witness \n\n\nhad   stated   that   he   had   acted   under   the   instructions   of \n\n\nhis   boss.     It   is   seen   from   the   evidence   that   he   was   a \n\n\nminion of his boss i.e. A-7 and he answered that he gave \n\n\nall   the   answers   to   the   police   as   per   the   instructions \n\n\ngiven   to   him   by   A-7   there   is   nothing   unnatural   in   it. \n\n\nHe   was   a   very   small   fry   as   compared   to   a   mighty \n\n\nbusinessman   like   A-7   and   it   was   suggested   by   Shri \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                    5</span>\n\n\n\n\nRadhakrishnan   that   his   evidence   did   suggest   that   his \n\n\nbehaviour was strange.  Shri Radhakrishnan insisted that \n\n\nthis   witness   was   insisting   that   he   had   good   relations \n\n\nwith   A-7   and   yet   he   deposed   against   A-7   and   this, \n\n\namounted   to   strange   behaviour.     Under   the   peculiar \n\n\ncircumstances   of   this   case   considering   the   position   of \n\n\nthis   witness   vis-`-vis   A-7,   we   do   not   think   that   this \n\n\namounts to a very strange behaviour on account of which \n\n\nthis   witness   should   be   stamped   with   as   an   unreliable \n\n\nwitness.   Shri Radhakrishnan pointed out that PW-53 was \n\n\nunder   the   tutelage   of   the   police   from   20th  November   and \n\n\nwas   tutored   by   the   police.     His   Section   164   statement \n\n\nseems   to   have   been   recorded   on   15th  January   and   Section \n\n\n161   statement   was   prior   to   that.     Shri   Radhakrishnan \n\n\npointed   out   that   both   his   statements   were   clubbed \n\n\ntogether  and there  he himself  admitted having  committed \n\n\nthe offence under the <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_65\">Abkari Act</a>.   Shri Radhakrishanam, \n\n\ntherefore,   argued   that   the   police   should   have   arrested \n\n\nhim but the police neither arrested him nor included him \n\n\nin   the   array   of   accused.     Instead   the   prosecution \n\n\nplanted   him   as   a   prosecution   witness.     In   that   the \n\n\nlearned  counsel further  argued that  the prosecution  did \n\n\nnot   also   resort   to   the   procedure   under   section   306   for \n\n\nclaiming pardon for the witness nor did not prosecution \n\n\njoin him later on as an accused under section 319 of the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                           5</span>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_66\">Cr.P.C</a>.   The   learned   counsel   further   argued   that   the \n\n\npolice   were   very   soft   towards   PW-53   who   was   an   accused \n\n\nin   two   Abkari   cases.     He   was   also   immediately   granted \n\n\nbail in those cases and, therefore, the prosecution had \n\n\nacted   it   in   an   unfair   manner.     Learned   senior   counsel \n\n\nalso suggested that PW-53 was on inimical terms towards \n\n\nA-7   and,   therefore,   his   evidence   would   have   to   be \n\n\nevaluated   with   caution.     Shri   Radhakrishnan   also   urged \n\n\nthat         there         were         number         of          prevarications, \n\n\ninconsistencies,                discrepancies,               improvements         and \n\n\nomissions   in   the   testimony   of   PW-53   which   were \n\n\nhighlighted   by   the   learned   counsel.     Ultimately   it   was \n\n\nargued   that   his   evidence   was   even   not   materially \n\n\ncorroborated. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_90\">39.     Learned   counsel   also   argued   that   the   evidence   of \n\n\nPW-53 could not materially prove ingredients of offence, \n\n\nnamely, mixes or permits to be mixes, under section 57A \n\n\n(1)   (i)   at   Pandaksala   godown.     Sudheer,   PW-60   was \n\n\ndescribed   as   a   planted   witness   while   Dennis   A.(PW-61) \n\n\nwas   said   to   be   a   chance   witness.     It   was   also   argued \n\n\nthat   at   the   most   A-7   could   have   been   convicted   under \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_67\">section 55 (a) (g) (h) (i)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_68\">58</a> of the Abkari Act as \n\n\nit was not proved that he had mixed or permitted to mix \n\n\nmethanol with ethyl alcohol for selling the same in the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                     5</span>\n\n\n\n\nmarket.   Shri Radhakrishnan also argued that though the \n\n\nburden   of   proof   under   Section   57A   (5)   was   on   the \n\n\naccused, the prosecution has miserably failed to project \n\n\nthe case of Section57A (1) (i) and (ii) and the accused \n\n\nhas discharged his burden under Section 55 by adverting \n\n\nto the evidence in the case in hand.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">40.    Lastly,   it   was   pointed   that   there   was   no   question \n\n\nof   any   conspiracy   and   even   if   there   was   any   conspiracy \n\n\nall the links in the conspiracy were snapped by A-13, 14 \n\n\nand 48. It was pointed out that in fact it was A-17 who \n\n\nhad   placed   the   order   for   methanol   with   the   chemical \n\n\ncompany and entrusted the two barrels of methanol to A-\n\n\n16   to   import   the   same   to   Kerala.     However,   A-17   stood \n\n\nacquitted.     So   also   A-12,   13,   143   and   48   who   were \n\n\nalleged   to   have   brought   ethyl   alcohol   for   mixing   were \n\n\nalso   acquitted.     Therefore,   it   was   suggested   that   no \n\n\nethyl   alcohol   was   brought   at   all   and   the   methanol   was \n\n\nalso not mixed much less at the instance of A-7. \n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">41.    Before   we   consider   the   other   contentions   which   we \n\n\nhave   referred   to   in   the   earlier   paragraphs,   we   must \n\n\nfirst   consider   the   argument   of   Shri   Radhakrishnan \n\n\nregarding   PW-53   being   an   accomplice   and   the   so-called \n\n\nunfairness on the part of prosecution in not prosecuting \n\n\nhim   or   not   proceeding   under   <a href=\"/doc/122405/\" id=\"a_69\">section   306</a>   Cr.P.C.     The \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                     5</span>\n\n\n\n\nlearned   Counsel   was   vociferous   in   further   suggesting \n\n\nthat   the   evidence   of   this   witness   firstly   is   not \n\n\nreliable   as   it   is   not   corroborated   in   material \n\n\nparticulars   as   required   under   <a href=\"/doc/274935/\" id=\"a_70\">section   133</a>   and   <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_71\">114   B   </a>of \n\n\nthe   Indian   Evidence   Act.     We   have   already   pointed   out \n\n\nthat his evidence was generally found to be reliable as \n\n\nthere is very little in his cross-examination which will \n\n\ndestroy   his   testimony   or   would   even   affect   it   in   any \n\n\nmanner.     In   fact   it   was   not   our   task,   in   the   Supreme \n\n\nCourt   to   re-appreciate   the   evidence,   particularly,   when \n\n\nboth   the   Courts   below   have   not   only   appreciated   it   but \n\n\nhave   accepted   the   same   after   thoroughly   discussing   the \n\n\nintricacies   and   the   small   little   details   of   his \n\n\nevidence.     However,   we   have   done   that   exercise   in   the \n\n\nlight of the contention raised that this witness was not \n\n\nreliable   and   was   not   corroborated   in   material \n\n\nparticulars.          In   fact   there   are   very   weighty \n\n\ncorroborations to the evidence of this witness.  We must \n\n\nrefer   to   the   evidence   of   PW-60,   Sudheer   who   is   the \n\n\ndriver.     He   deposed   that   he   got   acquainted   with   A-16, \n\n\nAnil Kumar and he assured him of a job.   It was at his \n\n\ninstance   that   he   went   to   Husur   and   he   was   engaged   to \n\n\ndrive   the   Fiat   car   which   was   to   collect   some   material \n\n\nfrom   there   to   Chirayinkeezhu.     He   thus,   went   to \n\n\nChirayankeezhu   in   the   car   having   registration   No.   TMY \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                     5</span>\n\n\n\n\n8746.  He referred to the secret chamber in that car and \n\n\nthrough his conversation with A-16, he also came to know \n\n\nthat   the   material   that   he   was   carrying   in   the   secret \n\n\nchamber   was   poison.     He   referred   to   the   godown   of   A-7 \n\n\nwhich   was   6-7   Kms.   away   from   Atitingal   Junction.     He \n\n\nalso met A-7 and said that he used to pay the price of \n\n\nthe stuff and in his absence, Manikantan @ Kochani (A-4) \n\n\nused   to   make   the   payment.   He   referred   to   the   last \n\n\nThursday   when   claimed   that   he   had   brought   the   stuff   to \n\n\nChirayinkeezhu and came to know about the liquor tragedy \n\n\non Sunday when he was in Husur.  He has deposed that the \n\n\nstuff   which   he   brought   on   Thursday   in   the   car   was \n\n\nunloaded   in   A-7&#x27;s   godown   and   on   that   day   A-7&#x27;s   workers \n\n\nwere there.   This evidence is in complete corroboration \n\n\nof   the   evidence   of   PW-53   in   whose   presence   the   car   was \n\n\nbrought   by   A-16,   Anil   Kumar.     He   described   that   the \n\n\nstuff   which   was   purchased   used   to   be   filled   in   the \n\n\nsecret chambers of the car and after the tragedy, he was \n\n\nalso   told   by   A-16   to   leave   the   place.   The   witness   had \n\n\nalso   identified   A-7   and   A-16   as   also   A-4,   Kochani.     He \n\n\nalso   identified   the   Fiat   car.   It   is   to   be   noted   that \n\n\nwhen   the   samples   were   taken   from   this   car,   it   was \n\n\npositive for methanol.   Shri Radhakrishnan also did not \n\n\ncontest this position.  Most of his cross-examination is \n\n\nirrelevant.     Some   irrelevant   and   inadmissible   questions \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                     5</span>\n\n\n\n\nwere   also   put   to   him   in   the   cross-examination   in \n\n\nrelation   to   his   statement   to   the   police.     It   was   tried \n\n\nto   be   suggested   that   the   stuff   that   he   had   brought   in \n\n\nthat   car   was   not   methanol   or   poison.     However,   his \n\n\nevidence   on   the   whole   establishes   that   he   had   met   Anil \n\n\nKumar   and   was   working   for   him.     Apart   from   A-7,   there \n\n\nwas cross-examination at the instance of A-17, A-16 and \n\n\nA-4.   There will be no question about A-17 since he has \n\n\nalready   been   acquitted.     However,   we   do   not   find \n\n\nanything suspicious in the evidence of this witness even \n\n\nin his cross-examination of A-16 and A-4.   This witness \n\n\nhas   been   believed   by   the   Trial   Court   and   the   appellate \n\n\nCourt and, in our opinion, the evidence of this witness \n\n\nprovides   complete   corroboration   to   the   evidence   of   PW-\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">53.   This  is apart  from the  fact that  there is  another \n\n\npiece of evidence which corroborates the evidence of PW-\n\n\n53 which is to be found in the evidence of K. K. Joshua, \n\n\nPW-270.     The   description   given   by   the   Investigating \n\n\nOfficer, K.K. Joshua on his searches of the places and, \n\n\nmore   particularly,   of   the   places   as   described   by   PW-53 \n\n\ncompletely   tallies.   These   are   also   material   particulars \n\n\nwhich   would   lend   support   to   the   testimony   of   PW-53. \n\n\nShri Joshua has given the graphic description of all the \n\n\nplaces  where the  activity of  mixing used  to go  on.    He \n\n\nhas also spoken about all the six vehicles found on the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                    5</span>\n\n\n\n\nspot   and   some   of   which   were   with   fake   registration \n\n\nnumber.     He   has   spoken   about   the   search   at   Tabuk \n\n\nIndustries   where   a   black   can   having   capacity   of   10 \n\n\nlitres   was   found   and   on   eastern   side   of   that   building \n\n\nthere   was   a   platform   build   and   near   it   pump   sets   and \n\n\nhoses   were   also   kept.     He   has   referred   to   the   liquid \n\n\nwhich   was   collected.     He   has   also   spoken   about   the \n\n\nsynthetic   tank   having   capacity   of   five   thousand   litres \n\n\nwhich was kept on the platform.  He has also referred to \n\n\nthe   synthetic   tank   with   spirit   found   there.     He   had \n\n\ntaken   samples   D-1   to   D-18   which   were   ultimately   found \n\n\nwith   ethyl   alcohol.     He   had   also   searched   the   toddy \n\n\ngodown in Ushus building which was on the southern side \n\n\nof   Ushus   building   at   Pandaksala.       He   has   also   spoken \n\n\nabout the Pattarumadom house of A-7 at Kunthalloor where \n\n\nalso   two   underground   cellars   were   found   wherefrom   also \n\n\nhe   collected   samples.     He   has   also   referred   to \n\n\nChirayinkil   where   cans   were   recovered.     On   the   whole \n\n\nthere are number of other corroborations to the evidence \n\n\nof PW-53.   The Trial Court and the appellate Court have \n\n\nreferred   to   the   said   corroborations   and   have   given   a \n\n\nfinding that his evidence was materially corroborated in \n\n\nmaterial particulars.   In that view we need not take on \n\n\nourselves   the   task   of   referring   to   all   the \n\n\ncorroborations.   In paragraph 69 of the judgment of the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                     5</span>\n\n\n\n\nappellate   Court,   the   discussion   has   come   about   the \n\n\nevidence   of   this   witness   and   we   are   satisfied   by   that. \n\n\nThe   appellate   Court   has   also   discussed   about   the   ill-\n\n\neffects of methanol and has recorded a finding that the \n\n\nsamples   taken   from   the   place   belonging   to   A-7,   more \n\n\nparticularly,   the   syntax   tanks,   cans   and   other \n\n\nequipments,   it   was   found   that   there   was   ethyl   alcohol \n\n\nand methanol.   We are satisfied with the findings given \n\n\nby   the   appellate   court   and   the   Trial   Court   and, \n\n\ntherefore, we accept the evidence of this witness.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"563592\" id=\"span_67\">42.    The   argument   raised   was   that   this   evidence   could \n\n\nnot   be   taken   into   consideration   and   it   would   be \n\n\ninadmissible   because   this   witness,   though   was   an \n\n\naccomplice   he   was   neither   granted   pardon   under   <a href=\"/doc/122405/\" id=\"a_72\">Section \n\n\n306</a>   Cr.P.C.   nor   was   he   prosecuted   and   the   prosecution \n\n\nunfairly presented him as a witness for the prosecution. \n\n\nThe   contention   is   clearly   incorrect   in   view   of   the \n\n\ndecision   of   this   Court   in  <a href=\"/doc/563592/\" id=\"a_73\">Laxmipat   Choraria   &amp;   Ors.   V.  \n\n\nState Of Maharashtra</a> [AIR 1968 SC 938]. While commenting \n\non   this   aspect,   Hidayatullah,   J.   observed   in   paragraph \n\n\n13   that   there   were   number   of   decisions   in   the   High \n\n\nCourts   in   which   the   examination   of   one   of   the   suspects \n\n\nas   the   witness   was   not   held   to   be   legal   and   accomplice \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                     6</span>\n\n\n\n\nevidence   was   received   subject   to   safeguards   as \n\n\nadmissible evidence in the case. The Court held:</span>\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"809439\" id=\"span_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"515667\" id=\"span_70\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1484099\" id=\"span_71\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"549894\" id=\"span_72\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"240087\" id=\"span_73\">&quot;On the side of the State many cases were cited from the \nHigh Courts in India  in which the examination of one of \nthe suspects as a witness   was not held to   be illegal \nand   accomplice     evidence   was   received   subject   to \nsafeguards     as   admissible   evidence   in   the   case.     In \nthose cases, s. 342   of the Code and<a href=\"/doc/1109814/\" id=\"a_74\"> s. 5</a> of the Indian \nOaths   Act     were     considered   and   the   word   &#x27;accused&#x27;   as \nused   in   those   sections   was   held   to   denote   a   person \nactually  on trial  before a  court and  not    a person  who \ncould   have   been   so   tried.     The   witness   was,   of   course, \ntreated   as   an   accomplice.     The   evidence   of   such   an \naccomplice  was received  with necessary  caution in  those \ncases. These cases  have  all been  mentioned  in  In re \nKandaswami  Gounder(2), and it is not necessary to refer \nto  them    in detail  here.    The leading  cases are:  Queen \nEmperor   v.Mona   <a href=\"/doc/240087/\" id=\"a_75\">Puna   (3),   Banu   Singh   v.

Har   Prasad, \nBhargava</a>(11).   In these cases (and several others cited \nand, relied upon in them) it has been consistently held \nthat the evidence of an accomplice may be read although \nhe could have been tried jointly            with the accused.   In \nsome of these cases the evidence was re-ceived although \nthe   procedure   of   s.   337,   <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_80\">Criminal   Procedure   Code</a>   was \napplicable but was not followed.  It is not necessary to \ndeal   with   this   question   any   further   because   the \nconsensus of opinion in India is that the competency of \nan   accomplice   is   not   destroyed   because   he   could   have \nbeen tried jointly with the accused but was not and was \ninstead made to give evidence in the case.  <a href=\"/doc/1109814/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 5</a> of \nthe Indian Oaths Act and<a href=\"/doc/697591/\" id=\"a_82\"> s. 342</a> of the Code of Criminal \nProcedure do not stand in the way of such a procedure.&quot;</span></span></span></span></span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">The Court finally observed:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">&quot;It   is   not   necessary   to   deal   with   this   question   any \nfurther   because   the   consensus   of   opinion   in   India   is \nthat   the   competency   of   an   accomplice   is   not   destroyed \nbecause   he   could   have   been   tried   jointly   with   the \naccused   but   was   not   and   was   instead   made   to   give \nevidence in the  case.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                     6</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">The Court has also observed in paragraph 11:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">The   position   that   emerges   is   this   :   No   pardon   could   be \ntendered  to Ethyl  Wong because  the pertinent  provisions \ndid not apply.

The   prosecution   was \nnot   bound   to prosecute   her, if   they   thought   that \nher     evidence   was   necessary     to     break     a   smugglers&#x27; \nring.

The     expression   is \nalso     not     rendered   superfluous     because   if   given   the \nmeaning accepted by us it limits, the operation   of the \nexclusionary       clause       to       criminal   prosecution   as \nopposed  to investigations              and       civil   proceedings. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">It is to be noticed that although the   English Criminal \nEvidence   Act,   1898,   which   (omitting   the     immaterial \nwords)   provides     that   &quot;Every   person   charged       with   an \noffence......     shall   be   a   competent   witness   for   the \ndefence   at     every   stage   of   the   proceedings&quot;   was   not \ninterpreted     as   conferring   a   right   on   the   prisoner   of \ngiving   evidence   on   his   own     behalf     before     the   grand \njury   or   in     other     words,     it   received   a   limited \nmeaning; see Queen v.

Original   accused   No.27   turned \n\n\napprover   and   was   examined   as   PW-173.     Apart   from   these \n\n\npersons,   S.   Anil   Kumar   (PW-251),   M.   Madhu   (PW-257), \n\n\nPramod Kumar (PW-260) and PWs-263 to 278 were members of \n\n\nthe   special   investigating   team.     As   has   already   been \n\n\nstated,   1101   documents   were   proved   including   the \n\n\nmahazars,   investigation   papers   like   inquest   reports, \n\n\nseizure mahazars, account books, building tax assessment \n\n\nregisters,   room   rent   registers,   medical   certificates, \n\n\nchemical   analysis   reports   etc.     We   must   appreciate   the \n\n\nHerculean effort on the part of the investigating agency \n\n\nfor collecting the evidence as also the efforts shown by \n\n\nthe Sessions Judge.   Amongst the material objects which \n\n\ncame   before   the   Court   and   were   observed   and   commented \n\n\nupon   by   it   include   the   pouch   filling   machine,   vessels, \n\n\nsynthetic   cans,   plastic   cans,   bottles   etc.     The   Trial \n\n\nCourt   returned   the   finding   that   firstly   it   was \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                    6</span>\n\n\n\n\nestablished  by the  prosecution that  the deaths  injuries \n\n\nof   the   victims   were   caused   because   of   consumption   of \n\n\nspurious   liquor   with   methyl   alcohol.     The   Trial   Court \n\n\nfurther   recorded   a   finding   that   number   of   the   accused \n\n\npersons   sold   the   same.     The   Sessions   Judge   has   dealt \n\n\nwith  the deaths  of all  the 31  persons and  on the  basis \n\n\nof   the   inquest   report   as   also   the   evidence   of   other \n\n\nwitnesses   came   to   the   conclusion   that   all   these   deaths \n\n\nwere caused due to the drinking of illicit liquor mixed \n\n\nwith   methyl   alcohol.   The   medical   certificates   as   also \n\n\nthe   post-mortem   reports   have   been   meticulously   dealt \n\n\nwith para-wise with the evidence of the witness proving \n\n\nsuch   certificates   as   also   the   evidence   of   the   doctors. \n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1600445\" id=\"span_78\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"767636\" id=\"span_79\">The   Sessions   Judge   then   went   on   to   appreciate   the \n\n\nevidence   of   the   relatives   of   those   persons   who   lost \n\n\ntheir   lives.        The   prosecution   examined   about          33 \n\n\nwitnesses on this question.   The Sessions Judge went on \n\n\nto accept the evidence of all these witnesses regarding \n\n\nthe reason of the death of their kith and kin.

All these \n\n\nwitnesses, number of which is substantial, deposed about \n\n\nthe ill-effects felt after drinking from the shops where \n\n\nliquor provided by A-7 and carried by the other accused \n\n\npersons   like   A-4,   A-8,   A-25   and   A-30,   used   to   be   sold. \n\n\nOn the basis of these witnesses and also on the basis of \n\n\nthe   doctors   who   conducted   the   post-mortem,   the   Trial \n\n\nCourt had no difficulty to arrive at the conclusion that \n\n\ninjuries   suffered   by   persons   including   the   accused   as \n\n\nalso the deaths were occasioned because of the drinking \n\n\nof   the   spurious   and   illicit   liquor.   The   Sessions   Judge \n\n\nultimately gave a finding that it is only after drinking \n\n\nthe  illicit liquor  that the  concerned persons  developed \n\n\nsymptoms characteristics of methanol poisoning.</span></span> \n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">44.    The Sessions judge went on to discuss the evidence \n\n\nregarding   the   conspiracy   of   A-7   with   the   other   accused \n\n\npersons.  For ascertaining the role of A-7, the Sessions \n\n\nJudge   then   referred   to   the   evidence   of   A.   Mohan   (PW-\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_103\">127),   Deputy   Director   of   Income   Tax   (Investigation)   as \n\n\nalso   the   sworn   statements   of   A-7   to   A-15   recorded   on \n\n\n14.10.1999 under <a href=\"/doc/727816/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 131</a> of the Income Tax Act.  The \n\n\nSessions   Judge   on   the   basis   of   all   this   voluminous \n\n\nevidence recorded the finding on the way the business of \n\n\nA-7 was being managed.   His examination and the replies \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                    6</span>\n\n\n\n\ngiven   to   the   various   questions   were   also   considered   by \n\n\nthe   Sessions   Judge   wherein   he   admitted   about   liquor \n\n\nbusiness and his dealing with the Income Tax Department \n\n\nas also the accounts, the huge profits that he made from \n\n\nthis   business.     He   also   accepted   that   his   two   brothers \n\n\nSunil   Dutt   and   Murleedharan   were   his   partners   and   that \n\n\nthe   accounts   were   written   by   Balachandran   (A-15).     It \n\n\nwas   an   admitted   position   that   A-7   was   in   this   business \n\n\nright   from   1984   to   1991   which   he   continued   for   seven \n\n\nyears and thereby started again in 1997-1998 and that A-\n\n\n7   conducted   16   shops   and   his   brothers   conducted   10 \n\n\nshops.     After   dealing   with   the   evidence   regarding   the \n\n\naccounts   as   also   the   various   statements   made   in   the \n\n\nincome   tax   enquiries,   the   Trial   Court   went   on   to \n\n\nappreciate  the other  material regarding  the purchase  of \n\n\nshops.   The   Sessions   Judge   has   then   given   the   complete \n\n\nfinding   regarding   the   business   of   A-7   and   the   other \n\n\naccused.   These  accounts very  significantly include  the \n\n\nmonies   paid   to   the   police   officers   of   various   ranks   as \n\n\nalso   the   excise   officers   and   including.     All   this   was \n\n\nindicated   in   the   accounts   in   the   code   language.     The \n\n\ninternal arrangements of the business with other accused \n\n\npersons   were   also   discussed   and   also   the   financial \n\n\naspects.     He   has   also   discussed   about   he   incriminating \n\n\ncircumstances.     Accused   No.7   had   employed   33   salesmen \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                     6</span>\n\n\n\n\nand   18   toddy   tapers   who   were   members   of   the   Union. \n\n\nAccording to the Sessions Judge these employees used to \n\n\nkeep   away   from   the   business   and   would   only   receive \n\n\nsalary and allowances.   All the toddy collected used to \n\n\nbe  kept in  the godowns  of A-7  which were  raided by  the \n\n\npolice   officers.     The   Session   Judge   then   in   paragraph \n\n\n220 of his judgment has recorded a finding on the basis \n\n\nof   the   documents   and   the   accounts   that   A-7   had \n\n\nmeticulously   managed   his   toddy   business   which   was   of \n\n\nhuge   magnitude.   The   Sessions   Judge   also   recorded   a \n\n\nfinding   that   A-7   made   huge   profits   of   over   9.5   crores \n\n\nwithin   a   span   of   four   months.     By   doing   the   toddy \n\n\nbusiness alone he could not have earned even 1 per cent \n\n\nof   the   bid   amount   of   Rs.4   crores.     The   Sessions   Judge \n\n\nthen   dealt   with   the   properties   including   the   godowns \n\n\nwhich were raided and from where samples were collected. \n\n\nWe   have   discussed   regarding   the   properties   in   the \n\n\nearlier   part   of   the   judgment   and   so   we   need   not   repeat \n\n\nthe same.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_104\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">45.    The Sessions Judge as also referred to the material \n\n\nobjects   found   in   some   of   these   properties   and   has   also \n\n\nreferred   to   the   fact   that   methanol   was   detected   in   the \n\n\nvehicles   found   parked   in   this   plot.     Accused   No.7   was \n\n\nalso found to be frequent purchaser of polythene pouches \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                    6</span>\n\n\n\n\nfrom   the   evidence   of   K.S.   Harish   Kumar   (PW-264),   C.G. \n\n\nPerera (PW-78) and Exhibit P-83 of mahazar.   Similar is \n\n\nthe   evidence   of   Peter   Jacob   (PW-81)   referred   by   the \n\n\nSessions Judge.  The Sessions Judge then referred to the \n\n\nincriminating   articles   seized   from   the   very   premises \n\n\noccupied   by   A-7   analysis   of   which   gave   indication   of \n\n\nnature   of   his   business.              These   premises   include \n\n\nSreekrishna Tabuk Industries. After referring to various \n\n\nsections,   the   Trial   Court   traced   the   role   of   A-7   and \n\n\nother accused persons like A-4.  His vehicles were found \n\n\nto   be   fitted   with   additional   spring   leaves   and   it   was \n\n\nobvious that they were being used for carrying spurious \n\n\nliquor.   The Sessions Judge also recorded Exhibit P-855 \n\n\nand 859 which were search lists and Exhibit P-860 which \n\n\nis the mahazar prepared by him in this regard.   Some of \n\n\nthe   items   seized   by   this   search   list   showed   traces   of \n\n\nmethyl alcohol. Exhibit P-861 was relied upon for this. \n\n\nThe Sessions Judge refuted the contention raised by the \n\n\ncounsel   of   A-7   that   considering   the   scientific \n\n\nproperties of methyl alcohol it was impossible for them \n\n\nto find the trace in some of the vehicles or in the cans \n\n\netc.   as   they   would   have   evaporated.     For   this,   the \n\n\nSessions   Judge   relied   on   evidence   of   PW-233,   Sindhu, \n\n\nAssistant   Director   of   Forensic   Science   Laboratory   who \n\n\nhad   collected   the   trace   evidence.     Her   assertion   that \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                                     6</span>\n\n\n\n\nmethyl alcohol could be traced even after ten days could \n\n\nnot   be   shaken   and   was   rightly   accepted   by   the   Sessions \n\n\nJudge.     Her   evidence   that   methyl   alcohol   was   found   in \n\n\nthe   three   chambers   fitted   in   the   car   bearing \n\n\nregistration   No.   TMY   8748   cannot   be   assailed   on   any \n\n\ncount.  From all this voluminous evidence ultimately the \n\n\nSessions Judge came to the conclusion that A-4, A-8, A-\n\n\n25, 30, and others were the close associates of accused \n\n\nNo.7   and   were   also   involved   in   the   illicit   manufacture \n\n\nand   transport   of   arrack.     The   sessions   Judge   also   held \n\n\nthat   some   accused   were   involved   in   manufacture   of   the \n\n\nillicit   arrack.   We   have   carefully   gone   through   the \n\n\nevidence   referred   to   by   the   Sessions   Judge   and   endorse \n\n\nhis judgment.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_106\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">46.    We   have   deliberately   referred   to   the   judgment   in \n\n\ndetails   as   one   of   the   arguments   by   Shri   Radhakrishnan \n\n\nagainst   the   High   Court&#x27;s   judgment   was   that   the   High \n\n\nCourt   has   dealt   with   the   whole   matter   in   a   perfunctory \n\n\nmanner   and   that   it   has   not   considered   the   findings   by \n\n\nthe   Trial   Court   nor   has   the   High   Court   dealt   with   the \n\n\nmain   objections   raised   in   their   defence.     We   are \n\n\nsatisfied   with   the   judgment   of   the   Trial   Court   insofar \n\n\nas   this   accused   is   concerned   and   the   High   Court   has \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                     7</span>\n\n\n\n\nrightly confirmed the same.

He   has   been   convicted   for   offences \n\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_92\">Sections 324</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_93\">326</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1535430/\" id=\"a_94\">328</a> of the Indian Penal Code \n\n\nas  also for  the offence  under <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_95\">section  57 A  (1) (ii)</a>  of \n\n\nthe   Abkari   Act   and   has   been   sentenced   to   undergo   life \n\n\nimprisonment   along   with   the   fine   of   Rs.50,000/-.     Has \n\n\nalso been separately convicted under Section 57A (1) (i) \n\n\nas  also under  Section 55  (a) (i)  and <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_96\">Section  58</a> of  the \n\n\nAbkari   Act.     His   conviction   insofar   as   offences   under \n\n\nSections   302   and   57A   (1)   (iii)   are   concerned,   the   High \n\n\nCourt   has   set   aside   the   same.     There   is   a   specific \n\n\nfinding in respect of his conviction under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 120B</a> \n\n\nIPC.   The main evidence relied upon by the Courts below \n\n\nagainst   this   accused   is   PW-257,   Mr.   M.   Madhu   who \n\n\nconducted search being search mahajar Exhibit P.135.  It \n\n\nis   the   contention   of   the   prosecution   that   a   search   was \n\n\nconducted   of   a   house   which   was   under   construction   at \n\n\nthat   time   and   it   belonged   to   A-8.     It   is   claimed   that \n\n\nplastic   cans   MO-32   and   MO-39   to   43   vehicles   were   found \n\n\nin   the   premises.     Exhibit   P-782   which   is   the   chemical \n\n\nanalysis   report   suggests   that   traces   of   methyl   alcohol \n\n\nand   ethyl   alcohol   were   detected   in   the   cans   as   also   in \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                      7</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe   samples   taken   from   floor   of   the   vehicles   found \n\n\nparked in the said premises.     The prosecution has come \n\n\nout   with   a   case   that   since   his   house   was   being \n\n\nconstructed,   A-8   took   a   house   in   front   of   this   house, \n\n\nnamely,   Roshini   on   rent.     This   house   was   also   searched \n\n\nand Exhibit P-111 was executed whereby a mono block pump \n\n\nset   and   a   telephone   bill   was   recovered.     Fake   number \n\n\nplates being MOs 83 to 86 were seized from the premises \n\n\nunder   Exhibit   P-191.     Some   of   these   number   plates \n\n\nrelated   to   some   of   the   vehicles   recovered   from   the \n\n\npremises   i.e.   the   plot   where   the   house   was   being \n\n\nconstructed.   Exhibit   P-135   is   the   search   mahazar   and \n\n\nreport relied on in this regard.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_110\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_111\">48.    It is to be understood that A-8 is the real brother \n\n\nof A-7 and it is the contention of the prosecution that \n\n\nA-8   was   fully   involved   in   the   said   business   of   illicit \n\n\nliquor   which   was   headed   by   his   brother,   A-7.   The   High \n\n\nCourt in paragraph 81 of its judgment has held that the \n\n\nevidence   adduced   by   the   prosecution   sufficiently \n\n\nestablished his complicity in the crime.  The High Court \n\n\nhas   also   relied   on   <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_98\">Section   58   A   (5)</a>   of   the   Abkari   Act \n\n\nwhich casts a burden on the accused to prove that he had \n\n\nnot mixed or permitted to be mixed any noxious substance \n\n\nwith   the   liquor.     According   to   the   High   Court   such \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                     7</span>\n\n\n\n\nburden   has   not   been   discharged.     It   was   tried   to   be \n\n\nargued   by   Senior   counsel   Shri   V.   Giri   that   there   is   no \n\n\nveracity   to   the   evidence   relating   to   the   presence   of \n\n\nmethyl   alcohol   in   the   floors   of   the   cars   or   in   the \n\n\nmaterial   objects   found   in   the   search   on   30.10.2000. \n\n\nShri   Giri   further   strenuously   asserted   that   even   if \n\n\nExhibit P-135 and the testimony of PW-257 and PW-253 are \n\n\naccepted   still   the   accused   could   not   have   been   booked \n\n\nfor   offence   under   <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_99\">section   57   A   (1)   (ii)</a>   of   the   Abkari \n\n\nAct.     He   suggested   that   there   is   no   evidence   to   show \n\n\nthat   the   accused   had   either   mixed   or   permitted   to   be \n\n\nmixed any noxious substance.  The learned Senior counsel \n\n\nalso   argued   that   the   accused   must   himself   know   that \n\n\nwhatever   is   being   mixed   with   the   liquor   is   itself   a \n\n\nnoxious substance which has the potential of endangering \n\n\nthe human life and it is only when he mixes it in spite \n\n\nof   the   said   knowledge   then   alone   the   offence   under \n\n\nsection   57A(1)   (ii)   could   be   established.     The   learned \n\n\ncounsel   was   at   pains   to   argue   that   there   is   nothing   to \n\n\nprove   that   A-8   had   any   such   idea   that   methanol   is   a \n\n\nnoxious substance.  The learned counsel then pointed out \n\n\nthat   there   is   no   direct   witness   to   depose   about   the \n\n\nsteps   taken   by   this   accused   for   mixing   methyl   alcohol \n\n\nwith   ethyl   alcohol   or   as   the   case   may   be   toddy   for \n\n\nmaking   Kalapani.     The   learned   counsel   further   argued \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                     7</span>\n\n\n\n\nthat   the   evidence   of   PW-53   is   of   no   consequence   as   it \n\n\ndoes   not   suggest   that   A-8   was   aware   of   the   mixing   for \n\n\nnoxious   substance   like   methyl   alcohol.     He,   therefore, \n\n\nurged that there is no evidence even remotely to connect \n\n\nA-8   with   the   mixing   of   noxious   substance.     Relying   on \n\n\nthe language of Section 57 A(1) (ii) it is the argument \n\n\nthat   it   is   only   where   the   accused   is   a   licencee   under \n\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_100\">Abkari Act</a> and if any noxious substance is detected \n\n\nfrom   any   sample   taken   from   any   of   the   outlets   operated \n\n\nby   him   then   alone   the   burden   of   proving   that   he   had \n\n\nneither mixed nor permitted to be mixed will be that of \n\n\nthe   accused.         However,   in   the   case   like   the   present \n\n\none there would have to be positive evidence to connect \n\n\nthe accused with the actual act of mixing.  According to \n\n\nthe   learned   counsel,   merely   because   methyl   alcohol   was \n\n\ndetected from the traces of evidence collected from the \n\n\ncans and the cars which was seized on 30.10.2000 that by \n\n\nitself could not be sufficient to attract Section 58A(1) \n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_112\">(ii).     It   could   only   indicate   the   involvement   of   the \n\n\naccused in transportation of the noxious substance mixed \n\n\nwith   ethyl   alcohol.     Learned   counsel   further   contended \n\n\nthat   the   evidence   regarding   the   telephone   calls   having \n\n\nbeen   made   from   the   said   number   to   the   house   or   other \n\n\nplaces   belonging   to   or   under   the   control   of   A-7   which \n\n\nthe prosecution sought to prove by producing a telephone \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                     7</span>\n\n\n\n\nbill   in   the   name   of   Shyamala   Kumari   was   also   of   no \n\n\nconsequence.   The learned counsel argued that being the \n\n\nyounger brother of A-7 there is nothing wrong if he made \n\n\ncalls.     The   learned   counsel   further   argued   that   the \n\n\nprosecution   has   relied   on   the   fact   that   the   number \n\n\nplates   were   recovered   from   a   shed   situated   near \n\n\nPandaksala   godown   actually   belonged   to   some   of   the \n\n\nvehicles   which   were   found   in   the   house   under \n\n\nconstruction belonging to A-8.   It has been held by the \n\n\nCourts below that the fact that loose unattached number \n\n\nplates   were   actually   recovered   from   the   godown   and   a \n\n\nshed under the control of A-7 would show that A-8 was an \n\n\nactive participant in the business conducted by A-7 and \n\n\nthat   he   should,   therefore,   be   treated   as   part   of   the \n\n\nconspiracy   allegedly   hatched   by   A-7.     However,   the \n\n\nlearned counsel pointed out that firstly, the disclosure \n\n\nstatement   is   inadmissible   and   secondly,   the   said \n\n\ndiscovery   was   extremely   unnatural   and   artificial.     The \n\n\ncounsel pointed out that even if the said recovery is to \n\n\nthe   accepted   it   would   be   of   no   consequence   insofar   as \n\n\nthe offence under Section 57A (1) (ii) is concerned.  At \n\n\nthe   most,   it   would   show   that   A-8   was   a   participant   in \n\n\nthe   business   and   for   that   A-8   could   be   booked   for   the \n\n\noffence   under   Section   55.     However,   it   will   be   totally \n\n\ninsufficient   for   booking   him   for   the   offence   under \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                                     7</span>\n\n\n\n\nsection 57 A (1) (ii).  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_113\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_114\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"38264736\" id=\"span_91\">Lastly, the learned counsel argued that there is no \n\n\nclear   finding   for   the   complicity   under   <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_101\">Section   120B</a>, \n\n\nIndian   Penal   Code.     According   to   the   learned   senior \n\n\ncounsel   the   gist   of   crime   though   alleged   has   not   been \n\n\nproved   at   all   and   even   if   it   is   presumed   that   accused \n\n\nknew that methyl alcohol was being imported, it will be \n\n\ntoo much to presume that he knew about the mixing of the \n\n\nsame with alcohol.   The learned counsel argued that the \n\n\nagreement   for   the   conspiracy,   as   the   case   may   be,   has \n\n\nnot   been   proved   at   all   and   merely   because   there   is   a \n\n\nburden on the accused under Section 57A (5), that cannot \n\n\nbe   used   for   proving   offence   under   <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_102\">section   120B</a>,   IPC. \n\n\nThe counsel then made extensive comments on the law <a href=\"/doc/1600445/\" id=\"a_103\">laid \n\n\ndown   in</a>  <a href=\"/doc/38264736/\" id=\"a_104\">P.N.

The   learned   counsel   pointed \n\n\nout   that   a   strictly   literal   interpretation   of   the   rule \n\n\nwas   not   possible   because   it   would   virtually   dispense \n\n\nwith any burden on the prosecution to prove the offence. \n\n\nLeaned counsel argued that the initial burden of proving \n\n\nalways would lie on the prosecution which should suggest \n\n\nthe involvement of the accused in mixing of the noxious \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                     7</span>\n\n\n\n\nsubstance.   It  is only  then that  it will  be the  burden \n\n\nof the accused to prove otherwise.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_115\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_116\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"38264736\" id=\"span_93\">49.    We shall now consider all these contentions in the \n\n\nlight   of   the   findings   by   the   Trial   Court   and   the \n\n\nappellate Court.   We have already considered the nature \n\n\nof   burden   of   proof   on   the   prosecution   as   also   on   the \n\n\ndefence   in   the   earlier   part   of   the   judgment   while \n\n\nconsidering   the   case   of   A-7.     The   question   of   said \n\n\nburden   has   been   discussed   thoroughly   in  <a href=\"/doc/38264736/\" id=\"a_105\">Krishna   Lal</a>&#x27;s  \n\n\ncase   (cited   supra).    There   can   be   no   dispute   that   the \n\nprosecution   has   the   initial   burden   to   suggest   that   the \n\n\naccused   person   was   involved   in   the   business   of   illicit \n\n\nliquor and that he knew the nature thereof.   It is only \n\n\nthen that the burden would shift to the accused to prove \n\n\nthat   he   had   no   means   to   know   about   the   nature   of   the \n\n\nbusiness   or   the   fact   that   the   liquor   was   being   mixed \n\n\nwith   noxious   substance   like   methanol.     Now   here   in   the \n\n\npresent case, the accused is the real brother of A-7 and \n\n\nthere are number of other circumstances to suggest that \n\n\nhe was actively engaged in the business.  The High Court \n\n\nas   also   the   Trial   Court   thoroughly   discussed   and \n\n\nconsidered   the   evidence   and   all   the   circumstances \n\n\ntherein.     In   fact   in   the   light   of   these   concurrent \n\n\nfindings,   we   need   not   discuss   the   whole   evidence. \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                     7</span>\n\n\n\n\nHowever,   it   is   clear   from   the   evidence   of   discovery \n\n\nregarding   the   fake   number   plates   that   accused   No.8   was \n\n\nneck deep into the business of spurious liquor.   He was \n\n\nan   active   member   in   carrying   the   said   spurious   liquor \n\n\nand   the   fact   that   a   vehicle   under   his   possession   found \n\n\nfrom   his   premises   had   the   trace   of   methanol   is \n\n\nsufficient   to   hold   that   he   had   the   necessary   knowledge \n\n\nthat methanol played a major part in the business which \n\n\nwas  headed by  his real  brother A-7  and in  which he  was \n\n\nan active partner.   The contentions raised by Shri Giri \n\n\nthat   he   may   at   the   most   be   booked   for   transporting   the \n\n\nspurious   liquor   is   also   not   correct   because   if   that   is \n\n\nestablished   then   his   active   participation   in   the \n\n\nbusiness   also   comes   to   the   forefront.     Thereby   his \n\n\nknowledge that the liquor was being mixed with methanol \n\n\nhas   also   to   be   presumed.       There   was   no   necessity   for \n\n\nkeeping   the   fake   unattached   number   plates   in   his \n\n\npremises   and   the   whole   objective   is   clear   of   shielding \n\n\nthe   cars   by   attaching   fake   number   plates   to   them.     In \n\n\nparagraph  80, the  High Court  thoroughly discussed  about \n\n\nvehicle   PYO1   M   2464   which   was   sold   by   PW-68,   S. \n\n\nVasudevan   and   was   found   in   the   possession   of   this \n\n\naccused.     The   High   Court   has   also   discussed   about   the \n\n\ntransaction   of   his   house,   namely,   Roshini   which   was   in \n\n\nfront   of   the   half   built   house   where   obnoxious   liquor \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                       7</span>\n\n\n\n\ntrade   was   going   on.     He   had   also   taken   a   good   care   to \n\n\nun-authorizedly   obtain   the   telephone   number   620069   from \n\n\nShyamala Kumari, PW-73.  It has referred to the evidence \n\n\nof   PW-260,   Pramod   Kumar   who   had   proved   the   recovery \n\n\nmahazar   Exhibit   P-191.     The   evidence   of   PW-68,   S. \n\n\nVasudevan   was   also   referred   to   by   him.     He   also   urged \n\n\nthat  the house  did not  belong to  A-8.    We have  already \n\n\nreferred to the circumstance that A-8 had taken a house \n\n\nright   in   front   of   the   aforementioned   half   built   house \n\n\nand   it   was   at   his   instance   that   the   real   number   plates \n\n\nof the car which had the traces of methanol were found. \n\n\nWe, therefore, find no reason to discard the evidence of \n\n\nthis discovery.</span>  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_117\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\">50.    As   if   this   was   not   sufficient   according   to   PW-49, \n\n\nS.   Shiju,   who   was   the   driver   of   A-8,   liquor   would   be \n\n\nbrought   from   the   house   of   A-7   in   the   maruti   car   to   be \n\n\ncarried   to   the   places   such   as   Adoor,   Ezhukone   and \n\n\nPathanapuram.     It   is   this   witness   who   established   the \n\n\nnexus   of   A-8   with   the   two   cars   PY01   M   2464   and   PY01   N \n\n\n1014,      MOs 41  and 43,  respectively.    Therefore, it  is \n\n\nobvious that this accused was engaged in the business of \n\n\nmanufacture,  storing, sale  and supply  of illicit  liquor \n\n\nalong with A-7 which resulted in liquor tragedy.   It is \n\n\nobvious   that   this   accused   was   well   aware   of   the   nature \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                     7</span>\n\n\n\n\nof   the   business   as   he   was   thoroughly   into   it. \n\n\nTherefore,   the   offence   under   section   57A   (1)   (i)   and \n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_119\">(ii) as also the other offences under Sections 324, 326 \n\n\nand 328 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 34</a>, IPC have been rightly held \n\n\nproved   against   him.     We   are   not   impressed   with   the \n\n\nargument   of   Shri   Giri   that   the   discovery   was   unnatural \n\n\nand   was   farcical   since   both   the   Courts   have   held   the \n\n\nsaid discovery to have been proved.   Again his frequent \n\n\ncalls to his brother would cut both ways and would also \n\n\nshow that he was actively involved in the business.   As \n\n\nwe   have   already   shown   from   our   earlier   discussion   that \n\n\nit   is   not   necessary   that   the   accused   had   to   mix   or \n\n\npermit   to   be   mixed   the   noxious   substance   himself.     He \n\n\ncould be booked on the same basis as A-7 has been booked \n\n\nby us on the same logic.   Again we are not prepared to \n\n\naccept   the   argument   of   Shri   Giri   that   A-8   had   no   idea \n\n\nthat   methanol   is   a   noxious   substance.     If   a   huge \n\n\nbusiness   was   going   on   and   methanol   was   being   imported \n\n\nalong with ethyl alcohol in huge quantity and if the car \n\n\nwhich   brought   the   methanol   was   in   his   possession   and \n\n\nfurther   if   the   methanol   is   established   to   be   a   noxious \n\n\nsubstance,   it   would   be   a   travesty   to   hold   that   A-8   did \n\n\nnot   know   that   methanol   was   obnoxious   substance.     It   is \n\n\nalso   well   established   that   this   accused   could   be \n\n\nconvicted   with   the   aid   of   <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_107\">Section   120B</a>,   IPC   and   also \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                                            8</span>\n\n\n\n\nindependently of the offence under Section 57 A (1) (ii) \n\n\nas   he   was   not   only   the   part   of   the   business   but   had \n\n\nactively taken part in it.  That by itself is sufficient \n\n\nto   hold   that   he   had   the   knowledge   about   the   mixing   of \n\n\nthe   ethyl   alcohol   with   the   noxious   substance   like \n\n\nmethanol   and   in   spite   of   it,continued.     His   offence \n\n\nwould be covered fully in the phraseology `or permits to  \n\n\nbe mixed&#x27;.  We accordingly, confirm his conviction.  \n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_120\">51.    Shri   Giri   suggested   that   the   chemical   analyzer \n\n\nreport   was   not   put   to   the   accused   and   took   us   through \n\n\nthe   examination   of   the   accused.     In   fact   vide   the \n\n\nquestion   numbers   51,   63,   131,   141,143,   219,   220,   221, \n\n\n224, 263, 691, 692, 706 and 709 and, more particularly, \n\n\nquestion         No.624         all              circumstances         regarding \n\n\nincriminating   circumstances   have   been   put   to   this \n\n\nwitness.

Lastly,   Shri   Giri   also   argued   about   the   sentence \n\n\nand   contended   that   at   the   most   this   accused   could   be \n\n\nbooked   for   the   offence   under   section   55   (g)   and   (h). \n\n\nThere   can   be   no   doubt   that   he   can   be   booked   for   those \n\n\noffences,   however,   in   our   opinion,   the   Trial   Court   and \n\n\nthe appellate Court have not committed any illegality in \n\n\nbooking   him   under   section   57A   (1)   (ii)   also. \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                                      8</span>\n\n\n\n\nConsidering   the   number   of   deaths   caused   on   account   of \n\n\nthe business in which this accused was neck deep, we do \n\n\nnot   think   that   any   leniency   can   be   shown.       We \n\n\naccordingly dismiss the appeal of A-8.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_123\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_124\">53.    This   takes   us   to   the   case   of   A-4,   who   is   another \n\n\nbrother of A-7 and A-8.  In fact the part played by A-4, \n\n\nManikantan @ Kochani is not less than the part played by \n\n\nA-8, if not more.   His connection with the business and \n\n\nA-7   is   deposed   by   A.   Raju   (PW-40),   an   auto   rickshaw \n\n\ndriver  who had  seen A-4  coming out  of the  house of  A-1 \n\n\nin a red maruti car.  His business connections have been \n\n\ndeposed to by M.M. Ibrahim (PW-65) and it is proved from \n\n\nthe   evidence   of   PW-37   that   he   also   arranged   for   the \n\n\nfinance of Rs. 30 lakhs at the instance of A-1.   He was \n\n\nalso   identified   by   S.   Dharmapalan   (PW-36)   as   a   person \n\n\ngoing   to   the   house   of   A-1   with   spirit   in   car.     It   is \n\n\nvery   important   to   note   here   that   appeal   by   A-1   has \n\n\nabated on account of her death.  It was A-1, who was the \n\n\nretail   distributor   of   liquor.     Allegedly   her   shop   was \n\n\nfor   sale   of   toddy   but   it   has   come   in   evidence   that \n\n\nliquor used to be supplied from her house.   Few injured \n\n\nwitnesses   have   been   examined   who   were   the   customers   of \n\n\nliquor saying that on the fateful day the liquor tested \n\n\na little different.   PW-53 in his evidence specifically \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                                      8</span>\n\n\n\n\ninvolved   this   accused   suggesting   that   the   methanol   was \n\n\nfirst brought in the plastic vessels and then mixed with \n\n\nspirit   kept   in   the   tank   and   thereafter   it   was   supplied \n\n\nfor   sale.     He   specifically   stated   that   this   was   done \n\n\nunder   the   leadership   of   A-4   along   with   few   others.     He \n\n\nhas   specifically   deposed   that   on   the   fateful   day,   MO24 \n\n\ncar  came to  the godown  of A-7  between 10  to 11  O&#x27;clock \n\n\nin   the   morning   and   that   was   being   driven   by   Anil   Kumar \n\n\nA-16.  He further deposed that the essence i.e. methanol \n\n\nwas   filled   in   10   plastic   vessels   and   they   were   kept \n\n\ninside the godown. At that time, probably ethyl alcohol \n\n\nhad   not   come   and   it   was   told   to   them   that   spirit   load \n\n\nwould come.  He further deposed that the tanker of ethyl \n\n\nalcohol   came   at   about   11   O&#x27;   clock   in   the   night,   the \n\n\ndriver   of   which   was   Shakthi   from   Tamil   Nadu.     It   was \n\n\nthen mixed by the workers of A-4 with the ethyl alcohol. \n\n\nHe then suggested that the liquor was then dispatched in \n\n\nthree   vehicles   to   the   dealers   at   Attukadavu   and \n\n\nPulimuttukadavu.     Even   after   the   tragedy   happened,   he \n\n\ndeposed   about   the   operations   to   destroy   the   spurious \n\n\nliquor.     In   the   cross   examination   at   the   instance   of \n\n\nthis   accused,   beyond   putting   an   innocuous   suggestion \n\n\nthat   he   was   telling   lies,   there   was   nothing   much.   The \n\n\naccused   was   tried   to   be   painted   as   the   chief   link   of \n\n\nKayamkulam  lobby to  which he  specifically answered  that \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                     8</span>\n\n\n\n\nit was Anil Kumar who used to do the same.  This accused \n\n\nwas also involved by V. Harikumar (PW-167) who also knew \n\n\nthis   accused   along   with   four   other   accused   persons   who \n\n\nwere the driver of A-4.  According to this witness, they \n\n\nused   to   purchase   flowers   to   put   in   their   cars.     S. \n\n\nVasudeven   (PW-68)   who   is   the   vehicle   broker   also \n\n\nrecognized   A-4,   A-7   and   A-8   and   deposed   that   he   had \n\n\neffected   sale   of   the   car   to   A-8   and   arranged   two   cars \n\n\nfor the manager of A-7.  However, the money for all this \n\n\nwas   provided   by   A-4.     The   High   Court   has   also   referred \n\n\nto   the   evidence   of   T.   Shyjan   (PW-173)   an   accomplice   to \n\n\nshow   the   involvement   of   A-4.   Even   Usha   (PW-62)   spoke \n\n\nabout the adjacent building being rented out in the name \n\n\nof A-4.   The search list Exhibit P-112 which was proved \n\n\nand produced by PW-270, various articles were seized and \n\n\nsamples   collected   showed   the   ethyl   alcohol   and   methyl \n\n\nalcohol   which   fact   got   proved   by   Exhibit   P-782.     These \n\n\nobjects   were   MO-26   four   blue   cans   and   MO-27,   12   white \n\n\ncans.     He   along   with   his   brother   raised   loans   from \n\n\nChirayinkil   Service   Cooperative   Society,   obviously   for \n\n\nrunning   the   business   along   with   A-7.   He   stood   as   a \n\n\nguarantor   for   A-7.     Exhibits   P-74   (d)   (e)   (f)   (g)   (h) \n\n\nwere   proved   for   that   purpose.     The   High   Court   has \n\n\ndiscussed   about   his   house   properties   from   where   number \n\n\nof  cans were  seized.    It has  also come  in the  evidence \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                     8</span>\n\n\n\n\nthat   the   samples   collected   from   the   floor   of   these \n\n\nbuildings   showed   the   presence   of   methanol.   Thus,   it   is \n\n\nclear   that   this   witness   was   thoroughly   in   the   business \n\n\nlike his brothers A-7 and A-8.   It is, therefore, clear \n\n\nthat this was nothing but a conspiracy to run a patently \n\n\nillegal business along with his two brothers and others. \n\n\nIt   was   argued   by   Shri   Dave   that   the   case   against   this \n\n\nappellant   stands   on   the   same   footing   as   A-5   and   A-11 \n\n\nand,   therefore,   he   deserved   to   be   given   the   same \n\n\npunishment.   We  do not  agree.    A-5 and  A-11 along  with \n\n\nA-6   and   A-10   are   proved   to   have   physically   transported \n\n\nthe   mixed   substance   to   various   places.     However,   they \n\n\nare not the persons who took active part in the business \n\n\nas its proprietors as A-4 did.   In fact A-4 was at the \n\n\nhelm   of   the   affairs   unlike   those   accused   who   merely \n\n\ntransported the liquor.   The case of A-4, therefore, is \n\n\nquite different.   It was argued that he himself had not \n\n\ntransported   the   noxious   substance   which   was   done   by   A-\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">15.  That may not be so, but he was practically managing \n\n\nthe  whole show.   It  has rightly  been held  by the  Trial \n\n\nCourt   and   the   appellate   court   that   A-5   was   a   worker   of \n\n\nA-4   and   took   active   part   in   the   transportation   of \n\n\nmethanol.     We   do   not   accept   the   argument   of   Shri   Dave \n\n\nthat  his case  was comparable  to that  of A-5  and such  a \n\n\ncontention   has   rightly   not   been   accepted   by   the   trial \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                      8</span>\n\n\n\n\nand   the   appellate   Court.     His   involvement   in   the \n\n\nbusiness   is   so   deep   that   it   was   clear   that   he   was   a \n\n\nconspirator   and   it   was   in   pursuance   of   conspiracy   that \n\n\nthe whole liquor business which essentially involved the \n\n\nmixing   of   methanol   with   the   ethyl   alcohol   was   being \n\n\nconducted.  Shri Dave tried to dub the evidence of PW-53 \n\n\nas   a   general   evidence   which   argument   does   not   impress \n\n\nus.   We have already commented upon the evidence of PW-\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_126\">53.  \n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">54.    Shri   Dave   then   dubbed   Section   57A   as   a   draconian \n\n\npiece   of   legislation.     Relying   on   the   language   of   the \n\n\nwhole   section,   Shri   Dave   contended   like   the   other \n\n\nlearned   counsels   that   the   act   of   mixing   the   noxious \n\n\nsubstance   has   to   be   proved   for     being   punished   under \n\n\nthis   section.     We   have   already   commented   upon   the   real \n\n\nimport   of   <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_108\">Section   57A</a>   of   the   Abkari   Act.     The   language \n\n\nof   Section   57   A   (1)   is   wide   enough   as   we   have   already \n\n\ncommented   in   the   earlier   part   of   the   judgment   and   A-4 \n\n\nwill   fit   in   the   broad   language.     Shri   Dave   argued   that \n\n\nthe   section   does   not   use   the   word   `knowledge&#x27;   or \n\n\n`knowingly&#x27;.  He also argued that mens rea to be read in \n\n\nall the offences unless the legislature has expressly or \n\n\nby   necessary   implications   excluded  mens   rea  as   the \n\n\ningredient of offence.   Reading the language of Section \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                     8</span>\n\n\n\n\n57 A (1) as it is, it is more than proved that all these \n\n\naccused   persons   entered   into   a   conspiracy   to   do   the \n\n\nillegal liquor business and in order to succeed in their \n\n\nbusiness,   took   recourse   to   mixing   methanol   with   ethyl \n\n\nalcohol   and   brought   out   a   new   type   of   spurious   liquor. \n\n\nIn   order   to   increase   the   potency   of   the   drink   and   in \n\n\norder   to   probably   give   taste,   they   mixed   the   methanol. \n\n\nOnce   ethyl   alcohol   is   proved   to   be   a   noxious   drug,   if \n\n\nthey   are   found   to   be   mixing   or   permitting   mixing \n\n\nmethanol   with   ethyl   alcohol   then   the   offence   would   be \n\n\ncomplete   whether   they   had   the   knowledge   regarding   the \n\n\nqualities   of   methanol   or   not.     That   is   apart   from   the \n\n\nfact   that   in   this   case   itself   to   say   that   the   accused \n\n\ndid   not   know   about   the   properties   of   methanol   would   be \n\n\nwrong.     If   that   had   been   so   they   would   not   have   been \n\n\nrunning   between   Hosur   and   Kerala   to   bring   methanol   in \n\n\nthe cars which had fake registration numbers and secrete \n\n\nchambers.   As   many   as   7   reported   decisions   were   relied \n\n\nupon by Shri Dave for the question of mens rea.  We have \n\n\nnothing  against the  principles laid  down thereunder  but \n\n\nwe must point out that in none of the seven cases relied \n\n\nupon   by   the   learned   counsel   the   case   related   to   an \n\n\noffence like Section 57 A (1).   The whole discussion on \n\n\nmens   rea,   therefore,   is   of   no   consequence.     The \n\n\nfollowing cases were relied on:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_128\">\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                     8</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">   1) Lim Chin Aik v.

There   can   be   no   question   about   the   absence   of \n\n\nconspiracy.  The whole business itself was a conspiracy. \n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_129\">It   may   not   be   the   conspiracy   to   mix   the   noxious \n\n\nsubstance but the fact of the matter is that in order to \n\n\nsucceed   in   the   business   which   itself   was   a   conspiracy \n\n\nthey   mixed   or   allowed   to   be   mixed   methanol   and   used   it \n\n\nso   freely   that   ultimately   31   persons   lost   their   lives. \n\n\nWe   are   not   at   all   impressed   by   the   argument   regarding \n\n\nknowledge.   Shri Dave also referred to the case of  P.N.  \n\n\nKrishna   Lal   (cited   supra).    The   argument   was   that   if \n\nSection   57A   (v)   is   to   be   worked   out   in   its   literal \n\n\nmanner   then   it   is   the   defence   which   would   lead   the \n\n\nevidence   of   disproving.     The   argument   is   clearly \n\n\nincorrect.  We have already explained the responsibility \n\n\non the prosecution in the earlier part of the judgment. \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                     8</span>\n\n\n\n\nIn our view, in this case the prosecution has discharged \n\n\nits   primary   burden.           The   accused   persons,   more \n\n\nparticularly,  these three  brothers have  not offered  any \n\n\nevidence so as to discharge the burden put against them \n\n\nunder section 57A (1) (v).  In this case the prosecution \n\n\nhas   clearly   proved   that   there   was   a   noxious   substance \n\n\nwhich was likely to endanger the human life.   Secondly, \n\n\nthey have proved that substance was mixed, permitted to \n\n\nbe mixed and was being regularly mixed with liquor. They \n\n\nhave   thirdly   proved   that   the   persons   mixing   had   the \n\n\nknowledge   that   methanol   was   a   dangerous   substance   that \n\n\naspect   would   be   clear   from   the   fact   that   after   the \n\n\ntragedy   A-7   went   and   punished   his   servants   and \n\n\nremonstrated   them   for   `not   properly&#x27;  mixing   methanol \n\n\nwith   ethyl   alcohol.     Lastly,   it   is   proved   that   as   a \n\n\nresult   of   mixing   of   methanol   with   the   liquor   and   as   a \n\n\nresult   of   consuming   such   liquor   as   many   as   31   persons \n\n\nlost their lives and number of others suffered grievous \n\n\ninjuries.   We reject the argument of Shri Dave that the \n\n\ninitial   burden   was   not   proved   by   the   prosecution   which \n\n\nwe   confirm   the   finding   of   conviction   and   sentence   as \n\n\nimposed   against   A-4.         We   accordingly   dismiss   the \n\n\nappeal filed by A-4.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_130\">\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                                     8</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_131\">56.    This takes us to the SLP (Crl.) 842 of 2006 of A-25 \n\n\nrepresented   by   senior   Counsel   Shri   Shekhar   in   which   we \n\n\nhave   granted   leave   to   appeal.     The   argument   of   learned \n\n\nsenior counsel was almost on the same lines with that of \n\n\nShri   Dave   and   Shri   Giri   insofar   as   the   contentions \n\n\nregarding the burden of proof and the interpretation of \n\n\nSection  57 A  (1) were  concerned.    It is  well proved  by \n\n\nthe prosecution that this A-25 was a major link used to \n\n\npurchase  liquor from  A-4 and  he was  the one  to used  to \n\n\ndistribute   the   same.     Learned   counsel   argued   that   this \n\n\naccused   had   no   control   over   this   business   and   he   was \n\n\nmerely   transporting   the   spurious   liquor   and,   therefore, \n\n\nhe should have been booked under section 57 A (1) (iii). \n\n\n\nA-25   was   selling   liquor   in   retail   through   A-32,   A-35 \n\n\netc.   A-25  and A-10  were the  employees of  A-4 who  were \n\n\nsupplying the liquor to A-21.   Thus, he was getting the \n\n\nreadymade   liquor.           As   per   the   evidence   of   P. \n\n\nThulaseedharan   (PW-131),   because   of   the   liquor   sold   to \n\n\nhis   father   on   21.10.2000   at   11   pm   that   his   father   was \n\n\nadmitted in the hospital.  Name of the father is Pachan. \n\n\nIn  fact, as  per the  evidence of  PW-131, he  was told  by \n\n\nhis   father   that   he   had   consumed   little   from   the   liquor \n\n\nentrusted to him by A-24 for sale.   Thereafter, he felt \n\n\nheadache   and   abdominal   pain.     The   prosecution   suggests \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                     9</span>\n\n\n\n\nthat later on he died.   As per the evidence of P. Ramu \n\n\n(PW-163),   his   father   used   to   drink   the   liquor   supplied \n\n\nby   A-25   and   he   had   also   seen   on   the   fateful   day,   his \n\n\nfather   consuming   alcohol   supplied   by   A-25.     Thus,   his \n\n\nfather   who   died   was   himself   a   further   supplier   of   the \n\n\ndrink,   which   was   used   to   be   supplied   by   A-25.     The \n\n\nliquor   sold   on   that   day   tasted   differently,   which   was \n\n\nthe evidence of M. Ponappan (PW-133).   He had, however, \n\n\npurchased the liquor from A-32.   When he enquired about \n\n\nthe   reason,   he   was   told   that   it   was   liquor   of   A-7 \n\n\nbrought   through   A-25.     Evidence   of   T.   Chandrasekhara \n\n\nBabu   (PW-146)   is   also   to   the   same   tune.     PW-173   is \n\n\nanother   witness   who   is   an   accomplice.     He   claimed   to \n\n\nhave   known   A-25.     He   was   used   to   be   given   a   canister \n\n\nwhenever he became indebted.   He used to sell 35 litres \n\n\nof   liquor   in   that   canister.     Thus,   it   is   established \n\n\nthat   A-25   used   to   take   the   liquor   manufactured   by   A-7 \n\n\nand the same used to be supplied to him by A-4 and the \n\n\nsame   was   distributed   by   him   further.     Obviously,   this \n\n\nwitness   used   to   sell   the   liquor   supplied   by   A-25   at   a \n\n\nhigher   price   of   Rs.20/-   per   litre   and   he   purchased   the \n\n\nliquor from A-25 twice or thrice in a week.   It was for \n\n\nthe last time that he purchased the liquor from A-25 on \n\n\n20.10.2000   as   he   told   that   he   waited   near   Pallikkal \n\n\ntemple near milma booth and after 10 or 15 minutes, A-5 \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                    9</span>\n\n\n\n\nand   A-25   came   there   in   a   blue   Maruti   Car   and   five \n\n\ncanisters   of   liquor   were   unloaded   there.     It   was \n\n\ndistributed amongst A-24, A-6, A-29 and A-28.  It was A-\n\n\n25 who asked A-32 to destroy the balance of liquor after \n\n\nthe tragedy.  The prosecution alleged, as the High Court \n\n\nhas   noted,   that   he   absconded   and   he   was   arrested   from \n\n\nK.S.R.T.C.   Bus   stand   on   11.12.2000.     The   Trial   Court \n\n\nthoroughly   discussed   his   evidence.     It   was   contended \n\n\nbefore the Trial Court that evidence of PW-173 could not \n\n\nbe accepted as he was given pardon only towards the fag \n\n\nend of the case. The Trial Court and the High Court have \n\n\nfound   nothing   wrong   with   the   grant   of   pardon   under \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/122405/\" id=\"a_111\">Sections 306</a> and <a href=\"/doc/647828/\" id=\"a_112\">307</a> of the Cr.P.C.  The Trial Court has \n\n\ncorrectly   appreciated   the   legal   position   that   evidence \n\n\nof   PW-173   could   not   be   accepted   unless   it   is \n\n\ncorroborated by other witnesses.   A finding is recorded \n\n\nthat the evidence of PW-173 was corroborated by PWs-131, \n\n\n133   and   163   insofar   as   the   role   played   by   A-25   is \n\n\nconcerned.   Thus,  the sale  on the  part of  A-25 and  his \n\n\nactive participation in the business run by A-4 and A-7 \n\n\nwas   clearly   brought   out.     He   was   convicted   for   the \n\n\noffence   under   Sections   57A(2)(i)   and   was   heavily   fined \n\n\nfor Rs.50,000/-, Rs.25,000/- and Rs.2 lakhs on different \n\n\ncounts  including Section  55(a)(i) as  also under  <a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_113\">Section \n\n\n58</a> of the Abkari Act.   He was, thus, in a position for \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                     9</span>\n\n\n\n\ndistributors   and   it   has   come   out   in   the   evidence   that \n\n\nthe   liquor   sold   by   sub-distributors   killed   number   of \n\n\npersons.  The sub-distributors were none, but A-37, A-35 \n\n\nand   A-41.     It   was   the   chain   of   distribution   of   liquor \n\n\nmixed with methyl alcohol.  It is obvious that he was in \n\n\npossession   of   the   poisoned   liquor   and   does   not   seem   to \n\n\nhave   taken   care   that   it   was   not   mixed   with   methyl \n\n\nalcohol.   It was urged by the learned counsel appearing \n\n\nthat there was no evidence on record to suggest that A-\n\n\n25   had   anything   to   do   with   the   mixing   of   the   methylene \n\n\nwith   the   liquor.     It   was   suggested   that   he   had   no \n\n\ncontrol over the operation and he was a mere distributor \n\n\nand  sold the  liquor as  he received  from A-4.   There  is \n\n\nno doubt that this accused was acquitted of the offence \n\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 120B</a>, IPC by the Trial Court and there is \n\n\nno appeal against it.  The conviction of this accused is \n\n\nfor offence punishable under Section 57A(2) and on that \n\n\naccount,   he   has   been   awarded   life   imprisonment.     Shri \n\n\nV.Shekhar,   learned   senior   counsel   contended   that   since \n\n\nthis witness was not a conspirator and had nothing to do \n\n\nwith   the   business   of   A-7   and   was   merely   a   distributor, \n\n\nthe   sentence   of   life   imprisonment   is   excessive.     As \n\n\nagainst this, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf \n\n\nof   the   State   contended   that   this   accused   cannot   escape \n\n\nthe conviction under Section 57A(2).  The learned senior \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                      9</span>\n\n\n\n\ncounsel   urged   that   if   this   accused   was   selling   the \n\n\nliquor,   then   it   was   for   him   to   take   the   reasonable \n\n\nprecaution   to   see   that   the   liquor   that   he   sells   is   not \n\n\nmixed   with   toxic   substance.     There   can   be   no   dispute \n\n\nthat   this   witness   had   no   control   over   the   business   run \n\n\nby A-7 and, therefore, he was rightly acquitted for the \n\n\noffence   under   <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_115\">Section   120B</a>,   IPC   i.e.   conspiracy. \n\n\nHowever,   it   cannot   be   said   that   his   conviction   under \n\n\nSection 57A(2) is incorrect on that count.  We also find \n\n\nfrom the evidence of P.S. John (PW-252) that there was a \n\n\nsearch   in   the   house   of   this   accused   on   23.10.2010   vide \n\n\nExhibit   P-803   and   a   bottle   was   seized   which   was   mixed \n\n\nwith   ethyl   and   methyl.     This   was   substantiated   by \n\n\nChemical   Analysis   Report   (Exhibit   P-784).     He   was   also \n\n\nin   possession   of   pure   methyl   alcohol,   which   is \n\n\nsubstantiated by Exhibit P-417, a disclosure made by him \n\n\nto   M.G.   Manilal   (PW-269)   as   per   Exhibit   P-1019.     Even \n\n\nthis   was   found   to   be   methyl   alcohol.     Once   this   fact \n\n\nregarding the possession of methyl alcohol is proved, A-\n\n\n25   cannot   argue   that   the   possession   of   methyl   alcohol \n\n\nwas   only   incidental.     There   is   no   reason   for   keeping \n\n\nmethyl alcohol with him.  After all, he was not going to \n\n\nuse it as a deodorant or perfume.  This may suggest that \n\n\nhe had a hand in mixing the alcohol with methyl alcohol, \n\n\nbut   there   is   no   evidence   for   that   and   he   has   not   been \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                     9</span>\n\n\n\n\nconvicted   for   the   offence   under   Section   57A(1).     The \n\n\nwords &quot;omits to take reasonable precaution&quot; would cast a \n\n\nduty on him to see that the liquor that he sells is not \n\n\nmixed   with   poisonous   substance.     Again,   under   sub-\n\n\nSection   (5)   of   Section   57A,   he   was   bound   to   prove   that \n\n\nhe   had   taken   reasonable   precaution,   as   contemplated   in \n\n\nsub-Section   (2).     There   is   no   evidence   to   the   contrary \n\n\nnor has the accused discharged his burden in any manner. \n\n\nIn   our   opinion,   therefore,   his   conviction   for   offence \n\n\npunishable  under Section  57A(2) is  justified.    However, \n\n\nwe   agree   with   Shri   V.   Shekhar,   learned   senior   counsel, \n\n\nwho   suggests   that   he   should   not   be   punished   with   life \n\n\nimprisonment.     We   find   that   this   accused   is   convicted \n\n\nfor   offence   punishable   under   Section   55   as   also   under \n\n\nSection 58, the maximum punishment for which Section is \n\n\n10 years and that he has already undergone more than 10 \n\n\nyears   of   imprisonment.     The   statement   made   by   the \n\n\nlearned   senior   counsel   that   the   accused   had   undergone \n\n\nmore   than   10   years   of   imprisonment   was   not   seriously \n\n\ncontroverted.     In   our   view,   therefore,   this   accused \n\n\nshould have been dealt with not at par with A-7, A-4 and \n\n\nA-8   at   least   insofar   as   the   punishment   is   concerned. \n\n\nWe,   therefore,   deem   it   fit   while   confirming   his \n\n\nconviction   for   the   other   offences   and   the   sentences \n\n\ntherefor   to   bring   down   the   sentence   from   life \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                     9</span>\n\n\n\n\nimprisonment to what is undergone by him (relying on the \n\n\nstatement   made   by   the   learned   senior   counsel   that   the \n\n\naccused   has   undergone   more   than   10   years   of \n\n\nimprisonment).     Insofar   as   the   punishment   of   fine   is \n\n\nconcerned, we do not interfere and confirm the sentence \n\n\nof fines.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_132\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_133\">57.    We   accordingly   dismiss   his   appeal   with   the \n\n\nmodification in the sentence as indicated.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_134\">58.    This   takes   us   to   the   Criminal   Appeal   No.   1531   of \n\n\n2005   filed   by   A-30.     His   case   more   or   the   less   is \n\n\nidentical   with   Suresh   (A-25).     As   per   the   prosecution \n\n\nversion, this accused had filled the liquor supplied by \n\n\nA-4   through   A-5   and   A-10   in   covers   and   on   the   fateful \n\n\nnight on 20.10.2000, he carried the same in Car bearing \n\n\nregistration No. PT01M 8122 to the residence of A-39 and \n\n\nshe,   in   turn,   sold   the   same   to   the   customers.     It   is \n\n\nironical   that   A-39   herself   also   consumed   liquor   and \n\n\ndied,   so   also   one   Soman   Pilai   and   several   others   had \n\n\nsustained   injuries.     The   evidence   of   PW-153   is   clear \n\n\nenough,   who   complained   that   the   liquor   was   found   to   be \n\n\nstronger   and   when   he   asked   what   the   matter   was,   it   was \n\n\npressed   by   A-39   that   the   liquor   was   supplied   by   A-30. \n\n\nIn fact, as per the evidence of a. Gopi (PW-153), he had \n\n\nhimself found A-30 bringing the liquor.   Similar is the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                    9</span>\n\n\n\n\nevidence   of   N.   Prasad   (PW-154)   who   felt   uneasy   after \n\n\ndrinking the liquor at 12 in the noon on 20.10.2000.  He \n\n\nwas   required   to   be   hospitalized.     Even   he   has   deposed \n\n\nthat A-39 used to sell the liquor which was supplied to \n\n\nher by A-30 and A-31.  He has also seen the liquor being \n\n\nsupplied.     In   fact,   he   also   spoke   about   the   happenings \n\n\non 20.10.2000.   G. Raghavan Pillai (PW-164), the father \n\n\nof   A-39   had   also   consumed   the   liquor   and   he   also \n\n\nsuffered.     He   also   established   the   connection   of   A-30. \n\n\nThus, there is enough evidence to establish that on the \n\n\nfateful   day,   A-30   accompanied   by   A-31   supplied   three \n\n\nbundles of covers, each having 100 covers.   He has made \n\n\na   disclosure   statement   that   alcohol   was   poured   in   the \n\n\ncloset of a latrine recently constructed on the eastern \n\n\nside of the Senior Orthodox Church.   The liquid in this \n\n\ncloset   which   was   having   smell   of   liquor   was   collected \n\n\nand it was established that it contained methyl alcohol. \n\n\nM.O.   256   is   the   sample   while   Exhibit   P1001   is   the \n\n\nchemical  analysis report.   One  Badaruddin (PW-172)  also \n\n\nspoke   about   the   role   played   by   A-30   who   purchased   the \n\n\nnew   car   under   hire   purchase   agreement.     This   was   none \n\n\nelse   but   car   bearing   registration   No.   PT01M   8122.     He \n\n\nalso discovered a sealing machine from the residence of \n\n\none   Sukumaran   (PW-181).     M.O.   97   was   that   sealing \n\n\nmachine,   which   seizure   was   proved   by   S.   Bhaskaran   (PW-\n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                                     9</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_135\">175).  This accused offered himself as a defence witness \n\n\nand   admitted   therein   that   the   car   was   owned   by   him   and \n\n\nsince there was default in payment of the hire purchase \n\n\ninstallments, the car was seized by the financer.  It is \n\n\nfound   by   the   High   Court   that   his   house   was   near   to \n\n\nSenior   Orthodox   Church   near   to   rubber   plantation.     He \n\n\nclaimed   that   he   was   made   accused   because   of   the \n\n\npolitical enmity.  There can be no dispute that there is \n\n\nenough   evidence   to   show   that   A-30   was   involved   in   the \n\n\nprocurement   of   liquor   from   A-4.     He   then   packed   it   in \n\n\nthe covers and supplied to A-39.  The High Court has not \n\n\nfound him guilty under Section 304 or <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 307</a>, IPC. \n\n\nInstead, the High Court has booked him for offence under \n\n\nSection   57A(2)(ii),   Section   55(a),   (h)   and   (i)   and \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/21887562/\" id=\"a_117\">Section   58</a>   of   the   Abkari   Act.     Ms.   Malini,   learned \n\n\ncounsel  very earnestly  urged that  his conviction  should \n\n\nnot be maintained under Section 57A(2)(ii) as he did not \n\n\nhave   knowledge   and   he   was   not   concerned   with   the \n\n\npreparation   of   the   spurious   liquor.     We   reject   the \n\n\ncontention on the same reasoning that we have given for \n\n\nrejecting the similar contentions raised on behalf of A-\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_136\">25.     The   role   played   by   both   is   almost   the   same.     We \n\n\nalso   reject   the   contention   raised   that   he   could   have \n\n\nbeen   booked   only   under   Sections   55(a),   (h)   and   (i)   and \n\n\nalso   under   Section   58.     The   learned   counsel   has   also \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                                     9</span>\n\n\n\n\nprayed for leniency.   For the same reasons that we have \n\n\ngiven   in   respect   of   A-25,   we   take   the   same   view   in \n\n\nrespect of this accused also.   The learned counsel made \n\n\na   statement   that   this   accused   was   also   behind   the   bars \n\n\nfor   more   than   10   years,   which   contention   was   not \n\n\nseriously   disputed   by   Shri   J.C.   Gupta,   learned   counsel \n\n\nappearing   on   behalf   of   the   Government.     We,   therefore, \n\n\nset   aside   his   life   imprisonment   and   bring   down   the \n\n\nsentence   to   what   has   been   undergone.     We   accordingly \n\n\ndismiss   the   appeal   filed   by   A-30   with   the   modification \n\n\nin the sentence as indicated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_137\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_138\">59.    Before   we   part   with   this   case,   we   must   note   some \n\n\nvery disturbing facts which have been revealed from the \n\n\nvoluminous   evidence   by   the   prosecution.     Here   was   a \n\n\nperson   who   was   unabashedly   running   his   empire   of \n\n\nspurious liquor trade and for that purpose had purchased \n\n\npoliticians including the public representatives, police \n\n\nofficers   and   other   officers   belonging   to   the   Excise \n\n\nDepartment.           The   trade   was   going   unabated. \n\n\nUnfortunately,   it   is   the   elite   of   the   society   or   the \n\n\n&quot;haves&quot;   of   the   society   who   never   purchase   this   kind   of \n\n\nspurious liquor for the obvious reasons.  It is only the \n\n\npoor   section   of   the   society   which   becomes   the   prey   of \n\n\nsuch obnoxious trade and ultimately suffers.  As many as \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                     9</span>\n\n\n\n\n31   persons   have   lost   their   lives,   about   5   or   more \n\n\npersons   have   lost   their   eye-site   forever   and   several \n\n\nothers   have   suffered   in   their   health   on   account   of   the \n\n\ninjuries caused to them.  It is only by an accident that \n\n\nthe   mixing   was   not   done   properly   on   the   fateful   day   in \n\n\nthe sense that the liquor mixed did prove to be fatal or \n\n\ninjurious.   But that does not mean when it was mixed on \n\n\nother day for months together that it was not injurious. \n\n\nThe   use   of   methanol   was   a   dangerous   proposition.     It \n\n\nonly   shows   that   the   human   avarice   could   create   hell   in \n\n\nGod&#x27;s   own   country   Kerala.   We   are   not   only   perturbed   by \n\n\nthe enormousness of the tragedy but the enormousness of \n\n\nthe  liquor trade  run by  A-7 and  that was  under the  so-\n\n\ncalled   vigilant   eyes   of   those   who   had   duty   to   stop   it. \n\n\nThe   avarice   is   not   only   on   the   part   of   the   accused \n\n\npersons, but also on the part of those who benefit from \n\n\nthis   horrible   business.     Though   10   years   have   passed, \n\n\nthe reverberations of this grin tragedy have not become \n\n\nsilent.     We   hope   and   expect   that   the   Kerala   Government \n\n\ntakes   up   this   issue   and   takes   definite   steps   for \n\n\noverhauling the system.  We are worried about the rotten \n\n\nsystem that allowed such trade not only to continue, but \n\n\nto   thrive.          It   will   be,   therefore,   for   the \n\n\nadministrators   and   the   Government   to   take   positive \n\n\nsteps,   firstly,   to   overhaul   the   system   by   weeding   out \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                     1</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe corrupts by punishing those who are responsible for \n\n\nthe whole system looking sideways.  We do not know as to \n\n\nwhether such an exercise is taken up, but if it has not \n\n\nbeen   taken   up   the   government   is   directed   to   take   such \n\n\nsteps.  We do not think that the things would come under \n\n\ncontrol unless such exercise is taken, so as to save the \n\n\npoor man from such ghastly disaster.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_140\">60.
