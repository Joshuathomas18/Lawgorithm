The facts are that a typed report was lodged by Mohan Rajak,  Deputy\nSuperintendent of Police (East), Muzaffarpur (for short  ‘the  informant’)\non  05.12.1994  at  22.10  hours  (10.10  p.m.)  at  PS  Sadar,   District\nMuzaffarpur (East), which was treated as FIR.  The prosecution case in the\nFIR briefly was as follows: On the night of  04.12.1994,  certain  unknown\ncriminals had murdered Shri Kaushlendra Kumar Shukla @ Chhotan Shukla  and\nhis associates at NH-28 and the post mortem  on  Chhotan  Shukla  and  the\nother deceased persons was done on 05.12.1994 at the SKM College Hospital.\n The supporters of Chhotan Shukla belonging to  the  Bihar  Peoples  Party\ngathered in large numbers at the hospital.  Considering the possibility of\nbreakdown of  law  and  order,  the  officers  of  the  civil  and  police\nadministration remained present with armed force and lathi  force  at  the\nhospital.  After the  post  mortem,  the  dead  bodies  were  taken  in  a\nprocession to the house of Chhotan Shukla.  The procession was led by Arun\nKumar Singh,  Ramesh  Thakur,  Shashi  Shekhar  Thakur,  Ram  Babu  Singh,\nHarendra Kumar, Vijay Kumar Shukla @  Munna  Shukla  and  others  and  was\nescorted by the officers of the civil and police administration.  When the\nprocession reached the house of Chhotan  Shukla,  Anand  Mohan,  MLA,  and\nLovely Anand, M.P., and others who were present there, offered flowers  to\nthe dead body of Chhotan Shukla.  At about 3.30 p.m.,  the  dead  body  of\nChottan Shukla was taken in a procession to his ancestral house in village\nJalalpur under Lalganj Thana in Vaishali district where about 5000  people\ngathered.  Thereafter, the procession  was  led  by  Anand  Mohan,  Lovely\nAnand, Professor Arun Kumar Singh, Akhlak Ahmad, Harender Kumar, Rameshwar\nWiplavi and others and they were all in different vehicles.   Anand  Mohan\nand Lovely Anand were sitting in their Contessa car.   An  Ambassador  car\nand a white coloured Gypsy were moving in front of the  procession.   When\nthe procession reached the Bhagwanpur Chowk,  the  dead  body  of  Chottan\nShukla was kept for a while and Anand Mohan, Lovely  Anand  and  Professor\nArun Kumar Singh gave speeches instigating the crowd to  take  revenge  of\nthe murder of Chhotan Shukla  and  others  by  murder  and  to  teach  the\nadministration a lesson if it created any hurdle.  After listening to  the\nspeeches, the people became aggressive.  The procession  then  moved  from\nBhagwanpur Chowk towards Ram Dayal Nagar through the National Highway.  At\nabout 4.15 p.m. when the  procession  came  near  Khabra  Village  on  the\nNational Highway, the shouts “Maro Maro” were heard from the midst of  the\nprocession.  When the informant along  with  other  officers  reached  the\nplace from where the shouts were being heard, they found that on the right\nhand side of the road the  Ambassador  car  of  the  District  Magistrate,\nGopalganj,  G. Krishnaiyyah  (coming  from  the  opposite  direction)  had\nturned turtle and the District Magistrate was lying on the  ground.   They\nalso saw Anand Mohan, Lovely Anand, Professor Arun Kumar  Singh  and  some\nothers were loudly provoking  Bhutkun Shukla (brother of  Chhotan  Shukla)\nto kill the District Magistrate and  take  revenge.   Thereafter,  Bhutkun\nShukla drew out a revolver from his waist and fired three shots  and  then\nescaped into the crowd.  The District Magistrate got wounded.  Looking  at\nthe gravity of the situation, the Sub-Divisional  Officer  (East)  ordered\nlathi charge and the police and other officers  present  started  charging\nlathi at the crowd.  The District Magistrate, Gopalganj,  was  sent  in  a\nGypsy to the SKM College Hospital for  treatment.   Information  was  sent\nthrough wireless to the District Headquarters of Vaishali  District  about\nthe incident.  In the meantime, the assailants fled  to  Hajipur  and  the\ninformant and the Sub-Divisional Officer (East) chased the assailants  and\nreached Hajipur where they found 15  persons  including  Anand  Mohan  and\nLovely Anand caught by the  Hajipur  police.   All  the  15  persons  were\narrested and their vehicles were seized.  After the informant came back to\nMuzaffarpur, he got information that the District  Magistrate,  Gopalganj,\ndied at the SKM College Hospital.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">3.    Pursuant to the FIR, investigation was carried out by the police and\na charge-sheet was filed against 36 accused persons.   The  learned  Chief\nJudicial Magistrate, Muzaffarpur,  committed  the  case  to  the  Sessions\nCourt.  The Sessions Court framed charge under Section  147  and  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections\n302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_3\">149</a> of the Indian Penal Code (for short ‘the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_4\">IPC</a>’) against all the  36\naccused persons (A-1 to A-36) for being members of unlawful assembly  with\nthe common object of committing the murder  of  the  District  Magistrate,\nGopalganj, G.

All  the  36\naccused persons were also charged for the offence under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections  302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_8\">109</a>\nfor abetting the commission of the murder of the deceased.   Anand  Mohan,\nLovely  Anand  and  Professor  Arun  Kumar  Singh  (A-1,   A-2   and   A-3\nrespectively) were further charged under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/112749/\" id=\"a_10\">114</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.    At the trial, the prosecution examined as many as 25 witnesses.  PW-\n1 to PW-14 were police officials who claimed to  be  with  or  behind  the\nprocession till the incident occurred. PW-15, PW-16 and PW-23 were doctors\nwho proved the injury reports and the post mortem report.  PW-17 and PW-21\nare the driver and the bodyguard of the deceased.  PW-18 and PW-19 are the\nDirector and employee of  the  Forensic  Science  Laboratory,  Patna,  who\ncollected the blood-stained earth and broken  pieces  of  glass  from  the\nplace of occurrence.  PW-20 is the Executive  Magistrate  who  accompanied\nthe  procession.   PW-22  is  the  Assistant  Sub-Inspector,   Muzaffarpur\nDistrict, who investigated the case from 14.12.1994 to 16.12.1994.   PW-25\nis the Additional S.P. Muzaffarpur who investigated the  case  for  a  few\nhours and PW-24 is the second investigating  officer.   The  defence  also\nexamined twelve witnesses at the trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.    The Additional Sessions Judge-I, Patna (for short ‘the trial court’)\nfound Anand Mohan,  Lovely  Anand,  Professor  Arun  Kumar  Singh,  Akhlak\nAhamad, Vijay Kumar Shukla @ Munna Shukla, Harendra Kumar @  Harendra  Pd.\nSahi and Shashi Shekhar Thakur (A-1, A-2,  A-3,  A-4,  A-5,  A-6  and  A-7\nrespectively) guilty of the offences under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_12\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_13\">149</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_14\">307</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_15\">149</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_16\">427</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_17\">149</a> of the IPC.  The trial court also  held  Anand  Mohan,  Lovely\nAnand, Professor Arun Kumar Singh and Akhlak Ahamad (A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4\nrespectively) guilty of the offence of abetment  to  commit  murder  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_18\">Sections 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_19\">109</a> IPC.  The trial court  acquitted  the  remaining  accused\npersons A-8 to A-36 of all the charges.  After hearing on the question  of\nsentence, the trial court sentenced A-1, A-3 and  A-4  to  death  for  the\noffence under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_20\">Sections  302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_21\">149</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_22\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_23\">109</a>  of  the  IPC  and  further\nsentenced them for one year R.I. for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 147</a> IPC,  5\nyears R.I. for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 307</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_26\">147</a> IPC and one year R.I. for\nthe offence under <a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 427</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_28\">149</a> IPC and all the sentences  were  to  run\nconcurrently.   The  trial  court,  however,   sentenced   A-2   to   life\nimprisonment for the offences under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_29\">Sections 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_30\">149</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_31\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_32\">109</a> IPC and a\nfine of Rs.25,000/-, for one year R.I. for the offence under  <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_33\">Section  147</a>\nIPC, 5 years R.I. for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 307</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_35\">149</a> IPC and  one  year\nR.I. for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 427</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_37\">149</a> IPC and all the sentences  were\nto run concurrently and in default of payment of fine she was  to  undergo\nsimple imprisonment for a period of two years.  The trial court  sentenced\nA-5, A-6 and A-7 for life  imprisonment  for  the  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_38\">Section\n302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_39\">149</a> IPC and to pay fine of Rs.25,000/- each, R.I. for five  years  for\nthe offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 307</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_41\">149</a> IPC, R.I. for one year for  the  offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 147</a> IPC and R.I. for one year for the offence under  <a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_43\">Section\n427</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_44\">149</a>  IPC  and  in  default  of  payment  of  fine  to  undergo  simple\nimprisonment for two years and all the sentences were to run concurrently.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">6.    The sentence of death on A-1, A-3 and A-4 were referred to the  High\nCourt.  Criminal appeals were also filed by the convicts before  the  High\nCourt.  The High Court held in  the  impugned  common  judgment  that  the\nprosecution has not been able to establish a  case  of  unlawful  assembly\nwith common object of causing death of the deceased, or any  other  person\nand thus there could be no conviction under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_45\">Sections 147</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_46\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_47\">149</a>  IPC.\nThe High Court, however, held on the basis of evidence of PW-1, PW-3,  PW-\n4, PW-9, PW-10 and PW-14 that A-1 had exhorted the lone  shooter  to  kill\nthe deceased and hence he alone was guilty of the offence of  abetment  of\nmurder under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_49\">109</a> IPC.  Accordingly, the High Court acquitted A-\n2 to A-7 of all the charges  and  sustained  the  conviction  of  A-1  but\nconverted the sentence of death on A-1 to one of rigorous imprisonment for\nlife.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">7.    Aggrieved, A-1  has  filed  Criminal  Appeal  No.1804-1805  of  2009\nchallenging the impugned judgment of the  High  Court  in  so  far  as  it\nsustained his  conviction  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_50\">Section  302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_51\">109</a>  IPC  and  imposed  the\npunishment of rigorous imprisonment for life.   The  State  of  Bihar  has\nfiled Criminal Appeal Nos. 1536, 1537, 1538, 1539, 1540,  1541,  1542  and\n1806 of 2009 challenging the impugned judgment of the High  Court  insofar\nas it acquitted A-2 to A-7 and insofar as it converted the death  sentence\non A-1 to life imprisonment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">CONTENTIONS\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">8.    Mr.  Ram  Jethmalani,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  A-1\nsubmitted that the occurrence took place at 4.15 P.M.  on  05.12.1994  and\nsoon thereafter information was sent  through  wireless  to  the  District\nHeadquarter,  Vaishali  District  about  the  incident  and   hence   this\ninformation was the real FIR and would disclose the first account  of  the\noccurrence.  He vehemently argued that this  wireless  message  sent  soon\nafter the incident to  the  District  Headquarters  of  District  Vaishali\nclearly stated that the people who got mixed with the  funeral  procession\nof the cremation of Chhotan Shukla have injured the deceased  by  shooting\nhim with a revolver and fled towards Hajipur  by  different  vehicles  and\nthis was the real FIR of the case but the High Court has not even  applied\nits mind to this real FIR of the case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">9.    He submitted that instead of this wireless message, a  typed  report\nof the informant PW-14 has been treated as the FIR.  He argued  that  this\ntyped report of PW-14 treated as FIR is stated to have been lodged in  the\nSadar P.S. at 22:10 hrs. (10.10 P.M.) on 05.12.1994, but the  evidence  of\nPW-11 would show that the informant PW-14  returned  to  Muzaffarpur  only\nafter 2.00 A.M. on 06.12.1994. He submitted that the High Court  has  also\nnoticed in the impugned judgment  that  the  FIR  mentioned  the  name  of\nDy.S.P.-Dhiraj Kumar as the Investigating Officer who joined  after  leave\non duty on 06.12.2004 and took up investigation  at  8.15  A.M.  from  the\nfirst I.O. PW-25  He argued that all these facts  clearly  establish  that\nnot only the FIR was ante-dated and ante-timed as 05.12.1994,  10.10  P.M.\nbut also fabricated by PW-14 making  false  allegations  against  A-1  and\nagainst the  members  of  his  political  party  on  the  instructions  of\npolitical superiors.  He contended that the High Court  having  held  that\nthere was evidence to suspect that the FIR was ante-dated  and  ante-timed\nshould have also come to the conclusion that the entire  prosecution  case\nas stated in the FIR by PW-14 was false.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">10.   Mr. Jethmalani next  submitted  that  the  High  Court  has  rightly\nrejected the prosecution version that there was an unlawful assembly  with\nthe object of murdering the deceased and, therefore,  the  offences  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 147</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_53\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_54\">149</a> were not made  out  against  any  of  the  accused\npersons.  He contended that having come to this finding,  the  High  Court\ncould not have held A-1 guilty of the offence of abetting the murder under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_56\">109</a> IPC on the ground that A-1 had incited Bhutkun  Shukla  to\ncommit the murder.  He submitted that almost all the prosecution witnesses\nhave stated that the deceased was shot by Bhutkun Shukla when he was lying\ninjured on the ground, but the medical evidence establishes  that  he  was\nshot when he was in a standing position and thus the prosecution witnesses\nhave not actually seen the incident nor heard any exhortation  by  A-1  to\nBhutkun to kill the deceased.   He  argued  that  the  High  Court  having\nrecorded the finding that  PW-11  was  a  false  witness  could  not  have\nbelieved the other witnesses supporting the case that was put  forward  by\nPW-11 in his evidence.  He relied on the station Diary entry Nos. 92,  94,\n97 and 102 of the Police Station of PW-11 to show that PW-11 was not  even\nthere in the procession accompanying the dead body of Chhotan  Shukla  but\nhad gone for some investigation at the University where he  was  stationed\nas a police officer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">11.   He argued that the High Court failed to realize that A-1  along with\nhis wife A-2 were in a white Contessa Car which was almost at the front of\nthe procession behind the police car and the Tata Maxi carrying  the  dead\nbodies of Chhotan Shukla and another, whereas the shouts of   “maro  maro”\ncame from the rear of the procession and the witnesses  have  all  deposed\nthat when they reached there they found that the Car was  over-turned  and\nthe deceased was lying injured on  the  ground.   He  submitted  that  the\ndeceased was, therefore, dead before A-1 Anand Mohan could come  from  his\nContessa car to the place of occurrence and the entire  prosecution  story\nthat Bhutkun was incited by A-1 to kill the deceased must  necessarily  be\nfalse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">12.   Mr. Jethmalani submitted that the High Court  failed  to  appreciate\nthe following circumstances:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       (i)  There is no evidence that A-1 knew the deceased and, therefore,\n       when the car of the deceased came from the  opposite  direction  and\n       crossed the Contessa Car in which A-1 was sitting he  did  not  know\n       that it was the deceased who was sitting in the car and there was no\n       reason for him to incite any one to kill him;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       (ii)  There is no evidence that A-1 got  out  of  his  Contessa  Car\n       which was in front of the procession and went towards  the  rear  of\n       the procession to incite the killing of the deceased;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       (iii)        The provocative speech  attributed  to    A-1  were  at\n       Bhagwanpur Chowk and the police officers are the only witnesses  who\n       have deposed with regard to such provocative speech by A-1 and their\n       deposition that the speech was provocative was the  opinion  of  the\n       police officers and hence the High Court rightly did not rely on the\n       provocative speech of A-1 to convict him;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       (iv)   There were discrepancies in the evidence  of  witnesses  with\n       regard to the exhortation by the accused persons to Bhutkun to shoot\n       and thus the High Court  should  have  rejected  the  story  of  the\n       prosecution that A-1 incited Bhutkun to shoot the deceased;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       (v)   The prosecution story  that  the  procession  wanted  to  seek\n       vengeance on the  administration  is  falsified  by  an  independent\n       witness PW-12 (Tara Razak), the SDO who accompanied the procession;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       (vi)   The High Court did not take into consideration  the  evidence\n       of PW-17 and 21, the driver and the body guard of the deceased,  who\n       did not support the prosecution case.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">He submitted that had the High Court considered  these  circumstances,  it\nwould have acquitted A-1 of all the charges.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">13.     Mr. Ranjeet Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing for the  State\nof Bihar, submitted that the court must appreciate the  facts  which  have\nled to the occurrence in this case.  He submitted that Chhotan Shukla  was\na candidate in the ensuing State Assembly elections on behalf of the Bihar\nPeoples Party of which A-1 and A-2 were leaders and on 04.12.1994  Chhotan\nShukla and his four associates were killed  by  some  unknown  persons  in\nMuzaffarpur.  He submitted that the gathering on  05.12.1994  at  the  SKM\nCollege Hospital where the bodies of Chhotan Shukla and others were  taken\nfor post mortem was of people belonging to the Bihar Peoples Party and the\nprocession which accompanied the dead bodies of Chhotan Shukla and  others\nwas a show of  political  strength  displayed  by  A-1  and  A-2  and  his\npolitical  associates.   He  submitted  that  the   provocative   speeches\ndelivered by A-1, A-2 and  others  of  the  Bihar  Peoples  Party  at  the\nBhagwanpur Chowk aroused the emotions in the crowd of almost  5000  people\nto take revenge by bloodshed and this was the cause for  the  violence  on\nthe car of the deceased which was coming from the opposite direction  when\nthe procession reached Village Khabra.   He  submitted  that  the  violent\ncrowd pulled out the occupants of the car, beat them, overturned  the  car\nand finally Bhutkun Shukla shot the deceased on the exhortation of A-1  to\nA-4  because  the  deceased  represented  the  State  administration.   He\nsubmitted that the High Court has not appreciated these  background  facts\nwhich led to the murder of the deceased and has acquitted A-2 to  A-7  and\nhas sustained only the conviction of A-1 under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_58\">109</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1460988\" id=\"span_1\">14.   In reply to the submissions of  Mr.  Jethmalani  that  the  wireless\nmessage sent to the District Headquarters, Vaishali  district  soon  after\nthe incident on 5.12.1994 was the real FIR, Mr.  Ranjeet  Kumar  submitted\nthat the wireless message was very cryptic and could not be treated as  an\nFIR.  He cited the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1460988/\" id=\"a_59\">Binay Kumar Singh and  others\nv. State of Bihar</a> [(1997) 1 SCC 283] in which it has been  held  that  the\nofficer in-charge of the police station is not obliged to  accept  as  FIR\nany nebulous information received from somebody which  does  not  disclose\nany authentic cognizable offence and it is open to the  officer  in-charge\nto collect more information  containing  details  of  the  occurrence,  if\navailable, so that he can consider whether a cognizable offence  has  been\ncommitted warranting investigation.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"122045\" id=\"span_2\">15.   On the delay in lodging the FIR, he referred to the evidence of  the\ninformant, PW-14, to show that he had to first send the  deceased  in  the\nGypsy car for treatment to the SKM College Hospital and he had  to  go  to\nHajipur to arrest the accused persons and only after the  accused  persons\nwere taken to custody at Hajipur, he came back to Muzaffarpur and prepared\nthe typed report and lodged the same as FIR in the  Sadar  P.S.  at  about\n10.00 P.M. in the night.  He submitted  that  there  was  thus  sufficient\nexplanation for the delay in lodging the  FIR.   He  cited  <a href=\"/doc/122045/\" id=\"a_60\">Erram  Santosh\nReddy and others v. State of Andhra Pradesh</a> [(1991) 3 SCC  206]  in  which\nthere was a delay of six hours in lodging  the  FIR  and  the  prosecution\nexplained that the police had to raid, effect  recoveries  and  thereafter\nsubmit a report in the concerned police station and on  these  facts  this\nCourt held that no adverse inference could be drawn because of  the  delay\nin lodging the FIR.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1820883\" id=\"span_3\">He submitted that in <a href=\"/doc/1820883/\" id=\"a_61\">Amar Singh v. Balwinder Singh  &amp;\nOrs.</a> [(2003) 2 SCC 518] this Court has held that a delay of  26  hours  in\nlodging the FIR from the time of the incident was fully explained from the\nevidence on record and, therefore, no adverse  inference  could  be  drawn\nagainst the prosecution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"126399\" id=\"span_4\">16.   Mr. Ranjeet Kumar  submitted  that  the  medical  evidence  did  not\naltogether make the ocular evidence improbable.  He argued that the ocular\nevidence of different witnesses categorically states that  Bhutkun  Shukla\ncame out from the crowd and fired 3 shots and  PW-16,  who  conducted  the\npost mortem, has stated that there were three bullet injuries in the  body\nof the deceased.  He submitted that no one can predict how  a  human  body\nwould respond to the first bullet shot and therefore from  the  nature  of\nthe bullet injuries in the body of the deceased who was shot from  a  very\nclose range, one cannot conclude that the deceased  could  not  have  been\nshot after he fell on the ground as contended by Mr. Jethmalani.  He cited\nthe decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/126399/\" id=\"a_62\">Abdul Sayeed  v.  State  of  Madhya  Pradesh</a>\n[(2010) 10 SCC 259] for the proposition that ocular testimony has  greater\nevidentiary value vis-à-vis medical evidence.  He submitted  that  in  the\npresent case the medical evidence does not go so far as to  rule  out  the\ntruth of the ocular evidence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1048134\" id=\"span_5\">17.   He submitted that the oral evidence in this case is consistent  that\nA-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4 not only delivered provocative speeches against  the\nadministration and  aroused  the  emotions  of  the  crowd  to  resort  to\nbloodshed but also exhorted Bhutkun Shukla to shoot at  the  deceased  who\nrepresented the State administration.  He referred to the evidence of  PWs\n1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 who  have  deposed  about\nthe provocative speeches and exhortation of A-1 to A-4.  He cited  <a href=\"/doc/1048134/\" id=\"a_63\">Masalti\nv. State of U.P.</a> [1964(8) SCR 133] wherein this Court has held that  where\na criminal  court  has  to  deal  with  the  evidence  pertaining  to  the\ncommission of offence involving large number of offenders and large number\nof victims, it is usual to adopt a  test  that  the  conviction  could  be\nsustained only if it is supported by two or three or  more  witnesses  who\ngive a consistent account of  the  incident.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1048134\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"178289762\" id=\"span_7\">He  also  referred  to  the\ndecisions of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/178289762/\" id=\"a_64\">Binay Kumar Singh and others v.

He relied on the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/29943/\" id=\"a_71\">Rizan and  Another  v.\nState  of  Chhattisgarh</a>  [(2003)  2  SCC  661]  to   argue   that   normal\ndiscrepancies in evidence are likely to occur  due  to  normal  errors  of\nobservations, normal errors of memory due to lapse  of  time  and  due  to\nmental disposition such as shock and horror at the time of occurrence  but\nthese discrepancies do not make the evidence of a witness untrue and it is\nonly the material discrepancy which affect the credibility  of  a  party’s\ncase.  He submitted that had the  High  Court  overlooked  the  minor  and\nnormal discrepancies in the evidence of different witnesses who had  given\ntheir account of the incident as observed by them from different places at\nthe spot at the time of occurrence it would have come  to  the  conclusion\nthat the witnesses gave a consistent account of the involvement of A-1  to\nA-7 in committing the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_72\">Sections 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_73\">149</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_74\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_75\">109</a> IPC.   He\nsubmitted that High  Court,  therefore,  could  not  have  set  aside  the\nfindings of the trial court and  should  have  sustained  also  the  death\nsentence on A-1, A-3 and A-4.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"870692\" id=\"span_11\">20.

He  cited  the\ndecision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/870692/\" id=\"a_76\">Bhagaloo Lodh and Another   v.  State  of  Uttar\nPradesh</a>  [(2011) 13 SCC 206] in which it has been  held  that  prompt  and\nearly reporting of the occurrence by the informant  with  all   its  vivid\ndetails gives an assurance regarding the truth of its  version  and  where\nthere is a delay in lodging the FIR without any explanation a  presumption\ncan be raised that the allegations in the  FIR  were  false  and  that  it\ncontains a coloured version of the events that had taken place.</span>   He  also\nrelied on Awadesh  v.

State of Maharashtra</a> [(1978) 4 SCC 371] in which this Court  has  held\nthat the inordinate delay in the registration of the FIR and further delay\nin recording the  statement  of  material  witnesses  caused  a  cloud  of\nsuspicion  on  the  credibility  of  the  entire  warp  and  woof  of  the\nprosecution story.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"552074\" id=\"span_13\">He submitted that in <a href=\"/doc/552074/\" id=\"a_78\">Marudanal Augusti  v.

He submitted that the  High  Court  was  right  in  coming  to  the\nconclusion that no case of unlawful assembly was established  against  A-1\nto A-7.  He argued that the speeches made at  Bhagwanpur  Chowk  were  not\nprovocative but rhetorical and in any case since an  Executive  Magistrate\nwas also present all through along with the procession the Court could not\ncome to the conclusion that the accused persons  constituted  an  unlawful\nassembly either at Bhagwanpur Chowk where the speeches were  delivered  or\nat Khabra where the incident took place.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1048134\" id=\"span_14\">22.   He referred to the evidence of PW-12 &amp; PW-13 who were sub-divisional\nofficers and to the evidence  of  PW-21  who  was  the  bodyguard  of  the\ndeceased to show that these independent witnesses have not  said  anything\nabout the exhortation by A-1 to A-7 to Bhutkun to kill the  deceased.   He\nalso submitted that the evidence of  the  prosecution  witnesses  are  not\nconsistent on the point as to who exhorted Bhutkun to  kill  the  deceased\nand, therefore, the decision of this Court in  <a href=\"/doc/1048134/\" id=\"a_79\">Masalti  v.

State of Bihar</a>  [AIR 1974 SC 45]  this  Court  has\nheld that evidence of exhortation is in the very nature of things  a  weak\npiece of evidence and there is often quite a tendency  to  implicate  some\nperson in addition to the actual assailant by attributing to  that  person\nan exhortation to the assailant to  assault  the  victim  and  unless  the\nevidence in this respect is clear, cogent and reliable, no conviction  for\nabetment can be recorded against the person alleged to have  exhorted  the\nactual assailant.

He submitted  that  if  as  has  been  deposed  by  the  prosecution\nwitnesses the deceased was lying on the ground when Bhutkun shot  at  him,\nthen the first injury on the deceased could not have at all been caused by\nshooting and, therefore, the witnesses were lying.  He cited  <a href=\"/doc/26801/\" id=\"a_82\">Awadesh   v.\nState of M.P.</a> (supra) in which this Court did not believe the  prosecution\nwitnesses because of the opinion of the doctor that  the  person  who  had\ncaused the injuries on the  deceased  was  at  a  higher  level  than  the\ndeceased and this opinion was wholly inconsistent with  the  testimony  of\nthe eye-witnesses and the  medical  expert’s  opinion  corroborated  other\ncircumstances which indicated that the  eye-witnesses  had  not  seen  the\nactual occurrence.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"746741\" id=\"span_17\">He also relied on <a href=\"/doc/746741/\" id=\"a_83\">Budh Singh  v.

He submitted that the High Court has rightly held that there was  no\nunlawful assembly with the object of murdering the deceased or  any  other\nperson.  He submitted that the accused persons could not have  shared  the\nobject of Bhutkun to kill  the  deceased  and,  therefore,  there  was  no\n“common object” which is a necessary ingredient of  an  unlawful  assembly\nand hence the offences under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 147</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_87\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_88\">149</a>  IPC  have  not  been\nmade out against the accused persons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">27.

He\nsubmitted that even PW-1 has stated that no police personnel  had  reached\nthe spot where the  shooting  took  place.   He  argued  that  PW-21,  the\nbodyguard of the deceased  who  is  the  most  material  witness  had  not\nsupported the case of the prosecution that  A-1,  A-2,  A-3  and  A-4  had\nexhorted Bhutkun to shoot at  the  deceased.   He  submitted  that  it  is\ndifficult to believe that the police personnel would  not  have  prevented\nthe killing of the deceased if the killing was  about  to  take  place  in\ntheir  presence.   He  finally  submitted  that  the   photographer,   who\naccompanied the deceased, though a material witness, has not been examined\nin Court and an adverse inference should be drawn against the  prosecution\nfor withholding the photographer from giving evidence in Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">FINDINGS\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">28.     The first question that we have to decide is whether the  wireless\nmessage sent soon after the incident on 05.12.1994  is  the  real  FIR  as\ncontended  on  behalf  of  the  defence  or  whether  the   typed   report\nsubsequently lodged by PW-14 in the Muzaffarpur Sadar  Police  Station  is\nthe FIR as contended on behalf of the  prosecution.

In the present case, PW-14, the informant has chosen  not  to  treat\nthe wireless message but the subsequent typed information as the  FIR  and\nthe police has also not treated the wireless message  but  the  subsequent\ntyped information as the FIR.  Moreover, the wireless  message  sent  soon\nafter the incident on 05.12.1994 stated only that the  people  mixed  with\nthe crowd of funeral procession for the cremation of Chottan  Shukla  have\ninjured the deceased by shooting him with revolver and have  fled  towards\nHajipur by different vehicles.  This wireless message was cryptic and  did\nnot sufficiently disclose the nature of the offence  committed  much  less\nthe identity of the persons who committed the offence.  Unless  and  until\nmore information was collected on how exactly the deceased was killed,  it\nwas not mandatory for either PW-14 to lodge the same as  FIR  or  for  the\nOfficer Incharge of a police station to treat the same as  an  FIR.   Such\ncryptic information has been held by this Court not  to  be  FIR  in  some\ncases.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"72912\" id=\"span_20\">In <a href=\"/doc/72912/\" id=\"a_91\">Sheikh Ishaque and Others v. State of Bihar</a> [(1995) 3 SCC  392]\nGulabi Paswan gave a cryptic information at  the  police  station  to  the\neffect that there was a commotion at  the  village  as  firing  and  brick\nbatting was going on and this Court held that this cryptic information did\nnot even disclose the commission  of  a  cognizable  offence  nor  did  it\ndisclose who were the assailants and such a cryptic  statement  of  Gulabi\nPaswan cannot be treated to be an FIR within the meaning  of  <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_92\">Section  154</a>\nCr.P.C.  Similarly, in Binay Kumar Singh and others  v .</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1460988\" id=\"span_21\"><a href=\"/doc/1460988/\" id=\"a_93\">State  of  Bihar</a>\n(supra) information was furnished to the police  in  Ex.10/3  by  Rabindra\nBhagat that the sons of late Ram Niranjan Sharma along with  large  number\nof persons in his village have set fire to the houses and piles of  straws\nand have also resorted  to  firing.   This  Court  held  that  Ex.10/3  is\nevidently a cryptic information and is hardly sufficient  to  discern  the\ncommission  of  any  cognizable  offence  therefrom.   In  our  considered\nopinion, therefore, the trial  court  and  the  High  Court  have  rightly\ntreated the subsequent typed written information lodged by PW-14  and  not\nthe wireless message as the FIR.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">29.   The second question that we are called upon to decide is whether the\ntyped report of PW-14 which has been treated as  the  FIR  was  lodged  at\n10.10 p.m. on 05.12.1994 as claimed by prosecution or was actually  lodged\nat the Muzaffarpur Sadar Police Station in the morning  of  16.12.1994  as\ncontended by the defence.  We have perused  the  evidence  of  PW-14,  the\ninformant.  He has stated that after the deceased was injured by a  person\nwith his revolver at about 4.15  p.m.  on  05.12.1994,  the  mob  starting\nescaping from the main road to Lalganj and some people ran towards Hajipur\nand he along with others followed the mob and  reached  Hajipur  at  6  O’\nClock and went to the Circuit House and stayed there for one hour and then\nleft for Muzaffarpur at 7 O’ Clock.  In the impugned  judgment,  the  High\nCourt did not accept this evidence of  PW-14  that  he  left  Hajipur  for\nMuzaffarpur at 7.00 P.M. as it found that most of the other witnesses  had\nadmitted that they left Hajipur at 9.00 P.M. and PW-11 had  admitted  that\nhe left Hajipur at 12.00 in the midnight so as  to  reach  Muzaffarpur  at\n2.00 A.M. in the night along with others.  Though PW-11 has stated in  his\nevidence that all the people returned from Hajipur Circuit House at  7  O’\nClock, he has also stated in his evidence that he was with the SDO till 12\nin the midnight and he went to Garoul, Hajipur, and after apprehending the\naccused he returned to Muzaffarpur.  PW-11  has  further  stated  that  he\nreturned to the Sadar Police Station at Muzaffarpur at 2 O’ Clock at night\nand the DM, SP, SDO, DSP (PW-14) and other  officers  also  returned  with\nhim.  Hence, the High Court has held that PW-14 along with other  officers\nincluding PW-11 reached Muzaffarpur  at  2.00  pm  in  the  night.   After\nreaching the Sadar Police Station at Muzaffarpur,  PW-14  has  taken  some\nmore time to lodge the lengthy typed written FIR.  PW-14 has  stated  that\nfor lodging the FIR at the Muzaffarpur Sadar Police Station he  took  help\nfrom all the officers present and in  fact  took  the  statements  of  4-5\nofficers.  He has stated that he made a typed FIR and he took half an hour\nto complete the statement and it took one hour to lodge the FIR.   On  the\nbasis of all these evidence on record, the High Court did not  accept  the\nversion of the prosecution that the FIR was lodged  with  the  Muzaffarpur\nSadar Police Station at 10.10 p.m. on 05.12.1994 and has instead held that\nthe evidence creates a reasonable suspicion about the FIR being ante dated\nand ante timed.  We do not find any error in  this  finding  of  the  High\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">30.   We now come to the main contention on behalf of the defence that the\nHigh Court should have totally discarded the  prosecution  story  once  it\nheld that the evidence creates a reasonable suspicion about the FIR  being\nante-dated and ante-timed.   In none of the cases cited by the defence, we\nfind that this Court has discarded the entire prosecution  story  only  on\nthe ground that the FIR was ante dated and ante timed.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1772812\" id=\"span_22\">In  <a href=\"/doc/1772812/\" id=\"a_94\">Ganesh  Bhavan\nPatel  v.

State  of\nM.P.</a> (supra) relied on by the defence, besides finding that the  delay  in\nlodging the FIR was suspicious, this  Court  also  found  that  the  empty\ncartridges were recovered from the place of occurrence one day  after  the\nincident and the medical evidence established that the witnesses  had  not\nactually seen the incident and considering all  these  circumstances  this\nCourt held that the prosecution had not proved the case beyond  reasonable\ndoubt.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"942198\" id=\"span_25\">This Court has, on the other  hand,  held  in  <a href=\"/doc/942198/\" id=\"a_98\">State  of  M.P.  v.\nMansingh and others</a> [(2003) 10 SCC 414] that if the date and time  of  the\nFIR is suspicious, the prosecution version is not rendered vulnerable  but\nthe court is required to make  a  careful  analysis  of  the  evidence  in\nsupport of the prosecution case.  Thus, we will have  to  make  a  careful\nanalysis of the evidence in this case to find out how far the  prosecution\ncase as alleged in the FIR is true.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">31.     In the present case, the fact remains that soon after the incident\nat about 4.15 P.M. on 05.12.1994 information was sent from  the  place  of\nthe incident to the District Headquarters of Vaishali  district  that  the\npeople mixed with the funeral procession  for  the  cremation  of  Chottan\nShukla have injured the deceased by a revolver and fled towards Hajipur by\ndifferent vehicles.  At least this part  of  the  prosecution  case  which\nfinds place in the subsequent typed FIR lodged by PW-14 in the early hours\nof 06.12.1994 cannot be discarded to be false and the court will  have  to\ndecide on the basis of evidence as  to  who  amongst  the  people  in  the\nfuneral procession for cremation of Chottan Shukla are responsible for the\ninjury caused to the deceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">32.     In fact, the High Court also has not accepted the  entire  version\nof the FIR lodged by PW-14 and has rejected the case of the prosecution in\nthe FIR that there was an unlawful assembly and that A-1 to A-7 were  part\nof that unlawful assembly with the object of killing  the  deceased.   The\nHigh Court has held in the impugned judgment that the mob which surrounded\nthe car of the deceased caused damage to the car by throwing brickbats and\ncaused injuries to its occupants after pulling them  out  and  had  turned\ninto an unlawful  assembly  but  from  the  evidence  on  record  and  the\ncircumstances it is not established that even  the  members  of  such  mob\nshared the common object of killing the  deceased.   The  High  Court  has\nfurther held that some of the processionists  who  were  in  the  vehicles\nclose to the place of occurrence could have come out from  their  vehicles\nto find out the reasons for the commotion but when nobody was  even  aware\nthat the deceased would be passing through the place such  persons  cannot\nbe held to be members of unlawful assembly actuated by the  common  object\nof killing the deceased.  The High Court has also held that there were  no\nallegations that the processionists were carrying any arms and  there  was\ninsufficient evidence about the exact behaviour of  the  assembly  at  the\nscene of the occurrence.  The High Court has further held that the  driver\nand the bodyguard of the deceased have stated in their evidence  that  the\ncar could not pass on the left side of the road because of presence  of  a\nmob on the flank of the road while the funeral procession was  moving  and\nthis shows that the attack on the car of the deceased  and  its  occupants\nwas a sudden act of the mob  which  had  gathered  to  watch  the  funeral\nprocession near Khabra Village.  The High Court has found that the  driver\nand the bodyguard of the deceased have not said anything in their evidence\non what led to the anger of the mob and instead they had been  anxious  to\nshow that they had committed no mistake due  to  which  the  deceased  was\nkilled.  The High Court has thus held that the  processionists,  who  were\ngoing with the dead body on motor vehicle, did not have any common  object\nand therefore did not constitute an unlawful assembly and hence A-1 to A-7\ncould not be held liable for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_100\">149</a> IPC on  the\nground that they were members of an unlawful assembly which had the object\nof killing the deceased or any other person.  In our  considered  opinion,\nthe High Court rightly rejected the contention of the prosecution that A-1\nto A-7 were liable for conviction under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_102\">149</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">33.   The High Court after carefully  scrutinizing  the  evidence  of  the\nwitnesses has also discarded the prosecution story in the FIR lodged by PW-\n14 that A-2, A-3 and A-4 had exhorted Bhutkun Shukla to kill the deceased.\n The High Court has held that none of  the  eye-witnesses  of  Category-II\ncomprising the civil officials, the driver and the bodyguard, namely,  PW-\n12, PW-13, PW-17 and PW-21 have supported the allegations  of  exhortation\nby A-1 to A-7 and  out  of  the  Category-I  witnesses  comprising  Police\nPersonnel, PW-5 and PW-9 have not heard anyone exhorting Bhutkun Shukla to\nkill the deceased.  The High Court  has  further  held  that  out  of  the\nseventeen alleged eye-witnesses, six witnesses do not speak of exhortation\nand out of the  remaining  eleven  prosecution  witnesses,  six  witnesses\nnamely, PW-1, PW-3, PW-4, PW-9, PW-10 and PW-14, have said that  only  A-1\nexhorted Bhutkun Shukla to shoot at the deceased.  Accordingly,  the  High\nCourt has recorded the finding that only A-1 exhorted the lone shooter  to\nkill the deceased and was guilty of the offence of abetment under  <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_103\">Section\n109</a> IPC and was liable for punishment under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_105\">109</a>  IPC  for  the\nmurder of the deceased and A-2, A-3 and A-4 have to be  acquitted  of  the\ncharges under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_107\">109</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1421669\" id=\"span_26\">34.   We have gone through the evidence of the witnesses and we find  that\nthis finding of the High Court that A-2, A-3 and A-4 cannot be held guilty\nof  the  offences  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_108\">Section  302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_109\">109</a>  IPC  is  based  on  a  correct\nappreciation of evidence of the prosecution witnesses.   Out  of  fourteen\nwitnesses who accompanied the procession, only four witnesses, namely, PW-\n6, PW-7, PW-8 and PW-11 have said that A-2 along with A-1 exhorted Bhutkun\nShukla to shoot at the deceased, whereas the remaining eight  do  not  say\nthat  A-2  also  exhorted  Bhutkun  Shukla  to  shoot  at  the   deceased.\nSimilarly, out of the fourteen witnesses who accompanied  the  procession,\nonly PW-7 and PW-8 have spoken of exhortation by A-3 to Bhutkun Shukla  to\nshoot at the deceased and the remaining eleven  witnesses  have  not  said\nthat A-3 also exhorted Bhutkun Shukla to shoot at the deceased.  Again out\nof the fourteen witnesses examined by the prosecution, only PW-7 and PW-11\nhave said that A-4 also exhorted Bhutkun Shukla to shoot at the  deceased,\nbut the remaining twelve witnesses have not said that  A-4  also  exhorted\nBhutkun Shukla to shoot at the District Magistrate.  This Court  has  held\nin <a href=\"/doc/1421669/\" id=\"a_110\">Jainul Haque v. State of Bihar</a> (supra) that evidence of exhortation  is\nin the very nature of things a weak piece of evidence and there  is  often\nquite a tendency to implicate  some  person  in  addition  to  the  actual\nassailant by attributing to that person an exhortation to the assailant to\nassault the victim and unless the  evidence  in  this  respect  is  clear,\ncogent and reliable, no conviction for abetment can  be  recorded  against\nthe person alleged to have  exhorted  the  actual  assailant.   Since  the\nmajority  out  of  the  fourteen  prosecution  witnesses  comprising  both\ncivilian and police personnel accompanying the procession do  not  support\nthe prosecution version that A-2, A-3 and A-4 also exhorted Bhutkun Shukla\nto shoot at the deceased, it will not be safe to convict A-2, A-3 and  A-4\nfor the offence of abetment of the murder of the deceased.  In  our  view,\ntherefore, the High Court was right in acquitting A-2, A-3 and A-4 of  the\ncharge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_112\">109</a> IPC.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">35.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1048134\" id=\"span_27\">In <a href=\"/doc/1048134/\" id=\"a_113\">Masalti vs. State of U.P.</a> (supra), this Court has held that where\na criminal  court  has  to  deal  with  the  evidence  pertaining  to  the\ncommission of offence involving large number of offenders and large number\nof victims, it is usual to adopt a  test  that  the  conviction  could  be\nsustained only if it is supported by two or three or  more  witnesses  who\ngive a consistent account of the incident.  In this case, ten out  of  the\nfourteen witnesses who were accompanying the procession and were near  the\nplace of occurrence have given a  consistent  version  that  A-1  exhorted\nBhutkun Shukla to shoot at the deceased.  PW-1, PW-3, PW-4, PW-6, PW-7, PW-\n8, PW-9, PW-10, PW-11  and  PW-14,  have  consistently  deposed  that  A-1\nexhorted Bhutkun Shukla to shoot at  the  deceased.   The  remaining  four\nwitnesses may be at the place of occurrence but for  some  reason  or  the\nother may not have heard the exhortation by A-1 to Bhutkan to shoot at the\ndeceased.  Hence, just because four of the  fourteen  witnesses  have  not\ndeposed regarding the fact of exhortation by A-1, we cannot hold that  the\nten witnesses have falsely deposed that A-1 had exhorted Bhutkun to  shoot\nat the deceased.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">36.    We have also considered the submission of the  defence  that  these\nwitnesses have deposed that the deceased was shot by Bhutkun  Shukla  when\nhe was lying injured on the ground but the  medical  evidence  establishes\nthat the bullets were fired when the deceased was in the standing position\nand on this ground the evidence of these ten witnesses  who  have  deposed\nwith regard to exhortation by A-1  to  Bhutkun  Shukla  to  shoot  at  the\ndeceased should be discarded.  We find that PW-16, Dr.  Momtaj  Ahmad  who\ncarried out the post mortem on the dead body of the deceased on 05.12.1994\nat 4.40 P.M. has described in his evidence the following three ante mortem\ninjuries on the body of the deceased:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        “(1)(a) Due oval wound 1/3” in diameter with  inverted  margin  and\n        burning of the area on lateral side of the left eye brow.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        (b) lacerated injury internal cavity deep with inverted margin  was\n        found on central part of forehead just above eye  brow  3”  x  1.2”\n        into internal cavity from which fractured piece of frontal bone and\n        brain material was prodding out.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">        On dissection the two wound were found interconnected.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">        (ii) One oval wound ¼” in diameter with inverted margin  was  found\n        at left cheek.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">        On dissection maxilla and mandible were found fractured and  tongue\n        and inner part of lower lip was found  lacerated.   The  projectile\n        after entering the left cheek and damaging above organs have passed\n        away from oval cavity.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">        (iii) One oval wound  with  interverted  margin  and  singling  and\n        burning of the margin ¼” in diameter was found  on  right  parietal\n        region of head;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">        (b) One oval wound 1.3”  x  ½’’  into  internal  cavity  deep  with\n        everted margin was found on left parietal region of head.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_47\">        On dissection two wounds were found interconnected with facture  of\n        skull bone into so many pieces and laceration of brain tissue.”\n\n\n\nPW-16 has further stated in his evidence that out of  these  3  wounds,  2\nwere on the left side and one on the right side of the body.  In his cross\nexamination, PW-16 has stated:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        “34. The projectile may travel in the  body  even  in  standing  or\n        sleeping position.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">        38. Injury No.II indicates that the patient may be able to move his\n        face.  From my postmortem report it appears that only after causing\n        injury No.II the other injury No.III was caused.  After  sustaining\n        injury No.III the one could not be moved and as  such  injury  No.1\n        might not have been inflicted.  On parity of logic  vice  versa  is\n        also correct.  Thus injury No.(i) was caused  before  injury  No.II\n        (Volunteers that instead of definite was or were, if they should be\n        read may and might)”\n\n\n\nThe evidence of PW-16 is clear that the projectile may travel in the  body\neven in standing or sleeping position.  PW-16 has stated that injury  No.I\nmay have been caused and thereafter injury No.II  may  have  been  caused.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">Moreover, injury No.II indicates that the deceased may have been  able  to\nmove his face.  He has also stated that  from  the  postmortem  report  it\nappears that only after causing injury No.II the other injury  No.III  may\nhave been caused.  Thus, the argument of Mr. Ranjeet Kumar that after  the\ninjury No.II on his left cheek, the deceased may have turned his face  and\nthereafter injury No.III on the left parietal region of his head may  have\nbeen caused cannot be rejected.   We  cannot,  therefore,  hold  that  the\nmedical evidence is such as to entirely rule out the truth of the evidence\nof the prosecution witnesses that the deceased was shot when he was  lying\ninjured on the ground.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">37.    We may now deal with the contention of the defence  that  the  High\nCourt did not take into consideration the evidence of PW-17 and PW-21, who\nwere the driver and the bodyguard of the deceased  respectively,  and  who\ndid not support the prosecution case.  We have gone through  the  evidence\nof PW-17 (driver) who has stated that  the  people  participating  in  the\nprocession surrounded the car of the  deceased  and  were  shouting  ‘maro\nmaro’ and that they pulled out the deceased and the  bodyguard   and  then\nbegan to assault them, but he escaped and hid behind the vehicle and after\na gap of five to six minutes when he returned he found the procession  was\nnot there but the police was present there with their vehicles and he  saw\nthe deceased lying on the road in injured condition and  the  car  of  the\ndeceased was lying inverted and thereafter the deceased was carried to the\nHospital in the police vehicle and he also went in the same vehicle to the\nHospital and later on he came to know that the deceased was dead.  We have\nalso gone through the evidence of PW-21 (bodyguard) who has  deposed  that\nthe crowd was shouting ‘maro maro’ and they beat him, the driver  as  well\nas the deceased and turned the vehicle and  they  sustained  injuries  and\nafter some time the police came over there and the  stampede  started  and\npolice sent the deceased and him to the Hospital and he came to know  that\nthe deceased was dead.  Both PW-17 and PW-21, therefore, are  silent  with\nregard to exhortation by A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-4 to Bhutkun to shoot at  the\ndeceased.  It appears that PW-17 and PW-21 were not aware of any  shooting\nincident at all and they were under the impression that the  deceased  had\nbeen injured by the assault of the mob after he was pulled  out  from  the\ncar.  PW-17 and PW-21, in our considered opinion, do not seem to know what\nexactly happened after they were pulled out from the car and beaten up  by\nthe mob.  On the basis of their evidence, the  Court  cannot  discard  the\nevidence of ten other witnesses that the deceased was shot by Bhutkun with\nthe  revolver  on  the  exhortation  of  A-1  when  the  medical  evidence\nestablished that the cause of death of the deceased was on account of  the\nbullet injuries on the deceased and not the assault by the mob.  Moreover,\nPW-17 and PW-21 may not have supported  the  prosecution  case  but  their\nevidence also does not belie the prosecution case that  the  deceased  was\nshot by Bhutkun on the exhortation by A-1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">38.   We now come to the submission of Mr.  Jethmalani  that  as  A-1  was\nsitting in a Contessa car which was in the front of the procession and  as\nthe killing of the deceased took place in the middle  of  the  procession,\nthe evidence of the eye-witnesses should be  discarded  as  not  probable.\nThe prosecution has been able to adduce  evidence  through  its  witnesses\nthat at the time of shooting of the deceased, A-1 was at the spot and  was\nexhorting Bhutkun Shukla to shoot at the  deceased.   If  A-1  wanted  the\nCourt to believe that at the time of the incident he was in  the  Contessa\ncar in the front of the procession and not at the  spot,  he  should  have\ntaken this defence in his statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_114\">Section  313</a>  Cr.P.C.  and  also\nproduced reliable evidence in support of this defence.  <a href=\"/doc/192696/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 103</a> of the\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872 provides that the burden  of  proof  as  to  any\nparticular fact lies on that person who wishes the Court to believe in its\nexistence, unless it is provided by any law that the proof  of  that  fact\nshall lie on any particular person.  The prosecution by  leading  evidence\nthrough its several witnesses has established that A-1 was at the place of\noccurrence and had exhorted Bhutkun Shukla to shoot at the deceased.  If A-\n1 wanted the Court to reject this prosecution  version  as  not  probable,\nburden was on him to lead evidence that he was not at the spot and did not\nexhort Bhutkun Shukla  to  shoot  at  the  deceased.   Since  he  has  not\ndischarged this burden, the High Court was right in holding that  A-1  was\nguilty of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_117\">109</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">39.   Regarding the sentence, the High Court  has  held  that  though  the\ndeceased was a District Magistrate, he was killed in another  district  as\nan occupant of a car by chance on account of mob fury and exhortation by A-\n1 and firing by Bhutkun Shukla and as A-1 was not the  assailant  himself,\ndeath sentence would not be the appropriate sentence.  We agree with  this\nview of the High Court and we are of the view that this  was  not  one  of\nthose rarest of rare cases where the High Court should have confirmed  the\ndeath sentence on A-1.  In our considered  opinion,  A-1  was  liable  for\nrigorous imprisonment for life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">40.   In the result, we do not find any merit in either the appeal of  A-1\nor the appeals of the State and we accordingly dismiss  all  the  criminal\nappeals.</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n                                                               .……………………….J.\n                                                             (A.
