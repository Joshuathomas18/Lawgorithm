Shri Rawal learned counsel appearing for the appellants has\nargued that there are material contradictions between the deposition of\ntwo material prosecution witnesses viz Shivkanya w/o Shobaram\n(deceased No.2) and Nandu s/o Shankarlal (nephew of Shobharam).\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">Shivkanya w/o Shobaram (deceased No.2) (P/W-6) in her deposition at\nPara 2 has stated that deceased Shobaram (deceased No.2) was taken\naway a day after deceased Shantilal (deceased No.3) was taken but did\nnot say that she saw Mukesh taking either of the deceased whereas\nNandu s/o Shankarlal (nephew of Shobharam) (P/W-7) in his\ndeposition stated that deceased Shobaram (deceased No.2) was taken\naway two days after deceased Shantilal (deceased No.3) was taken but\nhe saw lastly only deceased Shobaram (deceased No.2) with Mukesh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">(17). It is further submitted by the learned counsel that undisputedly\nno missing report for deceased Bharat (deceased No.1) was ever\nlodged even though he was missing for 4 months nor was any missing\nreport lodged for deceased Shantilal (deceased No.3). No attempts\nwere made even to inquire as to how and from where Mukesh came to\nbe in possession of the audio cassette. Even after deceased Shobaram\n(deceased No.2) went missing, the missing complaint was lodged after\na delay of 3 days but no explanation has been given for it. The conduct\nof the family members was unnatural as Mukesh was roaming freely in\nthe village as deposed by both Shivkanya w/o Shobaram (deceased\nNo.2) and Nandu s/o Shankarlal (nephew of Shobharam). Shivkanya\nw/o Shobaram (deceased No.2) in their cross-examination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">(18). It is further argued by Shri Rawal learned counsel that the\ncassette with the alleged audio recording of deceased Bharat (deceased\nNo.1) was shown to be seized (Seizure memo- Exhibit P/66) from\nShivkanya but was never produced or played before the Trial Court.\nMoreover, Shivkanya did not depose about the existence of such\ncassette in her deposition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">(19). It is further submitted by the learned counsel that Mukesh was\narrested on 24.03.2005 at 1:00 AM and his memorandum under<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_55\"> S. 27</a>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">                                - : 15 :-\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\"><a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_56\">Indian Evidence Act</a> was prepared on 24.03.2005 at 6:40 AM.

It is further submitted by the learned counsel that no recovery\nPanchnama of the dead bodies (Baramadagi Panchnama) was\nprepared. Nothing to show on the record as to based on whose\ninformation the dead bodies were recovered or not. Moreover, except\nfor Kantilal @ Kanha s/o Girdharilal who turned hostile, none of the\nlandowners, on whose agricultural lands the dead bodies were\nallegedly said to be recovered, were examined. It is pertinent to\nmention here that these were private irrigated lands (as per Khasra\nExhibit- P/49 in CRA No. 363/2007; Exhibit- P/38 in CRA No.\n364/2007; Exhibit- P/48 in CRA No. 362/2007) allegedly close to each\nother and it was highly abnormal that the landowners failed to notice\nany anomaly on an irrigated land.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">(21).

Shri Rawal learned counsel has argued that the dead bodies\nwere identified by Nandu s/o Shankarlal (nephew of Shobharam)\n(P/W-7) based on the clothes of the deceased. The prosecution has\nutterly failed to gather cogent scientific shreds of evidence as to the\nidentity of the dead bodies especially to the skeletal body recovered. It\nis pertinent to mention here that the skeletal body was allegedly\nidentified as Bharat (deceased No.1) only on the basis of the clothes on\nit as it had maximally decomposed. However, not even a single\nprosecution witness mentioned what clothes deceased Bharat\n(deceased No.1) was wearing when he went missing. As stated above\nthere is no missing complaint/report as to Bharat lal (deceased No.1).\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">No DNA report, FSL report was produced to corroborate the alleged\nidentification. Dr KS Dodwa (P/W- 6) in Para 3 of his cross-\nexamination stated that in that stage of decomposition it was not\npossible to identify the dead body. In para 4, he deposes that cause of\ndeath in the case of skeletal body alleged to be of Bharat (deceased\nNo.1) could not be ascertained. The same findings find mention in the\nPM report too (Exhibit- P/5). Resultantly, it could not be proved\nwhether the death was accidental, homicidal or suicidal or natural.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">(23). Shri Rawal      learned counsel       has emphasized that the\nInvestigating officer JK Sharma (P/W- 32) made arrests of other co-\naccused based on absolutely no evidence/enquiry whatsoever way\nbefore the memorandum of Mukesh taken under<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_58\"> S. 27</a> Indian Evidence\nAct, which was the first disclosure memo recorded in writing. There is\nunequivocally nothing in the entire record to show how he came to\nknow about the involvement of the other co-accused in the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">                                - : 17 :-\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">commission of the alleged crime. Meaning thereby, that without any\nevidence/inquiry, number of accused were arrested in order to show\nthe gravity of the offence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">(24). It is further submitted by the learned counsel that the red color\nmotorcycle and the front wheel of the same motorcycle were recovered\non the basis of the Memorandum of Bindu @ Pushkar under<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_59\"> S. 27</a>\nIndian Evidence Act and Memorandum of Ghanshyam under<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_60\"> S. 27</a>\nIndian Evidence Act (Exhibit- P/13), respectively, belonged to the\ndeceased Shantilal. They both have been made accused on the basis of\nsaid recoveries. However, nothing was brought on record to prove the\nregistration certificate of the said vehicle or even its Chassis/Engine\nNumber to ascertain the actual registered owner, more so no separate\ncharge under<a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_61\"> S. 201</a> IPC for concealment of the said motorcycle was\nframed as against the appellants/accused and therefore, they could not\nhave been convicted on the said premise.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">(25). Finally learned has concluded that in these three crimes motive\nhas not been proved at all. All these cases are based on circumstantial\nevidence as no eyewitness came forward to claim that he/she\nwitnessed the incident. The case categorically does not fall in the\ncategory of rarest of rare cases wherein capital punishment is\nwarranted as claimed by the State in cross-appeals . The prosecution\nhas utterly failed in establishing a complete chain of circumstances\nbeyond doubt let alone beyond reasonable doubt and therefore, the\naccused/appellants would be entitled to the benefit of the doubt. In\nsupport of the aforesaid grounds, Shri Rawal has placed reliance over\nthe following judgments passed by the Apex Court;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1505859\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1339608\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1801212\" id=\"span_7\"><a href=\"/doc/1801212/\" id=\"a_62\">1/.Thimma and Thimma Raju Vs.

Per contra Ms. Bharti Lakkad learned Government Advocate\nappearing for the respondents/State has argued in support of the\njudgments as well as appeals filed against the acquittal of other\naccused by submitting that appellants Ghanshyam, Bindu @ Puskar\nand Mukesh have rightly been convicted by the trial court as they\nkidnapped Bharat (deceased No.1), Shobaram (deceased No.2) and\nShantilal (deceased No.3) and after committed their murder thereafter\nburied near the Maleni river. The dead bodies were recovered on the\ndisclosure of Mukesh Dhakad . Motorcycle in two parts was recovered\nfrom the house of Bindu and Ghanshyam. The learned trial court has\nwrongly acquitted the Ramchandra at whose instance the Mukesh and\nothers murdered Bharat (deceased No.1), Shobaram (deceased No.2)\nand Shantilal. Ramchandra was feeling insecure in respect of the\nproperties of his natural son, therefore, he hired Mukesh to murder\nBharat (deceased No.1). Thereafter, he murdered Shobaram (deceased\nNo.2) and Shantilal (deceased No.3) upon being given Rs. 3,00,000/-\nby Ramchandra. There are recoveries from the other accused, who\nshared the common intention with the Mukesh and Ramchandra.\nHence the appeals filed against the conviction are liable to be\ndismissed and appeals filed against the acquittal are liable to be\nallowed.

According\nto Mukesh, he wanted to kill Shobhara but Shantilal (deceased No.3)\ncame and Ramchandra has told to kill Shantilal (deceased No.3) also\nfor which he would be given Rs. 1,00,000/- in addition. He has further\nconfirmed that Shantilal (deceased No.3) was having a red colour\nmotorcycle.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">(32). According to Shivkanya (PW-11), the missing person report of\nBharat (deceased No.1) was lodged by her husband Shobharam. Bharat\n(deceased No.1) was searched by Ramchandra, his son and her\nhusband Shobhram but could not be found. Bharat (deceased No.1)\nwas brought up by Ramchandra.

Thereafter he was searched in the house of relatives but for 4\nmonths but could not be found. One day Mukesh came and said that he\nsaw the Bharat (deceased No.1) at Village Namli. Mukesh told her\nhusband to arrange Rs. 7,00,000/- for release of the Mukesh. He took\nher husband with him and returned alone, thereafter Mukesh fled away\nand her husband Shobaram (deceased No.2) did not return. She came\nto know that one day earlier Mukesh took Shantilal (deceased No.3)\nwith him, when he did not return 2-3 days, she lodged a report.\nThereafter Mukesh has disclosed about all the three dead bodies. She\nhas completely denied the involvement of Ramchandra behind all three\nmurders. She has identified the Mukesh in court and according to her,\nhe killed her husband and son. She was cross-examined by the defence\ncounsel and in cross-examination, she stated that when the Mukesh\nwas telling about Bharat (deceased No.1) to Shobhara, her nephew was\nalso present. However, in her police statement, there is no mention of\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">                                 - : 21 :-\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">the demand of Rs.7,00,000/- in the police report.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">(33). The prosecution has examined Nandu as PW-12 and according\nto him, Mukesh was living in the rented house of Azam Khan in the\nvillage . He brought a cassette and played the voice of Bharat\n(deceased No.1) in which he was pleading for saving his life,\nthereafter, Shantilal (deceased No.3) went alongwith Mukesh,\nthereafter, he came back and took Shobaram (deceased No.2) also. The\nsecond day Mukesh returned alone and he asked about Shantilal\n(deceased No.3) and Shobaram (deceased No.2) from Mukesh but he\ndid not give a satisfactory reply, therefore, a report was lodged. In\nview of the aforesaid statement, it is clear that the Shantilal (deceased\nNo.3) and Shobaram (deceased No.2) went along with Mukesh and but\ndid not return. Although the police have recovered the cassette but it\nwas not played during the trial. There was no verification that the\ncassette was containing the voice of Bharat (deceased No.1). above\ntestimony of the three witnesses proves the missing of deceased\nBharat, Shantilal and Shobharam and thereafter recoveries of their\ndead bodies at the disclosure of Mukesh we have no reasons to doubt\ntheir testimony.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">(34). The prosecution has examined Kishore (PW-8), Kantilal @\nKanha (PW-13), Bharat Gupta (PW-14), Vipin (PW-16) and Mangilal\n(PW-19) in order to prove the recovery of three dead bodies. As stated\nabove there is no challenge to the recovery of dead bodies, therefore\nthere is no need to reappreciate the findings recorded by the learned\nAdditional Session Judge. The only argument raised by Shri Rawal is\nthat before the recovery of all three dead bodies, the news had been\nmade viral in the local areas, when the police reached along with the\nMukesh, numbers of local villagers, journalists and photographers\nwere already present on the spot. Therefore, the recoveries of the dead\nbody on disclosure of Mukesh became doubtful. There was a lot of\nagitation against the police in the village because of the missing of\ndeceased Bharat, Shantilal and Shobharam and the police were unable\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">                                - : 22 :-\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">to found them. The politician, journalists were visiting the village,\ntherefore, this investigation was regularly being followed by local\nvillagers and journalists. After the arrest of Mukesh, he disclosed the\nlocation of the dead bodies buried by him in his memorandum\nstatement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_70\">section 27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act. The\nmunicipal corporation employees were called for digging the land\nhence information to the Chief Municipal Officer was send in advance.\nThe news might have been leaked and residents, media persons etc\nreached there before reaching the police. Therefore that would not be\nrendered the disclosure by the Mukesh doubtful or inadmissible.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">(35). However, the area near and agricultural field of Nathu was\nbarren land. Even after reaching there, it was impossible for the police\nto dig the entire land to find out the exact location of the grave three\ndead bodies. On specific locations disclosed of three graves disclosed\nby the Mukesh, three areas were dug and all three bodies of deceased\nBharat, Shantilal and Shobharam (deceased No.           1 to 3) were\nrecovered. Therefore, there is no reason to doubt the investigation\ncarried out by the police in respect of the search of dead bodies on\ndisclosure by Mukesh. Because of the presence of villagers and the\nmedia persons, we have no reason to discard the recoveries of dead\nbodies by the police at the instance of Mukesh. After recovery of the\ndead bodies, wire and cloths were found around their necks. All the\nbodies were found in a decomposed condition. The clothes, shoes of\ndeceased Bharat, Shantilal and Shobharam did not decompose. All\nthree deceased Bharat, Shantilal and Shobharam were identified by\ncloths and other identification marks by their relatives. Their cause of\ndeath has been affirmed in the postmortem report. The missing of\ndeceased Bharat, Shantilal and Shobharamfrom the village is not\ndisputed hence identification of three dead bodies cannot be disputed\nfor want of DNA test.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">(36). Shri Rawat learned counsel has submitted that the conduct of\nShantilal (deceased No.3) and Shobaram (deceased No.2) and Nandu\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">                                - : 23 :-\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">was unnatural because upon discloser by Mukesh that he saw Bharat\n(deceased No.1) and brought the cassette then they should have taken\nhim to the police. They did not ask Mukesh as to from where he got\nthis cassette, therefore, the story of prosecution about bringing the\ncassette of Bharat (deceased No.1) by Mukesh become doubtful. The\naforesaid witnesses have clearly deposed that Mukesh came and gave\ninformation about Bharat (deceased No.1) and thereafter took Shantilal\n(deceased No.3)and Shobaram (deceased No.2) by one by one and all\ndid not return but Mukesh returned alone. Thereafter, the FIRs were\nlodged. The conduct of Shobaram (deceased No.2) and Shantilal\n(deceased No.3) was quite natural as they were worried about the\nmissing of Bharat (deceased No.1) for the last four months hence\nimmediately they have followed Mukesh to know the whereabouts of\nBharat (deceased No.1). Their testimony remained unrebutted thus we\nhave no reason to disbelieve these witnesses.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">(37). Mukesh was arrested and on his disclosure, all three dead bodies\nwere recovered from the open place. The prosecution has successfully\nproved its cases by collecting sufficient evidence to establish the\nculpability of accused Mukesh in this case. Hence, we hereby confirm\nthe conviction and sentence of Mukesh in murder of Bharat (deceased\nNo.1), Shobaram (deceased No.2) and Shantilal ( deceased No 3).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">(38). So far as the conviction of Bindu @ Puskar and Ghanshyam are\nconcerned, they have been convicted because the motorcycle of\nShantilal (deceased No.3) was found in two parts in their house. Apart\nfrom this, there is no evidence that they hatched common intention/\nobject with Mukesh in murdering Bharat (deceased No.1), Shobaram\n(deceased No.2) and Shantilal ( deceased No 3). In order to connect\nthem in these cases, the only material collected by the police is the\nmotorcycle. There was no reason for removing the front wheel and\ngiven to Ghanshyam and retaining the remaining motorcycle by Bindu\n@ Puskar and buried in their house.

The credibility of the witnesses is an\nimportant aspect. The chance witness should be given due regard.\nExtrajudicial confessional statement of co-accused cannot be solely\nutilized to convict a person. Circumstantial evidence is those facts,\nwhich the court may infer further. There is a stark contrast between\ndirect evidence and circumstantial evidence. In cases of circumstantial\nevidence, the courts are called upon to make inferences from the\navailable evidence, which may lead to the accused&#x27;s guilt. In the\nmajority of cases, the inference of guilt is usually drawn by\nestablishing the case from its initiation to the point of commission\nwherein each factual link is ultimately based on evidence of a fact or\nan inference thereof. Therefore, the courts have to identify the facts in\nthe first place to fit the case within the parameters of &#x27;chain link\ntheory&#x27; and then see whether the case is made out beyond reasonable\ndoubt.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">(48). In the case of Digamber Vaishnav (supra), the Apex Court has\nheld that even if the offence is a shocking one, the gravity of offence\ncannot by itself overweigh as far as legal proof is concerned. In cases\ndepending highly upon the circumstantial evidence, there is always a\ndanger that the conjecture or suspicion may take the place of legal\nproof. The court has to be watchful and ensure that the conjecture and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">                                - : 28 :-\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">suspicion do not take the place of legal proof. The court must satisfy\nitself that various circumstances in the chain of evidence should be\nestablished clearly and that the completed chain must be such as to\nrule out a reasonable likelihood of the innocence of the accused. The\nthree conditions must be satisfied which are as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">     i.) the circumstances from which an inference of guilt is\n     sought to be drawn, must be cogently and firmly established;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">     ii.) those circumstances should be of a definite tendency\n     unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused; and\n\n     iii.) the circumstances, taken cumulatively, should form a\n     chain so complete that there is no escape from the\n     conclusion that within all human probability the crime was\n     committed by the accused and none else, and it should also\n     be incapable of explanation on any other hypothesis than\n     that of the guilt of the accused.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">(49). In the case of Digamber Vaishnav (supra), the Apex Court has\nheld that in a case based on circumstantial evidence it is always better\nfor the courts to deal with each circumstance separately and then link\nthe circumstances which have been proved to conclude. The Apex\nCourt has summarized the law in case of circumstantial evidence,\nwhich are as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">     1. The circumstances relied upon by the prosecution which\n     lead to an inference to the guilt of the accused must be\n     proved beyond doubt;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">     2. The circumstances should unerringly point towards the\n     guilt of the accused;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">     3. The circumstances should be linked together in such a\n     manner that the cumulative effect of the chain formed by\n     joining the links is so complete that it leads to only one\n     conclusion i.e. the guilt of the accused;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">     4.

Apart from this nothing has been\n                 collected by the prosecution to connect the other accused in the triple\n                 murder.
