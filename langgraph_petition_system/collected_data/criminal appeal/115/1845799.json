The appellant (accused) and the\n\n     respondent (complainant) are employed as High School assistants\n\n     in SSHSS school in Moorkanand. The respondent has filed a\n\n     complaint against the appellant before the learned Magistrate for\n\n     an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act\n\n     (the `Act&#x27; for short). The complainant&#x27;s case is that the appellant,\n\n     who was due in a sum of Rs.5,00,000/-, issued a cheque dated\n\n     16.06.2003 in respect of that liability, and when the cheque was\n\n     presented for encashment, the same was returned with an\n\n     endorsement of &quot;insufficiency of funds.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">5)         The complainant, through his Advocate, had issued notice to\n\n     the appellant demanding the payment and that in spite of the\n\n     service of notice, the appellant failed to pay the amount covered by\n\n     the cheque and thus has committed an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 138</a>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                      <a href=\"/doc/328668/\" id=\"a_3\">2</a></span>\n\f     of the Act and, accordingly, has approached the learned Magistrate\n\n     for appropriate reliefs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">6)        The learned Magistrate after taking cognizance of the offence\n\n     and after recording the evidence of the parties and after analyzing\n\n     the same, has found the accused guilty of the offence punishable\n\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 138</a> of the Act and sentenced to simple\n\n     imprisonment for one year. In addition to that he had directed to\n\n     pay a compensation of Rs. 5 lakhs to the complainant under\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/640437/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 357(3)</a> of the Cr.PC, and in default, to undergo simple\n\n     imprisonment for a further period of two months.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">7)          The accused filed appeal before the Sessions Court, Manjeri\n\n     being Criminal Appeal No. 59 of 2004. The Sessions Court while\n\n     entertaining the appeal had directed the petitioner to deposit Rs.\n\n     one lakh within one month being a part of the compensation\n\n     amount. The appellant has complied with that order by depositing\n\n     the amount as directed before the Judicial 1st Class Magistrate,\n\n     Manjeri. Eventually, the Sessions Judge by his order dated\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                     3</span>\n\f     21.03.2006 confirmed the judgment of conviction and sentence\n\n     passed by learned Magistrate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">8)             The accused preferred revision petition being Criminal\n\n     Revision Petition No. 1387 of 2006 before the High Court of\n\n     Kerala at Ernakulam. The High Court passed an interim order\n\n     directing the petitioner to deposit an amount of Rs. 1 lakh before\n\n     the Judicial Magistrate and, accordingly, the said amount was also\n\n     deposited. The High Court while disposing of the Revision Petition\n\n     has observed that the courts below had appreciated the facts\n\n     correctly and there is no error, illegality or impropriety in the\n\n     finding recorded by the courts below to set aside the conviction\n\n     and sentence. The High court has further stated that the only\n\n     question which requires to be answered is, whether a proper\n\n     sentence has been imposed on the accused by the courts below.\n\n     The court after taking into consideration the peculiar facts and\n\n     circumstances of the case has modified the sentence imposed on\n\n     the accused to the extent, that, if the petitioner pays the\n\n     compensation amount of Rs. 4 lakhs (keeping in mind that the\n\n     petitioner had deposited an amount of Rs. 1 lakh before the trial\n\n     court towards the compensation amount) within a period of five\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                    4</span>\n\f     months, then he needs to undergo imprisonment only till the rising\n\n     of the court and if the petitioner commits default in making the\n\n     payment aforesaid, he shall undergo simple imprisonment for three\n\n     months by way of default sentence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">9)          Being aggrieved, the accused is before this court by way of\n\n     Criminal Appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 334 of 2008. The\n\n     main contention of the accused is that this court in Criminal\n\n     Appeal No. 1013 of 2007 has held, that, while exercising\n\n     jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/640437/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 357(3)</a> of the Cr.PC, no direction can be\n\n     issued that in default of payment of compensation, the accused\n\n     shall suffer simple imprisonment. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"136736994\" id=\"span_5\">In effect the Supreme Court has\n\n     confirmed the judgment passed in the case of <a href=\"/doc/136736994/\" id=\"a_7\">Radhakrishna Nair v.\n\n     Padmanabhan</a> [(2000) 2 KLT 349], wherein the Kerala High Court\n\n     had given a similar finding. The accused also contends, that, there\n\n     is a factual error in the judgment of the High court to the effect that\n\n     the accused had already deposited Rs. 2 lakhs towards paying the\n\n     compensation amount pursuant to interim orders of the Sessions\n\n     Court and the High Court respectively, instead the High Court has\n\n     observed that only Rs. 1 lakh has been deposited.</span>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                         5</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">\f10)         The complainant being aggrieved by the sentence imposed on\n\n      the accused has filed SLP (Crl) No. 4099 of 2008. The contention\n\n      of the complainant is that, the sentence imposed is very minimal\n\n      and will defeat the very purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 138</a> of N.I Act and if\n\n      for any reason the default sentence is deleted then there is no\n\n      chance of the accused paying the compensation . <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1651003\" id=\"span_7\">In this regard, the\n\n      complainant relies on the observation of this court in the case of\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1651003/\" id=\"a_9\">Suganthi Suresh Kumar v.

The learned counsel\n\n      for the accused submits, that, the default sentence imposed by the\n\n      learned Judge of the High Court is against the dicta of this Court in\n\n      the    case   of   ETTAPPADAN         AHAMMED         KUTTY       @\n\n      KUNHAPPU VS. E.P. ABDULLAKEYA @ KUNHI BAPPU\n\n      AND ANOTHER (Criminal Appeal No. 1031 of 2007).                  Per\n\n      contra, the learned counsel for the respondent ably justifies the\n\n      impugned judgment.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1651003\" id=\"span_8\">The learned counsel also relies on the\n\n      observations made by this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1651003/\" id=\"a_10\">Suganthi Suresh\n\n      Kumar Vs.

State of Punjab (AIR\n\n      1978 SC 1525), this court has noticed the object and genesis of the\n\n      section.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">         &quot;10. The law which enables the Court to direct\n         compensation to be paid to the dependants is found in\n         <a href=\"/doc/1705664/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 357</a> of the CrPC (Act 2 of 1974). The\n         corresponding provision in the 1898 Code was Section\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">         545. <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 545</a> of the CrPC (Act 5 of 1898) was\n         amended by Act 18 of 1923 and by Act 26 of 1955. The\n         amendment which is relevant for the purpose of our\n         discussion is 545(1)(bb) which, for the first time was\n         inserted by Act 26 of 1955. By this amendment the court\n         is enabled to direct the accused, who caused the death of\n         another person, to pay compensation to the persons who\n         are, under the <a href=\"/doc/594667/\" id=\"a_16\">Fatal Accidents Act</a>, entitled to recover\n         damages from the persons sentenced, for the loss\n         resulting to them from such death. In introducing the\n         amendment, the Joint Select Committee stated &quot;when\n         death has been caused to a person, it is but proper that his\n         heirs and dependants should be compensated, in suitable\n         cases, for the loss resulting to them from such death, by\n         the person who was responsible for it. The Committee\n         proceeded to state that though Section 545 of the Code as\n         amended in 1923 was intended to cover such cases, the\n         intention was not however very clearly brought out and\n         therefore in order to focus the attention of the courts on\n         this aspect of the question, the Committee have amended\n         Section 545 and it has been made clear that a fine may\n         form a part of any sentence including a sentence of death\n         and it has also been provided that the persons who are\n         entitled under the <a href=\"/doc/594667/\" id=\"a_17\">Fatal Accidents Act, 1855</a>, to recover\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                        9</span>\n\fdamages from the person sentenced may be compensated\nout of the fine imposed. It also expressed its full\nagreement with the suggestion that at the time of\nawarding judgment in a case where death has resulted\nfrom homicide, the court should award compensation to\nthe heirs of the deceased. The Committee felt that this\nwill result in settling the claim once for all by doing away\nwith the need for a further claim to a civil Court, and\navoid needless worry and expense to both sides. The\nCommittee further agreed that in cases where the death is\nthe result of negligence of the offender, appropriate\ncompensation should be awarded to the heirs. By the\nintroduction of Clause (bb) to Section 545(1), the\nintention of the legislature was made clear that, in\nsuitable cases, the heirs and dependents should be\ncompensated for the loss that resulted to them from the\ndeath, from a person who was responsible for it. The\nview was also expressed that the court should award\ncompensation to the heir of the deceased so that their\nclaims would be settled finally. This object is sought to\nbe given effect to by Section 357 of the new Code (Act 2\nof 1973). Section 357(3) provides that when a court\nimposes a sentence, of which fine does not form a part,\nthe Court may, when passing judgment, order the\naccused person to pay, by way of compensation, such\namount, as may be specified in the order, to the person\nwho has suffered any Joss or injury by reason of the act\nfor which the accused person has been so sentenced. The\nobject of the section therefore, is to provide\ncompensation payable to the persons who are entitled to\nrecover damages from the person sentenced even though\nfine does not form part of the sentence. Though Section\n545 of 1898 Code enabled the court only to pay\ncompensation out of the fine that would be imposed\nunder the law, by Section 357(3) when a Court imposes a\nsentence, of which fine does not form a part, the Court\nmay direct the accused to pay compensation. In awarding\ncompensation it is necessary for the court to decide\nwhether the case is a fit one in which compensation has\nto be awarded. If it is found that compensation should be\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                               1</span>\n\f         paid, then the capacity of the accused to pay a\n         compensation has to be determined. In directing\n         compensation, the object is to collect the fine and pay it\n         to the person who has suffered the loss. The purpose will\n         not be served if the accused is not able to pay the fine or\n         compensation for, imposing a default sentence for non-\n         payment of fine would not achieve the object. If the\n         accused is in a position to pay the compensation to the\n         injured or his dependents to which they are entitled to,\n         there could be no reason for the Court not directing such\n         compensation. When a person, who caused injury due to\n         negligence or is made vicariously liable is bound to pay\n         compensation it is only appropriate to direct payment by\n         the accused who is guilty of causing an injury with the\n         necessary Mens Rea to pay compensation for the person\n         who has suffered injury.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1559334\" id=\"span_14\">18)        In <a href=\"/doc/1559334/\" id=\"a_18\">Balraj v.

In this case, we are\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                       1</span>\n\f      not concerned with Sub-section (1). We are concerned only with\n\n      Sub-section (3). It is an important provision but Courts have\n\n      seldom invoked it. Perhaps due to ignorance of the object of it. It\n\n      empowers the Court to award compensation to victims while\n\n      passing judgment of conviction. In addition to conviction, the\n\n      Court may order the accused to pay some amount by way of\n\n      compensation to victim who has suffered by the action of accused.\n\n      It may be noted that this power of Courts to award compensation is\n\n      not ancillary to other sentences but it is in addition thereto. This\n\n      power was intended to do something to reassure the victim that he\n\n      or she is not forgotten in the criminal justice system. It is a\n\n      measure of responding appropriately to crime as well of\n\n      reconciling the victim with the offender. It is, to some extent, a\n\n      constructive approach to crimes. It is indeed a step forward in our\n\n      criminal justice system.

The\n         quantum of compensation may be determined by taking\n         into account the nature of crime, the justness of claim by\n         the victim and the ability of accused to pay. If there are\n         more than one accused they may be asked to pay in equal\n         terms unless their capacity to pay varies considerably.\n         The payment may also vary depending upon the acts of\n         each accused.

The sentence is\n         something which an offender must undergo unless it is\n         set aside or remitted in part or in whole either in appeal\n         or in revision or in other appropriate judicial proceedings\n         or &quot;otherwise&quot;. A term of imprisonment ordered in\n         default of payment of fine stands on a different footing.\n         A person is required to undergo imprisonment either\n         because he is unable to pay the amount of fine or refuses\n         to pay such amount. He, therefore, can always avoid to\n         undergo imprisonment in default of payment of fine by\n         paying such amount. It is, therefore, not only the power,\n         but the duty of the court to keep in view the nature of\n         offence, circumstances under which it was committed,\n         the position of the offender and other relevant\n         considerations before ordering the offender to suffer\n         imprisonment in default of payment of fine.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"572744\" id=\"span_37\">26)      In <a href=\"/doc/572744/\" id=\"a_46\">Kuldip Kaur v.

Sentencing a person to jail\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                                                       1</span>\n\f         is a &#x27;mode of enforcement&#x27;. It is not a &#x27;mode of\n         satisfaction&#x27; of the liability. The liability can be satisfied\n         only by making actual payment of the arrears. The whole\n         purpose of sending to jail is to oblige a person liable to\n         pay the monthly allowance who refuses to comply with\n         the order without sufficient cause, to obey the order and\n         to make the payment. The purpose of sending him to jail\n         is not to wipe out the liability which he has refused to\n         discharge. Be it also realised that a person ordered to pay\n         monthly allowance can be sent to jail only if he fails to\n         pay monthly allowance &#x27;without sufficient cause&#x27; to\n         comply with the order. It would indeed be strange to hold\n         that a person who &#x27;without reasonable cause&#x27; refuses to\n         comply with the order of the Court to maintain his\n         neglected wife or child would be absolved of his liability\n         merely because he prefers to go to jail. A sentence of jail\n         is no substitute for the recovery of the amount of monthly\n         allowance which has fallen in arrears.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"572744\" id=\"span_39\">27)        From the above line of cases, it becomes very clear, that, a\n\n      sentence of imprisonment can be granted for default in payment of\n\n      compensation awarded under <a href=\"/doc/640437/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 357(3)</a> of Cr.PC. The whole\n\n      purpose of the provision is to accommodate the interests of the\n\n      victims in the criminal justice system. Sometimes the situation\n\n      becomes such that there is no purpose is served by keeping a\n\n      person behind bars. Instead directing the accused to pay an amount\n\n      of compensation to the victim or affected party can ensure delivery\n\n      of total justice. Therefore, this grant of compensation is sometimes\n\n      in lieu of sending a person behind bars or in addition to a very light\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                                                          1</span>\n\f      sentence of imprisonment. Hence on default of payment of this\n\n      compensation, there must be a just recourse. Not imposing a\n\n      sentence of imprisonment would mean allowing the accused to get\n\n      away without paying the compensation and imposing another fine\n\n      would be impractical as it would mean imposing a fine upon\n\n      another fine and therefore would not ensure proper enforcement of\n\n      the order of compensation. While passing an order under Section\n\n      357(3), it is imperative for the courts to look at the ability and the\n\n      capacity of the accused to pay the same amount as has been <a href=\"/doc/572744/\" id=\"a_49\">laid\n\n      down by</a> the cases above, otherwise the very purpose of granting\n\n      an order of compensation would stand defeated.</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">28)       <a href=\"/doc/89440/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 421</a> of Cr.PC reads:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">         &quot;421.

Section 421 further provides the mode of recovery of a\n\n      fine and the section clearly provides that a person can be\n\n      imprisoned for non-payment of fine. Therefore, going by the\n\n      provisions of the code, the intention of the legislature is clearly to\n\n      ensure that mode of recovery of a fine and compensation is on the\n\n      same footing. In light of the aforesaid reasoning, the contention of\n\n      the accused that there can be no sentence of imprisonment for\n\n      default in payment of compensation under Section 357 (3) should\n\n      fail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">30)           A similar position is also prevalent in other countries.

In our considered view, looking into\n\n      the facts and circumstances of the case and the nature of the\n\n      offence, we find no good reason to interfere with the quantum of\n\n      sentence imposed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">34)         The contention of the accused as regards a factual error made\n\n      by the High Court, wherein the High Court stated that the accused\n\n      had deposited Rs. 1 lakh towards the compensation amount\n\n      requires to be accepted. It is to be noted that the accused has\n\n      already deposited Rs.2 lakhs towards the compensation amount of\n\n      Rs. 5 lakhs, before the Judicial Magistrate in pursuance of orders\n\n      passed by the Sessions Court and the High Court. Therefore, the\n\n      appeal of the accused, i.e. Criminal Appeal arising out of Special\n\n      Leave Petition (Crl.)
