NAGESWARA RAO, J.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">      The Sessions Court, Thrissur convicted A1 to A4,  A14,  A15,  and  A18\nunder Section 302  read  with  149  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_1\">Indian  Penal  Code</a>,  1860  (hereinafter\nreferred to as the ‘<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>’) and  sentenced  them  to  imprisonment  for  life.\nThey were also convicted for offences under <a href=\"/doc/1096965/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 143</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_4\">147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_5\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1599401/\" id=\"a_6\">341</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1243353/\" id=\"a_7\">342</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_8\">324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_9\">149</a> IPC.  A5 to A13, A16 and A17 were acquitted. A1 to A4, A14,  A15\nand A18 who were convicted,  filed  an  Appeal  before  the  High  Court  of\nKerala.  The State of Kerala and the complainant (father  of  the  deceased)\nalso filed appeals against the order of acquittal of  A5  to  A13,  A16  and\nA17.  By way of abundant caution  the  complainant  also  filed  a  Criminal\nRevision challenging the acquittal of the said  accused.   The  judgment  of\nthe Trial Court acquitting A5 to A13, A16 and A17 was confirmed by the  High\nCourt.   A1 was convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 302</a> and  sentenced  to  imprisonment\nfor life.   A2 and A4 were convicted under  <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_11\">Section  324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_12\">149</a>  IPC  and  were\nsentenced to imprisonment of 1 year.

The\ncomplainant filed an appeal against the acquittal of A2 to A4, A14, A15  and\nA18.  He also filed an appeal challenging the acquittal of A5  to  A13,  A16\nand A17.  The State of Kerala also assailed the acquittal of A2 to A4,  A14,\nA15 and A18 by filing an appeal.  It is relevant to take note  of  the  fact\nthat initially 21 persons were named as accused.  A21 absconded and A19  and\nA20 died during the course of trial.   A1, A2, A5 and A12  died  during  the\npendency of the appeals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.    The case of the prosecution was that PW-14, a Head Constable  attached\nto Kunnamkulam Police Station, received a  phone  call  in  the  evening  on\n10.03.1993 that there was a fight  going  on  at  Ottappilavu  centre.    He\nalong with two other police men reached the place of the incident and  found\na person lying on the road margin on the western side of the  road.   As  he\nwas unconscious and was bleeding due  to  injuries,  he  was  taken  to  the\nGovernment hospital, Kunnamkulam  for  treatment  in  a  police  jeep.   The\nDoctor examined him  and  declared  him  dead.    As  the  identity  of  the\ndeceased was not known, PW 14 kept the body in the mortuary,  went  back  to\nthe police station and recorded the  details  in  the  General  Diary.   The\nFirst Information Statement of PW-1  Krishnankutty  was  recorded  at  12:00\nmidnight on 10.03.1993.  He stated that there was a dispute  between  people\nbelonging to RSS and CPI (Marxist) party in connection with the festival  at\nKorattikara Vishnu Bhagwati Temple.  He further stated that at  about  08:15\npm on 10.03.1993 when he was  walking  back  home  and  reached  Ottappilavu\ncentre he saw A2 to A5, A13,  A19  and  A21  along  with  number  of  others\nattacking Suresh Babu.  He also stated  that  Suresh  Babu  was  stabbed  to\ndeath by A13 and others.   On the basis of the First  Information  Statement\nFIR No.95 of  1993  was  registered  at  Kunnamkulam  Police  Station  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1096965/\" id=\"a_13\">Section  143</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_14\">147</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_15\">148</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1599401/\" id=\"a_16\">341</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_17\">324</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_18\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_19\">149</a>  IPC  at  12:00  midnight  on\n10.03.1993 by PW15.  Inquest was conducted between 9:45 am to  12:45  pm  by\nPW15.   The Assistant Professor of Forensic  Medicine  at  Medical  College,\nThrissur (PW13) conducted the autopsy immediately  thereafter.    The  post-\nmortem certificate referred to 26 injuries  on  the  body  of  the  deceased\nSuresh Babu and the cause of death was  stated  as  “the  deceased  died  of\nmultiple injuries sustained to chest”.  The FIR was sent to  the  Magistrate\nin the morning on 11.03.1993.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.    Not satisfied with the investigation, Madhavan (PW12), the  father  of\nthe deceased filed a private complaint on  01.04.1994  before  the  Judicial\nMagistrate 1st Class, Kunnamkulam. He  along  with  4  other  witnesses  was\nexamined and process was issued to the accused  persons.  PW4  Chandran  was\nmentioned as a witness in the complaint. On 08.09.1994,  Madhavan  submitted\nanother list of witnesses in which PW5 and PW6 were included.  The cases  of\nthe  prosecution  and  the  private  complainant  were  consolidated.    The\nSessions Court directed the prosecution to submit a  schedule  of  witnesses\nwhich would include the witnesses mentioned in the private  complaint  also.\nThe consolidated list of witnesses given by the  prosecution  included  PW4,\nPW5 and PW6.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.    After completion of investigation, all the accused  were  charged  for\ncommitting offences under <a href=\"/doc/1096965/\" id=\"a_20\">Sections  143</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_21\">147</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_22\">148</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1599401/\" id=\"a_23\">341</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_24\">323</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_25\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_26\">149</a>\nIPC.  As stated earlier A19 and A20 died during the course of trial and  A21\nabsconded.  The other accused pleaded not guilty  and  were  tried  for  the\naforementioned offences.   There were 16 witnesses  examined  on  behalf  of\nthe prosecution and 3 witnesses by the defence. PW1 Krishnankutty,  who  was\nthe informant and PW2 Gopinathan  who  was  an  eyewitness  turned  hostile.\nLikewise, PW-8 Sulalman, PW9 Ashraf and PW10 Francis who were  attestors  to\nthe scene mahazar and seizure of  the  weapon  also  turned  hostile.   PW11\nKuttikrishan who was the driver  of  the  bus  in  which  the  deceased  was\ntravelling also turned hostile.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">5.    The testimony of PW3 was  examined  in  detail  by  the  Trial  Court.\nAfter considering the submissions on behalf of the defence, the Trial  Court\nheld that the evidence of PW3 Subramanian  was  consistent,  cogent  and  in\nconformity with the prosecution case.  The Trial Court  held  that  PW4  was\nalso a credible witness.    According  to  the  Trial  Court  there  was  no\nmaterial contradiction brought out in the evidence of PW5 Balan who  was  an\neyewitness.   PW6 Velayudhan was found to be  a  doubtful  witness  and  the\nTrial Court held that it was not safe to rely on his evidence.    The  Trial\nCourt concluded that there was corroboration to the oral  testimony  of  PW3\nto PW5 from the  medical  evidence.    The  oral  evidence  showed  that  A1\nstabbed on the left side of the back of the deceased  which  corresponds  to\ninjury No.24.  The other stab injuries inflicted by A1 and A21 as  mentioned\nby the eyewitness also correspond to the stab injuries  in  Exh.P-11  (post-\nmortem certificate).  Injury No.24 had the  depth  of  7.5  c.m.  caused  by\nknife which entered the  left  chest  cavity  through  the  5th  intercostal\nspace.  It terminated at the upper part of lower  lobe  of  the  left  lung.\nThe Doctor opined that this injury was sufficient in the ordinary course  of\nnature to cause death.   The  Trial  Court  held  that  A1  had  a  definite\nintention to kill  the  deceased.   Considering  the  fact  that  the  other\naccused continued to beat the deceased with sticks even  after  stabbing  by\nA1 and A21, the Trial Court held that there was a common  object  of  murder\non the part of the accused.  A5 to A13, A16 and A17 were  acquitted  by  the\nTrial Court as there was no evidence against them.  A1 to A4, A14,  A15  and\nA18 were convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_28\">149</a> IPC and sentenced  to  imprisonment\nfor life.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">6.    The appeals filed by the convicted accused, the appeals filed  by  the\nState and the complainant against the acquittal of some accused  were  taken\nup along with the Criminal Revision filed by  the  complainant  against  the\nacquittal.  The High Court discarded the evidence of PW5 and PW6.  The  High\nCourt held that PW3 is a trustworthy witness and PW4’s evidence can be  used\nfor corroboration.  Placing reliance on the evidence of  PW3  and  PW4,  the\nHigh Court upheld the conviction of A1 under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_29\">Section  302</a>  IPC.    The  High\nCourt also held A2 and A4 guilty of  an  offence  punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_30\">Section\n324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_31\">149</a> IPC by acquitting them of an  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_32\">Section  302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_33\">149</a>  IPC.\nA3, A14, A15 and A18 were acquitted for offences under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_34\">Section  302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_35\">149</a>  IPC\nby the High Court.  The acquittal of other accused A5 to A13,  A16  and  A17\nrecorded by the Trial Court was confirmed  by  the  High  Court.   The  High\nCourt  referred  to  the  remand  report  dated  17.03.1993  of  the  Circle\nInspector in which it was recorded that on 10.03.1993  sympathisers  of  CPI\n(M) were attacked by the followers of BJP at Ottappilavu.  In that  incident\nMoidunny,  Ali,  Subramannian,  Shameer  and  Kunhikoya  sustained   serious\ninjuries and crime No.96 of 1993 in the  Kunnamkulam  Police  Station  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1096965/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 143</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_37\">147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_38\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_39\">323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_40\">324</a>, <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_41\">307</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_42\">149</a> IPC  was  registered.   There  were\nthree other cases which were registered against the sympathisers of CPI  (M)\nfor incidents that took place at 06:15 pm on the same day.   Taking note  of\nthe series of clashes on 10.03.1993, the High Court repelled the  submission\nof the defence about the unexplained delay in filing  of  the  FIR  and  the\ndelay in the FIR reaching the Magistrate only on the next  day.    The  High\nCourt relying upon the judgments of this Court held  that  the  recovery  of\nweapon not  being  proved  is  not  fatal  to  the  prosecution  case.   The\nsubmission made on behalf  of  the  accused  that  PW3  and  PW4  cannot  be\nbelieved on the ground that their  conduct  was  contrary  to  normal  human\nbehaviour was also rejected on the ground that there cannot be any  straight\njacket formula for the reaction of a person who  had  witnessed  a  criminal\nact.  The High Court relied upon the judgments of this  Court  in  which  it\nwas held that human behaviour is unpredictable and there is no set  rule  of\nnatural reaction.   The defence  witnesses  were  disbelieved  by  the  High\nCourt.  All the accused except A1, A2 and  A4  were  acquitted  of  all  the\ncharges against them on the ground that the prosecution was unable to  prove\nthe common object of the unlawful assembly for the murder of Suresh Babu.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">7.    The complainant filed Criminal  Appeal  No.400  of  2006  against  the\nacquittal of A2 to A4, A14, A15 and A18.   He  also  filed  Criminal  Appeal\nNo.661 of 2006 assailing the acquittal of A5  to  A13,  A16  and  A17.   The\nState of Kerala has filed Criminal Appeal No.141  of  2007  challenging  the\njudgment of the High Court by  which  A2  to  A4,  A14,  A15  and  A18  were\nacquitted.   A1 also approached this Court by filing an Appeal  against  his\nconviction under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 302</a> IPC.  However, the said appeal abated  in  view\nof the death of A1.  We have heard Mr.Basant R., learned Senior Counsel  for\nthe appellant/ complainant in  Criminal  Appeal  Nos.400  of  2006,  Mr.  G.\nPrakash, Advocate for the State of Kerala in Crl. Appeal  No.  141  of  2007\nand Mr. Siddharth Luthra, learned Senior  Counsel  for  the  accused.    Mr.\nBasant submitted that the  complainant  was  compelled  to  file  a  private\ncomplaint in view of  the  perfunctory  investigation  into  the  murder  of\nSuresh  Babu.   He  submitted  that  there  was  a  consolidation   of   the\nprosecution case and the case filed by the  complainant  under  <a href=\"/doc/788422/\" id=\"a_44\">Section  210</a>\nCr.P.C.  He further submitted that a  consolidated  list  of  witnesses  was\nprepared.    According  to  the  learned  Senior  Counsel,  the  High  Court\ncommitted  a  serious  error  in  eschewing  the  evidence   of   PW5   from\nconsideration.   He also stated that the evidence of PW4  should  have  been\nrelied upon by the High Court instead of using  it  only  for  corroborating\nthe evidence of PW3.  He urged that the High Court  erred  in  holding  that\nthe common object of the accused was  not  proved.    He  also  argued  that\nadmittedly there was a homicide and A1 was convicted for causing  the  death\nof Suresh Babu.   The High Court also  convicted  A2  and  A4  for  offences\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1096965/\" id=\"a_45\">Sections 143</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_46\">147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_47\">148</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_48\">324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_49\">149</a>  IPC.   He  submitted  that  all  the\naccused are liable for conviction under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_51\">149</a> IPC especially  when\nA2 and A4 were convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1096965/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 143</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_53\">147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_54\">148</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_55\">324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_56\">149</a>  IPC  and  A1\nconvicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 302</a> IPC.  Mr.G.Prakash, Advocate, appearing for  the\nState of Kerala adopted the submissions made by Mr. Basant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">8.    Mr.  Siddharth  Luthra,  learned  Senior  Counsel  appearing  for  the\naccused took us through the evidence of PW4, PW5 and PW6 and submitted  that\nthey are all interested  witnesses  who  deposed  at  the  instance  of  the\ncomplainant.  He submitted that the informant  PW1  and  another  eyewitness\nPW2 turned hostile.   He stated that the offence  took  place  on  a  public\nroad and no independent eyewitnesses were produced  by  the  prosecution  to\nprove the case.  He further submitted that apart from PW4 no  other  witness\ncited in the private complaint was examined.  The  partisan  and  interested\ntestimonies of eye witnesses who belonged to the  opposite  political  party\nought not to have been taken into consideration by  the  Courts  below.   He\nalso commented upon the  unnatural  behaviour  of  PW3  and  PW4  after  the\nincident.   Mr. Luthra finally submitted that the appeals against  acquittal\nshould not be interfered lightly by this Court.  In any event, according  to\nhim, when there are two views possible, the  accused  should  be  given  the\nbenefit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">9.    As stated earlier, A1, A2, A5 and A12 died during the pendency of  the\nappeals before this Court.  The remaining accused can  be  categorised  into\nthree groups.  The first group consists of A5 to A13, A16 and A17  who  were\nacquitted both by the Trial Court and the  High  Court.   The  second  group\nconsists of A3, A14, A15 and A18 who  were  convicted  by  the  Trial  Court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_59\">149</a> IPC but acquitted by the High Court.    A4  forms  the\nthird group whose conviction under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_61\">149</a> IPC by  the  Trial  Court\nwas set aside by the High Court.  However, he was  convicted  under  <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_62\">Section\n324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_63\">149</a> IPC and sentenced for a period of 1 year.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">10.   PW3, who was an independent witness  and  was  believed  by  both  the\nCourts below, gave a vivid description of the incident.  He stated  that  he\nwas a resident of Ottappilavu and that he was acquainted with  the  deceased\nSuresh Babu who was residing about 1 k.m. away from his house.   He  deposed\nthat he went to Kunnamkulam to purchase medicines for his  brother  who  was\nunwell.  He boarded a stage carriage bus by name Babu  bus  at  Kunnamkulam.\nThe deceased Suresh Babu was travelling in the same  bus.   He  stated  that\nwhen the bus reached Ottappilavu junction, A1, A2, A4  and  A5  entered  the\nbus, pulled Suresh Babu out of the bus and took him to  the  front  side  of\nthe bus and attacked him.  He  further  stated  that  A1  inflicted  a  stab\ninjury on the back of the left side  of  the  chest  of  Suresh  Babu.   The\ndeceased fell down and A1  inflicted  two  more  stab  injuries.   When  the\ndeceased  was  struggling  to  stand  up  and  escape  the   other   accused\nindiscriminately beat him with a reaper and  sticks.    He  did  not  alight\nfrom the bus and continued his travel and got down at  Chalissery  junction.\n He stated that he  was  questioned  by  the  police  after  two  days.   He\nidentified M.O.1 knife used by A1.   PW4  was  also  an  eyewitness  to  the\nincident.  He stated that A2  to  A4,  A10,  A13,  A14,  A15,  A18  and  A20\nattacked the deceased with sticks and a reaper after A1  and  A21  inflicted\nstab injuries on the deceased.  He stated that his  house  is  situated  2/3\nk.m. from the house of the deceased and that he also  attended  the  funeral\nof Suresh Babu.  He was cited as a witness in the  private  complaint  filed\nby PW12 (appellant).  His statement was recorded  by  the  Magistrate  under\n<a href=\"/doc/162723/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 202</a> Cr. P.C.   PW6 was disbelieved by the Trial Court as well as  by\nthe High Court.  The evidence of PW5 disbelieved by  the  High  Court.   The\nHigh Court acquitted A3, A14, A15 and  A18  of  the  charges  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_65\">Section\n302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_66\">149</a> IPC on two grounds.   The first ground was that PW3 did  not  depose\nabout  their  presence  and  it  was  only  PW4  who  stated   about   their\ninvolvement.  The second ground was that there is no evidence to  show  that\nthe members of the unlawful assembly had a common object to cause the  death\nof Suresh Babu.  Modification of the conviction  and  sentence  of  A4  from\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_68\">149</a> IPC to <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_70\">149</a> IPC was on the  ground  that  A4  who\nwas a member of the unlawful assembly did  not  share  a  common  object  of\ncausing the death of Suresh Babu along with A1 and A21.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">11.   We are of the opinion that the High Court committed  a  serious  error\nin not  taking  into  consideration  the  evidence  of  PW4.    The  finding\nrecorded by the High Court that the evidence of PW4 can be  considered  only\nfor the limited purpose of corroboration of evidence of PW3 is  unreasonable\nand perverse.   After recording a finding that the evidence  of  PW4  cannot\nbe rejected only on the ground that he was not  questioned  by  the  police,\nthe High Court proceeded to hold that the evidence of PW4 can be  used  only\nfor corroboration of PW3’s evidence.  Unlike PW5 and PW6 who were  cited  as\nwitnesses in the second list of witnesses  given  by  the  complainant  five\nmonths after filing of the complaint, PW4 was named  as  a  witness  in  the\ncomplaint.  Further, his statement was  recorded  by  the  Magistrate  under\n<a href=\"/doc/162723/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 202</a> Cr. P.C.  There was a consolidated list of  witnesses  given  by\nthe prosecution.  The High Court has not given any  reason  as  to  why  the\nevidence  of  PW4  can  be  used  only  for  corroboration.   On  a  careful\nexamination of the evidence of PW4 we are of  the  considered  opinion  that\nthe Trial Court was right in relying upon his testimony and the  High  Court\nwas not correct in holding that it can be used  only  for  corroboration  of\nPW3’s evidence.  The finding of the High Court that A3,  A14,  A15  and  A18\nare entitled for acquittal on the basis that PW3 did not speak  about  their\npresence is liable to be set aside as PW4 had categorically mentioned  about\ntheir involvement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1093191\" id=\"span_1\">12.   The High Court held that the accused were not aware that the  deceased\nwas travelling in the bus and there is no evidence to show that they  formed\nan unlawful assembly with a view to attack  and  commit  his  murder.    The\nHigh Court referred to the clash between the supporters of CPI (M)  and  BJP\nworkers on 10.03.1993.  The High Court held that the deceased  was  attacked\ndue to political rivalry but there is no evidence to show that  the  members\nof the unlawful assembly had a common object  to  commit  his  murder.   The\nHigh Court also found that A1 and A21 alone inflicted stab injuries and  the\nother members of the unlawful assembly who caused injuries on the non  vital\nparts cannot be said to have shared the common object of causing  the  death\nof Suresh Babu.  The common object of the unlawful assembly can be  gathered\nfrom the nature of the assembly, arms used by them and the behaviour of  the\nassembly at or before the scene of occurrence.   It is an  inference  to  be\ndeduced from the fact and circumstances of the case (See <a href=\"/doc/1093191/\" id=\"a_72\">Lalji v.  State  of\nU.P.</a>, (1989) 1 SCC 437 ¶8). It is also settled law that  the  mere  presence\nin the unlawful assembly may vicariously  fasten  criminal  liability  under\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 149</a> IPC (See.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1142123\" id=\"span_2\"><a href=\"/doc/1142123/\" id=\"a_74\">State of UP v. Dan Singh</a> (1997) 3 SCC 747).</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">13.   We are not in agreement with the High Court regarding the  absence  of\ncommon object of the A3, A4, A14, A15  and  A18.   The  evidence  on  record\nshows that the deceased and accused belong to two political parties  opposed\nto each other.  There were three other  incidents  of  clashes  between  the\nrival groups.  The existence of a CPI (M) office at Ottappilavu junction  is\nproved by a sketch of the site of the  incident.   The  accused  along  with\nothers assembled and were searching for BJP workers travelling in the  buses\nthat were passing through the junction.  We do not agree  with  the  finding\nof the High Court that merely because the accused did  not  plan  to  murder\nSuresh Babu (deceased), there was no common object.  The  common  object  of\nthe members of the unlawful assembly was to attack  any  BJP  supporter  who\nwas passing through Ottappilavu junction.  Unfortunately,  Suresh  Babu  was\nin the bus and he was killed in the attack.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1035123\" id=\"span_3\">14.

If unmerited acquittals become general, they tend to lead  to  a\ncynical disregard of the law, and this in turn leads to a public demand  for\nharsher legal  presumptions  against  indicted  “persons”  and  more  severe\npunishment of those who are found guilty. Thus, too frequent  acquittals  of\nthe guilty may lead  to  a  ferocious  penal  law,  eventually  eroding  the\njudicial protection of the guiltless. For all these reasons it  is  true  to\nsay, with Viscount Simon, that “a miscarriage of justice may arise from  the\nacquittal of the guilty no less than from the conviction of the  innocent.…”\nIn short, our jurisprudential enthusiasm  for  presumed  innocence  must  be\nmoderated by  the  pragmatic  need  to  make  criminal  justice  potent  and\nrealistic.”\n\nThe point that remains to be considered is whether A3, A4, A14, A15 and  A18\nare liable to be convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_77\">149</a> IPC.  Taking  into  account\nthe fact that the incident occurred in the year  1993,  that  they  attacked\nthe deceased with sticks causing simple injuries on non-vital  parts,  their\nconviction under <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_79\">149</a> IPC will meet the  ends  of  justice.

A. BOBDE, J.\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">      I am in complete agreement with my learned brother  Nageswara  Rao  J.\nI would, however, like to deal with  one  submission  made  at  the  bar  in\nrelation to the culpability of  an  accused  participating  in  an  unlawful\nassembly in general, and that of A4 Ummer alias Podi  Ummer  in  particular.\nIt has been argued on behalf of A4 that his mere presence  in  the  unlawful\nassembly could not be inculpatory since none of the witnesses attributed  an\novert act to the accused.  Such a submission without any  concrete  evidence\nenabling the Court to infer that the accused did  not  in  fact  harbor  the\nsame intention as that of the unlawful assembly, cannot be accepted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">      In the first place, the presence of an accused as part of an  unlawful\nassembly, when not as a  curious  onlooker  or  a  bystander,  suggests  his\nparticipation  in  the  object  of  the  assembly.   When  the   prosecution\nestablishes such presence, then it is the conduct of the accused that  would\ndetermine whether he continued to participate in the unlawful assembly  with\nthe intention to fulfill the object of the  assembly,  or  not.    It  could\nwell be that an accused had no intention to participate  in  the  object  of\nthe assembly.  For example, if the object  of  the  assembly  is  to  murder\nsomeone, it is possible that the accused  as  a  particular  member  of  the\nassembly had no knowledge of  the  intention  of  the  other  members  whose\nobject was to murder, unless of course the evidence to  the  contrary  shows\nsuch knowledge. But having participated and gone along with the  others,  an\ninference whether inculpatory or exculpatory can be drawn from  the  conduct\nof such an accused.  The  following  questions  arise  with  regard  to  the\nconduct of such an accused:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">What was the point  of  time  at  which  he  discovered  that  the  assembly\nintended to kill the victim?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">Having discovered that, did he make any attempt to stop  the  assembly  from\npursuing the object?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">If he did, and failed, did  he  dissociate  himself  from  the  assembly  by\ngetting away?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      The answer to these  questions  would  determine  whether  an  accused\nshared the common  object  in  the  assembly.   Without  evidence  that  the\naccused had no knowledge of the unlawful object of the assembly  or  without\nevidence that after having gained knowledge, he  attempted  to  prevent  the\nassembly from accomplishing the unlawful object, and without  evidence  that\nafter having failed to do so, the accused  disassociated  himself  from  the\nassembly, the mere participation of an accused in such an assembly would  be\ninculpatory.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      In the case of A4, there is no such evidence  on  record  that  having\nparticipated in the unlawful assembly which resulted in the death of  Suresh\nBabu, he made any attempt to either stop the incident from taking place,  or\nhaving found out that he could not prevent it, dissociated himself from  the\nassembly.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      Therefore, he must be held liable under <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_91\">149</a> of the  Indian\nPenal Code.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                                                  .....................………J.\n                                                              [ S.A.
