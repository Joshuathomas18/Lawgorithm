Yet\n                                             hopefully the identical position of\n                                             wiping out all delays at the Patna\n                                             Bench itself would be reached well\n                                             within    the     next    year.     However,\n                                             there is no gainsaying the fact that\n                                             as of today 1983 murder appeals\n                                             only     can    be    listed   (barring         the\n                                             specially ordered cases) and heard\n                                             in the ordinary course and there\n                                             thus remains a yawning gap of three\n                                             years or more betwixt the filing of\n                                             an appeal and its final disposal. So\n                                             long     as    this   remains       and    if    it\n                                             unfortunately recurs, the significant\n                                             issues raised herein have to be\n                                             considered and frontally faced.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">                             10. Upon analyzing the situation as it then\n\n             prevailed, the Full Bench made significant observations,\n\n             which, in our view, are of immense importance in the\n\n             present scenario, since the state of affairs as on today is\n\n             more alarming. The Full Bench observed that it would be a\n\n             sound practice that unless there are cogent grounds for\n\n             acting otherwise, on conviction, an appellant would become\n\n             entitled to the favourable consideration for his liberty and\n\n             grant of bail when even after 1 year of incarceration and\n\n             pendency of the appeal, the High Court is not able to bring\n\n             it to a final hearing. The Full Bench has observed that in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.583 of 2015 (7)                               8</span>\n\n\n\n\n             such cases, where hearings of appeals extend to 3 or 4\n\n             years, the persons, who are vicariously convicted on capital\n\n             charges with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/968081/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 34</a> or 149 of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_20\">IPC</a>, may\n\n             well be granted bail on the admission of the appeal itself\n\n             during the pendency of its hearing after such time. While\n\n             making these observations, the Full Bench made it clear\n\n             that the practice shall apply only to ordinary run of the mill\n\n             cases and not to the &quot;peculiar and exceptionally heinous\n\n             crimes&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">                             11. As can be noticed from Full Bench decision,\n\n             in case of Anurag Baitha (supra), relevant portion of which\n\n             has been quoted hereinabove, the Court held that cases of\n\n             convicts to whom primal role in a capital crime is attributed\n\n             and are held guilty on substantive charge of murder or\n\n             other capital offences, are undoubtedly on a different\n\n             footing and the said concession cannot be extended to them\n\n             routinely. The Full Bench, however, added that even they\n\n             should not be denied bail and allowed to continue in further\n\n             incarceration for 3 or 4 years, awaiting of appeal after\n\n             having already undergone the mill of a trial extending over\n\n             2 to 5 years. The Full Bench, thus, held that even in their\n\n             cases, after the period of 1 year of the pendency of the\n\n             appeal, the issue of suspension of sentence and release on\n\n             bail would have to be considered on the basic ground of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.583 of 2015 (7)                                     9</span>\n\n\n\n\n             delay in the light of the inability of the Court itself to hear\n\n             and disposed of the appeal. The Bench in most categorical\n\n             and unambiguous terms held that peculiarly heinous crimes\n\n             shocking the very conscience of the society and the Court\n\n             &quot;there will be no alternative but to extend the concession of\n\n             appeal, under this class of cases as well if the insistent\n\n             claim of the convicts for hearing of the appeal could not be\n\n             acceded to and their appeal are not adjudicated upon within\n\n             the reasonable time frame of one year.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">                             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"178983283\" id=\"span_19\">12. Similar question arose for consideration\n\n             before a Division Bench of this Court in case of Chandra\n\n             Shekhar         Bharti      (supra),   wherein   this   Court   dealt\n\n             elaborately the Full Bench decision of this Court, in case of\n\n             Anurag Baitha (supra), and the Supreme Court decision,\n\n             in case of <a href=\"/doc/178983283/\" id=\"a_21\">Kashmira Singh</a> (supra).</span> The Division Bench of\n\n             this Court, in case of Chandra Shekhar Bharti (supra),\n\n             noticed the ratio laid down by the Full Bench, in case of\n\n             Anurag Baitha (supra), rejecting the plea of the State that\n\n             delay in hearing of appeal cannot be a ground for release of\n\n             a prisoner. In case of Anurag Baitha (supra), the Full\n\n             Bench of this Court held that neither principle nor precedent\n\n             could be cited for any such constricted view rather even\n\n             under <a href=\"/doc/985477/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 389</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n\n             inordinate delay in hearing of substantive appeals, because\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\"> Patna High Court CR. APP (DB) No.583 of 2015 (7)                                    10</span>\n\n\n\n\n             of the Court&#x27;s own inability to do so, would be extremely\n\n             relevant factor for grant of bail inasmuch as <a href=\"/doc/985477/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 389</a> of\n\n             the Code of Criminal Procedure mentions necessity of\n\n             recording       of    reasons         for   suspending   sentence   and\n\n             undoubtedly it would be a good reason to state that there is\n\n             no practicable possibility of expeditious hearing of the\n\n             appeal. The Division Bench, in case of Chandra Shekhar\n\n             Bharti      (supra),       concluded,       in   paragraph   111,   that\n\n             notwithstanding the fact that prisoner&#x27;s application for\n\n             suspension of sentence and his consequent release on bail\n\n             cannot be allowed on merit or has been rejected on merit,\n\n             the Appellate Court still retains the power to suspend the\n\n             sentence for such period as the Court may consider\n\n             imperative, particularly, when the Court finds that such\n\n             suspension of sentence would make the right to life,\n\n             guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India,\n\n             meaningful. The Division Bench held (i) inordinate delay in\n\n             disposal of the appeal, (ii) terminal ailments, (iii) marriage\n\n             of daughter, and (iv) performing last rites, etc. as the\n\n             circumstances falling in the broader definition of right to life\n\n             and can become valid grounds for suspension of sentence of\n\n             a prisoner and his release on bail for a temporary period or\n\n             until disposal of his substantive appeal.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">                             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"178983283\" id=\"span_21\">13.

The Supreme Court in said case\n\n             posed a question to itself as to whether the practice should\n\n             be departed from and, if so, in what circumstance and\n\n             observed that no practice howsoever sanctified by usage\n\n             and hallowed by time can be allowed to prevail if it operates\n\n             to cause injustice.

The Supreme Court, in case of <a href=\"/doc/178983283/\" id=\"a_28\">Kashmira\n\n             Singh</a> (supra), further remarked that practice not to\n\n             release on bail a person, who was sentenced to life\n\n             imprisonment, was evolved in the High Courts on the basis\n\n             that once a person had been found guilty and sentenced to\n\n             life imprisonment, he should not be let loose, so long as his\n\n             conviction and sentence are not set aside, but at the same\n\n             time noticed the underlying postulate of this practice that\n\n             the appeal of such person would be disposed of within a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\"> Patna High Court CR.

The rationale\n                                             of     this   practice    can   have    no\n                                             application where the Court is not in\n                                             a position to dispose of the appeal\n                                             for five or six years. It would indeed\n                                             be a travesty of justice to keep a\n                                             person in jail for a period of five or\n                                             six years for an offence which is\n                                             ultimately found not to have been\n                                             committed by him.

It has been noticed by the Single Bench, in\n\n             the case of Ubed (supra), that criminal appeals (DB) of the\n\n             year 2010, where the appellants are in custody, are being\n\n             heard; whereas, criminal appeals (DB) are pending final\n\n             hearing from 1993. There may be exceptions where few\n\n             appeals of subsequent years might have been taken up for\n\n             final hearing and might have been disposed of on urgent\n\n             mentioning or for any other reason. This is, by and large,\n\n             the scenario of long pendency of criminal appeals in Patna\n\n             High Court. Apparently, thus, an appellant, in custody, has,\n\n             as on date, to wait for five years or more after filing of the\n\n             criminal appeal, to get his appeal heard. Many of them\n\n             might have spent some period in custody in course of\n\n             investigation or trial, prior to conviction and presentation of\n\n             appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">                             17.

In case of female convict, such\n\n             period shall be six years in place of seven years.

In the present case, the appeal was filed in\n\n             August, 2015. His prayer for suspension of sentence has\n\n             been rejected on merit by an order, dated 31.08.2015.
