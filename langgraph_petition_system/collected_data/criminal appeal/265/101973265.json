Lokur, J.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">   Leave granted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">2.     The question for  consideration  is  whether  Mr.  G.  Bhavani  Singh\nappointed as a Special Public Prosecutor in the trial of  the  case  against\nMs.  Jayalalithaa  and  other  accused  persons  in  the  Special  Court  in\nBengaluru was entitled to represent the prosecution in the appeals filed  in\nthe Karnataka High Court by the accused persons against their conviction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.     My answer to this question is in the negative on an  appreciation  of\nearlier directions given by this court, on a  reading  of  the  notification\nappointing Mr. Bhavani Singh as  a  Special  Public  Prosecutor  and  on  an\ninterpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 24</a>, <a href=\"/doc/90679/\" id=\"a_2\">25</a>, <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_3\">25-A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1402254/\" id=\"a_4\">301(1)</a> of the Code  of  Criminal\nProcedure, 1973. The result is that the hearing of the appeals in  the  High\nCourt stands vitiated, since the  prosecution  was  not  represented  by  an\nauthorized person.  The appeals will have to be heard  afresh  by  the  High\nCourt with the prosecution represented  by  a  Public  Prosecutor  appointed\nunder <a href=\"/doc/726894/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 24(1)</a> of the  Criminal  Procedure  Code,  1973  or  a  Special\nPublic Prosecutor appointed by the State of Karnataka  under  <a href=\"/doc/709330/\" id=\"a_6\">Section  24(8)</a>\nof the said Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">4.     Before adverting to the facts of the  case,  it  needs  mention  that\nthis case is a classic illustration of  what  is  wrong  with  our  criminal\njustice delivery system.  If the allegations made by  Mr.  K.  Anbazhagan[1]\nare true that  the  accused  persons  used  their  power  and  influence  to\nmanipulate and subvert the criminal justice system for more  than  15  years\nthereby delaying the conclusion of the trial against  them,  then  it  is  a\nreflection on the role  that  power  and  influence  can  play  in  criminal\njustice delivery.  However, if the allegations made by  him  are  not  true,\neven then it is extremely unfortunate that  a  criminal  trial  should  take\nmore  than  15  years  to  conclude.   Whichever  way  one  looks   at   the\nunacceptable delay, it is the criminal justice delivery  system  that  comes\nout the loser.  Something drastic needs to be done to remedy the system,  if\nnot completely overhaul it, and as this case  graphically  illustrates,  the\ntime starts NOW.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">Background facts\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"926636\" id=\"span_1\">5.     The background facts  relating  to  the  appeals  have  been  pithily\nstated in <a href=\"/doc/926636/\" id=\"a_7\">K. Anbazhagan v. Superintendent  of  Police</a>[2]  and  the  relevant\nfacts are paraphrased for the purposes of this decision.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">6.     From 1991 to 1996, Ms. J. Jayalalithaa was  the  duly  elected  Chief\nMinister of Tamil Nadu. A political party called the AIADMK  headed  by  her\nwas defeated in the general elections held in  1996  and  another  political\nparty, the DMK, was voted in with a majority. On the  basis  of  allegations\nof amassing assets  disproportionate  to  their  known  sources  of  income,\ncriminal  proceedings  were  initiated  against  Ms.  Jayalalithaa  and  her\nassociates. Special Courts were constituted by the new  government  for  the\ntrial of the cases filed against  Ms.  J.  Jayalalithaa,  Ms.  S.  Sasikala,\nMr.V.N. Sudhakaran and Ms. J. Elavarasi. The  constitution  of  the  Special\nCourts was upheld by this court.[3]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">7.     In 1997, CC No. 7 of 1997 was  filed  before  the  Principal  Special\nJudge, Chennai for the trial of Ms. J. Jayalalithaa, Ms.  S.  Sasikala,  Mr.\nV.N. Sudhakaran and Ms. J. Elavarasi, who were charge-sheeted  for  offences\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 120-B</a> of the  Indian  Penal  Code,  <a href=\"/doc/1169411/\" id=\"a_9\">Section  13(2)</a>  read  with\n<a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the Prevention  of  Corruption  Act,  1988  for  alleged\naccumulation of wealth of Rs 66.65 crores, disproportionate to  their  known\nsources of income.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">8.     The trial of CC No. 7 of 1997 progressed  before  the  Special  Judge\nand by August 2000, as many as 250 prosecution witnesses were  examined.  In\nthe  general  elections  held  in  May  2001,  the  AIADMK  headed  by   Ms.\nJayalalithaa secured a majority of votes in the elections  and  therefore  a\nmajority of seats in the Legislative Assembly. She was chosen as the  leader\nof the House by the AIADMK and appointed as  the  Chief  Minister  of  Tamil\nNadu. Her appointment as Chief Minister was challenged soon  thereafter  and\nthis court  declared  that  her  appointment  was  not  legal  or  valid.[4]\nConsequently, on 21st September, 2001 she  ceased  to  hold  the  office  of\nChief Minister of Tamil Nadu.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">9.     Sometime in January-February, 2002 the Election Commission  of  India\nannounced a bye-election to the Andipatti Constituency. In the  bye-election\nheld on 21st February, 2002 Ms. Jayalalithaa was declared  elected  and  she\nwas sworn in as the Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu on 2nd  March,  2002.  With\nthe  change  in  government,  it  appears  that  three  Public   Prosecutors\nconnected with CC No. 7 of 1997 resigned; a Senior  Advocate  appearing  for\nthe State also resigned as also the Investigating Officer. It  appears  that\ndue to these resignations, and perhaps for other reasons, the trial did  not\nproceed. Eventually, on 7th November, 2002 the trial in CC  No.  7  of  1997\nresumed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">10. On the resumption of the trial, as many as  76  PWs  were  recalled  for\ncross-examination on the ground that counsel appearing for  the  accused  or\nsome of them had earlier been busy in some other case  filed  against  them.\nIt seems that the Public Prosecutor did not object to  the  witnesses  being\nrecalled or gave his consent for their recall. Out of a  total  76  PWs,  as\nmany as 64 PWs resiled  from  their  previous  statement-in-chief.  It  also\nappears that the Public Prosecutor made no attempt to declare  them  hostile\nand/or to cross-examine them by resorting  to  <a href=\"/doc/1646837/\" id=\"a_11\">Section  154</a>  of  the  Indian\nEvidence Act. It also appears that no attempt  was  made  to  see  that  the\ncourt takes action against the witnesses for perjury. Furthermore, it  seems\nthat the  presence  of  Ms.  Jayalalithaa  was  dispensed  with  during  her\nexamination under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure  Code,  1973\n(for short &#x27;the Code&#x27;) and instead a questionnaire was sent to her  and  her\nreply to the questionnaire was sent to the court  in  absentia.  Apparently,\nthe Public Prosecutor did not object to Ms. Jayalalithaa&#x27;s  application  for\ndispensing with her presence at the time of examination  under  Section  313\nof the Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">11. In these circumstances, the appellant,  Mr.  Anbazhagan  moved  transfer\npetitions in this court under Section 406 of the Code  seeking  transfer  of\nCC No.7 of 1997 and CC No. 2 of 2001  pending  in  the  Court  of  the  XIth\nAdditional Sessions Judge (Special  Court  No.1),  Chennai  to  a  court  of\nequivalent competent jurisdiction in any other State.[5]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"926636\" id=\"span_2\">12. The transfer petitions were allowed by this court by  its  judgment  and\norder dated 18th November, 2003 and the decision of this court  is  reported\nas <a href=\"/doc/926636/\" id=\"a_13\">K. Anbazhagan v. Superintendent of Police</a>.[6]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">13. While it is not necessary to go into great detail into the  reasons  why\nthis court transferred the cases, it is nevertheless  necessary  to  mention\nthat this court observed that Mr.  Anbazhagan  had  made  out  a  case  that\nconfidence in the fairness of the trial was being  seriously  undermined  by\nthe manner in which the prosecution was being conducted.   It  was  observed\nthat the Public Prosecutor was  hand  in  glove  with  the  accused  thereby\ncreating a reasonable apprehension of likelihood of failure of  justice  and\nthere was a  strong  indication  that  the  process  of  justice  was  being\nsubverted.  Accordingly, this court transferred  the  prosecution  being  CC\nNo.7 of 1997 and CC No.  2  of  2001  pending  in  the  court  of  the  XIth\nAdditional Sessions Judge (Special Court No.1) Chennai from  Tamil  Nadu  to\nKarnataka with the  following  directions  given  in  paragraph  34  of  the\nReport:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">(a) The State of Karnataka in consultation with the  Chief  Justice  of  the\nHigh  Court  of  Karnataka  shall  constitute  a  Special  Court  under  the\n<a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_14\">Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988</a> to whom CC No. 7 of 1997 and CC  [pic]No.\n2 of 2001 pending  on  the  file  of  the  XIth  Additional  Sessions  Judge\n(Special Court No.1), Chennai  in  the  State  of  Tamil  Nadu  shall  stand\ntransferred.

The\nPublic Prosecutor will also be at liberty to apply that  action  in  perjury\nto be taken against some or all  such  witnesses.  Any  such  application(s)\nwill be undoubtedly considered on its merit(s).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">(g) The State of Tamil Nadu shall ensure that all documents and records  are\nforthwith transferred to the Special Court on its  constitution.  The  State\nof Tamil Nadu shall also ensure that the witnesses are produced  before  the\nSpecial Court whenever they are required to attend that court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">(h) In case any witness asks for protection, the State  of  Karnataka  shall\nprovide protection to that witness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">(i) The Special Judge shall after completion of  evidence  put  to  all  the\naccused all relevant evidence and documents appearing  against  them  whilst\nrecording  their  statement  under  Section  313.

The directions that are of primary concern are directions (a),  (b)  and\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">(c). They are to the effect that the State of Karnataka should constitute  a\nSpecial Court to try the transferred cases  in  Bangalore  (now  Bengaluru);\nthat a  Special  Judge  be  appointed  to  the  Special  Court  to  try  the\ntransferred cases on a day  to  day  basis;  that  the  State  of  Karnataka\nshould, in consultation with the Chief Justice of the Karnataka High  Court,\nappoint a senior lawyer having experience in criminal  trials  as  a  Public\nProsecutor to conduct the transferred cases against the accused persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">15.

During the pendency of W.P. No. 38075 of 2013, by a notification  issued\non 26th August, 2013 the appointment of Mr. Bhavani  Singh  as  the  Special\nPublic Prosecutor was withdrawn by  Karnataka.

No.145 of 2013.

The  State  of  Karnataka  then  consulted  the  Chief  Justice  of  the\nKarnataka High Court regarding the appointment of Mr. Bhavani Singh  as  the\nSpecial Public Prosecutor. On 14th September, 2013 the Chief Justice of  the\nKarnataka High Court concurred with the view of the State of Karnataka  that\nMr.  Bhavani  Singh  should  no  longer  continue  as  the  Special   Public\nProsecutor  before  the  Special  Court.   On   16th   September,   2013   a\nconsequential order was passed by Karnataka withdrawing the  appointment  of\nMr. Bhavani Singh as the Special Public Prosecutor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\">24. These developments led the accused persons to file  W.P.  (Crl.)  No.166\nof 2013 in this court challenging the orders dated 14th and 16th  September,\n2013.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7476014\" id=\"span_5\">25. Both the writ petitions, that is, W.P. (Crl.) Nos.154 and  166  of  2013\nwere heard together by this court and by a judgment  and  order  dated  30th\nSeptember, 2013 both the writ petitions were disposed of  and  it  was  held\nthat the order removing Mr. Bhavani Singh as the Special  Public  Prosecutor\nis mala fide and not sustainable in the eyes of the law and was  accordingly\nquashed. The decision of this court is reported as <a href=\"/doc/7476014/\" id=\"a_23\">J. Jayalalithaa v.  State\nof Karnataka</a>.[12]</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_37\">26. The trial thereafter continued before the  Special  Court,  though  with\nsome hiccups (major and minor), with which we are not directly concerned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">27. In any event, on  27th  September,  2014  the  Special  Court  delivered\njudgment convicting all the  accused  persons  including  Ms.  Jayalalithaa.\nAmong the materials considered by  the  Special  Court  were  the  elaborate\nwritten submissions given by Mr. Anbazhagan to the  Special  Court  on  19th\nMay, 2014.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">28. At this stage, it is necessary to make a  digression  for  understanding\nthe issues raised in these appeals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">29. The prosecution against Ms. Jayalalithaa and others was at the  instance\nof the State of Tamil Nadu but after  the  prosecution  was  transferred  to\nKarnataka,  and  in  terms  of  the  decision  of  this  Court  rendered  in\nAnbazhagan[13] particularly paragraph  34(c)  thereof,  Tamil  Nadu  had  no\nfurther say in matters relating to the  Public  Prosecutor  or  the  Special\nPublic Prosecutor (apart from the payment of his  fees  etc.).  It  was  for\nKarnataka to appoint the Public Prosecutor, who was to be  a  senior  lawyer\nhaving experience in criminal trials; the appointment  was  to  be  made  in\nconsultation with the Chief Justice of the  High  Court  of  Karnataka;  the\nPublic Prosecutor could be an appointee from  within  Karnataka  or  outside\nthe State; the Public Prosecutor was entitled to the assistance  of  another\nlawyer of his choice who could also be from Karnataka or outside the  State;\nall expenses and fees payable to the Public  Prosecutor  and  his  assisting\nlawyer were to be paid by Karnataka and that was to be reimbursed  by  Tamil\nNadu. It is under these circumstances that Karnataka virtually stepped  into\nthe shoes of the State of Tamil Nadu and thereby  became  directly  involved\nand concerned, at least in so far as the prosecution of the accused  persons\nis concerned in Special CC No. 208 of 2004.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">30. It is not that by issuing the directions contained  in  paragraph  34(c)\nabove, this court  adopted  a  procedure  that  was  without  precedent.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1886518\" id=\"span_6\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/1886518/\" id=\"a_24\">Jayendra Saraswati Swamigal v.

It is the prerogative of the  State  Government  to  appoint  a\nPublic Prosecutor to conduct the case  which  is  pending  in  the  sessions\ndivision of that State.&quot;[15]\n\nIt was further held:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">&quot;Of course, this  Court  while  passing  order  of  transfer,  can  give  an\nappropriate  direction  as  to  which  State  should  appoint   the   Public\nProsecutor to conduct that particular case. Such orders  are  passed  having\nregard to the circumstances of  the  case  and  the  grounds  on  which  the\ntransfer has  been  effected.  This  Court  can  certainly  give  directions\nirrespective of the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 24</a> CrPC. But so  far  as\nthis case is concerned,  nothing  had  been  stated  in  the  order  of  the\ntransfer.

I dare say that the facts of these  appeals  clearly  suggest  that  not\nonly should the trial be fair to the  accused  persons  but  also  that  the\ntrial should be fair to the prosecution also.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">34. It was then clarified by this court:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">&quot;However, we make it clear that the State  of  Pondicherry  [the  transferee\nState in this case] can appoint any  counsel  as  Public  Prosecutor  having\nrequisite qualifications as prescribed under sub-section (8) of  <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_29\">Section  24</a>\nCrPC whether he is a lawyer  in  the  State  of  Pondicherry  or  any  other\nState.&quot;[18]\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">35. Feeling aggrieved by the conviction handed down by  the  Special  Court,\nMs. Jayalalithaa and the other accused persons filed  Criminal  Appeal  Nos.\n835-838 of 2014 before the Karnataka High Court  on  29th  September,  2014.\nSince Karnataka was not made a party in the  criminal  appeals,  that  State\ndid not appoint any Public Prosecutor or any Special  Public  Prosecutor  to\ncontest the appeals, even though, as mentioned above, it  had  stepped  into\nthe shoes of Tamil Nadu, as it were.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_47\">36. On the other hand, Tamil Nadu acted  with  remarkable  alacrity  and  on\n29th September, 2014 the Principal Secretary  to  the  Government  of  Tamil\nNadu passed an order authorizing the  Directorate  of  Vigilance  and  Anti-\nCorruption, Chennai to engage the services of  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh,  Special\nPublic Prosecutor to appear before the High Court of Karnataka  for  and  on\nbehalf of the said  Directorate  in  any  appeal/bail  petition,  any  other\npetition that may arise out of the conviction of the accused  persons.

When the criminal appeals and the petitions for suspending the  sentence\nfiled by the accused persons came up  for  consideration  before  a  learned\nSingle Judge of the  Karnataka  High  Court  on  30th  September,  2014  Mr.\nBhavani Singh informed  the  court  that  he  was  appointed  by  the  State\nGovernment (Tamil Nadu) to represent the prosecution but  that  he  had  not\nreceived any official communication in this regard.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_50\">38. The appeals again came up before a learned Single Judge on 1st  October,\n2014 for the purposes of grant or refusal of suspension of sentence  of  all\nthe accused persons. On that date, Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  filed  his  Memo  of\nAppearance and a  statement  of  objections  opposing  the  release  of  the\naccused persons on bail.  Thereafter,  on  7th  October,  2014  the  learned\nSingle Judge, after hearing submissions of the parties, declined to  suspend\nthe sentence awarded to the accused persons or to grant them bail.[19]\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">39. Feeling aggrieved, the accused persons filed a petition  in  this  court\nchallenging the refusal of  bail  by  the  learned  Single  Judge.  In  that\npetition  being  SLP  (Crl.)  No.7900  of  2014  bail  was  granted  to  Ms.\nJayalalithaa and other accused persons by this court on 17th October,  2014.\nThe grant of bail was confirmed by this court on 18th December, 2014 and  it\nwas directed that the criminal appeals pending in the Karnataka  High  Court\nbe heard on a day to day basis so that they  could  be  disposed  of  within\nthree months.  The order passed by this court reads as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">                                    ORDER\n\nPursuant to the directions  issued  by  this  Court  dated  17.10.2014,  the\npetitioners have been released on bail.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">Petitioners have filed an affidavit dated 10.12.2014 to the effect that  the\nentire records of the trial court has been  filed  before  the  High  Court.\nFrom the affidavit, it is clear that necessary records have been  filed  and\nthe appeals are ripe for hearing.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">Keeping in view the peculiar facts of  the  case,  we  request  the  learned\nChief Justice of High Court of Karnataka to constitute a  Special  Bench  on\nthe date of  reopening  of  the  High  Court  for  hearing  of  the  appeals\nexclusively on day-to-day  basis  and  dispose  of  the  same  as  early  as\npossible at any rate within three months.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">Bail granted by us earlier is extended by another four months from today.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">    Call these special leave petitions on 17.04.2015.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_52\">40.

Earlier, Mr. Anbazhagan was of the view that Mr. Bhavani Singh  was  not\nentitled to represent the prosecution in the Karnataka High Court since  his\nappointment as  a  Special  Public  Prosecutor  stood  terminated  with  the\nconclusion of the trial and the delivery of judgment by the  Special  Court.\nMoreover, he had not been appointed by Karnataka in  consultation  with  the\nChief Justice of the High Court to represent the prosecution in the  appeals\npending in the High Court. Under these circumstances, Mr. Anbazhagan made  a\nrepresentation dated 24th December, 2014  to  the  Chief  Secretary  to  the\nGovernment of Karnataka to immediately appoint a  senior  lawyer  practicing\nin the Karnataka High Court as the Special Public Prosecutor to contest  the\nappeals filed  by  the  accused  persons.  However,  since  he  received  no\nresponse to his representation, he filed a writ petition  in  the  Karnataka\nHigh Court being Writ Petition No. 742 of 2015 seeking a  direction  to  the\nState of Karnataka to appoint any other senior lawyer as the Special  Public\nProsecutor in the pending criminal appeals being Criminal Appeal  Nos.  835-\n838 of 2014. The present appeals  arise  out  of  the  proceedings  in  Writ\nPetition No. 745 of 2015.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_54\">Decision in the writ petition\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">42. After hearing learned counsels  for  the  parties,  the  learned  Single\nJudge, by his judgment and order dated 19th January, 2015 disposed  of  W.P.\nNo. 742 of 2015.[20] It was held that the directions issued  by  this  court\nin Anbazhagan[21] were confined to the  procedure  to  be  followed  in  the\ntrial. It was noted that &quot;the very object of transferring  the  case  to  be\nprosecuted in the State of Karnataka by the State Government  of  Karnataka,\nby adopting the special procedure  prescribed,  was  on  the  Supreme  Court\nhaving lost confidence of a fair trial being conducted within the  State  of\nTamil Nadu  and  in  any  organ  of  the  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu  being\ninvolved.&quot; It was also noted that &quot;It is therefore  a  matter  of  formality\nfor the Supreme Court to  clarify  as  to  the  procedure  in  appointing  a\ncounsel  and  his  assistant,  if  any,  and  in  the  conduct  of   further\nproceedings.&quot; The writ petition was then  disposed  of  with  the  following\nobservations:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">&quot;To hazard a guess, the indication is  that  the  proceedings  in  entirety,\ntill the same attains finality, shall be taken to its logical conclusion  by\nthe State of Karnataka.  In  any  event,  since  this  court  would  not  be\ncompetent to  interpret  or  expound  on  what  is  not  spelt  out  in  the\ndirections issued by the Supreme Court, in so far as  the  procedure  to  be\nfollowed in the manner or terms of appointment of Prosecution Counsel,  post\nthe judgment of the trial court, in the appeals now  pending,  it  would  be\nappropriate if the proceedings are allowed to continue  notwithstanding  the\nchallenge as to the validity or otherwise of the appointment  of  respondent\nNo. 5 [Mr. Bhavani Singh], as there is no discernible  prejudice  caused  by\nhis continuance as the Special Public Prosecutor for the  time  being.  This\nis especially so, when  the  proceedings  are  directed  by  the  Honourable\nSupreme Court to be conducted on a day to day basis, before a Special  Bench\nand with expedition. Hence, to pronounce on the  validity  of  the  disputed\nappointment and to hamper the proceedings would be  counter  productive  and\nundesirable. It is open either for the State Government of Karnataka or  the\npetitioner himself, to seek further clarifications from  the  Supreme  Court\nas to the procedure that is to  be  followed  in  making  appointment  of  a\nSpecial Public Prosecutor  and  an  assistant  or  assistants,  if  any,  to\nrepresent the State of Karnataka.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">43. In this context, it is important to notice the stand taken by  Karnataka\nbefore the learned Single Judge. It was submitted by  the  learned  Advocate\nGeneral for Karnataka that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">&quot;The learned Advocate General would concur that  the  directions  issued  by\nthe Supreme Court do not specify as to the procedure that is to be  followed\nin the appointment of a Public Prosecutor before this court in  the  pending\nappeals. However, if the objective of the Supreme Court is to be  understood\nin its broadest sense, it would have to be taken that the  State  Government\nof Karnataka, is entrusted with the task  of  conducting  the  case  at  all\nstages, till it attains finality.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">The learned Advocate General would however, submit that after  the  judgment\nwas pronounced by the trial court, there has been  no  further  consultation\nbetween the State Government of Karnataka and the Chief Justice of the  High\nCourt of  Karnataka,  as  directed  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  making  any\nappointment of a Special Public  Prosecutor  and  there  is  no  appointment\norder issued in favour of respondent No. 5, afresh; he would further  submit\nthat if it is a formality to be complied  with,  the  State  Government,  in\nconsultation with the Chief Justice, shall take  further  steps.  Since  the\nState Government is not formally authorized to take any steps in so  far  as\nthe appointment of the prosecutor or counsel  to  conduct  the  appeals,  no\nsteps have been taken.&quot; (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_57\">44. Feeling aggrieved by the judgment and order dated 19th January,  2015  a\nwrit appeal was filed by Mr. Anbazhagan in the High Court being Writ  Appeal\nNo.260 of 2015. The State of Karnataka did not file any appeal  against  the\njudgment and order of the learned Single Judge but  accepted  it.  The  writ\nappeal filed by Mr. Anbazhagan was partly allowed by the Division  Bench  by\nits judgment and order dated 11th   February,  2015.[22]  This  decision  is\nunder challenge in this court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_58\">Decision in the writ appeal\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_59\">45. In the writ appeal, it was contended by Mr. Anbazhagan that  it  is  for\nthe transferee State (Karnataka) alone to prosecute the case in the  Special\nCourt and the appeals in the High Court. The transferor State  (Tamil  Nadu)\nhas no effective role to play in the prosecution of the appeals.  Since  Mr.\nBhavani Singh was not appointed by Karnataka to contest the appeals  in  the\nHigh Court, he was not entitled to appear on behalf of the  prosecution  and\nsince Tamil Nadu had no role to play in the prosecution of the appeals,  his\nappointment by Tamil Nadu was bad in law. It was further submitted that  the\nappointment of  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  as  a  Special  Public  Prosecutor  was\nconfined only to the trial before the Special  Court  and  that  appointment\ncame to an end  on  the  conviction  of  the  accused  persons.  Unless  his\nappointment as a Special Public Prosecutor was  notified  by  Karnataka  for\ncontesting the appeals in the High Court, Mr. Bhavani Singh could not  enter\nappearance for the prosecution. For this additional reason also Mr.  Bhavani\nSingh&#x27;s appearance in the High Court in the pending  appeals  filed  by  the\naccused persons was unauthorized.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">46. Karnataka appeared through its  Advocate  General  and  the  submissions\nmade are best expressed in the words of the  Karnataka  High  Court  in  the\njudgment under appeal:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">&quot;Sri Prof. Ravi Verma Kumar, learned Advocate  General,  appearing  for  the\nState of Karnataka submitted that in pursuance of the directions  issued  by\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in consultation with the  Hon&#x27;ble  Chief  Justice,\nthe State of Karnataka appointed a Senior Counsel as the Public  Prosecutor,\nwho conducted the trial. When the said Senior Counsel pleaded his  inability\nto continue to appear,  they  appointed  the  5th  respondent  [Mr.  Bhavani\nSingh] as the Public Prosecutor, who  conducted  the  proceedings.  Now  the\ntrial has ended in an  order  of  conviction.  Accused  have  preferred  the\nappeals  before  this  Court.  As  earlier,  the  appointment  was  made  in\npursuance of the direction  issued  by  the  Hon&#x27;ble  Supreme  Court,  their\nunderstanding is that the obligation to appoint was only during trial.  With\nthe trial coming to an end with the order  of  conviction,  that  obligation\nceases. As there is no fresh direction issued by the Hon&#x27;ble  Supreme  Court\nto appoint a  Special  Public  Prosecutor,  they  have  not  made  any  such\nappointment. Though the  State  has  appointed  a  Public  Prosecutor  under\n<a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 24(1)</a> of the Code, in the absence of any  direction  from  the  Apex\nCourt, the said Public Prosecutor is not appearing in  the  pending  appeals\nbefore the High Court.  As the matter is sub-judice,  they  have  not  taken\nany further action in this matter.&quot;[23] (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_61\">47. Learned counsel appearing on behalf of Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  relied  upon\nSection 301(1) of the Code which he interpreted to mean that no fresh  order\nor authorization was necessary to enable or entitle  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  to\nappear in the criminal appeals pending  in  the  High  Court.  It  was  also\nsubmitted that if Mr. Anbazhagan had any grievance with the order passed  on\n29th September, 2014 by the Principal Secretary to the Government  of  Tamil\nNadu authorizing the Directorate of Vigilance and  Anti-Corruption,  Chennai\nto engage the services of Mr.  Bhavani  Singh,  Special  Public  Prosecutor,\nthen he should have challenged it. Since he has not challenged  that  order,\nit continues to remain operative.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">48. The High Court discussed the case law on the subject of the role of  the\ntransferee State in a case such as the present and concluded:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">&quot;From the aforesaid judgments, the law is fairly clear. In pursuance of  the\npower conferred under Section 406 of the Code, if the Supreme Court were  to\ntransfer any particular case from one High Court to another  High  Court  or\nfrom a Criminal Court subordinate to one  High  Court  to  another  Criminal\nCourt of equal or superior jurisdiction subordinate to another  High  Court,\nthen the State from which the case is transferred  loses  control  over  the\nprosecution to be conducted in the transferee Court. It  is  the  transferee\nState which acquires jurisdiction to prosecute the said case. If  the  order\nof transfer passed by the Apex Court does not  specify  who  should  appoint\nthe Public  Prosecutor  to  conduct  a  particular  case,  then  it  is  the\ntransferee State which has to appoint  a  Public  Prosecutor  under  <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_31\">Section\n24</a> of the Code. If the order of transfer specifies who  should  appoint  the\nPublic Prosecutor, then appointment should be made in accordance  with  such\ndirection.&quot;[24]\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">49. The High Court then concluded that the order passed on  29th  September,\n2014 by the Principal Secretary to the Government of Tamil Nadu was non  est\nand was not required to be challenged. It was held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">&quot;Therefore, when a specific direction is issued by the  Apex  Court  at  the\ntime  of  transferring  the  case,  it  is  the  transferee  Court-State  of\nKarnataka which shall appoint the Public  Prosecutor.  The  State  of  Tamil\nNadu lost control over the case  transferred  to  the  State  of  Karnataka.\nTherefore, the State of Tamil Nadu has no jurisdiction to appoint  a  Public\nProsecutor in the Special Court nor in the  appeals  which  are  pending  in\nthis Court. Hence, the order passed by the State of Tamil  Nadu  authorizing\nthe deleted third respondent herein to engage  the  services  of  the  fifth\nrespondent is without authority and non est in the eye of  law.  That  order\ndoes not confer any right on the fifth respondent to  represent  either  the\nState of Karnataka or the State of Tamil Nadu in the pending appeals  before\nthis Court. In view of our  findings  recorded  above  that  the  transferor\nCourt has no power to appoint a Public Prosecutor under  <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_32\">Section  24</a> of  the\nCode in respect of a case pending in  the  transferee  Court,  the  argument\nthat the appellant has not challenged the said order of appointment  has  no\nmerit.&quot;[25]\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">50. With regard to the interpretation of Section  301(1)  of  the  Code  and\nwhether, by virtue of his appointment as the Special  Public  Prosecutor  in\nSpecial CC No. 208 of 2004 Mr. Bhavani Singh could appear on behalf  of  the\nprosecution in the pending appeals in the High Court, emphasis was  laid  on\nthe words &quot;any court&quot; appearing in Section 301(1) of the  Code  and  it  was\nheld:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">&quot;It is well settled that we must look at the Act as  a  whole  and  discover\nwhat each Section, each clause, each phrase  and  each  word  is  meant  and\ndesigned to say as to fit into the scheme of the entire Act. No  part  of  a\nstatute and no word of a statute can be  construed  in  isolation.  Statutes\nhave to be construed so that every word has a place  and  everything  is  in\nits place. The language employed is that Public Prosecutor in  charge  of  a\ncase may appear and plead before &quot;any Court&quot;, in which that  case  is  under\nenquiry, trial or appeal.  If  the  intention  of  the  legislature  was  to\nconfine his appearance only  to  the  Court  in  which  the  case  is  under\nenquiry, trial or appeal, they would have  used  the  word  &quot;the  Court&quot;  in\nplace of &quot;any Court&quot;. Therefore, the intention  is  clear  and  unambiguous.\nOnce the Special Public Prosecutor is appointed to a case,  and  is  put  in\ncharge of a  case,  then  he  may  appear  and  plead  without  any  written\nauthority before &quot;any Court&quot; in which that case, which is entrusted to  him,\nis under enquiry, trial or appeal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">If a Public Prosecutor is appointed under <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 24(1)</a> or (3)  and  <a href=\"/doc/1148711/\" id=\"a_34\">Section\n25</a> of the Code and placed in charge of  a  case,  then  by  virtue  of  such\nappointment and entrustment as a Public Prosecutor, he may appear  in  Court\nin which that case is under inquiry, trial or appeal. However,  when  he  is\nappointed under <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 24(8)</a> of the Code as Special  Public  Prosecutor  he\nis appointed for the purposes of any case or class of cases. Section  301 of\nthe Code makes it clear that, when he is in charge of a case, he may  appear\nin &quot;any Court&quot; in which  that  case  is  under  inquiry,  trial  or  appeal.\nTherefore, a harmonious reading of these provisions makes it  clear  that  a\nPublic Prosecutor appointed under <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 24</a>  or  under  <a href=\"/doc/1148711/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 25</a>  of  the\nCode, though his appearance is normally confined to the Court  to  which  he\nis appointed, Section 301 of the Code  authorizes  him  to  appear  in  &quot;any\nCourt&quot; in which that case is under inquiry, trial or appeal.&quot;[26]\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">51. Thereafter, on a discussion of the case law on the subject, it was  held\nthat the word &#x27;case&#x27; in the context in which it is  used  would  include  an\nappeal. Thereby, Mr. Bhavani Singh had the authority to not only  appear  in\nthe case before the Special Court but also in the appeal arising out of  it.\nIt was held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">&quot;The word &#x27;case&#x27; is not defined in the Code.  It  is  a  word  of  wide  and\ncomprehensive import. The  word  &#x27;case&#x27;  cannot  be  equated  to  the  words\n&#x27;trial&#x27;, &#x27;appeal&#x27; or &#x27;revision&#x27;. It clearly  covers  for  larger  area  than\nwould be covered  by-such  words  as  &#x27;appeal&#x27;,  &#x27;revision&#x27;  or  &#x27;trial&#x27;  or\n&#x27;offences&#x27;. When the word &#x27;case&#x27; is used with reference to a criminal  case,\nit   encompasses   the   various   stages   of   a   criminal   case   i.e.,\nInvestigation/inquiry, trial and appeal. A criminal case commences with  the\nfiling of an F.I.R. and registration of the case and comes to  an  end  when\nthe judgment is  delivered  discharging  or  acquitting  or  convicting  the\naccused, when that judgment attains finality. In other  words,  after  trial\nthe accused is acquitted or convicted, the trial comes to  an  end  and  not\nthe criminal case. Trial of a case is  only  one  step  in  the  life  of  a\ncriminal case. Criminal case encompasses  investigation/inquiry,  trial  and\nappeal. They are all different stages in a criminal case.  The  word  &#x27;case&#x27;\nhas no fixed or universal meaning. It must be construed with regard  to  the\nparticular context in which it is used and with regard  to  the  scheme  and\npurpose of the measure concerned. This word is quite often used in the  Code\nwith an intention to give a  wider  meaning.  That  is  the  reason  why  in\nSection 301 the legislature has consciously used the word, that  the  Public\nProsecutor &quot;in charge of a case&quot; may appear and plead before  any  Court  in\nwhich &quot;that case is under inquiry, trial or appeal&quot;. In other  words,  if  a\nPublic Prosecutor is appointed to conduct a case, he is entitled  to  appear\nand plead without any written authority before any Court in which that  case\nis under inquiry, trial or appeal. Therefore, the words &quot;any Court&quot; used  in\nthis Section enables the Public  Prosecutor  to  appear  in  all  Courts  of\nCriminal Jurisdiction and it is not confined to the Court  to  which  he  is\nappointed. The only condition to be satisfied is that he should  be  put  in\ncharge of the case after his appointment  as  a  Public  Prosecutor.  It  is\naltogether different, if by a rule, regulation, practice, when  once  he  is\nappointed as a Public Prosecutor to a Court, he may not  appear  in  another\nCourt. Therefore, the  Legislature  has  consciously  used  the  words  &quot;may\nappear and plead&quot;. It is left to his discretion.&quot;[27]\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">52. At this stage, it is important to note  that  neither  Ms.  Jayalalithaa\nnor any of the other accused persons nor any of  the  other  parties  before\nthe High Court have challenged the decision of the High Court to the  extent\nthat Tamil Nadu had no  authority  to  appoint  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  as  the\nSpecial Public Prosecutor in  the  criminal  appeals  pending  in  the  High\nCourt. The only challenge is the one made by Mr. Anbazhagan  to  the  effect\nthat Section 301(1) of the Code does not authorize or enable or entitle  Mr.\nBhavani Singh to continue as a Special Public  Prosecutor  in  the  criminal\nappeals pending in the High Court and that the appointment  of  Mr.  Bhavani\nSingh as a Special Public Prosecutor was limited only to  the  trial  before\nthe Special Court and it automatically terminated on the conviction  of  the\naccused persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">53. It is under these circumstances that this appeal is before this court.\nDiscussion\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">54. There is no dispute that when  this  court  transfers  a  criminal  case\nunder Section 406 of the Code, from one State  to  another,  the  transferee\nState has full control in  the  matter  of  prosecuting  the  case  and  the\ntransferor State has no say  in   that  regard.  Indeed,  there  can  be  no\ndispute about this in view  of  the  decision  of  this  court  in  Jayendra\nSaraswati Swamigal. But, what does this imply?\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_69\">55. In my opinion, on the transfer of a case by  this  court  under  Section\n406 of the Code, the transferee State not only steps into the shoes  of  the\ntransferor State but it effectively becomes the prosecuting  State.  It  can\nand does appoint a Public Prosecutor to prosecute  the  case  and  a  Public\nProsecutor who is answerable to the government of the transferee State  only\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_70\">- the Public Prosecutor appointed by one State is certainly  not  answerable\nto the government of another State.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">56. On an earlier occasion in another transferred case, the  Allahabad  High\nCourt held that an appeal against a conviction would not be maintainable  in\nthe High Court in the transferor State but would  be  maintainable  only  in\nthe High Court of the transferee State.[28]\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_72\">57. The Delhi High Court has gone a  step  further  and  has  held  that  an\nappeal for the enhancement of sentence of a convicted person could be  filed\nby the government  of  the  transferee  State  in  the  High  Court  of  the\ntransferee State and there is nothing to  preclude  the  government  of  the\ntransferee State from doing so.[29] In other  words,  the  transferee  State\ndoes not merely step into the  shoes  of  the  transferor  State  but  takes\ncontrol of the prosecution. I need not say anything  more  on  this  subject\nsince there is no dispute that the transferee State takes control  over  the\nprosecution from the transferor State. All that  I  have  explained  is  the\nbreadth of the take-over - the take-over being complete.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_73\">58. So far as the present case is concerned, this court  did  not  give  any\ndirection with regard to  the  appointment  of  a  Public  Prosecutor  or  a\nSpecial Public Prosecutor post the decision in CC  No.7  of  1997.  In  that\nsense, it could possibly be argued that there was  a  vacuum.  However,  the\nlaw is quite clear, namely, that  Karnataka  as  the  transferee  State  was\nentitled to file an appeal in the Karnataka  High  Court,  should  the  need\nhave arisen, including an appeal for enhancement of sentence and that on  an\nappeal being filed in the High Court by the accused  persons,  Karnataka  as\nthe transferee State continues  to  retain  its  entitlement  to  appoint  a\nPublic Prosecutor or a Special Public  Prosecutor  to  contest  the  appeal,\notherwise the purpose  of  transferring  the  case  out  of  Tamil  Nadu  to\nKarnataka would stand frustrated at the appellate  stage.  Really  speaking,\nthis court did not leave behind any vacuum. That  Karnataka  was  remiss  in\nfulfilling its obligation to appoint a  Public  Prosecutor  to  contest  the\nappeals filed in the High Court by the  accused  persons  or  chose  not  to\nfulfill it for whatever reason, is no ground for Tamil  Nadu  to  appoint  a\nSpecial Public Prosecutor to appear in the  appeals.   This  conclusion  was\narrived at by the High Court in the judgment under challenge and no one  has\ndisagreed with the view that Tamil Nadu could not appoint Mr. Bhavani  Singh\nas a Special Public Prosecutor to contest the appeals  in  the  High  Court.\nThere the matter rests.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">59. What is the effect of Mr. Bhavani Singh&#x27;s  appointment  as  the  Special\nPublic Prosecutor  to  conduct  Special  CC  No.208/2004  and  what  is  the\ninterplay of this appointment with Section 301(1) of the  Code?  The  answer\nto this lies in (a) The directions given by this  court  while  transferring\nthe case from Tamil Nadu to Karnataka; (b) The contents of the  notification\nappointing Mr. Bhavani Singh as the Special  Public  Prosecutor  to  conduct\nSpecial CC No.208/2004 in the case of the  accused  persons  pending  before\nthe Special Court; and (c) The scheme of <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 24</a> and  Section  301(1)  of\nthe Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">60. What is the scope and intent of  the  directions  given  by  this  court\nwhile  transferring  the  prosecution  from  Tamil  Nadu  to  Karnataka?  As\nmentioned earlier, while it is not necessary to advert, in great detail,  to\nthe reasons  for  the  transfer  of  the  prosecution  from  Tamil  Nadu  to\nKarnataka, the fact of the matter is that this court noted and  cited  &quot;only\na few instances to show how the prosecution appears to have  acted  hand  in\nglove with the accused&quot;; that Mr. Anbazhagan had made out a case  &quot;that  the\npublic confidence in the fairness of trial is being  seriously  undermined&quot;;\nand that &quot;great prejudice appears to have been  caused  to  the  prosecution\nwhich could culminate in grave miscarriage of justice.&quot; It  is  under  these\ncircumstances that this court transferred the prosecution  from  Tamil  Nadu\nto Karnataka and the directions given by this court have, therefore,  to  be\nunderstood in that light, namely, to prevent the prosecution of the  accused\npersons getting derailed for collateral reasons.  While  deciding  the  writ\npetition,  the  learned  Single  Judge  held  that  this  court  had   &quot;lost\nconfidence of a fair trial being conducted within the State of Tamil  Nadu&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">61. A plain reading of  the  directions  given  by  this  court  on  earlier\noccasion makes it quite clear that this court was concerned  only  with  the\ntrial of CC No.7 of 1997 (and CC No.2 of 2001 with which this court  is  not\nconcerned). To ensure that the trial is fair and is conducted in  accordance\nwith law, this court directed the State of Karnataka to  appoint  a  Special\nJudge to try the case and also that &quot;the  trial  before  the  Special  Judge\nshall commence as soon as possible and will then proceed  from  day  to  day\ntill completion&quot;.  To ensure that the  Public  Prosecutor  does  not  become\nhand in glove with the accused persons,  this  court  further  directed  the\nappointment of a Public Prosecutor in consultation with  the  Chief  Justice\nof the High  Court  of  Karnataka.   It  was  made  clear  that  the  Public\nProsecutor shall be a senior lawyer having experience in criminal trials  so\nthat he could conduct the trial in the Special Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">62. The first three directions given by this court in  paragraph  34  on  an\nearlier occasion make it quite clear that the  focus  and  concern  of  this\ncourt was limited only to the conduct of a fair  trial  and  nothing  beyond\nit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">63. This court did not have, and could not have had in mind the fairness  or\notherwise of the proceedings subsequent to  the  conclusion  of  the  trial.\nThere was no basis or material to assume that after the  conclusion  of  the\ntrial, on an appeal filed by the prosecution or the accused persons (as  the\ncase may be), even the appellate proceedings in the  High  Court  would  get\nsubverted or compromised in any manner whatsoever. It would be sacrilege  if\nthis court were to assume without any basis that the  Karnataka  High  Court\ncould get compromised. Consequently, the  directions  given  by  this  court\nmust be  understood  as  limited  to  the  conduct  of  the  trial  and  the\nappointment of the Special Public Prosecutor was also limited  thereby.   In\nother words, the appointment of Mr. Bhavani  Singh  as  the  Special  Public\nProsecutor came to an end on the conclusion of the trial before the  Special\nCourt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_79\">64. This is not to say that Karnataka could  not  have  appointed  the  same\nSpecial Public Prosecutor (Mr. Bhavani Singh in this case)  as  the  Special\nPublic Prosecutor to conduct the appeals  that  might  be  filed  after  the\nconclusion of the trial. Karnataka  could  certainly  have  done  so  either\nthrough a composite notification for the trial and possible appeal(s) or  by\nseparate notifications. That Karnataka chose to appoint  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh\nas the Special Pubic Prosecutor for the trial only is  understandable.  That\nKarnataka chose to sit by and not  take  any  steps  to  appoint  anyone  to\ncontest the appeals filed by the accused persons is nothing but  a  shirking\nof its duty and responsibility - but that is  not  the  issue.  All  that  I\nintend to hold and do hold is that the directions given by this  court  were\nlimited only to the trial of the case before the Special Court in  Bengaluru\nand even Karnataka understood the directions to be limited to the trial  and\nacted only to that limited extent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">65. Does the notification appointing Mr. Bhavani Singh as a  Special  Public\nProsecutor  reflect  the  views  of  this  court?  The   contents   of   the\nnotification dated 2nd February, 2013 appointing  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  as  a\nSpecial Public Prosecutor are also of considerable importance,  although  it\nhas been submitted by learned counsel  for  the  accused  persons  that  the\nnotification may be ignored in view of the provisions of Section  301(1)  of\nthe Code. I do not think that the contents of the  appointment  notification\ncan be simply ignored or overlooked, as suggested  by  learned  counsel  for\nthe accused persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">66. The notification was issued pursuant to the  directions  given  by  this\ncourt transferring the prosecution from Tamil Nadu to  Karnataka  under  the\ncircumstances already mentioned.  The intention of this  court  was  clearly\nto ensure  that  upon  transfer  of  the  prosecution  from  Tamil  Nadu  to\nKarnataka, the prosecution does not, inter alia, become hand in  glove  with\nthe accused, that public confidence in the fairness  of  the  trial  is  not\nseriously undermined and that the prosecution does not culminate in a  grave\nmiscarriage of justice.  This court was, therefore, concerned only with  the\nproceedings before the Special Court and not subsequent proceedings  in  the\nHigh Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">67. This court was certainly conscious  of  the  procedure  required  to  be\nfollowed in the event of an appeal being filed in  the  High  Court  by  the\naccused persons or by  the  prosecution  and  obviously  did  not  think  it\nnecessary to advert to the procedure required to be followed.  The  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_39\">Code  of\nCriminal Procedure</a> adequately provides for it. It would not,  therefore,  be\ncorrect to say that the directions given by this court created a  vacuum  in\nthe event of an appeal to the High Court by the accused persons  or  by  the\nprosecution. This is more particularly so since there was nothing on  record\nto even remotely suggest that the proceedings in the High Court were  likely\nto get undermined in any manner. It is in this light that  the  notification\nappointing Mr. Bhavani Singh as a Special Public Prosecutor has to  be  read\nand understood and if the notification is so  read  and  understood,  it  is\nquite clear that Mr. Bhavani Singh was  given  authority  to  represent  the\nprosecution only before the Special Court and not in  the  High  Court.  The\nnotification appointing Mr. Bhavani Singh as  a  Special  Public  Prosecutor\nonly for the trial (and not for subsequent proceedings) correctly  reflected\nthe intent of this court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">68. The language employed in  the  notification  dated  2nd  February,  2013\nappointing Mr. Bhavani  Singh  as  a  Special  Public  Prosecutor  is  quite\nspecific and is to enable him &quot;to conduct Special C.C. No.208/2004  (in  the\ncase of Kum.  Jayalalitha  and  others)  pending  on  the  file  of  XXXVIth\nAdditional City Civil &amp; Sessions Court (Special Court),  Bangalore&quot;.   There\nis no mention about anything beyond Special  CC  No.  208/2004  such  as  an\nappeal filed in the High Court either by  the  accused  persons  or  by  the\nprosecution.   It  is  not  possible  to  read  into  the  language  of  the\nnotification any authority being given  to  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  to  proceed\nbeyond the trial in representing the prosecution.  It would be  violence  to\nthe language of the notification if it were given  an  interpretation  wider\nthan what the plain language suggests, intends and states.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">69. Can it  be  said,  under  these  circumstances,  that  the  notification\nappointing Mr. Bhavani Singh as a Special Public Prosecutor  could  be  read\nin conjunction with Section 301(1) of the Code as authorizing him to  appear\nin the High  Court  in  the  appeals  filed  by  the  accused  persons?  For\nanswering this, it is necessary to appreciate the scheme of <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_40\">Section  24</a>  and\nSection 301(1) of the Code. It is necessary to  look  at  a  few  provisions\nfirst.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">70. <a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 2(u)</a> of the Code defines &quot;Public Prosecutor&quot;.[30]  In  terms  of\nthe definition any person appointed under  <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_42\">Section  24</a>  of  the  Code  is  a\nPublic Prosecutor. A  Special  Public  Prosecutor  appointed  under  <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_43\">Section\n24(8)</a> of the Code is naturally also a Public Prosecutor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">71. <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 24</a> of the Code is a part of Chapter II  thereof  which  concerns\nthe constitution of criminal courts and offices.   Three  Sections  in  this\nchapter relate to Public Prosecutors, namely, Section  24,  Section  25  and\nSection 25-A.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_87\">72. <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 24(1)</a> of the Code provides  for  the  appointment  of  a  Public\nProsecutor for a High Court. The authority to appoint  a  Public  Prosecutor\nfor a High Court is vested both  in  the  Central  Government  and  a  State\nGovernment. The two requirements for the appointment of a Public  Prosecutor\nfor the High Court are that it shall be made  after  consultation  with  the\nHigh Court and the person so appointed shall, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_46\">Section  24(7)</a>  of\nthe Code, have been in practice as an  advocate  for  not  less  than  seven\nyears. The &#x27;jurisdiction&#x27; or &#x27;area of  operation&#x27;  of  a  Public  Prosecutor\nappointed for the High Court is limited to the High  Court  and  it  is  not\npossible for a Public Prosecutor appointed for the High Court to claim  that\nhe or she is entitled to appear in the District Court or any other court  by\nvirtue of his or her appointment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">73. A similar  power  of  appointment  of  a  Public  Prosecutor  for  every\ndistrict is given to the State Government by  <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_47\">Section  24(3)</a>  of  the  Code.\nThere is a similar limitation of &#x27;jurisdiction&#x27; or &#x27;area of operation&#x27; of  a\nPublic Prosecutor appointed under <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 24(3)</a> of the Code to the  district\nfor which he or she is appointed.   A  Public  Prosecutor  appointed  for  a\nparticular district cannot claim any authorization to  appear  as  a  Public\nProsecutor in any other district or in the High Court of the State in  which\nthat district is located.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">74. In other words, <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 24(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 24(3)</a> of the  Code  limit  the\n&#x27;jurisdiction&#x27; or the &#x27;area of operation&#x27; or the authority or the  orbit  of\nthe Public Prosecutor to the High Court [<a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 24(1)</a> of the Code]  or  the\ndistrict [<a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 24(3)</a> of the Code].\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">75. The first question that requires to be  asked  is  whether  Mr.  Bhavani\nSingh was appointed as a Public Prosecutor or a  Special  Public  Prosecutor\nfor the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 24(1)</a> of the Code.  The answer to  this  is\nin the negative. That being so, Mr. Bhavani Singh has no  authority  to  per\nse conduct the appeals in the High  Court  on  behalf  of  the  prosecution.\nReally speaking, that should conclude the debate.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_91\">76. The next question is whether Mr. Bhavani Singh can claim that  authority\nfor by relying on Section 301(1) read with <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 24(8)</a> of the  Code.   The\nanswer to this is also in the negative.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">77. In addition to the general power  or  authority  given  to  the  Central\nGovernment and the State Government to appoint a Public Prosecutor  for  the\nHigh Court [<a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 24(1)</a> of the  Code]  and  to  the  State  Government  to\nappoint a Public Prosecutor for a district [<a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 24(3)</a>  of  the  Code]  a\nmuch  wider  power  is  given  to  the  Central  Government  and  the  State\nGovernment by <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_57\">Section  24(8)</a>  of  the  Code  to  appoint  a  Special  Public\nProsecutor, being a person who has been a practicing advocate for  not  less\nthan ten years. The appointment of a Special Public Prosecutor is  not  with\nreference to the High Court or a district, but is an appointment for a  case\nin any court or a class of cases in any court or courts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_93\">78. <a href=\"/doc/1148711/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 25</a> of the Code provides for the appointment of Assistant  Public\nProsecutors.[31] <a href=\"/doc/361280/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 25(1)</a> of the Code enables the State  Government  to\nappoint one or more Assistant Public Prosecutors in every  district  of  the\nState to conduct prosecutions in the  courts  of  the  Magistrates.  <a href=\"/doc/1148711/\" id=\"a_60\">Section\n25(1A)</a> of the Code enables the Central Government to  appoint  one  or  more\nAssistant Public Prosecutors to conduct any case or class of  cases  in  the\ncourts of the Magistrates. For the present purposes, <a href=\"/doc/1148711/\" id=\"a_61\">Section  25(3)</a>  of  the\nCode is also of importance.

Section 25-A of the Code is also of  importance  for  understanding  the\n&#x27;jurisdictional&#x27; limitations placed on a  Public  Prosecutor  or  a  Special\nPublic Prosecutor.[32] However, this Section does not  concern  itself  with\nAssistant Public Prosecutors.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_95\">80. Section 25-A(5) of the Code provides that  a  Public  Prosecutor  and  a\nSpecial Public Prosecutor appointed by the State  Government  under  <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_62\">Section\n24(8)</a> of the Code to conduct cases in the High Court  shall  be  subordinate\nto the Director of Prosecution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">81. Section 25-A(6) of the Code provides that  a  Public  Prosecutor  and  a\nSpecial Public Prosecutor appointed by the State  Government  under  <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_63\">Section\n24(8)</a> of the Code to conduct cases in District Courts (as  in  the  case  of\nMr.  Bhavani  Singh)  shall  be  subordinate  to  the  Deputy  Director   of\nProsecution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_97\">82. In this background, Section  301(1)  of  the  Code  is  required  to  be\nconsidered and appreciated. This provision applies  not  only  to  a  Public\nProsecutor as defined in <a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 2(u)</a> of the Code [which includes a  Special\nPublic Prosecutor] but it also applies to an  Assistant  Public  Prosecutor.\nThis is of some importance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_98\">83. Section 301(1) of the Code has three ingredients for its  applicability:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">(1) The Public Prosecutor or the Assistant  Public  Prosecutor  must  be  in\ncharge of the case; (2) If the Public Prosecutor  or  the  Assistant  Public\nProsecutor is in charge of a case, he or  she  is  entitled  to  appear  and\nplead without any written  authority;  (3)  The  Public  Prosecutor  or  the\nAssistant Public Prosecutor in charge of a case is entitled  to  appear  and\nplead without any written authority before any court in which that  case  is\nunder enquiry, trial or appeal.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">84. Learned counsel for the  accused  persons  read  this  to  mean  that  a\nSpecial Public Prosecutor [Mr. Bhavani Singh] in charge of  a  case  in  the\nDistrict Courts [the case of the accused persons in the  Special  Court]  is\nentitled to appear and plead (without any written authority)  in  any  court\n[the High Court] since that &#x27;case&#x27; is in appeal in the High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">85. If the argument of learned counsel for the accused persons is  accepted,\nit could lead to  an  anomalous  result  and  an  anomalous  situation.  One\nanomalous result is that a Public Prosecutor  in  charge  of  a  case  in  a\ndistrict or an Assistant Public Prosecutor in charge of a case in the  court\nof a Magistrate can claim, on the basis of Section 301(1) of  the  Code,  to\nappear and plead without any written authority before  any  court  in  which\nthat case is under appeal, including the High Court of the State.   Since  a\npolice officer can also be appointed  as  an  Assistant  Public  Prosecutor,\nacceptance of the argument would mean that a police  officer  (appointed  as\nan Assistant Public Prosecutor) can appear and  plead  without  any  written\nauthority in the High Court of  the  State  in  which  that  case  is  under\nappeal! By no stretch of imagination can  this  be  the  intent  of  Section\n301(1) of the Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_101\">86. An anomalous situation  can  also  arise  if  the  argument  of  learned\ncounsel for the accused persons is accepted. One such situation could  arise\nin the following circumstances: In an appeal in the High Court  arising  out\nof a case in a district,  the  Public  Prosecutor  for  the  High  Court  is\nengaged. However, the Public Prosecutor  in  charge  of  that  case  in  the\ndistrict or an Assistant Public Prosecutor (including a police  officer)  in\ncharge of that case in the court of a Magistrate appears in the  High  Court\nin the appeal relying, for this purpose, upon Section 301(1)  of  the  Code.\nThen, in the appeal, the  said  Public  Prosecutor  or  the  said  Assistant\nPublic Prosecutor could take a stand that is diametrically opposed to or  in\nconflict with the stand of the Public Prosecutor before the High  Court.  Is\nSection 301(1) of the  Code  liable  or  susceptible  to  such  an  unlikely\ninterpretation as is canvassed by learned counsel for the  accused  persons?\nI do not think so.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">87. That such an eventuality is not theoretical is clear from the  facts  of\nthis case itself. As  mentioned  above,  the  accused  persons  applied  for\nsuspension of their sentence. Written objections  were  filed  opposing  the\nsuspension of the sentence. However, when the  application  was  heard,  the\nSpecial Public Prosecutor (Mr. Bhavani Singh) did not oppose the  suspension\nof the sentence. The learned Single Judge hearing the  application  recorded\nin his order rejecting the application as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">&quot;When the Special Public Prosecutor was asked  as  to  whether  he  has  any\nsubmission in this regard to make, he has openly submitted that  he  has  no\narguments to make and that the sentence may be  suspended  and  the  accused\nmay be released on imposing conditions deemed fit  under  the  circumstances\nof the case. But he did not make any submission as to whether  he  does  not\npress the written objections already filed.&quot;[33]\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_103\">88. Had the State of Karnataka appointed a Public Prosecutor  for  the  High\nCourt to contest the appeals filed by  the  accused  persons,  it  is  quite\npossible that the said Public Prosecutor would have  supported  the  written\nobjections and opposed the suspension of sentence.   In  that  event,  there\nwould have been a rather piquant  situation  (if  not  a  spectacle)  -  the\nSpecial Public Prosecutor (Mr. Bhavani Singh) supporting suspension  of  the\nsentence of the accused persons and  the  Public  Prosecutor  for  the  High\nCourt opposing suspension of the sentence of  the  accused  persons  on  the\nbasis of the written objections.  Surely, Section 301(1) of the Code is  not\nrequired to be interpreted in a manner so as to cause confusion.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_104\">89. The only reasonable interpretation that can be given to the scheme  laid\nout in <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_65\">Sections 24</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1148711/\" id=\"a_66\">25</a>, 25-A and  301(1)  of  the  Code  is  that  a  Public\nProsecutor appointed for the High Court and  who  is  put  in  charge  of  a\nparticular case in the High Court, can appear and plead <a href=\"/doc/1886518/\" id=\"a_67\">in  that  case</a>  only\nin the High Court without any written authority whether that case is at  the\nstage of  inquiry  or  trial  or  appeal.  Similarly,  a  Public  Prosecutor\nappointed for a district and who is put in charge of a  particular  case  in\nthat district, can appear and plead  <a href=\"/doc/1886518/\" id=\"a_68\">in  that  case</a>  only  in  the  district\nwithout any written authority whether that case is at the stage  of  inquiry\nor trial or appeal. So also, an Assistant Public Prosecutor who  is  put  in\ncharge of a particular case in the court of a  Magistrate,  can  appear  and\nplead <a href=\"/doc/1886518/\" id=\"a_69\">in that case</a> only in the court of a  Magistrate  without  any  written\nauthority whether that case is at the stage of inquiry or trial  or  appeal.\nEqually, a Special Public Prosecutor who is put in charge  of  a  particular\ncase can appear and plead <a href=\"/doc/1886518/\" id=\"a_70\">in that case</a> only in the  court  in  which  it  is\npending without any written authority whether that case is at the  stage  of\ninquiry or trial or appeal. In other  words,  Section  301(1)  of  the  Code\nenforces the &#x27;jurisdictional&#x27; or &#x27;operational&#x27; limit and enables the  Public\nProsecutor and Assistant Public  Prosecutor  to  appear  and  plead  without\nwritten authority only within that &#x27;jurisdictional&#x27; or &#x27;operational&#x27;  limit,\nprovided the Public Prosecutor or the  Assistant  Public  Prosecutor  is  in\ncharge of that case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_105\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1886518\" id=\"span_7\">90.  The  converse  is  not  true,  and  a  Prosecutor  (Public  Prosecutor,\nAssistant Public Prosecutor or Special Public  Prosecutor)  who  is  put  in\ncharge of a particular case cannot appear and plead  <a href=\"/doc/1886518/\" id=\"a_71\">in  that  case</a>  without\nany written authority outside his or her &#x27;jurisdiction&#x27; whether  it  is  the\nHigh Court or the district or the court of a  Magistrate.  In  other  words,\nSection 301(1) of the Code maintains a  case  specific  character  and  read\nalong with <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_72\">Sections 24</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1148711/\" id=\"a_73\">25</a> and  25-A  of  the  Code  maintains  a  court  or\ndistrict specific character as well.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1493500\" id=\"span_8\">91. The decision rendered by the Constitution Bench in <a href=\"/doc/1493500/\" id=\"a_74\">State  of  Punjab  v.\nSurjit Singh</a>[34] is not quite apposite.  [Though that decision was  rendered\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_75\">Code of Criminal  Procedure</a>,  1898  the  relevant  sections  under\nConstitution are more or less similar to those sections  of  the  Code  that\nthis court is concerned with].  In Surjit Singh the  issue  that  arose  was\nnoted in the following words:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">&quot;The question that arises for consideration  in  this  criminal  appeal,  by\nspecial leave, is regarding the right of a  Public  Prosecutor  to  file  an\napplication,  under  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_76\">Section  494</a>  of  the  Code   of   Criminal   Procedure\n(hereinafter called the Code),  in  respect  of  a  complaint,  filed  by  a\nprivate party, and which was being prosecuted by him as such&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">92. In the context of the question that  arose  for  consideration,  it  was\nheld that a Public Prosecutor not in charge of a  particular  case  and  not\nconducting the prosecution will not be entitled to  ask  for  withdrawal  of\nthe prosecution under Section 494 of the old Code.  On facts,  it  was  held\nthat the prosecuting Deputy Superintendent of  Police  was  nowhere  in  the\npicture in the private complaint  when  he  filed  an  application  for  its\nwithdrawal under Section 494 of the old Code. In that view  of  the  matter,\nit was held that the High Court was right in  its  conclusion  that  such  a\nPublic Prosecutor is not entitled to file  an  application  for  withdrawal.\nIt will be seen  that  this  decision  has  nothing  to  do  with  a  Public\nProsecutor in charge of the case at the stage of  trial  being  entitled  to\nappear in an appeal filed against an order of conviction in the trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">93. The Constitution Bench referred to what would be an anomalous result  if\na Public Prosecutor who had nothing  to  do  with  the  particular  case  is\nentitled to file an application  for withdrawal under  Section  494  of  the\nold Code.  By way of illustration, the  Constitution  Bench  noted  that  if\nthere are two Public Prosecutors appointed for a particular  court  and  one\nof them is conducting the prosecution in a particular case  and  desires  to\ngo on with the proceedings, it will be open to the other  Public  Prosecutor\nto  ask  for  withdrawal  from   the   prosecution.    Similarly,   it   was\nillustratively observed that  a  Public  Prosecutor  appointed  for  case  A\nbefore a particular court, can, by virtue of his being a  Public  Prosecutor\nfile an application in case B, with which he has nothing to do, and ask  for\npermission of the court to withdraw  from  the  prosecution.   Extrapolating\nthis illustration to the  facts  of  the  present  case,  the  result  would\ncertainly be anomalous if a Public Prosecutor appointed for case A before  a\nparticular Court (read Mr. Bhavani Singh appointed for the case against  the\naccused persons before the Special Court) can by virtue of  being  a  Public\nProsecutor appear in case B with which  he  has  nothing  to  do  (read  the\ncriminal appeals filed in the Karnataka High Court).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_109\">94. It is in this context that the Constitution Bench held that Section  494\nof the old  Code  refers  only  to  a  Public  Prosecutor  in  charge  of  a\nparticular case and is actually conducting  the  prosecution  who  can  take\nsteps in the matter.  Under the circumstances, though Mr. Bhavani Singh  was\nentitled to conduct the trial before the Special  Court  in  an  appropriate\nmanner, merely because he was  in  charge  of  the  prosecution  before  the\nSpecial Court did not entitle  him  to  continue  with  the  &#x27;case&#x27;  in  the\ncriminal appeals filed in the High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">95. The High Court has,  in  the  judgment  and  order  under  appeal,  laid\nemphasis on the words &#x27;any Court&#x27; appearing in Section 301(1)  of  the  Code\nand understood them to mean that a Special Public Prosecutor in charge of  a\ncase at the stage of enquiry or trial, can appear and plead that  case  when\nan appeal  is  filed  in  respect  of  that  case.  In  view  of  the  above\ndiscussion, I am unable to agree with the  overbroad  opinion  expressed  by\nthe High Court. The words &#x27;any Court&#x27; have no reference to the hierarchy  of\ncourts.  The crucial word in Section 301(1) of the Code is  &#x27;case&#x27;  and  not\n&#x27;any Court&#x27;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_111\">96. Consequently, Mr. Bhavani Singh  having  been  appointed  as  a  Special\nPublic Prosecutor for a specific case  pertaining  to  the  accused  persons\nbefore the Special Court was  answerable  in  all  respects  to  the  Deputy\nDirector of Prosecution in terms of Section 25-A(6)  of  the  Code  and  his\nauthorization was limited only  to  that  case  before  the  Special  Court.\nTherefore, this precluded him from appearing on behalf  of  the  prosecution\nin the appeals filed by the accused persons in the High Court. He  needed  a\nspecific authorization in  that  regard  which  would  have  then  made  him\nsubordinate  to  the  Director  of  Prosecution  and   not   continued   his\nsubordination to the Deputy Director of Prosecution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_112\">97. This interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_77\">Sections 24</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1148711/\" id=\"a_78\">25</a>, 25-A  and  301(1)  of  the  Code\nalso appears to have been the  view  of  Karnataka,  appearing  through  its\nAdvocate General, that Mr. Bhavani Singh was engaged  only  to  conduct  the\ntrial before the Special Court and that  engagement  did  not  automatically\nimply any authorization to him to appear for the prosecution in the  appeals\npending in the High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">98. The Advocate General of  Karnataka  had  submitted  before  the  learned\nSingle Judge of the Karnataka High Court that  no  fresh  appointment  order\nwas issued in favour of  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  in  respect  of  the  criminal\nappeals filed by the accused persons, meaning thereby that for enabling  Mr.\nBhavani Singh to appear in those appeals,  a  fresh  appointment  order  was\nnecessary. This was in the context that after the conviction of the  accused\npersons,  there  had  been  no  further  consultations  between  the   State\nGovernment of Karnataka and the Chief Justice of the  Karnataka  High  Court\nin making any appointment of a Special Public Prosecutor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_114\">99. Before the Division Bench, the submission of the  Advocate  General  was\nmore explicit. It was submitted that the appointment of the  Special  Public\nProsecutor was made pursuant to  the  directions  of  this  court  and  that\n&quot;their understanding is that the  obligation  to  appoint  was  only  during\ntrial. With the trial coming to an end with the order  of  conviction,  that\nobligation ceases&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">100.   Right or wrong,  the  view  expressed  by  the  Advocate  General  of\nKarnataka could not have been ignored by the High Court.  It  is  altogether\nanother matter that the proper course of action  for  Karnataka  would  have\nbeen to either make a  specific  appointment  of  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  as  a\nSpecial Public Prosecutor to conduct the appeals pending in the  High  Court\nor to appoint the Public Prosecutor or another Special Public Prosecutor  or\nto obtain a clarification from this court, if necessary with regard  to  the\nappeals in the High Court. That Karnataka did  neither  and  entertained  an\nunnecessary doubt is unfortunate.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">101.   It may be recorded here that in this court, learned counsel  for  the\nState of Karnataka specifically stated the appointment of Mr. Bhavani  Singh\nas a Special Public Prosecutor came  to  an  end  with  the  conviction  and\nsentence of the accused persons.  In the written submissions  filed  by  the\nState of Karnataka, it is categorically stated as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">&quot;It is submitted that order dated 02.02.2013  appointing  Bhavani  Singh  is\nconfined to the Special CC No.208/2004.  It is submitted that Bhavani  Singh\nis relying on the G.O. dated 29.09.2014 issued by State  of  Tamil  Nadu  to\nconduct the case as SPP  before  the  Hon&#x27;ble  High  Court  in  Crl.  Appeal\nNo.835/2014 and the  Division  Bench  quashed  this  order  as  one  without\njurisdiction&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">102.   This written submission is a clincher and the debate should end  with\nthis categorical assertion by the State of Karnataka.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_118\">103.   But, to be fair to Karnataka, it is  not  a  party  to  the  criminal\nappeals and that may perhaps be the reason for its inaction - if action  had\nbeen taken, it could be misconstrued as interfering in a case  in  which  it\nhad no concern. That this &#x27;reason&#x27; is unjustified has already been  adverted\nto. But then, it was equally the duty and responsibility of  Tamil  Nadu  to\neither take the opinion of Karnataka on the future  course  of  action  with\nregard to representation in the criminal appeals  or  to  have  brought  the\n&#x27;vacuum&#x27; to the notice of the learned Judge  hearing  the  criminal  appeals\nrather than rushing in with the  ill-advised  order  dated  29th  September,\n2014. That Tamil Nadu sought to take advantage of  a  situation  that  ought\nnot to have even existed is  also  unfortunate.  However,  to  give  it  the\nbenefit of doubt, it is possible that Tamil Nadu was  also  in  a  state  of\nconfusion.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_119\">104.   It seems that Tamil Nadu may also have been of the view  (though  not\nso expressed) that the appointment of Mr. Bhavani Singh as a Special  Public\nProsecutor had come to an end and that  is  the  reason  why  the  Principal\nSecretary to the Government of Tamil  Nadu  authorized  the  Directorate  of\nVigilance and Anti Corruption,  Chennai  to  engage  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  to\nappear in the High Court by issuing the order dated  29th  September,  2014.\nIf at law Mr. Bhavani Singh was automatically authorized to  appear  in  the\nappeals pending in the High Court by virtue of Section 301(1) of  the  Code,\nthere was no  occasion  for  Tamil  Nadu  to  issue  the  order  dated  29th\nSeptember, 2014 and Mr. Bhavani Singh  could  have,  on  the  basis  of  the\nearlier authorization given to  him  on  2nd  February,  2013  by  Karnataka\nentered appearance in the High Court on behalf of the prosecution. That  the\nHigh  Court  held  the  order  dated  29th  September,  2014   was   without\njurisdiction is of no consequence - what is important is  the  understanding\nof Tamil Nadu of the position at law namely, that  the  appointment  of  Mr.\nBhavani Singh as a Special  Public  Prosecutor  came  to  an  end  with  the\nconviction and sentence of the accused persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\">105.   Learned counsel for  the  accused  persons  submits  that  a  Special\nPublic Prosecutor can be appointed in a case or for a  class  of  cases  and\nthe word &#x27;case&#x27; includes an appeal. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1438425\" id=\"span_9\">In this context reliance was  placed  on\n<a href=\"/doc/1438425/\" id=\"a_79\">Mansoor v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>[35] wherein it was held that &#x27;case&#x27;  must\nmean a proceeding which  at  the  end  results  whether  in  the  discharge,\nconviction or acquittal of an accused person. The context in  which  Mansoor\nwas decided was completely different. In that case  a  gazette  notification\nwas issued  appointing  the  Additional  Government  Advocate  as  a  Public\nProsecutor for the High Court in respect of cases arising in  the  State  of\nMadhya Pradesh. The Additional Government  Advocate  cum  Public  Prosecutor\nfiled an appeal in the High Court against  an  order  of  acquittal  by  the\ntrial  court.  The  argument  raised  was  that  the  Additional  Government\nAdvocate cum Public Prosecutor could not be considered a  Public  Prosecutor\nfor presenting an appeal against an acquittal in the High Court  because  an\nappeal against an acquittal could not be described as a  case  which  arises\nin the High Court. This court observed that &quot;The argument has merely  to  be\nstated to be rejected.&quot; Nevertheless, this court went on to hold  that  &quot;The\ncase resulting in the acquittal of the accused persons would  clearly  be  a\ncase arising in the State and within the contemplation of  the  notification\nand the Additional Government Advocate who is a Public  Prosecutor  for  the\nHigh Court would be entitled to present the appeal in such a  case&quot;.  It  is\nin this context that it was held that an appeal is a case. I am afraid  this\nhas no relevance, one way or another, to  the  controversy  in  this  court,\nnamely, the authority of Mr. Bhavani Singh to appear in  the  appeals  filed\nin the High Court by the accused persons.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">106.   The word &#x27;case&#x27; occurring in <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 24</a> and  Section  301(1)  of  the\nCode is required to be given its ordinary and natural  meaning  and  in  the\ncontext in which it is used. It cannot be given an extended  meaning  so  as\nto  include  an  appeal.  Otherwise,  as  pointed  out  above,  in  a  given\nsituation, an Assistant Public Prosecutor in  charge  of  a  case  before  a\nMagistrate can argue for the displacement of a Public  Prosecutor  appointed\nfor the High Court by the State Government after consultation with the  High\nCourt. How strange is that.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_122\">107.   Learned counsel also sought to rely on Rule 30 of the  Karnataka  Law\nOfficers  (Appointment  and  Conditions  of  Service)  Rules,   1977   which\nauthorizes the Government of Karnataka to appoint an advocate as  a  Special\nCounsel for the conduct of a criminal  case  or  any  appeal  or  proceeding\nconnected therewith pending in a court whether within the State  or  in  any\nother State or in the Supreme Court or in any High  Court  in  the  country.\nLearned counsels submits that since the appointment of Mr. Bhavani Singh  is\nalso in terms of Rule 30 of the aforesaid Rules, he is  entitled  to  appear\nin the High Court in the appeals filed by the accused persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">108.   I am unable to accept this submission for the simple reason  that  it\nhas not been anybody&#x27;s case at any stage that Mr. Bhavani Singh appeared  in\nthe High Court in the appeals filed by the accused persons in  his  capacity\nas  a  Special  Counsel  and  not  in  his  capacity  as  a  Special  Public\nProsecutor. This submission is being made for the first  time  and  only  in\nthis court. That apart,  the  facts  relating  to  the  appointment  of  Mr.\nBhavani Singh as a Special Counsel  are  not  available  on  record.  It  is\nunclear whether the Chief Justice of the Karnataka High Court was  consulted\nonly about the  appointment  of  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  as  a  Special  Public\nProsecutor or whether he was consulted about the appointment of Mr.  Bhavani\nSingh as a Special Counsel as well. Unless  the  facts  are  clear  in  this\nregard it is difficult to come to any  conclusion  on  this  submission.  If\nreliance by learned counsel for the accused persons is  now  solely  on  the\nappointment of Mr. Bhavani Singh as a Special  Counsel,  then  relying  upon\nhis appointment as such would fly in the face of  the  directions  given  by\nthis court for the appointment of a Public Prosecutor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_124\">109.   In any event, Rule 30  of  the  aforesaid  Rules  enables  the  State\nGovernment to appoint an advocate  as  a  Special  Counsel  either  for  the\nconduct of a civil case or a criminal case  or  any  appeal  or  proceedings\nconnected therewith. The provision enabling the  appointment  of  a  Special\nCounsel is obviously disjunctive. Rule 30 of the said Rules must be read  as\nit is and the appointment of  a  Special  Counsel  would  have  to  be  made\nseparately for a civil case or for a criminal case or for any appeal or  for\nany proceedings connected with a civil  case  or  a  criminal  case  or  any\nappeal. There is nothing to show that Mr. Bhavani Singh was appointed  as  a\nSpecial Counsel by the State of Karnataka  for  the  appeals  filed  by  the\naccused persons in the High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_125\">110.   I am  not  discussing  the  differences  in  the  role  of  a  Public\nProsecutor and the role of a Special Counsel since it is  not  necessary  to\ndo so. All that need be said is that their  respective  roles  are  distinct\nand separate as indeed  their  responsibilities  with  a  Public  Prosecutor\nhaving great responsibilities (as  submitted  by  learned  counsel  for  the\naccused persons), much more than a Special Counsel.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_126\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1877200\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"309271\" id=\"span_11\">111.   Learned counsel for the accused persons submit that  due  to  certain\ndevelopments having taken place, namely, that the  hearing  in  the  appeals\nhas been concluded and judgment reserved, the de facto doctrine would  apply\nto the facts of the present case since Mr. Bhavani Singh had  in  fact  been\nappointed as the Special Public Prosecutor to contest the appeals  filed  by\nthe accused persons in the  High  Court.  Reference  was  made  to  <a href=\"/doc/309271/\" id=\"a_81\">Gokaraju\nRangaraju v. State  of  Andhra  Prades</a>[36]  wherein  <a href=\"/doc/1877200/\" id=\"a_82\">Pulin  Behari  v.  King\nEmperor</a>[37] was referred which held that &quot;acts  of  the  officers  de  facto\nperformed by them within the scope of their assumed or  official  authority,\nin the interest of the public  or  third  persons  and  not  for  their  own\nbenefit, are generally as valid and binding, as if they  were  the  acts  of\nofficers de jure.&quot;</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\">112.   I have serious reservations on this submission in the  context  of  a\nlawyer representing a litigant. No  lawyer  either  in  his  capacity  as  a\nprivate lawyer or a lawyer for the State  or  as  a  Public  Prosecutor  can\npurport to  represent  a  litigant  without  any  authority  for  doing  so.\nAcceptance of such a proposition and then relying on the de  facto  doctrine\ncould lead to chaos in the dispensation of justice. If Mr. Bhavani Singh  is\nnot authorized to represent  the  prosecution  in  the  High  Court  in  the\nappeals filed by the accused persons, he simply cannot do so and if he  does\nso, the accused persons cannot put forward a fait accompli or rely upon  the\nde facto doctrine and say: So be it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">113.   That apart, assuming Gokaraju Rangaraju is  also  applicable  to  the\nengagement or appointment of a lawyer by his or her client, this  court  has\nnoted another rule, in the nature of an exception to the de facto  doctrine,\nwhich is that while a collateral  attack  to  the  appointment  of  a  judge\ncannot be made, a direct attack can  certainly  be  made.  It  was  held  in\nGokaraju Rangaraju:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">&quot;A judge, de facto, therefore, is one who is not a mere intruder or  usurper\nbut one who holds office, under  colour  of  lawful  authority,  though  his\nappointment is defective and may later be found to  be  defective.  Whatever\nbe the defect of his title to the office, judgments pronounced  by  him  and\nacts done by him when he was clothed with the powers and  functions  of  the\noffice, albeit unlawfully, have the same efficacy  as  judgments  pronounced\nand acts done by a judge de jure. Such is the de  facto  doctrine,  born  of\nnecessity and public  policy  to  prevent  needless  confusion  and  endless\nmischief. There is yet  another  rule  also  based  on  public  policy.  The\ndefective appointment of a de facto judge may be questioned  directly  in  a\nproceeding to which he  be  a  party  but  it  cannot  be  permitted  to  be\nquestioned in a litigation  between  two  private  litigants,  a  litigation\nwhich is of no concern or consequence to the judge except as  a  judge.  Two\nlitigants litigating their private titles cannot be permitted  to  bring  in\nissue and litigate upon the title of a judge to  his  office.  Otherwise  so\nsoon as a judge pronounces a judgment a litigation may be  commenced  for  a\ndeclaration that the judgment is void because  the  judge  is  no  judge.  A\njudged title to his office cannot be brought into jeopardy in that  fashion.\nHence  the  Rule  against  collateral  attack  on   validity   of   judicial\nappointments. To question a judges appointment  in  an  appeal  against  his\njudgment is, of course, such a collateral attack.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">114.   In so far as the present case is concerned, a direct attack has  been\nmade to the claimed validity of the continuation of Mr. Bhavani Singh  as  a\nSpecial Public Prosecutor in the High Court.  This  case,  therefore,  comes\nwithin the &#x27;another rule&#x27; or the exception to the de  facto  doctrine.  That\nthe objection to Mr. Bhavani  Singh&#x27;s  appearance  in  the  High  Court  was\nraised by Mr. Anbazhagan only on 24th December,  2014  and  not  earlier  is\nneither here nor there. It is not as if the objection was raised  belatedly.\nIn any event, the objection was raised before the  hearing  of  the  appeals\ncommenced and that is good enough.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_130\">115.   The submission that Mr. Bhavani Singh has impeccable credentials  and\nthe attempt of Mr. Anbazhagan is to somehow or the other get rid of  him  as\nthe Special Public Prosecutor is not relevant since his  competence  is  not\nin question. It is true that this court  in  Jayalalithaa[38]  had  observed\nthat  &quot;no  issue  has  been  raised  by  the  respondents   [including   Mr.\nAnbazhagan] in respect of the eligibility,  suitability  or  credibility  of\nRespondent 4 [Mr. Bhavani Singh] as an SPP.&quot; This court  had  also  observed\nthat the  attempt  to  remove  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  as  the  Special  Public\nProsecutor &quot;is a product  of  mala  fides&quot;.[39]  Furthermore,  even  in  the\njudgment under appeal it has been noted  that  &quot;Before  the  learned  Single\nJudge,  as  the  appellant  submitted  that,  he  would  not  go  into   the\nallegations made  against  the  5th  respondent  [Mr.  Bhavani  Singh],  but\nconfine his submissions to  the  legal  issues.&quot;  Learned  counsel  for  the\naccused persons submits that in the light of this, the desire of Tamil  Nadu\nto have the prosecuting agency effectively represented  in  the  appeals  in\nthe High Court through an eligible, suitable  and  credible  Special  Public\nProsecutor,  in  the   face   of   Karnataka   abdicating   its   duty   and\nresponsibility, cannot be faulted or misconstrued as is sought  to  be  done\nby Mr. Anbazhagan. He further submits that the appointment  of  Mr.  Bhavani\nSingh as the Special Public Prosecutor to contest the appeals  in  the  High\nCourt was really an act of necessity due to the  default  of  the  State  of\nKarnataka. All this may be so, but  as  mentioned  above,  this  is  not  in\ncontroversy in this court and I make no comment  on  it.  However,  I  would\nlike to make it explicit that I have referred  to  the  credentials  of  Mr.\nBhavani Singh only because  a  submission  was  made  in  that  regard.  Mr.\nBhavani Singh has not been issued notice  in  these  appeals  and  therefore\nnothing that I have said can be or  should  be  construed  as  doubting  the\ncredentials of Mr. Bhavani Singh.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_131\">116.   Learned counsel submits that Mr. Anbazhagan has been shifting  stands\nfrom time to time as per his convenience. At the present  moment,  his  view\nis that Mr. Bhavani Singh was  not  authorized  to  appear  as  the  Special\nPublic Prosecutor in the appeals filed by the accused persons  in  the  High\nCourt.  On an earlier occasion (and this fact has not been disclosed by  Mr.\nAnbazhagan in the list of dates supplied by him) his contention was that  it\nis only the Special Public Prosecutor who can appear in the  High  Court  in\nproceedings arising out of CC No.7 of 1997.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\">117.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"926636\" id=\"span_12\">In <a href=\"/doc/926636/\" id=\"a_83\">K. Anbazhagan v. The  Superintendent  of  Police</a>[40]  one  of  the\npoints  for  consideration  was  whether  the  Special   Public   Prosecutor\nappointed pursuant to the directions of this court  could  be  by-passed  by\nthe Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption,  Chennai  and  whether  it\nwas permissible to have  another  Public  Prosecutor  appear  for  the  said\nDirectorate  in  the  Karnataka  High  Court  ignoring  the  Special  Public\nProsecutor. It was held by the High Court that the Directorate of  Vigilance\nand Anti-Corruption, Chennai could not be permitted  representation  in  the\nHigh Court by a counsel of its own and that it would have to be  represented\nby the Special Public Prosecutor. Notwithstanding this decision  (which  has\nnot been disclosed by Mr. Anbazhagan to this  court)  an  objection  is  now\nbeing raised in the present case to the Special Public Prosecutor  appearing\nfor the Directorate of Vigilance and Anti-Corruption,  Chennai.  This  flip-\nflop by Mr. Anbazhagan reveals that he is not serious in his submissions.  I\nam mentioning this submission only to reject it. The issue  is  not  whether\nMr. Bhavani Singh can or cannot appear for the Directorate of Vigilance  and\nAnti-Corruption, Chennai - the issue is whether he can at all appear in  the\nHigh Court as a Special Public Prosecutor without being authorized to do  so\nin the appeals filed by the accused persons. In my opinion, he  cannot,  for\nmore than one reason, as indicated above.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_133\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"926636\" id=\"span_13\">118.   Finally, learned counsel submits that Mr. B.V. Acharya  had  appeared\non several occasions in the High Court in matters arising out  of  the  case\npending before the Special Judge when he was the Special  Public  Prosecutor\nto conduct that case. Therefore, there  is  nothing  wrong  in  Mr.  Bhavani\nSingh appearing in the High Court in the same manner as Mr. Acharya  did.  I\ndo not know the circumstances in which  Mr.  Acharya  appeared  and  in  any\nevent his appearance in the High Court is not in issue. It is not  necessary\nto comment on this at all. For the record, it  may  be  mentioned  that  the\nonly example cited by learned counsel for the accused persons relates to  <a href=\"/doc/926636/\" id=\"a_84\">K.\nAnbazhagan v. The  Superintendent  of  Police</a>[41]  but  <a href=\"/doc/926636/\" id=\"a_85\">in  that  case</a>,  the\nSpecial Public Prosecutor was shown as the second respondent  and  therefore\nMr. Acharya was entitled to appear <a href=\"/doc/926636/\" id=\"a_86\">in that case</a> being a respondent therein.\nConclusion</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\">119.   For the  reasons  given,  I  hold  that  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  is  not\nauthorized to represent the prosecution in the Karnataka High Court  in  the\nappeals filed by  the  accused  persons  against  their  conviction  by  the\nSpecial Court. That being so, the final hearing proceedings in  this  regard\nbefore the High Court are vitiated and the  appeals  filed  by  the  accused\npersons being Criminal Appeals Nos. 835-838 of 2014 will have  to  be  heard\nafresh by the High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_135\">120.   The State of Karnataka should now  ensure  that  the  prosecution  is\nduly represented by an authorized Public Prosecutor appointed under  <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_87\">Section\n24(1)</a> of the Code.  However, if the State of Karnataka decides to appoint  a\nSpecial Public Prosecutor under <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 24(8)</a> of the Code,  it  must  do  so\nonly in consultation with the Chief Justice of the Karnataka High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\">121.   In line with the view expressed by the  Delhi  High  Court,  which  I\nendorse, it is further directed that the State of Karnataka be made a  party\nrespondent in the appeals filed by the accused persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_137\">122.   The earlier directions given by this court regarding payment of  fees\nand assistance of another lawyer etc. will be incorporated in the  terms  of\nappointment of the Public Prosecutor or the  Special  Public  Prosecutor  as\nthe case may be.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_138\">123.   Criminal Appeal arising out of  S.L.P.  (Crl.)  No.1632  of  2015  is\nallowed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_139\">124.   Criminal Appeal No.638 of 2015 arises out of SLP  (Crl.)  No.2013  of\n2015. The challenge is to the decision of a  learned  Single  Judge  of  the\nKarnataka High Court dated 5th February, 2015 whereby I.A. No.1 filed  under\nSection 301(2) of the Code in Criminal  Appeal  Nos.  835-838  of  2014  was\ndismissed by the High Court.   In  that  I.A.,  Mr.  Anbazhagan  had  sought\npermission of the learned Single Judge to intervene in the  pending  appeals\nfiled by the accused persons and assist the Special Public Prosecutor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_140\">125.    The  prayer  in  this  court  is  for  permission  to  file  written\nsubmissions in the pending appeals filed by the  accused  persons.  However,\nthere is no such prayer in the application for permission  to  file  written\nsubmissions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_141\">126.   In the order under  appeal,  the  learned  Single  Judge  framed  the\nissues arising out of the application as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">Whether  the  applicant/intervener  can  be  permitted  to  intervene  as  a\nparty/respondent in the above appeals?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">Whether the intervener  can  be  permitted  to  assist  the  Special  Public\nProsecutor before this Court?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_142\">127.    In  my  opinion,  there  is  no  question  of  permitting        Mr.\nAnbazhagan to file written submissions. Section 301(2) of the Code does  not\npostulate the filing of any  written  submissions.   That  apart,  I  cannot\npermit Mr. Anbazhagan to file written submissions in the High Court when  no\nsuch prayer was made by him before the High Court. Even  if  such  a  prayer\nhad been made by Mr. Anbazhagan before the High Court, it was  entirely  for\nthe learned Single Judge to take a view in the matter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\">128.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"679033\" id=\"span_14\">In <a href=\"/doc/679033/\" id=\"a_89\">Haradhan Sen v.

Before the learned Single Judge  of  the  Karnataka  High  Court,  on\nbehalf of the appellant, it was submitted that the appellant  would  not  go\ninto the allegations made against Mr. Bhavani Singh, but would  confine  his\nsubmissions only to the legal issues and the said submission is referred  to\nin paragraph (13) of the impugned judgment.  Before  us,  even  though  much\narguments were advanced on the credibility of fifth respondent as a  Special\nPublic Prosecutor (SPP), in the High Court, since the matter was  restricted\nonly on the legal issues, I consciously refrain from  making  any  reference\nto the submissions touching upon the credibility of Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  and\nwould therefore confine my discussion only on the legal issues.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_150\">4.

Shorn of details of  chequered  history  of  the  case,  brief  facts\ngiving rise to these appeals are as follows:-  A  prosecution  was  launched\nagainst the  respondents under <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 13(1)(e)</a>  read  with   <a href=\"/doc/1259316/\" id=\"a_91\">Section  13(2)</a>\nof the Prevention of Corruption Act for possessing  assets  disproportionate\nto their known sources of income in the  year  1996-1997  in  the  State  of\nTamil Nadu.

The then Acting Chief  Justice\nof the Karnataka High Court on  29.01.2013  recommended  the   name  of  Mr.\nBhavani Singh-respondent No.5 for appointment as Special Public  Prosecutor,\nthough his name was not  submitted  by  the  Government  of  Karnataka.

Challenging the verdict of  conviction  and\nsentence of imprisonment  imposed,  accused  preferred  appeals  before  the\nKarnataka High Court in Criminal Appeal Nos. 835-838 of  2014.   During  the\npendency  of  the  appeals  in  the  High  Court,   the  accused  filed   an\napplication for enlarging them on bail and the learned Single  Judge  by  an\norder  dated  7.10.2014  dismissed  the  application  for  grant  of   bail.\nAggrieved by the said order, accused preferred appeal before this  Court  by\nfiling Special  Leave  Petition  (Crl.)  No.7900/2014.  By  an  order  dated\n17.10.2014, this Court enlarged all the accused on bail.   Thereafter,  this\nCourt passed  an  order  on  18.12.2014  requesting  the  Chief  Justice  of\nKarnataka High Court to constitute  a  Special  Bench  for  hearing  of  the\nappeals and further directed that the criminal appeals be heard  on  day-to-\nday basis and dispose of the same as early as  possible,  at  any  rate  not\nlater than three months.  After Christmas vacation, High Court of  Karnataka\nreopened on 2.01.2015 and hearing of the arguments in the  criminal  appeals\nstarted on 6.01.2015  and  hearing  was  concluded  on  11.03.2015.

After the Supreme Court has passed the Order  dated  18.12.2014,  the\nappellant who is the General Secretary of DMK Party  made  a  representation\non 24.12.2014 to the Government of Karnataka  requesting  it  to  appoint  a\nsuitable senior lawyer to appear for the Director  of  Vigilance  and  Anti-\nCorruption (for short &#x27;D.V &amp; A.C&#x27;), Tamil Nadu  before  the  High  Court  of\nKarnataka at Bangalore in the Criminal Appeal      Nos.  835-838/2014.   The\nappellant also filed  a  memo  on  7.01.2015  in  Criminal  Appeal  Nos.835-\n838/2014 contending that the  fifth  respondent  is  not  a  Special  Public\nProsecutor appointed by the Karnataka Government in  consultation  with  the\nChief Justice of High Court of Karnataka to  appear  in  the  appeals    and\ntherefore fifth respondent cannot appear in the appeals pending on the  file\nof the High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\">11.

Learned  Single  Judge  further  held  that  since  fifth\nrespondent was appointed  pursuant to the direction of  the  Supreme  Court,\nit is  therefore a matter of  formality for the Supreme Court to clarify  as\nto the procedure in  appointing  a counsel and his assistant,  if  any,  and\nin the conduct of further  proceedings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_167\">12.

On 11.02.2015, the High Court of Karnataka  passed  the  impugned\norder rejecting the appellant&#x27;s challenge  against  the  fifth  respondent&#x27;s\nauthority as Special Public Prosecutor to appear  in  the  appeals.   By  an\norder dated 5.02.2015 passed in I.A.

Of course, this Court while passing order  of  transfer,  can  give  an\nappropriate  direction  as  to  which  State  should  appoint   the   Public\nProsecutor to conduct that particular case. Such orders  are  passed  having\nregard to the circumstances of  the  case  and  the  grounds  on  which  the\ntransfer has  been  effected.  This  Court  can  certainly  give  directions\nirrespective of the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 24</a> CrPC. But so  far  as\nthis case is concerned,  nothing  had  been  stated  in  the  order  of  the\ntransfer. The provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 24</a> CrPC shall prevail  and  it\nis for the appropriate State Government  within  whose  area  the  trial  is\nconducted to appoint Public Prosecutor under  sub-sections  (3)  to  (7)  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 24</a> CrPC.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">15. The purpose of transfer of the criminal case from one State  to  another\nis to ensure fair trial to the accused. In this case,  the  main  ground  on\nwhich the transfer of the sessions case was ordered from the Sessions  Court\nof Chinglepet in Tamil Nadu to the Principal District  and  Sessions  Judge,\nPondicherry, was that the action of the prosecution  agency  had  created  a\nreasonable apprehension in the mind of the appellant-accused that  he  would\nnot get justice if the trial was held in the State of Tamil Nadu.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">17. As is evident from various provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_107\">CrPC</a>, the State  Government  of\nTamil Nadu can only appoint a Public  Prosecutor  or  an  Additional  Public\nProsecutor or a Special Public Prosecutor under <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 24</a> CrPC  to  conduct\nthe prosecution and appeal, or other proceeding in any  criminal  courts  in\nrespect of any case pending before the courts of Tamil Nadu and  in  respect\nof any case pending before the courts at Pondicherry, the  State  Government\nof Pondicherry is the appropriate Government to appoint  Public  Prosecutor,\nAdditional Public Prosecutor or Special Public Prosecutor.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">18. However, we make it clear that the State of Pondicherry can appoint  any\ncounsel as Public Prosecutor having requisite qualifications  as  prescribed\nunder sub-section (8) of <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 24</a> CrPC whether  he  is  a  lawyer  in  the\nState of  Pondicherry  or  any  other  State.  As  it  is  a  criminal  case\nregistered by the State of Tamil Nadu the expenses for conducting the  trial\nare to be borne by the State of Tamil Nadu. The advocate&#x27;s fees  payable  to\nthe Public  Prosecutor,  Additional  Public  Prosecutor  or  Special  Public\nProsecutor by the State of Pondicherry shall be borne by the State of  Tamil\nNadu and the Home Departments of the two States may undertake  consultations\nwith each other and an appropriate decision may be taken by the  authorities\nconcerned in this regard&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\">16.    When the criminal case is  transferred  from  one  court  to  another\ncourt which is subordinate to another High Court, then the transferee  State\nacquires jurisdiction to appoint Public Prosecutor.  The  transferor  court,\nnamely, State of Tamil Nadu had no jurisdiction to appoint   Special  Public\nProsecutor  to represent D.V &amp; A.C in the criminal appeals before  the  High\nCourt  of  Karnataka.

Hence,  the  order  passed  by  the  State  of  Tamil  Nadu\nauthorizing the deleted third respondent herein to engage  the  services  of\nthe fifth respondent is without authority and non est in  the  eye  of  law.\nThat order does not confer any right on the fifth  respondent  to  represent\neither the State of Karnataka or the State of  Tamil  Nadu  in  the  pending\nappeals before this Court.  In view of our findings recorded above that  the\ntransferor court   has no  power  to  appoint  a  Public  Prosecutor   under\n<a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 24</a> of the Code in respect  of  a  case  pending  in  the  transferee\nCourt, the argument that the appellant has not challenged   the  said  order\nof appointment has no merit.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_172\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1886518\" id=\"span_19\">17.

By  a\nplain reading of  <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_147\">Section  24</a>  Cr.P.C.,  three  main  categories  of  Public\nProsecutors are  discernible:-  First  are  those  who  are  attached  to  a\nparticular High Court, District or Local Area;  Second  are  those  who  are\nattached to a  particular  case  or  class  of  cases  but  in  a  specified\njurisdiction and lastly, the one appointed to a  particular  case  or  class\nof cases.

Section 301 of the Code is  a  pivotal  provision  which  deals  with\n&#x27;appearance of Public Prosecutor&#x27; giving a substantive right to  the  Public\nProsecutor who is &#x27;in charge of a case&#x27;  to appear and plead  in  any  court\nin which that case is under inquiry, trial  or  appeal  without  having  any\nwritten authority.  The scheme of the Code is that when a  case  is  at  the\nstage of inquiry, trial or appeal, the Public Prosecutor  is  in  charge  of\nthe case and he is authorized to appear before any court in which that  case\nis under inquiry, trial or appeal, without any  written  authority.  One  of\nthe reasons for dispensing with the  requirement  of  written  authority  to\nappear and plead under Section 301 of the Code  is that the  Special  Public\nProsecutor appears for the State to prosecute the  accused.  State  in  turn\nauthorize and appoint the Special Public Prosecutor  to act  on  its  behalf\nby issuing a notification and until that  notification  is  quashed  by  the\nState, the power under sub-section (1) of Section 301  of  the  Code,   will\ncontinue  the authority of Special Public Prosecutor  to  appear  and  plead\neven after end of trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_190\">31.

In fact, this  is  the  intention  which  can  be\ninferred from the changes brought in the new Code as  compared  to  the  old\nCode of 1898.  In the old Code, there were only two classes (i.e. those  who\nhave been empowered to prosecute generally and other who  are  empowered  to\ndeal with specific cases) that too  in  a  single  provision,  which  talked\nabout Public Prosecutors under Section 492 of the  old  Code.

That  is  the\nreason why Special Public Prosecutor can be allowed to appear in  the  case,\nwhen the same went in  appeal from trial and the Public Prosecutor  and  the\nAssistant Public Prosecutor cannot be allowed to do so  because  of  element\nof &#x27;Court or area&#x27; limitation imposed upon   them  in  which  they  have  to\nwork.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_192\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"385118\" id=\"span_23\">34.

In the backdrop of the above  provisions  we  have  to  understand  the\npurport of Section 301 of the Code. Unlike its succeeding provision  in  the\nCode, the application of  which  is  confined  to  Magistrate  Courts,  this\nparticular  section  is  applicable  to   all   the   courts   of   criminal\njurisdiction. This distinction can  be  discerned  from  employment  of  the\nwords &quot;any court&quot; in Section 301. In view  of  the  provision  made  in  the\nsucceeding section as for Magistrate  Courts  the  insistence  contained  in\nSection 301(2) must be understood as applicable to all other courts  without\nany exception. The first  sub-section  empowers  the  Public  Prosecutor  to\nplead in the court without any written authority, provided he is  in  charge\nof the case. The second sub-section, which is sought to be  invoked  by  the\nappellant, imposes the curb on a counsel engaged by any  private  party.  It\nlimits his role to act in the  court  during  such  prosecution  &quot;under  the\ndirections of the Public Prosecutor&quot;. The only other liberty  which  he  can\npossibly exercise is to  submit  written  arguments  after  the  closure  of\nevidence in the trial, but that too can be done only if  the  court  permits\nhim to do so.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_193\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"385118\" id=\"span_24\">35.    <a href=\"/doc/385118/\" id=\"a_166\">Referring to Shiv  Kumar</a>&#x27;s  case(supra)  and  elaborating  upon  sub-\nsection (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1238795/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 301</a> Cr.P.C. and interpreting the  word  &#x27;a  case&#x27;  in\nparagraph (49) of the impugned judgment, the High Court held as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">&quot;49.

A conviction or acquittal by a trial  court  is  only  a\nstep amongst the several steps  in  which  a   criminal  case  has  to  pass\nthrough.  These statutory provisions have to be read as  a   whole  and  one\nprovision should be construed with reference  to  the  other  provision   to\nmake the provision  consistent with  the  object   sought  to  be  achieved.\nOtherwise, the word &#x27;any Court&#x27; used in Section 301 would become  redundant.\n When a Special Public Prosecutor  is appointed to a case, he  has  a  right\nto appear during inquiry, during trial and also during appeal.   He  is  not\nappointed to any Court   but appointed to a case.

Further the comparison of the provisions as to Public Prosecutors  in\nthe old Code and the new Code the following emerge:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">(a) In the old Code, provisions as to &#x27;Appointments of  Public  Prosecutor&#x27;,\n&#x27;Appearance  of  Public  Prosecutor&#x27;,  &#x27;Withdrawal  from   Prosecution   and\n&#x27;Permission  to  Conduct  Prosecution&#x27;   were   put   consecutively    under\nSections 492, 493, 494 &amp; 495  respectively,  in  Chapter  XXXVIII  -&#x27;Of  The\nPublic Prosecutor&#x27;  contained  in  the  Part  IX  of  the  Code   titled  as\nSupplementary Provisions;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">(b) However,  in  the  new  Code  all  the  provisions  relating  to  Public\nProsecutors are scattered in different chapters of  the  Code.   Section  24\nand Section  25  which  deal  with  appointment  of  Public  Prosecutor  and\nAssistant  Public  Prosecutor  respectively,  finds  place  in  Chapter  II-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_198\">&#x27;Constitution of Criminal Courts and Offices&#x27; of the Code. Provisions as  to\nAppearance  of  Public  Prosecutor,  Permission  to   Conduct   Prosecution,\nWithdrawal from  Prosecution have been enumerated under Sections  301,  302,\n321 of the Code respectively under Chapter XXIV-&#x27;General  Provisions  as  to\ninquiries and Trials&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_199\">Thus, under the old Code, provisions corresponding  to  <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_171\">Section  24</a>  Cr.P.C.\nand <a href=\"/doc/1238795/\" id=\"a_172\">Section 301</a> Cr.P.C. were under the same Chapter.   They  have  now  been\nplaced in different Chapters in the 1973 Code, however,  this  was  done  as\nmerely a part of the scheme of the Code. Therefore, it  would  be  wrong  to\nsuggest that interpretation  of  <a href=\"/doc/709330/\" id=\"a_173\">Section  24(8)</a>  Cr.P.C.  alongwith  <a href=\"/doc/1402254/\" id=\"a_174\">Section\n301(1)</a> Cr.P.C. would be in violation to the scheme of the Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_200\">38.    Whether <a href=\"/doc/1238795/\" id=\"a_175\">Section 301</a> Cr.P.C. is only procedural  in  nature:   Section\n301 has been placed under Chapter XXIV  of  the  Code  which  is  titled  as\n&#x27;General provisions as to  inquiries  and  trials&#x27;.  Contention  of  learned\nSenior Counsel for the appellant is that since  <a href=\"/doc/1238795/\" id=\"a_176\">Section  301</a>  Cr.P.C.  finds\nmention in the Chapter containing &#x27;General provisions as  to  inquiries  and\ntrials&#x27;, <a href=\"/doc/1238795/\" id=\"a_177\">Section 301</a> Cr.P.C. is only procedural in nature and thus does  not\nconfer any substantive right to the Public Prosecutor who is in charge of  a\ncase, to appear and plead and it is only a facilitating provision to  appear\nwithout any written authority.   It was  further  submitted  that  when  the\nnotification appointing Mr. Bhavani Singh was confined only  to  Special  CC\nNo.208/2004,  support  cannot  be  drawn  from  <a href=\"/doc/1238795/\" id=\"a_178\">Section  301</a>   Cr.P.C.   for\ncontinuance of his authority to appear in the appeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_201\">39.    In my  considered  view,  the  said  argument  is  misplaced.  Though\nChapter XXIV  deals  with  the  &#x27;General  provisions  as  to  inquiries  and\ntrials&#x27;,  it  also  contains  various  sections  which   if   not   observed\nmandatorily, will have serious repercussions on the  substantive  rights  of\nthe parties.  For  example,  Section  327  provides  that  trial  should  be\nconducted in open Court. If a by-pass  is  allowed  through  this  provision\nwhich confers substantive rights in favour of party,then it may vitiate  the\nentire trial. Moreover, Section 327 not  only  vests  substantive  right  in\nfavour of parties to have open trial  and  to  have  &#x27;in  camera&#x27;  trial  in\ncertain matters, but also embodies  the  principle  of  natural  justice  of\n&#x27;fairness in conduct of trial&#x27;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_202\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1112391\" id=\"span_25\">40.    Coming to the relevant Section,  i.e.  <a href=\"/doc/1402254/\" id=\"a_179\">Section  301(1)</a>  Cr.P.C.  also\ngives substantive right to the Public Prosecutor who  is  &#x27;in  charge  of  a\ncase&#x27; to appear and plead without having   any  written  authority.  Further\nas per sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1238795/\" id=\"a_180\">Section  301</a>  Cr.P.C.,  if  a  victim  chooses  to\nappoint some private pleader on his/her behalf, then  such  private  pleader\nwill act  under the direction of the Public Prosecutor. Mandatory nature  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1521964/\" id=\"a_181\">Section 301(2)</a> Cr.P.C. has been considered and upheld by  this  Court  in  a\ncatena of decisions.  A Constitution Bench of this Court   in  the  case  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1112391/\" id=\"a_182\">State of Punjab vs. Surjit Singh  And Anr.</a>, (1967) 2 SCR 347  while  dealing\nwith Section 493 of the old Code which is in pari materia with  Section  301\nof the new Code and held as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1112391\" id=\"span_26\">&quot;...That s.493 deals with a single specified case that it  applies  only  to\nthe Public Prosecutor, who is actually in charge of that case is  also  made\nclear  by the later part of s.493.  That  is  to  the  effect  that  if  the\nPublic  Prosecutor  is  in  charge  of  a  particular  case  and,   in  that\nparticular case, a private person  instructs  a  pleader  to  prosecute  any\nperson, the Public Prosecutor alone is entitled to conduct  the  prosecution\nand the pleader appearing <a href=\"/doc/1112391/\" id=\"a_183\">in that case</a> for the private  person  is  only  to\nact under his instructions...&quot;.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_203\">Though Chapter XXIV deals with  &#x27;General  provisions  as  in  inquiries  and\ntrials&#x27;, it also contains various sections dealing with  substantive  rights\nof the parties. The appellant is not   right in contending that <a href=\"/doc/1238795/\" id=\"a_184\">Section  301</a>\nCr.P.C. is only procedural and such contention is  not  in  consonance  with\nthe  scheme  of  the  Code.   In  my  view,  <a href=\"/doc/1402254/\" id=\"a_185\">Section  301(1)</a>  Cr.P.C.  gives\nsubstantive right to the Public Prosecutor who is in charge  of  a  case  to\nappear and plead without any written authority in any Court  in  which  that\ncase is under trial, inquiry or appeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_204\">41.

Since both Public  Prosecutor  and  Special  Public  Prosecutor\nhave been entrusted with certain overlapping task,  there  is  bound  to  be\noverlapping. To narrow  down  the  overlapping,  the  Legislature  has  very\ncarefully placed the word  &#x27;in  charge  of  a  case&#x27;  under  Section  301(1)\nCr.P.C.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_205\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1493500\" id=\"span_27\">42.    This issue has been addressed and answered by  a  Constitution  Bench\nin  the  case  of  <a href=\"/doc/1493500/\" id=\"a_189\">Surjit  Singh</a>&#x27;s  case  (supra).  In  that   case,   while\ninterpreting  in  pari  materia  i.e.  Section  493  of  the  old  Code  and\nconsidering the question as to whether a  Public  Prosecutor  or  a  Special\nPublic Prosecutor will be entitled to file an  application  for  withdrawing\nfrom prosecution and observing that only the Public  Prosecutor  who  is  in\ncharge of a particular case will be  entitled  to  file  an  application  to\nwithdraw from the prosecution, this Court held as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">&quot;......If any Public Prosecutor, who had nothing to  do  with  a  particular\ncase is held entitled to file  an application under s. 494, in our  opinion,\nthe result will be very anomalous.  For instance, if there  are  two  Public\nProsecutors appointed  for  a  particular  Court,  and  one  of  the  Public\nProsecutors is  conducting  the  prosecution   in  a  particular  case,  and\ndesires to go on with the proceedings, it will be open to the  other  Public\nProsecutor to ask for withdrawal from the prosecution.  Similarly, a  Public\nProsecutor appointed for  case  A,  before  a  particular   Court,  can,  by\nvirtue of his being a Public Prosecutor,  file an  application  in  case  B,\nwith which he has nothing to do, and ask for  permission  of  the  Court  to\nwithdraw from the prosecution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">The  reasonable interpretation to be placed upon s. 494, in our opinion   is\nthat  it is only  the Public Prosecutor, who is  incharge  of  a  particular\ncase  and  is  actually  conducting   the  prosecution,  that  can  file  an\napplication under that section, seeking  permission  to  withdraw  from  the\nprosecution.  If  a Public Prosecutor is  not in  charge  of   a  particular\ncase and is not conducting the prosecution, he will not be entitled  to  ask\nfor withdrawal from prosecution, under s. 494 of the Code.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_206\">43.    Being placed &#x27;in  charge  of  a  case&#x27;,  there  is  a  specific  role\nattributed to  the  Special  Public  Prosecutor  under  sub-section  (8)  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_190\">Section  24</a>  Cr.P.C.  which  distinguishes  the  task  of   Special   Public\nProsecutor  from that of  Public Prosecutors  appointed  under  sub-sections\n(1), (2) and (3) of  <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_191\">Section 24</a> Cr.P.C. and hardly there is any anomaly.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_207\">44.    Re. Contention: the term &quot;case&quot;  is  restricted  only  to  trial  and\ndoes  not  ipso  facto  extend  to  appeal:   It has been contended  by  the\nlearned Senior Counsel for the appellant that the term &#x27;case&#x27; is  restricted\nto only trial of the accused and  with the disposal of the  matter   in  the\ntrial court, the authority of Special Public  Prosecutor  comes  to  an  end\nand does not extend ipso facto  to plead and  appear  before  the  appellate\nforum also.  Thus, the learned Senior Counsel for the appellant argues  that\nthe term &#x27;case&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/709330/\" id=\"a_192\">Section 24(8)</a> Cr.P.C.  and  <a href=\"/doc/1238795/\" id=\"a_193\">Section  301</a>  Cr.P.C.  has\nbeen used in the restrictive sense by the Legislature to  include  only  the\ntrial and not the appeal. According to the appellant this is  reinforced  by\nthe appointment of Mr. Bhavani Singh by the Government of Tamil  Nadu  as  a\nSpecial Public Prosecutor to  represent  the  D.V  &amp;  A.C  in  the  criminal\nappeals before the High Court  of  Karnataka.   It  was  submitted  that  by\nappointing Mr. Bhavani Singh as the Special Public Prosecutor to appear  and\nplead  before  the  appellate  court,  the  Government  of  Tamil  Nadu  was\nconscious that the authority of Mr. Bhavani Singh has come to  an  end  with\nthe conclusion of the trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_208\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"417970\" id=\"span_28\">45.    The above contention does not  merit  acceptance.   Hasty  action  of\nGovernment of Tamil Nadu in appointing     Mr. Bhavani Singh is  ill-advised\nand such non-est action of the Government of Tamil  Nadu  does  not  whittle\ndown the provisions of law.  In my considered  view,  the  word  &#x27;case&#x27;  has\nbeen given a broader meaning in the context of  Section  301  of  the  Code.\nThe term &#x27;case&#x27; has to be interpreted only  contextually  and  no  universal\nrule can be laid down for its interpretation and therefore  the  Legislature\nin its wisdom has avoided  to  define  the  same  in  the  Code  inspite  of\nabundant presence in the various provisions  of  the  Code.  (vide  <a href=\"/doc/417970/\" id=\"a_194\">Bhimappa\nBassappa Bhu Sannavar vs. Laxman Shivarayappa Samagouda  &amp;  Ors.</a>,  (1970)  1\nSCC 665).</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_209\">46.    I am conscious that the term &#x27;case&#x27; in the Code at certain  instances\nhas been  used  to  link  only  with  &#x27;trial&#x27;  and  has  been  categorically\ndistinguished with the term &#x27;appeal&#x27;.  Cursory perusal  of  Section  407  of\nthe Code  which deals with &#x27;Power  of  High  Court  to  transfer  cases  and\nappeals&#x27;,  would   show  that  the  word  &#x27;case&#x27;  and  &#x27;appeal&#x27;   has   been\ndistinguished  by the Legislature in the context of the  section.   Further,\nsub-section (1) (ii) and (iv) of <a href=\"/doc/834094/\" id=\"a_195\">Section 407</a> Cr.P.C.  would  show  that  the\nterms &#x27;case or class of cases&#x27; and &#x27;appeal or appeals&#x27;  have  been  used  to\nmean different things.  Moreover,  the  word  &#x27;case&#x27;  as  evident  from  Sub\nClause (1) (ii) and (iv) of <a href=\"/doc/834094/\" id=\"a_196\">Section 407</a> Cr.P.C. would  show  that  the  word\n&#x27;case&#x27; has been distinctly used by the Legislature  in  respect  of   trial.\nSimilar distinction between term &#x27;case&#x27; and  &#x27;appeal&#x27;  has  been  maintained\nunder Section 406 and <a href=\"/doc/1498132/\" id=\"a_197\">Section 409</a> Cr.P.C.    Section 209 of  the  Code  also\nlinks the term &#x27;case&#x27; with the &#x27;trial&#x27; only. For example Section  209  deals\n&quot;Commitment of Case to Court of Session when offence is triable  exclusively\nby it&quot;.  If we insert the word &#x27;appeal&#x27; in place of word &#x27;case&#x27;,  then  such\ninterpretation may lead to an absurdity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_210\">47.    The term &#x27;case&#x27; had also become the subject matter of  interpretation\n in relation to <a href=\"/doc/135553/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 429</a>  of  Code  of  Criminal  Procedure,  1898  (&#x27;Old\nCode&#x27;) which deals with &quot;Procedure  where Judges  of  Court  of  appeal  are\nequally divided&quot;.  Section 429 of the Old  Code  is  in  pari  materia  with\nSection 392 of the New Code    with a slight but significant change  in  the\nlanguage.  The term &#x27;case&#x27; used in old Code has  been   replaced  with  term\n&#x27;appeal&#x27; in the new Code, due to the reason  of the mischief that  had  been\ncreated by the term &#x27;case&#x27;  in the old Code. The mischief was caused due  to\nthe wider meaning given to the term &#x27;case&#x27; by the  Courts  then.  It  is  to\nrectify this mischief; the new  Code  has  replaced  the  word  &#x27;case&#x27;  with\n&#x27;appeal&#x27;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_211\">48.    When the Legislature has remedied the mischief under Section  429  of\nthe old Code by replacing the term &#x27;case&#x27; with term &#x27;appeal&#x27;  under  Section\n392 of the new Code, then at that point of time, the Legislature could  have\ndefined the term &#x27;case&#x27;; but the Legislature opted not to do so and left  it\nto the Courts of Law to interpret the term  in  the  context  of  particular\nsection and facts of the cases. In the light of the above discussion, in  my\nview, the meaning that can be assigned to the term &#x27;case&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/1238795/\" id=\"a_199\">Section  301</a>\nCr.P.C. is contextually different and wider  than  the  provisions  <a href=\"/doc/417970/\" id=\"a_200\">referred\nabove</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_212\">49.    As  noted  earlier,  the  definition  of  &#x27;Public  Prosecutor&#x27;  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1492800/\" id=\"a_201\">Section 2 (u)</a> Cr.P.C. also includes a Special Public Prosecutor.  When  sub-\nsection (8) of <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 24</a> is read harmoniously with Section 301 of the  Code\non the touchstone of the enunciated principles, then  it  would  be  evident\nthat Special Public Prosecutor who is in charge of a  case  can  appear  and\nplead without any written authority in any court  of  criminal  jurisdiction\nin which such case is under inquiry, trial or appeal and in  my  view  there\nis no limitation either on territory or hierarchy of  courts.  There  is  no\nmerit in the contention of the learned  Senior  Counsel  for  the  appellant\nthat the authority of Special Public Prosecutor ends with the conclusion  of\nthe trial and disposal of a case. If such a contention  is  to  be  accepted\nthen the last few words of <a href=\"/doc/1238795/\" id=\"a_203\">Section 301</a> Cr.P.C.  &#x27;in any  court  where   that\ncase is  under inquiry,  trial   or  appeal&#x27;  would  become  redundant   and\nineffective.  It is a cardinal rule of interpretation that every word  in  a\nsection has a meaning and essence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_213\">50.    However, I am of the view that such authority of the  Special  Public\nProsecutor to appear and plead a case in respect of which he  is  in  charge\nin any court  or at any stage of proceedings in such court may  not  emanate\nfrom the term &#x27;case&#x27; or for that matter &#x27;class of cases&#x27; as appearing  under\n sub-section (8) of <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_204\">Section 24</a> Cr.P.C., but for the reason  of  the  broader\ncontext in which term &#x27;case&#x27; has been used  in  <a href=\"/doc/1402254/\" id=\"a_205\">Section  301(1)</a>  Cr.P.C.  to\ninclude any court in which that case is under  &#x27;inquiry, trial  or  appeal&#x27;.\nThe Special  Public  Prosecutor,  after  the  trial  is  over,  derives  its\nauthority to continue to appear and plead before appellate forum  by  virtue\nof language used in sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1238795/\" id=\"a_206\">Section 301</a> Cr.P.C.  and the  Special\nPublic Prosecutor  will  continue  to  have  such  authority   due  to  wide\nlanguage of <a href=\"/doc/1238795/\" id=\"a_207\">Section 301</a> Cr.P.C., until the notification appointing  him  has\nbeen cancelled by the appropriate State Government.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_214\">51.    To summarize the conclusion:   When  the  accused  has  filed  appeal\nagainst conviction in the High Court, then who can appear  before  the  High\nCourt on behalf of State-whether the  Public  Prosecutor  appointed  to  the\nHigh Court under sub-section (1) of  <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_208\">Section  24</a>  Cr.P.C.,  or  the  Special\nPublic Prosecutor already appointed, under <a href=\"/doc/709330/\" id=\"a_209\">Section  24(8)</a>  Cr.P.C.,  to  the\ncase under appeal.  In my considered opinion, the Special Public  Prosecutor\nappointed for the case would continue to be in charge  of  the  case  before\nthe High Court also.  The reason being, Special  Public  Prosecutor  is  not\nattached to a particular Court or Local area, but he  is   attached  to  the\n&#x27;case&#x27; or &#x27;class of cases&#x27;  and  therefore  Special  Public  Prosecutor  can\nappear without any written authority before any Court  where  that  case  is\nunder inquiry, trial or appeal.   Thus,  the  authority  of  Special  Public\nProsecutor  will follow the stage of case,  until  his  authority  has  been\nrevoked by the State in express terms. This is what  can  be  understood  by\nthe deliberate positioning of the words &#x27;inquiry,  trial  or  appeal&#x27;  after\nthe word &#x27;case&#x27;. In my considered  view,  once      Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  was\nappointed as the Special Public Prosecutor in charge of a case,  even  after\nend of the trial, he has a right to appear and  plead  in  any  court  where\nthat case is pending trial, inquiry or appeal.  The matter has been  pending\n for  more than eight years during which many orders passed by  the  Special\nCourt came to be challenged before the High Court, by way  of  revisions  or\nother proceedings. It was submitted by the Senior Counsel, Mr. Nariman  that\nin all those revisions and other proceedings  before  the  High  Court,  Mr.\nAcharya, the then Special Public Prosecutor appeared in the High  Court  and\nto substantiate the said submission, the order passed by the High  Court  in\nCriminal Petition No. 3683/2011 dated 19.08.2011 was produced before  us  in\nwhich Mr. B.V. Acharya Special Public  Prosecutor  himself  appeared  before\nthe High Court of Karnataka. Such appearance, in my view, is  by  virtue  of\nthe  authority  derived  under  <a href=\"/doc/1402254/\" id=\"a_210\">Section  301(1)</a>  Cr.P.C.   Thus,  after  the\nconclusion of the trial, by  virtue  of  accused  having  filed  the  appeal\nagainst the  decision  of  Sessions  Court,  the  right  of  Special  Public\nProsecutor will remain subsisting to appear and plead in the appeal also.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_215\">52.    Sequence of events happened after the  conviction:    In  the  entire\nmatter, the conduct of the appellant and the  State  of  Karnataka  is  very\nmuch relevant for which this Court  is  required  to  have  a  look  on  the\nsequence of events happened after the conviction. It is apposite to  briefly\nrefer to chronology sequence of events happened after Criminal Proceedings:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">27.09.2014 -  Case in Special Court in Special  CC  No.  208/2004  ended  in\nconviction against the accused.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">29.09.2014 -  All the Accused filed  the  Criminal  Appeal  Nos.835-838/2014\nbefore the High Court of Karnataka against the  order  of  conviction  dated\n27.09.2014. State of Karnataka  was  not  made  a  party-respondent  in  the\nCriminal Appeal.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">30.09.2014 -  Mr. Bhavani Singh (respondent No.5) appeared for the State  in\nthe Criminal  Appeal.   Notably,  no  objection  was  taken  either  by  the\nappellant or the State, that Bhavani Singh&#x27;s  authority  as  Special  Public\nProsecutor (SPP) was only till conclusion of trial.\n01.10.2014 - Mr. Bhavani Singh (respondent No.5) filed  Memo  of  Appearance\nin Criminal Appeal Nos. 835-838/2014 and submitted statement  of  objections\nthat the accused should not be granted bail.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">7.10.2014 -   Learned Single Judge of the High Court  of  Karnataka  refused\nto suspend the sentence awarded to  the  accused  persons  and  declined  to\ngrant them bail.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">17.10.2014 -  Supreme Court enlarged all the accused on bail.\n18.12.2014 -  This Court confirmed the order dated 17.10.2014  and  extended\nthe bail of accused by another four months.  This  Court  further  requested\nthe Chief Justice of High Court of Karnataka to constitute a  Special  Bench\nfor hearing of the appeals exclusively on day to day basis  and  dispose  of\nthe same as early as possible at any rate within three months.\n24.12.2014 -  Appellant, for the first  time  filed  representation  to  the\nChief Secretary, Government of Karnataka objecting to  the  continuation  of\nMr. Bhavani  Singh  as  SPP  in  the  Criminal  Appeals  and  requested  for\nappointment of some other Senior Counsels to contest the  appeals  filed  by\nthe accused persons.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">06.01.2015 -  Appellant filed  writ  petition  praying  to  appoint  another\nSenior Lawyer as Special Public Prosecutor to represent  the  State  in  the\ncriminal proceedings.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_216\">53.    Notably, from 30.09.2014 till 24.12.2014, no objection was  taken  by\nthe appellant or State of Karnataka  on  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  continuing  to\nappear and plead in the Criminal Appeal for  the  State.   In  the  Criminal\nAppeals before the High Court of Karnataka,  though  the  bail  applications\nwere taken up on various  hearing  dates  from  the  available  material  on\nrecord, it is seen that the State of Karnataka had not chosen  to  intervene\nraising objections for the authority of  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  continuing  to\nappear in the Criminal Appeals.  There was no  whisper  of  protest  by  any\nparty even when the matter came to this Court in  the  bail  proceedings  on\n17.10.2014 and 18.12.2014.  When, this Court  ordered  the  constitution  of\nSpecial Bench in Criminal Appeals vide order dated 18.12.2014, none  of  the\nparties took pain to seek clarification from this Court,  on  the  authority\nof Special Public Prosecutor to continue in proceedings of Criminal  Appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_217\">54.    The timing of representation dated 24.12.2014 filed by the  appellant\nto  the  State  of  Karnataka  is  also  interesting  to  note.   The   said\nrepresentation was made after this Court by its order dated  18.12.2014  had\ndirected hearing of the appeals on  day-to-day  basis  and  also  fixed  the\nperiod of three months for disposal of  the  appeals.  Miserably,  even  the\nState of Karnataka did not attempt to react on  the  representation  of  the\nappellant.  The issue could have been well resolved at that stage, if  State\nwould have consulted the Chief Justice of the High  Court  of  Karnataka  or\nwould have asked the clarification from this Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_218\">55.    On 6.01.2015, appellant filed a  W.P.  No.742/2015  before  the  High\nCourt of Karnataka, seeking replacement  of  respondent  No.5-  Mr.  Bhavani\nSingh, who was continuing to appear for the State  in  the  Criminal  Appeal\n             Nos.835-838/2014.   Interestingly,  here  again  the  appellant\nchose to file the Writ Petition before the  High  Court  instead  of  taking\ndirectly  recourse  to  the  jurisdiction  of  this  Court.   On  7.01.2015,\nappellant filed memo in the Criminal Appeal      Nos.  835-838/2014  stating\nthat respondent No.5- Mr. Bhavani Singh  is  not  authorized  to  appear  in\nCriminal Appeal         Nos. 835-838/2014, as the respondent  No.5  has  not\nbeen appointed by the State Government of  Karnataka  in  consultation  with\nthe Chief Justice  of  Karnataka  High  Court  to  appear  in  the  Criminal\nAppeals.  On  19.01.2015,  learned  Single  Judge  disposed  of   the   W.P.\nNo.742/2015 with an observation that &quot;...it is open  either  for  the  State\nGovernment  of  Karnataka  or  the  petitioner  himself,  to  seek   further\nclarifications from the Supreme Court as to the  procedure  that  is  to  be\nfollowed in making  appointment  of  a  Special  Public  Prosecutor  and  an\nassistant or assistants, if any, to represent the  State  of  Karnataka...&quot;.\nNoteworthy, in  the  proceedings  before  the  Single  Judge,  the  Advocate\nGeneral for the State  of  Karnataka  Mr.  Ravi  Kumar  made  the  following\nsubmissions:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">&quot;The learned Advocate General would however, submit that after the  judgment\nwas pronounced by the trial court, there has been  no  further  consultation\nbetween the State Government of Karnataka and the Chief Justice of the  High\nCourt of  Karnataka,  as  directed  by  the  Supreme  Court  in  making  any\nappointment of a Special Public  prosecutor  and  there  is  no  appointment\norder issued in favour of respondent No.5, afresh; he would  further  submit\nthat if it is a formality to be complied  with,  the  State  Government,  in\nconsultation with the Chief Justice, shall take further  steps.   Since  the\nState Government is not formally authorized to take any steps in so  far  as\nthe appointments of the prosecutor or counsel to  conduct  the  appeals,  no\nsteps have been taken.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_219\">56.    Notably, State of  Karnataka,  even  after  the  decision  of  Single\nJudge, did not take any action. The State of  Karnataka  did  not  file  any\nappeal against the order of the Single  Judge.   They  neither  pursued  the\nmatter with the Chief Justice of High Court of Karnataka nor did  they  take\nthe pain to approach the Supreme Court  to  seek  clarification  as  to  the\nappointment of Prosecutor/Counsel in Criminal Appeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_220\">57.    On 28.01.2015, appellant filed the  Writ  Appeal    No.260/2015  (GM-\nRES) before the Division Bench against the order dated 19.01.2015 of  Single\nJudge instead of directly coming to  this  Court  to  seek  the  appropriate\nclarification as to the continuation of the  Special  Public  Prosecutor  in\nthe Criminal Appeal or to pursue the matter with  the  State  of  Karnataka.\nThe learned Advocate General again made his submissions that in  absence  of\nclarification from Supreme Court, the State is unable to take  the  decision\non the appointment of Prosecutor/Counsel for Criminal Appeal.  The  relevant\nsubmissions may be noted as below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">&quot;As earlier, the appointment was made in pursuance of the  direction  issued\nby the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court, their understanding is that the obligation  to\nappoint was only during trial. With the trial coming  to  an  end  with  the\norder  of  conviction,  that  obligation  ceases.   As  there  is  no  fresh\ndirection issued by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court to appoint  a  Special  Public\nProsecutor, they have not made any such appointment.  Though the  State  has\nappointed a Public Prosecutor under  <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_211\">Section  24(1)</a>  of  the  Code,  in  the\nabsence of any direction from the Apex Court, the said Public Prosecutor  is\nnot appearing in the pending appeals before the High Court.  As  the  matter\nis sub judice, they have not taken any further action in this matter.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_221\">On  11.02.2015,  Division  Bench  disposed  of  the  Writ  Appeal  with   an\nobservation that  respondent  No.5  is  entitled  to  continue  in  Criminal\nAppeals. The Division Bench observed as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">&quot;In fact, what weighed with the learned Single Judge in rejecting  the  Writ\nPetition is the direction issued by the Apex Court that  the  Appeal  should\nbe heard on day to day basis and it  should  be  disposed  of  within  three\nmonths, any order to be passed by this Court which would come in the way  of\nthe disposal of the said appeal in terms of the  direction  of  the  Supreme\nCourt should be avoided....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_222\">58.    Even after the decision of Division Bench in  the  Writ  Appeal,  the\nState did not pursue the matter to this Court.  What the State did  is  that\nthey took the shelter of the appeals filed by  the  appellant  and  kept  on\nrhyming about  their  inability  to  appoint  a  new  Prosecutor/Counsel  to\nconduct the appeal proceedings.  If the State of Karnataka was of  the  view\nthat Mr. Bhavani Singh  cannot  continue  to  appear  for  the  appeals,  in\nconsultation with the Chief Justice of Karnataka High Court, it  could  have\nissued the notification appointing another Special Public Prosecutor  or  it\ncould have sought direction from this Court.  But that was  not  to  be  so.\nState of Karnataka did not take  any  initiative  to  actively  resolve  the\ndispute so that the appeal could have been  disposed  of  within  the  outer\nlimits of three months from the order dated 18.12.2014.  Once the  case  was\ntransferred under <a href=\"/doc/664789/\" id=\"a_212\">Section 406</a> Cr.P.C. to the State of Karnataka, it  stepped\ninto the shoes of State of Tamil Nadu and has the  obligation  to  prosecute\nall the accused diligently by ensuring the fair and  smooth  proceedings  of\nthe case and as the transferee State, the State of Karnataka  was  conscious\nabout its obligations. However, the State with  its  inactive  attitude  did\nnot take any step to terminate Bhavani Singh&#x27;s service and  thereby  appoint\na new incumbent to conduct the case in appeal. The appellant  did  not  take\nsteps immediately after the disposal of the matter in  the  trial  court  as\nthe appellant was conscious of the right  of  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh-respondent\nNo.5 to  continue  as  the  Special  Public  Prosecutor  by  virtue  of  the\nprovision of <a href=\"/doc/940317/\" id=\"a_213\">Section 24 (8)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1402254/\" id=\"a_214\">Section 301(1)</a> of Cr.P.C.  unless  cancelled\nby the State of Karnataka.  It is pertinent to note that the  appellant  had\nnot even chosen to  challenge  the  appointment  of  Mr.  Bhavani  Singh  as\nSpecial Public Prosecutor by the  State  of  Tamil  Nadu  (dated  29.9.2014)\nwhich is prima facie non-est.  Only after this Court  passed  the  order  on\n18.12.2014, fixing the  outer  time  limit  for  disposal  of  the  criminal\nappeals, the appellant seems to  have  made  representation  and  thereafter\nfiled writ petition, which in my  considered  view,  lacks  bona  fide.  The\nlearned Single Judge and the  Division  Bench  rightly  dismissed  the  Writ\nPetition No.742/2015 and Writ Appeal No.260/2015 (GM-RES) and  the  impugned\njudgment warrants no interference.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_223\">59.
