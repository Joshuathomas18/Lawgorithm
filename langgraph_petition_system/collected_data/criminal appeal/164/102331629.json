The undisputed facts of the appeal arising out of S.L.P.\n\n(Crl.) No. 5623 of 2012 are that appellant No. 2 is the owner of\n\nappellant No. 1 Company. The respondent No. 2, who is in the\n\nbusiness of manufacture, process and marketing of petroleum\n\nproducts, has a ‘Company Owned Company Operated’ retail\n\noutlet at Village Gadu, Maliya Hatina Taluq, District Junagadh,\n\nGujarat. Appellants entered into a contract with the Respondent\n\nNo. 2 Corporation for performing various contractual jobs. As\n\nper the terms of the contract, the appellants were required to\n\nundertake the contracted jobs and to deposit the money out of\n\nsale proceeds on a daily basis in the State Bank of India,\n\nVeraval Branch. The business dealings between the parties\n\nwere going on since 1996 and in terms of the contract\n\nappellants furnished to the Respondent No. 2, two Cheques\n\nbearing Nos. 884572 and 884574, dated 24 th June, 2000 for\n\nRs.10 lakhs and Rs.25 lakhs, respectively. When the cheques\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                   4</span>\n\n\nwere presented for realization, they bounced with the\n\nendorsement “not arranged for”.        Hence, respondent No. 2\n\ninitiated criminal proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 138</a> of the\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act, 1881 (for short ‘the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_2\">N.I. Act</a>’)\n\nagainst the appellants and filed Criminal Complaint No. 2131 of\n\n2000.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">3.      Before the Trial Court it was argued on behalf of\n\nRespondent No.2—Corporation that the cheques in question\n\nwere issued by the appellants to discharge their part liability for\n\nclearing the dues whereas the case of the appellants was that\n\nthere were no dues payable to the Respondent Corporation and\n\nthe Cheques were taken by the complainant—Corporation as\n\n‘guarantee’ and misused the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">4.      The Trial Court acquitted the appellant No. 2—accused\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1454285/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 255(1)</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code (<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_4\">Cr.P.C</a>.)\n\nholding that considering the facts and circumstances and taking\n\ninto account the evidence and the settled principles of law,\n\ncomplainant has failed to prove the charge against the accused\n\nand under the circumstances, it is not possible to hold the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                   5</span>\n\n\naccused guilty for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 138</a> of\n\nthe Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"194254\" id=\"span_3\">5.    Aggrieved by the judgment of the learned Trial Judge, the\n\nrespondent No. 2—complainant challenged it in an appeal\n\nbefore the High Court of Gujarat under <a href=\"/doc/487026/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 378</a>, Cr.P.C. It\n\nwas contended before the High Court on behalf of the\n\ncomplainant—Corporation that the evidence was recorded by\n\none Magistrate and relying on the same evidence, his\n\nsuccessor Magistrate delivered the judgment. Therefore, the\n\ntrial was vitiated as the case was tried ‘summarily’ under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 143</a> of the N.I. Act, and the successor Magistrate could\n\nnot have relied upon the evidence recorded by his predecessor.\n\nPlacing reliance on this Court’s decision in <a href=\"/doc/194254/\" id=\"a_8\">Nitinbhai Saevatilal\n\nShah Vs. Manubhai Manjibhai Panchal</a> AIR 2011 SC 3076,\n\nthe complainant submitted that the matter be remanded to the\n\nTrial Court for a de novo trial,</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">6.    The High Court observed that the learned Magistrate who\n\ndelivered the judgment was not in a position to appreciate the\n\nevidence properly and decide the matter effectively to do\n\nsubstantial justice as he formed the opinion relying upon the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                   6</span>\n\n\nevidence recorded by his predecessor. It, therefore, caused\n\nserious prejudice to the complainant as an order of acquittal\n\nwas passed. Hence, the High Court allowed the appeal and\n\nremanded the matter to the Trial Court for a fresh trial in\n\naccordance with law after giving opportunity to the parties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">7.    Dissatisfied with the High Court’s judgment, the accused\n\n—appellants assailed it in appeal before this Court. On 6 th\n\nAugust,   2012,   this   Court   while   issuing   notice,   stayed\n\nproceedings going on before the learned Magistrate in\n\npursuance of the remand order passed by the High Court.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">8.    The brief facts of S.L.P. (Crl.) No. 3332 of 2012 are that at\n\nthe relevant time, the complainant—Jayesh Thakker was the\n\nManager of Respondent No.1 firm (D.M. Finance). Appellant\n\nNos. 2 to 5 were Directors of the Appellant No. 1 Company\n\nwhich runs the business of proteins. They entered into a\n\ntransaction with the Respondent No. 1 firm for purchase of\n\ncastor stocks. It is alleged that the Appellant Nos. 2 to 5 had\n\npurchased the stock of castor seeds and as per the statement\n\nof account, the appellants paid only Rs.28,66,677/- and an\n\namount of Rs.41,89,364/- was outstanding.          The appellants,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                   7</span>\n\n\ntherefore, issued three cheques bearing No.585977           dated\n\n27.6.2001    for   Rs.3,00,000/,   cheque     No.   585979        for\n\nRs.2,00,000/- and cheque No. 585980 for Rs.2,00,000/- drawn\n\non Laxmi Vilas Bank Ltd., Gondal Road, Rajkot towards part\n\npayment. When these cheques were presented for realization,\n\nthey were dishonoured by the Bank with endorsement\n\n“insufficient funds”.   Respondent No. 1 issued notice dated\n\n10.7.2001 to the appellants and upon their failure to obey the\n\nnotice, he filed a Complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">9.    Before the Trial Court, the appellants denied having\n\ncommitted the offence and the complainant has adduced\n\nevidence.    By an order dated 30.5.2009 the Trial Court\n\nacquitted the accused—appellants. The Respondent No. 1—\n\ncomplainant challenged the acquittal order in an appeal before\n\nthe High Court of Gujarat under Section 378, Cr.P.C.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">10.   It was mainly contended by the complainant before the\n\nHigh Court that the Trial Court committed illegality as the\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 138</a> of NI Act has to be tried in summary\n\nmanner and a part of evidence was recorded by one Magistrate\n\nand remaining part of evidence was recorded by a successor\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                   8</span>\n\n\nMagistrate who delivered the judgment. The High Court, placing\n\nreliance on Nitinbhai remanded the matter to the Trial Court for\n\na de novo trial. Aggrieved by the remand order passed by the\n\nHigh Court, the accused—appellants preferred the present\n\nappeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">11.   This Court, by an order dated 27 th August, 2012 issued\n\nnotice and stayed proceedings before the learned Magistrate in\n\npursuance of the remand order passed by the High Court. This\n\nCourt also directed to tag on this matter with SLP (Crl) No. 5623\n\nof 2012.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">12.   As regards the appeal arising out of S.L.P. (Crl.) No. 734\n\nof 2013, the facts in a nutshell are that the Respondent No.1—\n\ncomplainant was the owner of Ranjan High School in\n\nBapunagar, Ahmedabad and the accused—appellant was\n\nengaged with the activities of the school. The accused—\n\nappellant took hand loan of Rs.3,57,000/- from the respondent\n\nNo. 1. To fulfil his obligation, the appellant issued a cheque No.\n\n481551 dated 25.8.1998 for Rs.2,97,000/- and another cheque\n\nNo. 481552 dated 25.10.1998 for Rs. 60,000/- drawn on\n\nGandhinagar Nagrik Co-operative Bank, Sachivalaya Branch,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                    9</span>\n\n\nGandhinagar. Upon presentation, the cheques were returned\n\nby the bank unpaid on account of insufficient funds. A notice\n\nwas served upon the accused—appellant on 17.11.1998\n\ndemanding payment and upon his failure to comply with the\n\nnotice,   the   respondent   No.1—complainant    filed   criminal\n\ncomplaint before the Trial Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">13.   Accused pleaded not guilty and after conducting the trial.\n\nThe Trial Court by an order dated 7.8.2009 acquitted the\n\nappellant—accused holding him innocent as per <a href=\"/doc/1454285/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 255(1)</a>\n\nof the Cr.P.C. Aggrieved thereby, the respondent No. 1\n\npreferred appeal under <a href=\"/doc/487026/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 378</a> of Cr.P.C. before the High\n\nCourt. The High Court, by the impugned judgment, observed\n\nthat the case was transferred from one Metropolitan Magistrate\n\nto another and the Magistrate who recorded the evidence did\n\nnot pass judgment.     Placing reliance on Nitinbhai the High\n\nCourt allowed the appeal and remanded the matter to the Trial\n\nCourt for de novo trial. Against the order passed by the High\n\nCourt remanding the matter for de novo trial, the accused—\n\nappellant preferred the present appeal.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                  10</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">14.   This Court, by an order dated 14 th January, 2013 issued\n\nnotice and stayed proceedings before the learned Magistrate in\n\npursuance of the remand order passed by the High Court. The\n\nmatter was also directed to be tagged with SLP (Crl) No. 5623\n\nof 2012.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">15.   That is how all these appeals are placed before us. In all\n\nthree matters, the rival contentions of the parties are more or\n\nless similar and as the issue involved is one and the same, they\n\nare being dealt with and disposed of commonly.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">16.   Learned counsel for the appellants contended that even\n\nthough the learned Magistrate who rendered the judgment was\n\nnot the same who recorded the evidence, the fact remains that\n\nthe order of acquittal was recorded only after appreciating the\n\nentire evidence in its proper perspective and after giving an\n\nopportunity to both sides to present their case. Not only that,\n\nthe learned Magistrate, before delivering the judgment, has\n\ngiven ample opportunity to the parties to bring on record their\n\nevidence in detail. The learned Magistrate analyzed the entire\n\noral as well as documentary evidence. After taking into account\n\nall material aspects, the Trial Court framed the issues and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                    11</span>\n\n\npassed reasoned order arriving at a conclusion that no iota of\n\nevidence is produced by the complainant to show that any\n\namount was due and recoverable from the accused and the\n\ncomplainant has failed to prove that the Cheques in question\n\nwere issued by the accused towards a legally enforceable debt.\n\nWhile passing the order of acquittal, the Trial Court also\n\nconsidered the settled principles of law <a href=\"/doc/194254/\" id=\"a_13\">laid down by</a> this Court\n\nand came to the conclusion that the accused is not guilty of the\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act. Therefore, in view of\n\nthe exercise undertaken by the learned Judge, the trial in\n\nquestion could not be termed as a ‘summary trial’ and there is\n\nno impropriety involved in the judgment of the Trial Court. The\n\nHigh Court, while allowing the appeal of the complainant by\n\nsetting aside the order of acquittal and directing for a de novo\n\ntrial, failed to take into consideration the prejudice caused to the\n\naccused and further failed to follow the principles of natural\n\njustice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">17.   Learned counsel, drawing our attention to the nature of\n\n‘summary trial’, submitted that in the present case (SLP(Crl)\n\nNo. 5623 of 2012), recording of the evidence of PW 1 was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                   12</span>\n\n\ncommenced on 19th December, 2002 and <a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_15\">Sections 143</a> to <a href=\"/doc/177946336/\" id=\"a_16\">147</a>\n\nof the N.I. Act came to be inserted by the Negotiable\n\nInstruments (amendment and Miscellaneous Provisions) Act,\n\n2002 only w.e.f. 6th February, 2003, empowering the Court to try\n\nall offences under <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_17\">Chapter XVII of the N.I. Act</a> ‘summarily’.\n\nThus, the change of law after the commencement of recording\n\nevidence cannot be applied to the present case and the\n\njudgment of the trial Court cannot be treated as a result of\n\n‘summary trial’. Moreover,     the exercise undertaken by the\n\nlearned Magistrate during the course of trial by examining the\n\nwitnesses, marking of documents, recording of entire evidence\n\nin detail, cross examination and chief examination etc., shows\n\nthat he tried the case not ‘summarily’ but in a regular way. For\n\nthe simple reason that the learned Magistrate has failed to\n\nmention that the case was tried in a regular way but not\n\n‘summarily’, the trial would not get vitiated. The final verdict of\n\nthe Trial Court that “considering all facts and circumstances,\n\nand considering the evidence and the settled principles of\n\nlaw and evidence, complainant has failed to prove the\n\ncharge    against    the   accused      and   under    all   these\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                  13</span>\n\n\ncircumstances, it is not possible to hold the accused guilty\n\nand convict him” explains in clear terms that the decision was\n\npassed after undergoing a regular trial following complete\n\nprocedure in accordance with the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_18\">Cr.P.C</a>. Keeping in mind the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/338903/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 465</a>, Cr.P.C., the High Court ought not to\n\nhave reversed the finding of the Trial Court on account of any\n\nerror, omission or irregularity in the complaint or order,\n\njudgment or other proceedings during trial or inquiry until and\n\nunless the Court feels that failure of justice has in fact\n\noccasioned   thereby. Learned counsel,       taking cue from\n\nsub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/338903/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 465</a>, Cr.P.C., submitted that it is the\n\nbounden duty of respondents—complainants to raise the\n\nobjection, if any, at the earliest stage before the Trial Court\n\nitself. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"132548468\" id=\"span_12\">But the complainants had not raised any such objection\n\nthat being summary proceedings, the learned Magistrate who\n\ndelivered the judgment cannot act on the evidence recorded by\n\nhis predecessor.

They\n\nprovide flexibility to the Magistrate to come to a conclusion that\n\nat any stage of the trial, if the Magistrate thinks that it would not\n\nbe desirable to hold a summary trial, he may call for cross\n\nexamination, chief examination and recall any witness. For\n\ndoing so, however, the Magistrate has to record reasons.

In what circumstances a case should be remanded\n\n        back for de novo trial?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">24.   The Legislature, having noticed that the prevailing\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_49\">Sections 138</a> to <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_50\">142</a> of the N.I.

To achieve the purpose of “speedy\n\ndisposal”, the Legislature has recommended a simplified\n\nprocedure for trial of the offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_53\">N.I. Act</a> i.e.\n\n‘summary trial’. The amendment to the Act also made the\n\noffence ‘compoundable’ as the punishment provided in the\n\nunamended Act was inadequate and the procedure was found\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\f                                   19</span>\n\n\nto be cumbersome. Thus, incorporation of <a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_54\">Sections 143</a> to <a href=\"/doc/177946336/\" id=\"a_55\">147</a>\n\nwas especially aimed at early disposal of cases in a simplified\n\nprocedure and more particularly, to do away with all the stages\n\nand processes in a regular criminal trial that normally cause\n\ninordinate delay in its conclusion and to make the trial\n\nprocedure as expeditious as possible without in any way\n\ncompromising with the right of the accused for a fair trial. This\n\nresults in overcoming the huge docket of Courts with matters\n\npertaining to dishonour of cheques as their prolonged trials\n\nbecame a serious matter of concern.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">25.   Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 143</a> of the N.I. Act makes it\n\nclear that all offences under <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_57\">Chapter XVII of the N.I. Act</a> shall be\n\ntried by the Magistrate ‘summarily’ applying, as far as may be,\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1799424/\" id=\"a_58\">Sections 262</a> to <a href=\"/doc/392607/\" id=\"a_59\">265</a> of Cr.P.C. It further provides\n\nthat in case of conviction in a summary trial, the Magistrate may\n\npass a sentence of imprisonment for a term not exceeding one\n\nyear and a fine exceeding Rs.5,000/-. Sub-section (1) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 143</a> of the N.I. Act further provides that during the\n\ncourse of a summary trial, if the Magistrate is of the opinion that\n\nthe nature of the case requires a sentence for a term exceeding\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                                    20</span>\n\n\none year or for any other reason, it is undesirable to try the\n\ncase summarily, the Magistrate shall, after hearing the parties,\n\nrecord an order to that effect and thereafter recall any witness\n\nwhom he had examined, or proceed to rehear the case.\n\nSub-section (2) mandates that so far as practicable, the\n\ntrial has to be conducted on a day to day basis until its\n\nconclusion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">26.   An analysis of <a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 143</a> brings out that the Magistrate,\n\ninitially, should try the case ‘summarily’ if he is of the opinion\n\nthat he is not going to pass sentence of imprisonment not\n\nexceeding one year and fine of Rs.5,000/- . In case during the\n\ncourse of trial, if the Magistrate forms a different opinion that in\n\nthe circumstances of the case, he may order a sentence of a\n\nterm exceeding one year, or for any other reason it is\n\nundesirable to try the case summarily, he must record the\n\nreasons for doing so and go for a ‘regular trial’. Thereafter, the\n\nMagistrate can also recall any witness who has been examined\n\nand proceed to hear or rehear the case. So, the second\n\nproviso to sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 143</a>, gives discretion\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                    21</span>\n\n\nto the Magistrate to conduct the case other than in\n\nsummary manner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1403861\" id=\"span_24\">27.

The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/59406578/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 146</a>\n      similarly depart from the principles of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_74\">Evidence\n      Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 143</a> makes it possible for the\n      complaints under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 138</a> of the Act to be tried\n      in the summary manner, except, of course, for the\n      relatively small number of cases where the\n      Magistrate feels that the nature of the case is such\n      that a sentence of imprisonment for a term\n      exceeding one year may have to be passed or that\n      it is, for any other reason, undesirable to try the\n      case summarily.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      21.

Even while following\n      the procedure of summary trials, the non obstante\n      clause and the expression “as far as possible” used\n      in <a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 143</a> coupled with the non obstante clause\n      in <a href=\"/doc/138755618/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 145</a> allow for the evidence of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                             22</span>\n\n\ncomplainant to be given on affidavit, that is, in the\nabsence of the accused.

We find that in the case of Nithinbhai, the complainant\n\nexamined himself along with other witnesses in support of his\n\ncase and produced documentary evidence. The accused,\n\nhowever, did not lead any defence evidence but in his\n\nexamination under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., the accused stated that\n\nhis signature was obtained on the blank paper by kidnapping\n\nhim, written something on it and filed a false complaint against\n\nhim. After recording evidence, the Metropolitan Magistrate\n\ncame to be transferred. Therefore, he ceased to exercise\n\njurisdiction. He was succeeded by another Magistrate before\n\nwhom both parties, i.e. the complainant as well as the accused,\n\nfiled a memo declaring that the parties had no objection to\n\nproceed with the matter on the basis of evidence recorded by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                   24</span>\n\n\nthe predecessor Magistrate in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1264755/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 326</a>, Cr.P.C. and\n\non that basis, learned Magistrate considered the evidence led\n\nby the complainant and passed judgment             convicting the\n\nappellants under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 138</a> of the N.I.

It is one of the important principles of\n      criminal law that the Judge who hears and records\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">\f                             25</span>\n\n\nthe entire evidence must give judgment. Section\n326 is an exception to the rule that only a person\nwho has heard the evidence in the case is\ncompetent to decide whether the accused is\ninnocent or guilty. The section is intended to meet\nthe case of transfers of Magistrates from one place\nto another and to prevent the necessity of trying\nfrom the beginning all cases which may be\npart-heard at the time of such transfer. Section 326\nempowers the succeeding Magistrate to pass\nsentence or to proceed with the case from the stage\nit was stopped by his preceding Magistrate. Under\nSection 326(1), the successor Magistrate can act on\nthe evidence recorded by his predecessor either in\nwhole or in part. If he is of the opinion that any\nfurther examination is required, he may recall that\nwitness and examine him, but there is no need of a\nretrial.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">13. In fact, Section 326 deals with part-heard\ncases, when one Magistrate who has partly heard\nthe case is succeeded by another Magistrate either\nbecause the first Magistrate is transferred and is\nsucceeded by another, or because the case is\ntransferred from one Magistrate to another\nMagistrate. The rule mentioned in Section 326 is\nthat the second Magistrate need not rehear the\nwhole case and he can start from the stage the first\nMagistrate left it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">14. However, a bare perusal of sub-section (3) of\nSection 326 makes it more than evident that\nsub-section (1) which authorises the Magistrate who\nsucceeds the Magistrate who had recorded the\nwhole or any part of the evidence in a trial to act on\nthe evidence so recorded by his predecessor, does\nnot apply to summary trials. The prohibition\ncontained in sub-section (3) of Section 326 of the\nCode is absolute and admits of no exception.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">\f                            26</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">Where a Magistrate is transferred from one station\nto another, his jurisdiction ceases in the former\nstation when the transfer takes effect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">15. Provision for summary trials is made in\nChapter XXI of the Code. Section 260 of the Code\nconfers power upon any Chief Judicial Magistrate or\nany Metropolitan Magistrate or any Magistrate of the\nFirst Class specially empowered in this behalf by\nthe High Court to try in a summary way all or any of\nthe offences enumerated therein. Section 262 lays\ndown the procedure for summary trial and\nsub-section (1) thereof inter alia prescribes that in\nsummary trials the procedure specified in the Code\nfor the trial of summons case shall be followed\nsubject to the condition that no sentence of\nimprisonment for a term exceeding three months is\npassed in case of any conviction under the chapter.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">16. The manner in which the record in\nsummary trials is to be maintained is provided\nin Section 263 of the Code. Section 264 mentions\nthat:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">  “264. Judgments in cases tried summarily.\n  —In every case tried summarily in which the\n  accused does not plead guilty, the Magistrate\n  shall record the substance of the evidence\n  and a judgment containing a brief statement of\n  the reasons for the finding.”\n\nThus, the Magistrate is not expected to record\nfull evidence which he would have been,\notherwise required to record in a regular trial\nand his judgment should also contain a brief\nstatement of the reasons for the finding and not\nelaborate reasons which otherwise he would\nhave been required to record in regular trials.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">\f                                   27</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">      17. The mandatory language in which Section\n      326(3) is couched, leaves no manner of doubt that\n      when a case is tried as a summary case a\n      Magistrate, who succeeds the Magistrate who had\n      recorded the part or whole of the evidence, cannot\n      act on the evidence so recorded by his predecessor.\n      In summary proceedings, the successor Judge or\n      Magistrate has no authority to proceed with the trial\n      from a stage at which his predecessor has left it.\n      The reason why the provisions of sub-sections (1)\n      and (2) of Section 326 of the Code have not been\n      made applicable to summary trials is that in\n      summary trials only the substance of evidence has\n      to be recorded. The court does not record the entire\n      statement of witnesses. Therefore, the Judge or the\n      Magistrate who has recorded such substance of\n      evidence is in a position to appreciate the evidence\n      led before him and the successor Judge or\n      Magistrate cannot appreciate the evidence only on\n      the basis of evidence recorded by his predecessor.\n      Section 326(3) of the Code does not permit the\n      Magistrate to act upon the substance of the\n      evidence recorded by his predecessor, the obvious\n      reason being that if the succeeding Judge is\n      permitted to rely upon the substance of the\n      evidence recorded by his predecessor, there\n      will be a serious prejudice to the accused and\n      indeed, it would be difficult for a succeeding\n      Magistrate himself to decide the matter\n      effectively and to do substantial justice .”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">30.   Further considering the memo jointly filed by the parties, it\n\nwas held by this Court that “it is well settled that no amount\n\nof consent by the parties can confer jurisdiction where\n\nthere exists none, on a court of law nor can they divest a\n\ncourt of jurisdiction which it possesses under the law .”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">\f                               28</span>\n\n\nThis <a href=\"/doc/1403861/\" id=\"a_97\">Court further held</a>:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1545331\" id=\"span_32\">“19. The cardinal principle of law in criminal trial is\nthat it is a right of an accused that his case should\nbe decided by a Judge who has heard the whole of\nit. It is so stated by this Court in the decision in\n<a href=\"/doc/1545331/\" id=\"a_98\">Pyare Lal v. State of Punjab</a>, AIR 1962 SC 690.\nThis principle was being rigorously applied prior to\nthe introduction of Section 350 in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_99\">Code of\nCriminal Procedure</a>, 1898. Section 326 of the new\nCode deals with what was intended to be dealt with\nby Section 350 of the old Code.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">20. From the language of Section 326(3) of the\nCode, it is plain that the provisions of Sections\n326(1) and 326(2) of the new Code are not\napplicable to summary trials. Therefore, except in\nregard to those cases which fall within the ambit of\nSection 326 of the Code, the Magistrate cannot\nproceed with the trial placing reliance on the\nevidence recorded by his predecessor. He has got\nto try the case de novo. In this view of the matter,\nthe High Court should have ordered de novo trial.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                    …      …        …\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">22. As it has been seen that Section 326 of the\nnew Code is an exception to the cardinal principle of\ntrial of criminal cases, it is crystal clear that if that\nprinciple is violated by a particular Judge or a\nMagistrate, he would be doing something not being\nempowered by law in that behalf. Therefore, Section\n461 of the new Code would be applicable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">23. Section 461 of the new Code narrates the\nirregularities which vitiate proceedings. The relevant\nprovision is clause (l). It reads as follows:\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">\f                                   29</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">        “461.      Irregularities     which   vitiate\n        proceedings.—If any Magistrate, not being\n        empowered by law in this behalf, does any of\n        the following things, namely:\n</blockquote>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">                            * *         *\n        (l) tries an offender;\n\n                           * *          *\n\n        his proceedings shall be void.”\n\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">      A plain reading of this provision shows that the\n      proceedings held by a Magistrate, to the extent that\n      he is not empowered by law, would be void and void\n      proceedings cannot be validated under Section 465\n      of the Code. This defect is not a mere irregularity\n      and the conviction of the appellants cannot, even if\n      sustainable on the evidence, be upheld under\n      Section 465 of the Code.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">                         …     …        …\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">      25. This is not a case of irregularity but want of\n      competency. Apart from Sections 326(1) and 326(2)\n      which are not applicable to the present case in view\n      of Section 326(3), the Code does not conceive of\n      such a trial. Therefore, Section 465 of the Code has\n      no application. It cannot be called in aid to make\n      what was incompetent, competent. There has been\n      no proper trial of the case and there should be one.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">31.   In Nitinbhai we find that the entire case was tried\n\n‘summarily’ and the Magistrate who issued process, was\n\ntransferred after recording the evidence. The succeeding\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">\f                                    30</span>\n\n\nMagistrate delivered the judgment basing upon the memo filed\n\nby the parties declaring that they had no objection to proceed\n\nwith the matter on the basis of evidence recorded by his\n\npredecessor. Ultimately, this Court remanded the matter to the\n\nTrial Court for de novo trial opining that no amount of consent\n\nby the parties can confer jurisdiction on a Court of law, where\n\nthere exists none, nor can they divest a Court of jurisdiction\n\nwhich it possesses under the law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">32.   Coming to the facts of the present cases, on scrutiny of\n\nrecord available in SLP(Crl) No. 5623 of 2012, we found that\n\nthere has been in total 82 hearings spread over five years. Out\n\nof 82 hearings, 67 hearings were done by Jt. C.J. (J.D.) and\n\nJ.M.F.C.,   Veraval.   The   Magistrate   was   transferred   on\n\n24.02.2005 and was replaced by J.M.F.C., Veraval who heard\n\nthe case for 14 more times and delivered judgment on 15 th\n\nhearing i.e. on 12.09.2005. Thus by any stretch of imagination,\n\nthe trial which extended over five years and was decided in\n\nover 82 hearings with elaborate cross examination, deposition\n\nand all trappings of regular trial cannot simply be termed as\n\n“summary trial”.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">\f                                   31</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">33.   On perusal of record of other two cases (SLP (Crl.) Nos.\n\n3332 of 2012 and 734 of 2013), we found the similar situation.\n\nThe Complaint was taken up on 20 th August, 2001 and the Trial\n\nCourt decided the criminal case on 30th May, 2009 declaring the\n\naccused appellants as innocent, after conducting about 132\n\nhearings. It is also evident from the record that in SLP(Crl) No.\n\n734 of 2013, the criminal proceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_100\">N.I. Act</a> were\n\ninitiated in December, 1998 before the Trial Court which came\n\nto be concluded by the judgment of the Metropolitan Magistrate\n\non 7th August, 2009. Thus, during the period of about 11 years a\n\ntotal of 103 hearings took place and a detailed trial procedure\n\nhad been followed. Going thereby, prima facie, it is difficult for\n\nus to accept that the case was tried summarily.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">34.   Moreover, these cases were decided by the same judge\n\nin the High Court and there seems to be a mechanical\n\napplication of Nitinbhai without discerning the difference on\n\nfacts of Nithinbhai and the present cases. In Nitinbhai, the\n\ncase was established as being decided ‘summarily’ whereas in\n\nthe present cases, no such independent inquiry has been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                  32</span>\n\n\nundertaken by the High Court to arrive at a just conclusion\n\nwhether the cases were tried “summarily” or in a “regular way”.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">35.   Be that as it may, to satisfy ourselves we have carefully\n\ngone through the records of the Trial Court as well as the High\n\nCourt in each matter before us. There is no doubt, as per the\n\nrecord, learned Magistrate has not specifically mentioned that\n\nthe trial was conducted as summons case or summary case.\n\nThough in the record of SLP(Crl) No. 734 of 2013, at some\n\nplaces the word ‘summary’ was mentioned as regards to the\n\nnature of proceedings of the case, having given our anxious\n\nand thorough consideration, we found that the word ‘summary’\n\nused therein was with reference to Chapter XXII of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_101\">Cr.P.C</a>.,\n\n1882 and it does not relate to the ‘summary trial’ envisaged\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 143</a>, of the N.I. Act. Pertinently, before the Trial\n\nCourt the Suit No. 4457 of 2001 has been referred at some\n\nplaces as ‘Summary Suit’ and at some other places it has been\n\nreferred as ‘Civil Suit’. Similarly, the case number 5294 of 1998\n\nhas been shown at some places as Summary Case and at\n\nsome other places it was shown as Criminal Case. After a\n\ncareful examination of the record, we came to the conclusion\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                                  33</span>\n\n\nthat the word ‘summary’ used at some places was with\n\nreference to summary trials prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_103\">Cr.P.C</a>. Needless\n\nto say that the summary trial as preferred mode of trial in the\n\nmatters related to negotiable instruments was inserted by the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1210757/\" id=\"a_104\">Amendment Act, 2002</a> only w.e.f. 6th February, 2003.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">36.   Thus the scrutiny of the record of the Courts below led us\n\nto the opinion that the High Court has not applied its mind\n\nindependently by thoroughly examining the records about the\n\nprocedure followed in these cases by the Magistrate.         The\n\nrecord shows that the Complaint was lodged on 19 th August,\n\n2000 and presented in the Court of learned Magistrate on 6 th\n\nSeptember, 2000 when the trial proceedings were commenced\n\nwhich came to be concluded only on 29 th August, 2005, after a\n\nlong lapse of about six years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">37.   A case under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_105\">section 138</a> of the N.I. Act, which requires to\n\nbe tried in a summary way as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_106\">section 143</a>\n\nof the Act, when in fact, was tried as regular summons case it\n\nwould not come within the purview of section 326 (3) of the\n\nCode. In other words, if the case in substance was not tried in\n\na summary way, though was triable summarily, and was tried as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                 34</span>\n\n\na summons case, it need not be heard de novo and the\n\nsucceeding Magistrate can follow the procedure contemplated\n\nunder section 326 (1) of the Code [See Ramilaben Trikamlal\n\nShah vs. Tube and Allied Products &amp; Ors. 2007 ALLMR (Cri)\n\n1637 (Bom)].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1595081\" id=\"span_39\">38.   But where even in a case that can be tried summarily, the\n\nCourt records the evidence elaborately and in verbatim and\n\ndefence was given full scope to cross-examine, such procedure\n\nadopted is indicative that it was not summary procedure and\n\ntherefore, succeeding Magistrate can rely upon the evidence on\n\nrecord and de novo enquiry need not be conducted [See <a href=\"/doc/1595081/\" id=\"a_107\">A.\n\nKrishna Reddy vs. State &amp; Anr.</a> 1999 (6) ALD 279].</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">39.   In Bhaskar @ Prabaskar &amp; Ors. Vs.

The archaic concept was that the very same\n      judicial personage who heard and recorded the\n      evidence must decide the case. That concept was\n      in vogue for a long time. But over the years it was\n      revealed in practice that fossilisation of the said\n      concept, instead of fostering the administration of\n      criminal justice, was doing the reverse. Very\n      occasionally judicial officer of one court was\n      changed and was replaced by another. As evidence\n      had to be recorded afresh by the new officer under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                              35</span>\n\n\nthe old system, witnesses who were already\nexamined in the cases at the cost of considerable\nstrain and expenses - not only to them but to the\nexchequer - were re-summoned and re-examined.\nThe litigation cost thereby inflicted on the parties\nused to soar up. The process would have to be\nrepeated over again if such next judicial personage\nalso was changed. Eventually it was learnt that the\nobject sought to be achieved by such repetitions,\nwhen compared with the enormous cost and\ntrouble, was not of much utility. Hence the\nlegislature wanted to discontinue the aforesaid\nante-diluvian practice and decided to afford option\nto the successor judicial officer. Legislature\nconferred such option only to the magistrates at the\nfirst instance and at the same lime empowered\nthem to re-examine the witnesses already examined\nif they considered such a course necessary for the\ninterest of justice. As the new experiment showed\npositive results towards fostering the cause of\ncriminal justice the Law Commission recommended\nthat such option should advisedly be extended to\njudges of all other trial courts also.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                    …     …        …\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">21. A contrary interpretation would lead to\nunwholesome repetition of the entire exercise\ninvolving considerable cost to the exchequer,\nfinancial strain to the accused and waste of time of\nthe courts. Greater than all those, it would inflict\nuntold inconveniences to the witnesses who are the\ninnocent parties in (sic) case. The Court cannot\nafford to be oblivious to the reality that no witness\nis, on his own volition, desirous of going to the Court\nfor remaining there until his turn is called to mount\nthe witness stand and to undergo the agony of\nfacing grueling questions. He does it as he has no\nother option when summoned by the Court. Most of\nthe witnesses can attend the courts only by bearing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">\f                                  36</span>\n\n\n      with all the inconveniences to themselves and at the\n      cost of loss of their valuable time. When any\n      witness had already undergone such agony once in\n      connection with the same case, no effort to save\n      him from undergoing that agony once again for the\n      very same case should be spared, unless such\n      re-summoning is absolutely necessary to meet the\n      ends of justice.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">40.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1082807\" id=\"span_42\">In <a href=\"/doc/1082807/\" id=\"a_108\">Shivaji Sampat Jagtap Vs.

Out of three cases\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">\f                                    38</span>\n\n\nbefore us, in SLP (Crl.)

No. 3332/2012 there is finding on record that the\n\ncases have been heard by one Magistrate and judgment was\n\npassed by another Magistrate, they were remanded back to\n\nTrial Court for de novo trial even without inquiry whether they\n\nwere tried summarily or regularly. It seems from the impugned\n\norders that no thorough scrutiny was undertaken by the High\n\nCourt concerned to ascertain whether cases have been actually\n\ntried summarily or as summons cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">44.

The High Court in the present cases remanded the\n\nmatters for de novo trial on the basis of flawed application of\n\nNitinbhai’s case, in spite of the fact that these cases are\n\npending for over a decade. It went unnoticed by the High Court\n\nthat the appellants have raised the plea of mode of trial due to\n\nchange of Magistrate for the first time before the High Court.\n\nThe same has not been raised when the change of Magistrate\n\ntook place in the Court below during the course of trial. This\n\nclearly shows that only for the purpose of protracting the\n\nlitigation, the plea has been taken for the first time. Had it been\n\ntheir case that because of the procedure adopted by the Court\n\nsubstantial miscarriage has taken place, they would have\n\nraised this plea at a much early stage of the proceedings.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">49.   &#x27;Speedy trial&#x27; and &#x27;fair trial&#x27; to a person accused of a crime\n\nare integral part of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution of India. There\n\nis, however, qualitative difference between the right to speedy\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">\f                                      41</span>\n\n\ntrial and the accused&#x27;s right of fair trial. Unlike the accused&#x27;s\n\nright of fair trial, deprivation of the right to speedy trial does not\n\nper se prejudice the accused in defending himself. The right to\n\nspeedy trial is in its very nature relative. It depends upon\n\ndiverse circumstances. Each case of delay in conclusion of a\n\ncriminal trial has to be seen in the facts and circumstances of\n\nsuch   case.    Mere     lapse   of    several   years    since   the\n\ncommencement of prosecution by itself may not justify the\n\ndiscontinuance of prosecution or dismissal of indictment. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"185913157\" id=\"span_56\">The\n\nfactors concerning the accused&#x27;s right to speedy trial have to be\n\nweighed vis-a-vis the impact of the crime on society and the\n\nconfidence of the people in judicial system. Speedy trial\n\nsecures rights to an accused but it does not preclude the rights\n\nof public justice. The nature and gravity of crime, persons\n\ninvolved, social impact and societal needs must be weighed\n\nalong with the right of the accused to speedy trial and if the\n\nbalance tilts in favour of the former the long delay in conclusion\n\nof criminal trial should not operate against the continuation of\n\nprosecution and if the right of accused in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case and exigencies of situation tilts the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">\f                                   42</span>\n\n\nbalance in his favour, the prosecution may be brought to an\n\nend.

It is worthwhile to mention that in one of the present\n\ncases, the Trial Court took about six years to acquit the\n\naccused and then High Court took about six and half years to\n\nremit the matter to the Trial Court on a technical ground of\n\nmode of trial i.e. being summary trial. Special Leave Petition\n\nagainst the order of High Court has been filed on 28 th April,\n\n2012. Thus, about 14 years have elapsed, without definitive\n\ndeterminative conclusion of the case on merits. Thus, the whole\n\npurport   of   expeditious   trial   under   <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_135\">N.I.   Act</a>   has   been\n\npreposterously frustrated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">57.   Thus, we are of the considered opinion that the Courts\n\nwhile dealing with the matters under the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_136\">N.I. Act</a> should keep in\n\nmind that the difference between summary and summons trial\n\nfor the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_137\">N.I. Act</a> is very subtle but has grave\n\nrepercussions in case of mistaken identification of trial which is\n\nde novo trial in the light of Sec 326 (3) of the Code.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">\f                                   46</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">58.   A de novo trial should be the last resort and that too only\n\nwhen such a course becomes so desperately indispensable. It\n\nshould be limited to the extreme exigency to avert “a failure of\n\njustice”. Any omission or even the illegality in the procedure\n\nwhich does not affect the core of the case is not a ground for\n\nordering a de novo trial. This is because the appellate Court\n\nhas got the plenary powers to revaluate and reappraise the\n\nevidence and to take additional evidence on record or to direct\n\nsuch additional evidence to be collected by the Trial Court. But\n\nto replay the whole laborious exercise after erasing the bulky\n\nrecords relating to the earlier proceedings by bringing down all\n\nthe persons to the Court once again for repeating the whole\n\ndepositions would be a sheer waste of time, energy and costs\n\nunless there is miscarriage of justice otherwise. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"954891\" id=\"span_69\">Hence the said\n\ncourse can be resorted to when it becomes imperative for the\n\npurpose of averting “failure of justice”. The superior Court which\n\norders a de novo trial cannot afford to overlook the realities and\n\nthe serious impact on the pending cases in trial courts which\n\nare crammed with dockets, and how much that order would\n\ninflict hardship on many innocent persons who once took all the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">\f                                   47</span>\n\n\ntrouble to reach the Court and deposed their versions in the\n\nvery same case. The re-enactment of the whole labour might\n\ngive the impression to the litigant and the common man that law\n\nis more pedantic than pragmatic. Law is not an instrument to be\n\nused for inflicting sufferings on the people but for the process of\n\njustice dispensation [See <a href=\"/doc/954891/\" id=\"a_138\">State of M.P. Vs.

Thus, in summation, we are of the considered opinion that\n\nthe exercise of remitting the matter to Trial Court for de novo\n\ntrial should be done only when the appellate Court is satisfied\n\nafter thorough scrutiny of records and then recording reason for\n\nthe same that the trial is not summons trial but summary trial.\n\nThe non-exhaustive list which may indicate the difference\n\nbetween both modes of trial is framing of charges, recording of\n\nstatement under sec 313 of the Code, whether trial has been\n\ndone in the manner prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_139\">Sections 262-265</a> of\n\nCr.P.C, how elaborately evidence has been adduced and taken\n\non record, the length of trial etc. In summary trial, the accused\n\nis summoned, his plea is recorded under sec 263 (g) of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_140\">Cr.P.C</a>.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">\f                                   48</span>\n\n\nand finding thereof is given by the Magistrate under <a href=\"/doc/167317/\" id=\"a_141\">Section\n\n263 (h)</a> of Cr.P.C. of his examination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_81\">60.     The ratio in Nitinbhai must not be followed mechanically\n\nto remand matters to trial courts for de novo trial. There should\n\nbe proper application of judicial mind and evidence on record\n\nmust be thoroughly perused before arriving at any conclusion\n\nwith regard to mode of trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">61.     However, to summarise and answer the issues raised\n\nherein, following directions are issued for the Courts seized off\n\nwith similar cases:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">   1.     All the subordinate Courts must make an endeavour to\n          expedite the hearing of cases in a time bound manner\n          which in turn will restore the confidence of the common\n          man in the justice delivery system. When law expects\n          something to be done within prescribed time limit,\n          some efforts are required to be made to obey the\n          mandate of law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">   2.     The learned Magistrate has the discretion under\n          <a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 143</a> of the N.I. Act either to follow a summary\n          trial or summons trial. In case the Magistrate wants to\n          conduct a summons trial, he should record the reasons\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">\f                                 49</span>\n\n\n     after hearing the parties and proceed with the trial in\n     the manner provided under the second proviso to\n     <a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 143</a> of the N.I. Act. Such reasons should\n     necessarily be recorded by the Trial Court so that\n     further litigation arraigning the mode of trial can be\n     avoided.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">3.   The learned Judicial Magistrate should make all\n     possible attempts to encourage compounding of\n     offence at an early stage of litigation. In a prosecution\n     under      the   <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_144\">Negotiable      Instruments   Act</a>,   the\n     compensatory aspect of remedy must be given priority\n     over the punitive aspect.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">4.   All the subordinate Courts should follow the directives\n     of the Supreme Court issued in several cases\n     scrupulously for effective conduct of trials and speedy\n     disposal of cases.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">5.   Remitting the matter for de novo trial should be\n     exercised as a last resort and should be used sparingly\n     when there is grave miscarriage of justice in the light of\n     illegality, irregularity, incompetence or any other defect\n     which cannot be cured at an appellate stage. The\n     appellate Court should be very cautious and exercise\n     the discretion judiciously while remanding the matter\n     for de novo trial.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">\f                                    50</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">  6.      While examining the nature of the trial conducted by\n          the Trial Court for the purpose of determining whether\n          it was summary trial or summons trial, the primary and\n          predominant test to be adopted by the appellate Court\n          should be whether it was only the substance of the\n          evidence that was recorded or whether the complete\n          record of the deposition of the witness in their chief\n          examination, cross examination and re-examination in\n          verbatim was faithfully placed on record. The appellate\n          Court has to go through each and every minute detail\n          of the Trial Court record and then examine the same\n          independently and thoroughly to reach at a just and\n          reasonable conclusion.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">62.    We, therefore, direct all the Criminal Courts in the country\n\ndealing with cases falling under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act to\n\nfollow the above-mentioned procedure discussed in the\n\npreceding paragraphs for speedy and expeditious disposal of\n\ncases as per the purport of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">63.    In the light of the discussion made above, we are of the\n\nconsidered opinion that the High Court failed to appreciate the\n\nevidence on record in its true perspective. The High Court erred\n\nin arriving at a conclusion that the mode of trial in all these\n\nmatters was summary trial whereas the record of the trial Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">\f                                51</span>\n\n\nadequately shows that regular trial was undertaken in these\n\nmatters. Hence, in our considered opinion, the matters are\n\nrequired to be remanded back to the High Court for\n\nconsideration on merits. We make it clear, that we have not\n\nexpressed any opinion on the merits of the cases. The High\n\nCourt should, by conducting an independent inquiry and by\n\nreasoned order, dispose of the cases on their own merits as\n\nexpeditiously as possible, preferably within a period of three\n\nmonths due to the fact that these cases are languishing for\n\nalmost 14 years.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">64.   For the foregoing reasons, we allow the appeals, set\n\naside the impugned judgments passed by the High Court and\n\nremand the matters to the High Court for consideration on\n\nmerits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">                               ………………………………….J.\n                              (RANJANA PRAKASH DESAI)\n\n\n\n                               …………………………………J.\n                               (N.V.
