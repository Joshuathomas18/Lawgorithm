Accordingly\t submissions  on   behalf  of\tsuch\nappellants were also more or less on similar terms.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">     The impugned  judgments of the High Court reversing the\norders of  acquittal and  convicting the appellants in these\nappeals have  been assailed  by the  learned counsel for the\nappellants by  contending that\talthough an  appellate Court\nhas jurisdiction  to interfere\twith the finding of fact and\nreverse such  finding on  proper  appreciation\tof  evidence\nadduced in the trial, as a rule of prudence, court of appeal\nshould not  interfere with  the order  of acquittal  are not\nperverse of against the weight of the evidence addced in the\ncase and  the basis  of judgment  is founded  on a reasoning\nwhich can  not be held to be one of the possible views which\nmay be\treasoning which\t can not  be held  to be  one of the\npossible views\twhich may  be reasonably taken by the Court.\nThe learned  counsel have  submitted that  the guidelines or\nthe principles\tjustifying  interference  by  the  Court  of\nappeal against\tan order of acquittal have been well settled\nby a number of decisions of this Court indicating that rules\nof prudence  dictate that  unless a  very  strong  case\t for\ninterference against  a well  reasoned order of acquittal is\nmade out,  the court  of appeal will refrain from making its\nown assessment\tof  the\t evidence  for\ttaking\tone  of\t the\npossible views,\t different from\t the view taken by the trial\ncourt. It  has been  submitted that  although High Court has\nrightly pointed\t out the  principles justifying interference\nagainst the  order of  acquittal it failed to appreciate the\nfacts and  circumstances of  the  cases\t and  the  evidences\nadduced in  the trial  and has reversed the decisions of the\ntrial court  cotrary  to  the  well  established  principles\njustifying such\t interference. The contention of the learned\ncounsel appearing  for the appellants in Criminal Appeal No.\n310 of 1989 are to the following effect:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     (a) The  High Court  in  this  case  has\n     totally ignored the reasons given by the\n     Trial Court  and totally  overlooked the\n     several   admissions    made   by\t  the\n     prosecution witnesses  in\ttheir  Cross-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">     examination which\twholly demolisnes the\n     value of  their evidence in examination-\n     in-chief.

The\n     High Court, sitting in appeal, ought not\n     to have  reversed the  acquittal without\n     displacing the  findings  of  the\tTrial\n     Court merely  because a  different\t view\n     was also  possible. The  High Court  has\n     nowhere considered how the officers, A-2\n     and  A-3,\t could\tbe   held  guilty  of\n     conspiracy without a categorical finding\n     that no  fertilizer was  received by the\n     AAD (A-3).\t It has\t not adverted  to the\n     admissions\t made\tby  the\t  prosecution\n     witnesses\tin  their  cross  examination\n     which were\t referred  to  by  the\tTrial\n     Court for acquitting them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">     (c) The  High Court has failed to notice\n     that  not\t a  single   witness  of  the\n     prosecution has stated that there was no\n     stock of  fertilizers on the day when it\n     was recorded in the stock register by A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">     3.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">     (d) The  High Court  failed to  see that\n     upto  the\t date  of   issuance  of  the\n     impugned  certificates,   there  was  no\n     obligation to  verify  the\t registration\n     numbers  of  the  trucks  in  which  the\n     fertilizers were transported.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">     (e) The  High Court  failed to  consider\n     that the  District Agricultural  Officer\n     in\t Nandiyal   which   is\t in   Kurnool\n     District, has  neither jurisdiction  nor\n     the  staff\t  to   monitor\t each\tlorry\n     transporting  fertilizers\t lifted\t from\n     Kakinada port  which is  five  districts\n     away at  a distance  of nearly  600 kms.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">     from his  place of posting. He (A-2,DAO)\n     was to take the certificate given by A-3\n     (AAO) and\tissue a certificate verifying\n     the distance  and reasonableness of Rate\n     after verifying  the stock which he did.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">     There is no evidence to the contrary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">     (f) The  High Court has erred in nothing\n     the DAO&#x27;s (A-2) contention. It was never\n     argued for A-2 that he had no obligation\n     to verify the stock.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">     (g) The High Court failed to notice that\n     there is  an entry in the stock register\n     of\t  the\trespective   stock   on\t  the\n     particular day  and A-(3) (AAO) gave the\n     certificate.   Prosecution\t   has\t  not\n     examined any witness even to say that no\n     truck  came   and\tno   fertilizer\t  was\n     delivered to A-2 on that day.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">     (h) No  witness was  examined  to\tprove\n     that on  the day the entry was made, any\n     inspection was  done either  on that day\n     or within\ta reasonable  time thereafter\n     to hold  that no  stock was received and\n     certificate given\tby A-2\tand  A-3  are\n     false.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">     (i) No witness was examined to show that\n     attempt was  made to  ascertain  if  any\n     stock     was\tin     the     godown\n     contemporaneously with  the date  of the\n     entry  in\tthe  stock  Register  or  the\n     issuance of  the  certificate;  nor  was\n     there any\tspecific  complaint  to\t this\n     effect.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">     No one  was examined to prove that there\n     was no stock on the relevant date.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">     (j) The  High Court  totally ignored the\n     evidence  of   PWs.  13   and   15\t  who\n     categorically  stated  that  fertilizers\n     were  freely  available  in  the  market\n     which fact\t was specifically referred to\n     and relied\t upon by  the Trial  Court to\n     acquit the\t appellant. With  the limited\n     jurisdiction of  A-2 and  A-3 they could\n     only verify  the stock  brought to\t them\n     and enter\tin the\tstock register.\t They\n     had no  machinery to  verify whether  it\n     was the self same stock which was lifted\n     by\t A-1  from  Kakinada  or  some\tother\n     stock. For that purpose A-2 was required\n     only  to\tverify\tthe   port  documents\n     showing lifting  at this port. It is the\n     admitted case of prosecution that Dealer\n     A-1 did  lift fertilizer  from Kakinada.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">     Hence some\t fertilizer was\t delivered to\n     A-2. Even\tif it  was not\tthe same, A-2\n     and  A-3\twere  bound   to  issue\t  the\n     certificates. Hence  they cannot be held\n     guilty.  There   is  no   evidence\t that\n     fertilizer was  not  delivered  at\t all.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">     When fertilisers  were freely  available\n     the dealers  could\t even  after  selling\n     away fertilizers  lifted at  port\tcould\n     very  well\t have  purchased  fertilizers\n     locally and  delivered it to A-2. Unless\n     this   hypothesis,\t  which\t  is   highly\n     probable\tis   excluded\tby   positive\n     evidence A-2  and A-3  cannot  be\tfound\n     guilty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">     (k) The  trial court  further held\t that\n     the alleged  sales by  dealer  (A-1)  at\n     Bubbili and Sompeta was not established.\n     The  trial\t Court\talso  held  that  the\n     identify of  the fertilisers sold is not\n     established.  In  the  absence  of\t such\n     evidence, the  trial  court  refused  to\n     believe that  the fertilisers  were  not\n     transported from  Kakinada to  Allagadda\n     in Kurnool\t District. Dealing  with this\n     aspect, the High Court has observed that\n     the  partner   of\tthe   shop  has\t been\n     examined and  in some  cases  clerk  has\n     been examined  and accounts in which the\n     sale transactions are entered are proved\n     and hence\tsale by\t A-1  is  proved.  In\n     coming  to\t that  conclusion,  the\t High\n     Court failed to notice that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     i) day  books were\t not filed  and\t only\n     ledgers were filed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">     ii) In  the ledgers there is no entry of\n     A-1 selling the fertilisers.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">     iii) There\t is also no entry to identify\n     the fertilisers  sold, nor\t even that it\n     was imported  fertiliser taken  delivery\n     of at  Kakinada by\t A-1. The day book in\n     which such entries are said to have been\n     made was not produced.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     iv)  That\tthe  registration  number  of\n     trucks were  not entered  in the  ledger\n     and are said to have been entered in the\n     day book  but  that  day  book  was  not\n     produced.\t The\twitnesses    examined\n     admitted that they did not travel in the\n     trucks which transported the fertilisers\n     purchased by them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">     v) The drivers were not examined.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">     vi) The  trip sheets  of the trucks were\n     not filed. A few filed are loose sheets.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">     Witnesses admitted\t that they  were  not\n     maintained for  all trips.\t Refering  to\n     the decision  in State  of Kerala versus\n     Thomas Alias  Boby (1986 (2) SCC 411) it\n     was contended  that trip sheets were not\n     worthy of\tcredence because loose sheets\n     properly maintained  and kept not in any\n     book form, have no evidentiary value. No\n     liability can be imposed on the basis of\n     mere entry in the account books and such\n     trip sheets.  All these facts were taken\n     note of  by the  trial court  in holding\n     the sales not proved.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">     vii) The  High Court  in  reversing  the\n     findings  has   only  made\t  a   general\n     reference to the examination-in-chief of\n     those witnesses  and wholly  ignored the\n     damaging admissions  made by each one of\n     the witnesses in cross-examination.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">     viii) The\tHigh Court  has only  pointed\n     out that  partners\t of  the  firm\twhich\n     purchased\tfertilisers   were  competent\n     witnesses to  identify the\t signature of\n     the clerks\t who made these entries. That\n     by\t itself\t  does\tnot   establish\t  the\n     identity of  the fertilisers lifted from\n     Kakinada port nor does it establish that\n     A-1 had sold those fertilisers.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">     ix) The  High Court  has placed reliance\n     on entries\t at the check posts. Judicial\n     notice of\tthe fact  could be taken note\n     of that  for several  trucks  moving  on\n     road there\t are no\t entries in the check\n     post regions. When these fertilisers are\n     admittedly not  liable for sales tax. If\n     no\t entries   are\tmade,\tno  inference\n     adverse to the accused could be drawn.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">     1)\t The   ingredients  of\tthe  offences\n     charged against  the appellants have not\n     been  established\t for  the   following\n     reasons:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">     a) A-2  and A-3  are  charged  with  the\n     offence of\t giving\t false\tcertificates.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">     For bringing  home the  charge of\t120-B\n     read with\t420 against  A-2 and A-3, the\n     prosecution in  this case must establish\n     that they\thad  conspired\twith  A-1  to\n     cheat. There  is no  direct evidence  on\n     this  aspect.   Of\t course,  it  can  be\n     established by  circumstantial evidence.\n     The most  essential  ingredient  of  the\n     offence of\t cheating  is  deceiving  any\n     person  and   inducing  that  person  to\n     deliver any property. In this case there\n     is\t no   proof  of\t  non\tdelivery   of\n     fertiliser. The certificate issued by A-\n     2 and  A-3, could\tbe said\t to be\tfalse\n     only if no fertiliser was received by A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">     3 and  yet\t A-3  entered  in  the\tstock\n     register  and  issued  the\t certificate.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">     There is  no finding  of the  High Court\n     that the  stock of\t fertilisers was  not\n     received. It  may be noted that there is\n     no duty  cast upon A-3 to certify that a\n     particular type  of fertiliser  has been\n     received or imported fertiliser has been\n     received or  the very  same stock lifted\n     from Kakinada  port was received by him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">     A-3 was  only to certify the quantity of\n     fertiliser received.  It was  not within\n     the  power\t  of  A-3   to\tmonitor\t  the\n     transport all  the way  from Kakinada to\n     Allagadda over  a distance\t of 600\t kms.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">     His jurisdiction  is limited  to one  of\n     the  several  talukas  of\tthe  district\n     while   the   fertiliser\twas   to   be\n     transported  over\t 5  districts.\t When\n     fertiliser was  freely available  in the\n     market, it\t may very  well be  that  A-1\n     disposed of  the fertiliser  lifted from\n     Kakinada at  Kakinada or  at  any\tother\n     place    nearby,\t  purchased\tother\n     fertilisers  freely   available  in  the\n     market and\t delivered to A-3 and A-3 who\n     having received  the same entered in the\n     stock   register\t and\tissued\t  the\n     certificate. The  certificate so  issued\n     could not\tbe said\t to be false or given\n     to\t  deceive   anyone   unless   it   is\n     established that  no fertiliser  at  all\n     was received  on the  particular  day  a\n     certificate issued\t cannot be said to be\n     false. There  is no such evidence; hence\n     A-3 cannot be held guilty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_33\">     b)\t  A-2,\t  DAO,\t issued\t  certificate\n     certifying the distance from Kakinada to\n     Allagadda and  the reasonable rate which\n     could be  paid per ton of fertiliser per\n     km.  It   is  not\t the  case   of\t  the\n     prosecution  that\t the  certificate  of\n     distance and  reasonable price  is false\n     or\t untrue.   The\tcase   is  that\t  the\n     fertilisers were  not transported at all\n     and that  no fertiliser  was reversed on\n     the day when it was entered in the stock\n     register.\t A-3\twas   to   give\t  the\n     certificate certifying  the distance and\n     the rate  for transport  after verifying\n     the   stock    after    obtaining\t  the\n     certificate  issued   by  A-3.   If  the\n     certificate issued\t by A-3 is not false,\n     as submitted  above, when\tthere  is  no\n     evidence that  DAO A-2  has not verified\n     the  stock,  A-2  also  cannot  be\t held\n     guilty.  Even   assuming  that  A-1  has\n     disposed of  the fertiliser  lifted from\n     Kakinada at  any other place and did not\n     actually transport\t it to\tAllagadda, so\n     long as  it is  not established  that on\n     the day  when the\tentry is  made in the\n     stock  register,\tthere  was  no\tstock\n     received by  A-3 neither A-2 nor A-3 can\n     be\t held  guilty.\tThe  prosecution  has\n     failed to\tprove positively  that\tthere\n     was no fertiliser on the relevant date.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">\t  The prosecution  however wants  the\n     court to  draw an\tinference against the\n     accused  on  the  evidence\t of  sale  of\n     certain fertilisers  by A-1  the dealer,\n     at some  other place.  There is no basis\n     for such  an inference  especially\t when\n     plenty  of\t  fertilisers\twere   freely\n     available in  the market  and even after\n     disposing\tof   the  fertilisers\tat  a\n     different place,  the dealer (A-1) could\n     have  purchased   fertiliser  from\t  the\n     nearby market  and delivered the same to\n     A-3. A  certificate  issued  by  A-3  on\n     receiving\tsuch  fertilisers  cannot  be\n     said to be falsely issued with an intent\n     to\t deceive  the  government  to  secure\n     benefit for  A-1.\tA-2  also  could  not\n     therefore be found guilty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">\t  The prosecution, however, says that\n     in\t the   circumstances  only   negative\n     evidence\tcould\t be   adduced\t that\n     fertiliser were  disposed\tof  elsewhere\n     and positive  evidence of fertiliser not\n     having been  delivered on\tthe  relevant\n     date to  A-3, could not be adduced.

The\tlearned\t counsel   for\tthe  appellants\t has\ncontended that\tsuch contention being against all cannons of\ncriminal jurisorudence\tshould not have been accepted by the\nCourt. It was the unfailing obligation of the prosecution to\nlead convincing\t and unimpeachable  evidence  to  prove\t the\ncharges\t levelled   against  the  accused.  Failure  of\t the\nprosecution  to\t  establish  such   charge  for\t any  reason\nwhatsoever cannot  but ensure  to the benefit of the accused\nparticularly when  the delay  in investigating\tthe case and\nfiling chargesheet was not attributable to the accused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">     It has  also been\tcontended that\tthe  conviction\t was\nsought to  be based  on\t circumstantial\t evidence  are\twell\nsettled by  decisions of  this Court  in a  catina of cases.\nReferring to  the decision  made by  this Court in Janar Lal\nDas versus  State of  Orissa (1991  (3) SCC 27), the learned\ncounsel has  submitted that this court has indicated that in\norder to  sustain  conviction  on  circumstantial  evidence,\nthree conditions must be fulfilled namely;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">     (i)  the  circumstances  from  which  an\n     inference\tof  guilt  is  sought  to  be\n     drawn,  must   be\tcogently  and  firmly\n     established.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_44\">     (ii)  those   circumstances  should   be\n     definite unerringly pointing towards the\n     guilt of the accused:\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_45\">     (iii)    the     circumstances,\ttaken\n     cumulatively, should  from\t a  chain  so\n     complete that  there is  no escape\t from\n     the conclusion  that  within  all\thuman\n     probability the  crime was\t committed by\n     the accused and none else, and it should\n     also be  incapable of explanation on any\n     other hypothesis  than that of the guilt\n     of the accused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">     In\t  cases\t   depending   largely\t upon\n     circumstantial evidence  there is always\n     a danger  that conjecture\tor  suspicion\n     may take  the place  of legal proof. The\n     Court must\t satisfy itself\t that various\n     circumstanced in  the chain  of evidence\n     should be\testablished clearly  and that\n     the completed  chain must\tbe such as to\n     rule out  a reasonable likelihood of the\n     innocence of  the accused. When the main\n     link goes,\t the chain  of\tcircumstances\n     gets  snapped  and\t other\tcircumstances\n     cannot in any manner establish the guilt\n     of the  accused  beyond  all  reasonable\n     doubts. It is at this juncture the court\n     has to  be watchful and avoid the danger\n     of allowing  the suspicion\t to take  the\n     place  of\t legal\tproof  for  sometimes\n     unconsciously it  may  happen  to\tbe  a\n     short step\t between moral\tcertainty and\n     legal proof.  At times  it can be a case\n     of `may  be true&#x27;.\t But there  is a long\n     mental distance  between `may  be\ttrue&#x27;\n     and `must\tbe true&#x27; and the same divides\n     conjectures from sure conclusions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_47\">       It has been contended that there is no convincing and\nunimpeachable evidence\twhich unerringly  points out  to the\nguilt of  the accused  and in  the facts  of  the  case,  no\nconclusion other  than complicity  of the  accused  for\t the\noffence charged,  is  possible.\t Hence,\t conviction  of\t the\nappellant on  proobability, surmise  or conjecture  was\t not\nwarranted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">The learned counsel for the appellant has submitted that the\nappellants had no special knowledge as to whatroute had been\nactually followed  by the  dealer or transporter in bringing\nthe fertilisers to government godown. The appellants had the\nduty to\t certify shortest route between the point of lifting\nand point  of delivery\tand certify  reasonable rate  on the\nbasis of such shortest route.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_49\">It has\tbeen contended\tthat the appellants being government\nofficers responsible at the receiving point were required to\nensure\tthat  fertilisers  had\tin  fact  delivered  at\t the\nreceiving  point.   On\treceiving   the\t  fertilisers,\t the\nappellants have\t discharged their  duties in  certifying the\nreceipt\t of  fertilisers.  Nobody  had\tverified  the  stock\nreceived at the godown on the day of delivery or even within\na reasonable  time. If\ta dealer  or transporter disposes of\nfertilisers lifted  at\tport  on  route\t and  brings  a\t new\nconsignment  of\t  fertiliser  by  procuring  elsewhere,\t the\ngovernment officers at the receiving and had nothing to do.\nIf  on\t receipt  of   the  fertilisers\t  delivered  at\t the\ndestination,  such  officers  had  issued  certificates,  no\noffence charged\t against them  could be\t held to  have\tbeen\nestablished.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">     Circulars issued subsequent to 1.11.68 would go to show\nthat A-2  (DAO) nor  A-3 (AAO)\twere required  to verify the\nRegistration number  of trucks in which the fertilisers were\nactually transported  to Allagadda. That was prescribed only\nsubsequent to  the date\t of the\t alleged offence.  Under the\nearlier circulars  there was  no such  requirement. Reliance\nwas placed  by the  prosecution on  circular dated 5.2.68 at\npage 29\t to 31\tof paper  book, Vol.II which require the A-2\n(DAO) to conduct physical verification of stocks received in\nthe district  and the manure mixing firm and report the same\nin a cover addressed to the Director of Agriculture by name.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">      There was no failure to verify on the part of A-2 when\nhe issued such a letter. That letter is extracted at page 70\nof the\tHigh Court judgment, Ex.P-87. No evidence is adduced\nby the prosecution to show that no stock was received by A-3\nand that  A-2 did  not physically  verify the stock. Not one\nwitness has so stated. The prosecution only insists upon the\ncourt to draw adverse inference against the accused from the\nfact that  A-1 had disposed of some fertilisers somewhere at\nKakinada, Bubli,  or Sompeta  after lifting  from  Kakinada.\nWhen  several\tcomplaints  were  made\tthat  officers\twere\ndelaying in  issuing  the  certificates\t the  procedure\t was\nmodified by circulars dated 27.6.1966 Ex.P-1 at page 149 and\ncircular  dated\t  12.3.1968  Ex.D-48   page   155.   Ex.D-48\nspecifically says  that DAO  (A-2) should  ensure  that\t the\nparties have  actually moved  the stock and for this purpose\nthe DAO\t may obtain  the certificate  of  verification\tfrom\nAgricultural Extension\tOfficer (A-3). A-2 has obtained such\ncertificate. Further, the Agricultural Extension Officer (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">3)  should  furnish  the  stock\t book  entry  of  the  depot\nconcerned. Admittedly  such an\tentry is  found\t and  it  is\nfurnished by  A-3 to  A-2 and  A-2 in turn has forwarded the\nsame  to   the\thigher\tauthorities.  Further,\tAgricultural\nExtension Officer  (A-3) is  required to make the stock book\nentry basing  on the material furnished in proforma 1 issued\nat the\tports. It  is the  admitted case  of the prosecution\nthat proforma  1 issued at the ports was so furnished. Hence\nthe certificate\t issued by  A-3 cannot\tbe said\t to be false\nwhen for  the purpose of ensuring actual movement of stocks,\nthese alone  were to  be taken\tinto account. As regards the\ncertificate to be issued by A-2 (which is at page 152 of the\nSpecial\t Leave\t Petition  paper   book),   circular   dated\n27.6.1966, states that in view of the clarification given by\nthe  Government\t  of  India,   the  following  procedure  is\nprescribed for\tcertification regarding\t rates and distance.\nThat procedure\twas followed.  There is\t no evidence  of the\nprosecution that  that procedure  was not followed. There is\nno allegation  that distance  and rates\t certified  are\t not\ncorrect.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">       Circular\t dated 5.2.1968 only emphasises the physical\nverification.  There   is  no\tevidence  that\the  has\t not\nphysically verified  issuing the certificate of distance and\nroute in  the covering\tletter addressed  to the Director of\nAgriculture. It\t does not  prescribe verifying\tRegistration\nNumber of trucks.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">       The  learned counsel appearing for the appellants who\nare government\tofficers have submitted that charges against\nthe government\tservants could\tnot be\testablished. Even if\nthe transporters  or dealers  in fertilisers  had  committed\nguilt they  were liable\t to be convicted for the part played\nby them\t but on\t account of  any guilt\ton the\tpart of\t the\ndealers, the  officers could not be prosecuted. Hence, there\nwas no\toccasion to  convict such  officers by reversing the\norders of acquittal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">       The  learned counsel  for other\tappellants  who\t are\ngovernment  officers   have   submitted\t  that\t facts\t and\ncircumstances in  other cases  are more\t or less similar. No\nvarification of\t stock at  the receiving  and had  been done\nimmediately after  receipt of  the goods  or even  within  a\nreasonable time.  Therefore, the  appellants for the grounos\nindicated in  Criminal\tAppeal\tNo.310\tof  1989  should  be\nacquitted by  setting aside the unjust and improper order of\nconviction and sentence passed by the High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_56\">     The learned counsel appearing for the dealers in their\nappeals have submitted that it was alleged that the dealers,\npursuant to the conspiracy with other accused namely the\ngovernment officers had preferred false claims for\nreimbursement of the road transport charges. It has been\ncontended that the dealers had obtained certificates about\nthe receipt of the goods transported at the destination\nissued by the competent government official. It had not been\nestablished that such goods had in fact not been received by\nleading any convincing positive evidence about the stock\nposition at the relevant time. No one had verified the stock\nat the receiving end either on the date of delivery or\nwithin reasonable time thereafter. Hence, it cannot be\ncontended that goods in question had not been transported at\nall but false claim for such transportation charge had been\nmade. It has been contended that the High Court allowed the\nappeals against the dealers mainly on the ground that there\nwere no entries at the checkposts and that there was\nevidence of sale of some fertilisers. Absence of entries in\nchekposts ipso facto did not establish that the lorries did\nnot ply through the routes in question. It could not be\nestablished beyond all reasonable doubts that invariably in\nall cases appropraite entries in checkposts had been made.\nIt has been established that checkpost entries had not\nalways been properly maintained. Hence, absence of entry in\nthe checkpost could not be held to be conclusive evidence\nabout non transportation of goods.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_57\">     It has also been contended that transportation of goods\nby alternative route was not prohibited. The only embargo\nwas that transportation charge should be paid on the basis\nof shortest route certified by competent government\nofficial. The learned counsel have contended that evidence\nabout sale of fertilizers at some places had been led by the\nprosecution. Such fact ipso facto, does not establish\nconclusively and beyond reasonable doubt as to whether the\ngoods to be transported had been sold and as such the same\nhad not been delivered at the destination. No proof has been\ngiven by the prosecution as to what quality of fertilisers\nhad been sold. There is also no evidence that no fertiliser\nwas available in the market in the entire region. It has\nbeen contended by the learned counsel for the appellants\nthat after a long lapse of time, an uproar was made in the\nState Assembly and in the media about large scale\nmanipulation in the transportation of fertilisers. It was\nonly because of public pressure that long after\ntransportation was effected enquiries were sought to be\nmade. It was unfortunate that the government could not place\nreliance on the State&#x27;s police and because of public uproar,\nC.B.I. was entrusted to cause enquiry into the allegation of\nscandal with the transportation of fertilisers. Admittedly,\nsuch enquiry had been made at a very belated stage when\nhardly there was any material or evidence to substantiate\nthe charges against the accused. It has been contended that\nknowing fully well that such allegations about the scandal\nin dealing with fertilizers could not be established for\nwant of proof, the government in order to pacify public\ndemand initiated the criminal cases against the appellants.\nThe trial court by giving detailed reasons acquitted all the\naccused in the criminal cases instituted against them. But\nas aforesaid, the High Court reassessed the findings of the\ntrial court and convicted the appellants mainly on the basis\nof suspicion, surmise and conjectures. It has been contended\nthat the token punishment given by the High Court amply\ndemonstrates that the High Court also entertained a feeling\nthat the guilt had not been established in a fully\nconvincing manner. In the aforesaid facts, the learned\ncounsel have submitted that the impugned decisions of the\nHigh Court have occasioned grave injustice and should be set\naside by this Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_58\">     The learned counsel appearing for the State of A.P. in\nthese appeals have, however, seriously disputed the\ncontentions made on behalf of the appellants. The learned\ncounsel for the State in Criminal Appeal No.310 of 1989 has\ncontended that transportation of fertilisers had to be made\nfrom the port of Kakinada to Allagadda in Karnool District.\nIt is the prosecution case that such fertiliser had not been\ntransported to the destination but the goods were sold at\nKakinada itself and at some intermediate places and the\ndealers made a false claim of transportation charge for a\nsum of Rs.13,972.50. A-3 who was the Agricultural Assistant\nOfficer and consignee of the goods made a false entry in the\nstock register to the effect that the fertilizers were\nreceived at Allogadda and on the oasis of certificate used\nby A-3 since endorsed by A-23, the District Agricultural\nOfficer about actual transportation of the fertilizers\nthrough shortest route, the claim of the dealer was allowed\nby the government. The prosecution alleged that there had\nbeen conspiracy and connivance between A-2 and A-3 and A-1\nto defraud the Government.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_59\">     Learned counsel for the State respondent in support of\nthe judgment has submitted that the prosecution in support\nof its case examined the owners of the lorries alleged to\nhave transported the goods from Kakinada to Allagada as PWs.\n6,7,8,16 and 22. It is the prosecution case that the\nfertilisers stated to have been carried to the destination\nat Allagada had been disposed of at Kakinada. Such\npurchasers of fertilisers were examined as PWs. 1-4, 13-15,\n21, 24, 29, 30, 34 and 35. The officials of the check post\non the regular route between Kakinada and Allagada were also\nexamined by the prosecution being PWs. 26-28 and 31. It has\nbeen contended by the learned counsel for the respondent\nthat unfortunately after long laspe of time it was not\npossible to lead direct evidence about the actual position\nof stock of fertilisers at the destination point on the date\nof alleged receipt of fertilisers or immediately thereafter.\nIt has been submitted that it was a large scale scandal in\nthe matter of transportation of imported fertilisers at\nvarious destinations at State of Andhra Pradesh and because\nthe fraud was perpetrated with the active connivance of the\ngovernment officials entrusted to receive the fertilisers at\nthe destination, such fraud could not be detected\nimmediately. He has submitted that it is unfortunate that\nthe C.B.I. had to be entrusted for causing enquiry because\neffective enquiry could not be made by the State agencies.\nSuch enquiry had been held long after the incident of fraud.\nNaturally, the C.B.I. was handicapped to a great extent but\ndespite the same the C.B.I. has done excellent job and by\nexamining the lorry owners, the persons purchasing the\nfertilisers stated to have been transported and the\nofficials in the check post. It has been conclusively\nestablished from depositions of such witnesses that the\nfertilisers in question had in fact not been transported to\ndestination. The learned counsel has submitted that once\nthis fact is clearly established that the fertilisers which\nhad been lifted at the port and was scheduled to be\ntransported at the destination Allagada had not been\ntransported by the lorries through which it was said to have\nbeen transported and it is also proved that fertilisers had\nin fact been sold elsewhere and such lorries did not pass\nthrough the usual route to be followed for such\ntransportation, there will be no difficulty in holding that\nthe certificate which was issued by the government officials\nabout the actual transportation of the said fertilisers by\nthe shortest route was false and fabricated and such\ncertificate had been issued without actually receiving the\ngoods. On the basis of such evidences since accepted by the\nHigh Court, the order of conviction by the High Court by\nreversing improper judgment of acquittal passed by the trial\ncourt is wholly justified and no interference is called for.\nThe trial court proceeded on surmise and conjecture. The\nlearned counsel has submitted that the High Court was fully\naware of the appeal court&#x27;s responsibilities and duties in\ndealing with the judgment of acquittal. Since the finding of\nthe trial court was completely against the weight of the\nevidence and such finding could not be held to be based on a\nreasonable view which could be taken on the basis of\nevidence adduced in the case, the High Court felt that such\norder of acquittal could not be sustained. Accordingly, the\nimpugned orders of conviction of sentence have been passed.\nIt has been submitted by the learned counsel for the\nrespondent that the trial court erred in drawing adverse\ninference against the prosecution case because the drivers\nof the lorries had not been examined but only the lorry\nowners were examined. The trial court also draw an adverse\ninference because the clerks of the lorry owners who made\nentries about the movement of the lorries in question had\nnot been examined. The learned counsel has submitted that\nsuch view of the trial court was wholly erroneous and\nunjustified. The lorry owners were competent to say whether\nthe lorry owned by them had been engaged for the\ntransportation of the fertilisers in question and it was not\nnecessary to examine the drivers who actually drove the\nlorries. The owners of the lorries were expected to know the\nhand writings of the clerks engaged by them in the registers\nmaintained in their office. To prove such entries about the\nmovement of lorries, the clerks were not required to be\nexamined and no adverse inference was required to be drawn\nfor not examining the clerks. It has been submitted that the\nHigh Court observed that there were several Circulars issued\nprior to March 12, 1968 and subsequent to March 12, 1960 and\nsuch circulars only indicated the responsibilities of the\nAgricultural Officer. It has been submitted that the High\nCourt elaborately dealt with the circulars and held that\ndespite specific guidelines given, the accused A-2 and A-3\ndeliberately failed and neglected to perform their official\nduties. The learned counsel has submitted that in a case\ngoverned by the circumstantial evidence it is often very\ndifficult to prove when the minds of the accused met and it\nis only from the facts proved, the reasonable inference can\nbe drawn about the collusion between A-2 and A-3, namely,\nthe government officials and the dealer in fertilisers A-1.\nIt has been contended by the learned counsel for the\nrespondent that the owner of lorry PW.6 was examined by the\nprosecution. The said owner was the best person to speak\nabout the fact whether his lorry had been taken on hire at\nthe relevant time for transporting the goods. The lorry\nowner is not expected to maintain the trip sheets written\nsome time in 1968 when he was examined after several years.\nP.W 35 the clerk in the shop of G. Surya Narayana stated\nthat he had purchased 340 bags of urea from PW 30 Bhoja\nDharam Raju &amp; Company, Kakinada and by making an entry he\ntook delivery of the said 340 bags of urea. PW 30 was also\nexamined to prove that Bhoja Dharma Raju and Company had\nsold 340 bags of urea. Ex.P.164 and P.167 are the sale bills\nissued by Dharma Raju. Ex.P.65 and P.67 are the two sale\nbills which were also sent with the lorries and by which the\nstocks were sent. Such bills clearly established that the\nlorry did not proceed on the same date to Kakinada and any\nstatement to that effect was false. Ex.P.164 is the seal of\nRamabhadrapuram check post entry. It has been contended by\nthe learned counsel for the respondent that if the lorry in\nquestion had in fact travelled by any other route, such fact\nwas within special knowledge of the accused trader. In that\nevent, the burden shifts to the accused to prove the special\nfacts within his knowledge. The owner of the lorry had been\nexamined as PW 7 and the said owner had proved the entry\nEx.P.20 in the day book maintained by him on 9.10.1968. The\ntrip sheet Ex.P.21 dated 11.10.1968 shows that the lorry\nmade a trip from Kakinada to Sompeta. Sompeta is situated\nwithin Srikakulam District which is at one end of the State\nof Andhra Pradesh touching the border State of Orissa. It\nhas been established by examining the officials of the check\nposts that there is no entry in any of the check posts\nbetween Kakinada and Allagada in respect of the lorry in\nquestion namely lorry bearing No. A.P.W.4926. Ex.P.39 is the\naccount book dated October 10, 1968 showing that fertilizers\nbelonging to A-1 were loaded in the said lorry. The account\nbook of P.W.30 shows that they purchased the fertilisers on\nOctober 10, 1968 and the trip sheet shows that the\nfertilisers had in fact been transported to a different\nplace. From such evidences a reasonable conclusion can be\ndrawn that the said lorry did not reach the destination.\nP.W.1 is the husband of the owner of lorry No. APP 8379. The\nsaid witness has stated that Ex.P.1 is the trip sheet and\nhis lorry did not transport any fertiliser to Allagadda and\nhe does not know whereabout of his driver Rama Rao. P.W.22\nis the clerk who identified the signatures of Rama Rao,\nDriver. P.W.33 gave evidence to the effect that the lorry\nmade a trip from Kakinada to Amatalagalsa and identified\nEx.P.58 the way bill and stated that the vehicle did not\ntransport any fertiliser for Thallam Trading Company namely\nA-1 from Kakinada to Allagadda on October 10, 1968. So far\nas the transporter of fertilisers of lorry No. APV 7335 is\nconcerned, the owner of the lorry P.W 24 has proved that the\nEx.P.28 is the trip sheet dated January 10, 1968 which shows\nthat the lorry transported from Kakinada to Rajam. Rajam is\nin Srikakulam District. Such fact clearly indicates that the\nfertiliser in question had not been transported by lorry No.\nAPV 7335. The learned counsel has submitted that even if\ntransportation by one of the lorry appears to have not been\nconclusively proved, there is no difficulty in convicting\nthe accused if non delivery of the fertiliser at the\ndestination on other occasions is established. The learned\ncounsel has submitted that ingenuous plea has been taken for\nraising unfounded doubts to the effect that the case had not\nbeen established beyond all reasonable doubts. Accordingly,\nthe benefit of doubt should go to the accused. Such case of\nthe accused, however, should not be accepted for the simple\nreason that the prosecution has established by examining the\npurchasers of fertilisers, the lorry owners, the officials\nof the check posts that such lorries had not transported the\nfertiliser at the destination and the lorries had in fact\ntransported different goods at other destinations. On the\nbasis of such evidence, only conclusion can be drawn that a\nfalse certificate was procured by the dealer A-1 and false\ncertificates were given by the local government officials,\nA-2 and A-3 in perpetrating a deep rooted conspiracy to\ndefraud public exchequer. It has been contended that the\nlearned counsel for the State that the Assistant\nAgricultural Officer was the consignee of the goods. He was\nrequired to make an entry in the stock register after\nphysically verifying that the goods had in fact been\ntransported. It was on the basis of such receipt of goods\nthat he was required to issue certificate that the goods had\nreached the destination. The other accused namely the\nDistrict Agricultural Officer had to satisfy himself about\nthe physical arrival of goods for the purpose forwarding the\nclaim of the dealer for payment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_60\">     The learned counsel has further submitted that several\ncirculars were issued from time to time by the competent\nauthorities with regard to the verification of stocks and\ncertificate to be issued on the genuineness of the claim.\nBetween 1958 and 1968, different circulars have been issued\non different dates. The subsequent circulars issued after\nthe commencement of offence however need not be considered\nfor these appeals Ex.P.83, the circular dated June 24, 1964\nrequires that the Assistant Agricultural Officer should\nsatisfy himself that the goods were actually transported by\nshortest route through the mode of transport claimed in the\nbill and the rates mentioned said Assistant Agricultural\nOfficer had verified the same and found correct. Such\ncertificate only points out that he was a party to\nconspiracy and when the goods had in fact not reached the\ndestination, he issued a false certificate only for the\npurpose of defrauding public exchequer. It has been also\nsubmitted by the learned counsel for the respondents that\nthe trial court failed to consider some of the relevant\nmaterials and it had also considered some materials\nimproperly. It is because of such errors and omissions that\nthe High Court was fully justified in considering the\nevidences and setting aside the orders of acquittal passed\nagainst the weight of the evidence. It has been submitted by\nthe learned counsel for the State that a very lenient\nsentence by the High Court has been passed but such lenient\nsentence by no means establishes that the accused are not\nguilty. The Court in awarding sentence takes mitigating\ncircumstances into consideration. The case continued for\nlong because large number of documents had been exhibited\nand large number of witnesses were examined. The Government\nofficials had to suffer because of the pendency of criminal\ncases. Considering such mitigating circumstances, it is\nquite likely that a lenient sentence has been passed by the\nHigh Court. The learned counsel for the respondent submits\nthat there is no merit in the appeals and the same should be\ndismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_61\">     The facts and circumstances of the case in the other\nappeals are more or less the same. The prosecution by\nexamining the purchasers of the fertilizers the owners of\nthe transport, officials of the check posts on usual routes,\ntried to establish that the fertilisers in question had not\nin fact been carried to the destination. Hence, no bill for\nsuch transportation could be presented by the dealers and no\ncertificate about transportation of such goods by the\nshortest route at a reasonable cost could be issued by the\ngovernment officials. Accordingly, it was contended by the\nlearned counsel for the state that the conviction in all the\ncases should be upheld and this Court should dismiss the\nappeals preferred by the accused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">     After giving our anxious consideration to the facts and\ncircumstances of the case and considering the judgments by\nboth the courts and evidences adduced in the case through\nwhich we have been taken by the learned counsel for the\nparties, it appears to us that a large scale fraud had been\ncommitted in the matter of transportation of fertilisers\nfrom the ports of arrival to various destinations in the\nState of Andhra Pradesh. Such fertilisers had been brought\nat a point of time when the State was in dire need of good\nquality of fertilisers for cultivation. It is the case of\nthe prosecution that large scale fraud had been committed by\na large number of government officials in conspiracy with\nthe dealers in fertilisers who were entrusted to take the\nfertilisers from the port to various government godowns. The\nprosecution case is because there was a conspiracy involving\nreasonable government officials, the fraud could not be\ndetected earlier. Thereafter, when the State Police was\nentrusted with the enquiry, for some inexplicable reasons,\nthe enquiry appeared to be tardy. In the meantime, uproar\nwas made in the State Assembly and the newspapers published\nthe news of large scale scandal relating to transportation\nof fertilisers. The embarrassed State Government thereafter\nentrusted the C.B.I. to make enquiries. The C.B.I. made\nenquiries and charge sheets were filed. There is no manner\nof doubt that by that time it was quite late and the C.B.I.\nwas handicapped in causing more effective enquiry. Despite\nsuch fact, it appears to us that the C.B.I. has done\nexcellent job by examining the lorry owners, the clerks of\nthe lorry owners, the officials of different check posts and\nalso the purchasers of fertilisers at different places for\nthe purpose of showing that the fertilisers lifted from the\nport and stated to have been transported at different\ndestinations had in fact not been transported in the manner\nalleged but on the basis of false entries made by the\ngovernment officials and also by issuing false certificate\nof such transportation payments had been made.\nUnfortunately, no evidence has been led whether fertilisers\nin fact had not been delivered on the relevant date at the\ndestination by proving the stock register at the relevant\ntime. It is really unfortunate that in a case of such\nmagnitude senior officials of the concerned department were\nnot examined. No witness from the locality of the godown was\nalso examined to show that on the relevant dates no delivery\nof fertiliser at the destination had taken place. Unless by\nunimpeachable and convincing evidence, the factum of non\ndelivery of such fertilisers with reference to actual stock\nposition on the relevant date can be clearly established, in\nour view, it becomes very difficult to proceed on the\nfooting that the concerned government officials issued false\ncertificate about receipt of the goods on the dates in\nquestion. There is force in the contention of the learned\ncounsel for the appellants that it was not unlikely that\nsome fertilisers had in fact been delivered to the\ngovernment officials at the destination. On the basis of\nsuch delivery, the certificates had been issued by them. It\n0is not the case of the prosecution that the quality of the\nfertilisers was required to be examined by the officers at\nthe receiving end and they had proper infrastructure to make\nsuch exercise. It has been rightly contended that it was not\nestablished that the fertilisers was not available anywhere\nin the locality so that it was not possible to replace the\nquantity of fertiliser after selling the original\nconsignment. Simply on the basis of evidence given by lorry\nowners that their lorries did not carry the fertiliser or\nsuch lorries had gone to different places and some\nfertilisers were sold by the dealers to other persons, non\ndelivery of fertiliser at the destination by other means can\nnot be fully ruled out. The circumstances are undoubtedly\nvery intriguing and raise considerable doubt but in the\nabsence of unimpeachable direct evidence about the actual\nstock position at the receiving end, the indirect\ncircumstantial evidences, in our view do not establish the\nprosecution case beyond all reasonable doubts. It is true\nthat there is no absolute standard of proof in a criminal\ntrial and the court should not nurture fanciful doubts by\nexaggerated devotion to the rule of benefit of doubt but in\na case of circumstantial evidence all the links in the chain\nof events from which irresistible conclusion about the guilt\nof the accused for the offence alleged can be drawn, must be\nestablished beyond the pale of reasonable doubt. The court\nhas to be watchful and avoid the danger of allowing\nsuspicion to take the place of legal proof. Conviction can\nnot be based on circumstances indicating that the\nprosecution case is quite likely to be true. For basing the\nconviction in a case governed by circumstantial evidence,\nthe facts established must rule out any likelihood of\ninnocence of the accused. The exact stock position on the\nalleged date of delivery of fertiliser which would have\nrepelled any other possibility is unfortunately not\nforthcoming. It does not appear that any attempt to\nestablish the actual stock position of fertiliser in the\ngodown in question on the relevant date or soon thereafter\nwith reference to register of stock or any other\ncontemporaneous document has been made. It is only through\nnegative and indirect evidence the prosecution is attempting\nto establish that the fertiliser had not been delivered.\nSuch evidence would have been very convincing to corroporate\nthe direct evidence about the stock position in the event\nthe correctness of such stock position was challenged. So\nlong the possibility of some other conclusion cannot be\nfully ruled out, the prosecution case remains in the realm\nof probability.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">     In the facts of the case, we are of the view that the\ngovernment officials who are appellants in some of these\nappeals cannot be held to be guilty with all certainty and\nthey are entitled to get the benefit of doubt. The appeals,\npreferred by the government officials therefore, should be\nallowed by setting aside the conviction of sentence passed\nagainst them by the High Court. It appears to us that\nalthough the High Court reversed the orders of acquittal in\nconvicting the government officials, the High Court perhaps\nfelt that some convincing evidences were lacking and it is\nnot unlikely that for the said reasons, although the High\nCourt convicted the government officials for serious\noffences charged against them only a token sentence of fine\nof Rs.100/- and detention till the rising of the Court had\nbeen passed which sentence normally should not have been\npassed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">     So far as the appeals preferred by the dealers of the\nfertilisers are concerned, it appears to us that direct and\npositive evidences have been led by the prosecution to show\nthat the fertilisers were not transported by the dealers in\nthe manner alleged by them. If the dealers had transported\nthe fertilisers by a different route or by any other\ntransport and if they had sold different fertilisers, such\nfacts were within their special knowledge and in the facts\nof the case, the dealers ought to have satisfied the court\nthat the fertilisers had in fact been transported by other\ntransports and in a manner different from what was mentioned\nin the bills. The evidence adduced by the prosecution by\nexamining lorry owners, clerks of such owners, officers of\nthe check posts on the usual routes convincingly point out\nthat the fertiliser was not transported in the way it\nappeared in the bills since certified by the government\nofficials at the destination. If some fertilisers of equal\nquantity had been handed over at the destination, it was not\nunlikely that the government officials having taken delivery\nof such fertilisers without appreciating the fraud and with\nreference to the record of loading of the fertiliser at\nport, would be justified in issuing certificate about\ntransportation at reasonable rate by the shortest route. As\nthe possiblity of delivering fertiliser of similar quantity\nwhich may not be qualitatively same, by procuring them\nlocally, when non availability of fertiliser in the region\nhad not been established by the prosecution, cannot be fully\nruled out, the government officers, in our view, were\nentitled to benefit of doubt. But in the facts of the case,\nsuch benefit will not be available to the dealers. We,\ntherefore, do not find any reason to interfere with the\norders of conviction passed against the dealers and their\nappeals being Criminal Appeals Nos.163,165,166,184 and 185\nof 1994 are dismissed. Criminal Appeal No.164 of 1994 has\nbeen preferred both by the dealers and the government\nofficials. Such appeal stands allowed in part and conviction\nand sentence passed against the government officials being\nappellants Nos. 3 to 5 stand set aside and they are\nacquitted. But the appeal preferred by appellants Nos. 1 &amp; 2\nstands dismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">     It is  really unfortunate that in fertiliser scandal of\nsuch magnitude,\t appropriate steps at the right time had not\nbeen taken  and for  want of  convincing  and  unimpeachable\nevidence, the  accused who  were government  officials\thave\nbeen acquitted\tby giving  them benefit of doubt. It appears\nto us that such large scale scandal in transporting imported\nfertiliser would  not have  occurred  if  larger  number  of\ngovernment officials  and others  than prosecuted  were\t not\ninvolved.  It  is  not\tunlikely  that\tsuperior  government\nofficials had  also played  a vital role in perpetrating the\nsaid fraud  or concealing the same. The tardy enquiries made\nby the\tState police thereby necessitating an enquiry by the\nC.B.I. at  a belated  stage is\tonly a sad commentary on the\nefficiency of  the police  administration. We  may only hope\nthat in future there will be proper vigilance and scandal of\nthis type may not take place.\n</p>\n\n\n","numcites":4,"numcitedby":64,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":806030,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"circumstantial evidence","formInput":"circumstantial%20evidence"},{"value":"benefit of doubt ","formInput":"benefit%20of%20doubt%20"},{"value":"adverse inference","formInput":"adverse%20inference"},{"value":"false certificate","formInput":"false%20certificate"},{"value":"direct evidence","formInput":"direct%20evidence"},{"value":"False claims","formInput":"False%20claims"},{"value":"lenient sentencing","formInput":"lenient%20sentencing"},{"value":"conspiracy","formInput":"conspiracy"},{"value":"check post","formInput":"check%20post"},{"value":"reasonable time","formInput":"reasonable%20time"},{"value":"340","formInput":"340"},{"value":"\"false certificate\"","formInput":"%22false%20certificate%22"},{"value":"\\\"circumstantial evidence\\\"","formInput":"%5C%22circumstantial%20evidence%5C%22"},{"value":"\"adverse inference\"","formInput":"%22adverse%20inference%22"},{"value":"\"special knowledge\"","formInput":"%22special%20knowledge%22"},{"value":"adducing evidence","formInput":"adducing%20evidence"},{"value":"\"route\"","formInput":"%22route%22"},{"value":"333","formInput":"333"},{"value":"trucks","formInput":"trucks"},{"value":"circumstantial evidence is of no evidence","formInput":"circumstantial%20evidence%20is%20of%20no%20evidence"}],"cats":[{"value":"does-not-effect-mutiny-and-desertion","formInput":"tag:does-not-effect-mutiny-and-desertion"},{"value":"theft","formInput":"tag:theft"},{"value":"corruption","formInput":"tag:corruption"},{"value":"falsification-of-accounts","formInput":"tag:falsification-of-accounts"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
