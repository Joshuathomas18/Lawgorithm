The latter is directed against the judgment and order also of S.\nPadmanabhan, Judge of the High Court of Kerala dated September 19, 1988 in\nCriminal Appeal No. 194 of 1987, in which R. Vikraman is the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">All these matters shall be disposed of by a common order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">CRIMINAL APPEAL ARISING OUT OF S.L.P. NO. 180 OF 1989 :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">The appellant, Gopalan Nair, was the driver of Bus no. KLX 3627 belonging\nto the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation. At the relevant time it was\nunder repairs in one of its workshops. At about 3.00 p.m. on 26-6-85, the\nbut after repairs with a board hung &quot;ON TRIAL&quot; was taken out on a trial run\nby the appellant on a particular road at Ernakulam. It is the case of the\nprosecution that he drove the bus in a rash and negligent manner\nendangering human life or causing hurt or injury to pedestrians and other\nvehicular traffic. While doing so it hit against a pedestrian, P.W.7 who\nwas walking in the same direction as was the bus with the result that he\nwas knocked down on the road getting injuries. The but then hit against a\ntree whereby P.Ws. 1, 2 and 8 who were inmates of the bus were injured.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">These consequences resulted because the appellant allegedly had over-taken\na bus parked on the side of the road alighting passengers in front of St.\nTheresa&#x27;s Convent, ignoring a car coming from the opposite direction. On\nthe other hand, the positive defence of the appellant was that the\nhappening of the accident was beyond his control on account of brake\nfailure. The appellant&#x27;s version in his statement, made at the trial for\noffences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1270101/\" id=\"a_1\">section 279</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1402213/\" id=\"a_2\">337</a> I.P.C. before the Judicial\nMagistrate, IInd Class, Ernakulam, was that on seeing the bus parked in\nfront of him, he had applied brakes but there was no response and the foot\npaddle completely went down due to brake failure. Perceptibly, at that\nmoment, he claims to have swerved the bus to avoid larger loss and caused\nit to jam against a tree and that the P.Ws had been injured for no fault of\nhis.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">P.W. 1, one of the injured inmates of the bus went on support the brake\nfailure theory of the appellant. He was a mechanic attached to the\ndivisional workshop of the Kerala State Road Transport Corporation and thus\nthe appellant&#x27;s charge-man. He also supported the version of the appellant\nwith regard to the necessity to swerve the bus, as otherwise more harm\nwould have ensued by damage to human life and property. For obvious reasons\nhe was declared hostile. Likewise P.Ws. 2 and 8, other mechanics of the\nKerala State Road Transport Corporation and injured inmates of the bus\ndeposed in favour of the appellant. They too were declared hostile. Police\nConstable, P.W.4 on traffic duty was an eye witness and according to him,\nthe appellant had carelessly attempted to overtake the parked bus resulting\ninjuries to a pedestrian, P.W.7, and colliding against a tree. Therefore,\nit is on the injuries of P.W.7 that the prosecution case was ultimately\nbuilt up. But according to P.W. 7 he did not known by whose fault the\nincident had occurred, though he had come to know that the appellant was\ndriving the bus at the time of the incident. Pleading for himself he had\nsaid that the was not at fault at all.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">The brake failure case then rightly hinged on the value to be attached to\nthe evidence of P.W. 3, the then Motor Vehicles Inspector, Ernakulam and\nhis Inspection Report P-l. Two days after the accident i.e. on 26-8-1985,\nhe claims to have inspected the offending bus and according to him the\nbrake system of the bus was efficient, and there was no mechanical defect.\nIn opposition, defence witnesses, who were mechanics of the Transport\nCorporation stating that after the accident the master cylinder the\nhydraulic brake system of the bus had to be changed, were not believed by\nthe trial Magistrate. Complete reliance on the road-worthiness of the\nvehicle was placed on the evidence of P.W.3. As a result the appellant was\nconvicted for offences under sections 279 and 337 I.P.C. and sentenced to\npay a fine of Rs, 500 in default to undergo simple imprisonment for 45 days\nfor offence under section 297 I.P.C. but no separate sentence was imposed\nfor offence under section 337 I.P.C.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">The appellant took the matter in appeal before Smt. V. Sujatha, Chief\nJudicial Magistrate, Ernakulam. After reappraising the entire evidence, she\nallowed the appeal, setting aside the convictions and sentence. The\nevidence of P.W. 3, the Assistant Motor Vehicles Inspector and his\nInspection Report Ex. P-l, in which he had noted the damage, came under\nheavy criticism by her. The inspection report seemingly was in the form of\na questionnaire in Column 11, the Inspector was required to mention what\nwas the cause of failure of the foot brake, and whether it was (a)\nhydraulic or (b) mechanical. He kept (a) blank and remarked in (b) &quot;Not\napplicable&quot;. The learned Chief Judicial Magistrate finding (a) left blank\nviewed that when the evidence of P.W. 3 at the trial was that the foot\nbrake was efficient having no mechanical defect, he was required to answer\nin column (a) that the hydraulic brake system (a brake in which the force\nis generated and transmitted by means of a compressed fluid) was in order.\nShe thus safely inferred that by keeping the space at (a) blank he had not\nchecked the hydraulic system as such. The appellant&#x27;s version was that he\nhad thrust the brake paddle down to the maximum but got no response,\nmeaning thereby that the hydraulic system was not functional. Therefore,\nhis quick reflexes prompted him to swerve the vehicle to avoid larger loss\nto life and property, like colliding with a car coming from the opposite\ndirection and wherefor P.W. 7 was hurt. The learned Chief Judicial\nMagistrate appreciated his stance because the place of the incident was. in\nfront of the St. Theresa&#x27;s Convent where a large number of students were\nstudying and her opinion those could have been put to danger but for the\nquick reaction of the appellant. She thus went on to hold that when P.W. 3\nhad not cared to check up the hydraulic brake system, his Inspection Report\nhad to be negatived. She then went on to observe as follows :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;So, one cannot find fault with the accused. But what provoked the learned\nMagistrate to find the accused/appellant guilty is nothing but a personal\nvendetta.......................1 have no hesitation to quote that the\nlearned Magistrate went utterly wrong in finding the accused/appellant\nguilty.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">Holding so, she recorded an order of acquittal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">The State of Kerala filed an appeal against acquittal before the High Court\nof Kerala which was placed before Padmanabhan, J. for final disposal that\nappeal was allowed on September 8, 1988 and the appellant judgment and\norder of V. Sujatha, Chief Judicial Magistrate was set aside and sentence\nimposed by trial magistrate restored. It is against this order that we have\ngranted leave.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">There are two aspects which have to be taken care of. One relates to the\nguilt or otherwise of the appellant. The second relates to some adverse\nremarks made by Padmanabhan, J. against Smt. V. Sujatha, Chief Judicial\nMagistrate, Ernakulam. Her grievance is triple faceted. One re-lates to the\nadverse remarks against her mentioned in the judgment under appeal. She\nwants them expunged. She is challenging the said order in her own right.\nShe had earlier made an application for expunction of those remarks to the\nlearned Judge of the High Court but when realising that it would be\nappropriate for her to move this Court in appeal, she prayed before the\nlearned Single Judge for withdrawal of the application. The learned Single\njudge disallowed that prayer. This is her second grievance which has given\nher a a right to approach this Court in appeal. Then finally when the\napplication for expunction of remarks was partially allowed by the learned\nSingle Judge, aggrieved by the non-expunction of the remaining remarks, and\nsuggestedly addition of some others, has also given her the third cause and\nright to approach this Court in appeal. These appeals on her behalf among\nthemselves are Criminal Appeal Nos. 653-655 of 1989. Their fate has got\nentwined with Gopalan Nair&#x27;s appeal, as would be plain hereafter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">The learned Judge of the High Court in Paragraph 11 of the Judgment has\nobserved as follows :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;I recorded all these facts only because I was really worried in the manner\nin which a good reasoned judgment of the trial Magistrate was reversed by a\nshabby judgment written by the Chief Judicial Magistrate and that too with\nunjustified attacks against the trial Magistrate and P.W.3 and unmerited\nencomium to the respon-dent.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">Further observations made were :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">The reasons alleged by the Chief Judicial Magistrate for disbeliev-ing P.W.\n3 are: (1) &quot;He conceded that he did not check whether the brake was\nhydraulic or not.&quot; This finding is a judicial dishonesty by the Chief\nJudicial Magistrate.....,.........,................\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">(2) &quot;In questionnaire ll(a) cause of failure of foot brake (a) if hydraulic\nhe did not answer. Likewise, quarry ll(b) if mechanical, he answered &quot;not\napplicable&quot;. But he deposed in chief that &quot;foot brake system was efficient\nand no mechanical defects&quot;. This is quite unreasonable. I fail to\nunderstand how the stand taken by the Chief Judicial Magistrate that he did\nnot answer ll(a) is a judicial\ndishonesty.....................................\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">And so on are other adverse remarks, using harsh language against the Chief\nJudicial Magistrate in justification for upsetting the orders of acquittal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">Adverting to the merits of Gopalan Nair&#x27;s appeal, the learned Single Judge\nof the High Court opined that the evidence of P.W.4 clinched the issue. It\nis to be recalled that he was the traffic policeman on duty. He had given\nhis version about the way in which the bus swerved knocking down P.W.7 and\nthen jamming against a tree on the footpath. We fail to see how evidence of\nP.W.4 clinches the issue. These facts, which speak for them-selves, are not\ndenied by Gopalan Nair. It is the mechanical road-worthi-ness or otherwise\nof the offending vehicle which would clinch the issue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">With regard to P.W.7, the learned Single Judge commented that when it is\nsaid by him that he did not know anything except that the incident was not\ndue to any negligence on his part, it appears that the accused (appellant\nherein) paid him sufficient money and hence he was not interested in giving\nany incriminating evidence. To say the least, there is no basis for such\ninsinuation against the appellant herein. We are left guessing as to what\nprovoked the learned Single Judge to be so vocal against the appellant or\nagainst P.W. 7. There was no suggestion much less evidence in that regard.\nWe do not appreciate this uncalled for remark by the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">With regard to PW.3, the Motor Vehicles Inspector, it is noteworthy that he\nhaving deposed that the foot brake system was efficient with no mechanical\ndefect, it was the right of the defence to tear his opinion apart and pick\nholes in Inspection Report Ex.P.1. As is plain, Column 11 of the\nquestionnaire requires cause of failure of the foot brake to be mentioned,\nwhether mechanical or hydraulic. Such as those who have elementary\nknowledge of driving a vehicle, know that hydraulic foot brake, are highly\nefficient, but are more prone to failure by wear and tear, because of power\ngeneration and transmission by means of brake fluid through the master\ncylinder, which force is set into motion by pushing the foot brake paddle.\nSuch pressure is felt by the driver when the brakes get functional. In case\nof brake failure, the foot paddle is unresponsive, for no pressure is felt.\nBut sometimes by repetitive paddling, pressure is built up even when\nmalfunctioning. P.W.3 claims to have driven the bus to say that the &quot;foot\nbrake system was efficient with no mechanical defects&quot;. But he did not\ncheck the hydraulic system as such to any weakening or malfunctioning. Had\nhe done so, he could have filled column ll(a) as well &quot;Not applicable&quot;. If\nthe bus was road-worthy, there was no reason why three mechanics, who are\nstamped witnesses, P.W.s 1, 2 and 8 should be in the bus for a trial run.\nThus, in our view, the evidence of P.W.3 was unnecessarily given high\nimportance by the High Court, when there was considerable suspicion in a\npart of the preparation of Inspection Report Ex.P-1, We thus hold that it\nis not safe to rely on the evidence of P.W.3 or on his report Ex.P.1\n\nWe are also of the view that the High Court did not appreciate the defence\nled by the respondent through the employees of the Road Transport\nCorporation, who had disclosed that the master cylinder in the brake system\nhad to be replaced in the offending bus. Here again, the learned Single\nJudge rejected the defence evidence and made an unwarranted remark against\nthe employees of the Transport Corporation by observing as following:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">&quot;It is possible of the employees in the K.S.R.T.C. to manipulate records by\nmaking entries b the work register and preparing an issue notice. By such a\nnotice they are only to gain because the cylinder could be otherwise\nutilised by them&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">There was absolutely no basis for such a remark. The issuance of master\ncylinder from the store was by an official document. It was put as a\nreplacement in the offending bus, was again a matter of record. It cannot\nbe imagined that all this evidence was created by the Transport Corpora-\ntion employees merely to support the defence of the appellant. He was one\nemployee in large contingent. No special interest could have been aroused\nfor him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">Lastly, the learned -Single Judge has assumed that when a bus goes out for\na &quot;trial run&quot;, it is presumed that it was after complete repairs in the\nworkshop and that such presumption should apply to the offending bus. In\nthe first place, we find it difficult to accept there is such a\npresumption, but even if it be so, it gets rebutted by the actual\nperformance of the vehicle, A &quot;trial run&quot; is after all a test run to\nsatisfy the repairers that the repair work has been completed to their\nsatisfaction. It may not necessarily relate to the repairs effected for in\nthe trial run, other defects can be noticed or detected as well, which may\nhave escaped notice earlier. Putting a vehicle to trial run, therefore, is\nnot certifying to its road-worthiness. Rather the requirement of the rules\nthat a board should be hung on the vehicle to that effect is to warn all\nconcerned that such a vehicle on road is not absolutely road-worthy but was\nbeing tested for the purpose, and the possibility of its failing could not\nbe ruled out. It thus appears to us that the High Court over rated this\npoint.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">For all these reasons, we are of the view that the High Court was in error\nin upsetting the well considered judgment passed by the Chief Judicial\nMagistrate on merits. Accordingly, we set aside the impugned judgment and\norder of the High Court, restoring that of the Chief Judicial Magistrate,\nwith the result, the appellant, Gopalan Nair, gets acquitted of the\ncharges. Criminal Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (Criminal)\nNo. 180 of 1989 would thus stand allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 625 OF 1988 :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">The appellant, R, Vikraman was the Managing Director of a partner-ship\nconcern known as &quot;Bell Foods&quot;. He alongwith his wife, the second accused,\nand his brother, the third accused were put up for trial by the C.B.I,\nbefore Smt, V. Sujatha, Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ernakulam for offences\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_3\">sections 120-B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_4\">420</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1985627/\" id=\"a_5\">467</a>,<a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_6\">468</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_7\">471</a>.P.C. Vide order dated\n25th October, 1986, the learned Chief Judicial Magistrate acquitted the\naccused of all offences. The C.B.I. filed an appeal against the acquittal\nbefore the High Court of Kerala. S. Padmanabhan, J. of that Court allowed\nthe appeal vide order dated September 19,1988 maintaining acquittal of the\nwife and brother of the appellant but recording conviction of the appellant\non two counts namely <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections 420</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_9\">471</a> I.P.C. awarding him punishment of\nrigorous imprisonment for a period of one year under each count and\nadditionally under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_10\">section 420</a> I..P.C. paying of a fine of Rs. 10,000 in\ndefault of payment of which simple imprisonment for six months. The\njudgment and order of Mrs. V. Sujatha, Chief Judicial Magistrate was upset\nto this limited extent, just after 11 days and under the hangover of the\npassing of the order in Gopalan Nair&#x27;s case, which order we have upset,\nwherein, as said before, are certain remarks made against Smt V. Sujatha,\nfor which there is an appeal for expunction, linked up as it is, for\ndisposal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">Bell foods was firm of Cochin engaged in the export of Sea Foods and the\nthree accused were partners thereof. The appellant was its Managing\nDirector. The prosecution case was that from October, 1979, he entered into\na criminal conspiracy for the export of 310 cartons of sub-standard frozen\nshrimps by forging and using Quality Control Certificate (QCC) and\nCertificate of Origin (COO) as genuine knowing them to be forged in order\nto receive payment of price from the Dena Bank. Farther case of the\nprosecution is that using these certificates as genuine, he obtained\nclearance from the Customs for shipment and exported sub-standard goods,\nthereby cheating the Customs Department, the Export Inspection Agency and\nthe Marine Products Export Development Agency as well as the foreign buyer.\nIt was also the case of the prosecution that the accused cheated the Dena\nBank by producing the forged COO and drawing a sum of Rs. 4,88,501.60.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">The modus operandi for purposes of exporting Marine Products was stated to\nbe in this manner. The exporter had to obtain QCC from the Export\nInspection Agency, which had to be issued after inspection by drawing\nsamples and putting them to scientific tests. The exporter would have to\nmake an application for the purpose on paying the requisite fee in a\nparticular manner. On the issuance of QCC, the goods for export were to be\nproduced in the wharf. QCC and other papers are required to be presented\nbefore the Customs for clearance. In order to claim the benefits of\nshipping, it is necessary for the exporter to obtain and show a COO.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">To further their export, the Bell Foods are accused of having forged the\nrequisite QCC in order to export the said 310 cartons of sub-standard\nfrozen Shrimps to foreign buyer in London. Those goods on arrival at London\nwere found to be sub-standard and unworthy for palate. The foreign buyer\ncomplained to the Central Government through the Indian Embassy. Tracing\nthe export, it was found that the original QCC was not available with\neither the Export Inspection Agency or the Customs authorities. Bell foods\nwere, therefore, contacted. It is the case of the prosecution that the\nappellant herein produced the original QCC, (precise-ly a carbon copy)\nbefore P.W. 3 and 23 who took two Photostat copies of the same and original\nwas returned to the appellant, one copy was kept on the file and other was\nsent to the Export Inspection Agency. The signatures of the Assistant\nDirector purporting to be on such carbon copy, from which Photostat copies\nwere prepared, were forged in as much as those signatures were not that of\nthe concerned Assistant Director. The Photostat copies of the suggested\nforged documents were sent to an expert P.W. 24 for opinion, but he\nexpressed his inability to give any opinion on a Photostat copy.\nSignificantly the originals were available with the department, as it\npointedly appeared at the trial. P.W. 9,10,11 and 12 who were departmental\nmen stated that the original QCC was with the Customs. In the absence of\nthe original QCC, It could not be established that the Photostat copy Ex.\nP-9 was that of the original QCC. As said before, the hand-writing expert,\nP.W, 24 had thrown up his hands in despair. It is On this State of evidence\nthat the High Court recorded the conviction of the appellant under section\n471I.P.C.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">Further case of the prosecution is that the accused similarly and\nfraudulently obtained a COO by forging the signatures of the Asstt,\nDirector and used it for cheating the bank and the buyer in obtaining price\npayment of Rs. 4,88,501.60 for the consignment, and thereby cheated the\nbuyer and Dena Bank, Cochin, and had made themselves punishable for a\nsimilar offence as also <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 420</a> I.P.C. Here Ex.P-15, Photostat copy of\nthe COO was sought to be introduced as the forged document despite the fact\nthat the original of P-15 was available, The complaint of the Dena Bank\nwith regard to their having been cheated, filed before the Criminal Court\nwas quashed in a proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/903398/\" id=\"a_12\">section 482</a>, Cr. P.C. by the High Court\non the ground that what was involved between the bank and the accused was\nonly a civil liability for which the bank had filed a civil suit.\nPadmanabhan, J, expressed reservations of the view taken by the High Court\nbut still viewed that the earlier order of the High Court may hold good, in\nso far as the allegation of cheating the bank was concerned, but it would\nnot affect the prosecution case of forgery by using forged documents and\ncheating for the purpose of facilitating export by use of forged documents\nas genuine.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">It would be worthwhile to extract paragraph 18 of his judgment under\nappeal, which is as follows :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">&quot;18, It is true that the allegation is one affecting the image of the\nGovernment of India and the two responsible agencies, namely, E.I.A. and\nM.P.E.D.A. So also the matter was seriously taken up through the Indian\nEmbassy. But that does not mean, as argued for the defence, that the C.B.I.\nand the official witnesses of the customs, E.LA, and M.P.E.D.A. were\ninterested in fabricating a false case or false evidence. I do feel that a\nmore serious probe from the C.B.I. was necessary to pursue the availability\nof the original of Ex, P.9, But the evidence sufficiently discloses its\nnon-availability for reasons not very clear from the evidence. Any how the\ncircumstances indicate that the accused must have had a hand in it though\nthe object could have been achieved only with the connivance of some of the\nemployees of the E.IA. The investigation of this case is certainly not one\nwhich is capable of adding anything to the image of the C.B.I. The missing\nof the two sheets from the printed book in the possession of P.W.5 and the\nseal of P.W3 which facilitated the forgery of Ex.P9 would have been\nachieved only if some of the employees either actively or passively\nconnived. That aspect has not been satisfactorily investigated. But the\nlaches in that respect has not in any way affected the conclusion that\nEx,P15 and the original of Ex,P9 are fabrications and forgeries. It is true\nthat the prosecution was not able to establish as to who forged these\ndocuments. Any how the only possible conclusion is that forgeries could\nhave been only by or at the instance of the accused and they were used with\nthe full knowledge that they are forgeries,&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">The learned Judge farther observed in paragraph 41 as follows :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">&quot;.......... From the evidence of the Customs officials it is seen that the\noriginal of Ex.P9 was presented and that shipping was allowed only because\nthey had no reason to suspect its veracity. When both these items of\nevidence are taken together the inevitable conclusion is that by the\nproduction of the QCC the customs officials were actually deceived and\ninduced to permit export of the goods. That is the only inference possible.\nI do not think that it is necessary to stand on the technicality of\ninsisting on an item of evidence from the concerned witnesses that but for\nthe deceit or fraudulent or dishonest inducement, they would not have\npermitted export. The gist of the prosecution evidence is that is the only\npossible in-ference also from the evidence. Therefore in disagreement with\nthe counsel, I come to the conclusion that the prosecution evidence is\ncapable of establishing an offence of cheating as against the first\naccused. The first accused is therefore found guilty of having committed\noffences punishable under<a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_13\"> ss. 420</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_14\">471</a> of the Indian Penal Code.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">On close scrutiny of the above views of the High Court, the least we can\nsay is that its approach, and that too in an appeal against acquittal, was\nhighly wanting. The prosecution had a long distance to travel between &quot;what\nmay be true&quot; and &quot;what must be true&quot;. In the absence of the original of\nEx.P9 and P15 being produced at the trial, which as many as four\nprosecution witnesses admit were available with the Customs, how could a\ncase of forgery be built up on their photostat copies, punishable under\n<a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_15\">section 471</a> of the Indian Penal Code and the sequal offence under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_16\">Section\n420</a> I.P.C.? How could in such state of evidence and vacillating views, as\nrecorded by the High Court, be the basis of the conviction of the appellant\nsingularly and substantively, when originally he was not charged for such\noffences, but with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_17\">section 120-B</a> I.P.C.? Having acquitted the\nother two accused of the charge of conspiracy for commission of these\noffences, how could the High Court take the appellant to have been charged\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 471</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_19\">420</a> I.P.C. and not spell out a case of prejudice to\nhim leading to mis-carriage of justice? In our view, the High Court over\nlooked these important matters and rather over-simplified the issue. Eves\nthough it has observed that the approach of the Chief Judicial Magistrate\nhad made its job difficult, necessitating a lengthy discussion for the\npurpose of arriving at a conclusion, the emphasised parts of the judgment,\nabove extracted, disclose that the High Court was not sure, as to who and\nwhich of the accused had committed the forgery and having done so, it could\nnot have attributed necessary means rea for the user of such forged\ndocument as genuine to the appellant alone, so as to bring him within the\ngrip of <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_20\">section 471</a> I.P.C. or <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 420</a> I.P.C. Thus we take the view that\nthe High Court was wrong in upsetting the correct judgment and order passed\nby learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Ernakulam. We thus no hesitation to\nrestore it. Accordingly, this appeal is allowed and the judgment and order\nof the High Court is set aside restoring the acquittal of the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">CRL. APPEAL NOS. 653-55 OF 1989 AND 652 OF 1989:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">These appeals by Mrs. V. Sujatha need a neat and formal disposal. We have\nallowed Criminal Appeal arising out of S.L.P. (Crl.) No. 180 of 1989 and\nCriminal Appeal No. 625 of 1988. In both the upset judgments of Padnamahan,\nJ. adverse remarks have been made against Mrs. V. Sujatha, the appellant\nherein. Those judgments of the High Court do not remain operative and the\njudgments and orders passed by her in both cases have been restored. The\nadverse remarks in a sense are no longer legally tenable or existing, but\nthey do stay written in court records all the same, In the special leave\npetitions before us, certain new facts have been sought to be introduced by\nSmt. V. Sujatha vis-a-vis Padmanabhan, J.. We do not, for cause of\npropriety, since Padmanabhan, J. is not a party before us, wish to make\nmention thereof in these proceedings, except to state that it is suggestive\nthat at one point of time, apparently cordial relations existed between the\ntwo. We are told at the Bar that both of them have since retired. It has\nbeen lamented by learned counsel for Mrs. V. Sujatha that her career&#x27;s was\nspoiled by such adverse remarks, which remarks the Press blew up beyond\nproportions to tarnish her image and name. Be that as it may, this will not\nprompt us to do the exercise of culling out and reproducing herein the\nadverse remarks, from the upset judgment of Padmanabhan, J. or to reproduce\nherein her grievances in the special leave petitions and record them in\nthis judgment, again for sake of propriety, for we must bury an bury deep\nthe harsh and unnecessary provocative language employed in these documents.\nBut before we do that, we do need to say what already has been said by this\nCourt time and again, for judges to employ mellow and temperate language in\ntheir judgments, when referring to members of the judicial family. Some of\nthese case are as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"345238\" id=\"span_1\">(<a href=\"/doc/345238/\" id=\"a_22\">i) Ishwari Prasad Mishra v. Mohammad Isa</a>, [1963] 3 SCR 722 at page 723 and\npp. 745-748.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">&quot;In the present case the HC has used intemperate language and has even gone\nto the length of suggesting a corrupt motive against the judge who decided\nthe suit in favour of the appellant. In our opinion, the use of such\nintemperate language may, in some cases, tend to show either a lack of\nexperience in judicial matters or an absence of judicial poise and\nbalance.....No doubt, if it is shown that the decision of the Trial Court\nin a given case is the result of a corrupt motive, the HC must condemn it\nand take further steps in the matter. But the use of strong language and\nimputation of corrupt motives should not be made light heartedly because\nthe judge against whom imputations are made has no remedy in law to\nvindicate his position.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1139693\" id=\"span_2\">(<a href=\"/doc/1139693/\" id=\"a_23\">ii) H.Lyngdoh v. Crornfyn Lyngdoh</a>, [1971] 1 SCC 754 at p.757.</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">&quot;Before we part with the case, we were distressed to note certain personal\nremarks made by the learned Chief Justice against one of the Hon&#x27;blc judges\nof that court. To us these remarks do not appear to be cither proper or\njust. By making these remarks the learned Chief Justice has let down his\noffice as well as his court. In the objective discharge of judicial\nfunction there is little jus-tification nay, none-at-all to assume any\nattitude other than of judicial restraint or to use a language while\nreferring to one&#x27;s colleagues, other than that which has been hitherto\nadopted by long usage.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"320843\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"564691\" id=\"span_4\">(iii) Such restraint was due even for parties or their witnesses as seen in\n<a href=\"/doc/564691/\" id=\"a_24\">A.M. Mathur v. Pramod Kumar Gupta &amp; Ors.</a>, [1990] 2 SCC 533, referring to\nthe decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/320843/\" id=\"a_25\">State of M.P. v. Nandlal Jaiswal</a>, [ 1986] 4\nSCC 566 where Bhagwati, CJI Speaking for the Court had observed:</span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">&quot;We may observe in conclusion that judges should not use strong and carping\nlanguage while criticizing the conduct of parties or their witnesses. They\nmust act with sobriety, moderation and restraint. They must have the\nhumility to recognize that they are not infallible and any harsh and\ndisparaging strictures passed by them against any party may be mistaken and\nunjustified and is so they may do considerable harm and mischief and result\nin injustice.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">Cases need not be multiplied on the point.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">Therefore, one of the main principles is that a judge should take special\ncare in making disparaging remarks against a judge of a subordinate court\nor against a person or authority whose conduct comes in for con-sideration\nbefore him in cases to be decided by him. Making uncalled for remarks\nagainst the said persons or authorities would be violation of judicial\ndiscipline,&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">Reverting back to the merits, the appellant, Mrs. V. Sujatha, in the first\ninstance needs to be reminded that she was harsh on the judicial Magistrate\nin Gopalan Nair&#x27;s case and the remark made against him, rightly caught up\nby the High Court, was totally uncalled for. That remark of hers in her\njudgment, even though restored, would stand deleted. All the harsh and\nadverse remarks made against her by the High Court in Gopalan Nair&#x27;s case\nwould stand deleted and reference to her in derogatory terms shall be taken\nto have been pulled out. Her application for expunction of remarks which\nwas declined to be withdrawn by the High Court would stand allowed. As a\nresult, the orders passed thereon for declination and all orders passed\nthereafter shall be taken to have been withdrawn. This will have the effect\nof allowing Criminal Appeals Nos. 653-55/89, likewise, harsh and adverse\nremarks and references made to Mrs. V. Sujatha in the judgment of the High\nCourt in R. Vikraman&#x27;s shall be taken to have been pulled out and expunged,\nThose judgments of the High Court be read from that angle and in that\nlight. Criminal appeal No. 652 of 1989 would also stand allowed\naccordingly.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">To sum up, all these six appeals are allowed. Gopalan Nair in Criminal\nAppeal No. 621/94 arising out of S.L.P. (Crl). 180 of 1989 stands\nacquitted, R. Vikraman in Crl. Appeal No. 625 of 1988 stands acquitted. All\nthe adverse remarks in the form of harsh and derogatory language employed\nagainst Mrs. V. Sujatha by the High Court in its two upset orders would\nstand pulled out and expunged. Criminal Appeals Nos. 652-89 and 653-55/89\nwould thus stand allowed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">This disposes of the six appeals.\n</blockquote>","numcites":12,"numcitedby":18,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":1968197,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"section 420 ipc","formInput":"section%20420%20ipc"},{"value":"adverse remarks","formInput":"adverse%20remarks"},{"value":"forgery","formInput":"forgery"},{"value":"brakes failure","formInput":"brakes%20failure"},{"value":"section 420","formInput":"section%20420"},{"value":" 420 ipc","formInput":"%20420%20ipc"},{"value":"forged documents","formInput":"forged%20documents"},{"value":"Bell foods","formInput":"Bell%20foods"},{"value":"\"cheating\" ","formInput":"%22cheating%22%20"},{"value":"\"section 420\" \"indian penal code\"","formInput":"%22section%20420%22%20%22indian%20penal%20code%22"},{"value":" special leave petition","formInput":"%20special%20leave%20petition"},{"value":"section 471","formInput":"section%20471"},{"value":"mechanical defect ","formInput":"mechanical%20defect%20"},{"value":"ipc 471","formInput":"ipc%20471"},{"value":"motor vehicles inspector","formInput":"motor%20vehicles%20inspector"},{"value":"337 ipc","formInput":"337%20ipc"},{"value":"indian penal code section 420 IPC","formInput":"indian%20penal%20code%20section%20420%20IPC"},{"value":"indian penal code 420","formInput":"indian%20penal%20code%20420"},{"value":"471 of indian penal code","formInput":"471%20of%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"slp","formInput":"slp"}],"cats":[{"value":"theft","formInput":"tag:theft"},{"value":"forged-document","formInput":"tag:forged-document"},{"value":"criminal-conspiracy","formInput":"tag:criminal-conspiracy"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
