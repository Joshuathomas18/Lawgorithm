The short facts of the case are that, Deepaben d/o\nthe first informant chandrashekhar Sukhram got married\nwith the appellant No.1 as per the caste customs and rites\non 13.12.2006 and since then Deepaben was staying at\nher matrimonial home along with the accused persons. It\nis the prosecution case that the accused persons were\ntaunting her by saying that her parents were beggars and\nthey have not given anything in marriage. Regarding the\nhouse-hold matter in a petty matter they used to criticize\nand thereby causing mental and physical harassment. It\nis also alleged that by way of dowry, a demand was made\nof Splendor Motorcycle and the amount of Rs.2.00 lacs\nwas demanded for purchasing a shop and house repairing.\nFor bringing dowry, they used to pressurize her and also\ncausing mental and physical harassment. As a result, on\n3.5.2007 at abut 10 a.m. Deepaben committed suicide by\nsetting her ablaze. The appellant No.2 removed her to the\nhospital after extinguishing the fire, where the treatment\nwas given and at 12.30 p.m. she was declared dead by the\nDoctors.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">2.1. The first informant Chandrashekhar Shukhram P.W.5\nExh.28 lodged his FIR at Bapunagar Police Station.         He\nwent to the Police Station for lodging the FIR and he was\naccompanied by all his sons.

Number\nhas been mentioned.               In all probability it becomes clear\nthat the offence would not have been registered by that\ntime and subsequently at a belated stage the FIR was\nlodged.

Learned APP has also pressed into service decision in\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/475531/\" id=\"a_33\">Bani Singh &amp; Ors. vs. State of U.P.</a> [AIR\n1996 SC 2339 (1)] whereby it is held in paragraphs 14,\n15, 16 and 17 as under:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">    &quot;14. We             have    carefully      considered    the     view\n    expressed in the said two decisions of this Court\n    and, we may state that the view taken in Shyam\n    Deo&#x27;s case appears to be sound except for a minor\n    clarification         which     we      consider     necessary         to\n    mention. The plain language of Section 385 makes\n    it clear that if the Appellate Court does not\n    consider the appeal fit for summary dismissal, it\n    &#x27;must&#x27;        call    for   the    record      and   Section      386\n    mandates that after the record is received, the\n    Appellate Court may dispose of the appeal after\n    hearing the accused or his counsel. Therefore, the\n    plain language of Sections 385-386 does not\n    contemplate dismissal of the appeal for non-\n    prosecution simplicitor. On the contrary, the Code\n    envisages disposal of the appeal on merits after\n    perusal and scrutiny of the record. The law clearly\n    expects the Appellate Court to dispose of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                   Page 12 of 27</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\"> R/CR.A/1564/2009                                        CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nappeal on merits, not merely by perusing the\nreasoning of the trial court in the judgment, but by\ncross-checking the reasoning with the evidence on\nrecord with a view to satisfyiny itself that the\nreasoning and findings recorded by the trial court\nare consistent with the material on record. The\nlaw, therefore, does not envisage the dismissal of\nthe appeal for default or non-prosecution but only\ncontemplates disposal on merits after perusal of\nthe record. Therefore, with respect, we find it\ndifficult to agree with the suggestion in Ram\nNaresh Yadav&#x27;s case that if the appellant or his\npleader is not present, the proper course would be\nto dismiss an appeal for non-prosecution.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">15.     Secondly, the law expects the Appellate\nCourt to give a hearing to the appellant or his\ncounsel, if he is present, and to the public\nprosecutor, if he is present, before disposal of the\nappeal on merits. Section 385 posits that if the\nappeal is not dismissed summarily, the Appellate\nCourt shall cause notice of the time and place at\nwhich the appeal will be heard to be given to the\nappellant          or   his   pleader.        Section    386     then\nprovides that the Appellate Court shall, after\nperusing the record, hear the appellant or his\npleader, if he appears. It will be noticed that\nSection 385 provides for a notice of the time and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                              Page 13 of 27</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\"> R/CR.A/1564/2009                                 CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nplace of hearing of the appeal to be given to either\nthe appellant or his pleader and not to both\npresumably because notice to the pleader was\nalso       considered     sufficient     since     he     was\nrepresenting the appellant. So also Section 386\nprovides for a hearing to be given to the appellant\nor his lawyer, if he is present, and both need not\nbe heard. It is the duty of the appellant and his\nlawyer to remain present on the appointed day,\ntime and place when the appeal is posted for\nhearing. This is the requirement of the Code on a\nplain reading of Sections 385-386 of the Code. The\nlaw does not enjoin that the Court shall adjourn\nthe case if both the appellant and his lawyer are\nabsent. If the Court does so as a matter of\nprudence or indulgence, it is a different matter,\nbut it is not bound to adjourn the matter. It can\ndispose of the appeal after perusing the record\nand the judgment of the trial court. We would,\nhowever, hasten to add that if the accused is in jail\nand cannot, on his own, come to court, it would be\nadvisable to adjourn the case and fix another date\nto       facilitate     the       appearance       of      the\naccused/appellant if his lawyer is not present. If\nthe lawyer is absent, and the court deems it\nappropriate to appoint a lawyer at State expense\nto assist it, there is nothing in the law to preclude\nit from doing so. We are, therefore, of the opinion\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                         Page 14 of 27</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\"> R/CR.A/1564/2009                                    CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\nand we say so with respect, that the Division\nBench which decided Ram Naresh Yadav&#x27;s case\ndid not apply the provisions of Sections 385-386 of\nthe Code correctly when it indicated that the\nAppellate Court was under an obligation to adjourn\nthe case to another date if the appellant or his\nlawyer remained absent.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">16.     Such a view can bring about a stalemate\nsituation. The appellant and his lawyer can remain\nabsent with impunity, not once but again and\nagain till the Court issues a warrant for the\nappellant&#x27;s presence. A complaint to the Bar\nCouncil against the lawyer for non-appearance\ncannot result in the progress of the appeal. If\nanother lawyer is appointed at State cost, he too\nwould need the presence of the appellant for\ninstructions and that would place the Court in the\nsame situation. Such a procedure can, therefore,\nprove cumbersome and can promote indiscipline.\nEven if a case is decided on merits in the absence\nof the appellant, the higher court can remedy the\nsituation is there has been a failure of justice. This\nwould        apply   equally    if       the   accused   is   the\nrespondent for the obvious reason that if the\nappeal cannot be disposed of without hearing the\nrespondent or his lawyer, the progress of the\nappeal would be halted.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                         Page 15 of 27</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">      R/CR.A/1564/2009                                  CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">6.2.
