This application of the Appellant was strongly resisted by NIA\n\nand also by the Intervenor, namely, the father of the deceased, who\n\nhas died in the bomb-blast at Malegaon. The Special Court, after\n\nhearing learned counsel for the parties and after satisfying itself\n\nfrom the material on record, was pleased to reject the said\n\napplication of the Appellant vide its impugned order and, hence, the\n\ninstant Appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_35\">20.    While challenging the impugned order passed by the Special\n\nCourt, the submission of learned counsel for the Appellant Shri.\n\nShivade is that, in view of the Supplementary Report filed by NIA,\n\ndropping the charges in respect of the offences under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_50\">MCOC Act</a>, it\n\nhas to be held that there is no prima facie case against the\n\nAppellant. It is submitted by him that in the earlier orders, the\n\nAppellant&#x27;s applications for bail were rejected mainly on the basis of\n\nthe confessional statements of co-accused Nos.7, 10 and 12. Those\n\nconfessional statements were recorded under the provisions of\n\n                                12                 APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017             ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:04 :::</span>\n <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_51\">MCOC Act</a>. Now, as the charges under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_52\">MCOC Act</a> are dropped, those\n\nconfessional statements of co-accused are required to be excluded\n\nfrom consideration and in absence thereof, there is no incriminating\n\nmaterial against the Appellant so as to deny him the benefit of bail.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">21.    Secondly, it is submitted that in the earlier orders of rejecting\n\nhis Bail Applications, reliance was also placed on the statements of\n\nPW-55, PW-79 and PW-112, as recorded by ATS. However, in the\n\ninvestigation conducted by NIA, PW-79 and PW-112 have changed\n\ntheir previous versions by retracting, before the NIA and\n\nMetropolitan Magistrate at Delhi, their statements recorded by ATS\n\nand before Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai. PW-55 has also made\n\ncomplaint regarding harassment and torture by the officers of ATS\n\nto the Human Rights Commission and, thus, he has also, in effect,\n\nretracted his previous statement made before the ATS officer. Thus,\n\naccording to the Appellant, this fact that these three co-accused and\n\nthree material witnesses have retracted their statements recorded\n\nby the ATS officers, clearly indicate that the investigation carried\n\nout by ATS was not fair, but it was tainted. They have extracted the\n\nstatements and confessions by subjecting the witnesses and co-\n\naccused to the torture and duress, under the threats of implicating\n\n\n\n                                13                   APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017               ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:04 :::</span>\n them falsely. Now, in view of the withdrawal of those statements and\n\nconfessions, there remains nothing on record to implicate the\n\nAppellant with the alleged offences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_37\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_38\">22.    Appellant has further contended that he was illegally detained\n\nby ATS officers and the officer of the Army by name Col. Srivastav,\n\nthough, both, the ATS officers and the Army officer were fully aware\n\nthat Appellant had participated in the meetings held at various\n\nplaces like Faridabad, Bhopal, etc., in discharge of his duties as a\n\n&#x27;Military Intelligence Officer&#x27; for collecting intelligence and creating\n\nnew sources. The said fact has also been revealed in the Report of\n\nCourt of Inquiry conducted by the Army Officers against him as well\n\nas in the reply filed by the Ministry of Defence and the documents\n\nfiled by the said Ministry in the Special Court. According to the\n\nAppellant, isolated sentences uttered by him, during the course of\n\nconversations in the said meetings or thereafter, cannot be used\n\nagainst him, in view of the fact that he was discharging his duties as\n\n&#x27;Military Intelligence Officer&#x27; to create intelligence sources. It is his\n\nfurther contention that there was no sufficient material to show that\n\nin the said meetings, any conspiracy was hatched to commit the\n\nbomb-blast at Malegaon.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_40\">                                14                   APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017               ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:05 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\"> 23.    In this respect, learned counsel for the Appellant has also\n\ndrawn attention of this Court to the statement of PW-21, who has\n\nstated that, immediately after the alleged conspiracy meeting, he\n\nfound the Appellant disclosing details of the meeting to his superiors\n\nin Military Intelligence. On inquiry by him, Appellant also told him\n\nthat it was a &#x27;covert operation&#x27; of Military Intelligence. According to\n\nlearned counsel for Appellant, secrecy being the soul of conspiracy,\n\nno conspirator will ever divulge the details of the conspiracy to the\n\nsuperior officers in Military Intelligence. The statements of PW-94\n\nand PW-150 are also pointed out in that direction. It is urged that\n\nthe documents of the Court of Inquiry conducted by the Ministry of\n\nDefence and which are brought on record, as per the order of the\n\nSpecial Court itself, were clearly ignored by the learned Special\n\nCourt on the count that they will be considered at the time of trial.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">24.    It is submitted by learned counsel for Appellant that, the\n\nReport of Inquiry also reveals that the RDX was planted by ATS\n\nofficer in the house of Accused No.11-Sudhakar Chaturvedi. There\n\nare statements to that effect of PW-180 and PW-183, recorded by\n\nNIA and, accordingly, NIA has also, after thorough investigation,\n\n\n\n                                15                   APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017               ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:05 :::</span>\n disbelieved the story of ATS, that of RDX traces found in the house\n\nof Accused No.11-Sudhakar Chaturvedi. According to learned\n\ncounsel for the Appellant, the Trial Court has, however, ignored\n\nthese statements of witnesses and also the investigation conducted\n\nby the NIA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_44\">25.     Learned counsel for the Appellant has then also challenged the\n\napplicability of <a href=\"/doc/165949346/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 43-D(5)</a> of UAP Act contending, inter alia,\n\nthat it has no retrospective effect, as it affects the substantive right\n\nof Accused to get bail. Hence, according to him, restriction on the\n\npower of the Court in allowing the bail, as laid down under <a href=\"/doc/165949346/\" id=\"a_54\">Section\n\n43-D(5)</a> of the UAP Act, cannot be made applicable to the present\n\ncase.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_45\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_46\">26.     The learned counsel for the Appellant has further challenged\n\nthe sanction granted for prosecution of Appellant under <a href=\"/doc/5268862/\" id=\"a_55\">Section\n\n45(1)</a> of UAP Act. It is contended that the Trial Court has erred in\n\nholding that the question of validity of sanction and possibility of\n\nfailure of prosecution under <a href=\"/doc/1389751/\" id=\"a_56\">UAP Act</a> on the ground of invalid\n\nsanction cannot be considered at the stage of deciding the\n\napplication for bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_47\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_48\">                                16                   APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017               ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:05 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\"> 27.    Lastly, learned counsel for the Appellant has submitted that\n\nthe Appellant is in Jail since last about eight years and the delay is\n\nsheerly on account of the prolonged time taken by the Investigating\n\nAgencies, for which the Appellant is not responsible at all. As on\n\ntoday also, the charges are not framed in this case. It is submitted\n\nthat there are five hundred witnesses cited by the prosecution and\n\nthousands of documents have been filed on record. There are, in all,\n\ntwelve accused having separate Advocates. Even the arguments on\n\nDischarge Application are likely to take few months and, thus, it is\n\nimpossible to commence the trial for several months. Naturally, it\n\nwill take few more years to complete the trial. Appellant has already\n\nundergone minimum sentence provided for the offences alleged\n\nagainst him. Appellant has no criminal antecedents whatsoever. His\n\nservice record is clean and he is considered as an asset to the Army.\n\nIt is, therefore, submitted by learned counsel for Appellant that, it is\n\nhigh time that Appellant should be released on bail; especially when\n\nthere is no possibility of his absconding. His old mother, wife and two\n\nminor sons have been deprived of his company. The offences alleged\n\nagainst him are not punishable with death and there is also no prima\n\nfacie case in support of the charges. The charge of criminal\n\nconspiracy is well-nigh impossible to be proved by the prosecution\n\n\n\n                                17                   APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017               ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:05 :::</span>\n and, thus, it is submitted that this is a fit case where the Appellant\n\ndeserves to be released on bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_50\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_51\">28.    According to learned counsel for Appellant, as learned Special\n\nCourt has not considered all these facets of the case and failed to\n\nappreciate the submissions advanced by the learned counsel for the\n\nAppellant, the impugned order rejecting the Bail Application of the\n\nAppellant needs to be set aside by allowing this Appeal.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_52\">29.    Per contra, learned Special P.P. for NIA, Mr. Sandesh Patil, has\n\nstrongly controverted these submissions of learned counsel for the\n\nAppellant by contending, inter alia, that all these contentions of the\n\nlearned counsel for the Appellant are properly considered by the\n\nSpecial Court and by giving elaborate, detailed and cogent\n\nreasoning, the Special Court has rejected the Bail Application of the\n\nAppellant. It is further submitted that, in the earlier Bail\n\nApplications also, it was held that, prima facie, there is sufficient\n\nmaterial to implicate the Appellant, he being the main conspirator.\n\nAccording to learned Special P.P. for NIA, there is no substantial\n\nchange in the said circumstances. It is submitted that, merely\n\nbecause the MCOC charges are dropped, it does not mean that there\n\nis no material against the Appellant in respect of other charges also.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_53\">                                18                  APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:05 :::</span>\n According to learned Special P.P., though NIA has given &#x27;clean-chit&#x27;\n\nto Accused No.1-Pragya Singh Thakur and some other co-accused, it\n\nhas not exonerated the Appellant from the charges levelled against\n\nhim. It clearly reflects that NIA has also found sufficient material to\n\nimplicate the Appellant. It is submitted that all the contentions\n\nraised by the Appellant as to the non-applicability of <a href=\"/doc/165949346/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 43-D(5)</a>\n\nof UAP Act or want of valid sanction for the prosecution can be\n\ndefinitely considered at the time of trial and not at this stage.\n\nPresently, the conclusions about involvement of the Appellant in the\n\noffences alleged against him, as drawn by ATS officers, are\n\nsupplemented and supported by NIA officers also in its detailed\n\ninvestigation. Thus, it is urged that, having regard to the gravity and\n\nseriousness of the offences, which were in the nature of waging a\n\nwar against the unity and integrity of Nation, and, that too, by\n\nviolent means, Bail Application of the Appellant could not have been\n\nallowed and it is rightly rejected by the Special Court.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_54\">30.

It may be true that\n\nthereafter again it was rejected, but in the Appeal preferred against\n\nthe said order, the Appellant was permitted to file fresh Bail\n\nApplication. Thus, according to learned counsel for the Appellant,\n\nthe first Bail Application of Appellant, which was filed before 31 st\n\nDecember 2008, is yet not finally decided and in view thereof, the\n\neffect of this amended stringent provision of <a href=\"/doc/165949346/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 43-D(5)</a> of UAP\n\nAct cannot be made applicable to Appellant&#x27;s Bail Application.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_60\">34.

The question involved in the said case was, &#x27;as to whether the\n\nAmendment Act No.43 of 1993 is retrospective in operation?&#x27; . By\n\nthe said Amendment, clause (b) of sub-section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/16437130/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 20</a> of\n\nTADA Act was amended, thereby reducing the maximum period\n\nduring which an accused under TADA can be kept in custody\n\npending investigation from one year to 180 days. The Amendment\n\nAct also introduced clause (bb) to sub-section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/16437130/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 20</a> of\n\nTADA Act, thereby enabling the prosecution to seek extension of\n\ntime for completion of investigation.

No doubt, these two conditions are in addition to the conditions\n\nlaid down under the Code on granting of bail; however, these\n\nconditions, in our considered opinion, do not, in any way, affect or\n\nrestrict the right, if any, of the Appellant to be released on bail. Even\n\nwhile deciding the Bail Application of the Accused, as per the\n\nprovisions of the Code, Public Prosecutor is heard and, secondly,\n\nunder the provisions of the Code also, the Court always ensures as to\n\nwhether the accusation against the accused person is prima facie\n\ntrue.

Moreover, in this case, admittedly, the offences alleged against\n\nthe Appellant are non-bailable and punishable with imprisonment\n\nfor life or death, as he is also charged for the offences under Section\n\n302, 120B etc. of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_88\">IPC</a>. Therefore, under the provisions of the Code\n\nalso, it cannot be said that the Appellant has any substantive right\n\nto be released on bail, similar to the right the accused is having in\n\nthe case of bailable offences.

Even otherwise\n\nalso, whether the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/165949346/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 43-D(5)</a> of UAP Act are\n\napplied to the Bail Application of the present Appellant or not, the\n\nfact remains that this Court has to consider his Bail Application\n\naccording to the provisions of the Code and the provisions of the\n\nCode also mandate that the offences alleged against the Appellant\n\nbeing non-bailable, the Court has to consider his Bail Application on\n\ncertain parameters, which are <a href=\"/doc/244079/\" id=\"a_101\">laid down in</a> the various authorities\n\nof the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court, like, the prima facie case appearing\n\nagainst the Appellant; the nature of the offence; the gravity of the\n\n\n\n                                34                   APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017               ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:05 :::</span>\n punishment; the possibility of Applicant tampering of the witnesses,\n\nif released on bail, etc. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has also in its order\n\ndated 15th April 2015 directed the Bail Application of the Appellant\n\nand other co-accused to be decided on these parameters.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_111\">                    Applicability of MCOCA Provisions\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_112\">57.    At this stage, it may also be necessary to consider the\n\napplicability of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_102\">MCOC Act</a> to the present case.\n\nAccording to learned counsel for the Intervenor, though NIA has\n\ndropped the charges under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_103\">MCOC Act</a>, Accused in\n\nthe case, including the Appellant, cannot be discharged from the\n\nsaid offences, as already this Court has taken cognizance of the case\n\nunder the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_104\">MCOC Act</a>. According to learned counsel for\n\nthe Intervenor, even in the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\n\ndated 15th April 2015 passed in Criminal Appeal No.1169-1970 of\n\n2010, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has, though raised doubt about the\n\napplicability of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_105\">MCOC Act</a>, to the present\n\nAppellant and other co-accused are concerned, except Accused No.7-\n\nRakesh Dhawde, these accused are not discharged from the offences\n\nregistered under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_106\">MCOC Act</a>. In such circumstances, according to\n\nhim, no clean-chit can be given to the Appellant or other co-accused\n\nfrom the offences registered under the <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_107\">MCOC Act</a>.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_113\">                                35                 APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017             ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:05 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_114\"> 58.    It is further submitted by learned counsel for the Intervenor\n\nthat, at this stage, when the investigation conducted by the ATS,\n\nimplicating the accused with the offences under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_108\">MCOC Act</a> and the\n\ninvestigation conducted by NIA stand side by side, they have to be\n\nread conjointly. It is, therefore, submission of learned counsel for\n\nthe Intervenor that the confessional statements of Accused Nos.7,\n\n10 and 12 are required to be considered, along with other material\n\non record, while deciding prima facie case of the prosecution against\n\nthe Appellant for the purpose of deciding his Bail Application. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"194120\" id=\"span_44\">In\n\nsupport of this submission, learned counsel for the Intervenor, has\n\nrelied upon the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/194120/\" id=\"a_109\">State of Tamil Nadu Vs.

This submission of learned counsel for the Intervenor is\n\nstrongly controverted by learned counsel for the Appellant on the\n\ncount that, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has already expressed doubts\n\nabout the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_110\">MCOC Act</a> to these Accused and now the\n\nclean-chit is given by NIA by dropping those charges under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_111\">MCOC Act</a> against all the Accused. Hence, according to him, there is\n\nno question of this Court taking into consideration the confessional\n\n\n\n                                36                 APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017             ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:05 :::</span>\n statements of Accused Nos.7, 10 and 12, which could have been\n\nadmissible only if the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_112\">MCOC Act</a> were applicable.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">60.    In our considered opinion, in order to appreciate these rival\n\nsubmissions, this Court has to consider the observations made by\n\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the above referred Judgment dated 15 th\n\nApril 2015 passed in Criminal Appeal No.1969-1970 of 2010,\n\nagainst the order passed by this Court. In these Appeals, Appellant\n\nand other Accused, including Accused No.1-Pragya Singh Thakur,\n\nhad challenged the very applicability of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_113\">MCOC Act</a>\n\nto the present case and while deciding the said issue raised for its\n\nconsideration, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court was pleased to observe in\n\nparagraph No.95 of its Judgment as follows :-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_117\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       95.     In the light of our above conclusions on the various\n               submissions, we are convinced that in respect of the\n               appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1971 of 2010,\n               namely, A-7, there is no scope even for the limited\n               purpose of <a href=\"/doc/945595/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 21(4)(b)</a> to hold that application of\n               <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_115\">MCOC Act</a> is doubtful. We have held that the said\n               appellant A-7 had every nexus with all the three\n               crimes, namely, Parbhani, Jalna and Malegaon and,\n               therefore, the bar for grant of bail under <a href=\"/doc/945595/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 21</a>\n               would clearly operate against him and there is no\n               scope for granting any bail.

There is considerable doubt about their\n               involvement in Parbhani and Jalna and, therefore,\n               they are entitled for their bail applications to be\n               considered on merits.&quot;              [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\">61.    It may be true that Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has not dropped the\n\ncharges under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_118\">MCOC Act</a>, but it appears to be so, as investigation by\n\nNIA at that time was in progress. Hence, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has\n\nnot dropped the charges of MCOC against the Appellant and other\n\nco-accused. However, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has clearly raised a\n\nconsiderable doubt about the applicability of those charges and has\n\ndirected that so far as the Bail Applications of the present Appellant\n\nand other co-accused, except Accused No.7-Rakesh Dhawde, are\n\nconcerned, they should be decided on their own merit. This\n\nobservation of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court could be further found in\n\nparagraph No.98 of its judgment, wherein the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\n\nset aside the orders of rejection of the bail of the Appellant by\n\nholding that there is enough scope to doubt as to the application of\n\n\n                                 38                       APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:05 :::</span>\n <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_119\">MCOC Act</a> under <a href=\"/doc/945595/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 21(4)(b)</a> for the purpose of grant of bail\n\nand, accordingly, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court directed the Special Judge\n\nto consider their application for bail on merits, keeping in mind the\n\nlaw <a href=\"/doc/194120/\" id=\"a_121\">laid down in</a> the reported authorities, which were referred in\n\nparagraph Nos.96 and 97 of the Judgment, and directed to pass the\n\norders accordingly. Thus, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has made the\n\nthings very clear by directing that the Bail Application of the\n\npresent Appellant is to be decided on merits, without considering the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_122\">MCOC Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_119\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_120\">62.

Hence, there has to be joint trial of\n\nAccused       and      the      co-accused,        who   have      made        confessional\n\nstatements        under         <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_137\">MCOC        Act</a>.   Hence,    at    this      stage,       these\n\n                                       41                         APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                            ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:05 :::</span>\n observations of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court cannot be of any help to\n\nlearned counsel for the Intervenor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_129\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_130\">67.    Secondly and most importantly, the observations made by\n\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the Appeal preferred by the Appellant are\n\nvery clear and categorical to the effect that the Bail Applications of\n\nthe Appellant and other co-accused are to be decided on their own\n\nmerits, excluding the applicability of the <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_138\">MCOC Act</a>. Hence, at this\n\nstage, we deem it proper not to enter into the controversy or\n\nprejudge the issue, &quot;as to whether the confessional statements of the\n\nco-accused can be taken into consideration for deciding the charges\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_139\">IPC</a>, even if Accused are acquitted under TADA or <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_140\">MCOC Act</a>&quot;,\n\nespecially when the trial and applications for discharge filed by the\n\nAccused are pending before the Special Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_131\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_132\">68.    Admittedly, in this case, the confessional statements of co-\n\naccused were recorded as the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_141\">MCOC Act</a> were invoked\n\nand once those provisions are not to be considered for the purpose of\n\ndeciding this Bail Application, as per the order of Hon&#x27;ble Apex\n\nCourt, then, to be on safer side, it would be proper on our part to\n\nexclude those confessional statements from our consideration while\n\ndeciding this Appeal, as was rightly done by the Special Court.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\">                                42                 APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017             ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:05 :::</span>\n Moreover, in our opinion, even if those confessional statements of\n\nco-accused are excluded from consideration, still there is more than\n\nsufficient material on record to infer prima facie case against the\n\npresent Appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_134\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_135\">                                Validity of Sanction\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_136\">69.    Before adverting to the facts of this case, it is necessary to\n\nconsider one more leg of the argument advanced by learned counsel\n\nfor Appellant and it pertains to the &#x27;sanction&#x27; for prosecution of the\n\nAppellant. According to learned counsel for the Appellant, the\n\nsanction accorded in this case is not legal and valid for two reasons;\n\nthe first reason being, the State Government had no power to accord\n\nsanction under <a href=\"/doc/5268862/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 45(2)</a> of UAP Act and, secondly, the\n\nSanctioning Authority of the State Government did not follow the\n\nmandatory provisions laid under <a href=\"/doc/5268862/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 45(2)</a> of the UAP Act.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_137\">70.    Per contra, according to learned Special P.P. and learned\n\ncounsel for the Intervenor, the question of validity of sanction\n\ncannot be gone into at this stage, as it needs to be decided at the time\n\nof final hearing and, secondly, the sanction granted by the State\n\nGovernment was valid one and it cannot be said that by way of\n\n\n                                    43                   APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:05 :::</span>\n amendment dated 31st December 2008, this authority of the State\n\nGovernment was taken away.

We are, however, not inclined to accept this submission as the\n\nplain reading of <a href=\"/doc/5268862/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 45(1)(ii)</a> of UAP Act shows that, so far as\n\nthe offences under Chapters IV and VI of the UAP Act are concerned,\n\nthe cognizance can be taken only if there was previous sanction of\n\nthe Central Government, or, as the case may be, of the State\n\nGovernment.

Therefore, what follows from the discussion of above decisions\n\nis that, it depends upon the nature of objection raised to the\n\nSanctioned Order as to when it can be decided. In this respect, one\n\ncan safely place reliance on the Judgment of our own High Court in\n\nAnil Sadashiv Nanduskar Vs. State of Maharashtra, Laws (Bom) -\n\n2007-11-96, cited by learned counsel for Intervenor. In this case,\n\nthe &#x27;sanction&#x27; granted under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 21A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/83726174/\" id=\"a_171\">23(2)</a>\n\nof the MCOC Act was challenged on the ground that concerned\n\nauthorities had not applied the mind properly. It was contended that\n\nthe letter of approval did not disclose the material placed before the\n\nSanctioning Authority and the Sanction Order, ex-facie, did not\n\ndisclose that the concerned authority has considered as to whether\n\nthe Appellant was member of the alleged syndicate involved in\n\ncommission of the offence. While dealing with these submissions,\n\nafter taking into consideration the law laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nApex Court in various authorities, the Division Bench of this Court\n\nwas pleased to observe as follows :-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_167\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">                                55                  APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n            &quot;The settled law by a catena of decisions of Apex Court\n           is to the effect that it is desirable that every order\n           whether the approval or sanction, it should speak for\n           itself, i.e. ex-facie, it should disclose consideration of\n           the materials placed before it and application of mind\n           thereto. However, failure to reproduce or refer those\n           recitals in the resolution or order itself would not\n           render the order of approval or sanction to be invalid\n           unless the prosecution fails to establish by leading\n           evidence that all the materials necessary for the grant\n           of approval or sanction were placed before the\n           concerned authority for due application of mind by\n           such authority before the grant of approval and or\n           sanction. It apparently discloses that question of\n           validity of approval or sanction cannot be decided\n           unless the prosecution is afforded opportunity to lead\n           evidence in that regard. Undoubtedly, an accused\n           desiring to raise objection regarding the defects in\n           such approval or sanction, or, grant, he can raise such\n           objection; however, for conclusive decision on the said\n           point, the accused has to wait till the trial is complete\n           and on that ground, he cannot insist for discharge\n           unless the objection relates to inherent lack of\n           jurisdiction to the concerned authority to grant\n           sanction or approval and such issue can be decided on\n           undisputed facts. The law being well settled to the\n           effect that the prosecution in a case where sanction or\n           the     approval    order   does   not   ex-facie       show\n           consideration of all the materials and/or application of\n           mind, is entitled to establish the same by leading\n           necessary evidence regarding production of materials\n\n                                 56                      APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n             before the concerned authority, the question of\n            discharge of accused merely on the basis of such\n            objection being raised cannot arise. The decision on\n            the point of defect, if any, in the order of approval or\n            sanction will have to be at the conclusion of the trial.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">                                               [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_169\">89.    In view of this settled position of law, in our opinion, in the\n\ninstant case also, merely because there is no reference to the report\n\nof the Reviewing Authority in the Sanction Order, at this stage, this\n\nCourt cannot come to the conclusion that the review report was not\n\nconsidered by the Sanctioning Authority and, hence, the &#x27;sanction&#x27; is\n\ninvalid. Whether Sanctioning Authority has considered such report\n\nor not can be decided only after the Sanctioning Authority is given\n\nan opportunity to state so, at the time of trial. Hence, at this stage,\n\nthis contention raised by learned counsel for the Appellant\n\nchallenging the sanction order cannot be accepted.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_170\">         Factual Aspects of this Case qua the Appellant\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\">90.    In this case it is a matter of record that this is the third Bail\n\nApplication of the Appellant.

No doubt, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has restored the said Bail\n\nApplication for a fresh decision in the light of the doubt expressed by\n\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court about the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_172\">MCOC Act</a>, but, it is\n\na matter of record that, after decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court also,\n\nthe    Appellant&#x27;s         Bail   Application   (Exhibit-2295),           with       Bail\n\nApplication No.42 of 2008, came to be rejected by the Special Court.\n\nThe Appeal preferred against the same, bearing Criminal Appeal\n\nNo.138 of 2016, came to be withdrawn by the Appellant in view of\n\nthe report filed by NIA, under Section 173(8) of the Code.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_172\">91.    This Bail Application is, therefore, mainly on the ground of\n\nchange in circumstance, as NIA has dropped the charges under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_173\">MCOC Act</a> against all the Accused, including the present Appellant.\n\nIt is urged that, as a consequence to dropping of charges under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_174\">MCOC Act</a>, the confessional statements of co-accused cannot be\n\ntaken into consideration. Moreover, some material prosecution\n\nwitnesses have, in investigation by NIA, retracted their statements\n\nrecorded by ATS. Thus, the main emphasis of the Appellant for\n\nseeking bail is now on the investigation conducted by NIA and, in\n\n\n\n                                   58                      APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                     ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n addition to that, on the Report of the Court of Inquiry conducted\n\nagainst him by the Ministry of Defence, which, according to the\n\nAppellant, prima facie, show that he has participated in the\n\nmeetings as &#x27;Military Intelligence Officer&#x27; in discharge of his duties,\n\nto create counter intelligence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">\n\n  Re-investigation / Further Investigation Carried Out by NIA\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_174\">92.

The Report\n\nfiled by NIA reveals that NIA is not in agreement with the\n\ninvestigation done by ATS on certain points, but, at the same time,\n\nNIA has accepted the investigation done by ATS on several other\n\naspects of the matter. NIA has recorded the statements of some\n\nmore witnesses and re-recorded the statements of the witnesses\n\nalready examined by ATS. NIA has also exonerated some of the\n\n\n                                59                  APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n Accused, like, Accused No.1-Pragya Singh Thakur, Accused No.2-\n\nShivnarayan Kalsangra, Accused No.3-Shyam Sahu, Accused No.12-\n\nPraveen Takkalki, Accused No.15-Lokesh Sharma and Accused\n\nNo.16-Dhan Singh Choudhary, of all the charges levelled against\n\nthem.

Mr. Desai, the learned Senior Counsel for the intervenor in\n\nthis regard vehemently argued that fresh / re-investigation can be\n\nundertaken at the instance of the higher Courts only. He submitted\n\nthat whatever investigation is carried out by the NIA is without\n\nauthority from higher Courts and therefore it is illegal.

In this case one of the question\n\nwhich fell for consideration before the Apex Court was, &#x27;whether CBI\n\nis empowered to conduct fresh investigation / re-investigation when\n\ncognizance has already been taken by the Court of competent\n\njurisdiction on the basis of a police report under section 173 of the\n\nCode?&#x27; The Apex Court thus observed in paragraph 45 :</span>\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                                60                  APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n          &quot;45.

If one examines\n               the provisions of the Code, there is no specific\n               provision for cancellation of the reports, except that\n               the investigating agency can file a closure report\n               (where according to the investigating agency, no\n               offence is made out). Even such a report is subject to\n               acceptance by the learned Magistrate, who, in his\n               wisdom, may or may not accept such a report.

In such circumstances, the first and foremost question arising\n\nfor consideration is, &#x27;what can be the effect of further investigation\n\nconducted by NIA on the earlier investigation done by the ATS?&#x27; and\n\n&#x27;when there are more than two or more investigations conducted by\n\nthe same or different agencies, what can be the effect?&#x27;                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"84627277\" id=\"span_81\">In our\n\nconsidered opinion, the answer to this question is clearly found in\n\nthe landmark decision of <a href=\"/doc/84627277/\" id=\"a_181\">Vinay Tyagi Vs.

It was held by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the said case that\n\nneither the Investigating Agency has power to conduct such fresh /\n\nde novo investigation / re-investigation, nor the Magistrate has\n\npower to direct the same. Only the higher judiciary, in exercise of\n\nextra-ordinary or inherent jurisdiction, has power to direct such\n\nfresh / de novo investigation or re-investigation by the same or any\n\nother specialized agency.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_185\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_186\">98.

It was further held that, if\n\nno such specific order is passed in regard to the prior investigation /\n\nreport, the same remains the part of the record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_187\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_188\">99.    In this reported authority, initial investigation was carried out\n\nand primary report was filed by Delhi Police. Further investigation\n\nby CBI was directed by High Court of Delhi, whereon Closure Report\n\nwas filed by CBI. While directing the investigation by CBI, High Court\n\nhas not passed any order or direction staying further investigation\n\nby Delhi Police or striking out from record the primary report filed\n\nby the Delhi Police. In the light of the same, it was held that, once the\n\nHigh Court has not passed any specific order regarding fate of\n\ninvestigation already conducted and the report filed by Delhi Police,\n\nthen there is no question of treating first report or primary report as\n\nbeing withdrawn, cancelled or capable of being excluded from\n\nrecords by implication. It was, accordingly, held that, the Trial Court\n\nhas to consider the entire record including, both, the Delhi Police\n\nReport filed under Section 173(2) of the Code, as well as Closure\n\nReport filed by CBI and the documents filed along with these two\n\nreports. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has further held that, the Trial\n\nCourt has three options. Firstly, it may accept application of the\n\n\n\n                                64                   APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017               ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n accused for discharge; secondly, it may direct that the trial may\n\nproceed further in accordance with law; and, thirdly, if it is\n\ndissatisfied on any important aspect of investigation already\n\nconducted and in its considered opinion, it is just, proper and\n\nnecessary in the interest of justice to direct &quot;further investigation&quot;,\n\nit may do so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_189\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_190\">100. In paragraph No.22 of its Judgment, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\n\nwas pleased to consider the effect of further investigation carried\n\nout under Section 173(8) of the Code by observing that,\n\n\n            &quot;Significant feature of further investigation is that it\n            does not have the effect of wiping out directly or\n            impliedly the initial investigation conducted by the\n            Investigating Agency. This is a kind of continuation of\n            the previous investigation. The basis is discovery of\n            fresh evidence and in continuation of the same offence\n            and chain of events relating to the same occurrence\n            incidental thereto. In other words, it has to be\n            understood in complete contradistinction to a &quot;re-\n            investigation&quot;, &quot;fresh&quot;, or, &quot;de novo&quot; investigation.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_191\">                                                 [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_192\">101. However, as regards the fresh investigation or re-investigation\n\nor de novo investigation, it was held that,\n\n\n\n                                 65                       APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n             &quot;There has to be a definite order of the Court and such\n            order should unambiguously state as to whether the\n            previous investigation, for reasons to be recorded, is\n            incapable of being acted upon. Neither the Investigating\n            Agency nor the Magistrate has any power to order or\n            conduct &quot;fresh investigation&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_193\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_194\">102.

According to the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court, such power of ordering\n\n&quot;fresh&quot; or &quot;de novo&quot; investigation needs to be exercised by the\n\nhigher judiciary, sparingly and in the rarest of rare case. In\n\nparagraph No.45 of the Judgment, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court was\n\npleased to observe as follows :-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_196\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">         &quot;45. The power to order/direct &quot;reinvestigation&quot; or &quot;de\n               novo&quot; investigation falls in the domain of higher\n               courts, that too in exceptional cases. If one examines\n               the provisions of the Code, there is no specific\n               provision for cancellation of the reports, except that\n               the investigating agency can file a closure report\n               (where according to the investigating agency, no\n\n\n                                66                       APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n                offence is made out). Even such a report is subject to\n               acceptance by the learned Magistrate, who, in his\n               wisdom, may or may not accept such a report. For\n               valid reasons, the Court may, by declining to accept\n               such a report, direct &quot;further investigation&quot;, or even\n               on the basis of the record of the case and the\n               documents annexed thereto, summon the accused.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_197\">                                                              [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_198\">104. In paragraph No.46, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court was further\n\npleased to hold as follows :-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_199\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">       &quot;46. ............................................. The superior courts can\n               direct conduct of a &quot;fresh&quot;/&quot;de novo&quot; investigation,\n               but unless it specifically directs that the report\n               already          prepared        or   the   investigation        so     far\n               conducted will not form part of the record of the case,\n               such report would be deemed to be part of the record.\n               Once it is part of the record, the learned Magistrate\n               has no jurisdiction to exclude the same from the\n               record of the case. In other words, but for a specific\n               order by the superior court, the reports, whether a\n               primary           report        or    a   report     upon       &quot;further\n               investigation&quot; or a report upon &quot;fresh investigation&quot;,\n               shall have to be construed and read conjointly. Where\n               there is a specific order made by the court for reasons\n               like the investigation being entirely unfair, tainted,\n               undesirable or being based upon no truth, the court\n               would        have     to        specifically     direct      that       the\n               investigation or proceedings so conducted shall stand\n\n                                          67                           APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                                 ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n                cancelled and will not form part of the record for\n               consideration by the court of competent jurisdiction.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_200\">                                                    [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_201\">105. Ultimately, in paragraph No.53 of its Judgment, the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nApex Court specifically answered Question No.1, which was\n\nformulated for its consideration, &#x27;as to which report to be considered\n\nby the Magistrate when there are more than one investigation&#x27; , as\n\nfollows :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       &quot;53. The court of competent jurisdiction is duty-bound to\n               consider all reports, entire records and documents\n               submitted therewith by the investigating agency as\n               its report in terms of Section 173(2) of the Code. This\n               rule is subject to only the following exceptions :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">               (a)      Where a specific order has been passed by the\n                        learned Magistrate at the request of the\n                        prosecution limited to exclude any document or\n                        statement or any part thereof;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">               (b)      Where an order is passed by the higher courts\n                        in exercise of its extra-ordinary or inherent\n                        jurisdiction directing that any of the reports i.e.\n                        primary report, supplementary report or the\n                        report submitted on &quot;fresh investigation&quot; or\n                        &quot;re-investigation&quot; or any part of it be excluded,\n                        struck off the court record and be treated as\n                        non est.&quot;                   [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n\n\n\n                                    68                       APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                       ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_202\"> 106. Thus, perusal of this Judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\n\nmakes it more than crystal clear that, even if &quot;fresh&quot; / &quot;de novo&quot; or\n\n&quot;re-investigation&quot; is carried out by different agency, the earlier\n\ninvestigation report is not wiped out from the record, in the absence\n\nof any specific order passed by the higher court to that effect, while\n\nordering such &quot;fresh&quot; / &quot;de novo&quot; or &quot;re-investigation&quot;. As a result,\n\nthe Court has to consider and read conjointly, both, the earlier\n\nreport and also the subsequent report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_203\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_204\">107. In the instant case, the investigation done earlier by ATS,\n\ntherefore, cannot be said to be wiped out totally from the record\n\nmerely because, subsequently, NIA has carried out fresh / de novo or\n\nre-investigation. Admittedly, the NIA has not undertaken such\n\n&quot;further&quot;, &quot;fresh&quot; / &quot;de novo&quot;, or, re-investigation on the basis of or\n\nin pursuance of any order passed by the higher judiciary, but NIA\n\nhas done so under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/51260634/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 6(5)</a> of the NIA Act,\n\nwhich empowers the Central Government to suo-motu direct the\n\ninvestigation by NIA, if the Central Government is of the opinion\n\nthat a scheduled offence has been committed. Therefore, as\n\ninvestigation was directed by Central Government, there was no\n\nquestion of higher judiciary making any specific order that the\n\nearlier report of investigation carried out by ATS or any part thereof\n\n                                69                  APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n was to be excluded or struck-off the record and to be treated as non\n\nest. In such situation, both, the report of the investigation filed by\n\nATS and also the report of investigation filed by NIA are required to\n\nbe considered and read conjointly to decide whether any prima facie\n\ncase exists against the Appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_205\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_206\">108. It is pertinent to note that, in the above said authority, even\n\nwhen the application was for discharge of the Accused, in view of the\n\nClosure Report filed by CBI, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court was pleased to\n\nhold, in paragraph No.58, that,\n\n\n            &quot;The application for discharge filed by the accused on\n            the strength of such closure report filed by CBI has to be\n            decided after examining the entire record, including the\n            report filed by Delhi Police under Section 173(2) of the\n            Code.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_207\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_208\">109.

It is further submitted by learned counsel for the Intervenor\n\nthat, at this stage, when the investigation conducted by the ATS,\n\nimplicating the accused with the offences under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_189\">MCOC Act</a> and the\n\ninvestigation conducted by NIA stand side by side, they have to be\n\nread conjointly. It is, therefore, submission of learned counsel for\n\nthe Intervenor that the confessional statements of Accused Nos.7,\n\n10 and 12 are required to be considered, along with other material\n\non record, while deciding prima facie case of the prosecution against\n\nthe Appellant for the purpose of deciding her Bail Application. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"194120\" id=\"span_91\">In\n\nsupport of this submission, learned counsel for the Intervenor, has\n\n                                72                 APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017             ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n relied upon the judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/194120/\" id=\"a_190\">State of Tamil Nadu Vs.

This submission of learned counsel for the Intervenor is\n\nstrongly controverted by learned counsel for the Appellant on the\n\ncount that, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has already expressed doubts\n\nabout the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_191\">MCOC Act</a> to these accused and now the\n\nclean-chit is given by NIA by dropping those charges under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_192\">MCOC Act</a> against all the Accused. Hence, according to him, there is\n\nno question of this Court taking into consideration the confessional\n\nstatements of Accused Nos.7, 10 and 12, which could have been\n\nadmissible only if the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_193\">MCOC Act</a> were applicable.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_219\">116. In our considered opinion, in order to appreciate these rival\n\nsubmissions, this Court has to consider the observations made by\n\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the above referred Judgment dated 15 th\n\nApril 2015 passed in Criminal Appeal No.1969-1970 of 2010,\n\nagainst the order passed by this Court. In these Appeals, Appellant\n\nand Accused No.9-Prasad Purohit had challenged the very\n\napplicability of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_194\">MCOC Act</a> to the present case and\n\nwhile deciding the said issue raised for its consideration, the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n\n\n                                73                  APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n Apex Court was pleased to observe in paragraph No.95 of its\n\nJudgment as follows :-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_220\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">       95.     In the light of our above conclusions on the various\n               submissions, we are convinced that in respect of the\n               appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1971 of 2010,\n               namely, A-7, there is no scope even for the limited\n               purpose of <a href=\"/doc/141161782/\" id=\"a_195\">Section 21(4)(b)</a> to hold that application of\n               <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_196\">MCOC Act</a> is doubtful. We have held that the said\n               appellant A-7 had every nexus with all the three\n               crimes, namely, Parbhani, Jalna and Malegaon and,\n               therefore, the bar for grant of bail under <a href=\"/doc/135076042/\" id=\"a_197\">Section 21</a>\n               would clearly operate against him and there is no\n               scope for granting any bail. Insofar as the rest of the\n               appellants are concerned, for the purpose of invoking\n               <a href=\"/doc/141161782/\" id=\"a_198\">Section 21(4)(b)</a>, namely, to consider their claim for\n               bail, it can be held that for the present juncture with\n               the available materials on record, it is not possible to\n               show any nexus of the appellants who have been\n               proceeded against for their involvement in Malegaon\n               blast with the two earlier cases, namely, Parbhani and\n               Jalna. There is considerable doubt about their\n               involvement in Parbhani and Jalna and, therefore,\n               they are entitled for their bail applications to be\n               considered on merits.&quot;              [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">117. It may be true that Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has not dropped the\n\ncharges under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_199\">MCOC Act</a>, but it appears to be so, as investigation by\n\nNIA at that time was in progress.

However, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has clearly raised a\n\nconsiderable doubt about the applicability of those charges and has\n\ndirected that so far as the Bail Applications of the present Appellant\n\nand other co-accused, except Accused No.7-Rakesh Dhawde, are\n\nconcerned, they should be decided on their own merit. This\n\nobservation of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court could be further found in\n\nparagraph No.98 of its judgment, wherein the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\n\nset aside the orders of rejection of the bail of the Appellant therein,\n\nnamely, Prasad Purohit, by holding that there is enough scope to\n\ndoubt as to the application of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_200\">MCOC Act</a> under <a href=\"/doc/141161782/\" id=\"a_201\">Section 21(4)(b)</a> for\n\nthe purpose of grant of bail and, accordingly, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\n\ndirected the Special Judge to consider their application for bail on\n\nmerits, keeping in mind the law <a href=\"/doc/194120/\" id=\"a_202\">laid down in</a> the reported\n\nauthorities, which were referred in paragraph Nos.96 and 97 of the\n\nJudgment, and directed to pass the orders accordingly. In the said\n\nparagraph itself, it was directed that the bail application of the\n\npresent Appellant is also restored to the file of the learned Special\n\nJudge for passing orders on merit. The Appellant herein was, thus,\n\nalso held entitled for the same relief, as was granted to the Appellant\n\ntherein, of consideration of her application for grant of bail. Thus,\n\n\n\n                                75                  APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has made the things very clear by directing\n\nthat the Bail Application of the present Appellant is to be decided on\n\nmerits, without considering the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_203\">MCOC Act</a>.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_222\">118.

According to learned counsel\n\nfor the Intervenor, the order of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court nowhere\n\nreflects that, while deciding the Bail Application of the Appellant,\n\nconfessional statements of co-accused should be excluded from\n\nconsideration. According to learned counsel for Intervenor, further\n\nobservations made by Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in paragraph No.96 make\n\nit clear that the Bail Applications of Appellant and other co-accused\n\n                                76                 APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017             ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n were to be decided not on the touch-stone of <a href=\"/doc/135076042/\" id=\"a_207\">Section 21(b)</a> of MCOC\n\nAct, but on its own merits, as the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has then\n\nreferred to the parameters for granting bail, as <a href=\"/doc/194120/\" id=\"a_208\">laid down in</a> the\n\nlandmark decisions of State of U.P., through CBI, Vs.

Nalini and Ors.\n\n(Supra</a>), it is necessary to refer to those observations also. In this\n\ncase it was held that,\n\n\n            &quot;Even if the accused persons, at the end of trial, are\n            acquitted for the offences under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_211\">MCOC Act</a>, still the\n            confessional        statements   of   co-accused      can      be\n            considered and relied upon for the purpose of the\n            offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_212\">IPC</a>.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_226\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_227\">121.

In our considered opinion, at this stage, this point should not\n\ndetain us for long, because the observations of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of State of Tamil Nadu vs. Nalini (Supra) make it\n\nclear that the question of considering the confessional statements of\n\nco-accused, recorded under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_215\">MCOC Act</a> for the purpose of the offences\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_216\">IPC</a>, arises only if the accused persons, at the end\n\nof trial, are acquitted of the charges under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_217\">MCOC Act</a>. The material\n\nwords are &#x27;at the end of the trial&#x27; . Hence, there has to be joint trial of\n\nAccused       and      the      co-accused,        who   have      made        confessional\n\nstatements        under         <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_218\">MCOC        Act</a>.   Hence,    at    this      stage,       these\n\nobservations of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court cannot be of any help to\n\nlearned counsel for the Intervenor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_231\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_232\">123. Secondly and most importantly, the observations made by\n\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the Appeal preferred by the Appellant are\n\nvery clear and categorical to the effect that the Bail Applications of\n\n                                       78                         APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                            ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:06 :::</span>\n the Appellant and other co-accused are to be decided on their own\n\nmerits, excluding the applicability of the <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_219\">MCOC Act</a>.

As to the first piece of material, relied upon by prosecution,\n\naccording to the Appellant, there is nothing in the transcriptions of\n\nthe conversation in the meetings to show that he and co-accused\n\nhatched the criminal conspiracy to commit bomb-blast at Malegaon.\n\nIt is his further submission that in the said meetings, the persons\n\n\n                                 87                       APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:07 :::</span>\n present have expressed their general opinion about the then\n\nprevailing political and social situation. Moreover, the Report of the\n\nCourt of Inquiry as well as the documents filed by the Ministry of\n\nDefence and even the statement of PW-121 show that Appellant had\n\ninformed the details of these meetings to his superiors, as he has\n\nattended the said meetings to create the counter intelligence. It is\n\nurged that these documents clearly destroy the theory of\n\nprosecution that Appellant was present in these meetings as a\n\nconspirator. It is further urged that none of the absconding accused,\n\nwho have allegedly committed the Malegaon bomb-blast, were\n\nparticipants in the meetings or that they were communicated by the\n\nAppellant about what was transpired in the said meetings. Thus, it is\n\nsubmitted that there is absolutely no connection between the\n\nMalegaon bomb-blast and these meetings, as there is no common\n\nthread running through the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_256\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_257\">132. As regards the Call Detail Record, it is submitted that there are\n\nno calls exchanged between the absconding accused, who had\n\nallegedly caused Malegaon bomb-blast, and the Appellant at any\n\ntime during the period of conspiracy, though, in the normal course,\n\nthere would have been increase in frequency of calls between them,\n\n\n\n                                88                 APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017             ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:07 :::</span>\n at-least, at the fag-end of the conspiracy; particularly, if the\n\nAppellant was the principle conspirator, as alleged by the\n\nprosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_258\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_259\">133. As to the intercepted telephonic conversation, on which the\n\nprosecution has placed reliance, it is urged that the object of\n\nconspiracy, as per the prosecution case, was to commit Malegaon\n\nbomb-blast on 29th September 2008. The ATS has, however, without\n\nany reason extended the period of conspiracy from January 2008\n\ntill 23rd October 2008. It is submitted that once the object of\n\nconspiracy is achieved, the offence of conspiracy comes to an end\n\nand the prosecution has, thus, not explained as to why the period of\n\nconspiracy is extended upto 23rd October 2008, when the bomb-blast\n\nhad taken place on 29th September 2008. There is no evidence to\n\nshow that any acts were done by the accused during this period from\n\n29th September 2008 till 23rd October 2008. The alleged phone calls\n\nbetween the Appellant and Accused No.4-Ramesh Upadhyay show\n\nthat they were merely trying to take precautions so as to guard the\n\nrole of &#x27;Military Intelligence&#x27; because of international ramifications.\n\nIt is urged that there is no evidence to show that prior to the date of\n\nbomb-blast or subsequent to it, the Appellant was in touch with any\n\n\n\n                                89                  APEAL-664-16-Prasad Purohit.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:50:07 :::</span>\n other conspirators. In fact, the statement of PW-105 shows that\n\nAppellant was, at the relevant time, at Panchmadhi. Thus, the main\n\ncontention of the Appellant in respect of these two pieces of\n\nevidence,       namely,         transcriptions   of   the      meetings          and       the\n\nintercepted telephonic conversation between the Appellant and co-\n\naccused, is that the Appellant had attended these meetings as a part\n\nof his duty and that was the reason why he has reported about the\n\nsame to his superior officers, otherwise he would not have done so.\n\nFor substantiating this submission, the learned counsel for\n\nAppellant has relied upon the documents filed by the Ministry of\n\nDefence and the papers of the Court of inquiry.

In this respect, one can also place reliance on the Judgment of\n\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of State of Orissa Vs. Devendranath\n\nPadhi, AIR 2005 SC 359.

This\n\nconversation also reflects that Appellant was under pressure and\n\ntension when he came to know that Accused No.1-Pragya Singh was\n\narrested. In this conversation, Appellant also talked about the need\n\nfor changing of his phone number and also the need of engaging the\n\nAdvocate. In the further telephonic conversation, Appellant and\n\nAccused No.4-Ramesh Upadhyay instructed each other to be more\n\ncareful as they were under apprehension of being on radar of the\n\nPolice. NIA has also, in paragraph Nos.13 and 14 of its Report,\n\nconfirmed these facts and this post-conduct of Appellant, prima\n\nfacie, shows the guilt in his mind and his active participation in\n\ncrime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_305\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_306\">158.

The next consideration for deciding the application for bail is\n\n&#x27;the nature and gravity of the charge&#x27; . In the instant case, it is\n\nneedless to state that the charge levelled against the Appellant is\n\nserious and grave one. It is of waging war against the integrity and\n\nunity of the State and, that too, by the violent means like exploding\n\nthe bomb, so as to create terror in the minds of the people. The\n\nbomb-blast has caused not only the loss of lives of 6 persons, but also\n\nmore than 100 people were injured. The offences alleged against the\n\nAppellant are, therefore, punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_279\">Sections 302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_280\">307</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_281\">326</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_282\">324</a>, <a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_283\">427</a>, <a href=\"/doc/345634/\" id=\"a_284\">153A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_285\">120B</a> of IPC, r/w. <a href=\"/doc/1056565/\" id=\"a_286\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/895566/\" id=\"a_287\">4</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1335368/\" id=\"a_288\">5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1539301/\" id=\"a_289\">6</a> of ES\n\nAct r/w. <a href=\"/doc/1092263/\" id=\"a_290\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1601096/\" id=\"a_291\">5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_292\">25</a> of the Arms Act. Therefore, even if the\n\noffences under the <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_293\">MCOC Act</a> are excluded from consideration, the\n\ngravity of the charges levelled against the Appellant cannot be\n\nignored.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_339\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_340\">174.
