The fundamental\n\nright guaranteed is the manifestation of a long struggle by\n\nthe mankind for human rights. A similar guarantee is to be\n\nfound in almost all civilised societies governed by rule of\n\nlaw. The well known maxim `nemo delset bis vexari pro\n\neadem causa&#x27; embodies the well established common law\n\nrule that no one should be put on peril twice for the same\n\noffence.   BLACKSTONE referred to this universal maxim of\n\nthe common law of England that no man is to be brought\n\ninto jeopardy of his life more than once for the same\n\noffence.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                                              18</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">15.

If a person is charged again\n\nfor the same offence, he can plead, as a complete defence,\n\nhis former conviction, or as it is technically expressed, take\n\nthe plea of autrefois convict. This in essence is the common\n\nlaw principle. The corresponding provision in the American\n\nConstitution is enshrined in that part of the Fifth Amendment\n\nwhich declares that no person shall be subject for the same\n\noffence to be twice put in jeopardy of life or limb.      The\n\nprinciple has been recognised in the existing law in India and\n\nis enacted in <a href=\"/doc/87754/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 26</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/741791/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 300</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code, 1973. This\n\nwas the inspiration and background for incorporating sub-\n\nclause (2) into <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 20</a> of the Constitution. But the ambit\n\nand content of the guaranteed fundamental right are much\n\nnarrower than those of the common law in England or the\n\ndoctrine of `double jeopardy&#x27; in the American Constitution.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                                                        19</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">16. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1815080\" id=\"span_18\">In <a href=\"/doc/1815080/\" id=\"a_67\">Maqbool Hussain vs. The State of Bombay1</a>, this\n\nCourt explained the scope of the right guaranteed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/17858/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 20 (2)</a> and as to what is incorporated in it as &quot;within\n\nits scope the plea of autrefois convict as known to                   the\n\nBritish jurisprudence or the plea of double jeopardy as it\n\nknown to the American Constitution but circumscribed it by\n\nproviding that there should be not only a prosecution but\n\nalso a punishment in the first instance in order to operate as\n\na bar to a second prosecution and punishment for the same\n\noffence.&quot;            That in order for the protection of <a href=\"/doc/17858/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 20 (2)</a>\n\nto be invoked by a person there must have been a\n\nprosecution and as well as punishment in respect of the\n\nsame offence before a court of law of competent jurisdiction\n\nor a tribunal, required by law to decide the matters in\n\ncontroversy judicially on evidence.

If, however, the two\n       offences are distinct, then notwithstanding that\n       the allegations of fact in the two complaints\n       might be substantially similar, the benefit of\n       the ban cannot be invoked.

There was\n\nanother prosecution against the accused for the conspiracy\n\nto lift the funds of another company, though its object was\n\nto cover the fraud committed in respect of the Jupiter\n\ncompany. This Court held that the defalcations made in the\n\nJupiter may afford a motive for new conspiracy, but the two\n\noffences are distinct ones. Some accused may be common\n\nto both of them, &quot;some of the facts proved to establish the\n\nJupitor conspiracy may also have to be proved to support\n\nthe motive for the second conspiracy.        The question is\n\nwhether that in itself would be sufficient to make the two\n\nconspiracies the one and the same offence. The ingredients\n\nof both the offences are totally different and do not form the\n\nsame offence within     the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/17858/\" id=\"a_84\">Article 20 (2)</a> of the\n\nConstitution and, therefore, that Article has no relevance.&quot;\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">6</span>\n    AIR 1965 SC 682\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">\f                                                                      25</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">18. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"170445\" id=\"span_34\">In <a href=\"/doc/170445/\" id=\"a_85\">State of Rajasthan vs. Hat Singh &amp; Ors.7</a>, this\n\nCourt held that the <a href=\"/doc/160312812/\" id=\"a_86\">Rajasthan Sati (Prevention) Act, 1987</a>\n\nprovided            for    different   offences   and   punishment   for\n\nglorification of sati and for violation of prohibitory order\n\nagainst glorification of sati.

Shri K.T.S. Tulsi, learned senior counsel in the present\n\ncase before us mainly contended that the facts        based on\n\nwhich the appellant (Monica Bedi) was prosecuted and\n\npunished by a competent court of jurisdiction at Lisbon and\n\nthe facts based on which prosecution has been initiated\n\nresulting in conviction are the same and, therefore, the\n\nconviction of the appellant is in the teeth of <a href=\"/doc/17858/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 20 (2)</a> of\n\nthe Constitution and <a href=\"/doc/741791/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 300</a> of the      Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure.    The submission is not well founded for the\n\nsimple reason that the same set off facts can constitute\n\noffences under two different laws.     An act or an omission\n\ncan amount to and constitute an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_95\">IPC</a> and at\n\nthe same time constitute an offence under any other law. It\n\nneeds no restatement that the bar to the punishment to the\n\noffender twice over for the same offence      would arise only\n\nwhere the ingredients of both the offences are the same.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                                                            28</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_41\">22. The question that falls for our consideration is, whether\n\nthe appellant can be said to have satisfied all the conditions\n\nthat are necessary to enable her to claim the protection of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/17858/\" id=\"a_96\">Article 20 (2)</a> of the Constitution. The charges upon which\n\nthe appellant has been convicted now, for the charges under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_97\">Indian Penal Code</a>, we will presume for our present\n\npurpose that the allegations upon which these charges are\n\nbased, proved, resulting in conviction and punishment of the\n\nappellant are substantially the same which formed the\n\nsubject matter of prosecution and conviction under the penal\n\nprovisions of Portugal law. But we have no doubt to hold\n\nthat the punishment of the appellant is not for the same\n\noffence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">23. Be that as it may, there is no factual foundation laid as\n\nsuch by the appellant taking this plea before the trial court.\n\nNothing is suggested to the Investigating Officer or to any of\n\nthe witnesses that she is sought to be prosecuted and\n\npunished for the same offence for which she has been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">\f                                                           29</span>\n\n\ncharged and convicted by a competent court of jurisdiction\n\nat Lisbon. She did not even make any such statement in her\n\nexamination under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C.     It is true that the\n\nfundamental right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/17858/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 20 (2)</a> of the\n\nConstitution is in the nature of an injunction against the\n\nState prohibiting it to prosecute and punish any person for\n\nthe same offence more than ones but the initial burden is\n\nupon the accused to take the necessary plea and establish\n\nthe same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">24.

The\n       test is whether the former offence and the\n       offence now charged have the same ingredients\n       in the sense that the facts constituting the one\n       are sufficient to justify a conviction of the other,\n       not that the facts relied on by the Crown are the\n       same in the two trials (f). &quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">25.

The\n\nConstitutional   Court     while       considering     the     issue    of\n\nextradition of the appellant and the nature of the trial\n\nundergone by her in Portugal observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">       [*]\n\n        &quot;It is a fact that the appellant has been trialled\n        in Portugal for committing an offence provided\n        and punishable under <a href=\"/doc/76145/\" id=\"a_100\">article 256</a> of the penal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">\f                                                           31</span>\n\n\n       code.

The simple case of the prosecution is that all the\n\nappellants entered into a conspiracy in order to secure a\n\npassport in the assumed name of Sana Malik Kamal, for the\n\nbenefit of Monica Bedi so as to enable her to utilize the same\n\nto leave the country and travel abroad.        There is    no\n\ncontroversy whatsoever that Monica Bedi travelled abroad\n\non the strength of the passport secured by her in the\n\nassumed name. She entered Portugal with the aid of\n\npassport standing in the name      of Sana Malik Kamal for\n\nwhich she has to face the prosecution and suffer conviction\n\nand sentence in Portugal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">29. It is evident from the record that the involvement of\n\nthe appellants is at two stages. Stage one is where Monica\n\nBedi (A-3) and Mohd. Yunis (A-7) are involved in the pre-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">\f                                                           36</span>\n\n\npassport application at the threshold and even before the\n\npreparation of application seeking the passport in the\n\nassumed name. Stage two is the involvement of Monica Bedi\n\n(A-3), Shaik Abdul Sattar (A-5) and D. Gokari Saheb (A-8)\n\nafter the submission of passport application before the\n\nauthorities. Exhibit P2 is the passport application submitted\n\nin the assumed name of Sana Malik Kamal which contains\n\nthe   photograph   of   Monica   Bedi   (A-3).      Essential\n\nrequirements for obtaining the passport are: (1) passport\n\napplication; (2) proof of residence and (3) date of birth\n\ncertificate as spoken to by PWs. 2, 3, 21 and 31. How these\n\ndocuments are obtained for the benefit of Monica Bedi has\n\nbeen clearly brought on record through a number of\n\nwitnesses whose evidence remained unimpeached. It is\n\nMohd. Yunis (A-7), the Mandal Revenue Inspector who\n\nverified the residence particulars of Sana Malik Kamal on the\n\ninstructions of PW-5, Mandal Revenue Officer, Kurnool and\n\nsubmitted a false verification report based on which exhibit\n\nP9 residence certificate was issued by PW-5.      PW-17 on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">\f                                                             37</span>\n\n\nrequisition from C.B.I officials once again got verified and\n\nissued exhibit P30 certificate to the effect that no person by\n\nname Sana Malik Kamal resides in the house as earlier\n\nsubmitted by Mohd. Yunis (A-7). PW-37 is the Investigating\n\nOfficer who in his evidence stated that he verified the\n\nparticulars of occupants of the said house in the presence of\n\nPW-27 (D.V. Ratnamaiah), Assistant Superintendent of Post\n\nOffices, Kurnool   and found no such person named Sana\n\nMalik Kamal    ever resided     therein. It is based on this\n\nevidence the trial court and appellate court came to the right\n\nconclusion that the prosecution established its case that it is\n\nMohd. Yunis (A-7) who gave false verification based on\n\nwhich exhibit P9 residence certificate was issued by PW-5 in\n\nthe name of Sana Malik Kamal. The trial court convicted\n\nMohd. Yunis (A-7)    for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 468</a> IPC\n\nwhich reads as under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">       &quot;468.

The High Court came to the               conclusion    that in\n\nsubmitting   the   false   verification   report   in   respect   of\n\nresidence of Sana Malik Kamal he may not have been aware\n\nand knew that the certificate so obtained would be used for\n\nthe purpose of securing the passport in the assumed name\n\nof Sana Malik Kamal. At any rate there is no evidence on\n\nthat aspect of the matter. The High Court also came to the\n\nconclusion that by the time Mohd. Yunis (A-7) submitted a\n\nfalse verification there is nothing       on record that he was\n\nhand in glove with the other accused for the purpose of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">\f                                                              39</span>\n\n\ncheating. Be it noted that the High Court confirmed the\n\nacquittal of A-7 of the charge under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 120B</a> IPC. The\n\nHigh Court, accordingly, found that the proper offence made\n\nagainst him would be one for making forged document\n\nsimplicitor punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1317063/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 465</a> IPC.           In our\n\nconsidered opinion, the High Court was not justified in\n\nconvicting Mohd. Yunis (A-7) at all for it had found no case\n\nagainst the appellant made out under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 120B</a> IPC and\n\nfurther found that there is no evidence to assume that he\n\nwas hand in glove with the other accused for the purpose of\n\ncheating. That there is no evidence that A-7 prepared false\n\ndocument with intent to cause damage or injury, to the\n\npublic or to any person, or to support any claim or title, or to\n\ncause any person to part with property, or to enter into any\n\nexpress or implied contract, or with intent to commit fraud.\n\nThe ingredients of Section 463 are not satisfied. In such an\n\nevent the conviction of the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1317063/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 465</a> IPC\n\nis unsustainable.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">\f                                                                      40</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">31. That so far as D.

The courts\n\nbelow found that D. Gokari Saheb (A-8) was aware of the\n\ncontents of the article. It is under those circumstances the\n\ncourts below came to the right conclusion that evidence\n\navailable on record clearly establish that he participated in\n\nthe conspiracy in securing the passport for Monica Bedi in\n\nthe assumed name of Sana Malik Kamal.                          Thus the\n\nconviction of D. Gokari Saheb (A-8)                   for the charged\n\noffences is accordingly upheld.

Shaik Abdul Sattar (A-5) is the Head Constable who\n\nsubmitted exhibit P15 report. PW-7, PW-8 and PW-14 are\n\nthe material witnesses examined by the prosecution to\n\nprove the   accusations leveled against   A-5.   PW-7 at the\n\nrelevant time was Junior Assistant in the District Police\n\nOffice, Kurnool who speaks about entrustment of the\n\nverification of the passport application in respect of Sana\n\nMalik Kamal to A-5. He also speaks about A-5 submitting\n\nExhibit P15 inquiry report together with statements of\n\npersons purported to have been recorded by him in exhibit\n\nP16 and P17.     There is absolutely nothing on record to\n\ndisbelieve the evidence of PW-7 who stated in his evidence\n\nthat A-5 submitted exhibit P15 report knowing it to be a\n\nfalse one apart from certifying that Sana Malik Kamal was\n\nresiding at that particular house in Kurnool and was not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">\f                                                           42</span>\n\n\ninvolved in any civil and criminal cases and there was\n\nnothing adverse against her. PW-8 was working as Inspector\n\nof Police, District Special Branch, Kurnool who prepared\n\nexhibit P18 letter on the basis of exhibit P15 inquiry report\n\nsubmitted by A-5.     PW-14 is the Sub-Inspector, District\n\nSpecial Branch, Kurnool who testified that A-5 submitted\n\nexhibit P15 report and it bears signature of A-5. The courts\n\nbelow held that the evidence of PW-7, PW-8 and PW-14 is\n\ncogent and consistent which in clear and categorical terms\n\nprove the fact that A-5 is the person who verified the\n\npassport application particulars of Sana Malik Kamal and\n\nsubmitted exhibit P15 inquiry report along with exhibit P16\n\nand exhibit P17 enclosures.    There cannot be any doubt\n\nwhatsoever that A-5 submitted a false report in order to\n\nenable Monica Bedi to secure a passport for herself in the\n\nassumed name of Sana Malik Kamal. His conviction for the\n\ncharged offences is accordingly upheld.     The High Court\n\nhowever, reduced the sentence awarded by the trial court to\n\none year rigorous imprisonment under each count while\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">\f                                                            43</span>\n\n\nmaintaining the fine imposed by the trial court.

Having\n\nregard to the facts and circumstances of the present case,\n\nwe however, reduce the sentence to that of six months\n\nrigorous imprisonment under each count while maintaining\n\nthe fine imposed by the trial court and the sentence to suffer\n\nimprisonment, in default, of payment of fine. Sentences are\n\ndirected to run concurrently.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">\nCase of Monica Bedi - Appellant in Criminal Appeal No.\n\n782/2007:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">33. So far as the appellant - Monica Bedi is concerned she\n\nis involved in the conspiracy as proved at both stages i.e.\n\npre-passport application stage and post-passport application\n\nstage.   The conspiracy itself has been hatched only with a\n\nview to secure a passport for Monica Bedi in the assumed\n\nname of Sana Malik Kamal. We do not find any merit in the\n\nsubmission of Shri Tulsi, learned senior counsel that there is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">\f                                                           44</span>\n\n\nno evidence whatsoever against Monica Bedi to prove her\n\ninvolvement for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_113\">Sections 120B</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1667388/\" id=\"a_114\">419</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_115\">420</a> IPC.    The sequence of events as unfolded by\n\nthe evidence, which we do not want to recapitulate once\n\nagain as we have noticed the same in detail in the preceding\n\nparagraphs, clearly prove the charges levelled against\n\nMonica Bedi. It is for her benefit that the entire conspiracy\n\nhas been hatched involving more than one individual in\n\norder to secure a passport for her benefit enabling her to\n\ntravel abroad in the assumed name of Sana Malik Kamal.\n\nThere is no material based on which this Court is to differ\n\nwith the findings and conclusions concurrently arrived at by\n\nthe courts below.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">     Shri Tulsi, however, reiterated the submission which he\n\nmade before the High Court that exhibit P50 is a Photostat\n\ncopy of the passport in the name of Sana Malik Kamal and\n\nthe same is inadmissible document as it is not authenticated\n\nby legal keeper as provided under <a href=\"/doc/483657/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 78 (6)</a> of the\n\nIndian Evidence Act.   The submission was that based on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">\f                                                             45</span>\n\n\nsuch   inadmissible   document    no   prosecution   could   be\n\nlaunched and once it is to be held that the said document is\n\nnot admissible the whole case of the prosecution collapses\n\nlike a pack of cards. The High Court after elaborate\n\nconsideration of the matter came to the right conclusion that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/483657/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 78 (6)</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 deals with public\n\ndocument of any other class in a foreign country.       In the\n\npresent case, the original of exhibit P50 is the passport\n\nissued by the competent authorities in this country and,\n\ntherefore, Section 78 (6) has no application whatsoever to\n\nthe facts of this case. The issuance of original of exhibit P50\n\npassport is clearly proved.    It is based on that passport\n\nMonica Bedi travelled abroad and entered Portugal for which\n\nshe has to face a prosecution and suffer conviction and\n\nsentence.   The prosecution cannot be held to be vitiated.\n\nWe accordingly reject the contention and uphold the\n\nconviction of the appellant for the offence punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_118\">Sections 120B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1667388/\" id=\"a_119\">419</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_120\">420</a> IPC. The High Court, however,\n\nreduced the sentence of imprisonment imposed on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">\f                                                            46</span>\n\n\nappellant - Monica Bedi (A-3) as noticed in the preceding\n\nparagraphs. The High Court also held that she is entitled for\n\nset off of the periods of detention suffered by her in Lisbon\n\ni.e.   from   18.9.2004   to   4.6.2005   and   3.11.2005   to\n\n10.11.2005.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">       However, having regard to the facts and circumstances\n\nof the case and the fact that she had undergone more than\n\n2 = years of sentence, we consider it appropriate to reduce\n\nthe sentence to that of already undergone by her while\n\nmaintaining fine amount imposed by the courts below.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">34.
