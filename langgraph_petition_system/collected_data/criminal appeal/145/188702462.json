Learned    Senior       counsel     appearing     for\n\nappellant - Naresh Kumar Doshi, has submitted that\n\nthe case of the prosecution had been inherently,\n\nimprobable and there has been material contradictions\n\nin the statements of the prosecution witnesses in\n\nrespect of the involvement of appellant - Naresh\n\nKumar Doshi. There is no evidence that appellant -\n\nNaresh    Kumar      Doshi,    entered       into   a   criminal\n\nconspiracy with accused appellants - Rajkumar\n\nKushwaha, Dilip Sharma and Tarun Soni of causing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                           60</span>\n\ndamages to Sai Kripa Travels bus bearing registration\n\nNo. M.P.09-FA-2717, causing murder of its conductor -\n\nPankaj Panchal and passenger and abetted accused -\n\nRajkumar, Dilip and Tarun to cause the incident. To\n\nsupport the aforesaid, he has drawn our attention to\n\nthe statement of PW57 Dinesh Singh Chouhan and\n\nsubmits that bus in question is registered in the name\n\nof appellant - Naresh Kumar Doshi, National Permit\n\nNo.210 was issued on 12.10.2009 and on the basis of\n\nthe aforesaid National Permit, he had been operating\n\nthe bus between Nashik and Sikar. The finding of the\n\ntrial Court that for transportation of passengers no\n\npermit in M.P. is taken and conduction in M.P. was\n\ndone without permit and this fact is with the knowledge\n\nof the appellant, but he ought to have clear the\n\nsituation and had there been a permit, he would have\n\nproduced it. He submitted that no case for an offence\n\nunder any of the provision of the <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_20\">Motor Vehicles Act,\n\n1988</a> was registered against appellant - Naresh\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                           60</span>\n\nKumar Doshi.

He has drawn our\n\nattention to Exhibits P/123, P/124 and Exhibit P/125/1,\n\n2, 3 and 4 and submits that the learned trial Court\n\nwrongly gave a finding that permit was not produced\n\nby the owner to ply the bus whereas permit is part of\n\nthe charge-sheet (Exhibit P/155). It is also submitted\n\nthat there is no evidence of pre-planning. The dispute\n\nwas originally between accused - appellant No.1 -\n\nRajkumar Kushwaha and Pankaj Panchal conductor of\n\nSai Kripa Travels as is evident from paragraphs 14 and\n\n17 of the statement of (PW3) Praveen Jaiswal. Pankaj\n\nPanchal and Kali Bai in their dying declarations have\n\nnot made any allegations and later on (PW16) Anita\n\nwife of Pankaj Panchal, for the first time in her court\n\nstatement made allegations against appellant -\n\nNaresh Kumar Doshi. There is an omission in her 161\n\nstatement (Exhibit D/16).

State of Assam\n\nreported as AIR SC 2010 Pg. No.3813. In respect of\n\nconspiracy, he has drawn our attention to para 16 of\n\nthe decision of the Apex Court in the case of Param\n\nHansh v/s. State of Bihar, reported as AIR 1987 SC\n\n955, paragraphs 66 and 257 of the decision of the\n\nApex Court in the case of Kehar Singh v/s.

The statements made by\n\nthe key witnesses were full of contradictions and could\n\nnot be relied upon.

He submits that court\n\nhas to examine the facts of the case in proper\n\nperspective where the said ghastly crime had been\n\ncommitted where 14 passengers stood roasted and 19\n\npassengers have suffered burn injuries. He also drawn\n\nour attention to the decisions of the Apex Court in the\n\ncase of C. Muniappan &amp; Ors. V/s. State of Tamil\n\nNadu, reported as 2010 (9) SCC 567, Sunder Singh\n\nv/s.

State\n\nof Bengal, reported as 2012 (12) JT 490 (SC) and\n\nsubmitted that the Court has to consider the mitigating\n\nand aggravating circumstances in each case, ie., the\n\ndegree of brutality, depravity and diabolic nature of\n\noffence. In such matters, it is not only a nature of\n\ncrime, but the background of criminal, his psychology,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                            60</span>\n\nhis social condition, his mindset for committing offence\n\nand effect of imposing alternative punishment on the\n\nsociety are also relevant factors. He submits that\n\nmurder of large number of persons has been\n\ncommitted. There is no cogent reason to interfere with\n\nthe punishment of death sentence awarded to accused\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">- appellant - Rajkumar Kushwaha, Dilip Sharma and\n\nTarun Soni. It is also submitted that there is no rule of\n\nlaw that deposition of a hostile witness is to be\n\ndiscarded in toto. He lastly submits that no mitigating\n\ncircumstances could be pointed out for a lesser\n\nsentence. Both the appeals lack merit and are liable to\n\nbe dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">31.       We have considered the rival submissions\n\nmade by the learned counsel for the parties and\n\nperused the records.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">32.       The evidence of the prosecution on the point\n\nof first dispute at Sendhwa barrier is deposed by PW1\n\nSantosh, but he has omitted some details. PW3\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                             60</span>\n\nPraveen had vide paragraph 4 of his testimony had\n\nconfirmed it. PW4 Tarabai in paragraph 2 of her\n\ntestimony also confirmed this dispute. So also PW5\n\nLakhan      vide    paragraph    2,   PW6   Kishore   vide\n\nparagraph 2, PW10 Bhimsingh vide paragraph 2,\n\nPW11 Jyoti vide paragraph 5, PW12 Pushpabai vide\n\nparagraph 2, PW15 Chathiya vide paragraph 6, PW19\n\nChokharam vide paragraph 4, PW25 Sanjana vide\n\nparagraph      2,    PW29       Umesh   Fullpagare    vide\n\nparagraphs 2 and 10. PW41 Rajendra Khori vide\n\nparagraph 3, PW51 Naseeb Ali vide paragraph 3 have\n\nalso confirmed the dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">33.         Thus, it is clearly established that Pankaj\n\nPanchal had beaten appellant No.1 - Rajkumar\n\nKushwaha (cleaner of Ashok Travels) and had\n\nhumiliated him in public view. This act resulted in\n\nsudden and grave provocation to Rajkumar and before\n\nhe could act Sai Kripa bus people speeded away from\n\nthe spot.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                           60</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_39\">34.       Sai Kripa bus people as they were speeding\n\naway would have escaped very easily but due to\n\naccidental Jam (Road Block), which was at the\n\nBalsamud Toll barrier, they were compelled to halt at\n\nthat place. There was no time gap in which the anger\n\ncaused by humiliation of accused appellant No.1 -\n\nRajkumar Kushwaha, could have cooled down and\n\naccidental Jam (Road Block) at Toll barrier gave an\n\nopportunity to the Ashok Travels&#x27; employees to avenge\n\nthe humiliation caused to them by Pankaj Panchal.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_40\">35.       The second stage was the barrier at\n\nBalsamud where, the whole incident had taken place.\n\nIn this matter, if we look into the FIR (Exhibit P/1)\n\nlodged by PW1 which mentions that the petrol was\n\npoured aiming at the conductor. The first information\n\nreport Exhibit P/1 lodged by PW1, as is revealed in the\n\ntestimony, PW2 (the father) that both of them were\n\nsitting at the rear end of the seat (as per paragraph 4\n\nof his deposition).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                            60</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">36.       Other    persons      except   PW3     (whose\n\nstatement is being examined little later) saw throwing\n\nof petrol, which is also deposed by PW4 vide\n\nparagraph 3, PW5 Lakhan vide paragraphs 3, 4 and 6,\n\nPW6 Kishore vide paragraphs 3 and 4, PW9\n\nNoorjahan Beg vide paragraph 4.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">37.       This witness PW9 of course vide paragraph\n\n5 had given a story in the Court that the door of the\n\nbus was closed, but had not stated the same in her\n\ncase diary statement (Exhibit D/2).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">38.       Similarly, PW10 Bhimsingh supported the\n\nversion of setting fire to the person at the gate, but\n\nimproved the version from his case diary statement\n\n(Exhibit D/3) that the gate of Sai Kripa bus was also\n\nclosed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">39.       PW51 Naseeb Ali, in paragraph 4 stated the\n\nversion of driver inquiring about &#x27;Dada&#x27; Sai Kripa bus\n\nand then, throwing of petrol on the bus and setting it to\n\nfire. He omitted the version that petrol was thrown at\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                             60</span>\n\nthe conductor and he was set to fire. This man has\n\ntried to depose that the petrol was thrown at the bus to\n\nset it to fire and not on the conductor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">40.       PW1 Santosh Prajapati, complainant - eye-\n\nwitness - Passenger of Sai Kripa Bus in his statement\n\nhas deposed that the staff of buses of Ashok Travels\n\nand Sai Kripa Travels had a quarrel at Sendhwa\n\nbarrier. Pankaj Panchal (conductor of Sai Kripa Bus)\n\nhit/beat the appellant No.1 - Rajkumar Kushwaha and\n\nthen, sped away in his bus. The bus held up in Jam\n\n(Road Block) at Balasumund Toll barrier. Ashok Travels\n\nbus overtook. Three accused persons came down\n\nthen, appellant No.3 - Tarun Soni, driver of the bus\n\nasked appellant No.1 - Rajkumar Kushwaha, cleaner\n\nof the bus asked appellant No.2 - Dilip Sharma,\n\nconductor of the bus to break the legs of the conductor\n\nof Sai Kripa bus Pankaj Panchal. A/1 poured the petrol\n\non (the deceased) conductor - Pankaj Panchal, the\n\nbus caught fire.

Jyoti (PW11) - passenger eye-\n\nwitness. Their statements are similar to       PW1 -\n\nSantosh Prajapati. Jyoti (PW11) in para 7 of her\n\nstatement has deposed that deceased Pankaj Panchal\n\nran inside the bus. Smt. Pushpa Bai (PW12), Smt.\n\nSanjana      (PW25),   Umesh    Fullpagare    (PW29),\n\nMohammed Nayeem (PW41), Rajendra Kohri (PW48)\n\nand Nasib Ali (PW51), their statements are also similar\n\nto the statement of Santosh Prajapati (PW1). Except\n\nthat Sanjana (PW25) in her statement has deposed\n\nthat petrol was thrown on conductor - Pankaj Panchal.\n\nUmesh Fullpagare (PW29) in his statement has\n\ndeposed that petrol was thrown on bus and not on the\n\nconductor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">41.       The initial version, which was deposed by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                            60</span>\n\nPW1 to PW8 was tried to modified by the prosecution\n\nby introducing the version of closing the gate of the\n\nbus. This was done with the intention to suggest\n\nthat the dispute was not with the conductor Pankaj\n\nPanchal, but was against the entire bus and,\n\ntherefore, the version of setting of the bus to fire was\n\ndesigned by all the accused persons present at the\n\nspot. Therefore, it is an intentional case of causing\n\ndeath of the passengers of the bus and also the other\n\ninjured persons who managed to escape by breaking\n\nthe windows of the bus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">42.       This second version of setting fire to bus\n\nitself by throwing petrol is totally contrary to the FIR\n\nand the main witness (PW3) Praveen, the cleaner of\n\nthe Sai Kripa bus, who has faithfully deposed the\n\nincident without mixing anything.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">43.       (PW3) Praveen in paragraph 4 of his\n\ndeposition has stated that he had asked the Ashok\n\nTravels bus people to set a time table for the buses.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                            60</span>\n\nWhen this was refused Pankaj Panchal, the conductor\n\nstarted beating to Rajkumar. In respect of mar-peet of\n\nRajkumar as per paragraph 39 of his statement, he\n\nadmitted that he also participated in it. This witness in\n\npara 5 has stated that after separating the bus\n\nconductor and Rajkumar, he asked his bus conductor\n\nthat we should go ahead of the bus of the accused\n\npersons and lift the passengers. In paragraph 6, this\n\nwitness has stated that at the RTO barrier, he had\n\ncome out of the bus. At that very point of time Tarun,\n\nDilip and Rajkumar of Ashok Travels alighted from the\n\nbus.

In paragraph 11 he refused to\n\nsupport the version of any bravado of the accused\n\npersons and on that issue he was declared hostile vide\n\nparagraph 13 and he disowned the version (Exhibit\n\nP/8) that accused Tarun had shouted that he had a talk\n\nwith Naresh Seth. It is a dispute occurring every day,\n\nthey every day pick up the passengers; Naresh Seth\n\nhas said - ^fuiVk nks lkyksa dks] esS lc ns[k yawxk^ this was not\n\nstated. In paragraph 15 this witness stated that he was\n\nworking on the Sai Kripa bus from 7 months prior to\n\nthe date of incident. In paragraph 17, he categorically\n\nstates that before the date of incident there was never\n\nany quarrel with the staff of Ashok Travels bus. There\n\nwas never any dispute about picking up of the\n\npassengers before this date. He had observed Ashok\n\nTravels bus for last three months, which was not\n\nreaching on time. In paragraph 18 he candidly\n\nadmitted that the Sai Kripa bus also had no permit to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                           60</span>\n\npick up passengers from Sendhwa. The permit was in\n\nparts while travelling from Dhamnod to Indore and\n\nfrom Dhamnod to Sendhwa. In paragraph 19, he\n\nadmits that the bus had to stop at the Toll tax barrier\n\nbecause there was a Jam and if there was no Jam\n\nthey would have gone ahead. After they halted on the\n\nbarrier within 2-3 minutes Ashok Travels bus also\n\narrived. In paragraph 22, he stayed at the scene only\n\nfor 5 minutes and then escaped. He had denied the\n\nsuggestion that he escaped because he had himself\n\nset to fire the bus of Ashok Travels. In paragraph 28,\n\nhe accepts that Dilip had hit Pankaj with Tommy on the\n\nright leg and he had fallen down. He was confronted\n\nwith his case diary statement (Exhibit P/8) about\n\nsetting fire to the bus by petrol, which was not stated\n\nearlier.

The whole\n\nepisode occurred because by accident the Sai Kripa\n\nbus could go ahead and was forcibly required to halt at\n\nBalsamud Toll barrier which had occasioned due to the\n\nJam at that place. Had the jam not been there on that\n\nday the episode would not have taken place at all and\n\nSai Kripa bus would have gone and after a little\n\npassage of time, the tempers might have cooled.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">55.

Before loading the motor-cycle in the bus\n\nas a preventive measure from setting fire to bus by\n\nleakage of petrol, the petrol was taken out of the petrol\n\ntank of the motor-cycle in the plastic Can. This petrol\n\nwould have been put back in the motor-cycle on the\n\narrival at Sikar if the travel would have continued.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">56.       The story of subsequent witnesses that the\n\npetrol was thrown at the bus and not at the conductor\n\nis totally falsified because the actual scene was\n\nwitnessed by PW3 alone and the other witnesses who\n\nwere the passengers were sitting inside the bus could\n\nnot have observed the entire incident some of them\n\nwho had received compensation from the State\n\nGovernment agreed to give the version that it was the\n\nbus, which was set to fire and not the conductor. It can\n\nbe presumed that these witnesses who were given\n\ncompensation     by   the   State    Government        were\n\npersuaded by the prosecution to state that the accused\n\npersons had deliberately thrown petrol on the bus and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                            60</span>\n\nset the bus to fire and not the conductor.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">57.

The contention of Ms. Rekha Shrivastava,\n\nlearned counsel for the appellants that the incident is\n\nthe outcome of the sudden and grave porvocation\n\nagainst Pankaj Panchal. Though he had died in the\n\nincident, but it is clear from the fact that there was no\n\nintention to kill him, but only to teach him a lesson,\n\nbecause by Tommy he was not hit on the head, but on\n\nthe leg. Neither he was prevented from escaping nor\n\nhe was grievously injured in the incident. He did not\n\ndie instantly, he was taken to M.Y. Hospital, Indore and\n\nthere he succumbed to injuries. His dying declaration\n\nwas recorded. Thus, it is clear that the offence against\n\nhim was a product of sudden and grave provocation,\n\nwhich was caused by him by hitting Rajkumar in public\n\nview and, therefore, the entire action would attract\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                            60</span>\n\nSection 304 (Part-I or Part-II) of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_24\">IPC</a> and not <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_25\">Section\n\n302</a> of IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_65\">59.       Learned Senior counsel would contend that\n\nthe story of conspiracy is introduced merely to rope\n\nappellant - (accused No.4) - Naresh Kumar Doshi,\n\nowner of the bus of Ashok Travels. None of the\n\nprosecution witnesses have stated that there was any\n\nbravado uttered by Tarun. The hatching of the\n\nconspiracy of setting a fire to the bus and causing\n\ndeath of passengers was not all in existence. It could\n\nnot be in comprehension of anyone that on the fateful\n\nday there would be a quarrel at Sendhwa and it would\n\nbe followed by the incident at Balsamud barrier. In fact\n\nPraveen (PW3) admits that the quarrel took place for\n\nthe first time. The version put that Naresh Kumar Doshi\n\nhad directed to do it, is totally destroyed by the\n\ntestimony of these witnesses and also by the\n\ntestimony of the Investigating Officer who had candidly\n\nadmitted that after having got the record of telephonic\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                             60</span>\n\ntalks of Naresh Kumar Doshi, for 30 days before the\n\ndate of incident, he could find no version by which it\n\ncould be proved that Naresh Kumar Doshi accused\n\nNo.4 had talked with the three employees namely;\n\nTarun, Rajkumar and Dilip before the incident.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">60.       It is clear from the prosecution version of\n\n(PW18) Dilip son of Radheyshyam Karbra that Naresh\n\nKumar Doshi - (accused No.4) had a business of\n\ntransport and, therefore, he had employed PW18 as\n\nManager to look after the buses. It was PW18, the\n\nManager who was managing the affairs of this bus and\n\nit was he who was dealing in the entire business,\n\ntherefore, the version that Naresh Seth (accused No.4)\n\nis directly involved and he had himself asked such kind\n\nof criminal activity, is absolutely unbelievable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">61.       It is quite true that evidence of conspiracy is\n\nnot easily available, because it is hatched in secrecy,\n\nbut it is settled law as laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex\n\nCourt that a meeting of mind has got to be established\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                              60</span>\n\nfor the purpose of conspiracy and it is also to be\n\nproved by the prosecution that what was the object of\n\nconspiracy. It is also settled law that if the person is not\n\nat the spot of the crime and is trying to be roped in by\n\nvirtue of his being owner/co-conspirator in committing\n\nthe incident, very strong proof is required to be\n\nadduced by the prosecution. This being totally absent\n\nin this case, appellant - Naresh Kumar Doshi is\n\nentitled to acquittal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">62.        The Apex Court in the case of R. Shaji v/s.\n\nState of Kerala, reported as AIR 2013 SC 651,\n\nwherein it has been pointed out about the conspiracy.\n\nIn para 31 the Apex Court observed that all the stages\n\nof offence need not be known to every person, but the\n\nknowledge     of   the   main     object/purpose   of   the\n\nconspiracy would warrant the attraction of relevant\n\npenal provision. Thus, an agreement between two\n\npersons to do or to cause an illegal act is the basic\n\nrequirement of the offence of conspiracy. Thus, as per\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                            60</span>\n\nthe decision of the Apex Court in the case of R. Shaji\n\nv/s. State of Kerala (supra), the agreement between\n\nthe accused persons to do the main object of the crime\n\nis to be proved. It is needless to mention that in this\n\ncase such evidence is absolutely absent and,\n\ntherefore, appellant - Naresh Kumar Doshi, cannot be\n\ndragged in, in the alleged offence by making him a co-\n\nconspirator of the actual crime committed. Thus, the\n\ntrial Court has condemned appellant - Naresh Kumar\n\nDoshi, for not filing the documents pertaining to plying\n\nof the bus under the <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_26\">Motor Vehicles Act</a>, because it is\n\nobserved that by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 106</a> of the Evidence\n\nAct, he can draw adverse inference against (accused\n\nNo.4) - Naresh Kumar Doshi, because according to\n\nthe trial court, these facts were specially within the\n\nknowledge of Naresh Kumar Doshi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">63.       In the present case, when the prosecution\n\nitself came out with the case that there is a national\n\npermit for the bus of Naresh Kumar Doshi / Ashok\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                             60</span>\n\nTravels and all fitness certificates obtained from the\n\nRTO Chittorgarh were attached with the Challan. The\n\nlearned trial Judge has absolutely misdirected itself on\n\nthis count.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">64.       The learned Court below has totally ignored\n\nthat when PW3 himself admits that the dispute about\n\npicking up of the passengers had taken place for the\n\nfirst time on that day. PW3 further admits that it is they\n\nwho were not entitled to pick up the passengers at\n\nSendhwa because they had no direct permit from\n\nSendhwa to Indore. It was of different stages.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">65.       The learned court below absolutely ignored\n\nthat plying of bus without permit is an offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 192</a> of the Motor Vehicles\n\nAct and the absence of any prosecution that the bus\n\nwas being plied without permit did not prove that they\n\nwere committing an illegal act from which a conspiracy\n\ncan be inferred. The learned trial Judge has too much\n\nassumed that the bus was plying without permit and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                            60</span>\n\nthat was the illegal act, which constituted the basis of\n\nthe charges of conspiracy under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 120-B</a> of IPC.\n\nThe learned trial Judge seems to be over whelmed by\n\nthe number of deaths, which occurred in the case and\n\non moral conviction has recorded a conviction against\n\nappellant - Naresh Kumar Doshi and have convicted\n\nother accused persons under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 302</a> of IPC and\n\nsentenced them to death.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">66.       Of course, Hon&#x27;ble the Supreme Court has\n\nrefused to acquit the accused persons rightly when\n\ninvestigating authorities did not perform their duties\n\nproperly, vide judgment reported in the case reported\n\nin AIR 2004 SC 1920, D. Singh v/s. State of Punjab\n\nin paragraphs 5 and 6. The same was the view in the\n\ncase of Babu v/s. State, reported in AIR 2013 SC\n\n1769.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">67.       In the present case, the criticism of the\n\nlearned Court below that the police did not produce the\n\npermits under the <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_31\">Motor Vehicles Act</a> and the accused\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                            60</span>\n\nwas also under a duty to establish by producing permit\n\n/ documents in his favour and, therefore, by drawing\n\nan adverse inference the court concluded that there\n\nwas a conspiracy of violating the <a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_32\">Motor Vehicles Act</a>,\n\npermitting and lifting the passengers without any\n\nauthority of law. The learned Court below has\n\nabsolutely overlooked that the prosecution itself has\n\nproduced the valid permits of the Ashok Travels bus\n\nalong with the challan and did not file any case under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/785258/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 192</a> of the Motor Vehicles Act for using the\n\nMotor bus for carrying passengers without permit.\n\nTherefore, the view of the learned court below about\n\nthe failure of the appellant to produce permits vitiates\n\nits entire consideration of the matter against accused\n\nappellant No.4 - Naresh Kumar Doshi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">68.       In the present case, besides appellant -\n\nNaresh Kumar Doshi, being only the Proprietor of the\n\nbus and the permit holder there is absolutely, no\n\nevidence of meeting of minds of accused appellant -\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                            60</span>\n\nNaresh Kumar Doshi, with others at the scene of the\n\ncrime. Admittedly,he was not at the spot and the\n\nevidence of alleged talks is negatived by the telephone\n\nrecord collected by the Investigating Officer showing\n\nthe absence of any communication between appellant\n\nNo.4 - Naresh Kumar Doshi and other employees.\n\nThus, on the analogy of this case, a conclusion of\n\nconspiracy can be arrived at against appellant -\n\nNaresh Kumar Doshi, is unsustainable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">69.       In the present case beyond that Naresh\n\nKumar Doshi, being the bus owner, there is absolutely,\n\nno evidence of any meetings of mind of Naresh Kumar\n\nDoshi, who was 300 Kms. away from the spot, of\n\nentering into a conspiracy and asking the condemned\n\naccused persons to set fire the conductor and set\n\nablaze the bus does not arise. As held by the Supreme\n\nCourt that relationship alone was not a proof of\n\nentering into conspiracy as stated by the prosecution.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">70.       Decision of Chandran @ Manichan @\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                            60</span>\n\nManiyan v/s. State of Kerala reported as AIR 2011\n\nSC 1594 was heavily relied on by the learned trial\n\nCourt to say that Master ie., Naresh Kumar Doshi, had\n\npermitted the employees to illegally ply the bus without\n\npermit and, therefore, the incident which have arisen\n\nwas due to illegal plying of the bus can be fastened on\n\nthe accused in the present case because the Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of Chadran (Supra) has held that\n\ndoing of illegal mixing of poisonous is not required to\n\nbe manually done by the Proprietor of the business\n\nand, therefore, the lower Court drawing an analogy\n\nfrom the principle to hold guilty appellant No.4 -\n\nNaresh Kumar Doshi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">71.       Reliance of the trial Court in the case of R.\n\nShaji (Supra) is far-fetched as already has been found\n\nout from the judgment of Kehar Singh (Supra) and\n\nthe judgment of the Supreme Court reported in Baliya\n\n@ Balkishan v/s. State of M.P. reported as J.T. 2012\n\n(10) SC 145. It is very clear that, there is necessity to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                           60</span>\n\nprove of meetings of mind by appellant - Naresh\n\nKumar Doshi with what has happened on the fateful\n\nday. The whole case was a result of beating given to\n\nappellant No.1 - Rajkumar Kushwaha by Pankaj\n\nPanchal, the conductor of Sai Kripa Bus. Accidentally,\n\nthere was petrol on that day in the vehicle. There is\n\npositive admission of PW3 that before this no other\n\ndispute took place up to this date. The theory of any\n\nconspiracy to do the killing of 14 by burning the bus\n\nwith petrol is based on mere moral conviction of the\n\nlearned trial Court that appellant - Naresh Kumar\n\nDoshi being the owner of the bus plying his bus\n\nwithout permit so he should be held guilty of the acts\n\ndone by the three condemned persons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">72.      The finding of the trial Court that the bus was\n\nplying contrary to <a href=\"/doc/73096737/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 192-A</a> of the M.V. Act is\n\ntotally based on conjectures and not on evidence and\n\non this finding holding appellant - Naresh Kumar\n\nDoshi, guilty of <a href=\"/doc/73096737/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 192-A</a> of M.V. Act, when such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                               60</span>\n\ncase have not been put up by the prosecution at any\n\nstage because Exhibit P/125 destroys the assessment\n\nof the learned trial Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">73.        In AIR 2011 SC 760 (Kalyan Kumar v/s.\n\nAshutosh)      the   Hon&#x27;ble       Apex   Court    has   vide\n\nparagraphs 21 and 22 analyzed the underlying\n\nprinciple of excluding hear-say evidence. The Court\n\nhas culled out the principle that hear-say is excluded\n\nfrom evidence, because maker of the evidence does\n\nnot take responsibility for his statement, but throws it\n\non someone else. If such evidence were to be\n\npermitted then, it will destroy the reliability.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_80\">74.        Therefore, in the present case, when there is\n\nabsolutely, no charge under <a href=\"/doc/73096737/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 192-A</a> of the Motor\n\nVehicles Act of plying the bus without any permit, the\n\nlearned trial Court has totally acted on its whims and\n\nthus acted against the settled principle of law by\n\ninvoking <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 106</a> of the Evidence Act and arrived\n\nat a perverse conclusion that the accused was plying\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                             60</span>\n\nthe bus without permit and so this conspiracy would\n\nextend to setting fire to conductor, passengers and the\n\nbus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">75.       In the case of Paramjeet Singh v/s. State\n\nof Uttarakhand) reported as AIR 2011 SC 200,\n\nHon&#x27;ble the Supreme Court, vide per paragraph 13 has\n\nheld that burden of proving an offence is always on the\n\nprosecution and stricter proof is required, when the\n\noffence is more serious. The present case is also a\n\nvery serious matter and very strict proof alone would\n\nbe sufficient to warrant a conclusion of guilt.\n\nFortunately, for appellant - Naresh Kumar Doshi, there\n\nis absolutely, no evidence in this regard.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">76.       Dinesh Singh Chouhan (PW57), would take\n\nover investigation on 23.8.2011 produced permits of\n\nAshok Travels bus vide Exhibit P/125 and admitted in\n\npara 36 that he collected CDRs of accused appellant\n\nNo.4 - Naresh Kumar Doshi for one month prior, but\n\nno record of appellant No.4 talking to appellants No.1,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                           60</span>\n\n2 and 3. In para 38, he has deposed that he registered\n\na counter case as Ashok Travels bus was burnt too.\n\nAdmittedly, at the time of occurrence, accused\n\nappellant No.4 - Naresh Kumar Doshi, 300 Kms. away\n\nfrom the place of accident. No named FIR has been\n\nlodged against him. PW16 Anita only named him.\n\nInvestigating Officer - Dinesh Singh Chouhan (PW57)\n\nin his statement very categorically admitted that there\n\nis no evidence of conversation between accused No.4\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">- Naresh Kumar Doshi and other appellants. The\n\nlearned trial Court gave a wrong finding that no permit\n\nwas produced by the bus owner. As per statement of\n\n(PW3) Praveen, the issue arose between accused\n\nappellant No.1 - Rajkumar Kushwaha and deceased\n\nPankaj Panchal. In the dying declaration Exhibit P/100\n\nalso there is no reference of telephonic conversation.\n\nFirst time the story was built up by (PW16) Anita, wife\n\nof deceased - Pankaj Panchal, who was not present at\n\nthe time of occurrence. In her 161 statement (Exhibit\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                           60</span>\n\nD/6), nothing has been stated about the telephonic\n\nconversation. As per Exhibit P/125, accused No.4 -\n\nNaresh Kumar Doshi, was having National Permit,\n\nwhich was valid up to 11.10.2011.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\">77.       Thus,   considering   the   totality   of   the\n\nevidence, there is nothing on record to prove the case\n\nagainst appellant - Naresh Kumar Doshi. Thus, we\n\nallow Criminal Appeal No.1420/2013, so far as relates\n\nto appellant - Naresh Kumar Doshi and set aside the\n\nimpugned judgment of conviction and sentence\n\nawarded to appellant - Naresh Kumar Doshi and he is\n\naccordingly, acquitted from the charges under Sections\n\n435 read with Section 120-B, 302 read with Section\n\n120-B and 307 read with <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 120-B</a> of IPC.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">78.       In respect of Criminal Appeal No.1323/2013\n\nof appellants - Rajkumar Kushwaha, Dilip Sharma and\n\nTarun Soni, we see no infirmity in the judgment under\n\nappeal. There is no merit in the submissions raised on\n\nbehalf of them.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                              60</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">79.        Criminal Appeal No.1323/2013, has no merit\n\nand is liable to be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">80.        Now, the question, the law which require\n\nconsideration whether the present case would fall\n\nunder &#x27;rarest of rare case&#x27;, so as to justify awarding of\n\ncapital    punishment   to    appellants   -   Rajkumar\n\nKushwaha, Dilip Sharma and Tarun Soni.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">81.        The Apex Court has consistently held that\n\nonly in those exceptional cases where the crime is so\n\nbrutally, diabolical and revolting so as to shock the\n\ncollective conscience of the community, would it be\n\nappropriate to award death sentence. Since such\n\ncircumstances cannot be laid down as a straight jacket\n\nformula but must be ascertained from case to case,\n\nthe legislature has left it open for the Courts to\n\nexamine the facts of the case and appropriately decide\n\nupon the sentence proportional to the gravity of the\n\noffence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">82.        Having noticed the decisions of the Apex\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                             60</span>\n\nCourt on the said aspect, we would revert to the\n\nfactual position of this case. Herein, time, place,\n\nmanner and the motive behind commission of crime\n\nspeak volumes of the callous nature of the offence. We\n\nare of the considered view that the instant case falls\n\ninto such category of rarest of the rare case where\n\nculpability has assumed the proportion of extreme\n\ndepravity and the appellants are perfect examples who\n\nslayed fourteen innocent lives. The entire incident\n\nshocks the collective conscience of the community.\n\nThe acts of murder committed by the appellants are so\n\ngruesome, merciless and brutal that the aggravating\n\ncircumstances      far     outweigh    the      mitigating\n\ncircumstances. Thus, we have no hesitation in holding\n\nthat this case falls in the categories of &#x27;rarest of rare\n\ncases&#x27; where the sentence for death of appellants has\n\nrightly been awarded by the trial Court and such\n\nsentence eminently was desirable, which in our\n\nconsidered   view,   not    only   deters    others   from\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                             60</span>\n\ncommitting such atrocious crime, but also manifest\n\nsociety&#x27;s abhorrence of such crime. This case not only\n\nshocks   the   judicial   conscience,   but   even   the\n\nconscience of the society and in our view, the nature of\n\ncrime and the situation demands award of death\n\nsentence to appellants - Rajkumar Kushwaha, Dilip\n\nSharma and Tarun Soni.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\">83.       In the result, Criminal Appeal No.1323/2013,\n\nfiled by the appellants - Rajkumar Kushwaha, Dilip\n\nSharma and Tarun Soni, is hereby dismissed, death\n\nsentence is hereby confirmed and Criminal Appeal\n\nNo.1420/2013, filed by appellant - Naresh Kumar\n\nDoshi, is allowed. He is on bail. His bail bond and\n\nsurety bond are hereby discharged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">   (P.K.
