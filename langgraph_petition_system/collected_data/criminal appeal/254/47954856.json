The learned counsel appearing for the appellant–State of\n       Uttar Pradesh has invited our attention to the definition of\n       ‘penetrative sexual assault’ under clause (a) of <a href=\"/doc/189755549/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 3</a> of\n       the POCSO Act.

He submitted that now the respondent is\n       completely reformed. He also stated that the respondent has\n       moved ahead in life and in fact, recently he got married.

However, the amended\n       provision will not apply to this case as the incident has taken\n       place prior to 16th August 2019.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">       11.      Surprisingly, the High Court has observed that <a href=\"/doc/153588598/\" id=\"a_26\">Section\n       5</a> was not applicable, and the offence committed by the\n       respondent falls under the category of a lesser offence of\n       penetrative sexual assault, which is punishable under <a href=\"/doc/26275631/\" id=\"a_27\">Section\n       4</a> of the POCSO Act.        Thus, the High Court committed an\n       obvious error by holding that the act committed by the\n       respondent was not an aggravated penetrative sexual assault.\n       In fact, the Special Court was right in punishing the\n       respondent under <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 6</a> and sentencing him to undergo\n       rigorous imprisonment for ten years with a fine of Rs.5,000/­.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">       12.     <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_29\">The POCSO Act</a> was enacted to provide more stringent\n       punishments for the offences of child abuse of various kinds\n       and that is why minimum punishments have been prescribed\n       in <a href=\"/doc/26275631/\" id=\"a_30\">Sections 4</a>, <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_31\">6</a>, <a href=\"/doc/188860642/\" id=\"a_32\">8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/174845796/\" id=\"a_33\">10</a> of the POCSO Act for various\n       categories of sexual assaults on children. Hence, <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 6</a>,\n       on its plain language, leaves no discretion to the Court and\n       there is no option but to impose the minimum sentence as\n       done by the Trial Court.     When a penal provision uses the\n       phraseology “shall not be less than….”, the Courts cannot do\n       offence to the Section and impose a lesser sentence.       The\n       Courts are powerless to do that unless there is a specific\n       statutory provision enabling the Court to impose a lesser\n\n\nCriminal Appeal No.1633 of 2023\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                         Page 7 of 9</span>\n\f       sentence. However, we find no such provision in the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_35\">POCSO\n       Act</a>. Therefore, notwithstanding the fact that the respondent\n       may have moved ahead in life after undergoing the sentence\n       as modified by the High Court, there is no question of\n       showing any leniency to him. Apart from the fact that the law\n       provides for a minimum sentence, the crime committed by the\n       respondent is very gruesome which calls for very stringent\n       punishment. The impact of the obnoxious act on the mind of\n       the victim­child will be life­long.             The impact is bound to\n       adversely affect the healthy growth of the victim. There is no\n       dispute that the age of the victim was less than twelve years\n       at the time of the incident. Therefore, we have no option but\n       to set aside the impugned judgment of the High Court and\n       restore the judgment of the Trial Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">       13.     Accordingly, the appeal is allowed.                The impugned\n       judgment and order dated 18th November 2021 passed by the\n       High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Criminal Appeal\n       No.5415 of 2018 is quashed and set aside and the judgment\n       and order dated 24th August 2018 passed by the learned 8 th\n       Additional Sessions Judge, Special Judge POCSO Act, Jhansi\n       in    Special     Session    Trial     No.134    of     2016   is    restored.\n       Accordingly, Criminal Appeal No.5415 of 2018 filed before the\n       High Court stands dismissed. The respondent shall undergo\n       rigorous      imprisonment       for    ten     years    for   the    offence\n       punishable under <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 6</a> of the POCSO Act and shall pay a\n       fine of Rs.5,000/­.
