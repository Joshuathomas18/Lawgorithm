We need not go into these questions as\n\n         the record clearly indicates that an objection was raised by the Advocate\n\n         appearing for the appellants right at the initial stage that the evidence was\n\n         being recorded without ensuring the presence of the appellants in Court.\n\n         There was neither any willingness on the part of the appellants nor any order\n\n         or direction by the trial Court that the evidence be recorded in the absence of\n\n         the appellants. The matter, therefore, would not come within the scope of\n\n         the latter part of <a href=\"/doc/1151812/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 273</a> and it cannot be said that there was any\n\n         dispensation as contemplated by the said Section.            We will, therefore,\n\n         proceed on the footing that there was no dispensation and yet the evidence\n\n         was recorded without ensuring the presence of the accused.

Chapter\n\n       XXXV of the Code deals with “Irregular Proceedings”, and <a href=\"/doc/1329851/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 461</a>\n\n       stipulates certain infringements or irregularities which vitiate proceedings.\n\n       Barring those stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/1329851/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 461</a>, the thrust of the Chapter is that any\n\n       infringement or irregularity would not vitiate the proceedings unless, as a\n\n       result of such infringement or irregularity, great prejudice had occasioned to\n\n       the accused.

The\n\n          evidence was thus led in the trial in Pune in his absence when he was not\n\n          sent up for trial, at the end of which all the accused were acquitted.\n\n          However, in an appeal arising therefrom, this Court convicted some of the\n\n          accused for offences with which they were tried. In the meantime, Jayendra\n\n          Vishnu Thakur was convicted by the Court in Delhi and was undergoing\n\n          sentence imposed upon him. Later, he was produced before the Court in\n\n          Pune with a supplementary charge-sheet and charges were framed against\n\n          him along with certain other accused. A request was made by the Public\n\n          Prosecutor that the evidence of some of the witnesses, which was led in the\n\n          earlier trial be read in evidence in the fresh trial against Jayendra Vishnu\n\n          Thakur as those witnesses were either dead or not available to be\n\n          examined23.

Thus, the prejudice was inherent. It is in this factual\n\n       context that the observations of this Court have to be considered. Same is\n\n       not the situation in the present matter. It is not the direction of the High\n\n       Court to read the entire evidence on the earlier occasion as evidence in the\n\n       de novo trial. The direction is to re-examine those witnesses who were not\n\n       examined in the presence of the appellants. The direction now ensures the\n\n       presence of the appellants in the Court, so that they have every opportunity\n\n       to watch the witnesses deposing in the trial and cross-examine said\n\n       witnesses.

According to Section 366 when a Court of Sessions passes a sentence\n\n       of death, the proceedings must be submitted to the High Court and the\n\n       sentence of death is not to be executed unless it is confirmed by the High\n\n       Court. Section 367 then proceeds to lay down the power of the High Court\n\n       to direct further enquiry to be made or additional evidence to be taken.\n\n       Section 368, thereafter, lays down the power of the High Court to confirm\n\n       the sentence so imposed or annul the conviction. One of the powers which\n\n       the High Court can exercise is one under Section 368 (c) of the Code and\n\n       that is to “acquit the accused person”. Pertinently, the power to acquit the\n\n       person can be exercised by the High Court even without there being any\n\n       substantive appeal on the part of the accused challenging his conviction. To\n\n       that extent the proceedings under Chapter XXVIII which deals with\n\n       “submission of death sentences for confirmation” is a proceeding in\n\n       continuation of the trial. These provisions thus entitle the High Court to\n\n       direct further enquiry or to take additional evidence and the High Court may,\n\n       in a given case, even acquit the accused person. The scope of the chapter is\n\n       wider. Chapter XXIX of the Code deals with “Appeals”. Section 391 also\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NOS.656-657 of 2019 (@SLP (CRL) Nos.809-810 of 2019\nATMA RAM &amp; ORS. VS.

Section 386 then enumerates powers of the Appellate\n\n       Court which inter alia includes the power to “reverse the finding and\n\n       sentence and acquit or discharge the accused, or order him to be re-tried by a\n\n       Court of competent jurisdiction subordinate to such Appellate Court or\n\n       committed for trial”. The powers of Appellate Court are equally wide. The\n\n       High Court in the present case was exercising powers both under Chapters\n\n       XXVIII and XXIX of the Code. If the power can go to the extent of\n\n       ordering a complete re-trial, the exercise of power to a lesser extent namely\n\n       ordering de novo examination of twelve witnesses with further directions as\n\n       the High Court has imposed in the present matter, was certainly within the\n\n       powers of the High Court.

The evidence against them would not be read for a\n\n       technical infraction resulting in great miscarriage. Viewed thus, the order\n\n       and directions passed by the High Court completely ensure that a fair\n\n       procedure is adopted and the depositions of the witnesses, after due\n\n       distillation from their cross-examination can be read in evidence.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">       26.    We, therefore, see no reason to interfere with the order passed and the\n\n       directions issued by the High Court in the present matter. We affirm the\n\n       view taken by the High Court and dismiss these appeals. The restraint which\n\n       we had placed on the Trial Court not to pronounce the judgment hereby\n\n       stands vacated.
