It must be said\n              that another MPID Court while passing the order dated\n              30.1.2006 over-looked the effect of order passed by this\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n              Court on 12.12.2005 (Coram: D.G. Deshpande &amp; V.M.\n              Kanade,JJ.). The said order dated 12.12.2005 was passed\n              in the present Criminal Writ Petition No.2414/2005 when\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n              application No.7912/2005 was preferred by petitioner -\n              Indur Chhugani for protecting the possession of the\n              petitioner in respect of flats No.501 &amp; 502. In the order of\n              this Court on the said Criminal application No.7912/2005,\n              it is amply clear that two flats were attached by MPID\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n              Court on 19.1.2005 and subsequently the petitioner was\n              found in possession of said two flats and on that premise,\n              show-cause notice was issued against him.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">              20. During hearing of the said application of Indur\n\n\n\n\n                                       \n              Chhugani praying for protection of the possession, an\n              attempt has been made by him to produce certain\n                             \n              documents as to payment of amount by D.D. to the\n              concerned bank and certain correspondence entered by\n              him with the banks. It must be said that the said\n              documents regarding correspondence with the banks,\n                            \n              produced and relied by Indur Chhugani was not accepted\n              as reliable evidence and it was the observation of this\n              Court that those documents were self-created evidence\n              and they were all one-sided and depict what the petitioner\n              did. It was further observed by this Court that there was\n      \n\n\n              no legal transaction by which said flats were validly\n              transferred to the petitioner Indur Chhugani by the\n   \n\n\n\n              concerned banks in any manner much less conveying the\n              title. Finally, this Court has observed that there was no\n              case of giving protection to the petitioner Indur Chhugani\n              with respect to his possession over the said flats and\n\n\n\n\n\n              hence said Application No.7912 of 2005 was rejected and\n              even the prayer for stay of the said order was rejected. It\n              is significant to note that the order of this Court on said\n              application is dated 12.12.2005 and in spite of passing of\n              such order, subsequently the order dated 30.1.2006 was\n              passed by another MPID Court, which is an order\n\n\n\n\n\n              impugned in the present Criminal Appeal No.688 of 2006\n              under consideration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">              21.

Now coming to the question of recovering the\n             possession of the property in Flat Nos.501 and 502 from\n             the petitioner certain argument of State are to be detailed.\n             During arguments, the learned APP placed reliance on the\n      \n\n\n             judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/613188/\" id=\"a_50\">Teeka and others vs.\n             The State of Uttar Pradesh</a> (AIR 1961 SC 803, para 13\n   \n\n\n\n             thereof). By pointing out the ratio propounded in the above\n             authority, it is submitted that where a property has been\n             legally attached by a Court, the possession of the same\n             passes from the owner to the Court or its agent. In that\n\n\n\n\n\n             situation, the owner of the said property cannot take the\n             law into his own hands, but can file a claim petition to\n             enforce his rights. If he resorts to force to get back his\n             property, he acts unlawfully and by taking the property\n             from the legal possession of the Court or its agent, he is\n             causing wrongful loss to the Court. As long as the\n\n\n\n\n\n             attachment is subsisting, he is not entitled to the\n             possession of the property, and by taking that property by\n             unlawful means, he is causing wrongful gain to himself.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">             31.
