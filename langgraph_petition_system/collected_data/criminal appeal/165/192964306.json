On seeing him, some of the\n                   accused attacked him with deadly weapons like knife\n                   and wooden log. Since the attack was so violent,\n                   unable to bear the same and in order to avoid further\n                   blows being made, P.W.1 crying for help, tried to rush\n                   inside the house.

He sustained\n                   bleeding injuries. With a view to save himself from\n                   further attack, he rushed into the house and went into\n                   the room where his wife was sleeping. The assailants\n                   did not stop. They gave a chase, entered into the said\n                   room and indiscriminately attacked P.W.3 and his wife\n                   (P.W.4) with weapons.

He was also attacked.\n                   Raising alarm, he rushed towards the house of one\n                   Thaluka Goundar. These assailants, barged into the\n                   house, looted the properties. Number of jewels worn\n                   by the witnesses were snatched away by the accused.\n                   They broke open the steel bureau in the house and\n                   committed theft of the jewels. All happened with a\n                   short time. Even before the villagers could gather at\n                   the place of occurrence, the accused fled away from the\n                   scene of occurrence with decamped valuable jewels\n                   and other articles. P.Ws. 1 to 5 and the deceased were\n                   struggling for life due to the bleeding injuries.

My father and mother were sleeping in\n                   the tractor shed in front of the house.

Mr. Kanna, learned advocate for the State, however, submitted that\n\n      as found by the Courts below, the eye-witness account through PWs.1 to 5\n\n      was clear, cogent and completely reliable. Every one of those prosecution\n\n      witnesses had suffered injuries; their presence could never be doubted; and\n\n      considering the nature of injuries the opportunity available to them to\n\n      observe the features of each of the Accused was quite sufficient.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">      14.       In the present case, the incident occurred after mid night. The\n\n      prosecution witnesses 1 to 5 suffered injuries in the transaction but the initial\n\n      reporting showed that the identity of the assailants was not known to the\n\n      witnesses. It is true that no identification marks or attributes were stated but\n\fCriminal Appeal No. 740 of 2018 etc.\nRaja etc. vs. State by the Inspector of Police\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                                  13</span>\n\n\n      it was asserted that the assailants were in the age group of 20 to 25 and one\n\n      of the assailants had worn a red colour shirt. Further, if the nature and\n\n      number of injuries suffered by each of the witnesses are considered, the\n\n      assailants must have been quite close to the witnesses to afford to the\n\n      witnesses sufficient time and opportunity to observe their features.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">      15.       It has been accepted by this Court that what is substantive piece of\n\n      evidence of identification of an accused, is the evidence given during the\n\n      trial. However, by the time the witnesses normally step into the box to\n\n      depose, there would be substantial time gap between the date of the incident\n\n      and the actual examination of the witnesses. If the accused or the suspects\n\n      were known to the witnesses from before and their identity was never in\n\n      doubt, the lapse of time may not qualitatively affect the evidence about\n\n      identification of such accused, but the difficulty may arise if the accused\n\n      were unknown. In such cases, the question may arise about the correctness\n\n      of the identification by the witnesses. The lapse of time between the stage\n\n      when the witnesses had seen the accused during occurrence and the actual\n\n      examination of the witnesses may be such that the identification by the\n\n      witnesses for the first time in the box may be difficult for the court to place\n\n      complete reliance on.

Again, there is no hard and fast rule about the period within which\n\n      the TIP must be held from the arrest of the accused. In certain cases, this\n\n      Court considered delay of 10 days to be fatal while in other cases even delay\n\n      of 40 days or more was not considered to be fatal at all.

An early opportunity to\n                        identify tends to minimise the chances of the\n                        memory of the identifying witnesses fading\n                        away due to long lapse of time. Relying on this\n                        decision, counsel for the appellant contends that\n                        no support can be derived from what transpired\n                        at the parade as it was held long after the arrest\n                        of the appellant. Now it is true that in the instant\n                        case there was a delay of about three months in\n                        holding the identification parade but here again,\n                        no questions were asked of the investigating\n                        officer as to why and how the delay occurred. It\n                        is true that the burden of establishing the guilt\n                        is on the prosecution but that theory cannot be\n                        carried so far as to hold that the prosecution\n                        must lead evidence to rebut all possible\n                        defences. If the contention was that the\n                        identification parade was held in an irregular\n                        manner or that there was an undue delay in\n                        holding it, the Magistrate who held the parade\n                        and the police officer who conducted the\n                        investigation should have been cross-examined\n                        in that behalf.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">      5</span>\n           (1973) 3 SCC 896\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">      6</span>\n          (1972) 4 SCC 773\n\fCriminal Appeal No. 740 of 2018 etc.\nRaja etc. vs. State by the Inspector of Police\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                                                16</span>\n\n\n                   In the instant case we find that the defence has not\n                   imputed any motive to the prosecution for the delay in\n                   holding the test identification parade, nor has the\n                   defence alleged that there was any irregularity in the\n                   holding of the test identification parade.

It is neither possible nor prudent to lay down any\n                   invariable rule as to the period within which a test\n                   identification parade must be held, or the number of\n                   witnesses who must correctly identify the accused, to\n                   sustain his conviction. These matters must be left to the\n                   courts of fact to decide in the facts and circumstances of\n                   each case. If a rule is laid down prescribing a period\n                   within which the test identification parade must be held,\n                   it would only benefit the professional criminals in whose\n                   cases the arrests are delayed as the police have no clear\n                   clue about their identity, they being persons unknown to\n                   the victims. They, therefore, have only to avoid their\n                   arrest for the prescribed period to avoid conviction.\n                   Similarly, there may be offences which by their very\n                   nature may be witnessed by a single witness, such as\n                   rape. The offender may be unknown to the victim and\n                   the case depends solely on the identification by the\n                   victim, who is otherwise found to be truthful and\n                   reliable. What justification can be pleaded to contend\n                   that such cases must necessarily result in acquittal\n                   because of there being only one identifying witness?\n                   Prudence therefore demands that these matters must be\n                   left to the wisdom of the courts of fact which must\n                   consider all aspects of the matter in the light of the\n                   evidence on record before pronouncing upon the\n                   acceptability or rejection of such identification.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                                     11</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1653286\" id=\"span_44\">21.

The facts,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">      11</span>\n           (2003) 5 SCC 746\n\fCriminal Appeal No. 740 of 2018 etc.\nRaja etc. vs. State by the Inspector of Police\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                                                   18</span>\n\n\n                        which establish the identity of the accused\n                        persons, are relevant under <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 9</a> of the\n                        Evidence Act. As a general rule, the substantive\n                        evidence of a witness is the statement made in\n                        court. The evidence of mere identification of the\n                        accused person at the trial for the first time is\n                        from its very nature inherently of a weak\n                        character. The purpose of a prior test\n                        identification, therefore, is to test and\n                        strengthen the trustworthiness of that evidence.\n                        It is accordingly considered a safe rule of\n                        prudence to generally look for corroboration of\n                        the sworn testimony of witnesses in court as to\n                        the identity of the accused who are strangers to\n                        them, in the form of earlier identification\n                        proceedings. This rule of prudence, however, is\n                        subject to exceptions, when, for example, the\n                        court is impressed by a particular witness on\n                        whose testimony it can safely rely, without such\n                        or other corroboration. The identification\n                        parades belong to the stage of investigation, and\n                        there is no provision in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_27\">Code of Criminal\n                        Procedure</a> which obliges the investigating\n                        agency to hold, or confers a right upon the\n                        accused to claim a test identification parade.\n                        They do not constitute substantive evidence and\n                        these parades are essentially governed by\n                        <a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 162</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n                        Failure to hold a test identification parade\n                        would not make inadmissible the evidence of\n                        identification in court. The weight to be\n                        attached to such identification should be a\n                        matter for the courts of fact. In appropriate\n                        cases it may accept the evidence of\n                        identification even without insisting on\n                        corroboration.”\n                                                       (emphasis supplied by us)\n\n\n                This Court thus found the evidence as regards identification to be\n\n      trustworthy and dismissed the appeal preferred by the accused.\n\fCriminal Appeal No. 740 of 2018 etc.\nRaja etc. vs. State by the Inspector of Police</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                                                                  19</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">      17.       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"310913\" id=\"span_48\">In <a href=\"/doc/310913/\" id=\"a_29\">Daya Singh v.

In the case of Soni4 this\n                   Court observed that a delay of 42 days in holding the\n                   identification parade throws a doubt on genuineness\n                   thereof, apart from the fact that it is difficult that after\n                   a lapse of such a long time the witnesses would be\n                   remembering facial expression of the appellant. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1543899\" id=\"span_49\">In the\n                   case of <a href=\"/doc/1543899/\" id=\"a_30\">Mohd.

But\n                   the value of test identification, apart from the other\n                   safeguards appropriate to a fair test of identification\n                   depends upon the promptitude in point of time with\n                   which the suspected persons are put up for test\n                   identification. If there is an unexplained and\n                   unreasonable delay in putting up the accused persons\n                   for a test identification, the delay by itself detracts from\n                   the credibility of the test.

The question, therefore, is — whether the evidence\n                   of injured eyewitnesses PW 37 and PW 38 is sufficient\n                   to connect the appellant with the crime beyond\n                   reasonable doubt. For this purpose, it is to be borne in\n                   mind that the purpose of test identification is to have\n                   corroboration to the evidence of the eyewitnesses in the\n                   form of earlier identification and that substantive\n                   evidence of a witness is the evidence in the court.

In such\n                   cases, not holding of identification parade is not fatal\n                   to the prosecution. The purpose of identification parade\n                   is succinctly stated by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1037935/\" id=\"a_34\">State of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                           10</span>\n                   Maharashtra v.

It is, thus, clear that if the material on record sufficiently indicates\n\n      that reasons for “gaining an enduring impression of the identity on the mind\n\n      and memory of the witnesses” are available on record, the matter stands in\n\n      a completely different perspective. This Court also stated that in such cases\n\n      even non-holding of identification parade would not be fatal to the case of\n\n      the prosecution. Applying the tests so laid down to the present case, in view\n\n      of the fact that each of the eyewitnesses had suffered number of injuries in\n\n      the transaction, it can safely be inferred that every one of them had sufficient\n\fCriminal Appeal No. 740 of 2018 etc.\nRaja etc. vs. State by the Inspector of Police\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                                                                    23</span>\n\n\n      opportunity to observe the accused to have an enduring impression of the\n\n      identity of the assailants.

Furthermore, in the present case all the accused were arrested on\n\n      21.06.1999 except Accused No.6 who surrendered before the Magistrate on\n\n      22.06.1999 and was remanded to judicial custody.                 After securing\n\n      permissions from the Magistrate, the police custody of Accused No.6 was\n\n      obtained on 01.07.1999 and the TIP was held on 01.07.1999 itself.

However, what is urged, is that at least three of the eyewitnesses had\n\n      accepted that the accused were shown to them while the accused were in\n\n      police custody. The responses of PWs 1, 2, and 3 as quoted hereinbefore do\n\n      indicate that they had seen and identified the accused while they were in\n\n      custody. The suggestion that the witness was able to identify the accused\n\n      only because they were shown while the accused were in police custody or\n\n      that their photographs had appeared in newspaper, was, however, denied by\n\n      PW1.

He also denied\n\n      that newspaper “Dhina Thanthi”, which apparently had published the\n\n      photographs of the accused, was available in their village at that time. No\n\n      defence evidence has been placed on record either to establish the date of\n\n      publication of such photographs in any newspaper and whether the\n\n      newspaper “Dhina Thanthi” was normally available in the concerned\n\n      village.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1515299\" id=\"span_62\">21.

By that\n                        provision the evidence of a witness regarding\n                        identification of a proclaimed offender in a\n                        terrorist case on the basis of the photograph was\n                        given the same value as the evidence of a test\n                        identification parade. This Court observed in\n                        that context: (SCC p. 711, para 361)\n\n                                ‘361. If the evidence regarding the\n                                identification on the basis of a\n                                photograph is to be held to have the\n                                same value as the evidence of a test\n                                identification parade, we feel that\n                                gross injustice to the detriment of the\n                                persons suspected may result.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">                                Therefore, we are inclined to strike\n                                down this provision and accordingly\n                                we strike down <a href=\"/doc/1021266/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 22</a> of the Act.’\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">                        12. In the present case prosecution does not say\n                        that they would rest with the identification\n                        made by Mr Mkhatshwa when the photograph\n                        was shown to him. Prosecution has to examine\n                        him as a witness in the court and he has to\n                        identify the accused in the court. Then alone it\n                        would become substantive evidence. But that\n                        does not mean that at this stage the court is\n                        disabled from considering the prospect of such\n                        a witness correctly identifying the appellant\n                        during trial. In so considering the court can take\n                        into account the fact that during investigation\n                        the photograph of the appellant was shown to\n                        the witness and he identified that person as the\n                        one whom he saw at the relevant time. It must\n                        be borne in mind that the appellant is not a\n                        proclaimed offender and we are not considering\n\fCriminal Appeal No. 740 of 2018 etc.\nRaja etc. vs. State by the Inspector of Police\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                                                                27</span>\n\n\n                        the eventuality in which he would be so\n                        proclaimed. So the observations made in Kartar\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                              16</span>\n                        Singh in a different context is of no avail to\n                        the appellant.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">                   254. Even a TIP before a Magistrate is otherwise hit by\n                   <a href=\"/doc/1762984/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 162</a> of the Code. Therefore, to say that a photo\n                   identification is hit by <a href=\"/doc/1762984/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 162</a> is wrong. It is not a\n                   substantive piece of evidence. It is only by virtue of\n                   <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 9</a> of the Evidence Act that the same i.e. the act\n                   of identification becomes admissible in court. The\n                   logic behind TIP, which will include photo\n                   identification lies in the fact that it is only an aid to\n                   investigation, where an accused is not known to the\n                   witnesses, the IO conducts a TIP to ensure that he has\n                   got the right person as an accused. The practice is not\n                   borne out of procedure, but out of prudence. At best it\n                   can be brought under <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 8</a> of the Evidence Act, as\n                   evidence of conduct of a witness in photo identifying\n                   the accused in the presence of an IO or the Magistrate,\n                   during the course of an investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">                   255. Mr Jethmalani has further argued on the\n                   proposition that mere dock identification is no\n                   identification in the eye of the law unless corroborated\n                   by previous TIP before the Magistrate. It has been\n                   further argued that in any case, even identification in\n                   court is not enough and that there should be something\n                   more to hold the accused liable. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"489014\" id=\"span_74\">In support of his\n                   arguments, he placed heavy reliance on the decision of\n                   this Court in <a href=\"/doc/489014/\" id=\"a_49\">Hari Nath v.

These judgments make it abundantly clear\n                   that even where there is no previous TIP, the court may\n                   appreciate the dock identification as being above board\n                   and more than conclusive.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">                   256.

As was observed by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/99578/\" id=\"a_50\">Matru\n                        v. State of U.P.20</a> identification tests do not\n                        constitute substantive evidence. They are\n                        primarily meant for the purpose of helping the\n                        investigating agency with an assurance that\n                        their progress with the investigation into the\n                        offence is proceeding on the right lines. The\n                        identification can only be used as\n                        corroborative of the statement in court.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"56524\" id=\"span_78\">(See\n                        <a href=\"/doc/56524/\" id=\"a_51\">Santokh Singh v. Izhar Hussain21</a>.) The\n                        necessity for holding an identification parade\n                        can arise only when the accused are not\n                        previously known to the witnesses. The whole\n                        idea of a test identification parade is that\n                        witnesses who claim to have seen the culprits\n                        at the time of occurrence are to identify them\n                        from the midst of other persons without any\n                        aid or any other source. The test is done to\n                        check upon their veracity. In other words, the\n                        main object of holding an identification\n                        parade, during the investigation stage, is to test\n                        the memory of the witnesses based upon first\n                        impression and also to enable the prosecution\n                        to decide whether all or any of them could be\n                        cited as eyewitnesses of the crime. The\n                        identification proceedings are in the nature of\n                        tests and significantly, therefore, there is no\n                        provision for it in the Code and the Evidence\n                        Act. It is desirable that a test identification\n                        parade should be conducted as soon as after\n                        the arrest of the accused. This becomes\n                        necessary to eliminate the possibility of the\n                        accused being shown to the witnesses prior to\n                        the test identification parade. This is a very\n                        common plea of the accused and, therefore,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">      19</span>\n           (2005) 9 SCC 631\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">      20</span>\n           (1971) 2 SCC 75\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">      21</span>\n           (1973) 2 SCC 406\n\fCriminal Appeal No. 740 of 2018 etc.\nRaja etc. vs. State by the Inspector of Police\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                                                             29</span>\n\n\n                        the prosecution has to be cautious to ensure\n                        that there is no scope for making such an\n                        allegation. If, however, circumstances are\n                        beyond control and there is some delay, it\n                        cannot be said to be fatal to the prosecution.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">                        17. It is trite to say that the substantive\n                        evidence is the evidence of identification in\n                        court. Apart from the clear provisions of\n                        <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 9</a> of the Evidence Act, the position in\n                        law is well settled by a catena of decisions of\n                        this Court. The facts, which establish the\n                        identity of the accused persons, are relevant\n                        under <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 9</a> of the Evidence Act. As a\n                        general rule, the substantive evidence of a\n                        witness is the statement made in court. The\n                        evidence of mere identification of the accused\n                        person at the trial for the first time is from its\n                        very nature inherently of a weak character.\n                        The purpose of a prior test identification,\n                        therefore, is to test and strengthen the\n                        trustworthiness of that evidence. It is,\n                        accordingly, considered a safe rule of\n                        prudence to generally look for corroboration\n                        of the sworn testimony of witnesses in court as\n                        to the identity of the accused who are strangers\n                        to them, in the form of earlier identification\n                        proceedings. This rule of prudence, however,\n                        is subject to exceptions, when, for example,\n                        the court is impressed by a particular witness\n                        on whose testimony it can safely rely, without\n                        such or other corroboration. The identification\n                        parades belong to the stage of investigation,\n                        and there is no provision in the Code which\n                        obliges the investigating agency to hold or\n                        confers a right upon the accused to claim a test\n                        identification parade. They do not constitute\n                        substantive evidence and these parades are\n                        essentially governed by <a href=\"/doc/1762984/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 162</a> of the\n                        Code. Failure to hold a test identification\n                        parade would not make inadmissible the\n                        evidence of identification in court. The weight\n                        to be attached to such identification should be\n\fCriminal Appeal No. 740 of 2018 etc.\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"30245708\" id=\"span_83\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"312114\" id=\"span_84\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117134\" id=\"span_85\">Raja etc. vs. State by the Inspector of Police\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                                                           30</span>\n\n\n                        a matter for the courts of fact.

It is trite to say that the substantive evidence\n                        is the evidence of identification in court. Apart\n                        from the clear provisions of <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 9</a> of the\n                        Evidence Act, the position in law is well settled\n                        by a catena of decisions of this Court. The facts,\n                        which establish the identity of the accused\n                        persons, are relevant under <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 9</a> of the\n                        Evidence Act. As a general rule, the substantive\n                        evidence of a witness is the statement made in\n                        court. The evidence of mere identification of the\n                        accused person at the trial for the first time is\n                        from its very nature inherently of a weak\n                        character. The purpose of a prior test\n                        identification, therefore, is to test and\n                        strengthen the trustworthiness of that evidence.\n                        It is accordingly considered a safe rule of\n                        prudence to generally look for corroboration of\n                        the sworn testimony of witnesses in court as to\n                        the identity of the accused who are strangers to\n                        them, in the form of earlier identification\n                        proceedings. This rule of prudence, however, is\n                        subject to exceptions, when, for example, the\n                        court is impressed by a particular witness on\n                        whose testimony it can safely rely, without such\n                        or other corroboration.

The weight to be\n                        attached to such identification should be a\n                        matter for the courts of fact. In appropriate\n                        cases it may accept the evidence of\n                        identification even without insisting on\n                        corroboration.”\n\n                                             ………</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">                   259. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"303355\" id=\"span_98\">In <a href=\"/doc/303355/\" id=\"a_66\">Mullagiri Vajram v.
