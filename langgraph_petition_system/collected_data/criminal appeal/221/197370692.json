The prosecution&#x27;s case, in short, is that, the\n\nprosecutrix (P.W.1) was the wife of the appellant Jai\n\nPrakash. A matrimonial dispute was initiated between them\n\nbut, ultimately, it was resolved in the Court with a\n\ncompromise and therefore, on 17.11.1998, the appellant Jai\n\nPrakash took the prosecutrix to his house. The prosecutrix\n\nwas kept in the house of the appellant Jai Prakash situated\n\nin the field at village Aamgaon Chhota (Police Station\n\nGadarwara, District Narsinghpur). She was harassed by so\n\nmany methods. She was directed to work in the fields. In\n\nthe month of December, 1998, the appellant Pyari Bai,\n\nmother-in-law of the prosecutrix assaulted her by slaps and\n\nfists and other appellants, except Komal and Satish asked\n\nher to bring a sum of Rs.1,50,000/- otherwise, directed her\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">                             -:-   3   -:-\n</p>                                                                                           \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                                                  Criminal Appeal No.561 of 2001\n                                                  Criminal Appeal No.589 of 2001\n\n\n\nto leave the house.    In the end of December, 1998. the\n\nappellant Jai Prakash sent his parents and relatives to the\n\nhouse situated in the village and thereafter, at about 10 p.m.\n\nin the night, he came to the house alongwith the appellants\n\nKomal and Satish Verma. The prosecutrix was taken to the\n\nbedroom of the house and thereafter, the appellant Jai\n\nPrakash assaulted her by kicks and fists and shown a knife\n\nto her and directed her to undress.                The appellant Satish\n\nVerma was taking photographs while the prosecutrix was\n\nremoving her clothes.       Thereafter, the appellant Komal\n\nDhimole pressed her breasts and tried to insert his penis in\n\nher vagina but, he could not complete the intercourse.\n\nSatish Verma took the photographs of the entire incident.\n\nThereafter, the appellant Jai Prakash took the camera with\n\nhim and the appellant Komal shown a knife to the\n\nprosecutrix and thereafter, the appellant Satish committed\n\nrape upon her.       The photographs were taken by the\n\nappellant Jai Prakash during the incident.                     Thereafter, the\n\nappellant   Jai   Prakash   also      committed              rape        with        the\n\nprosecutrix in front of other appellants.                   Thereafter, they\n\nthreatened her not to tell anyone about the incident. After\n\nthe incident, the prosecutrix was kept in watch and she was\n\nnot permitted to talk with anyone. During this period, she\n\nwas harassed by several methods.

She\n\ntold the entire story to her father, brother Ganesh and other\n\nrelatives Bhairo Prasad Verma and Jagdish Patel.                                   On\n\n15.1.1999, she had lodged a written report to SHO, Police\n\nStation Gadarwara, in which she had mentioned the entire\n\nstory and also mentioned that she could not lodge report on\n\n14.1.1999 because she was of the view that defamation\n\ncould be caused in lodging such an FIR.                    The prosecutrix\n\nwas sent to the District Hospital, Narsinghpur for her medico\n\nlegal examination, where Preeti Singhai (P.W.6) examined her\n\nand gave a report, Ex.P/13.         The appellants Jai Prakash,\n\nKomal and Satish were also sent for their medico legal\n\nexamination.   After due investigation, a charge-sheet was\n\nfiled before the JMFC, Gadarwara, who committed the case\n\nto the Sessions Judge, Narsinghpur and ultimately, it was\n\ntransferred to the Additional Sessions Judge, Gadarwara.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.        The appellants abjured their guilt. A specific plea\n\nwas taken that the prosecutrix was not residing in the family\n\nin a proper manner. She was shirking to do any work and\n\ntherefore, she resided with her parents and lodged various\n\nproceedings. After a compromise, she was residing with her\n\nhusband but, she was not willing.

The\n\nprosecutrix left the house of her husband on 14.1.1999\n\nwithout any information and thereafter, a false case was\n\nlodged against the appellants to harass them and get rid off\n\nwith the appellant Jai Prakash, her husband. In those days,\n\nthe crop of sugarcane was ripen and so many labours were\n\nworking in the fields of the appellant Jai Prakash to prepare\n\njaggery. There were only two rooms in the house situated at\n\nthe fields of the appellant and one room was filled up with\n\nfodder, whereas another room was filled up with jaggery.\n\nThere was no possibility to commit such a crime in a room.\n\nPersons who were looking after the manufacturing of jaggery\n\nwere sleeping in the varandah, even their food was also\n\nprepared in the varandah. In defence, Manoj Verma (D.W.1)\n\nwas examined.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.        The    learned         Additional            Sessions               Judge,\n\nGadarwara, after considering the evidence adduced by the\n\nparties, convicted the appellants Jai Prakash, Satish Verma\n\nand Komal Prasad for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_3\">section\n\n376</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_4\">section 34</a> of IPC, whereas the appellant Jai\n\nPrakash and remaining appellants were convicted for the\n\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_5\">section 498-A</a> of IPC and the\n\nappellants were sentenced as mentioned above.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">                            -:-   6   -:-\n</p>                                                                                          \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                                                 Criminal Appeal No.561 of 2001\n                                                 Criminal Appeal No.589 of 2001\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">6.        I have heard the learned counsel for the parties.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">7.        The learned counsel for the appellants have\n\nsubmitted that allegations made by the prosecutrix appears\n\nto be unnatural.   The appellant Komal Prasad was an old\n\nperson of more than 60 to 70 years of age and it was not\n\nexpected from him to get involved in such a crime.                             There\n\nwas no advantage to the appellant Jai Prakash, if a gang\n\nrape is caused upon his wife in his presence. No allegation\n\nwas made by the prosecutrix against the other appellants\n\nabout any harassment but, the learned Additional Sessions\n\nJudge, convicted the appellants for the offence punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_6\">section 498-A</a> of IPC, without any reason. The police\n\ncould not seize any camera or any photograph alleged to be\n\ntaken by Satish and Jai Prakash. Since the prosecutrix was\n\nnot willing to reside with her husband and therefore, a grave\n\ncase was prepared against the appellants to terrorize and\n\npressurize them.    It is prayed that the appeal may be\n\naccepted and the appellants may be acquitted.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">8.        On the other hand, the learned Panel Lawyer has\n\nsubmitted that the conviction as well as the sentence\n\ndirected by the trial Court appears to be correct. There is no\n\nreason by which the present appeals can be accepted. Now a\n\ndays, cases relating to gang rape are increasing and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                            -:-   7   -:-\n</blockquote>                                                                                          \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                                                 Criminal Appeal No.561 of 2001\n                                                 Criminal Appeal No.589 of 2001\n\n\n\ntherefore, such culprits should be punished with deterrent\n\nsentence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">9.          After considering the submissions made by the\n\nlearned counsel for the parties and looking to the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, it is to be considered as to\n\nwhether the appeals filed by the appellants can be accepted?\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">And whether the sentence directed against the appellants\n\ncan be reduced?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">10.         In the present case, the prosecutrix (P.W.1) has\n\nalleged a gang rape against the appellant Komal, Satish and\n\nher husband Jai Prakash. Since the prosecutrix could lodge\n\nan FIR after 16 days of the incident, nothing could be found\n\nin the medical report. Hence, medical evidence prepared by\n\nDr.Preeti Singhai (P.W.6) of the prosecutrix and medical\n\nevidence prepared by Dr.T.D.Choudhari (P.W.4) of the\n\nappellants Jai Prakash, Komal and Satish have no much\n\nimportance.    In the present case, the prosecutrix told the\n\nstory to her father and other relatives who were present in\n\nher house and therefore, Rajaram (P.W.2), father of the\n\nprosecutrix and Jagdish (P.W.3) were examined that the\n\nprosecutrix narrated about the incident to them. However, it\n\nis to be considered as to whether the prosecutrix can be\n\nbelieved. It is true that now a days, cases of gang rape are\n\nincreasing but, rape or gang rape is an offence, which can be\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">                              -:-   8   -:-\n</p>                                                                                            \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">                                                   Criminal Appeal No.561 of 2001\n                                                   Criminal Appeal No.589 of 2001\n\n\n\nalleged falsely due to enmity and therefore, factual position\n\nof the allegation is required to be assessed in each and every\n\ncase. It is also true that there is no corroboration required\n\nto the testimony of the prosecutrix but, she should be\n\nbelievable otherwise.       Under such circumstances, the\n\nconduct of the prosecutrix is to be examined carefully as to\n\nwhether she is believable or not.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">11.         The   learned   counsel        for      the       appellants             has\n\nsubmitted that what could be the advantage to the appellant\n\nJai Prakash in getting such an incident with the prosecutrix,\n\nwho was his wife. A person, who has to reside with his wife\n\nfor the entire life cannot bear such an insult of his wife\n\namongst his friends etc., unless he gets some advantage in\n\ndoing so.    If he was preparing any evidence about bad\n\ncharacter of the prosecutrix to get divorce in future then,\n\nsuch a bad character cannot be established with a person\n\nlike Komal, who was an old man of 60 to 70 years of age.\n\nHence, there was no advantage to the appellant Jai Prakash\n\nin getting such a document prepared. The statement made\n\nby the learned counsel for the appellants appears to be\n\ncorrect.    There was no advantage to the appellant Jai\n\nPrakash in doing such an insult of his own wife with the\n\nothers. If he wanted to prepare a document relating to bad\n\ncharacter of the prosecutrix for the purpose of prosecuting a\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">                           -:-   9   -:-\n</p>                                                                                         \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                                                Criminal Appeal No.561 of 2001\n                                                Criminal Appeal No.589 of 2001\n\n\n\npetition of divorce then, the appellant Komal could not be\n\ninvolved in the crime.    Looking to the age group of the\n\nappellants Jai Prakash and Satish, the appellant Komal was\n\nmisfit. Looking to the age of the appellant Komal, he could\n\nnot be a friend of the appellant Jai Prakash. The prosecutrix\n\ntold the entire story to her father and her father Rajaram\n\nhad knowledge of the story as told by the prosecutrix but,\n\nthere is a lot of contradiction between the story told by the\n\nprosecutrix in the Court and story told by the witness\n\nRajaram.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">12.        The prosecutrix told before the Court that the\n\nappellant Komal tried to commit rape with her but, she\n\nabused him and shouted and therefore, he did not commit\n\nrape upon her and only tried to insert his penis in her\n\nvagina.    On the contrary, the witness Rajaram has stated\n\nthat the appellant Komal touched his penis into the vagina of\n\nthe prosecutrix to prepared a photograph. Dr.T.D.Choudhari\n\n(P.W.4) has examined the appellant Komal and gave his\n\nreport, Ex.P/7.    He found him to be competent to do\n\nintercourse. If the appellants were bent upon to commit a\n\ngang rape with the prosecutrix and photographs be taken\n\nthen, there was no problem to the appellant Komal to\n\ncommit the intercourse with the prosecutrix. Looking to the\n\nversion given by the witness Rajaram, it appears that he was\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">                              -:-    10   -:-\n</p>                                                                                             \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">                                                     Criminal Appeal No.561 of 2001\n                                                     Criminal Appeal No.589 of 2001\n\n\n\nthe author of the story which was reproduced by the\n\nprosecutrix in the Court.           The conduct of the appellant\n\nKomal as shown by this witness indicates that it is not a true\n\nstory but, it is a hypothetical allegation against the appellant\n\nKomal. It is possible that the appellant Komal was falsely\n\nimplicated in the matter because due to his efforts, the\n\nprosecutrix was again directed to reside with the appellant\n\nJai Prakash and therefore, she was inimical to the appellant\n\nKomal. Looking to the age of the appellant Komal, he could\n\nnot be involved with the appellants Jai Prakash and Satish\n\nor if he was involved then, he should have done the complete\n\nintercourse    with    the         prosecutrix.                   Under             such\n\ncircumstances, looking to the evidence of the prosecutrix\n\nand her father, it appears that the appellant Komal was not\n\ninvolved in the crime and a false case has been lodged by the\n\nprosecutrix against the appellant Komal. Hence a doubt is\n\ncreated in the testimony of the prosecutrix.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">13.       The prosecutrix has accepted that there were only\n\ntwo rooms in the house situated at the field of the appellant\n\nJai Prakash. She has accepted that one room was filled with\n\nfodder and therefore, only second room was available for\n\ndwelling. She denied the suggestion that second room was\n\nalso filled up with jaggery.                 Rajaram, father of the\n\nprosecutrix has accepted that jaggery was prepared in the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">                            -:-   11   -:-\n</p>                                                                                          \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">                                                  Criminal Appeal No.561 of 2001\n                                                  Criminal Appeal No.589 of 2001\n\n\n\nfields of the appellant Jai Prakash but, it was also kept with\n\nfodder in the room where the fodder was kept.                            By such\n\nacceptance of the witness Rajaram, it is apparent that\n\njaggery was prepared at the time in the field of the appellant\n\nJai Prakash    and therefore, the testimony of the defence\n\nwitness Manoj Verma appears to be acceptable that some 14\n\nto 15 persons were working in the field of the appellant Jai\n\nPrakash in those days to prepare jaggery etc. and second\n\nroom was used for storage of jaggery. All the labours were\n\nsleeping in the night in the varandah and therefore, there\n\nwas no possibility for the appellant Jai Prakash and Satish\n\nto do such a crime in front of those 14-15 labours.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">14.       As submitted by the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants, there was no advantage to the appellant Jai\n\nPrakash by preparation of such photographs.                                On the\n\ncontrary, it was possible that since the prosecutrix escaped\n\nfrom the house of the appellant Jai Prakash without any\n\nintimation and therefore, it was for her to create a reason for\n\nsuch a disappearance.     As discussed above, there was no\n\nroom available at the spot, in which such type of offence\n\ncould be committed. It is pertinent to note at this stage that\n\nthe investigation officer neither prepared a spot map by his\n\nown, nor he directed any Patwari to prepare the spot map.\n\nSuch non preparation of the spot map indicates that when\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">                             -:-    12   -:-\n</p>                                                                                            \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                                                    Criminal Appeal No.561 of 2001\n                                                    Criminal Appeal No.589 of 2001\n\n\n\nthe investigation officer went to the spot, he found that one\n\nroom was filled up with fodder and another room was filled\n\nup with jaggery and no such crime could be committed in\n\nany room and therefore, if he would have prepared a spot\n\nmap then, the spot map would have gone against the\n\nprosecution story and therefore, in such an important case,\n\nno spot map was prepared either by the investigation officer\n\nor by the patwari. This situation also creates a doubt in the\n\nstory of the prosecution.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">15.       The prosecutrix has stated in omnibus manner in\n\nthe FIR, Ex.P/1 that after commission of the crime, some of\n\nthe family members were having a watch upon her, so that\n\nshe could not escape. She had stated in the FIR in omnibus\n\nmanner but, in her statement before the Court, she has\n\nstated against her parents-in-law that they were watching\n\nher in those 15 days.             The witness Rajaram had the\n\nknowledge about the incident as told by the prosecutrix but,\n\nhe could not tell the names of the persons, who were\n\nwatching the prosecutrix in those 15 days, so that she could\n\nnot escape. It clearly indicates that the story of watching is\n\nnot a correct version but, a fake story is created and\n\ntherefore, Rajaram could not tell the names of the persons\n\nwho had kept a watch over the prosecutrix in those 15 days,\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                           -:-   13   -:-\n</p>                                                                                         \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">                                                 Criminal Appeal No.561 of 2001\n                                                 Criminal Appeal No.589 of 2001\n\n\n\nwhereas the prosecutrix told that her father-in-law and\n\nmother-in-law had kept a watch upon her.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">16.       For the sake of arguments, if it is accepted that a\n\nwatch was kept by the appellant Jai Prakash and his father\n\nand mother then, it was not possible for the prosecutrix to\n\nescape at about 4 a.m. in the night. If that room was vacant\n\nthen, she could be kept in a lock and key and the appellant\n\nJai Prakash and his parents could sleep in the Varandah.\n\nThe prosecutrix could not tell any special reason as to how\n\nshe could escape from the house of the appellant.                                 She\n\navoided the question to that fact as to how she escaped and\n\nhow she dodged her husband and parents-in-law.                                    Her\n\nconduct in not telling any special reason as to how she\n\nescaped indicates that there was no watch kept upon her\n\nand story told by the prosecutrix appears to be incorrect.\n\nShe told that the incident took place 15 days prior to her\n\nescape because she knew that in medical evidence, she could\n\nnot get anything if she tells about the story of rape upon her\n\nrecently and therefore, she prepared a story that the incident\n\ntook place,15 days prior to her escape.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">17.       The FIR lodged by the prosecutrix also suffers from\n\nvarious infirmities. The nearest outpost from the village of\n\nRajaram (P.W.2) was Salichowka. The prosecutrix and her\n\nfather Rajaram could not give any explanation as to why they\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                            -:-   14   -:-\n</p>                                                                                          \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                                                  Criminal Appeal No.561 of 2001\n                                                  Criminal Appeal No.589 of 2001\n\n\n\ndid not approach to the outpost Salichowka. It is accepted\n\nby the witness Rajaram that they did not try to contact the\n\nSarpanch or Patel of the village to tell the story.                          It was\n\nstated by the prosecutrix that initially she went to the Police\n\nStation Gadarwara but, nobody was ready to lodge the FIR\n\nexcept it is submitted in writing and therefore, she went with\n\nher father and brother Ganesh to a petition writer available\n\nin the Court and got the FIR Ex.P/1 typed. If the text of the\n\nFIR, Ex.P/1 is perused then, it would be clear that it is\n\nprepared by some law knowing person. The witness Rajaram\n\nhas stated that to lodge the FIR, the prosecutrix and her\n\nbrother went alongwith the witness Rajaram.                         The written\n\nFIR was lodged on 15.1.1999, whereas the prosecutrix\n\nreached to her father&#x27;s house on 14.1999 at about 9 a.m. in\n\nthe morning. The reason of delay mentioned in the FIR is\n\nthat it is a case of defamation and therefore, she could not\n\nlodge the FIR on the previous day.                            However, this\n\nexplanation is a contradictory to the fact that she told the\n\nentire story to her father when an unknown person Jagdish\n\n(P.W.3) was present in the house.                 The presence of the\n\nwitness Jagdish appears that it was created to make him a\n\nwitness.   The witness Jagdish (P.W.3) has accepted in his\n\ncross-examination that his master Bhairo was cousin of\n\nRajaram and therefore, he went to the house of Rajaram\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                              -:-   15   -:-\n</blockquote>                                                                                            \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">                                                    Criminal Appeal No.561 of 2001\n                                                    Criminal Appeal No.589 of 2001\n\n\n\nalong with Bhairo but, he has stated that he had no relation\n\nwith Rajaram, prior to that incident.                He never visited the\n\nhouse   of    Rajaram   prior      to   that        day.           Under          such\n\ncircumstances, Jagdish was not known to the prosecutrix\n\nprior to the incident and therefore, how could she tell the\n\nentire story before such an unknown person, whereas she\n\nwas feeling shy to tell the story to the police one day prior to\n\nlodging the FIR. The witness Jagdish has given a pretext to\n\nvisit the house of Rajaram that he went alongwith Bhairo to\n\ntake a permit from sugar factory and he could not get the\n\npermit therefore, he went to the house of Rajaram on the\n\nnext morning.      However, he has accepted that permit is\n\nrequired after ripping of sugarcane and at that time, the crop\n\nof sugarcane was standing in the field of Bhairo, it was not\n\nripen. Under such circumstances, the pretext about his visit\n\nto Rajaram appears to be baseless and it appears that the\n\nwitness Jagdish is unnecessarily introduced to establish the\n\nstory of the prosecutrix. Neither he was present at that time\n\nin the house of Rajaram when the prosecutrix reached, nor\n\nhe was relative to Rajaram, so that such a story could be told\n\nto him by the prosecutrix.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">18.          The FIR, Ex.P/1 lodged by the prosecutrix is\n\ncertainly lodged with delay of more than one day and\n\nexplanation given for that delay appears to be incorrect.

In this connection,\n\nit is also pertinent to note that the prosecutrix has accepted\n\nthat his brother Ganesh was facing a trial of crime of rape\n\nand relations of her another brother with his wife were not\n\npeaceful and therefore, a criminal case was going on between\n\nher brother Shiv Kumar and his wife.                      Therefore, it was\n\npossible for Ganesh, brother of the prosecutrix to create\n\nsuch a story of rape, so that the appellants may suffer in a\n\ngrave manner. If FIR is lodged with unnecessarily delay and\n\nthere is possibility that it is lodged with due deliberations\n\nthen, certainly, such delay in lodging the FIR makes a great\n\ndoubt in the prosecution&#x27;s story.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">19.        If   various   doubts       as      discussed              above          are\n\nconsidered simultaneously then, the possibility cannot be\n\nruled out that since the prosecutrix escaped from her\n\nhusband&#x27;s house, therefore, a story was created for her\n\nexcuse and to pressurize her husband and his family\n\nmembers.

The\n\ntestimony of the prosecutrix appears to be doubtful and\n\ntherefore, the prosecution has failed to prove beyond doubt\n\nthat any intercourse was committed either by the appellants\n\nKomal or by Satish with the prosecutrix in presence of others\n\nor the appellant Jai Prakash had committed any intercourse\n\nwith the prosecutrix in presence of the appellants Komal and\n\nSatish. In case of doubt, benefit of doubt is to be given to\n\nthe appellant.

As per the evidence of the prosecutrix (P.W.1),\n\nBalkishan, father-in-law was liable for the harassment which\n\nhe had done due to keeping a watch upon the prosecutrix\n\nbut, it is not proved beyond doubt that a gang rape was\n\ncommitted upon the prosecutrix and it is also doubtful that\n\nany watch was done by the parents of the appellant Jai\n\nPrakash upon the prosecutrix and therefore, by such a fact it\n\ncannot be said that any harassment has been done by the\n\nappellant Bal Kishan to the prosecutrix.

Looking to\n\nher conduct, where she is disbelieved on each and every\n\ncount, she cannot be believed for the harassment done by\n\nthe appellant Pyari Bai. Hence, looking to the conduct of the\n\nprosecutrix, it is not proved beyond doubt that the appellant\n\nPyari Bai assaulted her by slaps and fists and therefore, it is\n\nnot proved that the appellant Pyari Bai has done any\n\nharassment with the prosecutrix for demand of any dowry or\n\notherwise.
