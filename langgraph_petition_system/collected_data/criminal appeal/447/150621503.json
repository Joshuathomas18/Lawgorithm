However, though roving\n\n\n\n\n\n               enquiry is not permissible, the court can consider whether\n               the material collected by the prosecution if accepted as it is\n               without being subjected to cross-examination gives rise to\n\n\n\n\n\n               strong and grave suspicion for presuming that the accused\n               has committed the offence and that unrebutted material will\n               lead to a conviction. If at the stage of Section 227 or Section\n               228, the scales as to the guilt or innocence of the accused are\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 16/07/2014 23:51:40 :::</span>\n     PNP                               13/50                              APEAL25.doc\n\n\n               even then the court must proceed to frame a charge. There\n               is no question of giving benefit of doubt to the accused and\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n               discharge the accused at that stage because the scales are\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n               even. That can be done only at the conclusion of trial. If\n               there is a strong suspicion which leads the court to think that\n               there is a ground for presuming that the accused has\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n               committed an offence, then the court will proceed to frame\n               the charge. But if two views are possible and the court is\n\n\n\n\n                                         \n               satisfied that the evidence gives rise to some suspicion but\n                              \n               not grave suspicion against the accused, the court will be\n               within its right to discharge the accused. Suspicion has to be\n                             \n               strong and grave suspicion leading the court to presume that\n               the accused has committed an offence. While basic\n               infirmities and broad probabilities can be considered, the\n            \n\n\n               court cannot make a roving enquiry into the pros and cons of\n         \n\n\n\n               the matter and weigh the evidence as if it is conducting a\n               trial.

Thus, in our considered opinion, there\n    is a strong prima facie case against the Appellants to frame a charge as\n    contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/411062/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 228</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n            \n\n\n    under Sections 143, 147, 148, 149, 302 read with 120-B of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_55\">Indian\n         \n\n\n\n    Penal Code</a> and under <a href=\"/doc/1092263/\" id=\"a_56\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1555874/\" id=\"a_57\">4</a> and <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_58\">25</a> of the Arms Act and under\n    Section 37(1) read with <a href=\"/doc/124700273/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 135</a> of the Bombay Police Act and under\n\n\n\n\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/21636269/\" id=\"a_60\">Sections 3(1)(i)(ii)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/155408800/\" id=\"a_61\">3(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/117723703/\" id=\"a_62\">3(4)</a> of the MCOC Act 1999.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">    15.

Therefore, the meaning of the term &#x27;abatement&#x27; as\n    mentioned in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_65\">Indian Penal Code</a> under Section 107 has been further\n    expanded by the definition of <a href=\"/doc/188137808/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 2(1)(a)</a> of the MCOC Act and\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    therefore the presence of the Appellants at the scene of offence and\n    that, they were assisting in the commission of crime, undoubtedly falls,\n\n\n\n\n                                         \n    within the purview of the definition of <a href=\"/doc/8623567/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 2(1)(a)(iii)</a> read with\n                            \n    <a href=\"/doc/155408800/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 3(2)</a> of the MCOC Act.\n</p>                           \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1287305\" id=\"span_32\">16.   The second contention as has been raised in paragraph 4 above is\n    that, there is total non-application of mind by the competent authorities\n    while granting prior approval under <a href=\"/doc/118242256/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 23(1)(a)</a> and sanction under\n            \n\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/83726174/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 23(2)</a> of the MCOC Act. It was further contended that the\n         \n\n\n\n    sanction in view of the facts of the present case ought not to have been\n    granted at all and that the application of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_71\">MCOC Act</a>\n\n\n\n\n\n    to the present case is not justifiable.

The\n    said submission has only to be recorded, to be rejected, at its threshold.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1453468\" id=\"span_96\">The reason being twofold. Firstly, the said submission is made without\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    taking into consideration the ratio <a href=\"/doc/90803/\" id=\"a_171\">laid down by</a> the Division Bench of\n    this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1453468/\" id=\"a_172\">Govind Sakharam Ubhe</a>                   (supra) which\n    clearly clarifies and settles the position of law as to the filing of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    charge-sheets. The Division Bench has in unequivocal terms laid down\n    the ratio that the requirement of more than one charge-sheet is qua the\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n    unlawful activities of the organised crime syndicate and not qua the\n                            \n    individual member thereof. The second reason is that, construing the\n    said <a href=\"/doc/120695715/\" id=\"a_173\">Section 2(1)(d)</a> of the MCOC Act in the manner as submitted by Mr.\n                           \n    S.V. Kotwal, learned counsel for the Appellant in Criminal Appeal 25 of\n    2014, would indubitably not only frustrate but would also further lead\n    to give nugatory effect to the intention of the legislature in enacting the\n            \n\n\n    said provision. We therefore refrain ourselves from accepting such a\n         \n\n\n\n    narrow and constricted interpretation of the said provision viz. <a href=\"/doc/120695715/\" id=\"a_174\">Section\n    2(1)(d)</a> of the MCOC Act.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">    34.   The fifth contention raised in paragraph 4 above by Shri J.

Mr. J.

However, its\n\n\n\n\n\n    applicability would be a factor which is different in each case. In other\n    words, the facts and circumstances of each case and each prior approval\n    order or sanction will have to be considered before applying the\n\n\n\n\n\n    principle, that invocation of the <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_196\">MCOC Act</a> was not justified if\n    prerequisites are not attracted and satisfied.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1510141\" id=\"span_101\">It is to be noted here that\n    in the case before the Supreme Court i.e. in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1510141/\" id=\"a_197\">Lalit Nagpal</a>\n    (supra), the offences alleged / charged by the police were punishable\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 16/07/2014 23:51:40 :::</span>\n     PNP                              49/50                              APEAL25.doc\n\n\n    under Sections 468, 420 and <a href=\"/doc/11894189/\" id=\"a_198\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/361626/\" id=\"a_199\">7</a>, <a href=\"/doc/371939/\" id=\"a_200\">9</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1943863/\" id=\"a_201\">10</a> of the Essential\n    Commodities Act 1955.

In the present case, the\n                          \n    significant factor of distinction is that a person has been murdered and\n    Section 302 along with other provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_204\">Indian Penal Code</a> are\n    applied. Further it is to be noted that <a href=\"/doc/21636269/\" id=\"a_205\">Section 3(1)(i)</a> of the MCOC Act\n            \n\n\n    which postulates that an offence which has resulted into the death of\n         \n\n\n\n    any person has also been applied to the present crime and therefore,\n    the reliance placed by the learned counsel for the Appellant in the case\n\n\n\n\n\n    of <a href=\"/doc/1510141/\" id=\"a_206\">Lalit Nagpal</a> (supra) for seeking discharge from the present crime is\n    totally misplaced.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">    42.
