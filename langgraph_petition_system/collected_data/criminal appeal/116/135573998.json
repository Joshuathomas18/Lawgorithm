Leave granted.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2.      On   March   20,   1975,   at   about   4.15   p.m.  when   the   car   in   which   Mr. \n\n\nJustice A.N. Ray, holding the office of the Chief Justice of India at that time, \n\n\nwas   travelling,   along   with   his   son   Shri   Ajoy   Nath   Ray   and   a   Jamadar   Jai \n\n\nNand and the driver Inder Singh, stopped at the intersection of Tilak Marg \n\n\nand Bhagwan Dass road, at a stone throw distance from the Supreme Court \n\n\nof India, two live hand grenades were lobbed inside the car.  Fortunately, the \n\n\ngrenades did not explode and the occupants of the car, including the Chief \n\n\nJustice of India, escaped unharmed.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">3.      A   case   was   registered   and   investigation   was   started   by   the   Crime \n\n\nBranch of the Delhi Police.    But, as the police investigation  did not make \n\n\nmuch headway, on June 30, 1975 the case was handed over to the CBI.  On \n\n\nthe   same   day,   one   Santoshanand   Avadhoot   (appellant   in   Criminal   appeal \n\n\narising out of SLP (Criminal) 6625 of 2006) was arrested  followed by the \n\n\narrest of an advocate, namely, Ranjan Dwivedi (appellant in criminal appeal \n\n\narising out of SLP (Crl.) No.6800/2006) on July 6, 1975. \n</p>\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                              3</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">4.      Here,   it   may   be   noted   that   about   two   and   a   half   months   before   the \n\n\nattempt   on   the   life   of   the   Chief   Justice   of   India,   Shri   L.N.   Mishra,   the \n\n\nMinister of Railways in the Union Cabinet was killed in a bomb blast taking \n\n\nplace during a function on the platform of Samastipur Railway Station.   In \n\n\nconnection   with   that   case,   Sudevanand   Avadhoot   (appellant   in   criminal \n\n\nappeal   arising   out   of   SLP   (Crl.)   No.6489/2006)   and   one   Vikram   alias \n\n\nJaladhar Das were arrested at Bhagalpur. On July 27, 1975 they were also \n\n\narrested  in the present case relating  to the attempt on the life  of the Chief \n\n\nJustice  and were brought  to Delhi where they were sent on police remand \n\n\nfrom July 31, 1975 to August 14, 1975. While on remand, Vikram made a \n\n\nconfessional statement and requested to be allowed to become an Approver. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">He was produced before a Magistrate on August 14, 1975, before whom he \n\n\nmade a statement under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 164</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure (in \n\n\nshort &quot;<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_2\">Cr.P.C</a>.&quot;) giving the details of the conspiracy to kill the Chief Justice \n\n\nof   India.   He   was   again   produced   before   the   Chief   Judicial   Magistrate   on \n\n\nAugust   22,   1975   before   whom   he   made   a   similar   statement   for   grant   of \n\n\npardon under Section 306 Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">5.      The   CBI   completed   investigation   of   the   case   and   submitted   charge-\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">sheet   against   the   three   accused,   namely,   Sudevanand,   Santoshanand   and \n\n\nRanjan   Dwivedi   and   they   were   put   on   trial   in   Sessions   Case   No.9/1976. \n</p>\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                             4</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">Sudevanand   and   Santoshanand   were   charged   under   <a href=\"/doc/647828/\" id=\"a_3\">Section   307</a>   read   with \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 120-B</a> of the Indian Penal Code and <a href=\"/doc/747401/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 4(b)</a> of the Explosive \n\n\nSubstances   Act,   1908.     So   far   as   Ranjan   Dwivedi   is   concerned,   he   was \n\n\ncharged jointly with the other two accused under Section 120 B of the Penal \n\n\nCode   only.     At   the   conclusion   of  the   trial,   the   Additional   Sessions   Judge, \n\n\nDelhi  vide  his   judgment   and   order   dated   October   28,   1976   convicted \n\n\nSudevanand and Santoshanand under Sections 115, 307/120B of the Penal \n\n\nCode   and   sentenced   them   to   undergo   rigorous   imprisonment   for   7   years \n\n\nunder Section 115 read with 120-B(1), 10 years for attempting to kill Chief \n\n\nJustice   A.   N.  Ray   and   three   other   occupants   of  the  car   and   7  years   under \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/747401/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 4(b)</a> of the Explosive Substances Act, 1908.   Ranjan Dwivedi was \n\n\nconvicted under Section 115/120 B(1) of the Penal Code and was sentenced \n\n\nto 4 years rigorous imprisonment.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">6.      It may be noted here that Vikram, the Approver was examined by the \n\n\nprosecution   as   PW.1   and   according   to   the   appellants   their   conviction   is \n\n\nmainly based on his evidence. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">7.      Against   the   judgment   and   order   passed   by   the   trial   court,   Ranjan \n\n\nDwivedi filed appeal before the High Court on December 6, 1976 which is \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                               5</span>\n\n\n\nregistered as Criminal Appeal No.436/1976. Sudevanand and Santoshanand \n\n\njointly filed a separate appeal which is registered as 443/1976.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">8.      After   the   appellants&#x27;   trial   was   over,   and   they   were   convicted   and \n\n\nsentenced   by  the  trial   court,  as  noted  above,  and after  they  had  filed  their \n\n\nappeals before the High Court against the judgment and order passed by the \n\n\ntrial court, certain developments took place in the L. N. Mishra murder case. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">That case was also investigated by the CBI and in that case too Sudevanand \n\n\nand   Santoshanand   (along   with   others)   were   accused   and   in   that   case   also \n\n\nVikram   was   granted   pardon   on   becoming   an   Approver.   According   to   his \n\n\nstatements made before the Magistrates both the killing of L. N. Mishra and \n\n\nthe   attempt   on   the   life   of   Chief   Justice   of   India   were   parts   of   a   larger \n\n\nconspiracy, at the instance of the same organisation and a common group of \n\n\npersons.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">9.      On   August   30,   1978,   the   Chief   Minister   of   Bihar   wrote   a   highly \n\n\nconfidential   letter   to   the   Prime   Minister   of   India,   a   copy   of   which   was \n\n\nendorsed   to   the   DIG   (CID)   Bihar.     In   pursuance   of   the   Chief   Minister&#x27;s \n\n\nletter, the DIG (CID) is said to have made an inquiry into the circumstances \n\n\nin which Vikram @ Jaladhar Das had made the confessional statement and \n\n\nwas   tendered   pardon   to   become   Approver.   Following   the   enquiry,   on \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                           6</span>\n\n\n\nSeptember 30, 1978 the statement of Vikram was recorded at Danapur jail \n\n\nwhere he was lodged at that time. The statement was taken in the question \n\n\nand   answer   form   and   it   was   recorded   in   the   presence   of   Dr.   D.   Ram, \n\n\nSuperintendent;   Danapur   Hospital,   (Ex-officio   Jail   Superintendent)   and \n\n\nHaider Ali, the Jailor. The statement was also recorded on a tape recorder. In \n\n\nthis   statement   Vikram   retracted   from   his   earlier   statements   incriminating \n\n\nhimself and the other accused in the case. He said that his earlier statements \n\n\nwere  obtained  by  the   CBI  by   subjecting   him to  great  mental  and  physical \n\n\ntorture. He was beaten up and tortured to such an extent that he agreed to \n\n\nmake whatever statement CBI wanted him to make. The retraction made by \n\n\nVikram was placed before the Chief Minister who requested Mr. Tarkunde, \n\n\na  former  judge  of  the  Bombay   High Court to  give a  report   in light   of  the \n\n\nstatement made by Vikram in jail on September 30, 1978. Mr. Tarkunde is \n\n\nsaid to have given his opinion that the conviction of all the accused in the \n\n\nChief Justice&#x27;s case was based on fabricated evidence of the Approver and, \n\n\ntherefore, the High Court should be requested to consider the appeals of the \n\n\nthree accused keeping aside the Approver&#x27;s evidence. We need not go any \n\n\nfurther in this matter, as all this was plainly outside the legal frame-work.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\"> 10.    It needs, however, to be noted that upset by these developments, the \n\n\nCBI moved this Court in Transfer Petition (Crl.) No. 69/1979 praying for the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                               7</span>\n\n\n\ntransfer   of   the   trial   of   the   L.N.   Mishra   murder   case   outside   Bihar.   In   the \n\n\ntransfer petition though the State of Bihar was not formally made a party, a \n\n\nnumber   of   allegations   were   made   against   some   of   its   officers.   In   those \n\n\ncircumstances,   the   concerned   officers   after   obtaining   permission   from   the \n\n\nState Government, filed affidavits/applications denying the allegations made \n\n\nagainst   them   in   the   transfer   petition   filed   by   the   CBI   and   supporting   the \n\n\nveracity of the retraction made by Vikram in Danapur jail on September 30, \n\n\n1978 disowning the earlier statements made by him. In the overall facts and \n\n\ncircumstances   of   the   case,   however,   this   Court   deemed   just   and   proper   to \n\n\ntransfer the trial of the L.N. Mishra murder case from Bihar to Delhi where \n\n\nit   now   remains   pending   as   Sessions   Case   No.   1/2006   (after   being \n\n\nrenumbered) before the Additional Sessions Judge, Delhi. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">11.     It is curious to note that in the L.N. Mishra murder case Vikram was \n\n\nexamined by the prosecution as PW.2 and in course of his deposition before \n\n\nthe   court   he   said   that  the   statement   made   by   him  at  Danapur   jail   was  not \n\n\nvoluntary   but   he   was   forced   to   make   the   statement   under   coercion   and \n\n\nthreats   by   the   Chief   Secretary,   Law   Secretary   and   Home   Secretary, \n\n\nGovernment of Bihar and the SP and the DSP in the State Police. He said in \n\n\nhis   deposition   before   the   court   that   his   statement   in   jail   was   made   on   the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                             8</span>\n\n\n\nbasis   of   a   statement   prepared   and   given   to   him   in   writing   by   the   State \n\n\nGovernment officers.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">12.     Coming back to the appellant&#x27;s appeal pending before the Delhi High \n\n\nCourt,   both   Sudevanand   and   Santoshanand   were   released   on   bail   in   1986 \n\n\nafter remaining in jail for almost 11 years. In 1997-1998, that is to say 11 \n\n\nyears   after   coming   out   of   jail,   the   appellants   filed   three   criminal \n\n\nmiscellaneous  applications in the pending appeals.  Criminal miscellaneous \n\n\napplication No. 5786/97 was filed on September 24, 1997 praying to call for \n\n\nand   taking   on   the   appeal   record   the   statement   made   by   Vikram,   the \n\n\nApprover,   in   Danapur   jail   on   September   30,   1978,   the   affidavits   of   the \n\n\nofficials   of  the   Bihar   Government   filed   in   the   transfer   petition   before   this \n\n\nCourt   and   the   enquiry   report   of   Justice   Tarkunde.   The   second   application \n\n\n(criminal   miscellaneous)   No.5700/98   was   filed   on   September   16,   1998   to \n\n\nsummon   Vikram,   the   Approver   (PW.1   in   the   case),   for   further   cross-\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">examination   in   terms   of   <a href=\"/doc/1110615/\" id=\"a_7\">Section   145</a>   of   the   Evidence   Act.   The   third \n\n\napplication   (criminal   miscellaneous)   No.6300/98   was  filed   on   October   15, \n\n\n1998 praying to call the evidence of Vikram, the Approver (PW.2), recorded \n\n\nin the trial of L.N. Mishra murder case.\n</p>\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                              9</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">13.     The   Delhi   High   Court   took   up   all   the   three   criminal   miscellaneous \n\n\napplications and disposed them of by order dated November 22, 2006. The \n\n\nHigh Court noted that it was within the knowledge of the appellants that the \n\n\nApprover   had   made   the   retraction   in   the   year   1978   disowning   his   earlier \n\n\nstatements   but   the   three   applications   in   question   were   filed   after   a   lag   of \n\n\nmore than 20 years and primarily for that reason did not allow all the prayers \n\n\nmade in the three applications but granted the appellants only a limited and \n\n\npartial relief. In the operative portion of the order the High Court observed \n\n\nand directed as follows:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       &quot;The  last application moved by the appellant  for considering the \n\n       record, certified copies etc. u/s 80 and other provisions under the \n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_8\">Evidence   Act</a>,   report   of   justice   V.M.   Tarkunde   and   other \n\n       documents which may be admissible under the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_9\">Evidence Act</a> has \n\n       to   be   permitted.   This   prayer   is   being   kept   open   and   would   be \n\n       considered as per law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\n       Succinctly   stated,   the   applications   for   leading   further   evidence \n\n       which would have entailed further time are hereby dismissed, but \n\n       the third application for considering those documents which have \n\n       already been placed on the record as per law, is hereby permitted. \n\n       This   case   is   fixed   for   final   arguments   on   6th  December,   2006   at \n\n       12.15 P.M. The case would be taken up on day to day basis.&quot;\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">Against the order passed by the High Court, the appellants have come to this \n\n\nCourt in these appeals.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">14.     Mr.   Lahoty   and   Mr.   Arvind   Kumar,   counsel   appearing   for   the \n\n\nappellants   in   the   three   appeals   placed   before   the   Court   passages   from   the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                             10</span>\n\n\n\nstatement   of   Vikram   recorded   in   Danapur   jail   on   September   30,   1978 \n\n\ndescribing the manner in which his earlier statements, incriminating himself \n\n\nand   the   other   accused,   were   obtained   by   the   CBI.   Referring   to   the   latter \n\n\nstatement of Vikram, counsel submitted that denial to further cross-examine \n\n\nhim   in   light   of   his   statement   of   September   30,   1978   would   cause   grave \n\n\nprejudice to the appellants and would lead to a miscarriage of justice. Mr. \n\n\nLahoty stated  that the accused in the L.N. Mishra  murder case  had earlier \n\n\ncome   to   this   court   for   quashing   the   trial   proceedings   and   their   appeal \n\n\n(Criminal Appeal No. 126 of 1987) was heard along with the case of Abdul \n\n\nRehman Antulay and was disposed of by a common  judgment reported  in \n\n\n(1992)   1   SCC   225.   In   paragraph   98   of  the   judgment,  the   Court   noted   the \n\n\nsubmission made on behalf of the appellants that a very unusual feature of \n\n\nthe case was the exchange of charges and counter charges between the CBI \n\n\nand the  Bihar (CID)  of false  implication  and frame  up against  each other. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">According to the Bihar (CID), the CBI was guilty of frame up against the \n\n\nmembers of Anand Marg, while according to CBI, the Bihar (CID) had been \n\n\ndeliberately   proceeding   against   innocent   persons   while   letting   of   the   real \n\n\nculprits.  Mr. Lahoty submitted that as a result of the Central  Investigating \n\n\nAgency and the State Investigating Agency acting at cross purpose, the case \n\n\nhad become highly murky to the great detriment of the appellants. He further \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                              11</span>\n\n\n\nsubmitted   that   in   that   situation   if   the   appellants   are   not   allowed   the \n\n\nopportunity to further cross-examine Vikram, the Approver (PW.1), it would \n\n\nbe highly unfair and unjust to them. He also submitted that the Delhi High \n\n\nCourt was wrong in rejecting the applications made by the appellants on the \n\n\nground of delay.       \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"105430\" id=\"span_10\">15.

The High Court does not say \n\n\nthat   the  appellants   were   in   anyway   responsible   for  the   inordinate   delay   in \n\n\ntheir appeals, that remains pending since 1976, being taken up for hearing. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">That being the position, as long as the appeals were pending, the High Court \n\n\nshould   have   considered   the   appellants&#x27;   request   for   summoning   PW.1   for \n\n\nfurther   cross-examination   on   merits,   and   in   light   of   the   relevant   legal \n\n\nprovisions.   Mr.   Lahoty   is   also   right   in   submitting   that   any   further   cross-\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">examination of PW.1 would not have taken more than two or three days and \n\n\nwould not have contributed to any further delay in the disposal of the appeal \n\n\nin any material way.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">19.

Mr. P.K.

He   was   then   produced \n\n\nbefore  the Chief Judicial  Magistrate on August  22, 1975 for recording his \n\n\nstatement   for   grant   of   pardon   under   <a href=\"/doc/122405/\" id=\"a_14\">Section   306</a>   Cr.P.C.   Finally,   he   was \n\n\nproduced before the trial court as PW.1 where he was examined first by the \n\n\nprosecution and was then subjected to a lengthy cross-examination on behalf \n\n\nof   the   accused.   On   none   of   the   three   occasions   he   made   the   slightest \n\n\ncomplaint   that   his   statements   were   obtained   under   coercion   or   threats.   He \n\n\nwas   also   produced   before   the   Magistrate   many   times   for   the   purpose   of \n\n\nremand and for other purposes, such as taking cognizance, commitment of \n\n\nthe case to the court of Sessions and also before the trial court where the trial \n\n\nproceeded and got concluded and at no point of time he gave any indication \n\n\nthat   his   statements/evidence   were   given   under   any   coercion,   threats   or \n\n\ninducement.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_30\">21.

Mr.   Dey   submitted   that   the   statement   made   by   Vikram   in   jail   on \n\n\nSeptember 30, 1978 could never be the basis for summoning him for further \n\n\ncross-examination   at   the   stage   of   the   appeal   and   in   support   of   this \n\n\nsubmission relied upon a decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1926510/\" id=\"a_16\">Mishrilal v. State of M.P.</a>,  \n\n\n(2005) 10 SCC 701. In that case, one of the prosecution witnesses (PW.2) \n\n\nhad   supported   the   prosecution   case   before   the   trial   court   but   before   the \n\n\nJuvenile Court that was trying some of the juvenile accused in the same case \n\n\nhe did not support the prosecution case and as a result, the juvenile accused \n\n\nwere   acquitted   of   the   charge   under   <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_17\">Section   307</a>   IPC   for   having   made   an \n\n\nattempt   on   the   life   of   this   witness.   After   his   evidence   before   the   Juvenile \n\n\nCourt,   he   was   again   summoned   before   the   trial   court   where   the   other \n\n\naccused were facing trial and was confronted with the evidence he had given \n\n\nbefore   the   Juvenile   Court.   This   Court   found   and   held   that   the   procedure \n\n\nadopted   by   the   Sessions   Judge   was   not   in   accordance   with   law   and   in \n\n\nparagraphs 5 and 6 of the judgment observed and held as follows:</span>\n</p>\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                       15</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">&quot;5. The learned Counsel for the appellants seriously attacked the \n\nevidence of PW.2 Mokam Singh. This witness was examined by \n\nthe Sessions Judge on 6-2-1991 and cross-examined on the same \n\nday by the defence counsel. Thereafter, it seems, that on behalf of \n\nthe   accused   persons   an   application   was   filed   and   PW.2   Mokam \n\nSingh   was   recalled.   PW.2   was   again   examined   and   cross-\n\nexamined on 31-7-1991. It may be noted that some of the persons \n\nwho were allegedly involved in this incident were minors and their \n\ncase was tried by the Juvenile Court. PW.2 Mokam Singh was also \n\nexamined as a witness in the case before the Juvenile Court. In the \n\nJuvenile   Court,   he   gave   evidence   to   the   effect   that   he   was   not \n\naware   of   the   persons   who   had   attacked   him   and   on   hearing   the \n\nvoice of the assailants, he assumed that they were some Banjaras. \n\nUpon   recalling,   PW.2   Mokam   Singh   was   confronted   with   the \n\nevidence he had given later before the Juvenile Court on the basis \n\nof which the accused persons were acquitted of the charge under \n\n<a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 307</a> IPC   for   having   made   an   attempt   on   the   life   of   this \n\nwitness.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">6.   In   our   opinion,   the   procedure   adopted   by   the   Sessions   Judge \n\nwas   not   strictly   in   accordance   with   law.   Once   the   witness   was \n\nexamined-in-chief and cross-examined fully, such witness should \n\nnot have been recalled  and re-examined  to deny the evidence  he \n\nhad already given before the court, even though that witness had \n\ngiven   an   inconsistent   statement   before   any   other   court   or   forum \n\nsubsequently. A witness could be confronted only with a previous \n\nstatement   made   by   him.   At   the   time   of   examination   of   PW.2 \n\nMokam Singh on 6.2.1991, there was no such previous statement \n\nand the defence counsel did not confront him with any statement \n\nalleged   to   have   been   made   previously.   This   witness   must   have \n\ngiven some other version before the Juvenile Court for extraneous \n\nreasons and he should not have been given a further opportunity at \n\na   later   stage   to   completely   efface   the   evidence   already   given   by \n\nhim under oath. The courts have to follow the procedures strictly \n\nand  cannot   allow   a  witness   to  escape   the   legal  action   for   giving \n\nfalse   evidence   before   the   court   on   mere   explanation   that   he   had \n\ngiven it under the pressure of the police or for some other reason. \n\nWhenever   the   witness   speaks   falsehood   in   the   court,   and   it   is \n\nproved satisfactorily, the court should take a serious action against \n\nsuch witnesses.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                              16</span>\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1757704\" id=\"span_19\">23.     The decision in  Mishrilal  was followed in  <a href=\"/doc/1757704/\" id=\"a_19\">Hanuman Ram  v.  State of  \n\n\nRajasthan and others</a>, (2008) 15 SCC 652.   The case of Mishrilal had come \n\n\nto   this   Court   after   the   appeal   court   had   maintained   the   conviction   and \n\n\nsentence   passed   against   the   accused.   But  Hanuman   Ram  came   at   the \n\n\nintermediate   stage   when   the  trial   court   was   directed   by   the   High   Court  to \n\n\nrecall   two   prosecution   witnesses   under   <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_20\">Section   311</a>   of   the   Cr.P.C.   under \n\n\nsimilar circumstances. In  Hanuman Ram  too, two of the witnesses (PWs 3 \n\n\nand 5) who had supported the prosecution case before the trial court did not \n\n\nsupport the case of the prosecution before the Children&#x27;s Court where one of \n\n\nthe accused  in the case who was a minor was being tried.  Before  the trial \n\n\ncourt   an   application   was   made   under   <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_21\">Section   311</a>   Cr.P.C.   for   summoning \n\n\nthose two witnesses for cross-examination with reference to their statements \n\n\nbefore   the   Children&#x27;s   Court.   The   trial   court   did   not   accept   the   prayer   and \n\n\nrejected   the   petition.   On   an   application   in   revision,   the   High   Court \n\n\nintervened in favour of the accused and directed the trial court to recall and \n\n\nre-examine the two witnesses. In appeal against the High Court order, this \n\n\nCourt following the earlier decision in Mishrilal, held that there was no legal \n\n\nfoundation   for   recalling   the   witnesses   under   <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_22\">Section   311</a>   Cr.P.C.   and   set \n\n\naside the High Court judgment.</span> \n</p>\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                             17</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">24.     At first sight, the decisions in  Mishrilal  and  Hanuman Ram  seem to \n\n\nclinch the issue arising in the case. But, on a deeper examination, it would \n\n\nappear  that the  decision  in  Mishrilal  did  not interpret   Section  311  Cr.P.C. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">defining the import, scope and ambit of the provision contained therein. It \n\n\nrather said that on the facts of the case, the provision had no application and \n\n\nthe procedure adopted by the trial court was not strictly in accordance with \n\n\nlaw. Now, the interpretation of a legal provision and its application to a set \n\n\nof   facts   are   two   different   exercises   requiring   different   approaches. \n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;Interpretation&quot;  means  the action of explaining the meaning of something. \n\n\nFor interpreting a statutory provision, the court is required to have an insight \n\n\ninto the provision and unfold its meaning by means of the well-established \n\n\ncanons of interpretation, having regard to the object, purpose, historicism of \n\n\nthe law and several other well-known factors. But, what is important to bear \n\n\nin mind is that the interpretation of a legal provision is always independent \n\n\nof   the   facts   of   any   given   case.   &quot;Application&quot;   means   the   practical   use   or \n\n\nrelevance   (of   something   to   something);   the   application   of   a   statutory \n\n\nprovision,   therefore,   is   by   definition   case   related   and   as   opposed   to \n\n\ninterpretation,   the   application   or   non-application   of   a   statutory   provision \n\n\nwould always depend on the exact facts of a given case. Anyone associated \n\n\nwith   the   process   of   adjudication   fully   knows   that   even   the   slightest \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                              18</span>\n\n\n\ndifference in the facts of two cases can make a world of difference on the \n\n\nquestion whether  or not a statutory provision can be fairly and reasonably \n\n\napplied   to   it.   Keeping   in   mind   what   is   said   here   if   we   read  Mishrilal,  it \n\n\nwould   be   evident   that   in   the   over   all   facts   of   that   case,   the   Court   was \n\n\nsatisfied that the statement of the witness (PW.2, Mokam Singh) before the \n\n\nJuvenile   Court   was  for   some   extraneous   reasons  and,   therefore,   he  should \n\n\nnot   have   been   allowed   an   opportunity   to   completely   efface   the   evidence \n\n\nalready given by him under oath. The Court with its vast experience of the \n\n\nway   criminal   justice   system   works   in   our   country   was   in   a   manner \n\n\ncommenting upon the serious and widespread malady of prosecution witness \n\n\nbeing   won   over   by   the   accused.   Once   the   Court   came   to   realise   that   the \n\n\nwitness was gained over before he was examined in the Juvenile Court, it \n\n\nnaturally felt that at least he should not have been allowed to spoil the other \n\n\ncase   too   and   it   would,   therefore,   logically   follow   that   his   recall   and   re-\n\n\nexamination in the trial of the other accused before the Sessions Court was \n\n\nan abuse of <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 311</a> of the Cr.P.C. To us, it appears that it was mainly \n\n\ndue to that reason that the Court frowned upon the latter evidence of PW.2 \n\n\ntaken   by   the   Sessions  Court  on  his  recall  after   his  examination  before   the \n\n\nJuvenile Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                              19</span>\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">25.    Moreover,   in  Mishrilal  the   question   that   came   up   for   consideration \n\n\nbefore the Court was whether the deposition of Mokam Singh (PW.2) before \n\n\nthe Juvenile Court would come within the meaning of &quot;previous statement&quot; \n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">under <a href=\"/doc/1110615/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act so as to justify his recall for further \n\n\ncross-examination   confronting  him  with  his  deposition   before  the  Juvenile \n\n\nCourt. The Court answered the question in the negative pointing out that at \n\n\nthe time of his examination earlier before the Sessions Court there was no \n\n\nsuch statement with which he could be confronted by the defence.  \n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">26.    In  Hanuman   Ram,   on   identical   facts   and   for   the   same   reasons   the \n\n\nCourt simply followed the decision in Mishrilal.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">27.    The   facts   of   the   case   before   us   are   quite   different.   It   is   not   only \n\n\nVikram   who   is   making   diametrically   opposite   statements   but   the  CBI   and \n\n\nthe State (CID) seem to be at loggerheads with the one accusing the other of \n\n\nmanipulating and using Vikram for its own designs. It is an unusual case by \n\n\nany reckoning. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">28.    It  is  obvious  that  one of the  two statements  of Vikram  is  false.  But \n\n\nunlike  Mishrilal  or  Hanuman   Ram  where   the   Court   was   able   to   sense \n\n\nwithout difficulty that the witnesses&#x27; depositions before the Juvenile Court \n\n\nand the Children&#x27;s Court respectively were false, it is very difficult to say at \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                               20</span>\n\n\n\nthis   stage   which   of  the   statements   is   true   and   which   of  the  statement   was \n\n\nmade   under   the   influence,   threat   or   coercion   by   the   State   officials   or   the \n\n\nCBI.   The   position   may   be   clear   in   case   he   is   subjected   to   further \n\n\nexamination   with   reference   to   his   statement   made   in   Danapur   jail   on \n\n\nSeptember 30, 1978.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">29.

Appellate Court may take further evidence or direct it \n\n       to be taken.- (1) In dealing with any appeal under this Chapter, \n\n       the   Appellate   Court,  if   it   thinks   additional   evidence   to   be \n\n       necessary,   shall   record   its   reasons   and   may   either   take   such \n\n       evidence itself, or direct it to be taken by a Magistrate, or, when \n\n       the Appellate Court is a High Court, by a Court of Session or a \n\n       Magistrate.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\n       (2) When the additional evidence is taken by the Court of Session \n\n       or   the   Magistrate,   it   or   he   shall   certify   such   evidence   to   the \n\n       Appellate   Court,   and   such   Court   shall   thereupon   proceed   to \n\n       dispose of the appeal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\n       (3) The accused or his pleader shall have the right to be present \n\n       when the additional evidence is taken.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\n       (4) The taking of evidence under this section shall be subject to \n\n       the provisions of Chapter XXIII, as if it were an inquiry. &quot;\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">30.     It   is,  thus,   to  be  seen   that   the   provision   is  not  limited   to  recall  of  a \n\n\nwitness   for   further   cross-examination   with   reference   to   his   previous \n\n\nstatement.   The   Appellate   Court   may   feel   the   necessity   to   take   additional \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                               21</span>\n\n\n\nevidence for any number of reasons to arrive at the just decision in the case. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">The law casts a duty upon the court to arrive at the truth by all lawful means. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">This is another reason why we feel any reliance on Mishrilal that considered \n\n\nthe recall of a witness in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1110615/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act is \n\n\nquite misplaced in the facts of this case.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">31.     Mr. Dey contended that Vikram&#x27;s statement that he is alleged to have \n\n\nmade in jail has no legal sanctity and it came to be made and recorded in a \n\n\nmanner   completely   unknown   to   law.   Mr   Dey   may   be   right   but   on   that \n\n\nground alone it would not be correct and proper to deny the application of \n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/782148/\" id=\"a_27\">Section   391</a>   of   the   Cr.P.C.   Take   the   case   where,   on   the   testimony   of   the \n\n\nApprover,   a   person   is   convicted   by   the   trial   court   under   Section   302   and \n\n\n120-B   etc.   of   the   Penal   Code   and   is   sentenced   to   a   life   term.     After   the \n\n\njudgment and order passed by the trial court and while the convict&#x27;s appeal \n\n\nis  pending  before  the High  Court, the  `Approver&#x27;  is  found  blabbering  and \n\n\nboasting among his friends that he was able to take the Court for a ride and \n\n\nsettled  his personal  score with the convict by sending  him to jail to rot  at \n\n\nleast  for 14 years.  Such  a statement  would also  be completely beyond the \n\n\nlegal framework but can it be said that in light of such a development the \n\n\nconvicted accused may not ask the High Court for recalling the Approver for \n\n\nfurther examination.\n</p>\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                             22</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">32.     As a matter of fact, if some later statement, has come to be made in \n\n\nsome   legal   ways,   it   may   be   admissible   on   its   own   without   any   help   from \n\n\nSection   311   or   <a href=\"/doc/782148/\" id=\"a_28\">Section   391</a>   of   the   Cr.P.C.   It   is   only   such   statement   or \n\n\ndevelopment which is otherwise not within the legal framework that would \n\n\nneed the exercise of the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction to bring it before it as part of the \n\n\nlegal record.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">33.     In   light   of   the   discussions   made   above,   we   have   no   hesitation   in \n\n\nholding that the High Court was in error in refusing to summon Vikram, the \n\n\nApprover (PW.1) for his further examination as prayed for on behalf of the \n\n\nappellants.  We, accordingly, set aside that part of the High Court order and \n\n\ndirect the High Court to summon Vikram (PW.1) for his further examination \n\n\nby the appellants and if so desired by the CBI.  For the sake of convenience, \n\n\nthe   High   Court   may   direct   a   member   of   the   Registry   of   the   rank   of   a \n\n\nSessions Judge/Additional Sessions Judge to record the additional evidence \n\n\nof Vikram (PW.1).  The examination of the witness by the appellants and the \n\n\nCBI must not go beyond two working days each so that the recording of his \n\n\nevidence   should   be   complete   in   not   more   than   four   days.   The   Registrar \n\n\nrecording the evidence would certify it and place before the Court and the \n\n\nCourt shall then proceed to dispose of the appeals.\n</p>\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                                23</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">34.     The appeals are thus allowed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">35.     Before parting with the record of the case we are constrained to say \n\n\nthat   we   are   distressed   beyond   words   to   find   that   the   case   relating   to   the \n\n\nattempt on the life of the CJI remains stuck up at the stage of the appeal even \n\n\nafter about 37 years of the occurrence. We are informed that the other case \n\n\nof the killing of Shri L.N. Mishra is still mired before the trial court. We do \n\n\nnot wish to make any comment on that case as that is the subject matter of \n\n\nWrit   Petition   (Criminal)   Nos.   200   and   203   of   2011   that   remains   pending \n\n\nbefore   this   Court.   But   so   far   as   the   present   case   is   concerned,   we   would \n\n\nrequest the Chief Justice of the Delhi High Court with all the strength at our \n\n\ncommand   to   take   notice   of   the   inordinately   long   time   for   which   these \n\n\nappeals (Criminal Appeal Nos.436 &amp; 443 of 1996) are pending before the \n\n\nHigh   Court   and   to   put   a   tab   on   them  so   as   to   ensure   that   the   appeals   are \n\n\ndisposed   of   without   any   further   delay   and   in   any   case   not   later   than   six \n\n\nmonths from the date of the receipt/production of a copy of this order. </p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n\n\n\n\n\n                                                            ...................................J.\n\n                                                            (Aftab Alam)\n\n\n\n\n                                                            ...................................J.\n\nNew Delhi,                                                       (Ranjana Prakash Desai)\n\nJanuary 19, 2012.\n\n\f\n</pre>","numcites":16,"numcitedby":91,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":135573998,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"criminal procedure code section 311","formInput":"criminal%20procedure%20code%20section%20311"},{"value":"murder case","formInput":"murder%20case"},{"value":"section 311 crpc","formInput":"section%20311%20crpc"},{"value":"section 311 cr.p.c","formInput":"section%20311%20cr.p.c"},{"value":"best bakery case","formInput":"best%20bakery%20case"},{"value":"coercion","formInput":"coercion"},{"value":"l n mishra murder","formInput":"l%20n%20mishra%20murder"},{"value":"crpc 311","formInput":"crpc%20311"},{"value":"section 311 of cr.pc","formInput":"section%20311%20of%20cr.pc"},{"value":"transfer petition","formInput":"transfer%20petition"},{"value":"additional evidence","formInput":"additional%20evidence"},{"value":"\"best bakery case\"","formInput":"%22best%20bakery%20case%22"},{"value":"previous statement","formInput":"previous%20statement"},{"value":"311 cr.p.c.","formInput":"311%20cr.p.c."},{"value":"criminal miscellaneous application","formInput":"criminal%20miscellaneous%20application"},{"value":"section 311 ","formInput":"section%20311%20"},{"value":"best bakery ","formInput":"best%20bakery%20"},{"value":"juvenile","formInput":"juvenile"},{"value":"section 307","formInput":"section%20307"},{"value":"threat","formInput":"threat"}],"cats":[{"value":"power-to-summon-any-person-as-witness","formInput":"tag:power-to-summon-any-person-as-witness"},{"value":"cross-examining-of-written-statements","formInput":"tag:cross-examining-of-written-statements"},{"value":"attempt-to-murder","formInput":"tag:attempt-to-murder"},{"value":"law-governing-evidence","formInput":"tag:law-governing-evidence"},{"value":"confession-recording, recording-of-statement","formInput":"tag:confession-recording, recording-of-statement"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
