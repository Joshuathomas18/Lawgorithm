Being aggrieved by the aforesaid impugned\n  judgment of conviction and order of sentence, the appellants have\n                                       Pr\n  filed this appeal challenging the findings of the learned trial\n                                 a\n  court on the ground that all the witnesses are partisaned as it is\n                               hy\n\n  admitted fact that they had strained relationship on account of\n                          ad\n\n\n\n  criminal litigation and political rivalry with regard to election of\n  Sarpanch. Their statements are full of material contradictions and\n                   M\n\n\n\n\n  omissions. The incident had taken place in the dark night. The\n                of\n\n\n\n\n  evidence with regard to having torch by Bhimsen (PW-1) at the\n  time of incident is not reliable as the alleged torch has not been\n           rt\n\n\n\n\n  seized. The FIR is also antedated. At the time of incident,\n       ou\n\n\n\n\n  appellant Ã¢ÂÂ accused Narendra was busy doing his job as\n   C\n\n\n\n\n  medical practitioner and appellant Ã¢ÂÂ accused Ramsuhavan\n h\n\n\n\n\n  was ill and admitted in the hospital at Raipur. So far as other\n ig\n\n\n\n\n  accused persons are concerned, they have been also implicated in\nH\n\n\n\n\n  the incident on account of rivalry because if they had been\n  present at the time of incident they would have also assaulted\n  somebody by their weapons. Their overt act has not been proved.\n  Hence, it cannot be said that they were the member of an\n  unlawful assembly. The evidence with regard to recovery of gun\n  from the possession of appellant / accused Narendra S/o. Ganesh\n  Singh is also not reliable. The gun was not recovered from the\n  possession of accused / appellant Narendra. It was recovered\n  from an agriculture field which was an open place and the seized\n   gun is a licensee gun of Chhangeshwar Singh (DW-10) who has\n  stated that the gun was taken by the Investigating Officer\n  Khurshid Khan (PW-11) on 13.3.1996 with cartridge under the\n\n\n\n\n                                                    sh\n  pretext of investigation and the same was not returned to him. In\n\n\n\n\n                                               e\n  the aforesaid circumstances, the prosecution has failed to\n\n\n\n\n                                            ad\n  establish the charges against the appellants. Hence, in the view\n  of the facts and circumstances of the case, prayer is made to\n                                         Pr\n  allow the appeal and set-aside the impugned judgment of\n                                 a\n  conviction and order of sentence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">                               hy\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">  9.

Having considered the rival contentions of both the\n  parties and on perusal of the record         it is found that in this\n           rt\n\n\n\n\n  case there is no controversy that the deceased Arunandra had\n        ou\n\n\n\n\n  died on 13.3.1996 in the intervening night of 13/14.3.1996 in\n   C\n\n\n\n\n  village Kushwar near a garden situated on the way the house of\n h\n\n\n\n\n  Ramniranjan Singh and Babulal on account of gunshot injury\n ig\n\n\n\n\n  caused by accused Narendra S/o. Ganesh Singh and at the same\nH\n\n\n\n\n  time, Babulal (PW-5) also received gunshot injury.

Section 149 of the Penal Code\n           of\n\n\n\n\n       provides that if an offence is committed\n       rt\n\n\n\n\n       by any member of an unlawful assembly\n      ou\n\n\n\n\n       in prosecution of the common object of\n       that assembly, or such as the members of\n  C\n\n\n\n\n       that assembly knew to be likely to be\n h\n\n\n\n\n       committed in prosecution of that object,\n ig\n\n\n\n\n       every person who at the time of the\nH\n\n\n\n\n       committing of that offence, is a member\n       of the same assembly is guilty of that\n       offence. The two clauses of Section 149\n       vary in degree of certainty. The first\n       clause contemplates the commission of an\n       offence by any member of an unlawful\n       assembly which can be held to have been\n       committed in prosecution of the common\n       object of the assembly. The second clause\n        embraces within its fold the commission\n       of an act which may not necessarily be\n       the common object of the assembly,\n\n\n\n\n                                             sh\n       nevertheless, the members of the\n\n\n\n\n                                         e\n       assembly had knowledge of likelihood of\n\n\n\n\n                                      ad\n       the commission of that offence in\n       prosecution of the common object.

In either case,\n           of\n\n\n\n\n       every member of the assembly would be\n       vicariously liable for the offence actually\n       rt\n\n\n\n\n       committed by any other member of the\n      ou\n\n\n\n\n       assembly. A mere possibility of the\n  C\n\n\n\n\n       commission of the offence would not\n h\n\n\n\n\n       necessarily enable the court to draw an\n ig\n\n\n\n\n       inference that the likelihood of\nH\n\n\n\n\n       commission of such offence was within\n       the knowledge of every member of the\n       unlawful assembly. It is difficult indeed,\n       though not impossible, to collect direct\n       evidence of such knowledge. An inference\n       may be drawn from circumstances such\n       as the background of the incident, the\n       motive, the nature of the assembly, the\n       nature of the arms carried by the\n        members of the assembly, their common\n       object and the behaviour of the members\n       soon before, at or after the actual\n\n\n\n\n                                              sh\n       commission of the crime.
