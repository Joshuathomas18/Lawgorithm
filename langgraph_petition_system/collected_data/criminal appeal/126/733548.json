Before   we   proceed \n\n\n  further to discuss and consider the submissions made by \n\n\n  learned   counsel   appearing   on   behalf   of   their   respective \n\n\n  parties, it is just and necessary to notice that Akhlaq (A 1) \n\n\n  who   is   stated   to   be   the   main   culprit,   did   not   prefer   any \n\n\n  appeal   against   his   conviction   and   sentence   of   life \n\n\n  imprisonment granted by the High Court.

It is they who speak about \n\n\n  incriminating   circumstances   and   the   chain   of   events. \n\n\n  There is no dispute whatsoever that the prosecution  has \n\n\n  clearly established that the murder of deceased Sujaullah \n\n\n  @ Mintu took place in the room located on the first floor \n\n\n  of a shop which was under the occupation of Akhlaq (A 1) \n\n\n  and   others.   The   pieces   of   dead   body   of   the   deceased \n\n\n  Sujaullah @ Mintu were recovered from that room. This is \n\n\n  one   of   the   strong   circumstances   suggesting   the \n\n\n  involvement   of   Akhlaq   in   the   crime.

Her \n\n\n  evidence   receives   complete   corroboration   from   the \n\n\n  statement   of   PW   1   that   he   was   informed   by   Smt.   Zebi \n\n\n  (PW   3)   that   the   deceased   left   home   on   receiving \n\n\n  telephone call from the accused Akhlaq but did not return \n\n\n  thereafter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">16.

The evidence of PW 3 read together \n\n\n  with that of PW1&#x27;s statement, unerringly establishes that \n\n\n  the   deceased   had   gone   to   the   shop   belonging   to   the \n\n\n  accused Akhlaq on receiving a telephone call from Akhlaq \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                                       19</span>\n\n\n\n   in connection with the payment that was due to him from \n\n\n   Akhlaq and others.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">17. There   is   nothing   to   disbelieve   the   evidence   of   Sheikh \n\n\n\n   Zakaullah (PW 1) that till midnight he could not trace the \n\n\n   deceased and out of desperation he returned to his work \n\n\n   place   and   by   midnight   he   noticed   the   accused   Akhlaq, \n\n\n   Imtiaz and Wakkar along with two other persons coming \n\n\n   down from the stairs of the first floor room of the shop of \n\n\n   Akhlaq where the dead body was later on found. It is in \n\n\n   his   evidence   that   he   enquired   from   Akhlaq   about   his \n\n\n   brother and Akhlaq gave an evasive answer. There is no \n\n\n   dispute whatsoever that the murder of the deceased took \n\n\n   place during that night only at the shop belonging to the \n\n\n   accused   where   all   the   three   accused   Akhlaq,   Imtiaz   and \n\n\n   Wakkar were seen coming from the scene of offence. It is \n\n\n   undoubtedly a very strong circumstance which unerringly \n\n\n   points   towards   the   culpability   and   involvement   of   these \n\n\n   three accused.

It   is   also   crucial   to   note   that \n\n\nupon   suspicion,   PW   1   insisted   Akhlaq   to   show   the   first \n\n\nfloor   room   of   his   shop   but   there   was   no   response \n\n\nwhatsoever   as   the   accused   just   avoided   stating   that   he \n\n\nwas not in possession of the key of the locked room and \n\n\nat   that   point   of   time,   the   accused   Akhlaq   was   very \n\n\nnervous. It is at that time, PW 1 became suspicious about \n\n\nthe whole thing and in the process, PW 1 with the help of \n\n\na ladder, climbed to the roof of the said first floor room of \n\n\nthe shop from behind and on reaching the roof got down \n\n\nthrough the stairs of the first floor and noticed scattered \n\n\nblood   on  the  floor  and   found  pieces   of  dead  body  of  his \n\n\nbrother.   The   trial   Court   and   as   well   as   the   High   Court \n\n\nhave   properly   appreciated   the   evidence   of   PW   1   in   this \n\n\nregard and there is nothing on record to disagree with the \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                           21</span>\n\n\n\n  view taken by the Courts below.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">18. PW 6 is one Sompal who heard the human shrieks coming \n\n\n\n  out from the first floor room of the shop belonging to the \n\n\n  accused Akhlaq. This witness has a furniture shop in the \n\n\n  neighbourhood of the shop of Akhlaq. It is in his evidence \n\n\n  that  he told  Zakaullah  (PW 1)  that  in the previous  night \n\n\n  he had heard human shrieks coming out of the first floor \n\n\n  room of the shop. This witness was not subjected to any \n\n\n  cross examination except by the counsel representing the \n\n\n  accused Akhlaq. We cannot disbelieve the presence of this \n\n\n  witness   in   his   own   shop   at   about   9   p.m.   on   the   fateful \n\n\n  night. It is in his evidence that on that fateful night of the \n\n\n  incident,   there   was   some   `pooja&#x27;   in   the   vicinity   and \n\n\n  therefore,   he   stayed   back   to   have   some  prasad  after \n\n\n  pooja.  His presence at that time in the neighbourhood of \n\n\n  the   place   of   incident   cannot   be   doubted.   No   particular \n\n\n  reason   suggested   to   him   in   the   cross   examination   as   to \n\n\n  why he should give a false statement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                                       22</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">19. The   last   one   of   the   foremost   circumstances   which   is \n\n\n\n  brought on record through the evidence of the witnesses \n\n\n  examined   on   behalf   of   the   prosecution   relates   to   the \n\n\n  recoveries of incriminating articles made from the accused \n\n\n  Akhlaq,   Wakkar   and   Imtiaz.   It   is   on   record   that   blood \n\n\n  stained   knives   and   daggers   allegedly   used   in   the   crime \n\n\n  and   the   blood   stained   scooter,   trouser   and   watch \n\n\n  belonging   to   the   deceased   were   recovered   and   these \n\n\n  articles   have   contained   human   blood   stains   on   them. \n\n\n  These   articles   are   said   to   have   been   recovered   on   the \n\n\n  disclosure   made   by   the   appellants   to   the   police.   There \n\n\n  was   some   criticism   that   there   were   no   independent \n\n\n  witnesses   to   the   recovery   except   PW   1   and   the \n\n\n  Investigating   Officer,   R.P.   Sharma,   PW   14.   But,   we   are \n\n\n  not   inclined   to   reject   the   evidence   of   PW   1   merely \n\n\n  because he happened to be the brother of the deceased. \n\n\n  It is true that recovery of certain incriminating articles at \n\n\n  the   instance   of   the   accused   under   <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_36\">Section   27</a>   of   the \n\n\n  Evidence Act by itself cannot form the basis of conviction. \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                                        23</span>\n\n\n\n  The   recovery   of  incriminating  articles   and   its   evidentiary \n\n\n  value  has  to be considered  in  the light of other  relevant \n\n\n  circumstances as well and the chain of events suggesting \n\n\n  the   involvement   of   the   accused.   The   trial   Court   and   as \n\n\n  well as the appellate Court did not rest the conviction of \n\n\n  the   appellants   solely   based   on   the   recoveries.   The   fact \n\n\n  remains   that   the   recovery   of   articles   used   in   the \n\n\n  commission of offence has been taken into consideration \n\n\n  together   with   other   incriminating   circumstances   brought \n\n\n  on record by the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_46\">20.Now the only question that remains for our consideration \n\n\n  is whether the case on hand is one of over implication?\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_47\">21. Learned   senior   counsel   for   the   appellants   strenuously \n\n\n\n  contended that there is no evidence available on record to \n\n\n  show   the   involvement   of   these   appellants   in   the   crime. \n\n\n  The   submission   was   that   no   motive   has   been   suggested \n\n\n  as against these appellants as to why they should commit \n\n\n  the murder of the deceased. We shall consider the same.\n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                             24</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">22. It   is   in   the   evidence   of   PW   1   that   the   accused   Nanha \n\n\n\n   Pahalwan, Salman and Imtiaz are real brothers. Wakkar is \n\n\n   none other than the son of their step brother Irshad.  The \n\n\n   evidence   available   on   record   shows   that   the   deceased \n\n\n   Sujaullah   invested   a   sum   of   Rs.60,000/-   in   the \n\n\n   lottery/money circulation scheme which was being run by \n\n\n   these   persons   along   with   Akhlaq.   The   deceased   was \n\n\n   repeatedly   demanding   for   return   of   his   amount   from   all \n\n\n   the accused.  In the  circumstances  it becomes difficult to \n\n\n   accept the submission of learned senior counsel that the \n\n\n   appellants Wakkar and Imtiaz were in no way involved in \n\n\n   the   conduct   of   business   of   lottery/money   circulation \n\n\n   scheme   along   with   the   accused   Akhlaq   at   the   shop \n\n\n   belonging to Akhlaq.   For the aforesaid reasons, we hold \n\n\n   that   the   trial   Court   and   as   well   as   the   High   Court   have \n\n\n   rightly concluded that the immediate impelling motive on \n\n\n   the part of the appellants which led them to commit the \n\n\n   crime in question is traceable to their involvement in the \n\n\n   business   and   persistent   demands   from   the   deceased   for \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                                          25</span>\n\n\n\n   return   of   his   money.   We   are   not   inclined   to   accept   the \n\n\n   submission made by the learned senior counsel that there \n\n\n   is   no   evidence   suggesting   that   the   appellants   were   also \n\n\n   involved   in   the   said   finance   business   along   with   Akhlaq. \n\n\n   Like Akhlaq, the appellants also had the impelling motive \n\n\n   which led them to commit the crime in question. It is not \n\n\n   a   case   of   any   over   implication.   In   this   context,   the \n\n\n   evidence   of   PW1   becomes   relevant   that   he   noticed   the \n\n\n   accused Akhlaq, Imtiaz and Wakkar along with two other \n\n\n   persons   coming   down   from   the   stairs   of   the   first   floor \n\n\n   room   of   Akhlaq&#x27;s   shop   where   the   dead   body   of   the \n\n\n   deceased was later on found. The findings recorded by the \n\n\n   trial   Court   and   confirmed   in   appeal   by   the   High   Court \n\n\n   finding the appellants to be guilty of the charged offences \n\n\n   along with Akhlaq are unassailable. Both these appellants \n\n\n   have been rightly convicted for the offences so charged.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">23. What   remains   for   our   consideration   is   whether   the   High \n\n\n\n   Court   committed   any   error   in   acquitting   the   accused \n\n\n   persons   Salman   and   Nanha   Pahalwan.   They   were \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                                                        26</span>\n\n\n\nconvicted only for the offence of illegal possession of the \n\n\nillicit   arms   punishable   under   <a href=\"/doc/1487298/\" id=\"a_37\">Section   25(4)</a>   of   the   Arms \n\n\nAct. The High Court rightly refused to convict them based \n\n\nonly  on   the   recovery   of   incriminating   material   objects. \n\n\nThe   High   Court   has   noted   that   their   names   did   not   find \n\n\nplace   in   the  FIR  (Ext.     Ka-1)   initially  given   at  the  police \n\n\nstation   by   PW   1   which   consists   of   the   names   of   three \n\n\naccused   persons   Akhlaq,   Wakkar   and   Imtiaz   and   two \n\n\nmore   persons   whom   PW   1  was   not   able   to   identify.   The \n\n\nnames of Nanha Pahalawan and Salman have figured on \n\n\nsubsequent   information   received   by   PW   1.   The \n\n\ncircumstance pressed into service that the deceased was \n\n\nlast seen in the company of the accused including Nanha \n\n\nPahalwan and Salman has been rightly disbelieved by the \n\n\nHigh Court. The statement of Irfan `panwala&#x27; which is the \n\n\nroot suggesting that the deceased was last seen with the \n\n\naccused   including   Nanha   Pahalwan   and   Salman   is   of   no \n\n\nconsequence   since   he   has   not   been   examined   as   a \n\n\nwitness   by   the   prosecution.   Thus,   there   is   no   evidence \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                                               27</span>\n\n\n\n   whatsoever to connect Nanha Pahalwan and Salman with \n\n\n   the   commission   of   the   crime.   The   High   Court,   in   our \n\n\n   considered   opinion,   rightly   acquitted   both   the   said \n\n\n   accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">24. Whether   the   case   falls   in   the   category   of   `rarest   of   rare&#x27; \n\n\n\n   for awarding death sentence? There is no direct evidence \n\n\n   as   to   the   manner   in   which   the   gruesome   murder   had \n\n\n   taken place. It is not possible to discern and arrive at any \n\n\n   definite   conclusion   as   to   the   role   played   by   each   of   the \n\n\n   accused   in   the   commission   of   the   dastardly   crime.   No \n\n\n   doubt   they   committed   the   crime   in   cold   blood   but   did   it \n\n\n   quite stealthly. The entire case rests on the circumstantial \n\n\n   evidence. The High Court having taken all relevant factors \n\n\n   into consideration rightly came to the conclusion that the \n\n\n   case is not the one which falls in the category of `rarest of \n\n\n   rare&#x27;. We are in agreement with the conclusion arrived at \n\n\n   by   the   High   Court   and   its   decision   to   award   life \n\n\n   imprisonment alone and not the death sentence.\n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                                             28</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">25.For all the aforesaid reasons, we confirm the judgment of \n\n\n  the High Court and accordingly dismiss all the appeals.\n\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">                         ..............................................J.\n\n                         (B.
