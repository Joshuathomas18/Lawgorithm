It is not enough that harassment or cruelty\n              was caused to the woman with a demand for\n              dowry at some time, if Section 304B is to be\n              invoked. But it should have happened &quot;soon\n              before her death&quot;. The said phrase, no doubt, is\n              an elastic expression and can refer to a period\n              either immediately before her death or within a\n              few days or even a few weeks before it. But the\n              proximity to her death is the pivot indicated by\n              that expression. The legislative object in\n              providing such a radius of time by employing the\n              words &quot;soon before her death&quot; is to emphasis\n              the idea that her death should, in all\n              probabilities, have been the aftermath of such\n              cruelty or harassment. In other words, there\n              should be a perceptible nexus between her\n              death and the dowry related harassment or\n              cruelty inflicted on her. If the interval elapsed\n              between the infliction of such harassment or\n              cruelty and her death is wide the court would be\n              in a position to gauge that in all probabilities the\n              death would not have been the immediate cause\n              of her death. It is hence for the court to decide,\n              on the facts and circumstances of each case,\n              whether the said interval in that particular case\n              was sufficient to snuff its cord from the concept\n              &quot;soon before her death&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"366871\" id=\"span_9\">{See also <a href=\"/doc/366871/\" id=\"a_18\">Harjit Singh vs. State of Punjab</a> [(2006) 1 SCC\n        463]}</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">        25. Indisputably, in order to attract the said provision, it is\n        imperative on the part of the prosecution to establish that\n        the cruelty or harassment has been meted out to the\n        deceased `soon before her death&#x27;. There cannot be any\n        doubt or dispute that it is a flexible term. Its application\n        would depend upon the factual matrix obtaining in a\n        particular case. No fix period can be indicated therefor. It,\n        however, must undergo the test known as `proximity test&#x27;.\n        What, however, is necessary for the prosecution is to bring\n        on record that the dowry demand was not too late and not\n        too stale before the death of the victim.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"104632193\" id=\"span_10\">20.

We first take up the argument relating to Section 304B\n       and the presumption drawn under Section 113B. A bare\n       reading of Section 304B pre- supposes several factors for\n       its applicability, they being:- (i) death should be of burns or\n       bodily injury or has occurred otherwise than under normal\n       circumstances:(ii) within seven years of the marriage; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">       (iii) that soon before her death she had been subjected to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                    7                       Cr.A.

We find in the present case that there is no evidence of\n       unnatural death. It is the prosecution story that the\n       deceased had been poisoned. It has, however, come in\n       the evidence, and in particular, in the report of the Forensic\n       Science Laboratory dated 21st August, 1995, that on an\n       analysis of the bones and ashes no poisonous substance\n       had been found to be present. In this view of the matter,\n       the mere fact that the deceased happened to be a young\n       woman would not lead to the inference that she had died\n       an unnatural death. Likewise, we find that the evidence of\n       demand for dowry or goods soon before death is also\n       lacking. Admittedly, the only evidence of any demand was\n       of Rs. 25,000/- made one year prior to the incident and as\n       per the defence evidence of D.W. 2 and D.W. 4, the\n       money for the execution of the sale deed had been taken\n       out from the bank a day earlier.

There\n             cannot be any doubt or dispute that it is a flexible\n             term. Its application would depend upon the factual\n             matrix obtaining in a particular case. No fixed period\n             can be indicated therefor. It, however, must undergo\n             the test known as &#x27;the proximity test&#x27;. What, however,\n             is necessary for the prosecution is to bring on record\n             that the dowry demand was not too late and not too\n             stale before the death of the victim.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">       We, therefore, find that evidence clearly fails the proximity\n       test as <a href=\"/doc/258994/\" id=\"a_22\">laid down in</a> the aforesaid judgment.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">21.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1521945\" id=\"span_13\">In <a href=\"/doc/1521945/\" id=\"a_23\">Satvir Singh and others v.

But the latter is made a more\n       serious offence by providing a much higher sentence and\n       also by imposing a minimum period of imprisonment as the\n       sentence. In other words, if death occurs otherwise than\n       under normal circumstances within 7 years of the marriage\n       as a sequel to the cruelty or harassment inflicted on a\n       woman with demand of dowry, soon before her death,\n       Parliament intended such a case to be treated as a very\n       serious offence punishable even upto imprisonment for life\n       in appropriate cases.

He further submitted that learned trial\n\nCourt did not appreciate the evidence properly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_33\">24.   Learned trial Court after appreciation of the evidence, found that\n\nprosecution has failed to adduce evidence with regard to harassment given\n\nto the deceased. Learned trial Court in para 21 of the judgment observed\n\nthat not a single witness stated about the harassment and cruel treatment\n\ngiven to the deceased. Kalicharan (PW-1) in para 3 of his deposition has\n\nstated that he has no personal knowledge as to how Manjesh Kumari died.\n\nThe evidence of this witness is hearsay evidence. Pannalal (PW-2) and\n\nHarkanth (PW-11) stated in their statements that accused Vidyadevi did not\n\nlive in house at Kheria before the death of Manjesh Kumari and had gone to\n\nher parents house due to death of her mother. These witness also did not\n\nstate in their statements about the presence of accused Vidyadevi at the\n\ntime of incident at village Kheriyator. Harkanth (PW-11) in his statement\n\ndenied the demand of bike by Vidyadevi. These witnesses specifically\n\nstated in previous statement dated 5.5.99 in para 14 that in village\n\nKheriyator only Ashok Kumar, husband of the deceased, and deceased\n\nManjesh Kumari were residing. The trial Court also found that Vidyadevi was\n\nnot living with Ashok and Manjesh Kumari and even she was not present in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                     10                        Cr.A.

Trial\n\nCourt also found and held in para 33 of the judgment that Kamlabai (PW-6)\n\nadmitted in previous statement dated 12.7.99 that after marriage till two\n\nyears Manjesh Kumari was living with comfort. The trial Court also did not\n\nfind the statement of this witness reliable.

In view of the above statements and observation made by learned\n\ntrial Court, learned trial Court has rightly appreciated the evidence and come\n\nto the conclusion that there is no cogent evidence on record against the\n\nappellants/accused that &quot;soon before her death&quot; there was any demand of\n\ndowry or that any of them harassed or meted out cruelty to the deceased for\n\nor in connection with any such demand. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1532476\" id=\"span_23\">In this regard, in <a href=\"/doc/1532476/\" id=\"a_39\">Keshab Chandra\n\nPanda v.

Thereafter she committed\n        suicide by self-immolation.

It was observed in that context that\n        above rule of evidence was prescribed in law to obviate\n        the difficulty of the prosecution to further prove that the\n        offence was perpetrated by the husband or her relatives,\n        as then it would be the burden of the accused to rebut the\n        presumption. As a result, the accused <a href=\"/doc/134512257/\" id=\"a_46\">in that case</a> was\n        acquitted of the charge under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 304-B</a> of IPC.,\n        though he was convicted under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 498-A</a> of IPC.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"258994\" id=\"span_28\">See also <a href=\"/doc/258994/\" id=\"a_49\">Suresh Kumar Singh, Gurdeep Singh and Satvir Singh</a> (supra)</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">31.   Therefore,    there    is   no    cogent       evidence      against   the\n\nappellants/accused that they subjected the deceased to cruelty or\n\nharassment for demand of dowry soon before her death. Hence,\n\naccused/appellants cannot be held guilty for the offence of causing dowry\n\ndeath of deceased Manjesh, and therefore, learned trial Court has rightly\n\nacquitted the appellants/accused of the charge under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 304-B</a> of IPC\n\nand the judgment of acquittal cannot be set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">32.

Body of the deceased was found in the house of appellant/accused\n\nAshok, husband of the deceased, but only on this count, they cannot be\n\nheld guilty for causing death of the deceased, hence, it would be proper to\n\nsee whether at the time of death appellants/accused were present in the\n\nhouse or not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_46\">35.   On the aforesaid aspect, appellants/accused examined Ramswaroop\n\n(DW-1) and Hargovind (DW-2). Hargovind (DW-2) stated in his deposition\n\nthat from 17.11.1998 he had called appellant-Ashok to village Ruariya police\n\nStation Ambah Distt. Morena and Ramswaroop (DW-1) stated in his\n\ndeposition that on receiving the information about the death of his wife,\n\nappellant-Shambhudayal had come to Bhawanipur and stayed there on 27th\n\nand 28th. Statements of both the defence witnesses have been supported by\n\nHarkanth (PW-2), uncle of deceased&#x27;s father Mahavir Prasad, in para 13 of\n\nhis statement as well as by Pannalal (PW-1) and they have not been\n\ndeclared hostile. Therefore, from the statements of the defence witnesses\n\nwhich is also supported by the prosecution witnesses, it is proved that at the\n\ntime of death of deceased Manjesh Kumari appellants/accused were not\n\npresent in the house. However, it was the duty of the prosecution to prove\n\nthat appellants/accused were present, at the time of death of the deceased,\n\nin the house, but prosecution failed to prove the same. In the\n\ncircumstances, merely because the dead-body of the deceased was found\n\nin the house of appellants/accused itself is not a sufficient ground to convict\n\nthe appellants for an offence punishable under Section 302 for causing the\n\ndeath of the deceased, therefore, learned trial Court has rightly acquitted the\n\nappellants/accused of this charge. Hence, Criminal Appeal No.300/00 fails\n\nand is hereby dismissed.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                              15                             Cr.A.

Now, we would consider the factual aspect of Criminal Appeal\n\nNo.13/2000 by which conviction and sentence of the appellants/accused\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 498-A</a> of IPC has been challenged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">37.     Learned trial Court has discussed the evidence of Kamla (PW-5),\n\nmother of the deceased, in para 30 of its judgment in which learned trial\n\nCourt has observed that Kamla (PW-5) in her statement stated that after two\n\nyears of marriage of her daughter Mangesh, appellants/accused used to\n\nbeat and harass her for not meeting the demand of motorcycle in dowry,\n\nthen she took her to Jhabua. Appellant Ashok Kumar also came to Jhabua\n\nand raised the demand for motorcycle, then she gave Rs.10,000/- to him\n\nwith an assurance that she will give the motorcycle later on. She further\n\nstated that after some time appellants/accused again used to beat\n\ndeceased Mangesh, then she took her to her village and keep her for 5-6\n\nmonths. Statement of Kamla (PW-5) is supported by Harikanth (PW-2),\n\nBeniram (PW-3), Munnalal (PW-6), Munnalal son of Gopilal (PW-7),\n\nMahavir Prasad (PW-9), Mohar Singh (PW-11) and Kalyan Singh (PW-12).\n\nAlthough all the witnesses are relatives of the deceased, but only on this\n\ncount, their evidence cannot be discarded and disbelieved.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">38.

Therefore, after minute scrutiny of the statement of Kamla (PW-5),\n\nmother of the deceased, which is also supported by the other prosecution\n\nwitnesses, it is found that there is sufficient material available on the record\n\nto prove the demand of motorcycle in dowry. Hence, learned trial Court has\n\nrightly convicted the appellants/accused under Section 498-A of the Code of\n\n1860.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">40.     Corollary of the aforesaid finding is that appellants/accused cannot be\n\nconvicted for the offence under Section 304-B of the Code of 1860, but this\n\nwould not save them under Section 498-A of the Code of 1860 for which\n\nthere is overwhelming evidence. As the trial Court has found the evidence of\n\nprosecution witnesses reliable, we hold that prosecution has succeeded in\n\nproving the offence under Section 498-A of the Code of 1860. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1532476\" id=\"span_32\">In this regard,\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/1532476/\" id=\"a_53\">Keshab Chandra Panda</a> (supra) it has been observed that :-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">         &quot;<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 304-B</a> and <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_55\">498-A</a> IPC cannot be held to be\n         mutually exclusive. These provisions deal with two distinct\n         offences. It is true that cruelty is a common essential to\n         both the sections and that has to be proved. The\n         Explanation to Section 498-A gives the meaning of\n         &quot;cruelty&quot;. In section 304-B there is no such Explanation\n         about the meaning of &quot;cruelty&quot;. But having regard to\n         common background to these offences it has to be taken\n         that the meaning of &quot;cruelty or harassment&quot; is the same\n         as prescribed in the Explanation to Section 498-A under\n         which &quot;cruelty&quot; by itself amounts to an offence. Under\n         Section 304-B it is &quot;dowry death&quot; that is punishable and\n         such death should have occurred within seven years of\n         marriage. No such period is mentioned in Section 498-A.\n         A person charged and acquitted under Section 304-B can\n         be convicted under Section 498-A without that charge\n         being there, if such a case is made out. If the case is\n         established there can be a conviction under both the\n         sections.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">41.     Therefore, we have no reason to interfere with the finding of\n\nconviction under     498-A of the Code of 1860. We hereby confirm the\n\nconviction of the appellants under Section 498-A of the Code of 1860.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                           17                      Cr.A.
