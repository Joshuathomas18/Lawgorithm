They\n               were apparently not satisfied working on temporary\n               basis for long number of years. Employees of all the\n               units of BPL Engineering Ltd. formed a common trade\n               union.         Thereafter, they applied for registration of\n               the       Union.               Management       of       BPL     opposed     the\n               registration.                  The Union was still registered and\n               management filed an appeal against the said order of\n               registration with the Assistant Labour Commissioner,\n               in which show cause notice was issued to the Union.\n               However, on challenge being raised by the Union to\n               the said show cause notice by filing a petition,\n               purportedly            under         <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Articles      226</a>    and    <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_2\">227</a>    of   the\n               Constitution             of     India,      High     Court      of    Karnataka,\n               Bangalore, was pleased to quash the said show cause\n               notice.          Thus, the registered Union of BPL                      and its\n               employees affiliated to CITU came into existence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">      4.       The registered Trade Union, thus, as was expected,\n               placed charter of demands before the management for\n               regularization of all temporary employees who had\n               been working for long number of years. As the prayer\n               of     the       Union         was    not    acceded      to     by    the   BPL\n               management, the members of the Union held Dharnas,\n               protests and meetings, outside factory premises at\n               different units of BPL.

On careful examination of the deposition of PW-42,\n               Ashwathappa, it is found that even though he had\n               denied lodging of complaint with the police, but on\n               examination of deposition of PW-56, Suresh Naidu,\n               CPI Ashoknagar P.S., it is found that he has stated\n               that      PW-42,        Ashwathappa,             had    come   to    the      police\n               station along with a typed complaint, which was then\n               registered and FIR was lodged. Subsequently it was\n               sent        to       the        court       of     XI     Additional           Chief\n               Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore. Thus it is not\n               possible on account of the above said discrepancies\n               in the evidence to ascertain the origin of the typed\n               complaint. Thereby we can not totally negate the\n               possibility of the complaint being dictated by the\n               company officials. Moreover there is no secondary\n               evidence led to ascertain the veracity of the FIR.\n               Under such circumstances it would not be correct for\n               us to wholly place our reliance on the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">      28.      Learned counsel for the appellants then contended,\n               if FIR and dying declarations are discarded, then\n               nothing would survive to hold the appellants guilty\n               for     commission             of   serious       offence.

On the other hand, learned counsel for respondent\n               M/s Anitha Shenoy and Rashmi Nandakumar strenuously\n               contended that trial court had properly appreciated\n               the      evidence         available      on    record       and    thereafter\n               only, convicted seven accused.

Thus, their statements recorded\n               under Section 161 CrPC, after their death would be\n               treated as dying declarations and the High Court\n               committed no error of law in doing so.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_32\">      31.

PW1, PW2, PW4, PW9, PW12, PW13, PW14,\n               PW15      assigned             him    the    role     of    shouting      slogans.\n               However PW4, PW12, PW13, PW14, assigned him further\n               role, in addition to shouting slogans.                              PW3, PW5 and\n               PW11 assigned him some other roles, different from\n               shouting slogans.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">      47.      Coming to the case of A46-Sharath Kumar, all have\n               identified him correctly but PW3, PW4, PW5 PW6, PW8,\n               PW10, PW12 and PW14 did not depose about him at all.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">      48.      The majority of witnesses assigned him the role of\n               assaulting with clubs.                       However, PW9, PW13 assigned\n               different role to him but Doctor&#x27;s evidence does not\n               disclose           anywhere that the injuries sustained                         by\n               any of the injured persons could have been caused\n               with clubs, meaning thereby there was no mention\n               with regard to cause of injury.                             Thus, he can also\n               be given benefit of doubt.                        In view of the aforesaid\n               inconsistencies available on record, it would not be\n               safe to convict him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">      49.      It      may      be      mentioned            herein       that     in    criminal\n               jurisprudence, evidence has to be evaluated on the\n               touchstone of consistency.                          Needless to emphasise,\n               consistency             is       the        keyword     for       upholding     the\n               conviction of an accused. In this regard it is to be\n               noted that this Court in the case titled Suraj Singh\n\fCrl.A. Nos. 1028-1029 of 2008 .... (contd.)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                               19</span>\n               v. State of U.P. reported in 2008 (11) SCR 286 has\n               held:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                      &quot;The evidence must be tested for its\n                      inherent   consistency   and   the   inherent\n                      probability of the story; consistency with\n                      the account of other witness is held to be\n                      creditworthy. The probative value of such\n                      evidence becomes eligible to be put into the\n                      scales for a cumulative evaluation.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">      50.      In a criminal trial, evidence of the eye witness\n               requires a careful assessment and must be evaluated\n               for its creditability. Since the fundamental aspect\n               of     criminal          jurisprudence   rests   upon    the    stated\n               principle that &quot;no man is guilty until proven so&quot;,\n               hence utmost caution is required to be exercised in\n               dealing         with      situations   where   there    are   multiple\n               testimonies and equally large number of witnesses\n               testifying before the court. There must be a string\n               that should join the evidence of all the witnesses\n               and thereby satisfying the test of consistency in\n               evidence amongst all the witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">      51.      As has already been mentioned hereinabove A6-P.A.\n               Bharathkumar has not preferred any appeal as his\n               whereabouts are not known.               Thus, these appeals have\n               no concern with his conviction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">      52.      Normally, it is not in practice to consider each and\n               every individual evidence available; however we had\n               to make an exception in this case since it involved\n               certain alleged odious deeds of few individuals. In\n               order to impart full and substantial justice, we\n               made this exception.

The       applications               mainly         pertained        to\n               securing           of      certain          materials,              documents        and\n               witnesses to establish their defence. At the very\n               outset        it     is        pertinent      to      mention        that     in    this\n               particular            matter        there        has      been      an     inordinate\n               delay, despite the High Court granting six months\n               for      the       completion          of     the      trial        and    thereafter\n               another three months&#x27; extension was sought by the\n               trial court. As per <a href=\"/doc/691979/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 233</a>, the trial court can\n               refuse securing of defence evidence if it so feels\n               that the same is being done to further delay the\n               trial. The trial court had considered the judgment\n               of the High Court of Karnataka in Crl. Rev. Petition\n               No.     677/03,         touching         almost          the   identical          issue,\n               where in it was held that the defence evidence has\n               to be led without summoning of any documents and the\n               counsel for the defence has conceded to the said\n               point. Thus, we are of the opinion that trial court\n               has      committed             no   error        in      rejecting         the     above\n               applications.
