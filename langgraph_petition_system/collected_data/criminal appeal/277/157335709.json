In a village - Bhaismudi in District  Janjgir,  there  were  two\n      groups of villagers. One group consisted of deceased - Jawahar  Singh,\n      Bhupendra Singh and others whereas the other group  consisted  of  the\n      appellants herein and other accused.  There were disputes between  the\n      two groups on account of Panchayat elections in the village  and  also\n      several other reasons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">      6.    In the intervening night  of  16th  &amp;  17th  January  1995,  the\n      accused persons convened a meeting and  hatched  up  a  conspiracy  to\n      eliminate Jawahar Singh and others. The  accused  persons  accordingly\n      formed an unlawful assembly with a common object to murder Viki Singh,\n      Jawahar Singh, Bhupendra  Singh,  Shailendra  Singh  -  both  sons  of\n      Jawahar Singh, and  Kalicharan  and  in  furtherance  of  this  common\n      object, all accused persons with deadly weapons (lathi, sword, ballam,\n      Tabbals, iron roads) first went to the residence of Viki Singh near  a\n      place called Nawa Talab, and killed Viki Singh by severely beating him\n      with the weapons which they had carried with them. The accused persons\n      then proceeded towards the agriculture field of  Jawahar  Singh  where\n      they killed Jawahar Singh and his  two  sons  -  Bhupendra  Singh  and\n      Shailendra Singh by severely beating them with the weapons, which they\n      were carrying with them. Thereafter, the accused party proceeded to  a\n      place called - Holha Chowk of Bhaismudi and  killed   Kalicharan  with\n      the aid of same weapons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">      7.

She  and  her  mother  also  followed  them  and\n           requested that once they should save their life,  but  they  did\n           not accede to their request.  While going  to  the  agricultural\n           field, she informed Vinay Singh that Babuji  has  been  murdered\n           near Nawa Talab, Nirmal Kashyap, Amrit, Basant  and  Baran  were\n           also along with them.  After reaching  the  agricultural  field,\n           these persons attacked her father  Jawahar  Singh  and  brothers\n           Bhupender Singh and Shailender Singh with lathi and Tabbal as  a\n           result of which her father Jawahar Singh and  brother  Bhupender\n           Singh   succumbed   to   the   injuries   sustained   by    them\n           instantaneously, and brother Shailender Singh succumbed  to  the\n           injuries after 15-20 minutes.  All these persons have  committed\n           the murder of her father and brothers.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">      9.

Dr  P.K.\n      Narula (PW-12) conducted post-mortem on the body  of  Bhupendra  Singh\n      (Ex-P-56).  In his opinion, the cause of death of Bhupendra Singh  was\n      due to shock as  a  result  of  hemorrhage  on  account  of  extensive\n      homicidal head injury. Dr. U.C. Sharma (PW-13)  conducted  post-mortem\n      on the body of Jawahar Singh, who vide  his  report  (Ex.P-59)  opined\n      that cause of death of Jawahar Singh was due to shock  and  hemorrhage\n      as a result of extensive head injury and that the death  is  homicidal\n      in nature.  Dr. A.K. Paliwal (PW- 14)  conducted  post-mortem  on  the\n      body of Shailendra Singh and vide his  report  (Ex-P-61)  opined  that\n      cause of death was due to shock resulting from  hemorrhage  caused  by\n      extensive head injury and that death is homicidal in nature.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">      11.   After  completing  the  investigation  and  collecting  all  the\n      evidence, the charge-sheet was filed against 29  accused  persons  for\n      commission of offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_14\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_15\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_16\">149</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_17\">302</a>\n      of the IPC in the Court of Judicial Magistrate First Class,  Janjigir,\n      who in turn committed the case to the Session Judge, Bilaspur, who  in\n      turn transferred it to  the  Additional  Sessions  Judge.  During  the\n      trial, one of the accused - Prahlad Singh, died.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">      12.   Prosecution examined as many as 22 witnesses  at  the  trial  to\n      prove the case.

They  stated\n      that they were falsely implicated in the crime and are thus  innocent.\n      One of the accused, Ganesh, stated that the deceased and  their  party\n      members were indulged in selling illicit liquor and since  members  of\n      their party -Shiv Sena were not allowing them to do  such  acts  which\n      included accused, who were also the members of Shiv  Sena,  they  were\n      falsely involved in this case due to this grudge against them. He also\n      stated that since in  Panchayat  elections,  some  candidates  of  the\n      deceased party had lost the election and hence, they were  hostile  to\n      the accused persons. Another accused - Gopal Das stated  that  on  the\n      date of incident, he was at Raigarh for medical test.  The accused  in\n      defence examined Lalit Kumar (DW-1) and Dinesh Chandra Pathak (DW-2).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">      13.   The trial Court, by judgment dated 12.07.2001,  acquitted  eight\n      accused and  convicted  the  remaining  accused.   All  the  convicted\n      appellants were directed to undergo life  imprisonment  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_20\">Section\n      302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_21\">Sections 148</a> and <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_22\">149</a> with a fine of Rs. 2000/- each.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">      14.

Against this judgment of the High Court, the  convicted  accused\n      persons have preferred these appeals before this Court questioning the\n      correctness of the impugned judgment in so far as their conviction and\n      sentence is concerned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">      17.    Learned  Counsel  for  the  appellants,  while  assailing   the\n      conviction and sentence of the appellants,  contended  that  the  High\n      Court was not right in upholding the conviction of the appellants.  It\n      was further contended that there was no role  played  by  any  of  the\n      appellants in the commission of the offence in question  and  nor  was\n      there any overt act played by any of them so as to render them  liable\n      to suffer conviction and sentence under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections  302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_24\">147</a>/<a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_25\">148</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_26\">149</a>  of\n      the IPC. Learned Counsel urged that non-examination of Kariya Sabaria,\n      who was important eyewitness even according to  the  prosecution,  has\n      rendered the  appellants’  conviction  bad  in  law.  Learned  counsel\n      maintained that where group of persons commits any crime,  it  becomes\n      necessary for the prosecution to prove the role  of  every  person  of\n      such group in commission of the offence including  what  every  person\n      actually did such as whether he actually assaulted the deceased, which\n      weapon he used, how much force he  used,  whether  he  was  aggressor,\n      whether his role was prominent and if so to what extent  etc.  Learned\n      Counsel submitted that since evidence adduced by  the  prosecution  is\n      lacking on these material issues and  hence  the  appellants  must  be\n      given the benefit of doubt and they be acquitted of the charges  alike\n      those acquitted by the trial court and the High Court and  lastly,  it\n      was  urged that since the conviction is based solely on the  testimony\n      of interested witnesses (PW-  1  and  3),  who  were  related  to  the\n      deceased persons and, therefore, their testimony was not reliable  for\n      convicting the appellants for  want  of  any  other  independent  eye-\n      witness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">      18.   Learned  Counsel  for  the  respondent-State,  in  reply,  while\n      supporting the impugned judgment contended that no case is made out to\n      call for any  interference  in  the  impugned  judgment.  Firstly,  he\n      submitted that the High Court was right in upholding  the  appellants’\n      conviction  and sentence; secondly,  both  the  courts  below  rightly\n      appreciated  the  evidence  adduced  by  the  prosecution,  which  was\n      sufficient in the ordinary course to sustain the finding of conviction\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_28\">Sections 147</a>/<a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_29\">148</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_30\">149</a> of IPC; thirdly,  the\n      appellants’  conviction  was  based  on  the  testimony  of  two  eye-\n      witnesses, namely,  Madhubala Bai (PW-1) and  Saraswati  Bai,  (PW-3),\n      whose presence at the time of occurrence was not  disputed;  fourthly,\n      keeping in view the law laid down by this Court in  several  decisions\n      explaining therein the parameters  to be applied  for  convicting  any\n      member of unlawful  assembly,  the  prosecution  was  able  to  adduce\n      sufficient evidence to sustain the appellants’ conviction; and lastly,\n      looking to the gruesome murders committed by the appellants killing as\n      many as five persons with a pre-determined motive,  this Court  should\n      uphold the conviction and sentence of  all  the  appellants,  who  are\n      sailing in the same boat and dismiss these appeals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">      19.

We\n      are of the considered opinion that it is homicidal in  nature.  It  is\n      amply established from the medical evidence of three  doctors  namely,\n      Dr. P.K. Narula (PW-12), Dr. U.C.

Before we peruse the ocular evidence adduced by the prosecution,\n      it is necessary to take note of the law on the question  as  to  under\n      what circumstances, a member of an unlawful assembly can  be  held  to\n      have committed an offence in pursuance of the common  object  of  such\n      assembly of which he is a member.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"808611\" id=\"span_1\">22.

State of Uttar  Pradesh</a>,  AIR\n           1956 SC 181, …….., it was observed by Sinha, J., who  spoke  for\n           the Court that it is  well-settled  that  mere  presence  in  an\n           assembly does not make a person, who is present, a member of  an\n           unlawful assembly unless it is shown that he had done  something\n           or omitted to do something which would make him a member  of  an\n           unlawful assembly, or unless the case falls  under  <a href=\"/doc/1364868/\" id=\"a_33\">Section  142</a>\n           IPC.  The  argument  is  that  evidence  adduced  used  by   the\n           prosecution in the present case does  not  assign  any  specific\n           part to most of the accused persons in  relation  to  any  overt\n           act, and so, the High Court was in error  in  holding  that  the\n           appellants      were      members      of      an       unlawful\n           assembly.......................................................\n           It appears that in the case of Baladin the members of the family\n           of the  appellants  and  other  residents  of  the  village  had\n           assembled together; some of them shared the common object of the\n           unlawful assembly, while others were merely  passive  witnesses.\n           Dealing with such an assembly,  this  Court  observed  that  the\n           presence of a person in an  assembly  of  that  kind  would  not\n           necessarily show that he was a member of an  unlawful  assembly.\n           What has to be proved against a person who is alleged  to  be  a\n           member of an unlawful assembly is that he was one of the persons\n           constituting the assembly and he entertained long with the other\n           members of the assembly the common object as defined by  <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_34\">Section\n           141</a> IPC <a href=\"/doc/1364868/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 142</a> provides that however, being aware of  facts\n           which render any assembly  an  unlawful  assembly  intentionally\n           joins that assembly, or continue in it, is said to be  a  member\n           of an unlawful assembly. In other words, an assembly of five  or\n           more persons actuated by, and entertaining one or  more  of  the\n           common object specified by the five clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_36\">Section  141</a>,  is\n           an unlawful assembly. The crucial question to determine in  such\n           a case is whether the assembly consisted of five or more persons\n           and whether the said persons entertained  one  or  more  of  the\n           common objects as specified by <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_37\">Section  141</a>.  While  determining\n           this question, it  becomes  relevant  to  consider  whether  the\n           assembly consisted of  some  persons  who  were  merely  passive\n           witnesses and had joined  the  assembly  as  a  matter  of  idle\n           curiosity without intending to entertain the  common  object  of\n           the assembly. It is in that context that the  observations  made\n           by this Court in  the  case  of  Baladin   assume  significance;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">           otherwise, in law, it would not be correct to say that before  a\n           person is held to be a member of an unlawful assembly,  it  must\n           be shown that he had committed some illegal  overt  act  or  had\n           been guilty of some illegal omission in pursuance of the  common\n           object of the assembly. In fact, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 149</a> makes it clear that\n           if an offence is committed by any member of an unlawful assembly\n           in prosecution of the common object of that assembly, or such as\n           the members of that assembly knew to be likely to  be  committed\n           in prosecution of that object, every person who, at the time  of\n           the committing  of  that  offence,  is  a  member  of  the  same\n           assembly, is guilty  of  that  offence;  and  that  emphatically\n           brings out the  principle  that  the  punishment  prescribed  by\n           <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 149</a> is in a sense vicarious and does not always  proceed\n           on the basis that the offence has  been  actually  committed  by\n           every  member  of  the  unlawful  assembly.  Therefore,  we  are\n           satisfied that the observations made in  the  case  of  Baladin2\n           must be read in the context of the special facts  of  that  case\n           and cannot be treated as laying down an unqualified  proposition\n           or law…..”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"106020319\" id=\"span_3\">23.

State of  U.P.</a>,AIR  1965  SC  202\n           which distinguished the observations made in Baladin AIR 1956 SC\n           181 on the foundation that <a href=\"/doc/1048134/\" id=\"a_43\">the said decision</a> should be  read  in\n           the context of the special facts of the  case  and  may  not  be\n           treated as laying down an unqualified proposition  of  law.  The\n           four-Judge Bench, after enunciating  the  principle,  stated  as\n           follows: (AIR p.       211, para 17)\n                 “17. … it would not be correct to say that before a  person\n                 is held to be a member of an unlawful assembly, it must  be\n                 shown that he had committed some illegal overt act  or  had\n                 been guilty of some illegal [pic]omission in  pursuance  of\n                 the common object of the assembly.  In  fact,  <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_44\">Section  149</a>\n                 makes it clear that if  an  offence  is  committed  by  any\n                 member of an unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common\n                 object of that assembly, or such as  the  members  of  that\n                 assembly knew to be likely to be committed  in  prosecution\n                 of that object, every person who, at the time of committing\n                 of that offence, is a  member  of  the  same  assembly,  is\n                 guilty of that offence; and that  emphatically  brings  out\n                 the principle that the punishment prescribed by <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 149</a>\n                 is in a sense vicarious and does not always proceed on  the\n                 basis that the offence has been actually committed by every\n                 member of the unlawful assembly”.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      24.   Keeping the aforesaid principle of law in mind, when  we  peruse\n      the prosecution evidence, we  have  no  hesitation  in  upholding  the\n      findings of the courts below. We do this for the following reasons.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      25.   In the first place, names of  these  accused  are  mentioned  in\n      Dehati Nalish (Ex-P-1). Secondly, their names are  also  mentioned  in\n      the statements of P.W-1 and P.W-3, which were recorded  under  <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_46\">Section\n      161</a> of the Cr.P.C.  Likewise these two witnesses (PWs 1  and  3)  also\n      categorically stated in their evidence in Court about  the  overt  act\n      played by the accused persons in committing  the  murders  of  Jawahar\n      Singh and his two sons, Bhupendra and Shailendra. In  other  words,  a\n      conjoint reading of these two statements clearly establishes the overt\n      acts played by the accused persons while killing these  three  persons\n      one after another on the same day.  Thirdly and most importantly,  the\n      ocular evidence of two eye witnesses (PWs 1 and 3) conclusively  prove\n      not only the involvement of  the  accused  persons  but  their  actual\n      active role played in killing these three persons. We have  undertaken\n      the exercise of appreciating the evidence and especially  of  two  eye\n      witnesses (PWs 1 and 3) and  we  find  that  their  sworn  testimonies\n      deserve to be accepted.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      26.   It is not in dispute, as it has come in evidence, that Madhubala\n      (PW-1) is the daughter of the deceased- Jawahar Singh, and  sister  of\n      the deceased Bhupendra and Shailendra, whereas Saraswati Bai (PW-3) is\n      the wife of the deceased Jawahar and mother of Madhubala   (PW-1)  and\n      the deceased Bhupendra and Shailendra.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      27.   In the case on hand, the mother  and  daughter  saw  from  their\n      naked eyes that their father/husband and two sons/brothers were  being\n      killed in their presence with the use of Lathis, battle axe, sword and\n      rods by the accused persons mercilessly and both the  helpless  ladies\n      standing in front of the  mob  (accused  persons)  with  folded  hands\n      praying &quot;please do not kill them and leave them&quot;.  The accused persons\n      did not listen to their prayer and with a pre-determined motive killed\n      the deceased persons by beating them due to which two of them died  on\n      the spot and one succumbed in the hospital after some time.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      28.   It will be a travesty of justice, if we do not believe the sworn\n      testimonies of  these  two  eye-witnesses,  which  in  our  considered\n      opinion, remained consistent throughout on  material  issues.
