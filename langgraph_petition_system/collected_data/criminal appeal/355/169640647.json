Appellant No.1\nRajendra @ Raja has also been convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1961417/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 25</a>(1-B) A\nof the Arms and has been sentenced to undergo rigorous\nimprisonment of 03 years with fine of Rs.1,000/- with default\nstipulation. Remaining three appellants namely Rajkumar, Sanjay\nand Ramsingh have also been convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1961417/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 25(1)</a>(1-B)\n(B) of the Arms and have been sentenced to undergo rigorous\nimprisonment of 1-1 year with fine of Rs.1,000/- each with default\nstipulation.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                 -3-</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">                                             Criminal Appeal No.1243/2009\n\n\n\n      As per the prosecution story, on 04/11/2008 police got a\ndiscrete information from the informant that appellants Rajkumar,\nSanjay @ Sanju, Ramsingh and Rajendra along with other\ncompanions are planning for committing dacoity on Highway.\nActing upon the said information, four police parties reached on the\nspot. Police heard the conversation regarding planning of dacoity on\nNational Highway. All the appellants / accused persons were\narrested by the police. Police recovered a country made pistol\n(Katta) of 315 bore with cartridges from the possession of the\nappellant Rajendra. Police has also recovered knives from the\npossession of other three appellants. One unknown miscreant has\nbeen fled away from the spot. Hence, FIR has been registered\nagainst the accused persons / appellants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">      After completion of investigation, charge sheet was filed in\nthe matter under <a href=\"/doc/399026/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 399</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1784492/\" id=\"a_7\">402</a> of the IPC and <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 25</a> of\nthe Arms Act. After framing of charges, appellants denied all the\nallegations levelled against them. Prosecution in order to bring\nhome the guilt, examined as well as eight witnesses. Appellants /\naccused persons did not examine any witness in their defence. After\nconclusion of the trial, learned trial Court, on appreciation of\nevidence available on record, delivered the impugned judgment\naccordingly and convicted and sentenced the appellants as stated\nherein above.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_4\">      The appellants have preferred this appeal on several grounds\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                  -4-</span>\n                                               Criminal Appeal No.1243/2009\n\n\n\nstating that the learned trial Court has failed to appreciate the facts\nand circumstances of reasonably and properly. The judgment of the\ntrial Court is contrary to the law and facts on record. Same is\nneither legal nor proper. Prosecution case is not supported by\nindependent witnesses and there are so many contradictions and\nomissions in the statement of the prosecution witnesses. The trial\nCourt has not considered the material contradictions and omissions\nand is also wrong in drawing unwarranted inference. The appellants\nare facing the trial since 2009. They have no criminal background\nand therefore, the appeal be allowed and conviction and sentence\nawarded to the appellants be set aside.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">      Per contra, learned Panel Lawyer for the respondent / State\nsupported the impugned judgment passed by the trial Court and\nprays for dismissal of the present appeal by stating that the trial\nCourt after appreciating the evidence available on record in detail\ncome to the conclusion. The learned trial Court did not committed\nany mistake in holding that the appellants are guilty for all the\noffences, therefore, present appeal deserves to be dismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">      Learned counsel for both the parties are heard at length and\nperused the record of the trial Court with due care.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">      According to the statement of Inspector Daulat Singh (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">8), he was posted as in-charge of Police Station Mahakal, Ujjain on\n03/11/2008. He got information from the informer that accused\nRajendra @ Raja along with other accused persons Rajkumar,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                 -5-</span>\n                                              Criminal Appeal No.1243/2009\n\n\n\nSanjay @ Sanju and Ramsingh along with other companions are\nless with country made pistol (Katta) and knives and they are\nmaking preparation to commit dacoity on the Highway. As a result\nof which, he entered the said information in Rojnamcha Sanha\nNo.302 and prepared four police parties. He along with police party\nproceed to catch hold the miscreants nearby the Mullapura to\nChintaman. When he reached the spot, he heard that accused\npersons were conversing that they would commit dacoity on\nHighway. According to this witness, police party caught hold the\naccused persons. They have disclosed their names as Rajendra,\nRajkumar, Sanju and Ramsingh. On the spot, he has recovered a\ncountry made pistol (Katta) of 315 bore and a Bajaj Discover\nMotorcycle from the possession of the accused Rajendra through\nseizure memo (Ex.-P/7). He also recovered knives from the\npossession of the Rajkumar, Sanjay and Ramsingh through seizure\nmemo (Ex.-P/8, P/9 and P/10).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">      Similar is the statement of Indra Vikram Singh (PW.1), PSI\nRajesh Patel (PW.4), ASI Ramdas Yadav (PW.7).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">      Independent witness Manish (PW.5) was examined by the\nprosecution, but he has turned hostile and has not supported the\ncase of the prosecution. He has categorically stated in his statement\nthat he had signed document Exhibits P/3 to P/10, but he did not\nknow the accused persons and the aforementioned offence. All the\naccused persons neither arrested before him nor recovered anything\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                 -6-</span>\n                                             Criminal Appeal No.1243/2009\n\n\n\nfrom the possession of accused persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">      It is first to be point out that there was no independent\nwitness in support of the prosecution and explanation is that there\nbeing no village near the spot where the incident took place, no\nindependent public witnesses could be available. I do not mean to\nsay that as a matter of Rule, the prosecution version cannot be\naccepted unless supported by independent public witnesses. In the\npresent case, Manish (PW.5) turned hostile and other independent\nwitnesses were not examined therefore, in view of the other\ncircumstances, taken together with the non-support of independent\nwitnesses, create reasonable doubt as to the happening as alleged by\nthe prosecution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">      It is also noteworthy that all the appellants were allegedly\nfound in possession of the pistol and knifes, but as per the\nprosecution, there was no exchange of any resistance from the\nappellants. It is obviously, the matter of arrest or escape of the\naccused. There could be hardly be any point in their keeping arms\nand ammunition if they did not intend to use the same, even when\nchallenged. The conduct assigned to the appellants does not attract\nof logic therefore, this fact becomes doubtful that appellants were\ncarrying any deadly weapon for the purpose of commission of\ncrime or dacoity or any other crime.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1945860\" id=\"span_5\">There is nothing to show that except alleged bald talking, the\nmiscreants have taken any further step for the purpose of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                 -7-</span>\n                                              Criminal Appeal No.1243/2009\n\n\n\ncommitting dacoity. Even there is no such version that the\nmiscreants have started going for that purpose. It would be pertinent\nto mention that in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1945860/\" id=\"a_9\">Shridhar Koeri vs. State of Bihar</a>,\n2001 (43) SCC 5, the Apex Court has held that the mere fact that\nthe accused was arrested on the spot and some articles including\nfire arms were recovered from his possession would not be\nsufficient to prove the charge that they had assembled for making\npreparation of commission of dacoity.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">      It is established law that the guilt of the accused must be\nproved beyond all reasonable doubts. Burden of proving its case\nbeyond reasonable doubt lies upon prosecution and it never shifts.\nAnother golden thread, which runs through the web of the\nadministration of justice in criminal cases is that if two views are\npossible on the evidence adduced and the other to his innocence, the\nview which is favourable to the accused should be adopted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">      There are so many material contradictions and omissions in\nthe statements of Inspector Daulat Singh (PW.8) and other\nwitnesses. Daulat Singh (PW.8) stated in his cross examination that\nhe has made spot map Exhibit P/12 on the spot, but Hari Singh\nThakur (PW.6) has stated that no such document has been written\non the spot. Daulat Singh (PW.8) has stated that he saw the\nmiscreants from the distance of 50 Fts., but Indra Vikram Singh\n(PW.1) has stated that he cannot say that what the distance between\naccused persons and police. Rajesh Patel has also stated that he saw\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                  -8-</span>\n                                                Criminal Appeal No.1243/2009\n\n\n\nthe accused persons from distance of 10 - 20 Metres. As per\nRamdas (PW.7), the distance was between 10 - 15 Fts. Ramdas\n(PW.7) also stated that at the time of incident there was completely\ndark whereas Indra Vikram Singh (PW.1) has stated that there was\nmoon light. Per contra, Daulat Singh (PW.8) has stated that they\nhave reached on the spot near about 11.45 PM, but Ramdas has\nstated that they reached on the spot about 11.00 AM to 12.30 AM.\nThere are so many other contradictions in the statements of these\nwitnesses of seizure of the arms, preparation of seizure memo and\nidentification of the accused persons therefore, in view of the\naforesaid material contradictions and omissions statements all these\nwitnesses appears to be doubtful.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">      Admittedly, police arrested the accused persons at night time\nand incident has taken place at night, but there is no evidence\navailable on record to show that there was any source of light\navailable on the spot. It is very strange to gather as to how the\npolice officials identified the accused persons in the dark night. It is\nalso noteworthy that the seized arms were not produced before the\ntrial Court during the examination of seizure witnesses. Seizure\narms were not properly sealed and it is also doubtful when did all\nthese arms kept in the Maalkhana of the concerned police station,\ntherefore, seizure of these arms become so doubtful.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">      In the instance case, considering the entire evidence, it\nreveals that prosecution version lacks genuineness and authenticity.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                   -9-</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">                                                 Criminal Appeal No.1243/2009\n\n\n\nThe prosecution version appears unnatural as it is quite improbable\nthat the said police could have heard any such conversation of\nappellants that they were saying that they would commit dacoity.\nEven otherwise, mere alleged conversation hardly fulfills the\nnecessary ingredients of offence under <a href=\"/doc/399026/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 399</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1784492/\" id=\"a_11\">402</a> of\nIPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"57465840\" id=\"span_9\">The High Court of Orissa, Cuttack in the case of <a href=\"/doc/57465840/\" id=\"a_12\">Jaganath\nMundari vs. State of Odisha, JCRLA No.75/2016</a> in para No.9 has\nheld as under :-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           &quot;9. <a href=\"/doc/399026/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 399</a> of the Indian Penal Code deals\n           with making preparation to commit dacoity and\n           <a href=\"/doc/1784492/\" id=\"a_14\">section 402</a> of the Indian Penal Code deals with\n           assembling for purpose of committing dacoity.\n           There is manifestly a distinction between the\n           offences under section 399 and <a href=\"/doc/1784492/\" id=\"a_15\">section 402</a> of the\n           Indian Penal Code.

Preparation for\n           committing a dacoity may take place before or\n           after the dacoits assemble together.
