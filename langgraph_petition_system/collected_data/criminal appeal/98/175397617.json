After about three months of marriage, the\n\ndeceased gave a telephonic call to her father about the\n\ndemand for dowry. Her father, Kashmiri Lal (PW-3), along\n\nwith his younger brother Raghubir Lal (PW-12), met the\n\nhusband of the deceased and his other relatives and\n\npleaded that she may not be harassed as he was not in a\n\nposition to give more dowry.       The accused, however,\n\ncontinued to harass her. On 29th April, 2001, the deceased\n\nagain telephoned her father about the harassment on which\n\nRaghubir Lal (PW-12) went to the house of the accused and\n\nbrought back the deceased to her parental home. However,\n\non the next day, the appellant came to the place of his in-\n\nlaws and insisted that the deceased be sent with him,\n\nthreatening that otherwise he will divorce her. On this, the\n\ndeceased was sent with the appellant.      Next day, on 1 st\n\nMay, 2001, at about 12 O’clock, information was received\n\nby the family of the deceased that she had received burn\n\ninjuries and was taken to the hospital.

SI Rakham Singh (PW-13) conducted the\n\ninvestigation and sent up the accused for trial.             The\n\nprosecution led evidence in support of its case comprising\n\nof relatives to prove demand of dowry, apart from medical\n\nevidence and evidence of investigation. The accused denied\n\nthe prosecution allegations and stated that the deceased\n\ncommitted suicide on account of harassment by her uncle\n\nRaghubir Lal (PW-12) who wanted her to relinquish her\n\nrights in the parental property.       The accused examined\n\nVinod Kumar (DW-1) who had taken the deceased to the\n\nhospital and stated that her relations with the accused were\n\ncordial.

Appearing on behalf of the appellant, learned counsel\n\n              Shri G.C. Shahpuri submitted that the prosecution failed to\n\n              prove the demand of dowry “soon before the death” which\n\n              was the necessary ingredient for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_3\">Section\n\n              304</a> B, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_4\">IPC</a>.

He lastly submitted that\n\n              since the High Court had acquitted mother and brother of\n\n              the appellant on the same evidence, the case of the\n\n              appellant being at par, there was no justification to convict\n\n              him.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">1 AIR (2014) SC 2555\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                                  4</span>\n                                                                         Page 4\n\f                                  Criminal Appeal No.1266 of 2013\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">8.   We have given due consideration to the submissions\n\nadvanced on behalf of the appellant but we do not find any\n\nmerit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">9.   There is consistent evidence on record to prove\n\nharassment for dowry soon before the death of the\n\ndeceased. The deceased died within 10 months of the\n\nmarriage.   According to PW3, father of the deceased, after\n\nthree months of the marriage, the deceased informed him\n\nthat the appellant and his family were harassing her for\n\ndowry.   He, along with PW-12, went to the house of the\n\nappellant and requested them not to harass her.          Again,\n\nthree days before the occurrence, on 28 April, 2001, the\n\ndeceased informed her father about the dowry harassment\n\non which her uncle PW-12, along with his wife, went to the\n\nhouse of the accused and brought the deceased to her\n\nparental home. The appellant took her away on the threat\n\nof divorce and on the next day, she died of burn injuries.\n\nSimilar version has been given by Guddar Mal (PW-10) and\n\nRaghubir Lal (PW-12).    The version is supported by her\n\ndeath by burning.    There is no other cogent reason to\n\nexplain the cause of her death except the harassment for\n\ndowry.   There is live and proximate link between the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                              5</span>\n                                                     Page 5\n\f                                        Criminal Appeal No.1266 of 2013\n\n\n\n\ndemand of dowry and death.         In these circumstances, it\n\ncannot be held that there is no evidence of demand of\n\ndowry “soon before the death”.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"76388249\" id=\"span_6\">In <a href=\"/doc/76388249/\" id=\"a_6\">Manohar Lal</a> (supra)\n\nrelied upon on behalf of the appellant, this Court noted that\n\nthere was neither any specific instance suggesting cruelty\n\nor harassment nor any of the witnesses had stated that the\n\ndeceased     was   harassed   “soon      before    the    death”    in\n\nconnection with the demand of dowry. Contrary to the fact\n\nsituation noticed in the said case, in the present case, all\n\nthe three witnesses mentioned above – Kashmiri Lal,\n\nGuddar     Mal   and   Raghubir   Lal    have     specifically     and\n\ncategorically deposed about demand of dowry soon before\n\nher death.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">10.   We may now refer to the suicide note. It, inter alia,\n\nstates :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1949931\" id=\"span_7\">“All the doors are closed for me. Besides\n             this, no other way is available to me and\n             I adopted the way which I liked.”\n\n      The tenor of the suicide note clearly shows that the\n\ndeceased was in helpless condition and she found no other\n\nway to come out of the situation. The suicide note cannot\n\nbe taken to be encyclopaedia of the entire situation in which\n\nthe deceased was placed. It is not possible to infer from the\n\nsaid note that the deceased was happy in her matrimonial\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                    6</span>\n                                                           Page 6\n\f                                    Criminal Appeal No.1266 of 2013\n\n\n\n\nhome. Mere mention that nobody may be held responsible,\n\nwhile also stating that all the doors were closed for her and\n\nshe had no other way available (except to leave the world),\n\nis not enough to exonerate the appellant.       When a young\n\nmarried girl finds herself in helpless situation and decides to\n\nend her life, in absence of any other circumstance, it is\n\nnatural to infer that she was unhappy in her matrimonial\n\nhome.   A suicide note cannot be treated as conclusive of\n\nthere being no one responsible for the situation when\n\nevidence on record categorically points to harassment for\n\ndowry. One cannot lose sight of the fact that unfortunately\n\nthe menace dowry deaths still exists in our society and has\n\nbeen subject of expert studies. The Law Commission, in its\n\n91thst Report dated 10th August, 1983, recommended reform\n\nof the law to deal with the situation which led to\n\nincorporation of <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections 304 B </a>in <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">IPC</a>, making ‘dowry death’\n\nan offence and Section 113B in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_9\">Evidence Act</a> which\n\nprovides for raising a presumption as to dowry death in case\n\nof an unnatural death within seven years of marriage when\n\nit is shown that a woman was subjected to harassment for\n\ndowry soon before her death.

The circumstances have thus to be appreciated in the\n\n               light of the above social and legislative background.              As\n\n               already noted, in the present case, there is plethora of\n\n               evidence to prove the demand of dowry “soon before the\n\n               death” giving rise to the presumption against the appellant.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">               12.   As regards the claim for parity of the case of the\n\n               appellant with his mother and brother who have been\n\n               acquitted, the High Court has rightly found his case to be\n\n               distinguishable from the case of his mother and brother.\n\n               The husband is not only primarily responsible for safety of\n\n               his wife, he is expected to be conversant with her state of\n\n               mind more than any other relative.          If the wife commits\n\n               suicide      by   setting   herself   on   fire,   proceeded       by\n\n               dissatisfaction of the husband and his family from the\n\n               dowry, the interference of harassment against the husband\n\n               may be patent. Responsibility of the husband towards his\n\n               wife is qualitatively different and higher as against his other\n\n               relatives.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">               13.

In\n\nthese circumstances, the case of the appellant cannot stand\n\nat par with his mother and brother who have been acquitted\n\nby the High Court, by way of caution against over\n\nimplication, as well as for want of cogent evidence against\n\nthem.
