Nariman, J.\n</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_1\">1.    Steel products were supplied by the respondent to one M/s.\n\nDiamond Engineering Pvt. Ltd. [“the company”] from 21.09.2015 to\n\n11.11.2016, as a result of which INR 24,20,91,054/- was due and payable\n\nby the company. As many as 51 cheques were issued by the company in\n\nfavour of the respondent towards amounts payable for supplies, all of\n\nwhich were returned dishonoured for the reason “funds insufficient” on\n\n03.03.2017. As a result, on 31.03.2017, the respondent issued a statutory\n\ndemand notice under Section 138 read with <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable\n\nInstruments Act, 1881, calling upon the company and its three Directors,\n\nthe appellants no.1-3 herein, to pay this amount within 15 days of the\n\nreceipt of the notice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.    On 28.04.2017, two cheques for a total amount of INR 80,70,133/-\n\npresented by the respondent for encashment were returned dishonoured\n\nfor the reason “funds insufficient”. A second demand notice dated\n\n05.05.2017 was therefore issued under the selfsame Sections by the\n\nrespondent, calling upon the company and the appellants to pay this\n\namount within 15 days of the receipt of the notice.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                        3</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">\f3.    Since no payment was forthcoming pursuant to the two statutory\n\ndemand notices, two criminal complaints, being Criminal Complaint\n\nNo.SS/552/2017 and Criminal Complaint No. SS/690/2017 dated\n\n17.05.2017 and 21.06.2017, respectively, were filed by the respondent\n\nagainst the company and the appellants under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 138</a> read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 141</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act before the Additional Chief\n\nMetropolitan Magistrate [“ACMM”], Kurla, Mumbai. On 12.02.2018,\n\nsummons were issued by the ACMM to the company and the appellants\n\nin both the criminal complaints.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">4.    Meanwhile, as a statutory notice under <a href=\"/doc/1033371/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 8</a> of the Insolvency\n\nand Bankruptcy Code, 2016 [“IBC”] had been issued on 21.03.2017 by\n\nthe respondent to the company, and as an order dated 06.06.2017 was\n\npassed by the Adjudicating Authority admitting the application under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1680872/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 9</a> of the IBC and directing commencement of the corporate\n\ninsolvency resolution process with respect to the company, a moratorium\n\nin terms of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 14</a> of the IBC was ordered. Pursuant thereto, on\n\n24.05.2018, the Adjudicating Authority stayed further proceedings in the\n\ntwo criminal complaints pending before the ACMM. In an appeal filed to\n\nthe National Company Law Appellate Tribunal [“NCLAT”], the NCLAT set\n\naside this order, holding that <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 138</a>, being a criminal law provision,\n\ncannot be held to be a “proceeding” within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 14</a> of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                          4</span>\n\fthe IBC. In an appeal filed before this Court, on 26.10.2018, this Court\n\nordered a stay of further proceedings in the two complaints pending\n\nbefore the learned ACMM. On 30.09.2019, since a resolution plan\n\nsubmitted by the promoters of the company had been approved by the\n\ncommittee of creditors, the Adjudicating Authority approved such plan as\n\na result of which, the moratorium order dated 06.06.2017 ceased to have\n\neffect. It may only be added that at present, an application for withdrawal\n\nof approval of this resolution plan has been filed by the financial creditors\n\nof the company before the Adjudicating Authority. Equally, an application\n\nto extend time for implementation of this plan has been filed by the\n\nresolution applicant sometime in October 2020 before the Adjudicating\n\nAuthority. Both these applications have yet to be decided by the\n\nAdjudicating Authority, the next date of hearing before such Authority\n\nbeing 08.02.2021.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">5.    The important question that arises in this appeal is whether the\n\ninstitution or continuation of a proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 138</a>/<a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_10\">141</a> of the\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act can be said to be covered by the moratorium\n\nprovision, namely, <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 14</a> of the IBC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">6.    Shri Jayanth Muth Raj, learned Senior Advocate appearing on\n\nbehalf of the appellants, has painstakingly taken us through various\n\nprovisions of the IBC and has argued that the object of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 14</a> being\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                            5</span>\n\fthat the assets of the corporate debtor be preserved during the corporate\n\ninsolvency resolution process, it would be most incongruous to hold that a\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 138</a> proceeding, which, although a criminal proceeding, is in\n\nessence to recover the amount of the bounced cheque, be kept out of the\n\nword “proceedings” contained in <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 14(1)(a)</a> of the IBC. According to\n\nthe learned Senior Advocate, given the object of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 14</a>, there is no\n\nreason to curtail the meaning of the expression “proceedings”, which\n\nwould therefore include all proceedings against the corporate debtor, civil\n\nor criminal, which would result in “execution” of any judgment for payment\n\nof compensation. He emphasised the fact that <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 14(1)(a)</a> was\n\nextremely wide and ought not to be cut down by judicial interpretation\n\ngiven the expression “any” occurring twice in <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 14(1)(a)</a>, thus\n\nemphasising that so long as there is a judgment by any court of law\n\n(which even extends to an order by an authority) which results in coercive\n\nsteps being taken against the assets of the corporate debtor, all such\n\nproceedings are necessarily subsumed within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_18\">Section\n\n14(1)(a)</a>. He also referred to the width of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 14(1)(b)</a> and the\n\nlanguage of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 14(1)(b)</a> and therefore argued that given the object of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 14</a>, no rule of construction, be it ejusdem generis or noscitur a\n\nsociis can be used to cut down the plain meaning of the words used in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 14(1)(a)</a>. He cited a number of judgments in support of this\n\nproposition. He also argued that in any event, even if criminal\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                          6</span>\n\fproceedings properly so-called are to be excluded from <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 14(1)(a)</a>,\n\na <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 138</a> proceeding being quasi-criminal in nature, whose dominant\n\nobject is compensation being payable to the person in whose favour a\n\ncheque is made, which has bounced, the punitive aspect of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 138</a>\n\nbeing only to act as an in terrorem proceeding to achieve this result, it is\n\nclear that in any event, a hybrid proceeding partaking of this nature would\n\ncertainly be covered. He cited a number of judgments in order to buttress\n\nthis proposition as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">7.    Shri Jayant Mehta, learned Advocate appearing on behalf of the\n\nrespondent, rebutted each of these submissions with erudition and grace.\n\nHe referred to the Report of the Insolvency Law Committee of February\n\n2020 to drive home his point that the object of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 14</a> being a limited\n\none, a criminal proceeding could not possibly be included within it. He\n\nfurther went on to juxtapose the moratorium provisions which would apply\n\nin the case of individuals and firms in <a href=\"/doc/1470073/\" id=\"a_27\">Sections 85</a>, <a href=\"/doc/63256/\" id=\"a_28\">96</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/980766/\" id=\"a_29\">101</a> of the IBC,\n\nemphasising that the language of these provisions being wider would, by\n\nway of contrast, include a <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 138</a> proceeding so far as individuals\n\nand firms are concerned, which has been expressly eschewed so far as\n\n<a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 14</a>’s applicability to corporate debtors is concerned. He relied\n\nupon the ejusdem generis/noscitur a sociis rules of construction that had,\n\nin fact, been applied to <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 14(1)(a)</a> by the Bombay High Court and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                           7</span>\n\fthe Calcutta High Court to press home his point that since the expression\n\n“proceedings” takes its colour from the previous expression “suits”, such\n\nproceedings must necessarily be civil in nature. He cited judgments which\n\ndistinguish between civil and criminal proceedings and went on to argue\n\nthat <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 138</a> of the      Negotiable Instruments Act is a criminal\n\nproceeding whose object may be two fold, the primary object being to\n\nmake what was once a civil wrong punishable by a jail sentence and/or\n\nfine. He relied heavily upon judgments which construed like expressions\n\ncontained in <a href=\"/doc/1691689/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 22(1)</a> of the Sick Industrial Companies Act, 1985\n\n[“SICA”], and <a href=\"/doc/1221543/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 446(2)</a> of the Companies Act, 1956. He also was at\n\npains to point out from several judgments that the Delhi High Court had\n\nnot applied <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 14</a> of the IBC to stay proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 34</a> of\n\nthe Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996; the Bombay High Court had not\n\napplied <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 14</a> of the IBC to stay prosecution under the Employees’\n\n<a href=\"/doc/6550002/\" id=\"a_39\">Provident Funds Act, 1952</a>; and that the Delhi High Court had not stayed\n\nproceedings covered by the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_40\">Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002</a>,\n\nstating that criminal proceedings were not the subject matter of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_41\">Section\n\n14</a> of the IBC. He thus supported the judgment under appeal, stating that\n\nthe consistent view of the High Courts has been that <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 138</a>, being a\n\ncriminal law provision, could not possibly be said to be covered by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 14</a> of the IBC. He also relied upon the provision contained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/880124/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 33(5)</a> of the IBC to argue that when a liquidation order is passed,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                         8</span>\n\fno suit or other legal proceeding can be instituted by or against a\n\ncorporate debtor, similar to what is contained in <a href=\"/doc/1537531/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 446</a> of the\n\nCompanies Act, 1956, and if those decisions are seen, then the\n\nexpression “or other legal proceeding” obviously cannot include criminal\n\nproceedings. On the other hand, in any case, the expression “or other\n\nlegal proceeding” should be contrasted with the word “proceedings” in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 14(1)(a)</a> of the IBC, which cannot possibly include a criminal\n\nproceeding, given its object. Lastly, he also relied upon Section 32A of\n\nthe IBC, which was introduced by the <a href=\"/doc/119173698/\" id=\"a_47\">Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code\n\n(Amendment) Act, 2020</a> w.e.f. 28.12.2019, and emphasised the fact that\n\nthe liability of a corporate debtor for an offence committed prior to the\n\ncommencement of the corporate insolvency resolution process shall\n\ncease in certain circumstances. This provision would have been wholly\n\nunnecessary if <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 14(1)(a)</a> were to cover criminal offences as well,\n\nas they would cease for the period of moratorium. Thus, he argued that\n\nthis Section throws considerable light on the fact that criminal\n\nprosecutions are outside the ken of the expression “proceedings”\n\ncontained in <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 14(1)(a)</a> of the IBC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"96973002\" id=\"span_7\">8.   Shri Aman Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor General, appearing on\n\nbehalf of the Union of India in W.P. (Crl.) No. 297/2020, has\n\ncomprehensively taken us through Chapter XVII of the Negotiable\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                        9</span>\n\fInstruments Act to argue that a plain reading of the said Chapter would\n\nreveal that the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 138</a> is a purely criminal offence\n\nwhich results in imposition of a jail sentence or fine or both, being\n\npunishments exclusively awardable under <a href=\"/doc/543586/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 53</a> of the Indian Penal\n\nCode, 1860 only in a criminal proceeding, and hence, does not fall within\n\n“proceedings” contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 14</a> of the IBC. He further states\n\nthat since compounding under criminal law can only take place at the\n\ninstance of the complainant/injured party, a subordinate criminal court has\n\nno inherent power to terminate proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 138</a>/<a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_54\">141</a> upon\n\n“payment of compensation to the satisfaction of the court”. He then relied\n\nupon the rule of noscitur a sociis to state that since the expression\n\n“proceedings” contained in <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 14(1)(a)</a> of the IBC is preceded by the\n\nexpression “suits” and followed by the expression “execution”, it has to be\n\nread in a sense analogous to civil proceedings dealing with private rights\n\nof action as contrasted with criminal proceedings which deal with public\n\nwrongs. According to the learned Additional Solicitor General, the intent\n\nmanifest in <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 14</a> of the IBC is reinforced by the introduction of\n\nSection 32A to the IBC in that if the intent of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 14</a> were to prohibit\n\ninitiation or continuation of criminal proceedings, the legislature would not\n\nhave contemplated the introduction of Section 32A by way of amendment.\n\nHe further states that if the expression “proceedings” contained in <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_58\">Section\n\n14</a> were to be construed so as to include criminal proceedings, it would\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                           10</span>\n\frender the first proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1578249/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 32</a>, which deals with institution of\n\nprosecution against a corporate debtor during the corporate insolvency\n\nresolution process, and the second proviso, which indicates pendency of\n\ncriminal prosecution against those in charge of and responsible for the\n\nconduct of the corporate debtor, otiose. He relied on the judgment in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/96973002/\" id=\"a_60\">Aneeta Hada v.

Under sub-section (2), the supply of essential\n\ngoods or services to the corporate debtor during this period cannot be\n\nterminated or suspended or even interrupted, as otherwise the corporate\n\ndebtor would be brought to its knees and would not able to function as a\n\ngoing concern during this period. The exception created in sub-section (3)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">(a) is important as it refers to “transactions” as may be notified by the\n\nCentral Government in consultation with experts in finance. The\n\nexpression “financial sector regulator” is defined by <a href=\"/doc/1485731/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 3(18)</a> as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      “3.

Thus, the Central Government, in consultation with experts, may\n\nstate that the moratorium provision will not apply to such transactions as\n\nmay be notified. This is of some importance as <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 14(1)(a)</a> does not\n\nindicate as to what the proceedings contained therein apply to. Sub-\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                        14</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/1485731/\" id=\"a_75\">section 3(a)</a> provides the answer – that such “proceedings” relate to\n\n“transactions” entered into by the corporate debtor pre imposition of the\n\nmoratorium. <a href=\"/doc/1485731/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 3(33)</a> defines “transaction” as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      “3. Definitions.—In this Code, unless the context otherwise\n      requires,—\n      xxx xxx xxx\n       (33) “transaction” includes an agreement or arrangement in\n      writing for the transfer of assets, or funds, goods or services,\n      from or to the corporate debtor;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">      xxx xxx xxx”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"163084985\" id=\"span_14\">13.   This definition being an inclusive one is extremely wide in nature\n\nand would include a transaction evidencing a debt or liability. This is made\n\nclear by <a href=\"/doc/63256/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 96(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/980766/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 101(3)</a> which contain the same\n\nlanguage as <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 14(3)(a)</a>, these Sections speaking of ‘debts’ of the\n\nindividual or firm. Equally important is <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 14(3)(b)</a>, by which a surety\n\nin a contract of guarantee of a debt owed by a corporate debtor cannot\n\navail of the benefit of a moratorium as a result of which a creditor can\n\nenforce a guarantee, though not being able to enforce the principal debt\n\nduring the period of moratorium – see <a href=\"/doc/163084985/\" id=\"a_81\">State Bank of India v. V.\n\nRamakrishnan</a>,      (2018)    17   SCC     394   (at   paragraph    20)   [“V.\n\nRamakrishnan”].</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">14.   We now come to the language of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 14(1)(a)</a>. It will be noticed\n\nthat the expression “or” occurs twice in the first part of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 14(1)(a)</a> –\n\nfirst, between the expressions “institution of suits” and “continuation of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                           15</span>\n\fpending suits” and second, between the expressions “continuation of\n\npending suits” and “proceedings against the corporate debtor…”. The\n\nsweep of the provision is very wide indeed as it includes institution,\n\ncontinuation, judgment and execution of suits and proceedings. It is\n\nimportant to note that an award of an arbitration panel or an order of an\n\nauthority is also included. This being the case, it would be incongruous to\n\nhold that the expression “the institution of suits or continuation of pending\n\nsuits” must be read disjunctively as otherwise, the institution of arbitral\n\nproceedings and proceedings before authorities cannot be subsumed\n\nwithin the expression institution of “suits” which are proceedings in civil\n\ncourts instituted by a plaint (see <a href=\"/doc/119152574/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 26</a> of the Code of Civil\n\nProcedure, 1908). Therefore, it is clear that the expression “institution of\n\nsuits or continuation of pending suits” is to be read as one category, and\n\nthe disjunctive “or” before the word “proceedings” would make it clear that\n\nproceedings against the corporate debtor would be a separate category.\n\nWhat throws light on the width of the expression “proceedings” is the\n\nexpression “any judgment, decree or order” and “any court of law,\n\ntribunal, arbitration panel or other authority”. Since criminal proceedings\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_85\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973 [“<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_86\">CrPC</a>”] are conducted\n\nbefore the courts mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/909219/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 6</a>, CrPC, it is clear that a <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_88\">Section\n\n138</a> proceeding being conducted before a Magistrate would certainly be a\n\nproceeding in a court of law in respect of a transaction which relates to a\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                           16</span>\n\fdebt owed by the corporate debtor. Let us now see as to whether the\n\nexpression “proceedings” can be cut down to mean civil proceedings\n\nstricto sensu by the use of rules of interpretation such as ejusdem generis\n\nand noscitur a sociis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">APPLICATION OF           THE     NOSCITUR       A    SOCIIS     RULE     OF\nINTERPRETATION\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_32\">15.

Applying the doctrine of noscitur a sociis, this Court\n\nheld that given the fact that the expression “posting” comes in between\n\n“appointment” and “promotion” of District Judges, it is clear that a\n\nnarrower meaning has to be assigned to it, namely, that of assigning\n\nsomeone to a post which would not include “transfer”. Quite apart from\n\nthe positioning of the word “posting” in between “appointment” and\n\n“promotion”, from which it took its colour, even otherwise, <a href=\"/doc/205445/\" id=\"a_90\">Articles 234</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1345754/\" id=\"a_91\">235</a> of the Constitution would make it clear that since “transfer” of District\n\nJudges is with the High Court and not with the State Government, quite\n\nobviously, the expression “posting” could not be used in its wider sense –\n\nsee pages 460 and 461.

This Court held:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">          “It remains, however, to consider whether by reason of the\n      fact that the words “other proceeding” stand opposed to the\n      words “a claim of set-off” any limitation in their meaning was\n      contemplated. It is on this aspect of the case that the learned\n      Judges have seriously differed. When in a statute particular\n      classes are mentioned by name and then are followed by\n      general words, the general words are sometimes construed\n      ejusdem generis i.e. limited to the same category or genus\n      comprehended by the particular words but it is not necessary\n      that this rule must always apply. The nature of the special\n      words and the general words must be considered before the\n      rule is applied. In Allen v. Emersons [(1944) IKB 362] Asquith,\n      J., gave interesting examples of particular words followed by\n      general words where the principle of ejusdem generis might or\n      might not apply. We think that the following illustration will\n      clear any difficulty. In the expression “books, pamphlets,\n      newspapers and other documents” private letters may not be\n      held included if “other documents” be interpreted ejusdem\n      generis with what goes before. But in a provision which reads\n      “newspapers or other document likely to convey secrets to the\n      enemy”, the words “other document” would include document\n      of any kind and would not take their colour from “newspapers”.\n      It follows, therefore, that interpretation ejusdem generis or\n      noscitur a sociis need not always be made when words\n      showing particular classes are followed by general words.\n      Before the general words can be so interpreted there must be\n      a genus constituted or a category disclosed with reference to\n      which the general words can and are intended to be restricted.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                                           18</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\f      Here the expression “claim of set-off” does not disclose a\n      category or a genus. Set-offs are of two kinds — legal and\n      equitable — and both are already comprehended and it is\n      difficult to think of any right “arising from a contract” which is of\n      the same nature as a claim of set-off and can be raised by a\n      defendant in a suit. Mr B.C. Misra, whom we invited to give us\n      examples, admitted frankly that it was impossible for him to\n      think of any proceeding of the nature of a claim of set-off other\n      than a claim of set-off which could be raised in a suit such as\n      is described in the second sub-section. In respect of the first\n      sub-section he could give only two examples. They are (i) a\n      claim by a pledger of goods-with an unregistered firm whose\n      good are attached and who has to make an objection under\n      <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_95\">Order 21 Rule 58 of the Code of Civil Procedure</a> and (ii)\n      proving a debt before a liquidator. The latter is not raised as a\n      defence and cannot belong to the same genus as a “claim of\n      set-off”. The former can be made to fit but by a stretch of\n      some considerable imagination. It is difficult for us to accept\n      that the legislature was thinking of such far-fetched things\n      when it spoke of “other proceeding” ejusdem generis with a\n      claim of set-off.”\n                                                         (at pages 56-57)\n\n         “In our judgment, the words “other proceeding” in sub-\n      section (3) must receive their full meaning untrammelled by\n      the words “a claim of set-off”. The latter words neither intend\n      nor can be construed to cut down the generality of the words\n      “other proceeding”. The sub-section provides for the\n      application of the provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) to\n      claims of set-off and also to other proceedings of any kind\n      which can properly be said to be for enforcement of any right\n      arising from contract except those expressly mentioned as\n      exceptions in sub-section (3) and sub-section (4).”\n                                                          (at page 60)\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"459864\" id=\"span_20\">17.

Where this\n            is lacking, the rule cannot apply, but the mention of\n            a single species does not constitute a genus\n            [Craies on Statute Law, 6th Edn, p 181].”\n         Maxwell in his book on ‘Interpretation of Statutes’ explained\n     the principle by saying: “But the general word which follows\n     particular and specific words of the same nature as itself takes\n     its meaning from them, and is presumed to be restricted to the\n     same genus as those words …. Unless there is a genus or\n     category, there is no room for the application of the ejusdem\n     generis doctrine [Maxwell on Interpretation of Statutes, 11th\n     Edn pp. 326, 327]”. In United Towns Electric Co., Ltd. v.\n     Attorney-General for Newfoundland [(1939) I AER 423] , the\n     Privy Council held that, in their opinion, there is no room for\n     the application of the principle of ejusdem generis in the\n     absence of any mention of a genus, since the mention of a\n     single species — for example, water rates — does not\n     constitute a genus. In <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 12</a> of the Constitution, the bodies\n     specifically named are the Executive Governments of the\n     Union and the States, the Legislatures of the Union and the\n     States, and local authorities.

A very useful index is\n      provided in the Section by defining the words “corresponding\n      court, tribunal, authority or officer in the State of Jharkhand”\n      as this: [<a href=\"/doc/160390489/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 89(3)(b)(i)</a>]\n             “The court, tribunal, authority or officer in which, or\n             before whom, the proceeding would have laid if it\n             had been instituted after the appointed day;”\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">      28. Look at the words “would have laid if it had been instituted\n      after the appointed day”. In considering the question as to\n      where the proceeding relating to the 36 cases involved in\n      these appeals would have laid, had they been instituted after\n      the appointed day, we have absolutely no doubt that the\n      meaning of the word “exclusively” should be understood as\n      “substantially all or for the greater part or principally”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">      29. We cannot overlook the main object of <a href=\"/doc/1147393/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 89</a> of the\n      Act. It must not be forgotten that transfer of criminal cases is\n      not the only subject covered by the Section. The provision\n      seeks to allocate the files or records relating to all\n      proceedings, after the bifurcation if they were to be instituted\n      after the appointed day. Any interpretation should be one\n      which achieves that object and not that which might create\n      confusion or perplexity or even bewilderment to the officers of\n      the respective States. In other words, the interpretation should\n      be made with pragmatism, not pedantically or in a stilted\n      manner. For the purpose of criminal cases, we should bear in\n      mind the subject-matter of the case to be transferred. When\n      so considering, we have to take into account further that all\n      the 36 cases are primarily for the offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_109\">PC Act</a>\n      and hence they are all triable before the Courts of Special\n      Judges.

This principle of interpretation known as\n      “noscitur a sociis” has received approval in Rainbow Steels\n      Ltd. v.

It is only\n            where the intention of the legislature in associating\n            wider words with words of narrower significance is\n            doubtful, or otherwise not clear that the present rule\n            of construction can be usefully applied.

But\n        where there is, as here, a term of wide denotation which is not\n        free from ambiguity, the addition of the words such as\n        “including” is sufficiently indicative of the societas. As we have\n        said, the word “includes” in the present context indicates a\n        commonality or shared features or attributes of the including\n        word with the included.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">        xxx xxx xxx\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">        83.

In this regard, we may refer to\na passage from Justice G.P.

It applies when two or\n   more words are susceptible of analogous\n   meanings are coupled together, to be read and\n   understood in their cognate sense. [G.P.

Importantly, where a residuary phrase is\n\nused as a catch-all expression to take within its scope what may\n\nreasonably be comprehended by a provision, regard being had to its\n\nobject and setting, noscitur a sociis cannot be used to colour an otherwise\n\nwide expression so as to whittle it down and stultify the object of a\n\nstatutory provision.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">\nOBJECT OF SECTION 14 OF THE IBC\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">23.

Paragraphs 8.2 and 8.11 thereof\n\nread as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">     “8.2. The moratorium under <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 14</a> is intended to keep the\n     corporate debtor’s assets together during the insolvency\n     resolution process and facilitating orderly completion of the\n     processes envisaged during the insolvency resolution process\n     and ensuring that the company may continue as a going\n     concern while the creditors take a view on resolution of\n     default. Keeping the corporate debtor running as a going\n     concern during the CIRP helps in achieving resolution as a\n     going concern as well, which is likely to maximize value for all\n     stakeholders. In other jurisdictions too, a moratorium may be\n     put in place on the advent of formal insolvency proceedings,\n     including liquidation and reorganization proceedings. The\n     UNCITRAL Guide notes that a moratorium is critical during\n     reorganization proceedings since it facilitates the continued\n     operation of the business and allows the debtor a breathing\n     space to organize its affairs, time for preparation and approval\n     of a reorganization plan and for other steps such as shedding\n     unprofitable activities and onerous contracts, where\n     appropriate.”\n     xxx xxx xxx\n     “8.11. Further, the purpose of the moratorium is to keep the\n     assets of the debtor together for successful insolvency\n     resolution, and it does not bar all actions, especially where\n     countervailing public policy concerns are involved. For\n     instance, criminal proceedings are not considered to be\n     barred by the moratorium, since they do not constitute “money\n     claims or recovery” proceedings. In this regard, the Committee\n     also noted that in some jurisdictions, laws allow regulatory\n     claims, such as those which are not designed to collect money\n     for the estate but to protect vital and urgent public interests,\n     restraining activities causing environmental damage or\n     activities that are detrimental to public health and safety to be\n     continued during the moratorium period.”\n\nIt can be seen that paragraph 8.11 refers to the very judgment under\n\nappeal before us, and cannot therefore be said to throw any light on the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                                                         34</span>\n\fcorrect position in law which has only to be finally settled by this Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"17372683\" id=\"span_56\">However, paragraph 8.2 is important in that the object of a moratorium\n\nprovision such as <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 14</a> is to see that there is no depletion of a\n\ncorporate debtor’s assets during the insolvency resolution process so that\n\nit can be kept running as a going concern during this time, thus\n\nmaximising value for all stakeholders. The idea is that it facilitates the\n\ncontinued operation of the business of the corporate debtor to allow it\n\nbreathing space to organise its affairs so that a new management may\n\nultimately take over and bring the corporate debtor out of financial\n\nsickness, thus benefitting all stakeholders, which would include workmen\n\nof the corporate debtor. Also, the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/17372683/\" id=\"a_146\">Swiss\n\nRibbons (P) Ltd. v. Union of India</a>, (2019) 4 SCC 17 states the raison\n\nd’être for <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 14</a> in paragraph 28 as follows:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">     “28. It can thus be seen that the primary focus of the\n     legislation is to ensure revival and continuation of the\n     corporate debtor by protecting the corporate debtor from its\n     own management and from a corporate death by liquidation.\n     The Code is thus a beneficial legislation which puts the\n     corporate debtor back on its feet, not being a mere recovery\n     legislation for creditors. The interests of the corporate debtor\n     have, therefore, been bifurcated and separated from that of its\n     promoters/those who are in management. Thus, the resolution\n     process is not adversarial to the corporate debtor but, in fact,\n     protective of its interests. The moratorium imposed by <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_148\">Section\n     14</a> is in the interest of the corporate debtor itself, thereby\n     preserving the assets of the corporate debtor during the\n     resolution process. The timelines within which the resolution\n     process is to take place again protects the corporate debtor&#x27;s\n     assets from further dilution, and also protects all its creditors\n     and workers by seeing that the resolution process goes\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                                                         35</span>\n\f      through as fast as possible so that another management can,\n      through its entrepreneurial skills, resuscitate the corporate\n      debtor to achieve all these ends.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">24.   It can thus be seen that regard being had to the object sought to be\n\nachieved by the IBC in imposing this moratorium, a quasi-criminal\n\nproceeding which would result in the assets of the corporate debtor being\n\ndepleted as a result of having to pay compensation which can amount to\n\ntwice the amount of the cheque that has bounced would directly impact\n\nthe corporate insolvency resolution process in the same manner as the\n\ninstitution, continuation, or execution of a decree in such suit in a civil\n\ncourt for the amount of debt or other liability. Judged from the point of\n\nview of this objective, it is impossible to discern any difference between\n\nthe impact of a suit and a <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 138</a> proceeding, insofar as the\n\ncorporate debtor is concerned, on its getting the necessary breathing\n\nspace to get back on its feet during the corporate insolvency resolution\n\nprocess. Given this fact, it is difficult to accept that noscitur a sociis or\n\nejusdem generis should be used to cut down the width of the expression\n\n“proceedings” so as to make such proceedings analogous to civil suits.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">25.   Viewed from another point of view, clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 14(1)</a> also\n\nmakes it clear that during the moratorium period, any transfer,\n\nencumbrance, alienation, or disposal by the corporate debtor of any of its\n\nassets or any legal right or beneficial interest therein being also\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                                                           36</span>\n\finterdicted, yet a liability in the form of compensation payable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 138</a> would somehow escape the dragnet of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 14(1)</a>. While\n\n<a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 14(1)(a)</a> refers to monetary liabilities of the corporate debtor,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 14(1)(b)</a> refers to the corporate debtor’s assets, and together,\n\nthese two clauses form a scheme which shields the corporate debtor from\n\npecuniary attacks against it in the moratorium period so that the corporate\n\ndebtor gets breathing space to continue as a going concern in order to\n\nultimately rehabilitate itself. Any crack in this shield is bound to have\n\nadverse consequences, given the object of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 14</a>, and cannot, by\n\nany process of interpretation, be allowed to occur.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">SECTION 14 IN RELATION TO OTHER MORATORIUM SECTIONS IN\nTHE IBC\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">26.

When an\n      application is filed under Part III, an interim-moratorium or a\n      moratorium is applicable in respect of any debt due. First and\n      foremost, this is a separate moratorium, applicable separately\n      in the case of personal guarantors against whom insolvency\n      resolution processes may be initiated under Part III. Secondly,\n      the protection of the moratorium under these Sections is far\n      greater than that of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_199\">Section 14</a> in that pending legal\n      proceedings in respect of the debt and not the debtor are\n      stayed.

The\n      object of the Code is not to allow such guarantors to escape\n      from an independent and co-extensive liability to pay off the\n      entire outstanding debt, which is why <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_203\">Section 14</a> is not applied\n      to them. However, insofar as firms and individuals are\n      concerned, guarantees are given in respect of individual debts\n      by persons who have unlimited liability to pay them. And such\n      guarantors may be complete strangers to the debtor — often it\n      could be a personal friend. It is for this reason that the\n      moratorium mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/980766/\" id=\"a_204\">Section 101</a> would cover such\n      persons, as such moratorium is in relation to the debt and not\n      the debtor.”\n\nThese observations, when viewed in context, are correct. However, this\n\ncase is distinguishable in that the difference between these provisions\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_205\">Section 14</a> was not examined qua moratorium provisions as a whole\n\nin relation to corporate debtors vis-à-vis individuals/firms.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                                                           43</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">\fTHE INTERPLAY BETWEEN SECTION 14 AND SECTION 32A OF THE\nIBC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">30.

The raison d’être for the enactment of Section 32A has been stated\n\nby the Report of the Insolvency Law Committee of February, 2020, which\n\nis as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">      “17. LIABILITY OF CORPORATE DEBTOR FOR OFFENCES\n      COMMITTED PRIOR TO INITIATION OF CIRP\n      17.1. <a href=\"/doc/1269397/\" id=\"a_213\">Section 17</a> of the Code provides that on commencement\n      of the CIRP, the powers of management of the corporate\n      debtor vest with the interim resolution professional. Further,\n      the powers of the Board of Directors or partners of the\n      corporate debtor stand suspended, and are to be exercised by\n      the interim resolution professional. Thereafter, Section 29A,\n      read with <a href=\"/doc/1036533/\" id=\"a_214\">Section 35(1)(f)</a>, places restrictions on related\n      parties of the corporate debtor from proposing a resolution\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                                                           45</span>\n\fplan and purchasing the property of the corporate debtor in\nthe CIRP and liquidation process, respectively. Thus, in most\ncases, the provisions of the Code effectuate a change in\ncontrol of the corporate debtor that results in a clean break of\nthe corporate debtor from its erstwhile management. However,\nthe legal form of the corporate debtor continues in the CIRP,\nand may be preserved in the resolution plan. Additionally,\nwhile the property of the corporate debtor may also change\nhands upon resolution or liquidation, such property also\ncontinues to exist, either as property of the corporate debtor,\nor in the hands of the purchaser.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">17.2. However, even after commencement of CIRP or after its\nsuccessful resolution or liquidation, the corporate debtor,\nalong with its property, would be susceptible to investigations\nor proceedings related to criminal offences committed by it\nprior to the commencement of a CIRP, leading to the\nimposition of certain liabilities and restrictions on the corporate\ndebtor and its properties even after they were lawfully\nacquired by a resolution applicant or a successful bidder,\nrespectively.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">Liability where a Resolution Plan has been Approved\n17.3. It was brought to the Committee that this had created\napprehension amongst potential resolution applicants, who did\nnot want to take on the liability for any offences committed\nprior to commencement of CIRP. In one case, JSW Steel had\nspecifically sought certain reliefs and concessions, within an\nannexure to the resolution plan it had submitted for approval\nof the Adjudicating Authority. Without relief from imposition of\nthe such liability, the Committee noted that in the long run,\npotential resolution applicants could be disincentivised from\nproposing a resolution plan. The Committee was also\nconcerned that resolution plans could be priced lower on an\naverage, even where the corporate debtor did not commit any\noffence and was not subject to investigation, due to adverse\nselection by resolution applicants who might be apprehensive\nthat they might be held liable for offences that they have not\nbeen able to detect due to information asymmetry. Thus, the\nthreat of liability falling on bona fide persons who acquire the\nlegal entity, could substantially lower the chances of its\nsuccessful takeover by potential resolution applicants.\n17.4. This could have substantially hampered the Code’s goal\nof value maximisation, and lowered recoveries to creditors,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                                                      46</span>\n\fincluding financial institutions who take recourse to the Code\nfor resolution of the NPAs on their balance sheet. At the same\ntime, the Committee was also conscious that authorities are\nduty bound to penalise the commission of any offence,\nespecially in cases involving substantial public interest. Thus,\ntwo competing concerns need to be balanced.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">xxx xxx xxx\n17.6. Given this, the Committee felt that a distinction must be\ndrawn between the corporate debtor which may have\ncommitted offences under the control of its previous\nmanagement, prior to the CIRP, and the corporate debtor that\nis resolved, and taken over by an unconnected resolution\napplicant. While the corporate debtor’s actions prior to the\ncommencement of the CIRP must be investigated and\npenalised, the liability must be affixed only upon those who\nwere responsible for the corporate debtor’s actions in this\nperiod. However, the new management of the corporate\ndebtor, which has nothing to do with such past offences,\nshould not be penalised for the actions of the erstwhile\nmanagement of the corporate debtor, unless they themselves\nwere involved in the commission of the offence, or were\nrelated parties, promoters or other persons in management\nand control of the corporate debtor at the time of or any time\nfollowing the commission of the offence, and could acquire the\ncorporate debtor, notwithstanding the prohibition under\nSection 29A.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">17.7. Thus, the Committee agreed that a new Section should\nbe inserted to provide that where the corporate debtor is\nsuccessfully resolved, it should not be held liable for any\noffence committed prior to the commencement of the CIRP,\nunless the successful resolution applicant was also involved in\nthe commission of the offence, or was a related party,\npromoter or other person in management and control of the\ncorporate debtor at the time of or any time following the\ncommission of the offence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">17.8. Notwithstanding this, those persons who were\nresponsible to the corporate debtor for the conduct of its\nbusiness at the time of the commission of such offence,\nshould continue to be liable for such an offence, vicariously or\notherwise, regardless of the fact that the corporate debtor’s\nliability has ceased.”\n                                            (emphasis supplied)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                                                   47</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"54883247\" id=\"span_71\">32.   This Court, in <a href=\"/doc/54883247/\" id=\"a_215\">Manish Kumar v. Union of India</a>, 2021 SCC OnLine\n\nSC 30, upheld the constitutional validity of this provision. This Court\n\nobserved:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">      “280. We are of the clear view that no case whatsoever is\n      made out to seek invalidation of Section 32A. The boundaries\n      of this Court&#x27;s jurisdiction are clear. The wisdom of the\n      legislation is not open to judicial review. Having regard to the\n      object of the Code, the experience of the working of the code,\n      the interests of all stakeholders including most importantly the\n      imperative need to attract resolution applicants who would not\n      shy away from offering reasonable and fair value as part of\n      the resolution plan if the legislature thought that immunity be\n      granted to the corporate debtor as also its property, it hardly\n      furnishes a ground for this this Court to interfere. The\n      provision is carefully thought out. It is not as if the wrongdoers\n      are allowed to get away. They remain liable. The\n      extinguishment of the criminal liability of the corporate debtor\n      is apparently important to the new management to make a\n      clean break with the past and start on a clean slate. We must\n      also not overlook the principle that the impugned provision is\n      part of an economic measure. The reverence courts justifiably\n      hold such laws in cannot but be applicable in the instant case\n      as well. The provision deals with reference to offences\n      committed prior to the commencement of the CIRP. With the\n      admission of the application the management of the corporate\n      debtor passes into the hands of the Interim Resolution\n      Professional and thereafter into the hands of the Resolution\n      Professional subject undoubtedly to the control by the\n      Committee of Creditors. As far as protection afforded to the\n      property is concerned there is clearly a rationale behind it.\n      Having regard to the object of the statute we hardly see any\n      manifest arbitrariness in the provision.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">33.   Section 32A cannot possibly be said to throw any light on the true\n\ninterpretation of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_216\">Section 14(1)(a)</a> as the reason for introducing Section\n\n32A had nothing whatsoever to do with any moratorium provision. At the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                                                           48</span>\n\fheart of the Section is the extinguishment of criminal liability of the\n\ncorporate debtor, from the date the resolution plan has been approved by\n\nthe Adjudicating Authority, so that the new management may make a\n\nclean break with the past and start on a clean slate. A moratorium\n\nprovision, on the other hand, does not extinguish any liability, civil or\n\ncriminal, but only casts a shadow on proceedings already initiated and on\n\nproceedings to be initiated, which shadow is lifted when the moratorium\n\nperiod comes to an end. Also, Section 32A(1) operates only after the\n\nmoratorium comes to an end. At the heart of Section 32A is the IBC’s goal\n\nof value maximisation and the need to obviate lower recoveries to\n\ncreditors as a result of the corporate debtor continuing to be exposed to\n\ncriminal liability. Unfortunately, the Section is inelegantly drafted. The\n\nsecond proviso to Section 32A(1) speaks of persons who are in any\n\nmanner in charge of, or responsible to the corporate debtor for the\n\nconduct of its business or associated with the corporate debtor and who\n\nare, directly or indirectly, involved in the commission of “such offence”,\n\ni.e., the offence referred to in sub-section (1), “as per the report submitted\n\nor complaint filed by the investigating authority …”. The report submitted\n\nhere refers to a police report under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_217\">Section 173</a> of the CrPC, and\n\ncomplaints filed by investigating authorities under special Acts, as\n\nopposed to private complaints. If the language of the second proviso is\n\ntaken to interpret the language of Section 32A(1) in that the “offence\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                                                            49</span>\n\fcommitted” under Section 32A(1) would not include offences based upon\n\ncomplaints under <a href=\"/doc/255245/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 2(d)</a> of the CrPC, the width of the language\n\nwould be cut down and the object of Section 32A(1) would not be\n\nachieved as all prosecutions emanating from private complaints would be\n\nexcluded. Obviously, Section 32A(1) cannot be read in this fashion and\n\nclearly incudes the liability of the corporate debtor for all offences\n\ncommitted prior to the commencement of the corporate insolvency\n\nresolution process. Doubtless, a <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_219\">Section 138</a> proceeding would be\n\nincluded, and would, after the moratorium period comes to an end with a\n\nresolution plan by a new management being approved by the Adjudicating\n\nAuthority, cease to be an offence qua the corporate debtor.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">34.   A section which has been introduced by an amendment into an Act\n\nwith its focus on cesser of liability for offences committed by the corporate\n\ndebtor prior to the commencement of the corporate insolvency resolution\n\nprocess cannot be so construed so as to limit, by a sidewind as it were,\n\nthe moratorium provision contained in <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_220\">Section 14</a>, with which it is not at all\n\nconcerned. If the first proviso to Section 32A(1) is read in the manner\n\nsuggested by Shri Mehta, it will impact <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_221\">Section 14</a> by taking out of its ken\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 138</a>/<a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_223\">141</a> proceedings, which is not the object of Section 32A(1) at\n\nall. Assuming, therefore, that there is a clash between <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_224\">Section 14</a> of the\n\nIBC and the first proviso of Section 32A(1), this clash is best resolved by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                                                           50</span>\n\fapplying the doctrine of harmonious construction so that the objects of\n\nboth the provisions get subserved in the process, without damaging or\n\nlimiting one provision at the expense of the other. If, therefore, the\n\nexpression “prosecution” in the first proviso of Section 32A(1) refers to\n\ncriminal proceedings properly so-called either through the medium of a\n\nFirst Information Report or complaint filed by an investigating authority or\n\ncomplaint and not to quasi-criminal proceedings that are instituted under\n\nSections 138/141 of the Negotiable Instruments Act against the corporate\n\ndebtor, the object of Section 14(1) of the IBC gets subserved, as does\n\nthe object of Section 32A, which does away with criminal prosecutions in\n\nall cases against the corporate debtor, thus absolving the corporate\n\ndebtor from the same after a new management comes in.\n\n\nTHE NATURE OF PROCEEDINGS UNDER CHAPTER XVII OF THE\nNEGOTIABLE INSTRUMENTS ACT\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">35.

The deeming provision is important in that the legislature is cognizant\n\nof the fact that what is otherwise a civil liability is now also deemed to be\n\nan offence, since this liability is made punishable by law. It is important to\n\nnote that the transaction spoken of is a commercial transaction between\n\ntwo parties which involves payment of money for a debt or liability.

Thus, a debt or other\n\nliability barred by the law of limitation would be outside the scope of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_231\">Section 138</a>. This, coupled with fine that may extend to twice the amount\n\nof the cheque that is payable as compensation to the aggrieved party to\n\ncover both the amount of the cheque and the interest and costs\n\nthereupon, would show that it is really a hybrid provision to enforce\n\npayment under a bounced cheque if it is otherwise enforceable in civil\n\nlaw. Further, though the ingredients of the offence are contained in the\n\nfirst part of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_232\">Section 138</a> when the cheque is returned by the bank unpaid\n\nfor the reasons given in the Section, the proviso gives an opportunity to\n\nthe drawer of the cheque, stating that the drawer must fail to make\n\npayment of the amount within 15 days of the receipt of a notice, again\n\nmaking it clear that the real object of the provision is not to penalise the\n\nwrongdoer for an offence that is already made out, but to compensate the\n\nvictim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">37.

Chapter XIII of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_265\">CrPC</a>, consisting of Sections 177 to 189, is a chapter dealing with the\n\njurisdiction of the criminal courts in inquiries and trials.    When the\n\njurisdiction of a criminal court is spoken of by these Sections, the\n\nexpression “cause of action” is conspicuous by its absence.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">41.   By an Amendment Act of 2002, various other sections were added\n\nto this Chapter.

This provision is again an\n\nimportant pointer to the fact that the payment of compensation is at the\n\nheart of the provision in that a fine exceeding INR 5000/-, the sky being\n\nthe limit, can be imposed by way of a summary trial which, after\n\napplication of <a href=\"/doc/1705664/\" id=\"a_267\">Section 357</a> of the CrPC, results in compensating the victim\n\nup to twice the amount of the bounced cheque.

The\nexpression in our judgment covers all proceedings in which a\nparty asserts the existence of a civil right conferred by the civil\nlaw or by statute, and claims relief for breach thereof. A\ncriminal proceeding on the other hand is ordinarily one in\nwhich if carried to its conclusion it may result in the imposition\nof sentences such as death, imprisonment, fine or forfeiture of\nproperty. It also includes proceedings in which in the larger\ninterest of the State, orders to prevent apprehended breach of\nthe peace, orders to bind down persons who are a danger to\nthe maintenance of peace and order, or orders aimed at\npreventing vagrancy are contemplated to be passed. But the\nwhole area of proceedings, which reach the High Courts is not\nexhausted by classifying the proceedings as civil and criminal.\nThere are certain proceedings which may be regarded as\nneither civil nor criminal. For instance, proceeding for\ncontempt of court, and for exercise of disciplinary jurisdiction\nagainst lawyers or other professionals, such as Chartered\nAccountants may not fall within the classification of\nproceedings, civil or criminal. But there is no warrant for the\nview that from the category of civil proceedings, it was\nintended to exclude proceedings relating to or which seek\nrelief against enforcement of taxation laws of the State. The\nprimary object of a taxation statute is to collect revenue for the\ngovernance of the State or for providing specific services and\nsuch laws directly affect the civil rights of the tax-payer. If a\nperson is called upon to pay tax which the State is not\ncompetent to levy, or which is not imposed in accordance with\nthe law which permits imposition of the tax, or in the levy,\nassessment and collection of which rights of the tax-payer are\ninfringed in a manner not warranted by the statute, a\nproceeding to obtain relief whether it is from the tribunal set up\nby the taxing statute, or from the civil court would be regarded\nas a civil proceeding. The character of the proceeding, in our\njudgment, depends not upon the nature of the tribunal which is\ninvested with authority to grant relief, but upon the nature of\nthe right violated and the appropriate relief which may be\nclaimed. A civil proceeding is, therefore, one in which a person\nseeks to enforce by appropriate relief the alleged infringement\nof his civil rights against another person or the State, and\nwhich if the claim is proved would result in the declaration\nexpress or implied of the right claimed and relief such as\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                                                      60</span>\n\fpayment of debt, damages, compensation, delivery of specific\nproperty, enforcement of personal rights, determination of\nstatus etc.”\n                                        (at pages 196-197)\n\n        “A large number of cases have arisen before the High\nCourts in India in which conflicting views about the meaning of\nthe expression “civil proceeding” were pressed. In some cases\nit was held that the expression “civil proceeding” excludes a\nproceeding instituted in the High Court for the issue of a writ\nwhatever may be the nature of the right infringed and the relief\nclaimed in other cases it has been held that a proceeding\nresulting from an application for a writ under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_285\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution may in certain cases be deemed to be a “civil\nproceeding”, if the claim made, the right infringed and the\nrelief sought warrant that inference: in still another set of\ncases it has been held that even if a proceeding commenced\nby a petition for a writ be generally categorised as a civil\nproceeding, where the jurisdiction which the High Court\nexercises relates to revenue, the proceeding is not civil. A\nperusal of the reasons given in the cases prompt the following\nobservations. There are two preliminary conditions to the\nexercise of the power to grant certificate: (a) there must be a\njudgment, decree or final order, and that judgment, decree or\nfinal order must be made in a civil proceeding. An advisory\nopinion in a tax reference may not be appealed from with\ncertificate under <a href=\"/doc/1325025/\" id=\"a_286\">Article 133</a> because the opinion is not a\njudgment, decree or final order, and (b) a proceeding does not\ncease to be civil, when relief is claimed for enforcement of civil\nrights merely because the proceeding is not tried as a civil\nsuit. In a large majority of the cases in which the jurisdiction of\nthe High Court to certify a case under <a href=\"/doc/1011888/\" id=\"a_287\">Article 133(1)</a> was\nnegatived it appears to have been assumed that the\nexpression “other proceeding” used in <a href=\"/doc/783690/\" id=\"a_288\">Article 132</a> of the\nConstitution is or includes a proceeding of the nature of a\nrevenue proceeding, and therefore the expression “civil\nproceeding” in <a href=\"/doc/1011888/\" id=\"a_289\">Article 133(1)</a> does not include a revenue\nproceeding. This assumption for reasons already set out is\nerroneous.”\n                                                    (at page 199)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                                                      61</span>\n\fA perusal of this judgment would show that a civil proceeding is not\n\nnecessarily a proceeding which begins with the filing of a suit and\n\nculminates in execution of a decree.

This chapter was\n      introduced in the Act by the Banking, Public Financial\n      Institutions and Negotiable Instruments Laws (Amendment)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                                                               62</span>\n\fAct, 1988 (Act 66 of 1988) with the object of inculcating faith in\nthe efficacy of banking operations and giving credibility to\nnegotiable instruments in business transactions and in order\nto promote efficacy of banking operations. With the policy of\nliberalisation adopted by the country which brought about\nincrease in international trade and commerce, it became\nnecessary to inculcate faith in banking. World trade is carried\nthrough banking operations rather than cash transactions. The\namendment was intended to create an atmosphere of faith\nand reliance on banking system. Therefore, while considering\nthe question of applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_298\">Section 138</a> of the Act to a\nsituation presented by the facts of the present case, it is\nnecessary to keep the objects of the legislation in mind. If a\nparty is allowed to use a cheque as a mode of deferred\npayment and the payee of the cheque on the faith that he will\nget his payment on the due date accepts such deferred\npayment by way of cheque, he should not normally suffer on\naccount of non-payment. The faith, which the legislature has\ndesired that such instruments should inspire in commercial\ntransactions would be completely lost if parties are as a matter\nof routine allowed to interdict payment by issuing instruction to\nbanks to stop payment of cheques. In today&#x27;s world where use\nof cash in day-to-day life is almost getting extinct and people\nare using negotiable instruments in commercial transactions\nand plastic money for their daily needs as consumers, it is all\nthe more necessary that people&#x27;s faith in such instruments\nshould be strengthened rather than weakened. Provisions\ncontained in <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_299\">Sections 138</a> to <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_300\">142</a> of the Act are intended to\ndiscourage people from not honouring their commitments by\nway of payment through cheques. It is desirable that the court\nshould lean in favour of an interpretation which serves the\nobject of the statute. The penal provisions contained in\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_301\">Sections 138</a> to <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_302\">142</a> of the Act are intended to ensure that\nobligations undertaken by issuing cheques as a mode of\npayment are honoured. A post-dated cheque will lose its\ncredibility and acceptability if its payment can be stopped\nroutinely. A cheque is a well-recognized mode of payment and\npost-dated cheques are often used in various transactions in\ndaily life. The purpose of a post-dated cheque is to provide\nsome accommodation to the drawer of the cheque. Therefore,\nit is all the more necessary that the drawer of the cheque\nshould not be allowed to abuse the accommodation given to\nhim by a creditor by way of acceptance of a post-dated\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                                                     63</span>\n\f      cheque. If stoppage of payment of a post-dated cheque is\n      permitted to take the case out of the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_303\">Section 138</a> of\n      the Act, it will amount to allowing the party to take advantage\n      of his own wrong.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">45.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1981864\" id=\"span_90\">In <a href=\"/doc/1981864/\" id=\"a_304\">Vinay Devanna Nayak v.

Compounding as codified in Section 320 of the Code has\n      a historical background. In common law compounding was\n      considered a misdemeanour. In Kenny’s Outlines of Criminal\n      Law (19th Edn., 1966) the concept of compounding has been\n      traced as follows: (p. 407, para 422)\n            “422. Mercy should be shown, not sold.—It is a\n            misdemeanour at common law to ‘compound’ a\n            felony (and perhaps also to compound a\n            misdemeanour); i.e. to bargain, for value, to\n            abstain from prosecuting the offender who has\n            committed a crime. You commit this offence if you\n            promise a thief not to prosecute him if only he will\n            return the goods he stole from you; but you may\n            lawfully take them back if you make no such\n            promise. You may show mercy, but must not sell\n            mercy. This offence of compounding is committed\n            by the bare act of agreement; even though the\n            compounder afterwards breaks his agreement and\n            prosecutes the criminal.

In our country also when the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_338\">Criminal Procedure Code</a>,\n1861 was enacted it was silent about the compounding of\noffence. Subsequently, when the next Code of 1872 was\nintroduced it mentioned about compounding in Section 188 by\nproviding the mode of compounding. However, it did not\ncontain any provision declaring what offences were\ncompoundable. The decision as to what offences were\ncompoundable was governed by reference to the exception to\nSection 214 of the Penal Code. The subsequent Code of 1898\nprovided Section 345 indicating the offences which were\ncompoundable but the said section was only made applicable\nto compounding of offences defined and permissible under the\nPenal code.

It is sometimes said that cases arising\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_357\">Section 138</a> of the Act are really civil cases\nmasquerading as criminal cases. The avowed object of\n<a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_358\">Chapter XVII of the Act</a> is to “encourage the culture of use of\ncheques and enhance the credibility of the instrument”. In\neffect, its object appears to be both punitive as also\ncompensatory and restitutive, in regard to cheque dishonour\ncases. <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_359\">Chapter XVII of the Act</a> is a unique exercise which\nblurs the dividing line between civil and criminal jurisdictions. It\nprovides a single forum and single proceeding, for\nenforcement of criminal liability (for dishonouring the cheque)\nand for enforcement of the civil liability (for realisation of the\ncheque amount) thereby obviating the need for the creditor to\nmove two different fora for relief. This is evident from the\nfollowing provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_360\">Chapter XVII of the Act</a>:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">  (i) The provision for levy of fine which is linked to the\n        cheque amount and may extend to twice the\n        amount of the cheque (<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_361\">Section 138</a>) thereby\n        rendering Section 357(3) virtually infructuous\n        insofar as cheque dishonour cases are concerned.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">  (ii) The provision enabling a First Class Magistrate to\n        levy fine exceeding Rs 5000 (<a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_362\">Section 143</a>)\n        notwithstanding the ceiling to the fine, as Rs 5000\n        imposed by <a href=\"/doc/1339321/\" id=\"a_363\">Section 29(2)</a> of the Code.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">  (iii) The provision relating to mode of service of\n        summons (<a href=\"/doc/24813438/\" id=\"a_364\">Section 144</a>) as contrasted from the\n        mode prescribed for criminal cases in <a href=\"/doc/1546841/\" id=\"a_365\">Section 62</a>\n        of the Code.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">  (iv) The provision for taking evidence of the\n        complainant by affidavit (<a href=\"/doc/138755618/\" id=\"a_366\">Section 145</a>) which is\n        more prevalent in civil proceedings, as contrasted\n        from the procedure for recording evidence in the\n        Code.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">  (v) The provision making all offences punishable\n        under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_367\">Section 138</a> of the Act compoundable.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_98\">17. The apparent intention is to ensure that not only the\noffender is punished, but also ensure that the complainant\ninvariably receives the amount of the cheque by way of\ncompensation under Section 357(1)(b) of the Code.

This is\n      because of the provision enabling the court to levy a fine\n      linked to the cheque amount and the usual direction in such\n      cases is for payment as compensation, the cheque amount,\n      as loss incurred by the complainant on account of dishonour\n      of cheque, under Section 357(1)(b) of the Code and the\n      provision for compounding the offences under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_370\">Section 138</a> of\n      the Act. Most of the cases (except those where liability is\n      denied) get compounded at one stage or the other by\n      payment of the cheque amount with or without interest. Even\n      where the offence is not compounded, the courts tend to\n      direct payment of compensation equal to the cheque amount\n      (or even something more towards interest) by levying a fine\n      commensurate with the cheque amount. A stage has reached\n      when most of the complainants, in particular the financing\n      institutions (particularly private financiers) view the\n      proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_371\">Section 138</a> of the Act, as a proceeding for\n      the recovery of the cheque amount, the punishment of the\n      drawer of the cheque for the offence of dishonour, becoming\n      secondary.”\n                                                    (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">49.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"100995424\" id=\"span_106\">In <a href=\"/doc/100995424/\" id=\"a_372\">Dashrath Rupsingh Rathod v.

We have undertaken this succinct study mindful of the\n     fact that Parliamentary debates have a limited part to play in\n     interpretation of statutes, the presumption being that\n     legislators have the experience, expertise and language skills\n     to draft laws which unambiguously convey their intentions and\n     expectations for the enactments. What is palpably clear is that\n     Parliament was aware that they were converting civil liability\n     into criminal content inter alia by the deeming fiction of\n     culpability in terms of the pandect comprising <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_374\">Section 138</a> and\n     the succeeding sections, which severely curtail defences to\n     prosecution. Parliament was also aware that the offence of\n     cheating, etc. already envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_375\">IPC</a>, continued to be\n     available.”\n     xxx xxx xxx\n     “17. The marginal note of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_376\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act explicitly\n     defines the offence as being the dishonour of cheques for\n     insufficiency, etc. of funds in the account. Of course, the\n     headings, captions or opening words of a piece of legislation\n     are normally not strictly or comprehensively determinative of\n     the sweep of the actual Section itself, but it does presage its\n     intendment. See <a href=\"/doc/231567/\" id=\"a_377\">Frick India Ltd. v.

None of the\n     provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_379\">IPC</a> have been rendered nugatory by <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_380\">Section\n     138</a> of the NI Act and both operate on their own. It is trite that\n     mens rea is the quintessential of every crime. The objective of\n     Parliament was to strengthen the use of cheques, distinct from\n     other negotiable instruments, as mercantile tender and\n     therefore it became essential for <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_381\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act\n     offence to be freed from the requirement of proving mens rea.</span></span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_100\">     This has been achieved by deeming the commission of an\n     offence dehors mens rea not only under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_382\">Section 138</a> but also\n     by virtue of the succeeding two sections. <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_383\">Section 139</a> carves\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                                                         73</span>\n\f      out the presumption that the holder of a cheque has received\n      it for the discharge of any liability. <a href=\"/doc/1685033/\" id=\"a_384\">Section 140</a> clarifies that it\n      will not be available as a defence to the drawer that he had no\n      reason to believe, when he issued the cheque, that it would be\n      dishonoured. <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_385\">Section 138</a> unequivocally states that the\n      offence is committed no sooner the drawee bank returns the\n      cheque unpaid.”\n\nThe focus in this case was on the court within whose jurisdiction the\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_386\">Section 138</a> can be said to have taken place.

Offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_412\">Section 138</a> of the Act is primarily a civil\n     wrong. Burden of proof is on the accused in view of\n     presumption under <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_413\">Section 139</a> but the standard of such proof\n     is “preponderance of probabilities”. The same has to be\n     normally tried summarily as per provisions of summary trial\n     under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_414\">CrPC</a> but with such variation as may be appropriate to\n     proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_415\">Chapter XVII of the Act</a>. Thus read,\n     principle of <a href=\"/doc/729109/\" id=\"a_416\">Section 258</a> CrPC will apply and the court can\n     close the proceedings and discharge the accused on\n     satisfaction that the cheque amount with assessed costs and\n     interest is paid and if there is no reason to proceed with the\n     punitive aspect.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_163\">     18.2. The object of the provision being primarily\n     compensatory, punitive element being mainly with the object\n     of enforcing the compensatory element, compounding at the\n     initial stage has to be encouraged but is not debarred at later\n     stage subject to appropriate compensation as may be found\n     acceptable to the parties or the court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\">     18.3. Though compounding requires consent of both parties,\n     even in absence of such consent, the court, in the interests of\n     justice, on being satisfied that the complainant has been duly\n     compensated, can in its discretion close the proceedings and\n     discharge the accused.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">     18.4. Procedure for trial of cases under <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_417\">Chapter XVII of the\n     Act</a> has normally to be summary. The discretion of the\n     Magistrate under second proviso to <a href=\"/doc/45362031/\" id=\"a_418\">Section 143</a>, to hold that it\n     was undesirable to try the case summarily as sentence of\n     more than one year may have to be passed, is to be exercised\n     after considering the further fact that apart from the sentence\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                                                                       77</span>\n\f      of imprisonment, the court has jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/640437/\" id=\"a_419\">Section\n      357(3)</a> CrPC to award suitable compensation with default\n      sentence under <a href=\"/doc/1314176/\" id=\"a_420\">Section 64</a> IPC and with further powers of\n      recovery under <a href=\"/doc/713219/\" id=\"a_421\">Section 431</a> CrPC. With this approach, prison\n      sentence of more than one year may not be required in all\n      cases.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">      18.5. Since evidence of the complaint can be given on\n      affidavit, subject to the court summoning the person giving\n      affidavit and examining him and the bank&#x27;s slip being prima\n      facie evidence of the dishonour of cheque, it is unnecessary\n      for the Magistrate to record any further preliminary evidence.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_109\">      Such affidavit evidence can be read as evidence at all stages\n      of trial or other proceedings.

A conspectus of these judgments would show that the gravamen of\n\na proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_429\">Section 138</a>, though couched in language making the\n\nact complained of an offence, is really in order to get back through a\n\nsummary proceeding, the amount contained in the dishonoured cheque\n\ntogether with interest and costs, expeditiously and cheaply. We have\n\nalready seen how it is the victim alone who can file the complaint which\n\nordinarily culminates in the payment of fine as compensation which may\n\nextend to twice the amount of the cheque which would include the amount\n\nof the cheque and the interest and costs thereupon. Given our analysis of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_430\">Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act</a> together with the\n\namendments made thereto and the case law cited hereinabove, it is clear\n\nthat a quasi-criminal proceeding that is contained in <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_431\">Chapter XVII of the\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act</a> would, given the object and context of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_432\">Section\n\n14</a> of the IBC, amount to a “proceeding” within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_433\">Section\n\n14(1)(a)</a>, the moratorium therefore attaching to such proceeding.\n\n\nQUASI-CRIMINAL PROCEEDINGS\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">                                                                       79</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_112\">\f54.   Shri Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor General, took strong\n\nobjection to the use of the expression “quasi-criminal” to describe\n\nproceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_434\">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act, which,\n\naccording to him, can only be described as criminal proceedings. This is\n\nfor the reason that these proceedings result in imprisonment or fine or\n\nboth, which are punishments that can be imposed only in criminal\n\nproceedings as stated by <a href=\"/doc/543586/\" id=\"a_435\">Section 53</a> of the Indian Penal Code. It is\n\ndifficult to agree with Shri Lekhi. There are many instances of acts which\n\nare punishable by imprisonment or fine or both which have been\n\ndescribed as quasi-criminal.

In our opinion, a proper construction of the\n      section would be that the term “officer or employee” of a\n      company in <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_441\">Section 630</a> of the Act would by a deeming\n      fiction include the legal heirs and representatives of the\n      employee or the officer concerned continuing in occupation of\n      the property of the company after the death of the employee\n      or the officer.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_174\">      16.

The failure\n      to deliver property back to the employer on the termination,\n      resignation, superannuation or death of an employee would\n      render the ‘holding’ of that property wrongful and actionable\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_443\">Section 630</a> of the Act. To hold that the “legal heirs”\n      would not be covered by the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_444\">Section 630</a> of the\n      Act would be unrealistic and illogical. It would defeat the\n      ‘beneficent’ provision and ignore the factual realities that the\n      legal heirs or family members who are continuing in\n      possession of the allotted property had obtained the right\n      of occupancy with the employee concerned in the property of\n      the employer only by virtue of their relationship with the\n      employee/officer and had not obtained or acquired the right\n      to possession of the property in any other capacity, status or\n      right. The legislature, which is supposed to know and\n      appreciate the needs of the people, by enacting <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_445\">Section 630</a>\n      of the Act manifested that it was conscious of the position that\n      today in the corporate sector — private or public enterprise —\n      the employees/officers are often provided residential\n      accommodation by the employer for the “use and occupation”\n      of the employee concerned during the course of his\n      employment. More often than not, it is a part of the service\n      conditions of the employee that the employer shall provide\n      him residential accommodation during the course of his\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                                                            82</span>\n\femployment. If an employee or a past employee or anyone\nclaiming the right of occupancy under them, were to continue\nto ‘hold’ the property belonging to the company after the right\nto be in occupation has ceased for one reason or the other, it\nwould not only create difficulties for the company, which shall\nnot be able to allot that property to its other employees, but\nwould also cause hardship for the employee awaiting\nallotment and defeat the intention of the legislature. The\ncourts are therefore obliged to place a broader, liberal and\npurposeful construction on the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_446\">Section 630</a> of the\nAct in furtherance of the object and purpose of the legislation\nand construe it in a wider sense to effectuate the intendment\nof the provision. The “heirs and legal representatives” of the\ndeceased employee have no independent capacity or status\nto continue in occupation and possession of the property,\nwhich stood allotted to the employee or the officer concerned\nor resist the return of the property to the employer in the\nabsence of any express agreement to the contrary entered\nwith them by the employer. The court, when approached by\nthe employer for taking action under <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_447\">Section 630</a> of the Act,\ncan examine the basis on which the petition/complaint is filed\nand if it is found that the company&#x27;s right to retrieve its\nproperty is quite explicit and the stand of the employee, or\nanyone claiming through him, to continue in possession is\nbaseless, it shall proceed to act under <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_448\">Section 630</a> of the Act\nand pass appropriate orders. Only an independent valid right,\nnot only to occupation but also to possession of the property\nbelonging to the company, unconnected with the employment\nof the deceased employee can defeat an action under <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_449\">Section\n630</a> of the Act if it can be established that the deceased\nemployee concerned had not wrongfully nor knowingly applied\nit for purposes other than those authorised by the employer. In\ninterpreting a beneficent provision, the court must be forever\nalive to the principle that it is the duty of the court to defend\nthe law from clever evasion and defeat and prevent\nperpetration of a legal fraud.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                                                                    83</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_116\">\f55.   Likewise, contempt of court proceedings have been described as\n\n“quasi-criminal” in a long series of judgments.

A Committee was appointed by the Government of\n\nIndia, referred to as the Sanyal Committee, which then went into whether\n\nthis expression needs to be defined. The Sanyal Committee Report, 1963\n\nthen broadly divided contempts into two kinds – civil and criminal\n\ncontempt – as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_176\">      “2.1. … Broadly speaking, the classification follows the\n      method of dividing contempt into criminal and civil contempts.\n      The Shawcross Committee adopted the same classification on\n      the grounds of convenience. Broadly speaking, civil contempts\n      are contempts which involve a private injury occasioned by\n      disobedience to the judgment, order or other process of the\n      court. On the other hand, criminal contempts are right from\n      their inception in the nature of offences. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"34813\" id=\"span_134\">In <a href=\"/doc/34813/\" id=\"a_452\">Legal\n      Remembrancer v.

A civil\n      contempt is failure to do something ordered to be done by a\n      court in a civil action for the benefit of the opposing party\n      therein. Consequently, in the case of a civil contempt, the\n      proceeding for its punishment is at the instance of the party\n      interested and is civil in its character; in the case of a criminal\n      contempt, the proceeding is for punishment of an act\n      committed against the majesty of the law, and, as the primary\n      purpose of the punishment is the vindication of the public\n      authority, the proceedings conform as nearly as possible to\n      proceedings in criminal cases. It is conceivable that the\n      dividing line between the acts constituting criminal and those\n      constituting civil contempts may become indistinct in those\n      cases where the two gradually merge into each other.”\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">                                                                            84</span>\n\f2.2.

Where the contempt\n     consists in mere failure to comply with or carry out\n     an order of a court made for the benefit of a\n     private party, it is plainly civil contempt and it has\n     been said that when the party, in whose interest\n     the order was made, moves the court for action to\n     be taken in contempt against the contemner with a\n     view to an enforcement of his right, the proceeding\n     is only a form of execution. In such a case, there is\n     no criminality in the disobedience, and the\n     contempt, such as it is, is not criminal. If, however,\n     the contemner adds defiance of the court to\n     disobedience of the order and conducts himself in\n     a manner which amounts to obstruction or\n     interference with the course of justice, the\n     contempt committed by him is of a mixed\n     character, partaking as between him and his\n     opponent of the nature of a civil contempt and as\n     between him and the court or the State, of the\n     nature of a criminal contempt. In cases of this\n     type, no clear distinction between civil and criminal\n     contempt can be drawn and the contempt\n     committed cannot be broadly classed as either\n     civil or criminal contempt … To put the matter in\n     other words, a contempt is merely a civil wrong\n     where there has been disobedience of an order\n     made for the benefit of a particular party, but\n     where it has consisted in setting the authority of\n     the courts at nought and has had a tendency to\n     invade the efficacy of the machinery maintained by\n     the State for the administration of justice, it is a\n     public wrong and consequently criminal in nature.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                                                                85</span>\n\f      2.3. In other words, the question whether a contempt is civil or\n      criminal is not to be judged with reference to the penalty which\n      may be inflicted but with reference to the cause for which the\n      penalty has been inflicted. …”\n                                                      (at pages 21-22)\n                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_117\">56.

It was, therefore,\n      considered advisable to have the entire law on the subject\n      scrutinised by a special committee. In pursuance of this, a\n      Committee was set up in 1961 under the Chairmanship of the\n      late Shri H. N. Sanyal the then Additional Solicitor General.\n      The Committee made a comprehensive examination of the\n      law and problems relating to contempt of Court in the light of\n      the position obtaining in our own country and various foreign\n      countries. The recommendations which the Committee made\n      took note of the importance given to freedom of speech in the\n      Constitution and of the need for safeguarding the status and\n      dignity of Courts and interests of administration of justice.\n          The recommendations of the Committee have been\n      generally accepted by Government after considering the views\n      expressed on those recommendations by the State\n      Governments, Union Territory Administrations the Supreme\n      Court, the High Courts and the Judicial Commissioners.

In view of the above, the law can be summarised that the\nHigh Court has a power to initiate the contempt proceedings\nsuo motu for ensuring the compliance with the orders passed\nby the Court. However, contempt proceedings being quasi-\ncriminal in nature, the same standard of proof is required in\nthe same manner as in other criminal cases. The alleged\ncontemnor is entitled to the protection of all safeguards/rights\nwhich are provided in the criminal jurisprudence, including the\nbenefit of doubt. There must be a clear-cut case of obstruction\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                                                                   92</span>\n\f      of administration of justice by a party intentionally to bring the\n      matter within the ambit of the said provision. The alleged\n      contemnor is to be informed as to what is the charge, he has\n      to meet. Thus, specific charge has to be framed in precision.\n      The alleged contemnor may ask the Court to permit him to\n      cross-examine the witnesses i.e. the deponents of affidavits,\n      who have deposed against him. In spite of the fact that\n      contempt proceedings are quasi-criminal in nature, provisions\n      of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_479\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973 (hereinafter called\n      “<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_480\">CrPC</a>”) and the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_481\">Evidence Act</a> are not attracted for the reason\n      that proceedings have to be concluded expeditiously. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"464435439\" id=\"span_160\">Thus,\n      the trial has to be concluded as early as possible. The case\n      should not rest only on surmises and conjectures. There must\n      be clear and reliable evidence to substantiate the allegations\n      against the alleged contemnor. The proceedings must be\n      concluded giving strict adherence to the statutory rules framed\n      for the purpose.”\n\n\nIn <a href=\"/doc/464435439/\" id=\"a_482\">Maninderjit Singh Bitta v. Union of India</a>, (2012) 1 SCC 273, this\n\nCourt again referred to “civil” and “criminal” contempt as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_205\">      “17. <a href=\"/doc/1033776/\" id=\"a_483\">Section 12</a> of the 1971 Act deals with the contempt of\n      court and its punishment while <a href=\"/doc/1370898/\" id=\"a_484\">Section 15</a> deals with\n      cognizance of criminal contempt. Civil contempt would be\n      wilful breach of an undertaking given to the court or wilful\n      disobedience of any judgment or order of the court, while\n      criminal contempt would deal with the cases where by words,\n      spoken or written, signs or any matter or doing of any act\n      which scandalises, prejudices or interferes, obstructs or even\n      tends to obstruct the due course of any judicial proceedings,\n      any court and the administration of justice in any other\n      manner. Under the English law, the distinction between\n      criminal and civil contempt is stated to be very little and that\n      too of academic significance. However, under both the English\n      and Indian law these are proceedings sui generis.\n      xxx xxx xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_206\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"94769570\" id=\"span_161\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1121727\" id=\"span_162\">19. Under the Indian law the conduct of the parties, the act of\n      disobedience and the attendant circumstances are relevant to\n      consider whether a case would fall under civil contempt or\n      criminal contempt. For example, disobedience of an order of a\n      court simpliciter would be civil contempt but when it is coupled\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">                                                                           93</span>\n\f      with conduct of the parties which is contemptuous, prejudicial\n      and is in flagrant violation of the law of the land, it may be\n      treated as a criminal contempt. Even under the English law,\n      the courts have the power to enforce its judgment and orders\n      against the recalcitrant parties.”\n\n\nThat contempt proceedings are “quasi-criminal” is also stated in <a href=\"/doc/1121727/\" id=\"a_485\">Kanwar\n\nSingh Saini v. High</a> Court of Delhi, (2012) 4 SCC 307 (at paragraph 38)\n\nand in <a href=\"/doc/94769570/\" id=\"a_486\">T.C. Gupta v. Bimal Kumar Dutta</a>, (2014) 14 SCC 446 (at\n\nparagraph 10).</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_207\">63.   What is clear from the aforesaid is that though there may not be any\n\nwatertight distinction between civil and criminal contempt, yet, an analysis\n\nof the aforesaid authorities would make it clear that civil contempt is\n\nessentially an action which is moved by the party in whose interest an\n\norder was made with a view to enforce its personal right, where\n\ncontumacious disregard for such order results in punishment of the\n\noffender in public interest, whereas a criminal contempt is, in essence, a\n\nproceeding which relates to the public interest in seeing that the\n\nadministration of justice remains unpolluted. What is of importance is to\n\nnote that even in cases of civil contempt, fine or imprisonment or both\n\nmay be imposed. The mere fact that punishments that are awardable\n\nrelate to <a href=\"/doc/543586/\" id=\"a_487\">Section 53</a> of the Indian Penal Code would not, therefore, render\n\na civil contempt proceeding a criminal proceeding. There is a great deal of\n\nwisdom in the finding of the Sanyal Committee Report that the question\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">                                                                          94</span>\n\fwhether a contempt is civil or criminal is not to be judged with reference to\n\nthe penalty which may be inflicted but with reference to the cause for\n\nwhich the penalty has been inflicted.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_208\">64.   Clearly, therefore, given the hybrid nature of a civil contempt\n\nproceeding, described as “quasi-criminal” by several judgments of this\n\nCourt, there is nothing wrong with the same appellation “quasi-criminal”\n\nbeing applied to a <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_488\">Section 138</a> proceeding for the reasons given by us on\n\nan analysis of <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_489\">Chapter XVII of the Negotiable Instruments Act</a>. We,\n\ntherefore, reject the learned Additional Solicitor General’s strenuous\n\nargument that the appellation “quasi-criminal” is a misnomer when it\n\ncomes to <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_490\">Section 138</a> proceedings and that therefore some of the cases\n\ncited in this judgment should be given a fresh look.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_133\">OTHER SECTIONS OF THE IBC IN RELATION TO SECTION 14 OF\nTHE IBC\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_134\">65.   Shri Mehta then argued that <a href=\"/doc/880124/\" id=\"a_491\">Section 33(5)</a> of the IBC may also be\n\nseen, as it is a provision analogous to <a href=\"/doc/173961/\" id=\"a_492\">Section 14(1)(a)</a>. <a href=\"/doc/880124/\" id=\"a_493\">Section 33(5)</a>\n\nstates as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_209\">      “33. Initiation of liquidation.—\n      xxx xxx xxx\n      (5) Subject to <a href=\"/doc/890910/\" id=\"a_494\">Section 52</a>, when a liquidation order has been\n      passed, no suit or other legal proceeding shall be instituted by\n      or against the corporate debtor:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">                                                                           95</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_210\">\f         Provided that a suit or other legal proceeding may be\n      instituted by the liquidator, on behalf of the corporate debtor,\n      with the prior approval of the Adjudicating Authority.\n      xxx xxx xxx”\n\nIt will be noted that under this Section, the expression “no suit or other\n\nlegal proceeding” occurs both in the enacting part as well as the proviso.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_211\">Going by the proviso first, given the object that the liquidator now has to\n\nact on behalf of the company after a winding-up order is passed, which\n\nincludes filing of suits and other legal proceedings on behalf of the\n\ncompany, there is no earthly reason as to why a <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_495\">Section 138</a>/<a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_496\">141</a>\n\nproceeding would be outside the ken of the proviso. On the contrary, as\n\nthe liquidator alone now represents the company, it is obvious that\n\nwhatever the company could do pre-liquidation is now vested in the\n\nliquidator, and in order to realise monies that are due to the company,\n\nthere is no reason why the liquidator cannot institute a <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_497\">Section 138</a>/<a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_498\">141</a>\n\nproceeding against a defaulting debtor of the company. Obviously, this\n\nlanguage needs to be construed in the widest possible form as there\n\ncannot be any residuary category of “other legal proceedings” which can\n\nbe instituted against some person other than the liquidator or by the\n\nliquidator who now alone represents the company. Given the object of this\n\nprovision also, what has been said earlier with regard to the non-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_212\">application of the doctrines of ejusdem generis and noscitur a sociis\n\nwould apply with all force to this provision as well.\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">                                                                         96</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_135\">\f66.   In fact, several other provisions of the IBC may also be looked at in\n\nthis context. Thus, when it comes to the duties of a resolution professional\n\nwho takes over the management of the company during the corporate\n\ninsolvency resolution process, <a href=\"/doc/1339273/\" id=\"a_499\">Section 25(2)(b)</a> states as follows:\n\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_213\">      “25. Duties of resolution professional.—\n      xxx xxx xxx\n      (2) For the purposes of sub-section (1), the resolution\n      professional shall undertake the following actions, namely—\n            xxx xxx xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_214\">             (b) represent and act on behalf of the corporate\n            debtor with third parties, exercise rights for the\n            benefit of the corporate debtor in judicial, quasi-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_136\">            judicial or arbitration proceedings;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_137\">            xxx xxx xxx”\n\nHere again, given the fact that it is the resolution professional alone who\n\nis now to preserve and protect the assets of the corporate debtor in this\n\ninterregnum, the resolution professional therefore is to represent and act\n\non behalf of the corporate debtor in all judicial, quasi-judicial, or arbitration\n\nproceedings, which would include criminal proceedings. Here again, the\n\nword “judicial” cannot be construed noscitur a sociis so as to cut down its\n\nplain meaning, as otherwise, quasi-judicial or arbitration proceedings, not\n\nbeing criminal proceedings, the word “judicial” would then take colour\n\nfrom them. This would stultify the object sought to be achieved by <a href=\"/doc/1339273/\" id=\"a_500\">Section\n\n25</a> and result in an absurdity, namely, that during this interregnum, nobody\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">                                                                               97</span>\n\fcan represent or act on behalf of the corporate debtor in criminal\n\nproceedings. Likewise, if a corporate debtor cannot be taken over by a\n\nnew management and has to be condemned to liquidation, the powers\n\nand duties of the liquidator, while representing the corporate debtor, are\n\nenumerated in <a href=\"/doc/1036533/\" id=\"a_501\">Section 35</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1036533/\" id=\"a_502\">Section 35(1)(k)</a>, in particular, states as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_215\">      “35. Powers and duties of liquidator.—(1) Subject to the\n      directions of the Adjudicating Authority, the liquidator shall\n      have the following powers and duties, namely:—\n             xxx xxx xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_216\">             (k) to institute or defend any suit, prosecution or\n             other legal proceedings, civil or criminal, in the\n             name of on behalf of the corporate debtor;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_138\">             xxx xxx xxx”\n\nThis provision specifically speaks of “prosecution” and “criminal\n\nproceedings”. Contrasted with <a href=\"/doc/1339273/\" id=\"a_503\">Section 25(2)(b)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/880124/\" id=\"a_504\">Section 33(5)</a>, an\n\nargument could be made that the absence of the expressions\n\n“prosecution” and “criminal proceedings” in <a href=\"/doc/1339273/\" id=\"a_505\">Section 25(2)(b)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/880124/\" id=\"a_506\">Section\n\n33(5)</a> would show that they were designedly eschewed by the legislature.\n\nWe have seen how inelegant drafting cannot lead to absurd results or\n\nresults which stultify the object of a provision, given its otherwise wide\n\nlanguage. Thus, nothing can be gained by juxtaposing various provisions\n\nagainst each other and arriving at conclusions that are plainly untenable\n\nin law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_139\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">                                                                        98</span>\n\fCASE LAW UNDER PROVISIONS OF OTHER STATUTES\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_140\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"326620\" id=\"span_169\">67.   Shri Mehta then relied strongly upon judgments under <a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_507\">Section 22(1)</a>\n\nof the SICA and under <a href=\"/doc/1221543/\" id=\"a_508\">Section 446(2)</a> of the Companies Act, 1956. He\n\nrelied upon <a href=\"/doc/326620/\" id=\"a_509\">BSI Ltd. v. Gift Holdings (P) Ltd.</a>, (2000) 2 SCC 737, which\n\njudgment held that the expression “suit” in <a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_510\">Section 22(1)</a> of the SICA\n\nwould not include a <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_511\">Section 138</a> proceeding. The Court was directly\n\nconcerned with only this expression and, therefore, held:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_217\">      “19. The said contention is also devoid of merits. The word\n      “suit” envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_512\">Section 22(1)</a> cannot be stretched to\n      criminal prosecutions. The suit mentioned therein is restricted\n      to “recovery of money or for enforcement of any security\n      against the industrial company or of any guarantee in respect\n      of any loans or advance granted to the industrial company”.\n      As the suit is clearly delineated in the provision itself, the\n      context would not admit of any other stretching process.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_218\">      20. A criminal prosecution is neither for recovery of money nor\n      for enforcement of any security etc. <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_513\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act\n      is a penal provision the commission of which offence entails a\n      conviction and sentence on proof of the guilt in duly conducted\n      criminal proceedings. Once the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_514\">Section 138</a> is\n      completed the prosecution proceedings can be initiated not for\n      recovery of the amount covered by the cheque but for bringing\n      the offender to penal liability. What was considered\n      in Maharashtra Tubes Ltd. [(1993) 2 SCC 144] is whether the\n      remedy provided in <a href=\"/doc/1339321/\" id=\"a_515\">Section 29</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1674414/\" id=\"a_516\">Section 31</a> of the State\n      Finance Corporation Act, 1951 could be pursued\n      notwithstanding the ban contained in <a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_517\">Section 22</a> of SICA.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_141\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"326620\" id=\"span_170\">Hence the legal principle adumbrated in <a href=\"/doc/326620/\" id=\"a_518\">the said decision</a> is of\n      no avail to the appellants.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_142\">      21. In the above context it is pertinent to point out that <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_519\">Section\n      138</a> of the NI Act was introduced in 1988 when SICA was\n      already in vogue. Even when the amplitude of the word\n      “company” mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_520\">Section 141</a> of the NI Act was\n      widened through the explanation added to the Section,\n      Parliament did not think it necessary to exclude companies\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">                                                                           99</span>\n\f      falling under <a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_521\">Section 22</a> of SICA from the operation thereof. If\n      Parliament intended to exempt sick companies from\n      prosecution proceedings, necessary provision would have\n      been included in <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_522\">Section 141</a> of the NI Act. More significantly,\n      when <a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_523\">Section 22(1)</a> of SICA was amended in 1994 by\n      inserting the words\n             “and no suit for the recovery of money or for the\n             enforcement of any security against the industrial\n             company or of any guarantee in respect of any\n             loans or advance granted to the industrial\n             company”\n      Parliament did not specifically include prosecution\n      proceedings within the ambit of the said ban.”\n\nThis case is wholly distinguishable as the word “proceedings” did not\n\ncome up for consideration at all. Further, given the object of <a href=\"/doc/1550523/\" id=\"a_524\">Section 22(1)</a>\n\nof the SICA, which was amended in 1994 by inserting the words that were\n\ninterpreted by this Court, parliament restricted proceedings only to suits\n\nfor recovery of money etc., thereby expressly not including prosecution\n\nproceedings, as was held by this Court. The observations contained in\n\nparagraph 20, that <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_525\">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act is a\n\npenal provision in a criminal proceeding cannot now be said to be good\n\nlaw given the march of events, in particular, the amendments of 2002 and\n\n2018 to the <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_526\">Negotiable Instruments Act</a>, as pointed out hereinabove, and\n\nthe later judgments of this Court interpreting <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_527\">Chapter XVII of the\n\nNegotiable Instruments Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_143\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1327885\" id=\"span_172\">68.

Deshpande</a>, (1972) 1 SCC 438 [“S.V.\n\nKandeakar”], this Court explained why income tax proceedings would be\n\noutside the purview of Section 446(2) as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_224\">      “17. Turning now to the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_531\">Income Tax Act</a> it is noteworthy that\n      Section 148 occurs in Chapter XIV which beginning with\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">                                                                        101</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_532\">Section 139</a> prescribes the procedure for assessment and\n<a href=\"/doc/177946336/\" id=\"a_533\">Section 147</a> provides for assessment or reassessment of\nincome escaping assessment. This Section empowers the\nIncome Tax Officer concerned subject to the provisions of\nSections 148 to 153 to assess or re-assess escaped income.\nWhile holding these assessment proceedings the Income Tax\nOfficer does not, in our view, perform the functions of a Court\nas contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_534\">Section 446(2)</a> of the Act. Looking at the\nlegislative history and the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/153279772/\" id=\"a_535\">Indian Companies\nAct</a>, particularly the language of Section 446, read as a whole,\nit appears to us that the expression “other legal proceeding” in\nsub-section (1) and the expression “legal proceeding” in sub-\nsection (2) convey the same sense and the proceedings in\nboth the sub-sections must be such as can appropriately be\ndealt with by the winding up court. <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_536\">The Income Tax Act</a> is, in\nour opinion, a complete code and it is particularly so with\nrespect to the assessment and re-assessment of income tax\nwith which alone we are concerned in the present case. The\nfact that after the amount of tax payable by an assessee has\nbeen determined or quantified its realisation from a company\nin liquidation is governed by the Act because the income tax\npayable also being a debt has to rank pari passu with other\ndebts due from the company does not mean that the\nassessment proceedings for computing the amount of tax\nmust be held to be such other legal proceedings as can only\nbe started or continued with the leave of the liquidation court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_537\">Section 446</a> of the Act. The liquidation court, in our\nopinion, cannot perform the functions of Income Tax Officers\nwhile assessing the amount of tax payable by the assessees\neven if the assessee be the company which is being wound\nup by the Court. The orders made by the Income Tax Officer in\nthe course of assessment or re-assessment proceedings are\nsubject to appeal to the higher hierarchy under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_538\">Income\nTax Act</a>. There are also provisions for reference to the High\nCourt and for appeals from the decisions of the High Court to\nthe Supreme Court and then there are provisions for revision\nby the Commissioner of Income Tax. It would lead to\nanomalous consequences if the winding up court were to be\nheld empowered to transfer the assessment proceedings to\nitself and assess the company to income tax. The argument\non behalf of the appellant by Shri Desai is that the winding up\ncourt is empowered in its discretion to decline to transfer the\nassessment proceedings in a given case but the power on the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">                                                                   102</span>\n\f     plain language of <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_539\">Section 446</a> of the Act must be held to vest\n     in that court to be exercised only if considered expedient. We\n     are not impressed by this argument. The language of Section\n     446 must be so construed as to eliminate such startling\n     consequences as investing the winding up court with the\n     powers of an Income Tax Officer conferred on him by the\n     <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_540\">Income Tax Act</a>, because in our view the legislature could not\n     have intended such a result.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_225\">     18.

We have not been shown any principle on\n     which the liquidation court should be vested with the power to\n     stop assessment proceedings for determining the amount of\n     tax payable by the company which is being wound up. The\n     liquidation court would have full power to scrutinise the claim\n     of the revenue after income tax has been determined and its\n     payment demanded from the liquidator. It would be open to\n     the liquidation court then to decide how far under the law the\n     amount of income tax determined by the Department should\n     be accepted as a lawful liability on the funds of the company\n     in liquidation. At that stage the winding up court can fully\n     safeguard the interests of the company and its creditors under\n     the Act. Incidentally, it may be pointed out that at the Bar no\n     English decision was brought to our notice under which the\n     assessment proceedings were held to be controlled by the\n     winding up court. On the view that we have taken, the\n     decisions in the case of Seth Spinning Mills Ltd., (In\n     Liquidation) and the Mysore Spun Silk Mills Ltd., (In\n     Liquidation) do not seem to lay down the correct rule of law\n     that the Income Tax Officers must obtain leave of the winding\n     up court for commencing or continuing assessment or re-\n     assessment proceedings.”\n\nFrom this judgment, what becomes clear is the fact that the winding-up\n\ncourt under Section 446(2) is to take up all matters which the company\n\ncourt itself can conveniently dispose of rather than exposing a company\n\nwhich is under winding up to expensive litigation in other courts. This\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">                                                                       103</span>\n\fbeing the object of Section 446(2), the expression “proceeding” was given\n\na limited meaning as it is obvious that a company court cannot dispose of\n\nan assessment proceeding in income tax or a criminal proceeding. This is\n\nfurther made clear in <a href=\"/doc/1832798/\" id=\"a_542\">Sudarshan Chits (I) Ltd. v. O. Sukumaran Pillai</a>,\n\n(1984) 4 SCC 657 (at paragraph 8) and in <a href=\"/doc/499202/\" id=\"a_543\">Central Bank of India v.\n\nElmot Engineering Co.</a>, (1994) 4 SCC 159 (at paragraph 14).</span></span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"836223\" id=\"span_180\">71.

The words “prosecution” or “criminal case”\n      are conspicuously missing in these Sections.

Therefore the\n      intention of the legislature under these Sections does not\n      appear to provide jurisdiction to the Company Court over\n      criminal proceedings either against the company or against its\n      directors. Wherever legislature thought it necessary to provide\n      such jurisdiction it has used the appropriate expressions.”\n\nIt then set out the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/38825714/\" id=\"a_554\">S.V.

This judgment dealt with a moratorium provision\n\ncontained in the <a href=\"/doc/66232754/\" id=\"a_578\">Bombay Relief Undertakings (Special Provisions) Act,\n\n1958</a>. In the context of a prosecution under paragraph 76(a) of the\n\nEmployees’ Provident Fund Scheme, 1952 this Court held:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_230\">      “6. The object of <a href=\"/doc/148539/\" id=\"a_579\">Section 4(1)(a)(iv)</a> is to declare, so to say, a\n      moratorium on actions against the undertaking during the\n      currency of the notification declaring it to be a relief\n      undertaking. By sub-clause (iv), any remedy for the\n      enforcement of an obligation or liability against the relief\n      undertaking is suspended and proceedings which are already\n      commenced are to be stayed during the operation of the\n      notification. Under <a href=\"/doc/6814423/\" id=\"a_580\">Section 4(b)</a>, on the notification ceasing to\n      have force, such obligations and liabilities revive and become\n      enforceable and the proceedings which are stayed can be\n      continued. These provisions are aimed at resurrecting and\n      rehabilitating industrial undertakings brought by inefficiency or\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                                                                          107</span>\n\fmismanagement to the brink of dissolution, posing thereby the\ngrave threat of unemployment of industrial workers. “Relief\nundertaking” means under <a href=\"/doc/328668/\" id=\"a_581\">Section 2(2)</a> an industrial\nundertaking in respect of which a declaration under <a href=\"/doc/1485731/\" id=\"a_582\">Section 3</a>\nis in force. By <a href=\"/doc/1485731/\" id=\"a_583\">Section 3</a>, power is conferred on the State\nGovernment to declare an industrial undertaking as a relief\nundertaking, “as a measure of preventing unemployment or of\nunemployment relief”. Relief undertakings, so long as they\ncontinue as such, are given immunity from legal actions so as\nto render their working smooth and effective. Such\nundertakings can be run more effectively as a measure of\nunemployment relief, if the conduct of their affairs is\nunhampered by legal proceedings or the threat of such\nproceedings.

Thus, neither the language of the statute nor its object\nwould justify the extension of the immunity so as to cover the\nindividual obligations and liabilities of the directors and other\nofficers of the undertaking.

Indeed, it would be strange if\nany such thing was within the contemplation of law. Normally,\nthe occasion for declaring an industry as a relief undertaking\nwould arise out of causes connected with defaults on the part\nof its directors and other officers. To declare a moratorium on\nlegal actions against persons whose activities have\nnecessitated the issuance of a notification in the interest of\nunemployment relief is to give to such persons the benefit of\ntheir own wrong. <a href=\"/doc/148539/\" id=\"a_585\">Section 4(1)(a)(iv)</a> therefore advisedly limits\nthe power of the State Government to direct suspension of\nremedies and stay of proceedings involving the obligations\nand liabilities in relation to a relief undertaking and which were\nincurred before the undertaking was declared a relief\nundertaking.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_156\">8.

Thus the responsibility to pay the\n      contributions to the Fund was of the appellants and if they\n      have defaulted in paying the amount, they are liable to be\n      prosecuted under para 76(a) of the Scheme which says that if\n      any person fails to pay any contribution which he is liable to\n      pay under the Scheme, he shall be punishable with six\n      months&#x27; imprisonment or with fine which may extend to one\n      thousand rupees or with both.

On the contrary, on the assumption that it\n\nwould so extend, a distinction was made between personal liability of the\n\nDirectors of the undertaking and the undertaking itself, stating that as the\n\n“employer” under the Employees’ Provident Fund Scheme would only\n\nrefer to those individuals managing the relief undertaking and not the\n\nrelief undertaking itself, the personal liability of such persons would not\n\nfall within the scope of the moratorium provision.

The Delhi\n\nHigh Court’s reasoning is contained in paragraphs 139 and 141, which\n\nare set out hereinbelow:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_232\">     “139. From the above discussion, it is clear that the objects\n     and reasons of enactment of the four legislations are distinct,\n     each operating in different field. There is no overlap. While\n     RDBA has been enacted to provide for speedier remedy for\n     banks and financial institutions to recover their dues,\n     <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_592\">SARFAESI Act</a> (with added chapter on registration of secured\n     creditor) aims at facilitating the secured creditors to\n     expeditiously and effectively enforce their security interest. In\n     each case, the amount to be recovered is “due” to the\n     claimant i.e. the banks or the financial institutions or the\n     secured creditor, as the case may be, the claim being against\n     the debtor (or his guarantor). The Insolvency Code, in\n     contrast, seeks to primarily protect the interest of creditors by\n     entrusting them with the responsibility to seek resolution\n     through a professional (RP), failure on his part leading\n     eventually to the liquidation process.”\n     xxx xxx xxx\n     “141. This court finds it difficult to accept the proposition that\n     the jurisdiction conferred on the State by PMLA to confiscate\n     the “proceeds of crime” concerns a property the value whereof\n     is “debt” due or payable to the Government (Central or State)\n     or local authority. The Government, when it exercises its\n     power under PMLA to seek attachment leading to confiscation\n     of proceeds of crime, does not stand as a creditor, the person\n     alleged to be complicit in the offence of money-laundering\n     similarly not acquiring the status of a debtor. The State is not\n     claiming the prerogative to deprive such offender of ill-gotten\n     assets so as to be perceived to be sharing the loot, not the\n     least so as to levy tax thereupon such as to give it a colour of\n     legitimacy or lawful earning, the idea being to take away what\n     has been illegitimately secured by proscribed criminal activity.”\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">                                                                          110</span>\n\fThis raison d’être is completely different from what has been advocated\n\nby Shri Mehta. The confiscation of the proceeds of crime is by the\n\ngovernment acting statutorily and not as a creditor. This judgment, again,\n\ndoes not further his case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_233\">WHETHER NATURAL PERSONS ARE COVERED BY SECTION 14 OF\nTHE IBC\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_234\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"96973002\" id=\"span_194\">77.

Parekh [(1970) 3 SCC\n      491 : 1971 SCC (Cri) 97] which is by a larger Bench and\n      hence, is a binding precedent. On the aforesaid ratiocination,\n      the decision in Anil Hada [(2000) 1 SCC 1 : 2001 SCC (Cri)\n      174] has to be treated as not laying down the correct law as\n      far as it states that the Director or any other officer can be\n      prosecuted without impleadment of the company. Needless to\n      emphasise, the matter would stand on a different footing\n      where there is some legal impediment and the doctrine of lex\n      non cogit ad impossibilia gets attracted.”\n      xxx xxx xxx\n      “56.

It\nis to be kept in mind that the power of punishment is vested in\nthe legislature and that is absolute in <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_600\">Section 141</a> of the Act\nwhich clearly speaks of commission of offence by the\ncompany. The learned counsel for the respondents have\nvehemently urged that the use of the term “as well as” in the\nSection is of immense significance and, in its tentacle, it\nbrings in the company as well as the Director and/or other\nofficers who are responsible for the acts of the company and,\ntherefore, a prosecution against the Directors or other officers\nis tenable even if the company is not arraigned as an\naccused. The words “as well as” have to be understood in the\ncontext.”\nxxx xxx xxx\n“58. Applying the doctrine of strict construction, we are of the\nconsidered opinion that commission of offence by the\ncompany is an express condition precedent to attract the\nvicarious liability of others. Thus, the words “as well as the\ncompany” appearing in the Section make it absolutely\nunmistakably clear that when the company can be\nprosecuted, then only the persons mentioned in the other\ncategories could be vicariously liable for the offence subject to\nthe averments in the petition and proof thereof. One cannot be\noblivious of the fact that the company is a juristic person and it\nhas its own respectability. If a finding is recorded against it, it\nwould create a concavity in its reputation. There can be\nsituations when the corporate reputation is affected when a\nDirector is indicted.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_236\">59. In view of our aforesaid analysis, we arrive at the\nirresistible conclusion that for maintaining the prosecution\nunder <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_601\">Section 141</a> of the Act, arraigning of a company as an\naccused is imperative.
