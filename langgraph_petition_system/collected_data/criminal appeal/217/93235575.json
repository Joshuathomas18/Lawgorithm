It is\n\nalleged by Heera - complainant (PW-1) in his statement (Ex.

The eldest is Inder (appellant) and Ram\n\nNiwas (deceased) was younger than him. The complainant Heera\n\n(PW1) is the youngest of all. Inder (appellant) was living separate\n\nfrom them for the last eight years at Kabari Road, Panipat. The\n\ncomplainant Heera and Ram Niwas (deceased) were staying with\n\ntheir parents. His parents had six killas (acres) of land. Inder\n\n(appellant) had separated from his parents eight years earlier to the\n\nlodging of the FIR (Ex.PU) by giving him money in cash in lieu of\n\nthe land. Inder (appellant), however, used to come to their house\n\non many occassions and demanded land in division but his parents\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                                  [3]</span>\n\n\nand Ram Niwas (deceased) used to tell him that he had taken\n\nmoney in cash and now what was the share in the land to be given\n\nfor. On this account, Inder (appellant) had nursed an inner\n\njealousy against Ram Niwas, but despite that he had been coming\n\nto their house quite often. On 16.11.2002 at about 4.30 p.m., when\n\nthe complainant reached home then Inder (appellant) had come to\n\ntheir house. His sister-in-law (Bhabi) Kamlesh, wife of Ram\n\nNiwas (deceased) was also at home. The complainant Heera\n\n(PW1) and his brother&#x27;s wife (Bhabi) Kamlesh asked Inder\n\n(appellant) to sit but he refused and said that he was in a hurry and\n\nhe had to go with Ram Niwas (deceased) to see a plot. Ram Niwas\n\n(deceased) was, however, not at home at that time and Inder\n\n(appellant) went back. At about 9.30 p.m. at night their relative\n\nSuresh Kumar son of Om Parkash (PW-3) had come from Jeetgarh\n\nto their house and informed them that near village Ram Nagar\n\nsome persons had inflicted injuries to Ram Niwas and he was\n\nadmitted in the Civil Hospital, Panipat. The complainant Heera,\n\nand his father Mai Chand (PW-2) reached the hospital at Panipat.\n\nThere they saw that the face of Ram Niwas (deceased) was\n\nsmeared with blood and he had suffered many injuries with a sharp\n\nedged weapon. On asking Ram Niwas (deceased) for quite some\n\ntime, he (Ram Niwas) was only able to say that Inder (appellant)\n\nwith the help of his companions had inflicted injuries on him.\n\nThereafter, Ram Niwas due to the injuries that he had suffered\n\ndied. The complainant, Heera, had complete suspicion that his\n\nbrother Inder (appellant) had committed the murder of his other\n\nbrother Ram Niwas with the help of his companions on account of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                                 [4]</span>\n\n\nthe grudge that he (Inder-appellant) nursed for not getting his\n\nshare in the land from his parents.

The learned Additional Sessions Judge,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                                 [8]</span>\n\n\nPanipat, to whom the case was assigned, chargesheeted the\n\nappellants in terms of the charge sheet dated 16.12.2003 on the\n\nallegation that on 16.11.2002 at about 8-9 p.m., in the area of Ram\n\nNagar, Police Station Model Town, Panipat, both the respective\n\nappellants in furtherance of their common intention committed\n\nmurder by intentionally causing the death of Ram Niwas by &#x27;Dao&#x27;\n\n(sharp edged weapon used in agriculture) and, thus, they both\n\ncommitted an offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 302</a> IPC read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 34</a> IPC and appellants were directed to be tried by the said\n\nCourt. The accused pleaded not guilty to the charge and claimed\n\ntrial. The prosecution in order to prove its case examined as many\n\nas 12 witnesses; besides, documents were tendered in evidence.\n\nThe statements of the respective appellants in terms of <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 313</a>\n\nCr.P.C. were recorded. The substance of the evidence appearing\n\nagainst the appellants was put to them. Both the respective\n\nappellants took the stand that they were innocent and had been\n\nfalsely implicated in this case. In defence the appellants examined\n\nKamla wife of Hawa Singh as DW-1 and Malo Devi wife of\n\nRoshan Lal as DW2. It is stated by Kamla (DW-1) that she knew\n\nInder (appellant) whose house was situated at a distance of 10/12\n\nhouses away from her house. It is stated that in the morning of\n\n17th (17.11.2002) at about 2.30/3.00 a.m. three persons came to\n\nher residence. She did not know whether they were police officials\n\nor somebody else. At that time on her asking they told her that\n\nthey were police officials. She was asked about the house of\n\nRoshan Lal. She stated that his house was situated at a distance of\n\n2 houses from her house. Thereafter, the police persons went to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                                  [9]</span>\n\n\nthe house of Roshan Lal. They heard a noise in the mohalla and\n\nsaw three/four persons with police officials including the lady in\n\nwhose house the police went. In cross-examination, it is stated that\n\nshe had seen Inder (appellant) along with the police on that night\n\nand the police had brought/apprehended Inder (appellant) from his\n\nhouse. It is stated that it was incorrect to suggest that Inder\n\n(appellant) was accompanying the police officials at the time when\n\nthey first knocked the door of their house. Malo Devi (DW2)\n\nstated that she knew Inder (appellant) being her neighbour. The\n\ndistance between their house and the house of Inder (appellant)\n\nwas about 10/12 houses. At mid-night three persons knocked at\n\nthe door and asked about the house of Inder (appellant). At that\n\ntime, the said persons told her that they were police officials. Malo\n\nDevi (DW2) accompanied them to the residence of Inder\n\n(appellant). On calling Inder (appellant), he came down along with\n\nhis   family   members.     Thereafter,   Inder   (appellant)    was\n\napprehended. In cross-examination it is stated by Malo Devi\n\n(DW2) that Inder (appellant) was her relative. Kamla (DW1) is\n\nneighbour of Inder (appellant). She stated that it was incorrect to\n\nsuggest that she was deposing in favour of Inder (appellant) being\n\nher relative. She denied the suggestion that the police officials had\n\ncome to her residence on the night of 17.11.2002. It is also denied\n\nas in correct that police officials apprehended Inder (appellant) on\n\nthat night from his residence. The learned trial Court after\n\nconsidering the evidence and material on record, as already\n\nnoticed, convicted and sentenced the appellants in pursuance of\n\nthe impugned judgment and order which is assailed in this appeal.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                                   [10]</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">             Sh. Aman Chaudhary, Advocate learned counsel\n\nappearing for Inder (appellant) as amicus curiae, has contended\n\nthat the prosecution has miserably failed to prove and establish its\n\ncase against the appellants. It is submitted that the present is not a\n\ncase of any eye witness account and is based only on\n\ncircumstantial evidence, which does not inspire confidence so as\n\nto record a finding of guilt. It is further submitted that even in case\n\nof circumstantial evidence there is no evidence of last seen nor\n\nthere is any dying declaration. A reference has been made to the\n\ndeposition of Dr.K.L.Chopra (PW-9), who has stated that at the\n\ntime of examination of Ram Niwas (deceased) he was unable to\n\nspeak properly. It is further submitted that the extra judicial\n\nconfession before Ram Mehar (PW-8) is not believable and he, in\n\nfact, was a total stranger; besides, no reliance can be placed on the\n\ndisclosure statement (Ex.PC) of Inder (appellant). Lastly it is\n\nsubmitted that there was no motive or any thing to connect Inder\n\n(appellant) to commit the murder of his own brother Ram Niwas.\n\nIn fact, the witnesses had deposed against the appellants for their\n\nown selfishness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">             Ms. Anju Arora, Advocate learned counsel appearing\n\nfor Montu (appellant) as amicus curiae, has submitted that the\n\nidentity of the appellant, Montu, is not at all established. It is\n\nsubmitted that apart from the appellant Montu having no motive\n\nhe is not a family member of Inder (appellant), the complainant\n\nand deceased. A reference has been made to the deposition of\n\nBalwant Singh, ASI (PW-11), who it is submitted did not collect\n\nany documentary proof regarding Inder (appellant) serving at the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                                 [11]</span>\n\n\nSainik factory, where he was alleged to be serving; besides, it is\n\nsubmitted that Rattan Singh, SI/SHO (PW-12) has deposed that\n\nduring investigation he could not find any proof of the appellants\n\nbeing close friends or even on visiting terms with each other.\n\nTherefore, it is submitted that the appellant Montu in any case is\n\nliable to be acquitted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">             In response Sh.H.S.Sran, Addl.A.G.Haryana, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the State has submitted that Rajbir (PW-14),\n\nwho is the brother-in-law of the appellant and deceased as well as\n\nthe complainant, has supported the prosecution case. It is\n\nsubmitted that the involvement of Montu (appellant) is clearly\n\nestablished inasmuch as he was a close friend of Inder (appellant)\n\nand, therefore, his role is also clearly established. It is submitted\n\nthat the learned trial Court after considering the entire evidence\n\nand material on record reached at a clear finding regarding the\n\ninvolvement and role of the appellants, which would not warrant\n\nany interference by this Court in the well reasoned judgment and\n\norder passed by the learned trial Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">             We have given our thoughtful consideration to the\n\ncontentions of the learned counsel for the parties and with their\n\nassistance gone through the record of the case. In order to\n\nappreciate the contentions of the learned counsel for the parties, it\n\nmay be noticed that the deceased Ram Niwas and Inder (appellant)\n\nare brothers and Montu (appellant) is stated to be a close friend of\n\nInder (appellant).

He has stated that he and Ram\n\nNiwas (deceased) used to live with their parents while Inder\n\n(appellant) had separated from them and was residing at Arjun\n\nNagar, Kabri Road, Panipat. His father namely Mai Chand (PW2)\n\nhad sold four killas (acres) of land out of six killas. Cash amount\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                                 [13]</span>\n\n\nof the share of Inder (appellant) was paid to him in lieu of the land\n\nof his share. Therefore, Inder (appellant) was not left with any\n\nshare in the remaining land. However, he used to come to their\n\nhouse and used to demand his share again from his brother Ram\n\nNiwas (deceased) and his father Mai Chand (PW-2). On\n\n16.11.2002 at about 4.30 p.m., Inder (appellant) came to their\n\nhouse. Kamlesh, wife of Ram Niwas (deceased) and the\n\ncomplainant Heera were present in the house at that time. The\n\ncomplainant and Kamlesh asked Inder (appellant) to sit but he\n\nrefused by saying that he was in a hurry. He (Inder-appellant) said\n\nthat he wanted to take Ram Niwas (deceased) with him for\n\nshowing a plot. However, Ram Niwas (deceased) was not present\n\nat home at that time and Inder (appellant) went back. On\n\n16.11.2002 at about 9.30 p.m. their reletive Suresh Kumar son of\n\nOm Parkash (PW-3) resident of Jeetgarh had come to their house\n\nand informed that some persons had caused injuries to Ram Niwas\n\nin the area of village Ram Nagar and he was admitted in the Civil\n\nHospital, Panipat. The complainant Heera and his father Mai\n\nChand (PW-2) went to the Civil Hospital at Panipat and found that\n\nthe face of Ram Niwas (deceased) was smeared with blood and he\n\nhad suffered many injuries on his face and head which had been\n\ncaused with a sharp edged weapon. On enquiry Ram Niwas\n\n(deceased) told them that Inder (appellant) and his companion had\n\ncaused injuries to him. Ram Niwas died after about 15-20 minutes.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">Due to enmity of not giving a share in the land, Inder (appellant)\n\nhad murdered Ram Niwas with the help of his companion. The\n\ncomplainant Heera (PW-1) was cross-examined by the learned\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                                 [14]</span>\n\n\ncounsel for the respective appellants. In cross examination on\n\nbehalf of Inder (appellant) it is stated by Heera (complainant PW1)\n\nthat his brother Ram Niwas (deceased) was an agriculturist. He\n\nwas working in village Thirana and on 16.11.2002 he had gone to\n\nvillage Thirana during working season. There was no particular\n\ntime for him to go to the fields and return home. His father had six\n\nacres of land in village Thirana. The complainant (PW1), his\n\nfather (Mai Chand) and Ram Niwas (deceased) used to look after\n\nthe fields. It is further stated by the complainant (PW1) that Duli\n\nChand who is the elder brother of his father did not transfer any\n\nland in favour of Inder (appellant). The agricultural land at village\n\nThirana near Assan was purchased by his father. Inder (appellant)\n\nit is stated had separated from the joint family about 10 years ago\n\nand he was paid an amount of Rs.4,50,000/- as his share. When\n\nInder (appellant) had separated, a writing was done. The amount\n\nof Rs.4,50,000/-, it is stated, was not paid in his presence nor he\n\nsigned the proceedings. It is stated that Rs.1 lac was arranged from\n\ntheir own savings and Rs.1,50,000/- was obtained from the\n\nrelatives and one tractor and other agricultural equipments\n\namounting to Rs.2 lacs were given to Inder (appellant). The tractor\n\nwas of Escort make and he could not tell the model of the tractor.\n\nHe could not tell the exact cost of tractor and other equipments\n\nwhich were assessed at that time. They borrowed Rs.70,000/- from\n\nhis brother-in-law (Jija) namely Pala resident of Murthal and\n\nRs.70,000/- were borrowed from his maternal uncle namely Pala\n\nresident of Tarori. His father had brought the cash from village\n\nTarori and his brother Ram Niwas (deceased) had brought the cash\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                               [15]</span>\n\n\nfrom Murthal. He, however, could not tell the date, time and place\n\nwhen the money was given to Inder (appellant). No share was\n\ngiven to him (complainant) and Ram Niwas. Neither was it\n\ndisclosed as to how much amount would come to their share. It is\n\nfurther stated that Rs.4,50,000/- came in share of each i.e. Inder\n\n(appellant), Ram Niwas (deceased) and the complainant himself.\n\nHe had not brought the document in which the share was\n\nmentioned. The said document was written in the Tehsil Panipat.\n\nNone of the relatives had signed that document. In further cross-\n\nexamination on behalf of Inder and Montu (appellants), it is stated\n\nby Heera (complainant PW1) that it was wrong to suggest that\n\nfather-in-law of Om Parkash (PW3) transferred some agriculture\n\nland in favour of accused Inder. It was also wrong to suggest that\n\naccused Inder was adopted by Duli Chand, father-in-law of Om\n\nParkash. It was also wrong to suggest that wife of Om Parkash was\n\ndemanding her share from Inder. It was also wrong to suggest that\n\non that account a quarrel had taken place at any time between\n\nInder and wife of Om Parkash who is the daughter of Duli Chand.\n\nIt was also wrong to suggest that the complainant (PW1) had\n\nconspired with Om Parkash (PW3) and murdered Ram Niwas. It\n\nwas also wrong to suggest that they had falsely implicated Inder\n\n(appellant) in the present case for grabbing his share. It was also\n\nwrong to suggest that Om Parkash (PW3) became a false witness\n\nin the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">             It may, therefore, be noticed that the defence set up\n\nby Inder (appellant) is that he himself had been adopted by Duli\n\nChand. As already noticed Duli Chand is the elder brother of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                               [16]</span>\n\n\nfather of the complainant, the deceased Ram Niwas and Inder\n\n(appellant) and is the father-in-law of Om Parkash (PW3). In fact\n\nas has also been noticed, Duli Chand had four sons and one of\n\nthem had died. Therefore, there was no circumstance for Duli\n\nChand to adopt Inder as his son. Even otherwise, nothing has been\n\nbrought on record as to when said adoption had taken place.\n\nBesides, the adoption would not be valid in view of the provision\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/535457/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11 (i)</a> of the Hindu Adoptions and Maintenance Act,\n\n1956 which provides for certain conditions to be complied with\n\nfor the purpose of adoption and it is inter alia provided that if\n\nadoption is of a son, the adoptive father or mother by whom the\n\nadoption is to be made must not have a Hindu son, son&#x27;s son or\n\nson&#x27;s son&#x27;s son (whether by legitimate blood relationship or by\n\nadoption) living at the time of adoption.   Duli Chand, therefore,\n\nhaving four sons could not legally adopt Inder as a son. Apart\n\nfrom putting the suggestion that Inder (appellant) had been\n\nadopted by Duli Chand there is nothing else on record in this\n\nregard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">            Mai Chand (PW-2), father of the appellant Inder and\n\nRam Niwas (deceased) has corroborated the version of the\n\ncomplainant Heera (PW1). It is stated by Mai Chand (PW-2) that\n\nhe had three sons i.e. Inder (appellant) who was his elder son, Ram\n\nNiwas (deceased) was younger to him and Heera (PW1) was the\n\nyoungest. The appellant Inder, it is stated, used to live separate\n\nfrom them at Arjun Nagar, Kabri Road, Panipat. Ram Niwas and\n\nHeera were living with him (PW2) he had six killas (acres) of\n\nland. Inder (appellant) had separated from them about 10 years\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                              [17]</span>\n\n\nback. He was paid Rs.4.5 lacs by him (Mai Chand) which was full\n\npayment of his share in the land from his property at the time of\n\nseparation. Mai Chand (PW2) sold four killas (acres) of land after\n\nhis separation. Inder (appellant) demanded his share from the sale\n\nproceeds of the said four killas of land. Mai Chand (PW2) and\n\nRam Niwas (deceased) told Inder (appellant) that he had already\n\ntaken his share. Mai Chand (PW2) also told Inder (appellant) that\n\nRam Niwas (deceased) was the &#x27;Karta Dharta&#x27; of his house.\n\nHowever, Inder (appellant) demanded his share in the remaining\n\ntwo killas of land to which he (PW2) and Ram Niwas (deceased)\n\nhad refused. On this account Inder indulged in altercations for\n\ntaking his share and he (appellant) harboured enmity due to this\n\nreason. On 16.11.2002 Suresh son of Om Parkash (PW3) resident\n\nof Jeetgarh came to their house at about 9.30 p.m. and informed\n\nthat Ram Niwas (deceased) had suffered injuries and was admitted\n\nin Civil Hospital, Panipat. Mai Chand (PW2), his son Heera\n\n(PW1) and informer Suresh went to Civil Hospital, Panipat. They\n\nsaw that the face and head of Ram Niwas (deceased) were smeared\n\nwith blood and Ram Niwas had suffered injuries on his face and\n\nhead. They asked Ram Niwas again and again and he merely\n\nstated that Inder (appellant) had caused injuries to him with his\n\ncompanion namely Bantu Bihari. Mai Chand (PW2) had full\n\nsuspicion that Inder (appellant) had murdered Ram Niwas with the\n\nhelp of his companion as he was not giving his share in the\n\nproperty. Ram Niwas (deceased) before his death had told his\n\nfather Mai Chand (PW2) that the injuries had been caused by\n\nInder (appellant) along with his companion. In the cross-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                                [18]</span>\n\n\nexamination it is stated by Mai Chand (PW2) that when Inder\n\n(appellant) was living with them at that time, he owned six acres\n\nof land in village Thirana. He had two acres of land in the area of\n\nvillage Sondhapur at Jatal Road. He sold his land in village\n\nSondhapur about 10 years earlier and after that he purchased six\n\nacres of land in village Thirana. He denied the suggestion that two\n\nacres of land in village Sondhapur was their ancestral property.\n\nWhen he purchased land in village Thirana, Inder (appellant) was\n\nliving with them. After harvesting of wheat crop Inder (appellant)\n\nwas separated from them and he (Mai Chand PW2) gave him his\n\nshare in cash and some other articles (agricultural equipments). It\n\nis stated that a writing was made before the Tehsildar when\n\naccused Inder (appellant) was separated from the joint family. It is\n\nstated that he did not remember when his father and his brother\n\nDuli Chand had died. His father Duli Chand had four sons and one\n\nof them had died. Murti is the daughter of Duli Chand. It is stated\n\nas correct that she was married with Om Parkash (PW3) resident\n\nof Jitgarh. Mai Chand (PW2) was cross-examined at considerable\n\nlength. However, nothing could be brought out; which may favour\n\nthe appellant. Om Parkash (PW3) has stated that Inder (appellant)\n\nwas known to him. He was related to Om Parkash (PW3) as his\n\nbrother-in-law (i.e. his wife&#x27;s father&#x27;s younger brother&#x27;s son). On\n\n16.11.2002 Om Parkash (PW3) was present at his house and at\n\nabout 8.30 p.m. he received information from some person that\n\none person was lying injured on the &#x27;patri&#x27; (embankment) of the\n\ncanal and was calling him. He (PW3) took some neighbour with\n\nhim and went on a motorcycle to that place. There he saw Ram\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                               [19]</span>\n\n\nNiwas (deceased) lying in an injured condition. Ram Niwas was\n\nlying on the &#x27;patri&#x27; (embankment) of the canal towards Sithana\n\nvillage near Burji No.41. Om Parkash (PW3) asked Ram Niwas as\n\nto how he suffered the injuries, on which he told him that Inder\n\n(appellant) and one Bihari had caused injuries to him. Om Parkash\n\n(PW 3) took Ram Niwas to the Civil Hospital, Panipat and got him\n\nadmitted there. He (PW3) sent his son Suresh Kumar to the house\n\nof Ram Niwas (deceased) for informing his family members. After\n\nsometime Heera (PW1)- brother of Ram Niwas (deceased) and his\n\nfather Mai Chand (PW2) reached Civil Hospital, Panipat. Ram\n\nNiwas (deceased), it is stated, also told Heera (PW1) and Mai\n\nChand (PW2) in his presence that Inder (appellant) and one Bihari\n\nhad caused injuries to him. After sometime, Ram Niwas died due\n\nto the injuries that he had suffered. The police reached Civil\n\nHospital, Panipat and recorded the statement of Om Parkash\n\n(PW3). On 17.11.2002, Om Parkash (PW3) took the police to the\n\nplace where from he had picked up Ram Niwas (deceased) from\n\nthe &#x27;patri&#x27; (embankment) of the canal. The police prepared a rough\n\nsite plan of that place as disclosed by Om Parkash (PW3). The\n\npolice lifted blood stained earth and also recovered a black colour\n\n&#x27;chappal&#x27; (slipper) of the deceased. The police prepared parcels of\n\nthe blood stained earth lifted from that place and the &#x27;chappal&#x27;\n\n(slipper) and the same were sealed with the seal RS and were\n\ntaken in possession by the police vide memo Ex.PB which bears\n\nhis signatures. At that time Rameshwar, Panch was also present.\n\nOm Parkash (PW3) was cross-examined at considerable length.\n\nHowever, nothing which may favour the appellant          could be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                               [20]</span>\n\n\nbrought out from him. In the cross-examination it is stated by Om\n\nParkash (PW3) that his village falls within the jurisdiction of\n\nPolice Station, Model Town, Panipat. It is stated that the police\n\nrecovered the &#x27;chappal&#x27; (slipper) of Ram Niwas from the place of\n\noccurrence which was lying at a distance of about 5-7 feet from\n\nRam Niwas. It is stated that the name of his father-in-law was Duli\n\nChand and he had died. He did not know whether his father-in-law\n\nDuli Chandi transferred any land of his share to Inder (appellant).\n\nHe denied the suggestion that his wife namely Murti indulged in\n\nfights with the appellant Inder a number of times for giving her\n\nshare in the land transferred to Inder (appellant) by Duli Chand.\n\nHe denied the suggestion that when he reached the place of\n\noccurrence, Ram Niwas (deceased) was lying in an unconscious\n\ncondition and subsequently he died.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">            It may be noticed that the statement of Ram Niwas\n\n(deceased) is in the nature of a dying declaration. The three\n\nwitnesses namely Heera (PW1), Mai Chand (PW2) and Om\n\nParkash (PW3) who are closely related with the appellant Inder\n\nhave stated that Ram Niwas (deceased) informed them that he was\n\ncaused injuries by Inder (appellant) and one Bihari. In view of\n\ntheir close relationship there was no reason for them to falsely\n\ninvolve the appellant Inder, who is none other than the brother of\n\nHeera (PW1), the son of Mai Chand (PW2) and the brother-in-law\n\nof Om Parkash (PW3). In the circumstances, the contention of the\n\nlearned counsel for the appellants that it is not a case of eye\n\nwitness account and only circumstantial evidence is there is\n\ninconsequential. In fact the circumstances on record from the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                                 [21]</span>\n\n\ndepositions of Heera (PW1), Mai Chand (PW2) and Om Parkash\n\n(PW3) are complete insofar as Inder (appellant) is concerned and\n\nthese unerringly point towards his guilt. The contention that there\n\nis no dying declaration in the circumstance is devoid of merit as a\n\ndying declaration was made by Ram Niwas (deceased) which is\n\nestablished and proved from the depositions of Heera-complainant\n\n(PW-1), Mai Chand (PW-2) and Om Parkash (PW-3), who are the\n\nclose relatives of the appellant Inder as also the deceased. Besides,\n\nthere is a motive also for the appellant Inder to commit the murder\n\nof Ram Niwas as he (Inder-appellant) felt that Ram Niwas\n\n(deceased) was coming in the way for the share of the land that\n\nwas sold by Mai Chand (PW2) to be given to him (Inder-\n\nappellant). It has come on record that Inder (appellant) had\n\nseparated from his family about 8-10 years earlier to the incident\n\nthat had occurred and he was at that time given an amount of\n\nRs.4,50,000/- in cash in lieu of his share in the land. Despite that\n\nhe was demanding his share again, which was objected to; besides,\n\non the day of occurrence he had come to the house of his father\n\nand wanted to take Ram Niwas (deceased) with him on the pretext\n\nof showing him a plot. Therefore, it was he (Inder-appellant), who\n\nwas wanting to take Ram Niwas (deceased) out of his house and it\n\nnow transpires that he wanted to take him with an intention to\n\nmurder him. In the circumstances, it cannot be said that there was\n\nno motive for Inder (appellant) to commit the murder of Ram\n\nNiwas.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">             An extra judicial confession was made by Inder\n\n(appellant) before Ram Mehar (PW-8) who has supported the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                               [22]</span>\n\n\nprosecution case. It is stated by Ram Mehar (PW8) that on\n\n18.11.2002, he was present at his house and Inder (appellant)\n\nalong with his co-accused came to him at his house before noon.\n\nInder (appellant) told him that they were three brothers and there\n\nwas a dispute between them regarding land. Inder (appellant) told\n\nRam Mehar (PW8) that his parents had not given him full share of\n\nhis land. Inder also told Ram Mehar (PW8) that his brothers Heera\n\n(PW1) and Ram Niwas (deceased) were living together. He also\n\ntold Ram Mehar (PW8) that he had demanded his share from his\n\nfamily members but they refused. He further stated that he made a\n\nconspiracy with Montu (appellant) to murder Ram Niwas his\n\nbrother. Thereafter, he purchased a &#x27;Dao&#x27; and along with Montu\n\n(appellant) took Ram Niwas at the Paschmi Yamuna Canal. Inder\n\n(appellant) further told Ram Mehar (PW8) that Montu Bihari\n\n(appellant) had caught hold of the hands of Ram Niwas and he\n\n(Inder) caused injuries on the person of Ram Niwas with a &#x27;Dao&#x27;.\n\nHe also told Ram Mehar (PW8) that Ram Niwas (deceased) had\n\ndisclosed his name to the family members at the Civil Hospital,\n\nPanipat and requested him to produce them before the police.\n\nWhen Ram Mehar (PW8) was going to produce Inder and Montu\n\n(appellants) before the police near Sikandarpur Turn near Kabri\n\nRoad, the police met him and he produced both the accused before\n\nthe police. Ram Mehar (PW8) was cross-examined. An extra\n\njudicial confession as is well-known is a weak type of evidence,\n\nhowever, in the facts and circumstances of the present case, the\n\nsame corroborates the chain of circumstances that have come on\n\nrecord. Therefore, it can be taken into account being corroborative\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                                 [23]</span>\n\n\nin nature.   Even otherwise, the case against the appellant Inder\n\nstands established on the basis of facts and circumstances and of\n\nthe dying declaration made by Ram Niwas soon before his death\n\nbefore his brother Heera (PW-1), father Mai Chand (PW-2) and\n\nhis brother-in-law Om Parkash (PW-3). Therefore, even if the\n\nextra judicial confession is not entirely to relied upon, the case of\n\nthe prosecution would be otherwise established against the\n\nappellant Inder. It is quite rare that in a murder case one can get\n\nthe brother, father and brother-in-law of an accused to depose\n\nagainst him. However, they having done so it creates an assurance\n\nthat the appellant Inder had indeed committed the murder of Ram\n\nNiwas.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">The appellant Inder also made a disclosure statement (Ex.PC)\n\nwhich led to the recovery of &#x27;Dao&#x27; that was used in the occurrence.\n\nWith the &#x27;Dao&#x27; he gave many blows on the face and head of Ram\n\nNiwas (deceased). Dr. K.L. Chopra (PW-9), who medico legally\n\nexamined Ram Niwas and thereafter conducted his postmortem\n\nexamination, has clearly established the injuries that were inflicted\n\non the person of Ram Niwas (deceased).

Otherwise his presence from the material and evidence\n\non record is not established. It has come in the evidence of the\n\nprosecution that Inder (appellant) was accompanied by another\n\ncompanion, who was a Bihari. Therefore, merely because Montu\n\nhappens to be a Bihari, it cannot be said that his involvement in\n\nthe crime is established. Ms. Anju Arora, Advocate learned\n\ncounsel appearing for appellant Montu is, therefore, quite right in\n\nher contention that the identity of Montu (appellant) is not\n\nestablished. Balwant Singh, ASI (PW-11) in his cross-examination\n\nstated that he could not say as to what was being manufactured at\n\nthe Sainik factory from where the accused Montu (appellant) got\n\nhis clothes recovered. The clothes which Montu (appellant) got\n\nrecovered in pursuance of his disclosure statement (Ex.PD),\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\"> CRA Nos.327-DB &amp; 464-DB of 2006                                [28]</span>\n\n\ntherefore, cannot be said to be the same, which he was allegedly\n\nwearing at the time of occurrence. It is further stated by Balwant\n\nSingh, ASI (PW-11) that he did not collect any documentary proof\n\nregarding the appellant Montu serving in the Sainik factory. In the\n\npresence of Balwant Singh, ASI (PW-11) neither the statement of\n\nowner nor that of the labourers of the said factory were recorded\n\nby the Investigating Officer Rattan Singh, SI/SHO (PW-12). No\n\nlabourer of the factory was joined in the investigation at the time\n\nof recovery by the Investigating Officer; besides, no material was\n\ngathered by the Investigating Officer or otherwise brought on\n\nrecord that accused Montu (appellant) had any relation or\n\nconnection with accused Inder. Even Rattan Singh, SI/SHO (PW-\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">12), who investigated the case, in his cross-examination, has stated\n\nthat during investigation he could not find any proof that the\n\naccused (appellants) were close friends or had visiting terms with\n\neach other. Therefore, the benefit of doubt is liable to be given to\n\nthe appellant Montu.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">            In view of above, we hold that the appellant Inder has\n\ncommitted an offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 302</a> IPC.\n\nHowever, we give the benefit of doubt to the appellant Montu.\n\nAccordingly, Criminal Appeal No.327-DB of 2006 is dismissed\n\nwhile Criminal Appeal No.464-DB of 2006 is allowed and the\n\nappellant Montu is acquitted of the offences for which he has been\n\ncharged.</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n\n                                      (S.S.SARON)\n                                        JUDGE\n\nNovember 25, 2008                     (SABINA)\nanita/amit                             JUDGE\n </pre>","numcites":7,"numcitedby":35,"docsource":"Punjab-Haryana High Court","citetid":93235575,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"circumstantial evidence","formInput":"circumstantial%20evidence"},{"value":"extra judicial confession","formInput":"extra%20judicial%20confession"},{"value":"section 302 ipc","formInput":"section%20302%20ipc"},{"value":"section 302 indian penal code","formInput":"section%20302%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"sec.34 ipc","formInput":"sec.34%20ipc"},{"value":"confession","formInput":"confession"},{"value":"all about adoption","formInput":"all%20about%20adoption"},{"value":"disclosure statement","formInput":"disclosure%20statement"},{"value":"section 34 indian penal code","formInput":"section%2034%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"recovery memo","formInput":"recovery%20memo"},{"value":"medico legal report","formInput":"medico%20legal%20report"},{"value":"medico legal","formInput":"medico%20legal"},{"value":"judicial confession","formInput":"judicial%20confession"},{"value":"balwant singh","formInput":"balwant%20singh"},{"value":"duli chand","formInput":"duli%20chand"},{"value":"tractors ","formInput":"tractors%20"},{"value":"Adoption  filter:  Joint family property and claim of Adoption","formInput":"Adoption%20%20filter%3A%20%20Joint%20family%20property%20and%20claim%20of%20Adoption"},{"value":" blood stains ","formInput":"%20blood%20stains%20"},{"value":"\\\"circumstantial evidence\\\"","formInput":"%5C%22circumstantial%20evidence%5C%22"},{"value":"carbon copy ","formInput":"carbon%20copy%20"}],"cats":[{"value":"murder","formInput":"tag:murder"},{"value":"common-intention","formInput":"tag:common-intention"},{"value":"examination-of-witnesses","formInput":"tag:examination-of-witnesses"},{"value":"indian-penal-code","formInput":"tag:indian-penal-code"},{"value":"criminal-procedure-code","formInput":"tag:criminal-procedure-code"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
