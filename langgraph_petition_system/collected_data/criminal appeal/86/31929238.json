These appeals arise out  of the common judgment of the  Division\n   Bench of the High Court of  Allahabad  in  Criminal  Appeal  No.4148/2007\n   along with Criminal Reference No.19/2007 by which, the High  Court  while\n   accepting the Criminal Reference  insofar  as  it  related  to  appellant\n   Sandeep in Criminal Appeal No.1651/2009, rejected the same insofar as  it\n   related to appellant Shashi Bhushan in Criminal Appeal  Nos.1425-26/2011.\n   In other words, while upholding the sentence of death awarded to Sandeep,\n   the  appellant  in  Criminal  Appeal  No.1651/2009,  the  Division  Bench\n   modified the sentence into one of life imprisonment insofar as it related\n   to Shashi Bhushan, the appellant in Criminal Appeal Nos.1425-26/2011.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">   2.       Shorn of unnecessary facts,  the  case  of  the  prosecution  as\n   projected before the trial Court was that on 17.11.2004 I D.N. Verma (PW-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">   1) along with Sub-Inspector Chander Pal Singh  (PW-2),  Constable  Rambir\n   Singh, Constable Sukhram, Constable Ashok Kumar and Driver Yashvir  Singh\n   were on patrolling duty; that when they reached ahead of Badsu on Khatoli\n   Road leading towards Falut, they met Constable Rajesh Kumar  and  another\n   Constable Ramavtar who informed PW-1 and other persons  accompanying  him\n   that one Indica car took a turn for going towards  Falut  road  and  that\n   they heard some screaming noise from that vehicle.  PW-1, accompanied  by\n   the other personnel referred to above, proceeded towards Falut  road  and\n   after a distance saw an Indica car.  They stated to have seen through the\n   focus light of the police jeep two young men trying to pull out a girl in\n   an injured condition by opening the rear door of the car.  It  is  stated\n   that it was around 21.30 hours.  The police jeep in which PW-1 and others\n   were proceeding stopped ahead of the Indica car and caught  hold  of  the\n   two young men and also noticed a girl, with injuries all  over,  on  whom\n   acid was also sprinkled.  The girl had also  sustained  injuries  on  the\n   head as well as on her right cheek.  On noticing the above, according  to\n   PW-1, when he questioned her, she responded by stating that her name  was\n   Jyoti and she is the daughter of one Baljeet Singh, R/o Lane No.16, House\n   No.56, Jagatpuri, P.S. Preet Vihar, New Delhi and that her mother’s  name\n   was Varsha whose cell number was 9871020368.  Inspector D.N. Verma (PW-1)\n   stated  to  have  gathered  information  from  her  that  she   developed\n   friendship with the appellant Sandeep while she was working in  a  mobile\n   shop.  She also stated to have revealed that she was pregnant.  According\n   to the information gathered from Jyoti, accused Sandeep had called her on\n   that evening and asked her to come to Laxmi Nagar market, Delhi, around 6\n   p.m. promising her that he will marry her  at  Haridwar.   Believing  his\n   words, she went to Laxmi Nagar market from where she was taken in  a  car\n   and that while they were moving in the  vehicle,  accused  Sandeep  asked\n   Jyoti to get the foetus aborted at Meerut, to which  she  disagreed.   On\n   this, he started beating her inside the vehicle right from the  point  of\n   Modinagar.  She stated to have further informed PW-1 and others that  she\n   told accused Sandeep that she  would  reveal  all  facts  to  his  family\n   members as well as to the police and that when the vehicle in which  they\n   were travelling turned towards an isolated place near Khatoli, they tried\n   to throw her into the sugarcane field at which point  of  time  PW-1  and\n   other police members reached the spot.  According to her  information  to\n   PW-1, accused Sandeep and Shashi Bhushan caused the injuries on her  with\n   the aid of a jack and pana (spanner) apart from cutting her with a  blade\n   and also by pouring acid on her head.  PW-1 stated that on  noticing  the\n   condition of the girl, he arranged  for  shifting  her  to  Muzaffarnagar\n   Government Hospital in the police jeep along with Constable Rambir  Singh\n   and the driver of the jeep.  It was further stated that  accused  Sandeep\n   and Shashi Bhushan, on being apprehended, also revealed their  names  and\n   informed that accused Sandeep used to visit deceased Jyoti while she  was\n   working in a mobile shop in Mayur Vihar Phase-I for the last  six  months\n   prior to the date of occurrence and developed friendship  with  her,  and\n   that in course of time, deceased Jyoti pressurized him to marry her.   On\n   the date of occurrence, around 6 p.m. he stated to have called  her  over\n   phone to meet him at Laxmi Nagar red light, that  she  responded  to  his\n   call and came to Laxmi Nagar red light where accused Sandeep was  waiting\n   along with his friend Shashi Bhushan who drove  the  vehicle  Indica  car\n   bearing registration No. DL  3CR  6666  which  belonged  to  his  mother.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">   Accused Sandeep stated to  have  extended  a  promise  to  marry  her  at\n   Haridwar.  While the vehicle started moving, accused Sandeep asked  Jyoti\n   to get the foetus aborted to which she did not agree  instead  threatened\n   him by saying that she will reveal all facts to his parents as well as to\n   the police and that as they reached Modinagar, he  started  beating  her.\n   According to the  version  of  accused  Sandeep,  as  told  to  PW-1,  at\n   Modinagar he purchased two bottles of acid and four shaving blades,  that\n   when they reached Khatoli, on seeing an isolated  place,  they  tried  to\n   pull out the injured Jyoti from the vehicle and that  at  that  point  of\n   time they were apprehended  by  the  police.   It  is  the  case  of  the\n   prosecution that while both the accused  were  taken  into  custody,  the\n   vehicle in which they were travelling was also seized along with the jack\n   and pana, four blades and two acid bottles.  The articles, namely,  blood\n   stained floor mat, empty bottles of acid, one  pair  of  ladies  footwear\n   were stated to have been seized after preparing a seizure memo.   A  copy\n   of the seizure memo was stated to have been handed over to  the  accused.\n   It is the specific case of the prosecution that since it was late in  the\n   night and it was a lonely place,  there  were  no  independent  witnesses\n   other than the police personnel.  The seizure memo was marked as  Exhibit\n   K-1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">   3.       The statement of PW-1 was registered as FIR No.Nil/2004  on  the\n   files of P.S. Ratanpuri on 17.11.2004 against both  the  accused  persons\n   for offences under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 307</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_2\">326</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_3\">324</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1535430/\" id=\"a_4\">328</a>, Indian Penal Code  (in\n   short ‘<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_5\">IPC</a>’) which came to be subsequently altered later on as one  under\n   <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_7\">34</a> IPC after the victim was declared dead  by  the  hospital\n   authorities.  On the above set of facts,  District  and  Sessions  Judge,\n   Muzaffarnagar  framed  charges  against  both  the  accused  persons  for\n   offences under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 302</a>, IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_9\">Section  34</a>,  IPC  and  <a href=\"/doc/1184459/\" id=\"a_10\">Section\n   316</a>, IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 34</a>, IPC and  proceeded  with  the  trial.   In\n   support of the prosecution as many as 10 witnesses were examined.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">   4.       When the accused persons  were  questioned  under  <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_12\">Section  313</a>,\n   Cr.P.C. for offences under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 304</a>, IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 34</a>, IPC and\n   <a href=\"/doc/1184459/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 316</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 34</a>,  IPC,  both  the  accused  pleaded  not\n   guilty and also filed a written statement  to  that  effect.   The  trial\n   Court in its judgment  dated  02.06.2007  ultimately  found  the  accused\n   persons guilty of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 302</a> read with  <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_18\">Section  34</a>,  IPC\n   and 316 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 34</a>, IPC and  after  hearing  both  the  accused\n   persons on the question of sentence, took the view that having regard  to\n   the magnitude  and  the  diabolic  manner  in  which  the  offences  were\n   committed by them and also having regard to the various  principles  laid\n   down in the decisions of this Court in relation to  the  award  of  death\n   penalty concluded that, the case on hand was one  such  case  which  fell\n   under the category of ‘rarest of rare case’ in which the accused deserved\n   to be inflicted with the capital punishment of death under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_20\">Section  302</a>,\n   IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 34</a>, IPC.  Ultimately, the trial Court convicted and\n   sentenced both the accused persons to death under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 302</a>  read  with\n   <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 34</a>, IPC apart from imposing a fine of Rs.30,000/- each  and  also\n   sentenced them to undergo 10 years rigorous imprisonment and pay  a  fine\n   of Rs.10,000/- each for offences under <a href=\"/doc/1184459/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 316</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_25\">Section  34</a>,\n   IPC and in default of payment of fine sentenced them to  undergo  further\n   rigorous  imprisonment  for  one  year.   The  sentences  were   to   run\n   concurrently.  On realization of fine from the accused persons, a sum  of\n   Rs.50,000/- was directed to be paid to the parents of the deceased  Jyoti\n   as compensation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">   5.       While hearing the  Criminal  Reference  No.19/2007  as  well  as\n   Criminal Appeal No.4148/2007 preferred by the appellants, the High  Court\n   while confirming the death penalty imposed on appellant Sandeep held that\n   the case of accused Shashi  Bhushan  was  distinguishable  and  that  the\n   gravity of the offence did not warrant infliction of  extreme  punishment\n   of death and consequently altered the same into one of  imprisonment  for\n   life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">   6.       We heard Mr.  Sushil  Kumar,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the\n   appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1651/2009 assisted by  Mr.  Daya  Krishan\n   Sharma and Mr. D.P. Chaturvedi, learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  in\n   Criminal Appeal Nos.1425-26/2011 for appellant Shashi Bhushan.   We  also\n   heard Mr. Ratnakar Dash, learned senior counsel assisted  by  Mr.  Rajeev\n   Dubey, for the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">   7.       Mr. Sushil  Kumar,  learned  senior  counsel  in  his  elaborate\n   submissions after referring to the evidence of the prosecution  witnesses\n   and medical evidence as well as expert witnesses submitted  that  the  so\n   called dying declaration of the deceased Jyoti was not proved,  that  the\n   confessional statement of the accused cannot be relied upon,  that  there\n   were very many missing links in the chain of circumstances and  therefore\n   the guilt of the accused cannot be held to be made out. According to  the\n   learned  senior  counsel  there  were  discrepancies  in  the  timing  of\n   registration of the F.I.R.,  delay  in  sending  of  the  report  to  the\n   Magistrate apart from vital contradictions in the evidence of the  police\n   witnesses.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">   8.       Learned senior counsel also contended that  there  were  serious\n   lacunae in  the  preservation  of  foetus  samples  and,  therefore,  the\n   ultimate D.N.A. test result cannot be accepted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">   9.       Learned senior counsel further contended that non-examination of\n   some of the cited witnesses caused prejudice to the accused and  on  that\n   ground also the case of the prosecution should  be  faulted.  He  further\n   contended that the case of the accused about the theft of the Indica  car\n   was not properly appreciated by the Courts below. It was  also  contended\n   that there were infirmities in regard to the recoveries  which  were  not\n   properly examined by the Courts below. Lastly, it was contended  that  it\n   was not a case for conviction and in any event not ‘rarest of rare  case’\n   for imposition of capital punishment of death sentence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">   10.      Mr. D.P. Chaturvedi, learned counsel appearing for  the  accused\n   –Shashi Bhushan apart from adopting the arguments of  Mr.  Sushil  Kumar,\n   learned senior counsel contended that out of 17 injuries alleged to  have\n   been sustained by the deceased Jyoti, at  least  7  to  8  injuries  were\n   serious and in such circumstances there would not have been any scope for\n   the deceased  Jyoti  to  have  made  any  statement  as  claimed  by  the\n   prosecution.  According  to  him  there  was  absolutely   no  overt  act\n   attributed to the accused Shashi Bhushan in the matter of  infliction  of\n   injuries on the body of the deceased Jyoti  and   consequently  even  the\n   imposition of life sentence was not warranted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">   11.      As against the above submission,  Shri  Ratnakar  Dash,  learned\n   senior counsel appearing for the State contended  that  evidence  of  the\n   prosecution witnesses who were all police personnel was  fair,  impartial\n   and natural and there was no reason to  doubt  their  version.  He  would\n   contend that when there was no independent witness present at  the  place\n   of occurrence, there was  no  question  of  examining  any  such  private\n   witness. According to him, the deceased was alive at the  time  when  the\n   accused were apprehended by the police on 17.11.2004 at  21.30  hrs.  and\n   the injuries noted by the doctor would show that the deceased was capable\n   of making a statement and, therefore, the recording of such statement  by\n   PW-1 in his complaint was perfectly in order. He further  contended  that\n   even in the statements of the accused such of those versions made by them\n   which did not in any way implicate them in  the  offence  was  admissible\n   under <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 8</a> of the Evidence Act while  the  rest  of  the  statements\n   which are likely to implicate them can be  distinguished  and  eliminated\n   from consideration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1463693\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"575647\" id=\"span_2\">12.

Learned  counsel  also  contended   that   no   prejudice   was\n   demonstratively shown by the non  examination  of  the  cited  witnesses.\n   Learned counsel contented  that  going  by  the  version  of  the  expert\n   witnesses, the preservation of the foetus was according to the prescribed\n   norms and the D.N.A. result having been proved in the manner known to law\n   cannot be doubted. He also contended that when the  registration  of  the\n   F.I.R. was promptly made, simply because there was  minor  delay  in  the\n   alteration of the offence from <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 307</a>, IPC to <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 302</a>,  IPC  and\n   the subsequent forwarding of the express report to the Magistrate  cannot\n   be fatal to the case of the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"480043\" id=\"span_3\">14.

When the submissions  made  on  behalf  of  the  appellants  are\n   analyzed, the following facts were claimed to support their stand:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        a) The entire case of the prosecution was dependent on the  version\n           of witnesses, majority of whom were police personnel  and  there\n           was no independent witness to support the version of the police.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        b) The source of the FIR was the alleged dying declaration  of  the\n           deceased which was not proved and the  so-called  confession  of\n           the accused Sandeep was inadmissible under  <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_32\">Section  25</a>  of  the\n           Evidence Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">        c) If the confession is inadmissible, the whole  case  depended  on\n           circumstantial evidence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">        d) The case which was originally registered under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 307</a>,  IPC\n           was altered into one under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 302</a>, IPC belatedly.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        e)  There  were  very  many  missing  links   in   the   chain   of\n           circumstances.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        f) There were serious infirmities in the  tests  conducted  in  the\n           samples of the foetus which seriously undermine the case of  the\n           prosecution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        g) Though the occurrence took  place  in  a  public  place  near  a\n           crusher unit where number of labourers were working, the absence\n           of examination of independent witnesses was fatal to the case of\n           the prosecution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">        h) Non-examination of some of the key witnesses cited in the charge-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">           sheet whose evidence would have otherwise supported the case  of\n           the accused caused serious prejudice and on that ground the case\n           of the prosecution should fail.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">        i) The delay in sending the express report was a serious  violation\n           of <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 157</a>, Cr.P.C. which would again vitiate  the  case  of\n           the prosecution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">        j) The alleged  seizure  of  materials  from  the  car  was  highly\n           doubtful, having regard to certain vitiating circumstances.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">        k) Accused Sandeep was roped in falsely by creating a link with his\n           mother’s car, which according to Sandeep, was stolen on the date\n           of occurrence, which was omitted to be considered in the  proper\n           perspective.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">        l) When admittedly there was a pending rape case  relating  to  the\n           deceased  in  which  certain  persons  were  accused  of  having\n           committed rape on the deceased on 17.04.2004 which  was  tacitly\n           admittedly by Baljeet Singh  (PW-8),  father  of  the  deceased,\n           there was every scope for the  aggrieved  persons  in  the  said\n           criminal  case  to  have  involved  in  the  crime  against  the\n           deceased.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">   17.      As against the above, when the stand of the learned counsel  for\n   the State is analyzed, the following points emerge for consideration:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">               i) The relationship of Sandeep (A-1) with the  deceased  and\n                  the carrying of the foetus in the womb  of  the  deceased\n                  was not in dispute.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">             ii) Merely because the key  witnesses  were  police  personnel,\n             that by itself cannot be a ground to eschew that evidence  from\n             consideration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">             iii) The case of the prosecution based on the statement of the\n                  deceased as spoken to by the witnesses cannot be doubted.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">              iv)  The statement of the deceased to the police  insofar  as\n                  it related to the incident and such of  those  admissions\n                  of the accused not implicating them to  the  offence  was\n                  admissible in evidence under <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 8</a>  and  not  hit  by\n                  <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">               v) when there were no independent witnesses present  at  the\n                  place of occurrence, the grievance of the accused on that\n                  score does not merit consideration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">              vi) The medical evidence, in particular,  injuries  noted  in\n                  the post-mortem certificate show that  the  deceased  was\n                  capable and did make the statement as demonstrated by the\n                  prosecution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">             vii) The forensic report established the presence of blood  on\n                  the weapons used as well as in the car which was  one  of\n                  the clinching circumstances to prove  the  guilt  of  the\n                  accused.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">            viii) The outcome of the DNA test established the link  of  the\n                  accused with the deceased to prove  the  motive  for  the\n                  crime.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">              ix) The claim of theft of the car was not established  before\n                  the trial Court in the manner known to law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">               x) The presence of the accused at  the  time  and  place  of\n                  occurrence was proved beyond all reasonable doubts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">              xi) The  handling  of  the  samples  sent  for  chemical  and\n                  forensic examination was carried out in  accordance  with\n                  the prescribed procedure.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">             xii)  The accused failed to show that the  non-examination  of\n                  any of the  cited  witnesses  caused  prejudice  to  them\n                  before the trial Court and, therefore, the grievance  now\n                  expressed will not vitiate the case of the prosecution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">            xiii) The various other discrepancies alleged  were  all  minor\n                  and the same do not in any way affect  the  case  of  the\n                  prosecution.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">   18.      Keeping the  above  respective  submissions  in  mind,  when  we\n   analyze the case in hand the following facts are indisputable:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">              a. The relationship of Sandeep with  deceased,  prior  to  the\n                 date of occurrence, namely, 17.11.2004 as his girlfriend;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">              b. The deceased was carrying the foetus of six months  old  in\n                 her womb;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">              c. The Indica car in which the deceased was found on the  date\n                 and time of occurrence belonged to the  mother  of  accused\n                 Sandeep;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">              d. At the time when the deceased was secured by the police  on\n                 17.11.2004 at 21.30 hours she was seriously injured but was\n                 alive;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">              e. The death of the deceased was ascertained by the  Dr.  B.S.\n                 Chaudhary (PW-6) at 10.55 p.m.\n\n              f. As per the post-mortem certificate, there were as  many  as\n                 17 injuries which were caused by blunt  weapons  like  jack\n                 and pana (spanner), shaving blades and also chemical  acid.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">              g. Police witnesses were all on patrol duty  on  the  date  of\n                 occurrence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">              h. The  DNA  test  disclosed  that  accused  Sandeep  was  the\n                 biological father of the foetus found in the  womb  of  the\n                 deceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">              i. The theory propounded by  the  accused  i.e.  the  car  was\n                 stolen on 17.11.2004 was not established before  the  trial\n                 Court in the manner known to law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_26\">              j. The statement of the accused as stated to have been made to\n                 PW-1 contained various facts unconnected to the  crime  and\n                 also  the  self  incriminating   facts   which   could   be\n                 distinguished.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">              k. The absence of any independent  witness  at  the  place  of\n                 occurrence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">   19.      Keeping the above factors, the existence of which is  borne  out\n   by acceptable legal evidence, when we examine  the  submissions  made  on\n   behalf of the appellants, in the foremost,  it  was  contended  that  the\n   deceased could not have made a statement as  claimed  by  Inspector  D.N.\n   Verma (PW-1) since according to  Constable  Ramavatar  Singh  (PW-3),  he\n   noticed acid injuries in  the  inner  mouth  of  the  deceased.   However\n   forceful the above submissions may be, we find  that  such  a  submission\n   merely based on the version of PW-3 alone cannot be  accepted.   Whatever\n   injuries sustained by the deceased were  borne  out  by  medical  record,\n   namely, post-mortem certificate and the evidence of the doctor who issued\n   the said certificate.  As many as 17 injuries were  noted  in  the  post-\n   mortem certificate.  According to the version  of  PW-3,  injury  in  the\n   mouth was caused by acid.  When we examine such of those injuries  caused\n   by acid and as spoken to by PW-6, doctor, injury Nos. 4 and 17 alone were\n   stated to have been caused by  acid.   Injury  Nos.4  and  17  have  been\n   described as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">           “4.   chemical  burn  injury  from  all  over  head,  hair  were\n                 charring and skin burnt chemically.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">           17.   Chemical burn injury all over body ranging from 12cm x 8cm\n                 to 2cm x 4 cm except upper part of chest.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">   20.      Going by the above description of the injuries, as noted by  the\n   doctor who conducted the post-mortem,  it  is  difficult  to  accept  the\n   statement of learned senior counsel for the accused that  the  injury  in\n   the mouth was such as the deceased could not have made any oral statement\n   at all to the witnesses.  It is true that by the  pouring  of  the  acid,\n   injury might have been caused on the head and other parts of the body  of\n   the deceased but by no stretch of imagination, those injuries  appear  to\n   have caused any severe damage to the mouth of the deceased, much less  to\n   the extent of preventing her from making any statement to the  witnesses.\n   In this context, when we peruse the evidence of the Doctor (PW-6), he has\n   specifically expressed an opinion that he was not in a position to  state\n   whether after receipt of injury on the body of  the  deceased  she  would\n   have been in a position to speak or not.  In other words, the doctor  who\n   had examined the injuries sustained by the deceased did not rule out  the\n   possibility of the deceased making any statement irrespective of injuries\n   sustained by her.  In this context, when we refer to the submission  made\n   on behalf of the appellants themselves before the Division Bench  of  the\n   High Court, we find that it was specifically contended that the  deceased\n   sustained multiple injuries and except one  injury,  all  other  injuries\n   were simple in nature and none of the injuries  were  sufficient  in  the\n   ordinary course of nature to cause the death of the deceased.  Therefore,\n   even going by the stand of the appellants, the condition of the deceased,\n   even after sustaining multiple injuries, was such  that  she  was  alive,\n   conscious and her death was not instantaneous.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">   21.      Having regard to the above factors, we are  convinced  that  the\n   case of prosecution that the deceased made a statement about the sequence\n   of the occurrence was really made as spelt out by the witnesses PW Nos. 1\n   to 5.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_31\">   22.      With this, we come to the next submission of learned counsel for\n   the appellants, that in the absence of independent witnesses, no reliance\n   can be placed upon PW Nos.1 to 5, who  were  all  police  personnel.   To\n   deface the evidence of PW Nos. 1 to 5, it was  contended  that  near  the\n   place of occurrence, a crusher unit was existing, and at  that  point  of\n   time, the crusher unit was also working.  It was suggested to  PW-1  that\n   the crusher unit was around 100 yards away from the place of  occurrence.\n   It was also suggested to PW-2 that the crusher unit was running  at  that\n   point of time which was 100 yards away from the place of occurrence.   In\n   another place, it was stated by PW-3 that the crusher unit was  around  ½\n   KM away from the bridge and it was working.  It was also  stated  by  him\n   that at that point of time, 3-4 persons were working in the crusher unit.\n    From what has been stated by the above witnesses, what all that  can  be\n   inferred was that a crusher unit was at least 100  yards  away  from  the\n   place of occurrence and that even at that point of time, namely, at 21.30\n   hours, the unit was working with at  least  3-4  labourers.   Beyond  the\n   above fact, it was not the case of the appellant that any worker from the\n   crusher unit was present at the spot and yet he was neither  shown  as  a\n   witness nor  examined  and  thereby  any  prejudice  was  caused  to  the\n   appellants.  It is also not the case of the appellants  that  apart  from\n   the labourers working in the crusher unit, any other independent  witness\n   was present at the spot who was not cited  nor  examined  as  a  witness.\n   Therefore, when the above facts are clear, we are at a loss to understand\n   as to how the grievance of the appellants as regards  non-examination  of\n   any independent witness can be taken as a factor to put the case  against\n   the prosecution and to hold that the whole case of the prosecution should\n   be set at naught.  Apart from the above, no other  point  was  raised  as\n   regards  the  non-examination  of  any  independent  witness  as  to  the\n   occurrence narrated by the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">   23.      One other submission made by the learned senior counsel was that\n   after finding out the cause of the occurrence from the deceased and after\n   noting that she was seriously injured,  the  police  party  arranged  for\n   shifting her to the hospital in the police jeep along with  Rambir  Singh\n   and the driver of the jeep within 2-3  minutes  and  that  there  was  no\n   justifiable ground for not examining Rambir Singh who was also cited as a\n   witness but yet not examined and also  for  the  non-examination  of  the\n   driver of the jeep.  The contention of the  learned  senior  counsel  was\n   that after shifting the deceased from the Indica car to  the  jeep  in  a\n   serious condition, the jeep would have travelled for at least an hour  or\n   so to reach the hospital and Constable Rambir Singh who  accompanied  her\n   would have been in a better position  to  state  as  to  what  transpired\n   during that period and what was heard by  him  from  the  deceased  which\n   would have thrown much light  on  the  occurrence.   The  learned  senior\n   counsel, therefore, contended that serious prejudice was  caused  to  the\n   accused by non-examination of the said Rambir Singh as well as the driver\n   whose version would have otherwise been favourable to the appellants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">   24.       Learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the  State,  however,\n   contended that in every criminal case it is not a  rule  that  all  cited\n   witnesses should be necessarily examined.  He also contended that the non-\n   examination of a witness can be  put  against  the  prosecution  if  non-\n   examination would have caused any serious prejudice to the  defence.   He\n   also relied upon the decision reported in Tej Prakash (supra) in  support\n   of his submission.  As far as the said submission is concerned,  when  we\n   examine the sequence of events, we find  that  after  gathering  whatever\n   information from the deceased, as regards the occurrence implicating  the\n   accused, which were the required details for PW-1 to lodge the  necessary\n   complaint, his immediate priority was to attend on the injured person  in\n   order to save her life.  Such a course adopted by PW-1 and  other  police\n   personnel at the place of occurrence was quite natural  and  appreciable.\n   Visualizing what had happened at the place of occurrence as  narrated  by\n   the prosecution  witnesses,  it  was  brought  out  that  whatever  basic\n   information required to ascertain the cause of occurrence was gathered by\n   the prosecution witnesses  as  disclosed  in  the  complaint,  which  was\n   registered as FIR and also as stated by the witnesses before  the  Court.\n   The contention that the examination of Constable  Rambir  Singh  and  the\n   driver of the jeep, who took the injured deceased to the hospital,  would\n   have disclosed very many other factors favourable to the accused was only\n   a wishful thinking.  In any case, what those persons would  have  deposed\n   as a witnesses and to what extent it could have been advantageous to  the\n   appellants was not even highlighted before us.  We ourselves wonder  what\n   other evidence, much less, favourble  to  the  accused  could  have  been\n   spoken to by Constable Rambir Singh who was entrusted with  the  task  of\n   admitting the injured victim in the hospital in order to  give  necessary\n   treatment for her injuries.  Since PW-1  thought  it  fit  to  shift  the\n   injured to the hospital after noticing her  serious  condition,  and  the\n   further fact that by the time they  reached  the  hospital  around  10.55\n   p.m., doctor found that the deceased was dead, it can be safely held that\n   nothing worthwhile could have been drawn  from  the  mouth  of  Constable\n   Rambir Singh or the driver of the jeep except stating that they dutifully\n   carried out the task of admitting the injured in the hospital as directed\n   by their superiors.  We, therefore, hold that the  appellants  could  not\n   demonstrate as to any prejudice that was caused by the non-examination of\n   Constable Rambir Singh and the jeep driver in order to  find  fault  with\n   the case of the prosecution on that  score.  In  this  context,  reliance\n   placed upon by the learned senior counsel for the State  in  Tej  Prakash\n   (supra) can be usefully referred to.  In para 18 of  the  said  decision,\n   this Court made it clear that all the witnesses of the  prosecution  need\n   not be called and it is sufficient if witnesses who were essential to the\n   unfolding of the narrative are examined.  Applying the said principle  to\n   the case, it can be safely held that the witnesses who were examined were\n   able to unfold the narration of events in a cogent and convincing  manner\n   and the non-examination of Constable Rambir Singh  and  the  jeep  driver\n   was, therefore, not fatal to the case of the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">   25.      Learned senior counsel for the appellants  then  contended  that\n   the appellants were not present at all at the time  of  occurrence,  that\n   the appellant Sandeep was called to the police station in furtherance  of\n   the complaint lodged by him as regards the theft of his mother’s  car  on\n   17.11.2004 and that for that purpose when he went to the police  station,\n   he was falsely implicated into the offence.  According to the appellants,\n   the deceased was already involved in a case  of  rape  committed  by  one\n   Manoj on 17.04.2004.  In  that  case,  the  complaint  preferred  by  the\n   deceased was at the stage of trial before the Court  of  Sessions  Judge.\n   It was contended that by misusing  the  stolen  car  of  the  appellant’s\n   (Sandeep) mother, the crime could have been committed  by  somebody  else\n   but unfortunately the appellants were implicated into  the  offence.   In\n   order to appreciate the said submission of the appellant-Sandeep, in  the\n   first place, when we examine the stand that his mother’s car  was  stolen\n   on 17.11.2004, we find that except the ipse dixit statement made  in  the\n   written statement to the questioning made under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 313</a>  Cr.P.C.  and\n   reference to an alleged report as regards the theft of the car, there was\n   no other fact placed before the  trial  Court.   The  trial  Court  while\n   dealing with the said contention has noted as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">          “…………the accused Sandeep filed a photo copy of the report which is\n          neither proved nor it can be taken into consideration. No FIR  has\n          been filed nor the same is proved by any  police  officials.   The\n          accused has also not examined  himself  or  any  other  person  in\n          support of his above contention.  The contention  of  the  accused\n          Sandeep that the car was stolen on 17.11.2004 from Geeta Colony is\n          totally false and frivolous. ADGC contended that father of accused\n          Sandeep is in police department posted as  Sub-Inspector  and  had\n          tried to manipulate a false story.  The recovery  of  Indica  car,\n          namely, DL 3CR 6666 on the spot  along  with  accused  persons  by\n          Inspector D.N. Verma (PW-1) of PS Ratanpuri with the injured Jyoti\n          is a very important factor which proved  the  involvement  of  the\n          accused person and strengthens the prosecution case.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">   26.      We see no reason to differ from  the  above  conclusion  of  the\n   trial Court.  If the theory of theft of Indica car is ruled out  and  the\n   presence of the car on the spot was indisputable, it should automatically\n   follow that the car could have been brought at that place along with  the\n   deceased, driven by accused Shashi Bhushan along with Sandeep only in the\n   manner narrated by the prosecution.  Apart from  merely  suggesting  that\n   the Indica car was stolen which was not fully supported  by  any  legally\n   admissible evidence, no other case was suggested by the appellants.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">    27.     When the accused Sandeep took a positive stand that he  was  not\n   present at the place of occurrence by  relying  upon  a  fact  situation,\n   namely, he was not responsible for bringing the Indica car  belonging  to\n   his mother at the place of occurrence along with the deceased, the burden\n   was heavily upon him to establish the plea that the  car  was  stolen  on\n   that very date of occurrence, namely, 17.11.2004 and, therefore, he could\n   not have brought the deceased in that car at that place.   Unfortunately,\n   by merely making a sketchy reference to the alleged theft of the  car  in\n   the written statement and the so-called complaint said to have been filed\n   with the Geeta Colony police station nothing was brought out in  evidence\n   to support that stand.  In this situation, <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 106</a>  of  the  Evidence\n   Act gets attracted.  When according to the accused, they were not present\n   at the place of occurrence, the burden was on them  to  have  established\n   the said fact since it was  within  their  special  knowledge.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"342168\" id=\"span_4\">In  this\n   context, the recent decision of this Court reported in – <a href=\"/doc/342168/\" id=\"a_40\">Prithipal  Singh\n   and Ors.

It is  impossible  for\n           the prosecution to prove certain facts particularly  within  the\n           knowledge of the  accused.   <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_42\">Section  106</a>  is  not  intended  to\n           relieve the prosecution of its burden to prove the guilt of  the\n           accused beyond reasonable doubt.

Having regard to the above  conclusion  that  the  deceased  did\n   narrate the occurrence right from the  invitation  made  by  the  accused\n   Sandeep to her over phone at 6 p.m. under the  guise  of  taking  her  to\n   Haridwar to marry her, that after she responded to the said call and  met\n   him from where she was picked up by both the accused in  the  Indica  car\n   belonging to the mother of accused Sandeep, and  the  other  sequence  of\n   events, namely, the threat posed  to  the  deceased  to  get  the  foetus\n   aborted and her refusal ultimately enraged the appellants  to  cause  the\n   assault with the weapon,  namely,  jack  and  pana,  shaving  blades  and\n   chemical acid was quite convincing and there were no good grounds to dis-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">   believe her statement.  No other motive or any other basis was  shown  to\n   disbelieve her statement.  In that respect, when we consider the reliance\n   placed upon the admissible portion of the statement of  the  accused,  we\n   are unable  to  reject  outrightly  the  entirety  of  the  statement  by\n   application of <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 25</a> of the  Evidence  Act.   According  to  learned\n   senior counsel for the appellants, the prosecution could not have  relied\n   upon the confessional statement of the accused implicating themselves  in\n   the offence alleged against them by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 25</a> of the  Evidence\n   Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">   29.      As against the  said  submission,  Mr.  Ratnakar  Dash,  learned\n   senior counsel appearing for the State rightly pointed out  that  <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_46\">Section\n   25</a> of the Evidence Act can be pressed into service  only  insofar  as  it\n   related to such of the statements that would implicate himself while  the\n   other part of the statement not relating to the crime would be covered by\n   <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 8</a> of the Evidence Act and that a distinction can always be  drawn\n   in the statement of the accused by carefully sifting the  said  statement\n   in order to identify the admission part of it as against  the  confession\n   part of it.  Learned senior counsel drew our attention to the evidence of\n   PW-1 where the said  witness  narrated  the  statement  made  by  accused\n   Sandeep which consisted of mixture of admission as  well  as  confession.\n   In that learned senior counsel pointed out that the accused Sandeep  made\n   certain statements, namely; that Jyoti was working in a  mobile  shop  in\n   Mayur Vihar, Phase I where he used to  visit;  that  during  that  period\n   around six months before he developed physical relations with  her;  that\n   the deceased Jyoti was applying pressure on him to marry  her,  and  that\n   around 6 p.m. on the date of occurrence, he called her over telephone  to\n   meet him at Laxmi Nagar red light.  He further told the witness that  the\n   Indica car bearing registration NO.DL 3CR 6666 was owned  by  his  mother\n   and that promising to marry her at Haridwar, he took the  deceased  Jyoti\n   along with him.  He also told the witness that while the car  was  moving\n   he asked the deceased Jyoti to get the foetus aborted to  which  she  did\n   not agree.  According to PW-1, Sandeep also told him  that  he  purchased\n   two bottles of acid and four blades at Modinagar, that when they  reached\n   Khatoli, he saw a road free from disturbance towards  which  the  vehicle\n   was driven and that in that place they were apprehended  by  the  police.\n   Learned senior counsel also referred to certain other statements made  by\n   Sandeep to PW-1, namely, that on that day  he  planned  with  his  friend\n   Shashi Bhushan to eliminate Jyoti from his life and that when Jyoti  told\n   him that she was going to reveal the fact of carrying his  child  in  her\n   womb to his family members and the police, he started beating  her  along\n   with his friend.  Learned senior counsel fairly  stated  that  while  the\n   last part of the statement would fall under the category  of  confession,\n   which would be hit  by  <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_48\">Section  25</a>  of  the  Evidence  Act,  the  former\n   statements which do not in any way implicate the accused to the  offence,\n   would be protected by <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 8</a> of the Evidence Act and consequently  the\n   said part of the statement was fully admissible.  We find  force  in  the\n   submission of learned senior counsel for the State.  It is  quite  common\n   that based on admissible portion of the statement of accused whenever and\n   wherever recoveries are made, the same are admissible in evidence and  it\n   is for the accused in those situations to explain to the satisfaction  of\n   the Court as to the nature of recoveries and as to  how  they  came  into\n   possession or for planting the same at the places from  where  they  were\n   recovered.  Similarly this part of the statement which does  not  in  any\n   way implicate the accused but is  mere  statement  of  facts  would  only\n   amount to mere admissions which can be relied upon for  ascertaining  the\n   other facts which are intrinsically connected with the occurrence,  while\n   at the same time, the same would not in any way result in implicating the\n   accused into the offence directly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">   30.      In that view, when we examine  the  statements  referred  to  by\n   learned senior counsel for the State  which  were  stated  to  have  been\n   uttered by the accused to PW-1, we find the first statement only  reveals\n   the fact of accused Sandeep’s  friendship  developed  with  the  deceased\n   Jyoti six months prior to the occurrence and  the  physical  relationship\n   developed by him with her.  Accepting the said statement cannot  be  held\n   to straightway implicate the accused into the crime and  consequently  it\n   cannot be construed as a confessional statement in order  to  reject  the\n   same by applying <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 25</a> of the evidence Act.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1700130\" id=\"span_6\">In  this  context  the\n   reliance placed upon the decision of this Court reported in  Bheru  Singh\n   S/o <a href=\"/doc/1700130/\" id=\"a_51\">Kalyan Singh v.

From a careful perusal of this first information  report  we\n           find that it discloses the motive for the murder and the  manner\n           in which the appellant committed the six murders. The  appellant\n           produced the blood stained sword with which according to him  he\n           committed the murders. In  our  opinion  the  first  information\n           report Ex. P-42, however is not a wholly confessional statement,\n           but only that part of it is admissible in  evidence  which  does\n           not amount to a confession and is not hit by the  provisions  of\n           <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_66\">Section  25</a>  of  the  Evidence  Act.  The  relationship  of  the\n           appellant with the deceased; the motive for  commission  of  the\n           crime and the presence of his sister-in-law PW11 do  not  amount\n           to the confession of committing any crime. Those statements  are\n           non-confessional in nature and can be used against the appellant\n           as evidence under <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 8</a> of the Evidence Act. The  production\n           and seizure of the sword by the appellant at the police station,\n           which was blood stained, is also saved by the provisions of  the\n           <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_68\">Evidence Act</a>. However, the statement that  the  sword  had  been\n           used to commit the murders as well as the manner  of  committing\n           the crime is clearly inadmissible  in  evidence.  Thus,  to  the\n           limited extent as we have noticed above and save to  the  extent\n           only the other portion of the first information report Ex.  P-42\n           must be excluded from evidence as  the  rest  of  the  statement\n           amounts to  confession  of  committing  the  crime  and  is  not\n           admissible in evidence. (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">   31.      Another submission made on behalf of  the  appellants  was  that\n   there was inordinate delay in sending the express report as  well  as  in\n   altering the offence.  The crime was initially registered  as  one  under\n   <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 307</a>, IPC and subsequently altered as one under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 302</a>,  IPC.\n   It was pointed out that immediately after registration of the  FIR  based\n   on the complaint of PW1 at 23.15  hours  on  17.11.2004,  the  crime  was\n   registered under Section 307, etc., the same came to be altered  only  on\n   20.11.2004 even though the factum  of  the  death  of  the  deceased  was\n   intimated by PW-6  on  19.11.2004  itself  by  1  p.m.   It  was  further\n   contended that the registration of the complaint after its alteration  on\n   20.11.2004, the express report was forwarded to the  Magistrate  only  on\n   25.11.2004 which was in  derogation  of  the  prescription  contained  in\n   <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 157</a>, Cr.P.C. Based on the above discrepancies, it  was  contended\n   that the purported delay was  only  to  antedate  the  FIR  to  suit  the\n   convenience of the prosecution. The submission is on the footing that the\n   prosecution developed the case for  implicating  the  accused  while  the\n   accused were not really involved in the offence and, therefore, they took\n   their own time to register the complaint.  In order to support  the  said\n   stand, learned counsel also went on to rely upon the statement of PW-1 as\n   compared to Soubir Singh (PW-5), that while PW-1 stated in  his  evidence\n   that they reached back the police station at around 23.45 hours, PW-5  in\n   whose presence the complaint was stated to have been registered mentioned\n   the time as 23.15 hours.  We do not find any serious infirmity  based  on\n   the said statement.  When the preference of the complaint by PW-1 and its\n   registration cannot be  doubted  in  the  absence  of  any  flaw  in  its\n   preference and registration, minor difference in the timing mentioned  by\n   the witnesses cannot be taken so very seriously to  hold  that  the  very\n   registration of the complaint was doubtful.  In fact PW-1  in  his  chief\n   examination in another place has also referred to the registration of the\n   FIR at 23.15 hours though the appellants counsel wanted to  rely  on  the\n   statement of the said witness to the effect that they  all  reached  back\n   the police station at around 23.45 hours.  Apparently, there  appears  to\n   be some mistake in recording the timing as stated  by  PW-1.   Therefore,\n   nothing turns much on the said submission  of  learned  counsel  for  the\n   appellants.  As far as the contention that there was  considerable  delay\n   in altering the offence from <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 307</a>, IPC to  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_73\">Section  302</a>,  IPC  was\n   concerned the said submission was made by referring to  the  evidence  of\n   the Doctor (PW-6) who conducted the post-mortem that  by  10.55  p.m.  on\n   17.11.2004 itself the death of the deceased was confirmed when the victim\n   was admitted to the hospital which was also  known  to  Constable  Rambir\n   Singh who accompanied the victim to the hospital.  It  was  also  pointed\n   out that PW-6 sent the intimation about the death of the deceased to  the\n   police station at 23.10 hours while keeping the body in the mortuary.  To\n   the above submission, on behalf  of  the  State,  it  was  sought  to  be\n   explained that even though the  death  intimation  was  dated  17.11.2004\n   itself, since the post-mortem was held only on 19.11.2004 and  the  post-\n   mortem report was received on 20.11.2004 the offence came to  be  altered\n   based  on  the  post-mortem  report  on  20.11.2004.   Though  the   said\n   explanation cannot be said to be fully satisfactory, it will have  to  be\n   stated that when there was no serious infirmity in  the  registration  of\n   the FIR based on the complaint on 17.11.2004 (i.e.) immediately after the\n   occurrence and every follow-up action was being  taken  meticulously,  we\n   hold that such a minor discrepancy in the timing  of  alteration  of  the\n   crime by itself  cannot be held to be so  very  serious  to  suspect  the\n   registration of the crime or go to the extent of holding that  there  was\n   any deliberate attempt on the part of the prosecution to  ante  date  the\n   FIR for that purpose.  We have already held that  the  accused  miserably\n   failed to substantiate the stand that he was not present at the  spot  of\n   occurrence  whereas  he  was  really  apprehended  on  the  spot  by  the\n   prosecution witnesses and was brought to the  police  station  from  whom\n   other recoveries were made.   The  submission  by  referring  to  certain\n   insignificant facts relating to the delay  in  the  alteration  of  crime\n   cannot be held to be so very fatal to the case of the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"15880\" id=\"span_8\">32.      It was also feebly contended on behalf of  the  appellants  that\n   the express report was not forwarded  to  the  Magistrate  as  stipulated\n   under  <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_74\">Section  157</a>,  Cr.P.C.  instantaneously.    According  to  learned\n   counsel FIR which was initially registered  on  17.11.2004  was  given  a\n   number on 19.11.2004 as  FIR  No.116  of  2004  and  it  was  altered  on\n   20.11.2004 and was forwarded only on 25.11.2004 to  the  Magistrate.   As\n   far as the said contention is concerned, we only wish  to  refer  to  the\n   reported decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/15880/\" id=\"a_75\">Pala Singh and  Another  v.  State  of\n   Punjab</a> - AIR 1972 SC 2679 wherein this Court has clearly held that  where\n   the FIR was actually recorded without delay and the investigation started\n   on the basis of that FIR and there is no other infirmity brought  to  the\n   notice of the Court then, however improper or objectionable the delay  in\n   receipt of the report by the Magistrate concerned, in the absence of  any\n   prejudice to the accused it cannot by itself justify the conclusion  that\n   the investigation was tainted and  prosecution  insupportable.   Applying\n   the above ratio to the case on hand, while pointing out the delay in  the\n   forwarding of the FIR to the Magistrate, no prejudice was  said  to  have\n   been caused to the appellants by virtue of the said delay.  As far as the\n   commencement of the investigation  is  concerned,  our  earlier  detailed\n   discussion discloses that there was no dearth in that  aspect.   In  such\n   circumstances we do not find any infirmity in the case of prosecution  on\n   that score.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"320833\" id=\"span_9\">In fact <a href=\"/doc/15880/\" id=\"a_76\">the above  decision</a>  was  subsequently  followed  in\n   <a href=\"/doc/320833/\" id=\"a_77\">Sarwan Singh &amp; Others v. State of  Punjab</a> (AIR 1976 SC  2304),  Anil  Rai\n   vs. State of Bihar (2001 Supp.</span> 1 SCR 298) and Aqeel Ahmad vs.  State   of\n   U.P. -  (2008) 17  SCR 1330.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">   33.      Another submission made on behalf  of  the  appellant  was  that\n   there were serious infirmities in preserving and testing of the sample of\n   the foetus and the consequent DNA report implicating the accused  Sandeep\n   to the destruction of the foetus whose biological father was found to  be\n   the accused himself.  The infirmity pointed out was that  the  sample  of\n   the foetus of the child was taken as early as on 17.11.2004 while it  was\n   sent for forensic lab only on 25.01.2005 and that since there was a  long\n   gap in between, the prosecution ought to have disclosed  as  to  how  the\n   samples were properly preserved in order to  ensure  proper  test  to  be\n   conducted for ascertaining the correctness of its outcome.   Though  such\n   submission was made with some emphasis, it was not pointed out as to what\n   was the nature of procedure to be followed in regard to the  preservation\n   of the samples taken apart from what was followed in taking  the  samples\n   by the prosecution.  It is not in dispute  that  at  the  time  of  post-\n   mortem, when the foetus was discovered, the same was preserved by  taking\n   two samples one in the  Formalin  solution  and  the  other  one  by  ice\n   preservation.  It is borne out by record that there  was  an  FSL  report\n   dated 5.1.2005 as per which the SSP of Muzaffarnagar  was  informed  that\n   the foetus which was preserved in  Formalin  solution  was  not  accepted\n   since laboratory had no standard protocol for extracting the  amplifiable\n   DNA of Formalin preserved tissues.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">   34.      Therefore, in the evidence of PW-10 Junior Scientific Officer of\n   Central Forensic Laboratory, Chandigarh, it  was  brought  out  that  the\n   blood samples of accused Sandeep  and  the  foetus  received  by  him  on\n   27.01.2005 and that necessary test was conducted based on which a  report\n   on 13B/1, 13A/2 and 13C/3 were forwarded which confirmed that the accused\n   Sandeep was the biological father of the foetus.  He  also  confirmed  in\n   the cross examination that the earlier  sample  of  foetus  preserved  in\n   Formalin solution  received  on  05.01.2005  was  returned  back  without\n   opening the seal as the same was kept in Formalin solution  and  standard\n   protocol analysis was  not  available  in  the  laboratory.   He  further\n   confirmed that when the sample on second time was received along with the\n   letter dated 25.1.2005, the same was preserved in  ice  separately  which\n   they were able to test in their laboratory for finding  out  the  result.\n   It has also  come  in  his  evidence  that  the  collection  of  samples,\n   preservation of samples and transportation of samples  if  not  carefully\n   done, it may affect the result, but  in  the  case  on  hand  the  result\n   reported by him was not based on wrong facts.  In the light of  the  said\n   expert evidence of the Junior Scientific Officer it is too  late  in  the\n   day for the appellant-Sandeep to contend that  improper  preservation  of\n   the foetus would have resulted in a wrong report to the effect  that  the\n   accused Sandeep was found to be  the  biological  father  of  the  foetus\n   received from  the  deceased  Jyoti.   As  the  said  submission  is  not\n   supported by any relevant material on record and as the appellant was not\n   able  to  substantiate  the  said  argument  with  any  other  supporting\n   material, we do not find any  substance  in  the  said  submission.   The\n   circumstance, namely, the report of the  DNA  in  having  concluded  that\n   accused Sandeep was the biological father  of  the  recovered  foetus  of\n   Jyoti was one other relevant circumstance to prove the guilt of the  said\n   accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">   35.      There were certain other  submissions  made  on  behalf  of  the\n   appellants, namely, the seizure of materials from  the  car  were  highly\n   doubtful etc. We do not find any serious lacunae pointed out  in  support\n   of the said submissions.  As rightly submitted on behalf of  the  learned\n   senior counsel for the State, the discrepancies were minor  in  character\n   and we do not find any serious infirmity based on the said  discrepancies\n   argued on behalf of the accused/appellants.  In the light  of  the  above\n   conclusion, we find that the chain of circumstances alleged  against  the\n   appellants  was  conclusively  proved  without  any  missing  link.   We,\n   therefore, do not find any scope to interfere with the conviction arrived\n   at against the appellants by the trial Court as confirmed by the Division\n   Bench of the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">   36.      We, therefore, do not find  any  scope  to  interfere  with  the\n   sentence of life and  other  sentences  imposed  against  accused  Shashi\n   Bhushan under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 302</a>, IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_79\">Section  34</a>,  IPC  by  the  High\n   Court and the other sentences under Section 316 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 34</a> IPC.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1460234\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"996091\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"989335\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"307021\" id=\"span_13\">37.      When we come to the question of sentence of death as imposed  by\n   learned Sessions Judge, which was also confirmed by the Division Bench as\n   against the accused Sandeep, the same will have to  be  examined  in  the\n   light of the principles laid down in the various decisions of this  Court\n   right from <a href=\"/doc/307021/\" id=\"a_81\">Bachan Singh v.

The rarest of rare case” comes when a convict would  be  a\n       menace and threat to the harmonious and peaceful coexistence of  the\n       society.  The crime may be heinous or brutal but may not be  in  the\n       category of “the rarest of the rare case”.  There must be no  reason\n       to believe that the accused cannot be reformed or rehabilitated  and\n       that he is likely to continue criminal acts  of  violence  as  would\n       constitute a continuing threat to the society.  The accused may be a\n       menace to the society and would continue to be so,  threatening  its\n       peaceful and harmonious coexistence.  The manner in which the  crime\n       is committed must be such that it may result in intense and  extreme\n       indignation of the community and shock the collective conscience  of\n       the society.  Where an accused does  not  act  on  any  spur-of-the-\n       moment provocation and indulges himself in  a  deliberately  planned\n       crime and meticulously executes it, the death sentence  may  be  the\n       most appropriate punishment for such a  ghastly  crime.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"996091\" id=\"span_16\">The  death\n       sentence may be warranted where the victims  are  innocent  children\n       and helpless women.  Thus, in case the crime is committed in a  most\n       cruel and inhuman manner which is  an  extremely  brutal,  grotesque\n       diabolical, revolting and dastardly manner, where  his  act  affects\n       the entire moral fibre of the society e.g. crime committed for power\n       of political ambition or indulging in organized criminal activities,\n       death sentence should be awarded.”\n\n    It is, therefore, well-settled that awarding of life  sentence  is  the\n    rule, death is an exception.  The application of the  ‘rarest  of  rare\n    case’ principle is dependant  upon  and  differs  from  case  to  case.\n    However, the principles laid down earlier and restated in  the  various\n    decisions of this Court <a href=\"/doc/996091/\" id=\"a_87\">referred to above</a> can be broadly stated that in\n    a deliberately planned  crime,  executed  meticulously  in  a  diabolic\n    manner, exhibiting inhuman conduct in a  ghastly  manner  touching  the\n    conscience of everyone and thereby  disturb  the  moral  fibre  of  the\n    society would call for imposition of capital  punishment  in  order  to\n    ensure that it acts as a deterrent. While we  are  convinced  that  the\n    case of the prosecution based on the evidence displayed, confirmed  the\n    commission of offence by the appellants, without any iota of doubt,  we\n    are of the considered opinion, that still the case does not fall within\n    the four corners of the principle of the ‘rarest  of  the  rare  case’.\n    However, considering the plight of the hapless young lady, who  fell  a\n    victim to the avaricious conduct and lust of the appellant Sandeep, the\n    manner in which the life of the deceased was snatched away  by  causing\n    multiple injuries all over the body  with  all  kinds  of  weapons,  no\n    leniency can be shown to the said appellant.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"989335\" id=\"span_17\">In the decision  reported\n    in <a href=\"/doc/989335/\" id=\"a_88\">Swamy Sharaddananda</a> (supra) even while setting aside the sentence of\n    death penalty and awarding the life imprisonment, it was explained that\n    in order to serve ends of justice, the appellant therein should not  be\n    released from the prison till the end of his life.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"193135057\" id=\"span_18\">Likewise, in <a href=\"/doc/193135057/\" id=\"a_89\">Ramraj\n    v.
