The question for our consideration is whether there  is  any  evidence\nthat would warrant setting aside the conviction of  the  appellants  by  the\nTrial Court and affirmed by the High Court. In our opinion,  the  answer  is\nin the negative and we uphold  the  conviction  of  the  appellants  for  an\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 302</a> of the  Indian  Penal  Code  read  with\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 34</a> thereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">The facts:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.    On 20th May, 1995  at  about  7.15  p.m.  Tara  Chand,  Station  House\nOfficer in Police Station Nokha, District Bikaner in  Rajasthan  received  a\ncryptic telephonic message.  The message was from an unknown person and  was\nto the effect that in Ward No.2 in village Nokha, Ram Pratap and  Sohan  Lal\n(PW-4) who are real brothers were involved in a fight.  Several  others  had\njoined in and firearms, lathis, barchis and other weapons were used  in  the\nfight.  It was also informed that two persons had died in the incident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.    Tara Chand reduced the information in writing in a roznamcha and  then\nreached the place of occurrence along with some other police officers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.    At the place of occurrence, Sohan Lal gave  a  parcha  bayan  to  Tara\nChand at about 8.30 p.m.  Sohan Lal stated that his brother  Genaram  (PW-1)\nhad installed a dharam kanta or a weighbridge on Roda Road  and  about  five\nyears later Ram Pratap also installed a weighbridge on the same road.  As  a\nresult of the installation  of  the  second  weighbridge,  the  relationship\nbetween Genaram and Ram Pratap was not cordial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">6.    Sohan Lal further stated that sometime  between  6.30  p.m.  and  6.45\np.m., he and Om Prakash (PW-3 – son of Genaram) were  sitting  in  a  temple\nnear his (Sohan Lal’s) house.  At  that  time  his  two  sons,  namely,  Ram\nNarain  (hereafter  referred  to  as  deceased  Ram  Narain)  and   Mohanlal\n(hereafter referred to as deceased Mohanlal) came out of his house and  went\ntowards Ram Pratap’s house.  When  they  were  near  his  house,  they  were\nattacked by the four appellants, that is, Bastiram,  Mohan  Lal,  Ramnarayan\nand  Banwari.   These  four  appellants  were  armed  with  pistols.    Also\nparticipating in the attack were  Mangilal,  Ramjus,  Hariram,  Ram  Pratap,\nBhagwanaram and Maniram who were armed with either a barchi or a jayee or  a\nsela.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.    Sohan Lal further stated that his two sons, deceased  Ram  Narain  and\ndeceased Mohanlal, were surrounded by the ten persons aforesaid who  made  a\nhue and cry that they should be killed.   Thereupon  Om  Prakash  and  Sohan\nLal’s two  other  sons,  namely,  Rameshwarlal  (hereafter  referred  to  as\ndeceased Rameshwarlal) and Rajaram (PW-10) rushed towards the site.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">8.    It was further stated by Sohan Lal that  appellant  Banwari  fired  at\ndeceased  Mohanlal;  appellant  Bastiram  fired  at  deceased  Rameshwarlal;\nappellant Ramnarayan fired at injured Rajaram and appellant Mohan Lal  fired\nat deceased Ram Narain.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">9.    Sohan Lal also stated that deceased Mohanlal died on  the  spot  while\ninjured Rajaram, Ram Narain and Rameshwarlal were taken to a  hospital.  Ram\nNarain and Rameshwarlal later succumbed to their injuries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">10.   Before his death on 22nd May, 1995 deceased Rameshwarlal gave a  dying\ndeclaration  on  21st  May,  1995.  In  his   dying   declaration   deceased\nRameshwarlal stated that  appellant  Bastiram  had  fired  at  deceased  Ram\nNarain who died on the spot.  He stated that appellant Bastiram  also  fired\nat deceased  Mohanlal  and  appellant  Mohan  Lal  fired  at  him  (deceased\nRameshwarlal). Deceased Rameshwarlal  also  stated  that  appellant  Banwari\nfired at Maniram and that his brother Goverdhan also arrived  at  the  scene\nand Maniram Patwari fired at him.   The  dying  declaration  is  clearly  at\nvariance with the parcha bayan of Sohan Lal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">11.   That Maniram (from Ram Pratap’s group) died on  the  spot  is  not  in\ndispute. In this regard, we were given a copy  of  the  judgment  and  order\ndated 7th September, 2001 in Sessions Case No. 21 of 2001 wherein the  State\nhad accused Sohan Lal and members of his group of  having  murdered  Maniram\nand causing injuries to others.  In the decision,  Sohan  Lal  and  all  the\nmembers of his group were acquitted by giving them  the  benefit  of  doubt.\nThat decision seems to have attained finality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">Decision of the Trial Court:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">12.   On these broad facts the four appellants and the  other  five  persons\nfrom Ram Pratap’s group were tried for various  offences  under  the  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">Indian\nPenal Code</a>.  The Additional Sessions Judge (Fast  Track)  Bikaner  delivered\nhis judgment in Sessions Case No.24/2001 on 7th September, 2001 in which  he\nheld the appellants guilty, inter  alia,  of  an  offence  punishable  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 302</a>  read  with  <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_5\">Section  34</a>  of  the  IPC  and  sentenced  them  to\nimprisonment for life and fine. They  were  also  convicted  of  an  offence\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 307</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 34</a> of the IPC  and  sentenced\nto rigorous imprisonment for five years  and  fine.  The  remaining  accused\nwere acquitted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">13.   The Trial Court found that  there  were  four  eye  witnesses  to  the\noccurrence, namely, Om Prakash (PW-3), Sohan Lal (PW-4), Jagdish (PW-9)  and\nRajaram (PW-10). This was not questioned before the High Court and  was  not\ndisputed before us also.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">14.   The Trial Judge held that  appellant  Banwari  had  caused  a  firearm\ninjury to deceased Mohanlal resulting in  his  death;  appellant  Ramnarayan\nhad caused a firearm injury to Rajaram and appellant Bastiram had  caused  a\nfirearm injury to deceased Rameshwarlal resulting  in  his  death.   It  was\nfound that amongst other injuries, deceased Ram Narain had  received  a  gun\nfire injury on his thigh.   It  was  held  that  the  gun  fire  injury  was\ninflicted by appellant Mohan Lal.  The Trial  Judge  noted  that  the  post-\nmortem report of deceased Ram Narain revealed  that  there  was  no  firearm\ninjury on his body, but he preferred to rely on  the  eye  witness  evidence\nrather than on the medical report.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">15.   The Trial Judge did not place any reliance on  the  dying  declaration\ngiven by deceased Rameshwarlal, since it  did  not  bear  a  certificate  of\nfitness given by the doctor at the time of its recording.  The  Trial  Judge\nnoted that the contents of the dying declaration were at variance  with  the\ncontents of the parcha bayan given by Sohan Lal and  that  there  were  some\ndiscrepancies in the  dying  declaration  which  could,  therefore,  not  be\ndepended upon for its truthfulness. However, the Trial Judge noted that  the\ndying declaration was evidence for the presence of  the  appellants  at  the\nplace of occurrence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">16.   The appellants produced their  defence  evidence.  Appellant  Bastiram\nproduced evidence to the effect that on the fateful  day,  he  had  gone  to\nBikaner in his capacity as Patwari in Nokha village at  about  11  a.m.   He\nreached Bikaner at  about  1  p.m.  and  met  several  people  not  only  in\nconnection with his official work but also in connection with a State  level\nconference of Patwar Sangh to be held on 8-9 June, 1995 at Alwar.   He  left\nBikaner at about 7.30 p.m. and returned to Nokha  at  about  9.30  p.m.   As\nsuch, he was not present when the incident took place.  Some of the  persons\nwhom appellant Bastiram met at Bikaner were produced  as  defence  witnesses\nincluding Phoola Ram (DW-1) who stated that  after  meeting  him,  appellant\nBastiram left for the house of Gopal Krishan at about 5.45 p.m;   Mangi  Lal\n(DW-2) stated that appellant Bastiram  was with him and at about  5.30  p.m.\nhe went away with Phoola Ram. Gopal Krishan  (DW-3)  stated  that  appellant\nBastiram had come to his house at about 6 p.m. on 20th May,  1995  and  left\nat about 6.30 p.m. Inder Chand (DW-7) stated that between 5.30  and  6  p.m.\nappellant Bastiram met  Hanuman  Singh,  Sub  Divisional  Magistrate,  South\nBikaner. Hanuman Singh (DW-9) stated that appellant  Bastiram  had  come  to\nhis chamber with Inder Chand at  about  5.15  or  5.30  p.m.  in  regard  to\norganizing a farewell party on his (Hanuman Singh’s) transfer. Jagdish  (DW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">10) is the son of Gopal Krishan and he stated that  appellant  Bastiram  had\ncome to his father’s house at about 6 p.m. on 20th May, 1995 and  he  stayed\nthere for about half an hour.  Jagdish also stated that he had gone  to  see\noff appellant Bastiram at Ambedkar Circle.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">17.   Rajender Kumar Sharma appeared in the witness box as  DW-11.   He  was\nworking  as  Civil  Judge  (Junior  Division)  and  Judicial  Magistrate  at\nBikaner.  He stated that he had recorded the dying declaration  of  deceased\nRameshwarlal on 21st May, 1995.  He also stated that  before  recording  the\ndying declaration a Fitness Certificate was  obtained  from  the  doctor  on\nduty which is mentioned at ‘E’ to ‘F’  in  the  dying  declaration.  In  his\ncross-examination this witness stated that deceased Rameshwarlal was fit  to\nmake a statement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">18.   Umesh Joshi  (DW-12)  was  working  as  Additional  Superintendent  of\nPolice, CID (CB) in Jaipur.  He had conducted  investigations  in  the  case\nand had sent a Factual Report to the Superintendent of Police  of  CID  (CB)\nRajasthan, Jaipur in which he  opined  that  the  involvement  of  appellant\nBastiram in the occurrence had not been established.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">19.   Similarly, appellant Mohan Lal  also  produced  defence  witnesses  to\nprove that he was not at the place of occurrence on  the  fateful  day.  The\nevidence led by both these appellants was considered by the Trial Judge  but\nrejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">Decision of the High Court:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">20.   Feeling aggrieved by their conviction  and  sentence,  the  appellants\npreferred Criminal Appeal No.798 of 2001 in the Rajasthan High  Court  while\nthe State of Rajasthan preferred Criminal Appeal No.528 of 2002 against  the\nacquittal of the other five accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">21. By a judgment and order dated 9th September, 2003 the High Court  upheld\nthe conviction of the four appellants and dismissed the appeal filed by  the\nState of Rajasthan against the  acquittal  of  the  remaining  five  accused\npersons.[1]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">22.   The High Court confirmed the conclusions of the Trial  Judge.  It  was\nheld that appellant Bastiram had caused a  firearm  injury  leading  to  the\ndeath of Rameshwarlal; appellant Banwari had also caused  a  firearm  injury\nleading to the death of Mohanlal; appellant Mohan Lal had caused  a  firearm\ninjury on the thigh of deceased Ram  Narain  and  appellant  Ramnarayan  had\ncaused a firearm injury on Rajaram.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1140491\" id=\"span_1\">23.   The High Court was of the view that even though the  medical  evidence\nshowed that deceased Ram Narain had  not  received  a  firearm  injury,  the\nocular evidence  to  the  contrary  was  to  be  preferred  since  that  was\nreliable.  Reliance  was  placed  on  <a href=\"/doc/1140491/\" id=\"a_8\">Suraj  Pal   v.   State   of   U.P.</a>[2]\nAlternatively, it was  held  that  even  if  deceased  Ram  Narain  had  not\nreceived any gunshot injury, the fact is that appellant Mohan Lal was  armed\nwith a pistol and it could safely be  concluded  that  he  shared  a  common\nintention with the other  accused persons thereby attracting <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_9\">Section  34</a>  of\nthe IPC for the  purposes  of  confirming  his  conviction  for  an  offence\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 302</a> of the IPC.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">24.   The four appellants filed three appeals in this Court  being  Criminal\nAppeal No.758 of 2004, Criminal Appeal No.759 of 2004  and  Criminal  Appeal\narising out of S.L.P.  (Crl.) No. 5240 of 2004.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">Presence of appellant Bastiram:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">25.   Insofar as the appeal filed by appellant Bastiram  is  concerned,  the\nprincipal submission before us was to the effect that there is a  reasonable\ndoubt whether he was at all involved in the incident.  Several factors  were\nbrought to our notice in this regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\"> 26.  Firstly, it was submitted that the evidence  given  by  the  four  eye\nwitnesses suggests  that  appellant  Bastiram  shot  deceased  Rameshwarlal.\nHowever, in his dying declaration deceased Rameshwarlal does  not  say  that\nhe was shot by appellant Bastiram.   According  to  the  dying  declaration,\ndeceased Ram  Narain  was  shot  by  appellant  Bastiram  and  he  (deceased\nRameshwarlal) received a gunshot injury from appellant Mohan Lal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">27.   The Trial  Judge  partially  rejected  deceased  Rameshwarlal’s  dying\ndeclaration because it was  too  much  at  variance  with  the  eye  witness\naccount and it was doubtful whether he was fit to  make  a  statement.   The\ndying declaration was accepted only for the purpose that  it  confirmed  the\npresence of the appellants including appellant  Bastiram  at  the  place  of\noccurrence.  We do not see any perversity in this conclusion  of  the  Trial\nJudge, confirmed by the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">28.   Secondly, it was submitted  that  during  the  investigation,  a  fact\nfinding report was tendered by Umesh Joshi (DW-12) to the Superintendent  of\nPolice of CID (CB) Rajasthan, Jaipur  and  it  was  marked  as  Exhibit  ‘D-\n51’.The report concludes that the involvement of appellant Bastiram  in  the\nincident was not proved.   It  was  submitted  that  this  exhibit  was  not\nconsidered either by the Trial Court or by the High Court  while  convicting\nappellant Bastiram.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">29.   The fact finding report is only another piece of evidence and  it  has\nto be read along with the statement of the defence witnesses  which  clearly\nbrings out, and this has not been doubted, that appellant  Bastiram  had  in\nfact gone to Bikaner on that day for some official work.  The only  question\nwas about the approximate time when he left  Bikaner  to  return  to  Nokha.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_36\">30.   On the basis of the statements made by the  defence  witnesses  it  is\nnot possible to accurately state when appellant Bastiram left  Bikaner,  but\nhe was certainly there till about 5.00 or 5.15 p.m. if not a  little  later.\nInformation about the incident at  Nokha  was  received  by  Tara  Chand  in\nPolice Station Nokha at about 7.15 p.m. meaning thereby  that  the  incident\nhad taken place a short while before that.  As per the  parcha  bayan  given\nby Sohan Lal the incident took place between 6.30 and 6.45  p.m.   There  is\ntherefore a window of about  one  hour  and  thirty  or  forty-five  minutes\nbetween the time of appellant Bastiram’s  departure  from  Bikaner  and  his\narrival at Nokha.  It is, therefore, quite possible, given  the  flexibility\nof time and a lack of exactitude that appellant Bastiram  was  present  when\nthe incident took place and as testified by the eye witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">31.   The Trial Court rejected the evidence of the  defence  witnesses  with\nregard to the absence of  appellant  Bastiram  on  three  grounds:  Firstly,\nthere was no occasion for him to remain in Bikaner after office hours,  that\nis, after 5.00 p.m.  This may not  be  a  good  enough  reason  per  se  for\nrejecting  the  testimony  of  the  defence  witnesses.  But  a   reasonable\nconclusion can be drawn  on  the  basis  of  the  material  on  record  that\nappellant Bastiram was in Bikaner till about 5.00 or 5.15 p.m. but  this  is\nof no consequence.  Secondly, the Trial Court also noted some  discrepancies\nin the evidence of the defence witnesses with regard to  the  timings  given\nby the various defence witnesses. These  are  minor  discrepancies  and,  as\nrightly noted by the Trial Court, no person keeps an eye  on  the  clock  or\nnotes the time of meeting. It is for this reason that  some  flexibility  in\nthe timings must be  given.   Thirdly,  since  appellant  Bastiram  was  the\nPresident of the Patwar Sangh  at  Nokha  and  the  defence  witnesses  were\neither Patwaris or related to the  Revenue  Department,  appellant  Bastiram\ncould have influenced them on account of being a leader. This may be a  real\npossibility considering the fact that though appellant  Bastiram  was  named\nin the parcha bayan as one of those armed with a pistol and who  caused  the\ndeath of deceased Rameshwarlal, he was in fact  arrested  about  two  and  a\nhalf years  later  on  21st  January,  1998.  Cumulatively  considered,  the\nreasons given by the Trial Judge for rejecting the testimony of the  defence\nwitnesses are adequate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">32.   In any event, what  is  perhaps  more  important  is  the  cogent  and\nconsistent eye witness testimony  relating  to  the  presence  of  appellant\nBastiram.  This  cannot  be  simply  discarded  on  the  basis  of  possible\nguesswork by the defence witnesses about the timings of  the  meetings  that\nappellant Bastiram had in Bikaner. In this regard, the conduct of  appellant\nBastiram  is  also  significant.  He  produced  a  copy  of  his  travelling\nallowance bill and daily diary which showed that he left  Bikaner  at  about\n7.30 p.m.  The Trial Judge noted that both  these  documents  were  prepared\nafter the incident and in the daily diary  (Exhibit  D-52)  it  is  recorded\nthat appellant Bastiram met Hanuman Singh (DW-9) in connection with a  party\nand left Bikaner at about 7.30 p.m. and arrived at Nokha at 9.30 p.m.   None\nof the defence witnesses support the case  of  appellant  Bastiram  that  he\nleft Bikaner at  7.30  p.m.  It  is  quite  clear  that  appellant  Bastiram\nmanufactured this evidence with a view to cover his tracks  when  there  was\nno need for him to do so, assuming his witnesses were speaking the truth.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\"> 33.  Under the circumstances, on a consideration of the evidence on  record\nthere is no doubt that appellant Bastiram  was  present  when  the  incident\noccurred and, as stated by the eye witnesses, participated in  it.   We  see\nno reason to upset the concurrent finding of fact  in  this  regard  by  the\nTrial Court and the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">Other appellants:\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">34.   There is also overwhelming evidence given by the eye  witnesses  about\nthe use of  firearms  by  appellant  Ramnarayan,  appellant  Mohan  Lal  and\nappellant Banwari.  The evidence of the eye witnesses  in  regard  to  these\nappellants is consistent and we see no reason to differ with the  concurrent\nfindings arrived at by the Trial Court as well as  the  High  Court.  Little\nwas said by learned counsel disputing their involvement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">35.   It was submitted that Maniram, one of the  persons  belonging  to  Ram\nPratap’s group was also killed in the incident and there is  no  explanation\nfor the cause of his death.  It was submitted that it is necessary  for  the\nprosecution to explain any injuries sustained by the accused party.  Nothing\nfurther need be said on this in view of the benefit of doubt,  as  mentioned\nabove, given to Sohan Lal’s group in Sessions Case No.  21  of  2001.

Finally, it was submitted that according to  the  post  mortem  report\nand the evidence given by the doctor no firearm  injury  was  found  on  the\nbody of deceased Ram Narain.   However,  the  ocular  testimony  is  to  the\neffect that deceased Ram Narain was shot at by appellant Mohan Lal  injuring\nhim and thereby causing his death. It was submitted  that  the  Trial  Judge\nand  the  High  Court  erroneously  gave  primacy  to  the  ocular  evidence\ndisregarding the medical evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"151465151\" id=\"span_2\">37.   The question before us, therefore, is whether the  “medical  evidence”\nshould be believed or whether the testimony of the eye witnesses  should  be\npreferred. There is no doubt that ocular evidence should be accepted  unless\nit is completely negated by the medical  evidence.[3]   This  principle  has\nmore recently been accepted in <a href=\"/doc/151465151/\" id=\"a_11\">Gangabhavani v. Rajapati Venkat Reddy</a>.[4]</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"720083\" id=\"span_3\">38.   The expression “medical evidence” compendiously refers to the\n\n\n\nfacts stated by the doctor either in  the  injury  report  or  in  the  post\nmortem report or during his oral testimony plus  the  opinion  expressed  by\nthe doctor on the basis of the facts stated. For example, an injury  on  the\nskull or the leg is a fact  recorded  by  the  doctor.  Whether  the  injury\ncaused the death of the person is the opinion of the  doctor.  As  noted  in\n<a href=\"/doc/720083/\" id=\"a_12\">State of Haryana v. Bhagirath</a>[5] on the same set of facts, two  doctors  may\nhave a different opinion. Therefore, the opinion of a particular  doctor  is\nnot final or sacrosanct.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">39.   What about the facts recorded by a doctor – are  they  sacrosanct?  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1414007\" id=\"span_4\">In\n<a href=\"/doc/1414007/\" id=\"a_13\">Kapildeo Mandal v. State of Bihar</a>[6] the facts  found  by  the  doctor  were\npreferred over the eye witness testimony. The ocular  evidence  was  to  the\neffect that the deceased suffered  firearm  injuries.  However,  the  doctor\nconducting the post mortem examination stated  that  he  did  not  find  any\nindication of any firearm injury on the person of the deceased. No  pellets,\nbullets or any cartridge were found in any  of  the  wounds.  Accepting  the\n“medical evidence” on facts, it was observed that,\n\n           “[T]he medical evidence is to the  effect  that  there  were  no\n           firearm injuries on  the  body  of  the  deceased,  whereas  the\n           eyewitnesses’  version  is  that  the   appellant-accused   were\n           carrying firearms and the injuries were caused by the  firearms.\n           In such a situation and circumstance, the medical evidence  will\n           assume importance while appreciating the  evidence  led  by  the\n           prosecution by the court and will have priority over the  ocular\n           version  and  can  be  used  to  repel  the  testimony  of   the\n           eyewitnesses as it goes to the root  of  the  matter  having  an\n           effect to repel conclusively the  eyewitnesses’  version  to  be\n           true.”</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">40.   Similarly, a fact stated by a doctor in a post mortem report could  be\nrejected by a Court relying on eye witness testimony, though this  would  be\nquite infrequent. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"118703205\" id=\"span_5\">In <a href=\"/doc/118703205/\" id=\"a_14\">Dayal Singh v. State of Uttaranchal</a>[7] the post  mortem\nreport and the oral testimony of the doctor who conducted  that  examination\nwas that no internal or external injuries were found  on  the  body  of  the\ndeceased. This Court rejected the “medical evidence” and upheld the view  of\nthe Trial Court  (and  the  High  Court)  that  the  testimony  of  the  eye\nwitnesses supported by other evidence would prevail  over  the  post  mortem\nreport and testimony of the doctor. It was held,\n\n           [T]he trial court has rightly ignored the deliberate  lapses  of\n           the investigating officer as  well  as  the  post-mortem  report\n           prepared by Dr C.N. Tewari.  The  consistent  statement  of  the\n           eyewitnesses which were  fully  supported  and  corroborated  by\n           other witnesses, and the investigation of the  crime,  including\n           recovery of lathis, inquest report, recovery of the pagri of one\n           of the accused from the place of occurrence,  immediate  lodging\n           of FIR and the deceased succumbing to his injuries within a very\n           short  time,  establish  the  case  of  the  prosecution  beyond\n           reasonable doubt. These lapses on the part of PW 3 [doctor]  and\n           PW 6 [investigating officer] are a deliberate attempt  on  their\n           part to prepare reports and documents in a designedly  defective\n           manner which would have prejudiced the case of  the  prosecution\n           and resulted in the  acquittal  of  the  accused,  but  for  the\n           correct approach of the trial court to  do  justice  and  ensure\n           that the guilty did  not  go  scot-free.  The  evidence  of  the\n           eyewitness  which  was  reliable  and  worthy  of  credence  has\n           justifiably been relied upon by the court.”</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">41.   An opinion given by a doctor,  based  on  the  facts  recorded  on  an\nexamination of a victim of a crime, could be rejected by relying  on  cogent\nand trustworthy eye witness testimony. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1066964\" id=\"span_6\">In <a href=\"/doc/1066964/\" id=\"a_15\">Mange v. State  of  Haryana</a>[8]  an\neye witness to a rape stated that the offence was committed on a  particular\nday and at a particular time. However, the   lady    doctor  who    examined\nthe   victim  was of the\n\nopinion that the offence was committed two days earlier. This Court did  not\naccept the opinion  and  preferred  to  rely  on  the  eye  witness  account\nholding, inter alia, that\n\n           “It is difficult for  any  medical  expert  to  give  the  exact\n           duration of time when the rape was committed. More  particularly\n           when we have the evidence of PW 4 [eye witness] as to  the  time\n           and date of the occurrence, the medical evidence can  hardly  be\n           relied upon to falsify the evidence of  the  eyewitness  because\n           the medical evidence is guided by various factors based on guess\n           and certain calculations.”</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">42.   This being the position, insofar as the injury to deceased Ram  Narain\nis concerned, Dr. D.K. Purohit (PW-18) stated  that  he  had  conducted  the\npost mortem examination on the dead body.  He described the injuries on  the\nbody and in his cross-examination categorically stated as a matter  of  fact\nthat “This is correct to suggest that there was no  firearm  injury  on  the\nbody of Ram Narain”. In the face of this categorical factual assertion,  and\nabsent any cogent evidence to the contrary, we cannot accept the  conclusion\narrived at by the Trial Court and the High Court that  deceased  Ram  Narain\nsuffered a gunshot  injury.  The  ocular  evidence  undoubtedly  shows  that\ndeceased Ram Narain was fired at by appellant Mohan Lal, but in view of  the\nunchallenged testimony of the doctor it is quite clear that the gunshot  did\nnot hit deceased Ram Narain and the cause  of  his  death  was  due  to  the\ncumulative effect of the various injuries suffered by him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">43.   However, this has no impact on our final conclusion since  we  are  in\nthe agreement with the Trial Court and the High Court  that  the  appellants\nhad the common intention of causing  the  death  of  deceased  Rameshwarlal,\ndeceased Ram Narain, deceased Mohanlal and  injured  Rajaram.  That  Rajaram\nsurvived the injuries is fortuitous.  We are also  in  agreement  with  both\nthe Courts that the appellants were armed with pistols  and  that  they  had\nfired at their victims with the intention of killing them. We have not  been\nshown anything that would suggest the contrary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">Conclusion:\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">44.   We uphold the concurrent findings of the  Trial  Court  and  the  High\nCourt and confirm the conviction and sentence on the  appellants.
