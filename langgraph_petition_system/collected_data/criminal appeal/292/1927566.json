By\nthe same  common judgment  the High  Court also\t disposed of\ncompanion criminal  appeals by\tother accused as well as the\nappeal against\tacquittal of  concerned accused\t as filed by\nthe State.  The\t Criminal  Appeal  of  Ram  Sanjiwan  Singh,\naccused no.10  was dismissed  by the  High Court  while\t the\nnotice for enhancement was made absolute and the sentence of\nRam Sanjiwan  Singh under  <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 304-A</a>,  IPC was  enhanced\nupto life  imprisonment.

After recording  the\t prosecution\nevidence and  after hearing the accused the learned Sessions\nJudge came to the conclusion that the prosecution had failed\nto establish  its case\tof criminal  conspiracy against\t the\nconcerned accused.  Consequently accused  no.11 Pyara Singh,\naccused no.12  Siroman Singh  and accused  no.13  Dhurandhar\nSingh were  acquitted of  the offences\twith which they were\ncharged.

So far as\nthe remaining  8 accused were concerned the learned Sessions\nJudge held  relying on the eye-witness account deposed to by\nthe  witnesses\t and  other  evidence  on  record  that\t the\nprosecution had\t brought home  charge under Section 302 read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_35\">Section  34</a> IPC  against accused  no.1 Moti Lal Tiwary,\naccused no.2  Panchu Ram,  accused no.3 Laxmi Sonal, accused\nno.4 Malkit  Singh, accused no.5 Arurendra Bahadur Singh and\naccused no.6  Ganesh Gwala.

All these sentences were ordered to run concurrently.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">     As stated\tabove accused no.10 Ram Sanjiwan Singh filed\nCriminal Appeal\t No.15 of  1976 before\tthe  High  Court  of\nJudicature at  Patna.  Accused\tnos.1,\t4  and\t6  preferred\nCriminal Appeal\t No.28 of 1976. The State of Bihar preferred\nGovernment Appeal  No.1 of  1976  seeking  conviction  under\nSection 302  so far  as accused no.10 Ram Sanjiwan Singh was\nconcerned and  also for\t conviction of other six accused who\nwere acquitted\tby the\tTrial Court  while  informant  Sunil\nSingh preferred\t Criminal Revision  Application 137  of 1976\nagainst six  accused out of whom accused nos.1, 4 and 6 were\nthree of  them. As  noted earlier the High Court also issued\nnotice of  enhancement of  sentence in\tthe Criminal  Appeal\nNo.15 of 1976 filed by accused no.10 Ram Sanjiwan Singh. All\nthese  appeals,\t  revision  and\t enhancement  notice  issued\nagainst accused\t Ram Sanjiwan  Singh were  heard together by\nthe Division Bench of the High Court and were disposed of by\na common judgment giving rise to the present proceedings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">      Before  we deal with the main contentions canvassed by\nthe learned  senior counsel  Shri  Rajender  Singh  for\t the\nappellants it  will be necessary to keep in view the limited\nscope of the present proceedings which arise out of grant of\nspecial leave  to appeal  against orders  of conviction\t and\nsentence as  rendered by  both the  courts below against the\npresent appellants.  The concurrent findings reached by both\nthe courts below on evidence cannot be lightly brushed aside\nand unless  it is  shown that  the findings  are against the\nweight of  evidence or are vitiated by any legal error, this\nCourt does  not interfere  with them  as a matter of course,\nespecially when\t they are  based on appreciation of evidence\nof eyewitnesses\t found to  be acceptable  by both the courts\nbelow. It is in that light that we have to consider the main\ncontentions  canvassed\t by  learned   senior  counsel\tShri\nRajender Singh in support of these appeals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">     While referring to the main features of the prosecution\ncase in\t earlier part of this judgment we have indicated how\nthe assault  on deceased  Ramchandra Singh  is said  to have\nbeen mounted  by the  accused and  how the said incident was\nallegedly witnessed  by the  eye-witnesses. To recapitulate,\nthe prosecution\t case hinges  on the  eye-witness account of\nP.W.1 Rameshwar\t Prasad, P.W.3\tGazraj Singh,  P.W.4 Shankar\nSingh and  P.W.5 Sunil\tSingh. P.Ws.1  and 3  were the\tbody\nguards of the deceased while P.W.4 was his nephew and P.W.5,\nthe first  informant, was  his grandson.  We have been taken\nthrough the  evidence of  these witnesses. We may state that\nevidence of  these eye-witnesses has been relied upon by the\nTrial Court  as well  as by  the High Court by giving cogent\nreasons. Having\t given our anxious consideration to the said\nevidence once  again we\t find that  their evidence  has well\nstood the test of cross examination and was rightly accepted\nby both the aforesaid courts. These witnesses have supported\nthe  prosecution  case\tin  all\t material  particulars.\t The\npicture which  has  been  projected  from  this\t eye-witness\naccount is to the effect that on 24th May 1972 at about 6.15\np.m. in\t front of  the co-operative  store in  Sakchi Bazar,\nJamshedpur while  the deceased\twho was\t looking after\tthat\nstore was  sitting on  the western  side of the verandah and\nwas having  a shave  from a  barber, he became the target of\npistol shots  and number  of bullets were pumped in his body\nand in\tthis assault  all the present appellants are clearly\nindicted by  the eye-witness  account. It is also shown that\nthe eye-witnesses  who were  standing on the eastern side of\nthe verandah  rushed on\t spot on witnessing this assault the\naccused who  had come in company with other accused who were\nultimately acquitted  and for  whose involvement  we may not\nsay anything  further. Then  the  deceased  in\ta  profusely\nbleeding condition  was taken  to the Tata Memorial Hospital\nby P.W.4  Shankar Singh and informant Sunil Singh P.W.5. The\nPolice Sub-Inspector  incharge of  Sakchi Police Station who\nhad already  received information  regarding the  firing  in\nSakchi Bazar  had in  the meantime  rushed to  the  hospital\nwhere the  deceased was\t removed and  in the hospital at the\nearliest opportunity  by about 7.00 p.m. he recorded the FIR\ngiven by  the informant P.W.5 Sunil Singh. It has to be kept\nin view\t that the  incident had taken place by about 6.15 in\nthe evening  and thereafter  the deceased profusely bleeding\nhad to be taken in a taxi after getting a taxi from the taxi\nstand and on reaching the hospital the deceased was examined\nby Dr.\tSaroj Kumar  Das P.W.33\t at 6.42  p.m.\tand  he\t was\ndeclared &#x27;Brought  dead&#x27;. The  doctor had  found nine bullet\ninjuries  on   the  person  of\tthe  deceased.\tUnder  these\ncircumstances the  evidence of\tP.W.44 Prayag Narain who was\nOffice-In-charge  of   Sakchi  Police\tStation\t has  to  be\nappreciated.  He   had\tbroadly\t supported  the\t prosecution\nversion in  connection with  the prompt\t recording of FIR at\nthe hospital  . His  evidence fully  supports the version of\ncomplainant P.W.5  Sunil Singh.\t Prayag Narain P.W.44 stated\nthat from  April 1971 to June 1973 he was Officer In-charge,\nSakchi Police  Station and  on 24th  May 1972  at about 6.20\np.m. at\t the Police Station he got a telephonic message that\nthere had  been firing\tin the Sakchi Bazar which had led to\nchaos. He  made a  station diary  about it and then left the\npolice station at about 6.30 p.m. and reached near the TISCO\nCo-operative Store  which he  found  deserted  although\t the\nstore was open. He found lot of blood on the verandah and an\nupturned chair\tbesmeared with\tblood. He also found a small\n&#x27;katori&#x27; meant for shaving and a brush there. He left Ranjit\nSingh, Sub-Inspector  of Police\t to  guard  that  place\t and\nhimself proceeded at 6.55 p.m. to the Tata Memorial Hospital\nwhere he met Sunil Singh and got recorded the &#x27;fardbeyan&#x27; of\nSunil  Singh  by  Lala\tPrasad\tSrivastava.  It\t has  to  be\nappreciated that  when Dr.  Das\t P.W.33\t declared  that\t the\ndeceased was  brought dead  in the  hospital  it  was  quite\nnatural on  the part of the police witness P.W.44 to enquire\nfrom the  complainant  Sunil  Singh  P.W.5  as\tto  how\t the\nincident bed  happened and  as Sunil  Singh had by that time\ncame to\t know that his grandfather was already dead he would\nnaturally give\this version  about how the incident occurred\nwithout being  required to further atrend upon the deceased.\nUnder these  circumstances recording  of  the &#x27;fardbeyan&#x27; at\n7.00 p.m. is rightly held by both the courts below a  prompt\nrecording   of the   First Information\tReport regarding the\nincident. In  this connection  we may  also note  one strong\nexception taken\t  by  learned\tsenior counsel Shri Rajender\nSingh about  the recording of FIR. He submitted that in fact\nFIR was\t recorded two  days&#x27; late, that is, on 26th May 1972\nbecause by  that time a copy of the said FIR is said to have\nreached the  Court of  Judicial Magistrate,  1st Class\tand,\ntherefore,  the alleged\t recording of  the FIR\tat 7.00 p.m.\nin   the hospital   is a concocted version and an attempt is\nmade   by the\tprosecution  to\t ante-time and ante-date the\nFIR. It\t is not\t possible to  agree with this contention for\nthe simple  reason that nothing substantial could be brought\nout in\tthe cross examination either of Sunil Singh P.W.5 or\nthe  witness   Prayag  Narain\tP.W.44\tto  support  such  a\ncontention.  That  apart,  there  are  available  on  record\npositive checks\t by way of contemporaneous record indicating\nthat the  FIR must  have been  recorded by  7.00 p.m. in the\nhospital. It  is the  evidence or  Prayag Narain P.W.44 that\nafter the  &#x27;fardbeyan&#x27;was taken down at the hospital at 7.00\np.m. a\tformal FIR  was registered immediately thereafter in\nthe Police  station and it is in evidence that the said case\nwas registered\tas Crime  Case\tNo.15/72.  The\tevidence  of\nwitness Prayag\tNarain P.W.44  further shows  that after  he\nreached the  hospital and  after he recorded the &#x27;fardbeyan&#x27;\nhe went to the morgue and he got performed the inquest Exh.4\nover the  dead body  in presence of P.W.9 Bharat Singh Mohan\nSingh P.W.10  and Saatan  Mukhi P.W.23.\t He found  that\t the\nbeard of  the dead  body was  partly shaved.  So far  as the\ninquest report\tis concerned  it is at Page 518 of the Paper\nBook. It  is in form No.38 and in the reference column Sakhi\nPolice Station Case No.15 of 24.5.72 under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_45\">Sections 148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_46\">149</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_47\">302</a>\t IPC and  <a href=\"/doc/8793292/\" id=\"a_48\">Sections 25(a)</a>  and <a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_49\">27</a>  of the Arms Act is\nclearly mentioned.  This shows\tthat by the time the inquest\nreport was  prepared in\t the morgue  of the  hospital itself\nCriminal Case No.15 was already got registered in the police\nstation on  the basis  of &#x27;fardbeyan&#x27;  of P.W.5 Sunil Singh.\nThis is\t one positive  check of contemporaneous nature which\nshows that  &#x27;fardbeyan&#x27; had  seen the light of the day prior\nto the\tpreparation of\tthe inquest  report  itself  in\t the\nmorgue of the hospital on that night.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">     The second\t positive check\t for lending credence to the\n&#x27;fardbeyan&#x27; recorded  at the hospital is supplied by another\nevidence of  contemporaneous nature being seizure memo which\nis found  at page 538 Of the Paper book. Evidence of witness\nprayag Narain  P.W.44 shows  that from\tthe hospital  he had\ngone to the site and had got the articles lying on the scene\nof offence  seized. That  seizure list\tExh.3  also  clearly\nrefers to  Sakchi Police Station Case No.15 dated 24.5.72 on\nthe same  lines on  which the  inquest report  refers to the\npolice case  and the  nature of\t the offences  for which the\ncase was  registered. The  time and date of seizure is shown\nto be 24th May 1972 at 12.30 o&#x27;clock at night. Nothing could\nbe alleged  against the\t preparation of\t the seizure list at\nthat time.  This also indicates that investigation which was\ntriggered off  pursuant to  the recording  of  the  FIR\t had\nresulted in  all these subsequent steps during the course of\ninvestigation on the night of 24th May itself and were taken\nout pursuant  to the recording of the FIR, first &#x27;fardbeyan&#x27;\nat the\thospital and  then the\tformal FIR  at Sakchi Police\nStation. Consequently  it could not be said that the FIR was\nante-timed or that it was not recorded as it was tried to be\nsuggested by  the prosecution.\tIf it was registered only on\n26th May,  1972 as  suggested by  the learned senior counsel\nfor the\t appellants  all  the  steps  taken  by\t the  police\npursuant to  the recording   of the  FIR in  the evening and\nnight of  24th May,  1972 and which have clearly referred to\nthe recording of the FIR  and registering  of  the  Criminal\nCase   No.15   of 24.5.72  at\tthe police   station on\t the\nevening\t of that day itself would  not\thave  transpired  at\nall.   It   was\t  then submitted that  this FIR\t had reached\nthe Magistrate&#x27;s  Court only on\t 26th May  1972. It  is easy\nto visualize  that after  all necessary immediate steps were\ntaken after  the recording  of the   FIR on  the evening  of\n24th May  1972 if  the FIR  was sent on\t the next day to the\nMagistrate&#x27;s Court  it could  not be said that it was in any\nway  delayed.  The  fact  that\tit  was\t placed\t before\t the\nMagistrate on  26th May\t would only indicate that the  clerk\nconcerned  must\t have  brought\tit  to\tthe  notice  of\t the\nMagistrate on\t26th  May   1972   but\t that\twould\t not\nnecessarily mean  that copy  of the  FIR had not reached the\nMagistrate&#x27;s office on the next day. Consequently it must be\nheld  that   the  First\t  Information  Report  was  promptly\nregistered at  the Police  station hot\ton the\theels of the\nhappening of  the incident  on the  evening of\t24th May  at\nSakchi Bazar and that FIR reflected almost a contemporaneous\naccount of  what had  taken place  on spot. That recitals in\nthis FIR  clearly indicate  that an  assault was  mounted on\ndeceased Ramchandra  Singh by accused including\t the present\nappellants nos.2 and 5 in Criminal Appeal No.348 of 1985. It\nhad also  indicate the involvement of appellants in Criminal\nAppeal No.387  of 1985\toriginal accused  no.10 Ram Sanjiwan\nSingh who  is said to have fired pistol shot in air to scare\naway the  public. It  is  true\tthat  FIR  did\tnot  mention\npresence of accused no.6 Ganesh Gwala. But this circumstance\nwhich was  heavily relied upon by the learned senior counsel\nfor the\t appellants cannot  advance the\t case of the accused\nany further  for the  simple  reason  that  the\t FIR  itself\nmentioned that\tthere were two other persons whose names the\nfirst informant\t Sunil Singh  did not  know. This version of\nhis in\tthe &#x27;fardbeyan&#x27;\t was fully  supported by  him at the\nstage of  trial and nothing substantial could be brought out\nin his cross examination to shake this version. Consequently\nit must\t be held  that the  FIR fully  corroborated the eye-\nwitness account\t deposed to  by first  informant Sunil Singh\nP.W.5 and other eye-witnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">     In this  connection it  was submitted by learned senior\ncounsel Shri  Rajender\tSingh that the evidence showed there\nwere  other   independent   witnesses\tavailable   in\t the\nsurrounding area where the incident as alleged to have taken\nplace in  broad day  light  in\tthe  evening  in  a  thickly\npopulated bazar.  That still  prosecution had not thought it\nfit to\texamine any  outside witness though  the evidence of\nP.W.44 shows  that he  had  recorded  statements  of  nearby\nshopkeepers. It\t may be so, However that by itself would not\ndetract from the veracity of the eye-witness account. It has\nto be  kept in\tview that  P.W.1 Rameshwar  Prasad and P.W.3\nGazraj Singh  were the\tbody guards  of the  deceased. Their\npresence on  the spot  was,  therefore,\t quite\tnatural\t and\nprobable. It  is unfortunate  that though  being body guards\nthey could not save the deceased. In this connection learned\nsenior\tcounsel\t Shri  Rajender\t Singh\tsubmitted  that\t the\nconduct of  these body\tguards is  very unnatural as much as\nthey did  not rush  to save their master. It is difficult to\nappreciate this\t contention, It\t has to he kept in view that\nthe eye-witness\t account shows\tthat the assault was mounted\nall of\ta sudden by a group of persons including the present\nappellants who\tcame suddenly  on spot and shot the deceased\nsimultaneously and  pumped bullets  in him  and\t immediately\nthereafter ran away. Because of this sudden attack by pistol\nshots the  witnesses which were standing on the eastern side\nof the\tverandah would remain helpless spectators and moment\nthey rushed  on the  spot they\tfound their  master  heavily\nwounded and  bleeding, It  is not the case of the defence or\neven the  prosecution that these body guards were armed with\nany   firearms so that they could retaliate on the contrary,\nas  the\t  evidence  shows  there  was  hardly  any  time  to\nretaliate. It  was a  sudden attack  mounted on the deceased\nwho was sitting in the chair and had undergone half shave of\nhis beard.  Under these circumstances it cannot be said that\nP.W.1 Rameshwar Prasad and P.W.3 Gazraj Singh being the body\nguards of  the deceased\t had exhibited any unnatural conduct\nin not\ttrying to  save the  deceased from  the onslaught of\nbullet shots  mounted  on  him\tby  the\t accused  and  their\ncompanions on spot.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">     It was  next contended that witness Shankar Singh P.W.4\nwas the\t nephew\t and  witness  Sunil  Singh  P.W.5  was\t the\ngrandson  of   the  deceased   and,  therefore,\t  they\twere\ninterested in  the deceased  and that  there was  deepseated\nenmity\tbetween\t  accused  Pyara   Singh  who  was  a  rival\ncontractor with\t the deceased  and who\tis alleged  to\thave\nentered into a criminal conspiracy with the accused who were\nallegedly hired\t assassins to liquidate the deceased. Now it\nis true\t that both  the courts\tbelow have  not accepted the\ncase of\t criminal conspiracy but still the fact remains that\na group\t of assassins  mounted a  well determined  and\tpre-\nplanned attack\ton the\tdeceased when he was getting himself\nshaved by  sitting in  the verandah near Shop No.4 in Sakchi\nBazar. Presence of P.W.5 Sunil singh and P.W.4 Shankar Singh\nwas also  quite natural as the evidence shows that they were\nhelping the  deceased in  looking after\t the shop.  In\tfact\nnothing was  alleged in\t the cross  examination of these two\nwitnesses to  indicate\tthat  their  presence  on  spot\t was\nunexpected or  could not  have been  there. The\t evidence of\nP.W.4 Shankar  Singh and  P.W.5 Sunil  Singh has  also fully\ncorroborated the  eye-witness  account\tof  P.W.1  Rameshwar\nPrasad and P.W.3 Gazraj Singh and their evidence in turn has\nstood corroborated by the recitals in the FIR which has been\nfound  to   reflect  3\tprompt\tand  almost  contemporaneous\nrecording of  what had\thappened on  spot on  that  faithful\nevening. We,  therefore, find that on the aforesaid evidence\nof eye-witnesses  the prosecution had proved to the hilt its\ncase against  the appellant  no.2 Moti\tLal  Tiwary  accused\nno.1, appellant no.5 Malkit Singh accused no.4 and appellant\nno.7 Ganesh  Gwala accused  no.6. So  far as  appellant no.1\naccused no.10  Ram Senjiwan  Singh is  concerned on the eye-\nwitness account\t which is  found acceptable and reliable the\nprosecution had\t also established  its case  that  the\tsaid\naccused had  shared the common intention to do away with the\ndeceased as he had shot in the air so that the people in the\nvicinity would\tbe scared  and may not come to the rescue of\nthe deceased  and  he  also  could  have  been\tlegitimately\nconvicted under\t Section 302  read <a href=\"/doc/968081/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 34</a> along with his\ncompanions. However  the learned  Trial Judge thought it fit\nto convict  him under  Section 304 Part I, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_51\">IPC</a> and the State\nappeal against acquittal of appellant no.1 accused no.10 Ram\nSanjiwan Singh\tcame to\t be dismissed  by the High Court and\nagainst that part of the decision of the High Court there is\nno appeal  before this\tCourt by  special  leave.  Therefore\naccused Ram  Sanjiwan Singh&#x27;s  acquittal under\tSection\t 302\nread with  <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 34</a>  IPC has\tcome to\t stay and  cannot be\ninterfered with.  We shall  deal  with\tthe  nature  of\t the\nsentence imposed  on  him  by  the  High  Court\t by  way  of\nenhancement from  seven years  to life imprisonment a little\nlater. We  may,\t however,  deal\t with  the  main  contention\ncanvassed by  learned senior counsel Shri Rajender Singh for\nsubmitting that the prosecution had not established its case\nbeyond reasonable  doubt so  far as conviction under Section\n302 read  with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_53\">Section\t34</a>  IPC\t is  concerned.\t He  firstly\ncontended that\tit was\tmost unnatural\tthat the accused who\nwere not  shown to have been known to anyone could have been\nimplicated in  the incident  by the eye-witnesses in the way\nthey have  done. lt  is not  possible  to  agree  with\tthis\ncontention. It is the case of the prosecution witnesses that\nthese accused  belonged to the group of Pyara Singh and even\nthough the case of criminal conspiracy is not established it\ncould not  be said  that they  were totally  unknown to\t the\nprosecution witnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">     It was  next contended that it would be quite unnatural\nfor these accused to mount an attack in broad day light in a\nthickly populated  bazar area  when the\t deceased was having\nhis shave.  We fail  to appreciate  how this circumstance by\nitself would  make an assault by the accused unnatural. Once\nan attack  was decided\tupon and  pre-planned the victim was\ntraced out  and identified, if the accused in the company of\ntheir other  companions came armed with pistols and suddenly\nmounted an  attack on helpless victim who was sitting on the\nchair and  was getting\thimself shaved\tit could not be said\nthat it\t was an\t attack which  could not  have taken  place,\nespecially when the eye-witness account is that it had taken\nplace and  the fact  remains that the deceased on account of\nthis attack  died on  spot. It\thas also  to be kept in view\nthat the  original accused  no.5 Arurendra  Bahadur Singh  @\nLallu Singh  and accused no.8 Ganesh Choubey were also being\nprosecuted and were convicted by the Trial Court on the very\nsame eye-witness account. That appeals of both these injured\naccused have  abated because  they are\tdead. It  could not,\ntherefore, be  said that this entire story of the attack was\na fabric  of imagination as tried to be suggested by learned\nsenior counsel Shri Rajender Singh.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">     It was  next contended  that the  injuries found on the\ndead body  did not  corroborate the  version  of  inflicting\nbullet injuries\t as deposed  to by  the eye-witnesses.\tThis\ncontention is  to be  stated only  to be rejected. Dr. Bhola\nRam  Mahto,   Civil  Assistant\tSurgeon\t at  the  Government\nHospital,  Jamshedpur\twho  conducted\t the   post   mortem\nexamination on\tthe dead body found eight penetrating wounds\non it  and according  to the  doctor all  injuries were ante\nmortem and were caused by high velocity missile like bullet.\nWhen multiple bullet injuries were found on the dead body it\nis easy\t to visualize  that  it\t would\tnot  have  been\t the\nhandiwork of  only one\tperson armed  with one\tpistol. That\nclearly indicated plurality of persons who had assaulted the\ndeceased with  firearms. Consequently  it could\t not be said\nthat the injuries found on the dead body did not support the\nprosecution version deposed to by the eyewitnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">     It was  next contended  that P.W.4\t Shankar  Singh\t had\nstated that he had taken the deceased to the hospital and he\nhad not\t mentioned the\tname of Sunil. We fail to appreciate\nhow this  would make any difference as Sunil Singh P.W.5 who\nwas present  on\t the  spot  and\t who  deposed  that  he\t had\naccompanied the\t deceased to the hospital had stood the test\nof cross examination. His version is also fully corroborated\nby the\tevidence of P.W.44 Prayag Narain who met Sunil Singh\nin the hospital and who recorded his &#x27;fardbeyan&#x27;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">     It was next contended by learned senior counsel for the\nappellants that\t the barber  who shaved the deceased was not\nexamined. Even\tthis contention\t cannot advance\t the case of\nthe appellants\tfor the simple reason that P.W.5 Sunil Singh\nstated in his evidence as elicited in cross examination that\nhe was\ttrying to trace the barber. The evidence also showed\nthat because  of the  firing the barber had run away. It was\ntried to  be suggested\tthat this  very barber used to shave\nthe deceased  twice a  week. That  may be so. But it was not\nclear as  to who  was the  barber who shaved the deceased on\nthat fateful  evening nor  was anything\t pointed out  in the\ncross examination of Sunil Singh P.W.5 that he knew the name\nof the\tbarber. But  even otherwise  non-examination of\t the\nbarber did  not affect\tthe core  of  the  prosecution\tcase\nagainst the  accused which  has stood  well  established  on\nrecord by the eye-witness account of aforesaid eye-witnesses\nP.Ws.1, 3, 4 and 5.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">     It was  next contended that the case diary was tempered\nwith. Even this submission cannot be accepted for the simple\nreason that  the evidence  of Prayag Narain P.W.44 and other\npolice witnesses  clearly showed that four copies were taken\nout in\tconnection with the entries in the police diary. The\nevidence of  P W.44  Prayag Narain  had shown  that the case\ndiary was  written in  the  prescribed\tform.  There  was  a\nconnective number of the case diary. In that case the serial\nnumber of the case diary was not connective because that had\nbeen written  in four  copies instead of three. This part of\nthe evidence  has  stood  well\testablished  on\t record\t and\nconsequently even  this contention  cannot be  of any use to\nthe appellants\tto show that the recording of the FIR was in\nany way ante-timed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">     It was  next contended that these alleged eye-witnesses\nhad bad\t antecedents. That  might be  so, however  if  their\npresence on the spot was natural and they could witness what\nhappened on  spot it  could  not  be  said  that  they\twere\nnecessarily deposing  falsely about what they saw on spot. A\nfaint attempt  was tried  to be made that if the assault was\nmounted from a distance of one foot, as one of the witnesses\nstated, the  injuries found on the dead body would have been\nmore pronounced.  This submission  loses its importance for.\nthe simple  reason  that  witness  Gazraj  Singh  P.W.3\t had\ndeposed that  accused Moti  Lal\t Tiwary\t had  fired  from  a\ndistance of 1 or 1/2 or 2 metres and Malkit had fired from 1\nmetre and other people were firing from a distance of 2 or 3\nmetres. This part of the evidence has well stood the test of\ncross examination  and could clearly support the prosecution\nversion regarding the finding of the firearm injuries on the\ndeceased. In  this connection it has also to be kept in view\nthat P.W.5  Sunil Singh\t had stated  that  even\t earlier  an\nattempt\t was  made  to\tmurder\tthe  deceased.\tUnder  these\ncircumstances if the deceased had kept himself in company of\nhis body  guards as  well as  his near\trelatives like Sunil\nSingh P.W.5,  his grandson  and\t Shankar  Singh\t P.W.4,\t his\nnephew it  could not  be said  that this  was  an  unnatural\nconduct.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">     It was  then submitted  that in  the inquest report the\nnames of  the assailants  were not shown. It is obvious that\nthere was no column in inquest report about the names of the\nassailants and\tthere was  no occasion for anyone to mention\nthe names  of the  assailants in  the inquest report. It was\nthen submitted\tthat Dr.  Saroj Kumar  Das P.W.33 had stated\nthat witness  Shankar Singh had brought the dead body and he\nhad not\t stated the  name of  Sunil. This  appeared to be an\nomission as  Sunil&#x27;s presence  was  clearly  deposed  to  by\nP.W.44 who  got recorded  his &#x27;fardbeyan&#x27;  and once  Sunil&#x27;s\nevidence that he accompanied the deceased to the hospital is\nfound believable  and has  well\t stood\tthe  test  of  cross\nexamination the\t non-mentioning of  the name of Sunil by Dr.\nS.K. Das  would not  make any difference and would pale into\ninsignificance. For  all  these\t reasons,  therefore,  these\nappeals are  liable to\tbe dismissed.  These were  the\tonly\ncontentions and\t as there  is no  substance  in\t them,\tthis\nresult is  inevitable. Consequently  so far as the appellant\nno.1 accused  no.10 Moti  Lal Tiwary, appellant no.5 accused\nno.4 Malkit  Singh and\tappellant no.7\taccused no.6  Ganesh\nGwala are concerned, their Criminal Appeal NO.388 of 1985 is\nliable to be dismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">     However, so  far as  Criminal Appeal  No.387 of 1985 by\naccused Ram  Sanjiwan Singh  is concerned  as we  have noted\nearlier his  acquittal under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 302</a> IPC read <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 34</a>\nIPC has\t stood confirmed.  The learned\tSessions  Judge\t has\nimposed on  him for that offence sentence to suffer rigorous\nimprisonment  for  seven  years.  In  his  appeal,  however,\npursuant to  the  notice  of  enhancement,  the\t High  Court\nthought it fit to enhance his sentence to life imprisonment.\nTo that\t extent the  decision of  the High Court seems to be\ninconsistent. When  the High  Court held  that\taccused\t Ram\nSanjiwan Singh\thad not\t committed offence  of\tmurder\tand,\ntherefore. as  a logical  corollary he\twas not liable to be\nsentenced  to\tlife  imprisonment,   it  is   difficult  to\nappreciate how\tthe same sentence of life imprisonment could\nbe imposed  on him  by enhancing  his sentence under Section\n304 Part I. It is now well settled that imposing of sentence\nis in  the realm  of discretion of the court and unless this\nsentence is  found to  be grossly  inadequate the  appellate\ncourt  would  not  be  justified  in  interfering  with\t the\ndiscretionary order of sentence. On the facts of the present\ncase, it  may not  be said  that the sentence of seven years\nrigorous imprisonment  as imposed  by the  Trial  Court\t was\ngrossly inadequate.
