The appellant/complainant filed complaint\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/444619/\" id=\"a_5\">section 200</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure before\n\nthe J.M.F.C Court alleging that, the accused has\n\ncommitted an offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_6\">section 138</a> of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                               3</span>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_7\">Negotiable Instrument Act</a> 1881 (Hereinafter referred for\n\nshort as &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_8\">N.I Act</a>&quot;.)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">        4.     It is the case of the complainant that, the\n\ncomplainant is co-operative Bank involved in Banking\n\nbusiness. The accused is a member of complainant-\n\nBank and availed loan from the Bank, but failed to\n\nrepay        the   same.   When   the   complainant-Bank\n\napproached accused and insisted for payment of dues,\n\nhe issued cheque bearing No.022627 dated: 24-05-2007\n\nfor Rs.3,28,000/- drawn in favour of the Bank.        The\n\nsaid cheque was presented through its banker D.C.C\n\nBank Bidar, but it was returned dishonoured with\n\nendorsement that funds &quot;insufficient&quot;. An intimation in\n\nthis regard was received on 10-07-2007. Then the\n\ncomplainant-Bank issued demand notice on 30-07-\n\n2007. The accused did not reply the aforesaid notice,\n\nnor repaid the amount. Hence the complaint was\n\nlodged.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                               4</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">       5.   The accused appeared before the trial court.\n\nThe trial court put the substance of accusation to\n\naccused and recorded the plea of accused. The accused\n\npleaded not guilty and claimed to be tried.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">     6.     The complainant-Bank got examined its\n\nManager Mr. Kalyan Rao Malge as PW.1 and also got\n\nexamined another witness as PW.2 and got marked five\n\ndocuments as per Ex.P.1 to Ex.P.05 and closed its side\n\nevidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">     7.

The accused has admitted that\n\nhis father had taken loan of Rs.1,50,000/- and accused\n\nissued cheque along with interest for Rs.3,20,000/-.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     c) the issuance of cheque and signature are not\n\ndisputed.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                6</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     d) Once the accused admitted the liability of his\n\nfather to repay the loan amount with interest then he is\n\nliable to pay the amount.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     e)   the death of father of the accused has no\n\nconsequence in view of <a href=\"/doc/1266802/\" id=\"a_11\">section 25(3)</a> of Indian Contract\n\nAct, the issuance of cheque by the accused saved\n\nLimitation    for   the   recovery        proceedings     by    the\n\ncomplainant-Bank.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     f) the trial court has wrongly came to the\n\nconclusion that though the legal notice issued to all the\n\nlegal heirs, but the case is filed only against this\n\naccused.

The\n\ningredients   of    <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_12\">section   138</a>    of    N.I   Act    are    quite\n\nindependent once having admitted issuance of cheque,\n\nthere is a presumption under <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_13\">section 139</a> of the N.I Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">The learned trial court Judge has committed grave error\n\nin acquitting the accused without considering the said\n\naspect.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                             7</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">       With these main grounds the complainant has\n\nprayed to set aside the Judgment of acquittal and\n\nconvict the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">      10. Heard Sri.K.M.Ghate learned counsel for the\n\nappellant/complainant and Sri.Hanmanthraya Sindol\n\nlearned counsel for accused/respondent.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">     11.    The learned counsel for appellant argued\n\nthat, the issuance of cheque by the accused is admitted.\n\nThe cheque was presented and it was returned with\n\nendorsement funds &#x27;insufficient&#x27;. The cheque amount is\n\nfor Rs.3,28,000/-. The legal notice is served on accused.\n\nThe availment of loan by the father of the accused is\n\nadmitted. So for future liability the said cheque is\n\nissued. Accused has undertaken to discharge all the\n\nliability of his father. Now accused cannot contend that,\n\nhis liability is only to the extent of his 1/3rd share of\n\nRs.1,50,000/- i.e., only Rs.50,000/- as there were three\n\nlegal heirs. Such a contention is not permissible now.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                              8</span>\n\n\n\n\nThe accused is educated person, he himself has\n\nvoluntarily issued cheque. There is no force or undue\n\ninfluence on him for issuance of the cheque. Now\n\naccused is estopped from contending contrary to what\n\nhas been stated by him once cheque is issued knowing\n\nfully its consequence. The offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_14\">section 138</a> of\n\nN.I Act is committed if the cheque is returned with\n\nendorsement     as   funds       &quot;insufficient&quot;   or   &quot;exceed\n\narrangements&quot;. The accused cannot contend that, the\n\nother legal heirs are also liable, when once he has\n\nissued cheque. The cross-examination of PW.1 does not\n\ntake away the right of the Bank to recover the said\n\namount. The president of the Bank is also examined as\n\nPW.2 wherein his evidence indicates that, it is the\n\nlegally enforceable debt. Even otherwise as per <a href=\"/doc/1266802/\" id=\"a_15\">Section\n\n25(3)</a> of Indian Contract Act 1872 the accused is liable.\n\nThere is also pious obligation on accused to discharge\n\nhis father&#x27;s debt. It is not required under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_16\">section 138</a> of\n\nN.I Act that each and every particulars is to be stated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                               9</span>\n\n\n\n\nin the complaint. What is required is only liability i.e., is\n\nto be stated. When once liability is admitted, issuance of\n\ncheque, issuance of notice are admitted and payment of\n\nRs.50,000/- is admitted, then the trial court has\n\nwrongly acquitted the accused. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"6025602\" id=\"span_8\">In support of his\n\narguments the learned counsel relied upon the decision\n\nof Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court reported in 1) (2016) 3 SCC 1\n\nin case of <a href=\"/doc/6025602/\" id=\"a_17\">Don Ayengia Vs State of Assam and another</a>\n\nrelevant para No.11 and another decision reported in\n\n2013 SAR Crl.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"53206885\" id=\"span_9\">374= 2013 (2) Scale 368 (Head Note D) in\n\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/53206885/\" id=\"a_18\">Vijay Vs Laxman and another</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">      With these main arguments the learned counsel\n\nfor appellant prays to convict the accused by setting\n\naside the Judgment of acquittal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">      12.   As against this, the learned counsel for\n\naccused/respondent argued that, if the averment of the\n\ncomplaint, legal notice and the examination in chief of\n\nPW.1 are considered, it is evident that, all along it is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                             10</span>\n\n\n\n\nstated by the complainant-Bank that the loan is availed\n\nby the accused which is admittedly not true or proved.\n\nPW.1 himself has admitted that accused has not at all\n\navailed any loan. So the averments made in the\n\ncomplaint, statutory legal notice and examination in\n\nchief has no basis at all as they are contrary and\n\ninconsistent to the evidence placed before the Court.\n\nWhen the accused has not at all obtained any loan then\n\nthere is no liability on the accused to pay any amount.\n\nThe learned counsel further argued that, as per the\n\nBank, the loan was availed by the accused. As per the\n\nevidence produced before Trial Court the loan was\n\navailed by the father of the accused in the year 2001.\n\nThe total loan amount was Rs.1,50,000/-. The father of\n\naccused died in the year 2004. He had two sons, one\n\ndaughter and a wife.      There are four legal heirs to\n\ndeceased father of accused. Therefore, the arguments of\n\nthe complainant that the liability is only on this accused\n\nas pious obligation is not tenable so as to convict the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                             11</span>\n\n\n\n\naccused under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_19\">section 138</a> of N.I Act.         Further no\n\ndocuments or statement of Bank account in respect of\n\nsaid loan are produced to show that, what was the exact\n\namount borrowed and what was payable. Therefore, in\n\nthe absence of any such oral or documentary evidence\n\nin support of the complainant&#x27;s case, the trial court has\n\nrightly appreciated the evidence in a proper perspective\n\nand acquitted the accused. There is no error or illegality\n\nin the Judgment of the trial court. The learned counsel\n\nsupports the Judgment of the trial court and prays to\n\ndismiss the appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">     13.    I have perused the Judgment, records of the\n\ntrial court and appeal Memo and the decision relied on\n\nby the learned counsel for the appellant/complainant.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">     14.

My answer to the above point is in negative\n\nfor the following reasons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">     16.   The   complainant in his written complaint\n\nfiled before the Trial court has mentioned that, the\n\naccused being a member of the complainant-Bank\n\navailed loan, from the complainant-Bank. But he failed\n\nto repay the same. It is further mentioned that, when\n\nthe complainant-Bank approached the accused and\n\ninsisted for repayment of the loan he issued a cheque in\n\nquestion on 24-05-2007 for Rs.3,28,000/- drawn in\n\nfavour of the complainant-Bank, as the aforesaid\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                             13</span>\n\n\n\n\ncheque was dishonoured, complainant-Bank issued\n\ndemand notice to the accused. In the examination-in-\n\nchief affidavit filed by PW.1 Mr.Kalyanrao Manager of\n\ncomplainant-Bank it is stated that the accused has\n\navailed loan from complainant-Bank. But his cross-\n\nexamination reveals that, the contents of the written\n\ncomplaint and his evidence affidavit are not true. PW.1\n\nhas clearly admitted in his cross-examination that he\n\ncannot say the account number of the accused loan\n\naccount. PW.1 has also admitted that there is no loan\n\naccount of the accused in their Bank. This admission\n\nitself indicates that, the complainant-Bank has filed this\n\ncase taking false contention that accused has borrowed\n\nthe loan.   The said PW.1 further admitted that, the\n\naccused father had taken the loan. PW.1 has also\n\nadmitted that in the legal notice i.e. Ex.P.4, the\n\ncomplainant-Bank has mentioned that accused has\n\ntaken the loan. PW.1 has also admitted that in the\n\nnotice, complaint and his evidence it is mentioned that,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                             14</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe said cheque was issued by accused for discharge of\n\nthe loan borrowed by accused from Bank. When\n\nadmittedly there is no debt or loan borrowed or standing\n\nin the name of the accused with complainant-Bank,\n\nfiling this type of complaint and issuing notice stating\n\nthat,   accused   had   borrowed    the   loan   from   the\n\ncomplainant Bank and said cheque was issued for\n\ndischarge of said loan are all false contentions. PW.1\n\nhas further stated in his cross-examination that, in the\n\nyear 2001 the father of the accused had borrowed the\n\nloan and the father of the accused died in the year\n\n2004. The said aspects are not at all mentioned either\n\nin the complaint or in the evidence or in the statutory\n\nlegal notice. Therefore, such a complaint is not at all\n\nmaintainable to prove offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_21\">section 138</a> of N.I\n\nAct. The said statutory notice is also not a valid notice\n\nso as to attract the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_22\">section 138</a> of N.I Act.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                  15</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">        17 . PW.1 has stated in his cross-examination\n\nthat,    the   father   of   the       accused   had   borrowed\n\nRs.1,50,000/- No account extract in respect of said loan\n\nwas produced. PW.1 has also admitted that, he do not\n\nknow when the death of the father of the accused came\n\nto their knowledge. PW.1 has also admitted that, Ex.P.1\n\ncheque is related to accused father loan. PW.1 has also\n\nstated that, he do not know how many legal heirs to the\n\naccused father. He has also admitted that, Bank has\n\nnot produced any Bank statement or record to show\n\nthat the accused father was due a sum of Rs.3,28,000/-\n\nPW.1 has admitted that the documents executed by the\n\nfather of the accused were in the Bank. But they are not\n\nproduced       before   Court.        He   has   admitted   that,\n\ncomplainant has sent legal notices to accused, one\n\nRajesh and another Dr. Geeta. PW.1 has also stated\n\nthat said notice were issued more than three years after\n\nthe death of the father of the complainant. PW.1 has\n\nadmitted that, the accused after receipt of the notice\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                             16</span>\n\n\n\n\ncame to the Bank and met them. But complainant Bank\n\nhas not taken any document in writing from the\n\naccused stating that, accused is liable for the loan of his\n\nfather. PW.1 has no documents to show that, accused\n\nand others have come to the Bank and admitted the\n\nloan of their father and    their liability.    PW.1 do not\n\nknow when the father of the accused died. PW.1 has\n\nalso admitted that, the accused has not given cheque in\n\nhis hand and he do not know how that, cheque came\n\ninto the possession of complainant-Bank. PW.1 do not\n\nknow whether the writings in Ex.P.1 cheque are that of\n\nthe Bank officials or not. PW.1 has stated that, as on\n\n31-03-2004     the    principle    loan        amount   was\n\nRs.1,50,000/- and the interest was Rs.89,938/-.         So,\n\nwhy and how this cheque for Rs.3,28,000/- was issued\n\nas the amount due is not forthcoming. PW.1 has also\n\nadmitted that, the Bank has not taken any steps to\n\nrecover the loan during the lifetime of the father nor\n\nthey have produced any notice issued to him. PW.1 has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                            17</span>\n\n\n\n\nadmitted that, he knew very well that the accused father\n\nis no more and the loan is that of accused father but\n\nnot accused. Inspite of that, complainant has not\n\nmentioned these facts in the written complaint filed\n\nbefore Court. PW.1 changes his version before Court in\n\ncross-examination and deposed that, accused gave a\n\ncheque stating that he will pay the loan of his father.\n\nWhen the accused is admittedly not the member of the\n\nBank, nor he has borrowed the loan amount, the\n\nquestion of this accused paying the time barred debt or\n\nloan amount of his father does not arise. PW.1 has\n\nadmitted that, the earlier Manager had been to the\n\nhouse of the accused and asked them to give a cheque\n\nfor the present and thereafter they can discussed about\n\ntheir father loan.   PW.1 has expressed his ignorance\n\nthat a blank cheque was taken from accused by Bank\n\nofficials. A suggestion was made in cross-examination\n\nthat the accused father had three legal heirs. As\n\nRs.1,50,000/- was the loan this accused on his own\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                            18</span>\n\n\n\n\nvoluntarily, graciously has paid Rs.50,000/- as his\n\nshare on 26-11-2014.

On entire reading of the evidence of the\n\ncomplainant-PW.1 and the statutory legal notice/Ex.P.3\n\nit is evident that, this complaint was filed as if the\n\naccused has borrowed the loan and in discharge of the\n\nsaid loan accused issued the Ex.P.1-cheque. Loan\n\nborrowed by the father of the accused had admittedly\n\nbecome time barred long back. Without mentioning the\n\ntrue and correct facts and suppressing the true facts\n\nthis complaint was filed making a false allegation\n\nagainst the accused. Even the contents of the notice are\n\nfalse. Therefore no statutory presumption under <a href=\"/doc/1132672/\" id=\"a_23\">N.I Act</a>\n\ncan be raised in favour of the complainant-Bank when a\n\nfalse contention is taken and true facts are suppressed\n\nbefore the Court.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                            19</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">     19.   The complainant has examined one more\n\nwitness Mr. Mohammed Salim as PW.2. He has given\n\ntotally new version contrary to the written complainant\n\ncontents and evidence of PW.1 before the trial court. It\n\nappears that, the complainant-Bank came to know that\n\nthe averments in the complaint, evidence of PW.1 and\n\nnotice are not true when the PW.1 was cross-examined\n\nby the accused side. In order to make out some case\n\nand fill up lacuna in their case this PW.2 is examined.\n\nPW.2 has stated in his evidence that, the accused and\n\nhis family members voluntarily agreed to make the\n\npayment. He states that, the accused personally came\n\nto the Bank when the notice was issued in the year\n\n2007 and issued cheque in favour of the Bank. In his\n\ncross-examination PW.2 admitted that, the accused\n\nfather was a leader and he was financially sound\n\nperson. PW.2 clearly admitted that, he do not know\n\nwhich type of loan was given to the father of the\n\naccused.   PW.2   does   not    know   whether   in   the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                              20</span>\n\n\n\n\ncomplainant legal notice and in the evidence of the\n\ncomplainant /PW.1 whether it was stated that the\n\naccused had borrowed the loan. PW.2 also stated that,\n\nthe accused has not at all admitted that, he will pay the\n\nentire amount of his father. PW.2 does not know\n\nwhether the writings in Ex.P.1-cheque are that of\n\naccused   or   not.   PW.2    has   also   admitted   that,\n\ncomplainant-Bank has not taken any steps against the\n\nmother of the accused or other legal heirs. PW.2 further\n\nstated that, the accused has not borrowed the amount\n\nas shown in Ex.P.1. Therefore entire evidence of PW.1\n\nand PW.2 cuts the very root of the case and ingredients\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_24\">section 138</a> of Negotiable Instrument Act are not all\n\nmade   out.    The    complainant-Bank     has   failed   to\n\ndischarge initial burden casted upon it.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">    20.    Against this the accused has given his\n\ndefense evidence as DW.1. Accused has stated in his\n\nevidence that, he has not borrowed any loan amount\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                             21</span>\n\n\n\n\nfrom   the   Bank,   nor   he    has   given   cheque   for\n\nRs.3,28,000/-. Accused further stated that, after the\n\ndeath of his father the President and Manager of the\n\ncomplainant-Bank came to his house and informed\n\nthat, Rs.1,50,000/- loan was taken by his father. Then\n\naccused voluntarily told them that, there is one more\n\nbrother and a sister to him.     He will pay his share of\n\nRs.50,000/-, Bank officials took a blank cheque and\n\nstated that they will decide in this regard in the Bank\n\nmeeting. But surprisingly he came to know that the said\n\ncheque was filled by Bank employees for Rs.3,28,000/-\n\nand a false case has been filed.        DW.1 was cross-\n\nexamined at length. Accused has denied suggestions\n\nthat he is the karta of the family and he is liable to pay\n\nthe amount which is new case made out in cross-\n\nexamination. DW.1 has denied suggestion that, he has\n\nadmitted his liability to pay the entire amount. Accused\n\nhas stated that, the Bank official have cheated him and\n\nby playing fraud on him the Ex.P.1-cheque was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                               22</span>\n\n\n\n\nobtained.     Evidence   of        DW.1   clearly    rebutted\n\npresumption if any on issuance of cheque and prove\n\nthat, case filed by the complainant is not tenable in the\n\neye of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">       21.    On   perusal    of    the   evidence   of   the\n\ncomplainant and defense evidence of accused it is\n\nevident that, the complainant has lodged this complaint\n\nby pleading false contention that the accused has\n\nborrowed the loan. The statutory legal notice was also\n\nissued stating that, accused has borrowed the loan and\n\nEx.P.1-cheque issued in discharge of the said loan was\n\ndishonoured. The complainant has also contended in\n\nwritten complaint that, the accused issued the cheque\n\nin discharge of his liability of borrowing the loan from\n\ncomplainant-Bank. In fact the evidence of the Manager\n\nof the Bank /PW.1 is also to that effect which is\n\nadmittedly not true. Now complainant Bank has totally\n\ngiven &#x27;U&#x27; turn to the contents of the complaint and legal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                            23</span>\n\n\n\n\nnotice, in cross-examination of PW.1 stating that the\n\naccused being a Karta of the family has admitted the\n\nloan borrowed by his father and for discharge of that\n\nloan he has issued the cheque which is not their case at\n\nall. The party cannot be permitted to plead one case in\n\ncomplaint evidence and document and try to take\n\nshelter in cross-examination taking totally new stand\n\nwhich is not pleaded. No Bank statements or account\n\nextract in respect of loan was produced to show that,\n\nwhat was the loan borrowed by accused father, what\n\nwas the amount due, what is the basis for arriving at a\n\nfigure of Rs.3,28,000/- as amount due, is           not\n\nforthcoming. In fact according to the complainant/PW.1\n\nthe loan was of the year 2001. So it has already become\n\ntime barred long back. The father of the accused died\n\nin the year 2004. If at all there was any such loan it\n\nhas become time barred during his life time only.\n\nDefense evidence of accused totally falsify the case of\n\nthe complainant. The slightest presumption even if any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                 24</span>\n\n\n\n\nfor issuance of cheque, stood clearly rebutted by\n\naccused defense evidence apart from rebutting the same\n\nthough cross-examination of PW.1 and PW.2.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">        22.   It is necessary to refer principles of law\n\nstated by High Courts and Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court for\n\nappreciating the evidence in this type of cases. In a\n\ndecision reported in KCCR 2009 (3)             1273 in case of\n\nP.Sathnarayan Vs Jaiteerth this High court held that,\n\nwhen the complainant being guilty of suppression of\n\ntrue facts he is not entitled for penal action against the\n\naccused. In para 10 it is held as under: -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">  10.       As held by the Apex Court in the decisions referred to\n          above, complainant is expected to lay absolute proof\n          without any scope for doubt. The documents produced by\n          the accused in the instant case are enough to show by\n          preponderance of possibilities that the transaction was\n          not as stated by the complainant but it was between\n          complainant&#x27;s father and the accused. In such\n          circumstances, the complainant being guilty of\n          suppression of these facts, would not be entitled to penal\n          action against the accused. Moreover, <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 138</a> being\n          penal and consequence being sentence of imprisonment,\n          stricter proof is required. I notice no such proof of\n          allegations in the complaint. The trial court has\n          misapplied the evidence of the accused and had a\n          negative approach while appreciating evidence.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                 25</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">    In this case also there is total suppression of facts\n\n  by complainant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">     23.    When there is no debt or liability exists, then\n\nthe said cheque amount will not become legally\n\nrecoverable debt or other liability, the offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_26\">section 138</a> of Negotiable Instrument Act will not\n\nsustain. In this regard there is decision of this High\n\nCourt reported in 2018(2) AKR 440 in the case of Branch\n\nManager, PCA &amp; RD Bank Ltd., Belthangady vs. Suresh\n\nGanapathi Das wherein at para-6 it is held as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       &quot;6. On hearing the learned counsel for the parties\n     and on evaluating the material on record, I find that\n     there is no illegality committed by the Trial Court,\n     which calls for interference. It is to be seen that the\n     cheque was not issued by the accused - respondent\n     towards a legally recoverable debt. It was issued as a\n     security for the loan which he had borrowed from the\n     complainant. This is further fortified by the judgment\n     relied on by the counsel for the appellant himself in\n     Sampelly Satyanarayana Rao (supra), which reads\n     that,\n         &quot;If on the date of the cheque liability or debt exists\n     or the amount has become legally recoverable, the\n     Section is attracted and not otherwise.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">         Hence, it is proved that as on the date of issuance\n     of the blank cheque, there was no legal liability of the\n     accused to pay any amount to the complainant, which\n     is evident from the evidence of PW-1 the Manager of\n     the bank himself. Further, the complainant - Bank has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                26</span>\n\n\n\n\n      also not produced any account extract relating to the\n      loan account of the accused.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">       24.     The learned counsel for the complainant\n\ntried to make out a case under <a href=\"/doc/1266802/\" id=\"a_27\">section 25 (3)</a> of the\n\nIndian Contract Act 1872 stating that as the accused\n\nissued the cheque it amounts to admission on the part\n\nof the accused to pay the time barred debt. But such a\n\ncontention is not legally tenable. It is not the case of the\n\ncomplainant or the evidence of PW.1 or contents of the\n\nlegal notice that the cheque was issued in discharge of\n\nfather&#x27;s debt or liability. There is no undertaking or\n\ndocument executed by accused promising to pay time\n\nbarred debt or liability of his father. The learned counsel\n\nalso argued that, it is also the pious obligation on the\n\npart of the accused to pay the debt of his father. Hindu\n\nLaw states that, there is a pious obligation on the sons,\n\ngrand sons and great grand sons to pay ancestors debt\n\nto the extent of their interest in the joint family\n\nproperty.    But the said liability is not a personal one.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                27</span>\n\n\n\n\nThe father&#x27;s creditor is not entitled to proceed against\n\nthe person or the separate property of children it is\n\nlimited to the interest in the joint family property. The\n\nlearned Author Mulla Hindu Law by Sir.Dinshaw Fardunji\n\nMulla,   22nd Edition at page No.441 considered the\n\nduration of the liability. It is observed as under by the\n\nlearned author.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">           Duration of liability:- The pious obligation of the\n           sons to pay the father&#x27;s debts lasts only so long as\n           the liability of the father subsists. If the debts are\n           saved       from    limitation    by     the    father&#x27;s\n           acknowledgment, the sons is bound to pay, even\n           though the acknowledgement by the father is after\n           a partition between the father and the son. The\n           son&#x27;s liability is neither joint nor joint and several,\n           as those terms are ordinarily understood in\n           English law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">  25. The accused herein is not the only legal heir of\n\nhis father, nor it is shown that, he has inherited any\n\nproperty of father. The said obligation even if any was\n\nnot within the period of limitation. It is only a moral\n\nobligation and the liability if any is at the most civil\n\nliability on the legal heirs of the deceased if the time\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                   28</span>\n\n\n\n\nbarred debt was acknowledged by their father. PW.1\n\nadmits that loan was of the year 2001.                The father of\n\naccused died in the year 2004. So the said loan had\n\nbecome time barred long back. The provision of <a href=\"/doc/1266802/\" id=\"a_28\">Section\n\n25(3)</a> of Contract Act are not at all attracted to this case.\n\nTherefore viewed from any angle if the contents of the\n\ncomplaint and the oral and documentary evidence are\n\nconsidered then no case is made out to show that there\n\nwas any legally recoverable debt or liability on the part\n\nof the accused or accused is liable for any panel action\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_29\">section 138</a> of N.I Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"6025602\" id=\"span_29\">26.     The learned counsel for appellant relied on\n\ndecision of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court reported in (2016) 3\n\nSCC 1 in case of <a href=\"/doc/6025602/\" id=\"a_30\">Don Ayengia Vs State of Assam and\n\nanother</a> at para No.11 it is held as under:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      11.     We have no hesitation in answering that question in\n            the affirmative. The facts as narrated above and as held\n            proved by the trial Court and the appellate court, leave\n            no manner of doubt, that Nazimul Islam had received\n            an amount of rupees ten lakhs from the complainant in\n            connection with the agreement executed between the\n            two. It is also not in dispute that upon termination of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                29</span>\n\n\n\n\n         agreement, the amount paid to Nazimul Islam was\n         refundable to the complainant and that Nazimul Islam\n         had agreed to refund the same within one month. The\n         promissory note executed by Nazimul Islam contained\n         an unequivocal acknowledgment of not only the\n         debt/liability aforementioned but promised to liquidate\n         the same within one month with interest at the bank\n         rate. Five cheques handed over were to be returned but\n         only upon payment of the amount in question. Such\n         being the fact situation, it cannot be said that the\n         cheques had nothing to do with any debt or other\n         liability. As a matter of fact, the existence of the debt or\n         liability was never in dispute. On the contrary, it was\n         acknowledged by Nazimul Islam who simply sought one\n         month&#x27;s time to pay up the amount. The cheques were\n         post dated, only to give to the drawer the specified one\n         month&#x27;s time to pay the amount. There is thus a direct\n         relationship between the liability and the cheques\n         issued in connection therewith. Thus far there is no\n         difficulty.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"6025602\" id=\"span_31\">27. The fact of that case and principles stated above\n\nhave no application to this case. Because <a href=\"/doc/6025602/\" id=\"a_31\">in that case</a>\n\nthe promissory note was executed and it contained\n\nunequivocal acknowledgement of not only debt or\n\nliability and cheques were issued relation to continuing\n\ncontractual business.      The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court at\n\npara No.13 has clearly held that, the existence of debt\n\nor liability was never in dispute and there was\n\nacknowledgement and promise made to pay within one\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                             30</span>\n\n\n\n\nmonth, failure on the part of debtor the cheques were to\n\nbe presented for payment of the said debt. There was\n\nendorsement made on the promissory note that the\n\ncheque can be presented for acknowledgment after\n\nstipulated date.   So in view of that endorsement the\n\naccused was held liable. But herein this case there is\n\nno debt or liability either determined or acknowledged to\n\nbe payable. The loan was neither borrowed by accused\n\nas contended in the complaint, in the legal notice, nor\n\naccused has given any express undertaking or promised\n\nto pay any time barred      debt liability of his father.\n\nAccused is under no legal obligation in this case to pay\n\nany debt of his father. The question payment of time\n\nbarred debt was neither pleaded nor involved. The said\n\ndecision is not on the point of <a href=\"/doc/1266802/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 25(3)</a> of the\n\nIndian Contract Act 1872.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"53206885\" id=\"span_33\">28.

In that\n\ncase, since there were glaring inconsistencies in the\n\ncomplainant&#x27;s case, the conviction was set aside holding\n\nthat the defense version succeeded in dislodging the\n\ncomplainant&#x27;s case on the strength of convincing\n\nevidence and discharging the burden envisaged under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1177058/\" id=\"a_35\">sections 118(a)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/268919/\" id=\"a_36\">139</a> of N.I Act.

Nothing short of an\n     express promise, therefore, will provide a fresh period\n     of limitation. It is settled law that an implied promise is\n     not sufficient. The learned Division Bench also noted\n     the distinction between an acknowledgement under\n     <a href=\"/doc/85586/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 18</a> of the Limitation Act, 1963 and promise to\n     pay under <a href=\"/doc/1266802/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 25(3)</a> of the Contract Act, 1872.\n     Both have got to be in writing.

The definition of promissory note as stated in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/148539/\" id=\"a_80\">section 4</a> of the N.I Act indicates that, it contains an\n\nunconditional undertaking signed by the maker, to pay\n\na sum of money only to, or to the order of, a certain\n\nperson, or to the bearer of instrument. The definition of\n\n&quot;bill of exchange&quot; as stated in <a href=\"/doc/6856/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 5</a> and the\n\ndefinition of cheque contain only an unconditional order\n\nwhich clearly distinguish them from the definition of\n\npromissory note. In promissory note there must be an\n\nexpress undertaking upon the face of instrument to pay\n\nthe   money.    Therefore   in   promissory    there   is\n\nunconditional undertaking i.e., promise to pay, but the\n\ndefinition of bill of exchange and cheque contain only an\n\nunconditional order. This distinction needs to be kept in\n\nmind while considering whether the cheque itself\n\nconstitutes a promise in writing by the accused so as to\n\nbring that cheque within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1339273/\" id=\"a_82\">section 25 (3)</a> of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                               42</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_83\">Indian Contract Act</a> 1872 and penal provision under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_84\">section 138</a> of N.I Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">  38.

Based on the evidence and\n\nthe principles referred the trial court has come to a\n\nconclusion that, the complainant has failed to establish\n\nexistence of legally recoverable debt. The trial court has\n\nrightly held that mere issuance of cheque without\n\ncorresponding legally recoverable debt is not an offence.\n\nThe trial court has rightly come to conclusion that the\n\ncomplainant has not established his case and no\n\npresumption arise in his favour. The trial court rightly\n\nacquitted the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">      41.    In view of the above, absolutely there is no\n\nground to interfere with the judgment of acquittal\n\npassed by the trial court.    The appeal being devoid of\n\nmerits is liable to be dismissed. Accordingly I proceed to\n\npass the following:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">                         ORDER\n      Criminal Appeal filed by the complainant is\n\ndismissed.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                             45</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      The Judgment of acquittal of accused passed by I\n\nAddl.
