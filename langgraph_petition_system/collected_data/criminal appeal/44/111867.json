Though  the section imposes restrictions on\nthe fundamental freedom of\n770\nspeech and expression, the restrictions are in the\ninterest of  public order and are within the ambit\nof permissible\tlegislative interference  with the\nfundamental right.  There is  a\t conflict  on  the\nquestion of  the ambit of<a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_3\"> s. 124A</a> between decision\nof the federal Court and of the Privy Council. The\nFederal\t Court\thas  held  that\t words,\t deeds\tor\nwritings constituted an offence under<a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_4\"> s. 124A</a> only\nwhen they had the intention or tendency to disturb\npublic tranquility.  to create\tpublic disturbance\nor to  promote disorder,  whilst the Privy Council\nhas taken  the view  that it  was not an essential\ningredient of  the offence  of sedition\t under<a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_5\">\ts.\n124A</a> that  the words etc, should be intended to or\nbe likely  to incite  public disorder. Either view\ncan be taken and supported on good reasons. If the\nview taken  by the  Federal Court  was accepted<a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_6\"> s.\n124A</a> would  be use  constitutional but if the view\nof the\tPrivy Council  was accepted  it\t would\tbe\nunconstitutional.  It  is  well\t settled  that\tif\ncertain provisions  of law  construed in  one  way\nwould make  them consistent with the constitution,\nand  another   interpretation  would  render  them\nunconstitutional, the  Court would  lean in favour\nof the\tformer construction.  Keeping in  mind the\nreasons for  the introduction  of<a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_7\"> s.  124A</a> and the\nhistory\t of   sedition\tthe  section  must  be\tso\nconstrued as  to limit\tits  application  to  acts\ninvolving  intention   or   tendency   to   create\ndisorder, or  disturbance of  law  and\torder;\tor\nincitement to violence.\n     Niharendu\tDutt  Majumdar\tv.

The section corresponding to<a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_62\"> s.\n124A</a> was  originally<a href=\"/doc/714962/\" id=\"a_63\"> s.\t 113</a> of\t Macaulay&#x27;s  Draft\nPenal Code of 1837-39, but the section was omitted\nfrom the  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_64\">Indian Penal\tCode</a> as\t it was enacted in\n1860. The reason for the omission from the Code is\nenacted is  not clear, but perhaps the legislative\nbody did  not feel  sure above\tits  authority\tto\nenact such  a provision in the Code. Be that as it\nmay, s.\t 124A was  not placed  on the Statute Book\nuntil 1870, by Act XXVII of 1870. There\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">784</span>\nwas a  considerable amount  of discussion  at  the\ntime the  amendment was\t introduced by\tSir James,\nStephen, but  what he  said while  introducing the\nbill in\t the legislature  may not  be relevant for\nour present  purposes.

The meaning of the two\n     words is  so distinct  that I  feel it hardly\n     necessary to  tell you that the contention of\n     Mr. Jackson  cannot be sustained. If a person\n     uses   either   spoken   or   written   words\n     calculated to  create in  the  minds  of  the\n     persons  to   whom\t they\tare  addressed\t a\n     disposition not  to obey the lawful authority\n     of the  Government, or  to subvert\t or resist\n     that authority,  if and  when occasion should\n     arise, and\t if he\tdoes so with the intention\n     of creating such a disposition in his bearers\n     or readers,  he will be guilty of the offence\n     of attempting  to excite  disaffection within\n     the  meaning   of\tthe   section  though\tno\n     disturbance is  brought about by his words or\n     any  feeling   of\tdisaffection,\tin   fact,\n     produced by  them.

I agree\n     with Sir Comer Petheram in the Bangobasi case\n     that disaffection means simply the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">786</span>\n     absence of affection. It means hatred, enmity\n     dislike, hostility,  contempt and\tevery from\n     of ill-will  to the  Government. &quot;Disloyalty&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     is\t  perhaps    the   best\t   general   term,\n     comprehending  every  possible  form  of  bad\n     feeling to\t the Government.

In the\n     next  place,   it\tis  absolutely\timmaterial\n     whether any  feelings  of\tdisaffection  have\n     been excited  or not  by the  publication\tin\n     question. It is true that there is before you\n     a charge  against each  prisoner that  he has\n     actually excited  feelings of disaffection to\n     the Government.  If you are satisfied that he\n     has done  so, you\twill, of  course, find him\n     guilty. But if you should hold that charge is\n     not made  out, and\t that no  one is proved to\n     have been\texcited to  entertain feelings\tof\n     disaffection to  the  Government  by  reading\n     these articles,  still that  alone would  not\n     justify you  in acquitting the prisoners. For\n     each  of\tthem  is  charged  not\tonly  with\n     exciting feelings\tof disaffection,  but also\n     with attempting  to excite such feelings. You\n     will   observe   that   section   places\ton\n     absolutely the  same footing  the\tsuccessful\n     exciting of  feelings of disaffection and the\n     unsuccessful attempt to excite them, so that,\n     if you  find that either of the prisoners has\n     tried to  excite such  feeling in others, you\n     must convict  him even if there is nothing to\n     show that he succeeded. Again, it is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">787</span>\n     important\tthat   you  should  fully  realise\n     another  point.   The  offence   consists\tin\n     exciting or  attempting to\t excite in  others\n     certain bad  feeling towards  the Government.\n     It is  not\t the  exciting\tor  attempting\tto\n     excite mutiny  or rebellion,  or any  sort of\n     actual disturbance,  great or  small. Whether\n     any disturbance  or outbreak  was\tcaused\tby\n     there articles,  is absolutely immaterial. If\n     the  accused  intended  by\t the  articles\tto\n     excite  rebellion\tor  disturbance,  his  act\n     would doubtless fall within <a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_66\">section 124A</a>, and\n     would probably  fall within other sections of\n     the  Penal\t Code.\tBut  even  if  he  neither\n     excited nor  intended to excite any rebellion\n     or outbreak  or forcible  resistance  to  the\n     authority of  the\tGovernment,  still  if\the\n     tried to  excite feelings\tof enmity  to  the\n     Government, that  is sufficient  to make  him\n     guilty under  the section.\t I am  aware  that\n     some distinguished\t persons have thought that\n     there can\tbe no  offence against the section\n     unless  the   accused  either   counsels\tor\n     suggests rebellion\t or forcible resistance to\n     the Government.  In my  opinion, that view is\n     absolutely opposed\t to the\t express words\tof\n     the  section  itself,  which  as  plainly\tas\n     possible makes  the exciting or attempting to\n     excite certain feelings, and not the inducing\n     or attempting  to induce  to  any\tcourse\tof\n     action  such   as\t rebellion   or\t  forcible\n     resistance, the  test of  guilt. I\t can  only\n     account for  such a view by attributing it to\n     a\tcomplete  misreading  of  the  explanation\n     attached\tto   the   section,   and   to\t a\n     misapplication of\tthe explanation beyond its\n     true scope.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">The long quotation has become necessary in view of\nwhat followed  later, namely,  that this statement\nof the\tlaw by\tthe learned  judge came\t in for\t a\ngreat deal of comment and judicial notice. We have\nomitted the charge to the jury relating\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">788</span>\nto  the\t  explanation  to  s.  124A  because  that\nexplanation  has   now\tyielded\t  place\t to  three\nseparate explanations in view of judicial opinions\nexpressed later. The jury, by a majority of six to\nthree,\tfound\tShri  Balgangadhar  Tilak  guilty.\nSubsequently, he, on conviction, applied under cl.\n41 of  the Letters  Patent for\tleave to appeal to\nthe Privy  Council. The application was heard by a\nFull Bench  consisting of Farran, C. J., Candy and\nStrachey, JJ.  It was  contended before\t the  High\nCourt at  the leave  stage, inter  alia, that  the\nsanction  given\t  by  the   Government\t was   not\nsufficient in  law in  that it had not set out the\nparticulars  of\t  the  offending   articles,  and,\nsecondly, that\tthe judge  misdirected the jury as\nto the\tmeaning of the word &quot;disaffection&quot; insofar\nas he said that it might be equivalent to &quot;absence\nof affection&quot;.\tWith regard  to the  second point,\nwhich is  only relevant\t point before us; the Full\nBench expressed itself to the following effect:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\t  &quot;The other ground upon which Mr. Russell\n     has asked\tas to  certify that  this is a fit\n     case to be sent to Her Majesty in Council, is\n     that there\t has been  a misdirection,  and he\n     based his argument on one major and two minor\n     grounds.  The   major  ground  was\t that  the\n     section  cannot   be  said\t  to   have   been\n     contravened  unless   there   is\ta   direct\n     incitement to  stir up disorder or rebellion.\n     That appears  to us  to be\t going much beyond\n     the words of the section, and we need not say\n     more upon that ground. The first of the minor\n     points  is\t  that\tMr.  Justice  Strachey\tin\n     summing up\t the case  to the jury stated that\n     disaffection meant the absence of affection&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">     But although  if that  phrase had stood alone\n     it might  have misled  the jury, yet taken in\n     connection with  the context  we think  it is\n     impossible that  the  jury\t could\thave  been\n     misled by\tit. That  expression was  used\tin\n     connection with the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">789</span>\n     law as  led down  by Sir  Comer Petheram,\tin\n     Calcutta in  the Bangobashi  case. There  the\n     Chief Justice  instead  of\t using\tthe  words\n     &quot;absence  of   affection&quot;\tused   the   words\n     &quot;contrary\tto   affection&quot;.  If   the   words\n     &quot;contrary to affection&quot; had been used instead\n     of &quot;absence  of affection&quot; in this case there\n     can be  no doubt  that the\t summing up  would\n     have  been\t  absolutely   correct\t in   this\n     particular. But  taken in connection with the\n     context  it   is  clear  that  by\tthe  words\n     &quot;absence of  affection&quot; the learned Judge did\n     not mean  the negation  of affection but some\n     active sentiment on the other side. Therefore\n     on that  point we\tconsider  that\twe  cannot\n     certify that this is a fit case for appeal.&quot;\n\t  In this connection it must be remembered\n     that it  is not alleged that there has been a\n     miscarriage of Justice.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_38\">After making  those observations,  the Full  Bench\nrefused the  application for  leave. the  case was\nthen taken  to Her  Majesty in\tcouncil, by way of\napplication for\t special leave\tto appeal  to  the\nJudicial Committee.  Before their Lordships of the\nPrivy Council, Asquith, Q. C., assisted by counsel\nof great experience and eminence like Mayne, W.

It   was   also   contended\tthat   the\nappellant&#x27;s comments\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">790</span>\nhad  not   exceeded  what   in\tEngland\t would\tbe\nconsidered  within   the  functions  of\t a  Public\njournalist, and\t that the  misdirection complained\nof was\tof the\tgreatest importance  not merely to\nthe affected person but to the whole of the Indian\nPress and  also to all her Majesty&#x27;s subjects; and\nthat it\t injuriously affected  the liberty  of the\npress and  the right  to  free\tspeech\tin  public\nmeetings. But  in spite\t of the strong appeal made\non behalf of the petitioner for special leave, the\nLord Chancellor,  delivering the  opinion  of  the\nJudicial   Committee,\t while\t dismissing    the\napplication, observed  that taking  a view  of the\nwhole of  the summing  up they\tdid  not  see  any\nreason to  dissent from\t it, and  that keeping\tin\nview the  rules which  Their Lordships observed in\nthe matter of granting leave to appeal in criminal\ncases, they  did not  think   that the case raised\nquestions which\t deserve further  consideration by\nthe Privy  Council.</span> (vide Gangadhar Tilak v.

Amba\tPrasad</a> (2).  In that case,\nEdge, C.J.,  who delivered  the\t judgment  of  the\nCourt, made  copious quotations from the judgments\nof the\tCalcutta and the Bombay High Courts in the\ncases above  referred to. While generally adopting\nthe reasons for the decisions in the aforesaid two\ncases, the  learned Chief  Justice observed that a\nman may\t be guilty  of the  offence defined  in<a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_70\"> s.\n124A</a>  of   attempting  to   excite   feelings\tof\ndisaffection against the Government established by\nlaw in\tBritish India,\talthough in  a\tparticular\narticle\t or   speech  he   may\tinsist\t upon  the\ndesirability  or   expediency\tof   obeying   and\nsupporting the\tGovernment. He also made reference\nto the\tdecision of  the Bombay\t High Court in the\nSatara (3)  case.  In  that  case  a  Full  Bench,\nconsisting  of\t Farran,  C.J.,\t and  Parsons  and\nRanade, JJ,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">791</span>\nhad laid  it down  that the word &quot;disaffection&quot; in\nthe section  is used in a special sense as meaning\npolitical alienation  or discontent  or disloyalty\nto the Government or existing authority. They also\nheld that  the meaning\tof word\t &quot;disaffection&quot; in\nthe main  portion of the section was not varied by\nthe explanation.  Persons, J.,\theld that the word\n&quot;disaffection&quot; could  not be  construed as meaning\n&#x27;absence of  or contrary  of affection\tor  love&#x27;.\nRanade J., interpreted the word &quot;disaffection&quot; not\nas meaning  mere absence  or negation  of love\tor\ngood will  but a  positive  feeling  of\t aversion,\nwhich  is   akin   to\till   will,   a\t  definite\ninsubordination\t of   authority\t or   seeking\tto\nalienate  the\tpeople\tand  weaken  the  bond\tof\nallegiance, a  feeling which  tends to\tbring  the\nGovernment into hatred and discontent, by imputing\nbase and  corrupt motives to it. The learned Chief\nJustice of  the Allahabad High Court observed that\nif those  remarks were\tmeant to  be in\t any sense\ndifferent from\tthe construction  placed upon  the\nsection by  Strachey, J.,  which was  approved, as\naforesaid, by  the Judicial Committee of the Privy\nCouncil, the later observations of the Bombay High\nCourt could  not be  treated as\t authoritative.</span> As\nthe accused  in the  Allahabad\tcase  had  pleaded\nguilty and  the appeal\twas more  or less  on  the\nquestion of  sentence, it  was not  necessary  for\ntheir  Lordships   to  examine\t in   detail   the\nimplications of the section, though they expressed\ntheir general  agreement  with\tthe  view  of  the\nCalcutta and  the Bombay  High Courts in the first\ntwo cases, referred to above.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     The section  was amended  by the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_71\">Indian Penal\nCode Amendment\tAct</a> (IV\t of 1898).  As a result of\nthe  amendment,\t the  single  explanation  to  the\nsection\t  was\t replaced   by\t  three\t  separate\nexplanations as they stand now. The section, as it\nnow stands  in its  present form, is the result of\nthe several  A.O.S. of\t1937, 1948  and 1950, as a\nresult\tof  the\t constitutional\t changes,  by  the\n<a href=\"/doc/93056159/\" id=\"a_72\">Government of India Act, 1935</a>, by the Independence\nAct of 1947 and by the Indian\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">792</span>\nConstitution of\t 1950.

This  species of offence against the State\nwas not an invention of the British. Government in\nIndia,\tbut   has  been\t  known\t in   England  for\ncenturies.

It\tis to this\n     aspect of the functions of government that in\n     our opinion  the offence  of sedition  stands\n     related. It  is the  answer of  the State\tto\n     those who,\t for the  purpose of  attacking or\n     subverting\t it,  seek  (to\t borrow\t from  the\n     passage   cited   above)\tto   disturb   its\n     tranquillity, to  create  public  disturbance\n     and to promote disorder, or who incite others\n     to do so. Words, deeds or writings constitute\n     sedition, if they have this intention or this\n     tendency; and  it is easy to see why they may\n     also constitute  sedition, if  they seek,\tas\n     the  phrase  is,  to  bring  Government  into\n     contempt.

Hence\nthe  continued\t existence   of\t  the\tGovernment\nestablished by\tlaw is\tan essential  condition of\nthe  stability\t of  the   State.  That\t  is   why\n&#x27;sedition&#x27;, as\tthe offence  in s.  124A has  been\ncharacterised, comes  under Chapter VI relating to\noffences against  the State. Hence any acts within\nthe meaning  of s.  124A which\thave the effect of\nsubverting  the\t  Government  by   bringing   that\nGovernment into\t contempt or  hatred, or  creating\ndisaffection against it, would be within the penal\nstatute because\t the feeling  of disloyalty to the\nGovernment established\tby law\tor  enmity  to\tit\nimports the idea of tendency to public disorder by\nthe  use  of  actual  violence\tor  incitement\tto\nviolence. In  other words,  any written\t or spoken\nwords, etc.,  which have implicit in them the idea\nof subverting  Government by  violent means, which\nare   compendiously    included\t  in\tthe   term\n&#x27;revolution&#x27;, have  been made penal by the section\nin question.  But the  section has  taken care\tto\nindicate clearly that strong words used to express\ndisapprobation of  the measures of Government with\na view\tto  their  improvement\tor  alteration\tby\nlawful means  would not\t come within  the section.\nSimilarly, comments,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">806</span>\nhowever strongly worded, expressing disapprobation\nof actions  of the  Government,\t without  exciting\nthose feelings\twhich generate\tthe inclination to\ncause public  disorder by  acts of violence, would\nnot  be\t penal.\t In  other  words,  disloyalty\tto\nGovernment established\tby law\tis  not\t the  same\nthing as  commenting  in  strong  terms\t upon  the\nmeasures or  acts of  Government, or its agencies,\nso as to ameliorate the condition of the people or\nto secure  the cancellation or alteration of those\nacts or\t measures by lawful means, that is to say,\nwithout exciting  those\t feelings  of  enmity  and\ndisloyalty  which   imply  excitement\tto  public\ndisorder or the use of violence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">     It has not been contended before us that if a\nspeech or  a writing excites people to violence or\nhave the  tendency to  create public  disorder, it\nwould  not   come   within   the   definition\tof\n&#x27;sedition&#x27;. What  has been  contended  is  that\t a\nperson who makes a very strong speech or uses very\nvigorous words\tin a  writing directed\tto a  very\nstrong criticism of measures of Government or acts\nof public  officials, might  also come\twithin the\nambit of  the penal  section. But, in our opinion,\nsuch words  written or spoken would be outside the\nscope of  the section.\tIn this\t connection, it is\npertinent to  observe that  the\t security  of  the\nState, which  depends upon  the maintenance of law\nand order  is the  very basic  consideration  upon\nwhich  legislation,   with  a  view  to\t punishing\noffences against  the State, is undertaken. Such a\nlegislation has, on the one hand, fully to protect\nand  guarantee\t the   freedom\t of   speech   and\nexpression,  which  is\tthe  sine  quo\tnon  of\t a\ndemocratic   form    of\t  Government\tthat   our\nConstitution has  established. This  Court, as the\ncustodian and  guarantor of the fundamental rights\nof the\tcitizens, has  the duty\t cast upon  it\tof\nstriking down  any law\twhich unduly restricts the\nfreedom of speech and expression with which we are\nconcerned in  this case. But the freedom has to be\nguarded again\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">807</span>\nbecoming   a\tlicence\t  for\tvilification   and\ncondemnation of the Government established by law,\nin  words   which  incite  violence  or\t have  the\ntendency to  create public disorder. A citizen has\na right\t to say\t or write  whatever he likes about\nthe  Government,   or  its  measures,  by  way\tof\ncriticism or  comment, so  long\t as  he\t does  not\nincite people  to violence  against the Government\nestablished  by\t law  or  with\tthe  intention\tof\ncreating  public   disorder.   The   Court,   has,\ntherefore, the\tduty cast  upon it  of\tdrawing\t a\nclear line  of demarcation  between the ambit of a\ncitizen&#x27;s fundamental  right guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_122\">Art.\n19(1)(a)</a> of  the Constitution and the power of the\nlegislature to\timpose reasonable  restrictions on\nthat guaranteed\t right in  the interest\t of, inter\nalia, security\tof the\tState and public order. We\nhave, therefore, to determine how far the<a href=\"/doc/1641007/\" id=\"a_123\"> ss. 124A</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1198526/\" id=\"a_124\">505</a>\t of the Indian Penal Code could be said to\nbe within  the justifiable  limits of legislation.\nIf it  is  held,  in  consonance  with\tthe  views\nexpressed by  the Federal  Court in  the  case\tof\nNiharendu Dutt\tmajumdar v.  The  King\tEmperor(1)\nthat the  gist of  the offence\tof  &#x27;sedition&#x27;\tis\nincitement to  violence or  the\t tendency  or  the\nintention  to  create  public  disorder\t by  words\nspoken or  written, which have the tendency or the\neffect of  bringing the\t Government established by\nlaw  into   hatred   or\t  contempt   or\t  creating\ndisaffection in\t the sense  of disloyalty  to  the\nState in  other words  bringing the  law into line\nwith the  law of  sedition in  England, as was the\nintention of  the legislators when they introduced\ns. 124A\t into the  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_125\">Indian Penal\t Code</a> in  1870\tas\naforesaid, the\tlaw will be within the permissible\nlimits <a href=\"/doc/553290/\" id=\"a_126\">laid  down in</a>  cl. (2)  of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_127\">Art.\t19</a> of  the\nConstitution, if  on the  other\t hand  we  give\t a\nliteral meaning\t to  the  words\t of  the  section,\ndivorced from  all the\tantecedent  background\tin\nwhich the  law of sedition has grown, as <a href=\"/doc/553290/\" id=\"a_128\">laid down\nin</a> the several decisions of the Judicial Committee\nof the Privy Council, it will be true to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">808</span>\nsay that  the section  is not only within but also\nvery much  beyond the  limits <a href=\"/doc/553290/\" id=\"a_129\">laid down in</a> cl.

If  we accept the interpretation\nof the Federal Court as to the gist of criminality\nin  an\t alleged  crime\t  of   sedition,   namely,\nincitement to  disorder or  tendency or likelihood\nof  public  disorder  or  reasonable  apprehension\nthereof, the  section may  lie within the ambit of\npermissible  legislative   restrictions\t  on   the\nfundamental  right   of\t freedom   of  speech  and\nexpression. There  can be no doubt that apart from\nthe provisions of (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_134\">Art. 19</a>, ss. 124A and 505\nare clearly  violative of  <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_135\">Art.\t 19(1)(a)</a>  of  the\nConstitution. But  then we have to see how far the\nsaving clause,\tnamely, cl.(2) of <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_136\">Art. 19</a> protects\nthe sections  aforesaid.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1475436\" id=\"span_67\">Now,  as already  pointed\nout, in\t terms of  the\tamended\t cl.  (2),  quoted\nabove, the expression &quot;in the interest of...public\norder&quot; are  words of  great amplitude and are much\nmore comprehensive  than the  expression &quot;for  the\nmaintenance of&quot;,  as observed by this Court in the\ncase of\t <a href=\"/doc/1475436/\" id=\"a_137\">Virendra v.  The State of Punjab</a> (1). Any\nlaw which  is enacted  in the  interest of  public\norder may be saved from the vice of constitutional\ninvalidity. If, on the other hand, we were to hold\nthat even  without any\ttendency  to  disorder\tor\nintention to  create disturbance of law and order,\nby the use of words written or spoken which merely\ncreate disaffection  or feelings of enmity against\nthe  Government,   the\toffence\t  of  sedition\tis\ncomplete,  then\t such  an  interpretation  of  the\nsections would\tmake them unconstitutional in view\nof <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_138\">Art.\t 19(1)(a)</a> read\twith cl.  (2). It  is well\nsettled\t that\tif  certain   provisions  of   law\nconstrued in one way would make\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">809</span>\nthem consistent with the Constitution, and another\ninterpretation would render them unconstitutional,\nthe Court  would lean  in  favour  of  the  former\nconstruction. The  provisions of the sections read\nas a  whole, along  with the explanations, make it\nreasonably  clear   that  the\tsections  aim\tat\nrendering penal\t only such  activities as would be\nintended, or  have a  tendency, to create disorder\nor  disturbance\t of  public  peace  by\tresort\tto\nviolence. As already pointed out, the explanations\nappended to  the main  body of the section make it\nclear that criticism of public measures or comment\non Government  action,\thowever\t strongly  worded,\nwould be  within reasonable  limits and\t would\tbe\nconsistent with\t the fundamental  right of freedom\nof speech  and expression.  It is  only\t when  the\nwords, written\tor spoken,  etc.  which\t have  the\npernicious  tendency   or  intention  of  creating\npublic disorder\t or disturbance\t of law\t and order\nthat the  law steps  in to prevent such activities\nin the interest of public order. So construed, the\nsection,  in  our  opinion,  strikes  the  correct\nbalance between\t individual fundamental rights and\nthe interest  of public\t order. It  is also   well\nsettled that  in  interpreting\tan  enactment  the\nCourt should have regard not merely to the literal\nmeaning of  the words  used, but  also\ttake  into\nconsideration  the   antecedent\t history   of  the\nlegislation, its purpose and the mischief it seeks\nto  suppress   (vide  (1)).</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"725224\" id=\"span_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"608874\" id=\"span_70\"><a href=\"/doc/608874/\" id=\"a_139\">The  Bengal  Immunity\nCompany Limited\t v.

In  our\nopinion, there\tare decisions  of this Court which\namply justify  our taking  that view  of the legal\nposition.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"725224\" id=\"span_73\">This\t Court,\t in  the  case\tof  <a href=\"/doc/725224/\" id=\"a_142\">R.M.D.\nChamarbaugwalla v.

After  examining those  decisions, this\nCourt came  to the conclusion that if the impugned\nprovisions of a law come within the constitutional\npowers of  the legislature by adopting one view of\nthe words  of the  impugned section  or\t Act,  the\nCourt will  take that view of the matter and limit\nits application\t accordingly, in preference to the\nview  which  would  make  it  unconstitutional\ton\nanother view of the interpretation of the words in\nquestion. In  that case,  the Court  had to choose\nbetween a  definition  of  the\texpression  &#x27;Prize\nCompetitions&quot; as  limited  to  those  competitions\nwhich were of a gambling character and those which\nwere   not.    The   Court    chose   the   former\ninterpretation\twhich\tmade  the   rest  of   the\nprovisions of  the  <a href=\"/doc/654270/\" id=\"a_143\">Act,  Prize\t Competitions  Act</a>\n(XLII of 1955), with particular reference to<a href=\"/doc/129934088/\" id=\"a_144\"> ss. 4</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/70659390/\" id=\"a_145\">5</a>  of the  Act and\tRules  11  and\t12  framed\nthereunder, valid.
