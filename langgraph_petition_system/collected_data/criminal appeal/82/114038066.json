The answer to\n                        the mind of this court is simply no because the time frame\n                        mentioned is to complete the investigations in a time bound\n                        manner but the said time can be extended from time to time by\n                        the same authority.

There are\n                        two provisions in the Code which provide for remand i.e.\n                        <a href=\"/doc/122593777/\" id=\"a_80\">Sections 167</a> and <a href=\"/doc/90473215/\" id=\"a_81\">309</a>.

The act of directing remand of an accused is\n                        fundamentally a judicial function. The Magistrate does not\n                        act in executive capacity while ordering the detention of an\n                        accused. While exercising this judicial act, it is obligatory\n                        on the part of the Magistrate to satisfy himself whether the\n                        materials placed before him justify such a remand or, to put\n                        it differently, whether there exist reasonable grounds to\n                        commit the accused to custody and extend his remand. The\n                        purpose of remand as postulated under <a href=\"/doc/122593777/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 167</a> is that\n                        investigation cannot be completed within 24 hours. It\n                        enables the Magistrate to see that the remand is really\n                        necessary. This requires the investigating agency to send\n                        the case diary along with the remand report so that the\n                        Magistrate can appreciate the factual scenario and apply his\n                        mind whether there is a warrant for police remand or\n                        justification for judicial remand or there is no need for any\n                        remand at all. It is obligatory on the part of the Magistrate\n                        to apply his mind and not to pass an order of remand\n                        automatically or in a mechanical manner.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">                                                 … …        …\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">                        31. Coming to the case at hand, it is evincible that the arrest\n                        had taken place a day prior to the passing of the order of\n                        stay. It is also manifest that the order of remand was passed\n                        by the learned Magistrate after considering the allegations\n                        in the FIR but not in a routine or mechanical manner. It has\n                        to be borne in mind that the effect of the order of the High\n                        Court regarding stay of investigation could only have a\n                        bearing on the action of the investigating agency. The order\n                        of remand which is a judicial act, as we perceive, does not\n                        suffer from any infirmity. The only ground that was\n                        highlighted before the High Court as well as before this\n                        Court is that once there is stay of investigation, the order of\n                        remand is sensitively susceptible and, therefore, as a logical\n                        corollary, the detention is unsustainable. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"59910504\" id=\"span_76\">It is worthy to\n                        note that the investigation had already commenced and as a\n                        resultant consequence, the accused was arrested. Thus, we\n                        are disposed to think that the order of remand cannot be\n                        regarded as untenable in law.

If it was to come to an end, the legislation\n\n        would have contemplated certain results including re-transfer of\n\n        investigation back to the original Investigating Agencies which were\n\n        directed to transfer the entire record under sub-Section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/23112748/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 212</a>.\n\n        In the absence of any clear stipulation, in our view, an interpretation that\n\n        with the expiry of the period, the mandate in favour of SFIO must come\n\n        to an end, will cause great violence to the scheme of legislation. If such\n\n        interpretation is accepted, with the transfer of investigation in terms of\n\n        sub Section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/23112748/\" id=\"a_177\">Section 212</a> the original Investigating Agencies would\n\n        be denuded of power to investigate and with the expiry of mandate SFIO\n\n        would also be powerless which would lead to an incongruous situation\n\n        that serious frauds would remain beyond investigation. That could never\n\n        have been the idea. The only construction which is, possible therefore, is\n\n        that the prescription of period within which a report has to be submitted to\n\n        the Central Government under sub-Section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/23112748/\" id=\"a_178\">Section 212</a> is purely\n\n        directory.

No.35/20-19 may prefer\n                    application for bail and if such an application is preferred,\n                    the concerned court in question may consider the matter on\n                    merits without being influenced by any observations in the\n                    order of the High Court, impugned herein.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_118\">        34.          In view of our above decision in Criminal Appeals arising from\n\n        Special Leave Petition (Crl.) Nos.94-95 of 2019, no separate orders are\n\n        called for in the transfer petition.

I have had the advantage of going through an\n\nelaborate,   well   considered   and   scholarly   draft\n\njudgment proposed by my esteemed brother Justice\n\nUday Umesh Lalit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_125\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                                                           1</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_126\">\f2.   I entirely agree with the reasoning and the\n\nconclusion, which my erudite brother has drawn,\n\nwhich are based on remarkably articulate process of\n\nreasoning. However, having regard to the nature of\n\nthe controversy, I wish to add a few words of mine.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">3.   One    of   the   questions   which    fell   for\n\nconsideration in these appeals and was ably argued\n\nat length by the learned senior counsel for both the\n\nparties was in relation to the scope, extent and the\n\npurpose of <a href=\"/doc/23112748/\" id=\"a_183\">Section 212</a> of the Companies Act, 2013\n\n(hereinafter referred to as the “Act”) and, in\n\nparticular, whether the compliance of sub-section\n\n(3) of <a href=\"/doc/23112748/\" id=\"a_184\">Section 212</a> of the Act is mandatory or\n\ndirectory and, if so, why.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">4.   As rightly reasoned out by my learned brother\n\nLalit, J., having regard to the scheme of the Act\n\nunderlined in Chapter XIV (<a href=\"/doc/193909790/\" id=\"a_185\">Sections 206</a> to <a href=\"/doc/63355187/\" id=\"a_186\">229</a> of\n\nthe Act) dealing with the matters relating to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">                                                         2</span>\n\finspection,   inquiry    and    investigation   of   the\n\ncompanies in juxtaposition with Chapter XXIX\n\nwhich prescribes the punishment/penalties for\n\ncommission of various offences specified under the\n\nAct, the compliance of sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/23112748/\" id=\"a_187\">Section 212</a>\n\nof the Act is essentially directory.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_129\">5.   If the submission of the learned counsel for the\n\nrespondents (writ petitioners) that the compliance of\n\nsub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/23112748/\" id=\"a_188\">Section 212</a> of the Act in relation\n\nto the submission of the report be held mandatory\n\nis accepted (which I am afraid, I cannot accept) in\n\nour view, the very purpose of enacting <a href=\"/doc/23112748/\" id=\"a_189\">Section 212</a>\n\nof the Act would get defeated and will become\n\nnugatory.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_130\">6.   Indeed, when I apply the well-known principle\n\nof purposive interpretation while interpreting the\n\nrelevant provisions in juxtaposition and hold that\n\nsub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/23112748/\" id=\"a_190\">Section 212</a> of the Act is directory\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">                                                           3</span>\n\fin nature, it serves the legislative intent for which\n\nChapter XXIX is enacted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_131\">7.   I, therefore, agree with the reasoning and the\n\nconclusion arrived at by brother Justice Lalit on the\n\ninterpretation of sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/23112748/\" id=\"a_191\">Section 212</a> of\n\nthe Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_132\">8.   In the light of what is held above, the other\n\narguments of learned counsel for the respondents\n\ndo not survive for consideration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_133\">9.   So far as the other issues are concerned,\n\nbrother Lalit, J. has dealt with them succinctly. I\n\nentirely agree with him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_134\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_135\">                     ………...................................J.\n                     [ABHAY MANOHAR SAPRE]\n\nNew Delhi;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_136\">March 27, 2019.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_137\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">                                                                4</span>\n\f</p>","numcites":74,"numcitedby":77,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":114038066,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"transfer of investigation","formInput":"transfer%20of%20investigation"},{"value":"companies act 2013","formInput":"companies%20act%202013"},{"value":"sfio","formInput":"sfio"},{"value":"serious fraud investigation office","formInput":"serious%20fraud%20investigation%20office"},{"value":"illegal detention","formInput":"illegal%20detention"},{"value":"illegal arrest","formInput":"illegal%20arrest"},{"value":"habeas corpus","formInput":"habeas%20corpus"},{"value":"writ of habeas corpus","formInput":"writ%20of%20habeas%20corpus"},{"value":"transfer petition criminal","formInput":"transfer%20petition%20criminal"},{"value":"investigation into affairs of the company","formInput":"investigation%20into%20affairs%20of%20the%20company"},{"value":"remand with directions","formInput":"remand%20with%20directions"},{"value":"police remand ","formInput":"police%20remand%20"},{"value":"police custody ","formInput":"police%20custody%20"},{"value":"fraud by company","formInput":"fraud%20by%20company"},{"value":"transfer petition","formInput":"transfer%20petition"},{"value":"limited liability partnership","formInput":"limited%20liability%20partnership"},{"value":"nia act","formInput":"nia%20act"},{"value":"Criminal writ petition ","formInput":"Criminal%20writ%20petition%20"},{"value":"Mukesh modi","formInput":"Mukesh%20modi"},{"value":"darjeeling","formInput":"darjeeling"}],"cats":[{"value":"companies-law","formInput":"tag:companies-law"},{"value":"investigation-into-affairs-of-company","formInput":"tag:investigation-into-affairs-of-company"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
