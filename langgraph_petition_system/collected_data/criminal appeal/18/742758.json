Tala Sumo was signalled to spot. After\n\napplying brake driver tried to reiterate. But, with the help of\n\npolice officials, Tala sumo was stopped. Three persons were\n\nsitting by the side of driver. There were gunny bags in the\n\nTata sumo. One person was sitting on the gunny bag. On\n\nenquiry, driver of Tata Sumo had disclosed his name as\n\nHarnek Singh     and three other persons who were sitting\n\nalong with the driver      disclosed their names as    Rajdeep\n\nSingh, Karamjit Singh alias Kala and Surjit Singh. Person\n\nsitting on the bags disclosed his name as Balraj Singh.\n\nInvestigating   Officer    suspected   that   there   is   some\n\nincriminating article in the bag and the bags are to be\n\nsearched. Offer was given to the accused separately as to\n\nwhether   they want to be searched in the presence of           a\n\nGazetted Officer or Magistrate. Accused replied that       they\n\nwant to be searched       before any Gazetted Officer. Consent\n\nmemos were recorded separately. Accused had signed/thumb\n\nmarked the memos respectively in token of their correctness.\n\nOn telephone, DSP Gurjinder Singh, Jagraon was requested\n\nto reach the spot. At 7.30 A.M.

D.S.P. gave\n\noffer to the accused as to whether they want to be searched\n\nbefore any Magistrate or Gazetted Officer. Accused reposed\n\nfaith in the DSP and agreed to be searched. Consent memo\n\nwas prepared which was signed and thumb marked by the\n\naccused.

Next day, he along with\n\nsome respectables      had gone to the police station and then\n\ncame to know about the present case. No incriminating\n\narticle was recovered from Surjit Singh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">         After hearing learned Public Prosecutor for the State\n\nand defence counsel for the accused and also from the perusal\n\nof the evidence, learned Judge Special Court, Ludhiana\n\nopined that accused committed an offence punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1046310/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 15</a> of the Narcotic Drugs &amp; Psychotropic Substances\n\nAct, 1985 and were sentenced as aforesaid.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">         We have heard learned counsel for the appellants and\n\nMs. Manjuri Nehru Kaul, Deputy Advocate General, Punjab\n\nfor the respondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">         Learned counsel for the appellants-accused argued\n\nthat as per story, recovery was affected on 5.2.2002. There is\n\ndelay   in depositing the    samples in the office of Chemical\n\nExaminer. Delay was not explained. Possibility of tampering\n\nwith the case property cannot be ruled out.    No explanation\n\nwhy available witnesses were not joined. According to the\n\nstory, three persons were sitting by the side of driver. One\n\nwas seen while sitting on the gunny bags. In fact, Harnek\n\nSingh was not the driver. Evidence is not clear as to who was\n\nin conscious possession of the gunny bags.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">          Learned Public Prosecutor for the State argued\n\nthat appellants-accused are from different villages. Owner of\n\nthe vehicle had failed to appear and explain as to who was the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\"> Crl. Appeal No. 1059-DB of 2007.        9</span>\nCrl.Appeal No. 2483-SB of 2007\n\n\ndriver of the vehicle or that the vehicle was not being driven\n\nby Harnek Singh. No allegation of the other accused      that\n\nthey had taken lift in the Tata sumo.   Statements of Wazir\n\nSingh and Kashmir Singh are of no evidentiary value because\n\nno complaint was made to any authority that case is false.\n\nBefore the present occurrence, police officials had no enmity\n\nwith the appellants-accused. So, there was no idea to\n\nimplicate the appellants-accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">           Submission of the learned defence counsel is that\n\nthere is delay in depositing the samples in the office of\n\nChemical Examiner. Delay is fatal. Possibility of tampering\n\nwith the case property cannot be ruled out but we are not in a\n\nposition to agree with this submission of the learned defence\n\ncounsel.   Evidence on the file shows that police party was\n\nholding a naka bandi near the bridge of canal minor falling in\n\nthe revenue estate of village Sidhwan Kalan. At 11.40 A.M.\n\nTata sumo was      sighted while coming from the side of\n\nSidhwan Kalan . Tweleve bags of poppy husk were recovered\n\nfrom the Tata sumo. Two samples each weighing 250 grams\n\nwere separated from each bag. Balraj Singh was also\n\ninterrogated and on interrogation, he had suffered disclosure\n\nstatement that he has kept concealed eight bags of poppy\n\nhusk. As per statement, eight bags of poppy husk were\n\nrecovered. Two samples each weighing 250 grams were\n\nseparated. Samples and the remaining poppy husk in bags\n\nwas sealed with the seal bearing impressions &quot;PJ&quot; and &quot;BS&quot;.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> Crl. Appeal No. 1059-DB of 2007.               10</span>\nCrl.Appeal No. 2483-SB of 2007\n\n\nAfter recovery, the case property was deposited with MHC\n\nJagraj Singh who had tendered his affidavit Ex.PB. In cross\n\nexamination, MHC Jagraj Singh, stated that case property\n\nwas deposited with him on 5.9.2002 at 5.30 P.M.                       No\n\nsuggestion to the witness as to why samples were not sent to\n\nthe office of Chemical Examiner          immediately.        Constable\n\nAvtar Singh         had deposited      samples in       the office of\n\nChemical Examiner. Constable Avtar Singh when appeared\n\nas PW1 was not cross examined by the defence counsel. On\n\n6.9.2002 case property was produced before the SDJM,\n\nJagraon.      Case property was     checked by the Magistrate.\n\nCase property was found          sealed with the seals bearing\n\nimpression     PJ    and   GS.   One    seal    used    was    of     the\n\nInvestigating Officer and the second           seal was of the DSP.\n\nOffice   of   the    DSP   was   separate      from    the   office    of\n\nInvestigating Officer. There is no provision that after\n\nrecovery of the contraband, samples are to be deposited in the\n\nlaboratory on the same day. No prejudice was caused to the\n\nappellants-accused by not depositing the sample on the next\n\nday in the office of Chemical Examiner. Seal impression was\n\nalso prepared at the spot. When the case property was sealed\n\nwith the seal bearing impressions &quot;PJ&quot; and &quot;BS&quot; then it was\n\nvery difficult for the Investigating Officer to tamper with the\n\ncase property because D.S.P. had retained his seal with him\n\nafter using the same to seal the case property. Instructions\n\nto deposit sample within 72 hours are only directory and not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> Crl. Appeal No. 1059-DB of 2007.          11</span>\nCrl.Appeal No. 2483-SB of 2007\n\n\nmandatory. Learned defence counsel failed to cite any\n\nprovision of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_5\">Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances\n\nAct</a> that after recovery of poppy husk, sample is to be\n\ndeposited immediately on the same day or next day in the\n\noffice of Chemical Examiner. Question is whether case\n\nproperty was tampered with or not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">           Next submission of the defence counsel was that\n\nindependent witnesses were available but no one was joined\n\nintentionally. Statement of the police officials without any\n\nindependent    corroboration   inspires   no   confidence   but\n\nsubmission of the defence counsel seems to be not correct\n\none. There was no secret information with the police party.\n\nPolice party was holding a naka bandi near the bridge        of\n\ncanal minor falling in the revenue estate of village Sidhwan\n\nKalan when sighted the vehicle. No independent witness was\n\navailable. In case, independent witness was available but not\n\njoined by the Investigating Officer    then story is not to be\n\nignored.   Question is why the police officials    have deposed\n\nagainst the appellants-accused particularly when appellants-\n\naccused had no enmity with the police officials. In case,\n\nindependent witness present is not joined then evidence on\n\nthe file is to be scrutinized with great care and caution. Mere\n\nnon-joining of independent witness is not fatal.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">              Next submission of the learned defence counsel\n\nwas that by the side of driver three accused were sitting. One\n\naccused was sitting on the gunny bag. Harnek Singh was not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\"> Crl. Appeal No. 1059-DB of 2007.          12</span>\nCrl.Appeal No. 2483-SB of 2007\n\n\nthe driver. No cogent and convincing evidence on the file as to\n\nwhich   accused    was   in   conscious   possession    of   the\n\nincriminating article but submission of the learned defence\n\ncounsel seems to be not genuine one because as per RC on the\n\nfile Tata sumo was in the name of Abdul Wahid son of Mohd.\n\nRamzan, partner of M/S. Plantsman Landscapes and Seeds,\n\nRajbaha Road, Patiala. Appellants-accused are from different\n\nvillages. They were to explain how they were travelling in\n\nTata sumo bearing registration No. PB-11H0786, Owner of\n\nthe Tata sumo was not produced to state that Harnek Singh\n\nwas not the driver. Recovery was from the area of Sindhwan\n\nKalan. Question is how the appellants from different villages\n\nwere together in a Tata sumo in the area of Sindhwan Kalan\n\nwith incriminating article. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"489126\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/489126/\" id=\"a_6\">Madan Lal and another Vs.\n\nState of Himachal Pradesh</a> 2003 (45) RCR (Criminal) 100.\n\nHon&#x27;ble Supreme Court held that recovery of contraband on\n\nsearch of car- five persons travelling in the car- one of them\n\nstated that contraband belonged to him. Held, statement was\n\ntotally out of contest and no credence can at all be attached to\n\nthe statement because in the statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 313</a>\n\nCr.P.C., he did not state that he alone was in possession- all\n\nthe accused held responsible for possession. In the present\n\ncase, no plea of the appellants-accused that they were not in\n\nconscious possession of the contraband. Tweleve bags of\n\npoppy husk were recovered from Tata sumo. Eight bags of\n\npoppy husk were recovered        as per disclosure statement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\"> Crl.

In the absence of defence plea by\n\nany of the accused that he was not in conscious possession\n\nparticularly when no defence of the appellants-accused that\n\nthey were travelling in the Tata sumo by taking lift shows\n\nthat all the appellants-accused were in conscious possession\n\nof the contraband. Appellant-accused had special knowledge\n\nabout the contraband being carried in the Tata sumo. Eight\n\nbags of     poppy husk were     recovered as       per disclosure\n\nstatement. So,     counsel for the appellants-accused cannot\n\nargue that the appellants-accused       were not in conscious\n\npossession of the contraband.</span>      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1807654\" id=\"span_13\">In <a href=\"/doc/1807654/\" id=\"a_8\">Megh Singh Vs.
