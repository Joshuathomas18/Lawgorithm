The seminal question involved in these appeals is: whether\n\nthe Chief Judicial Magistrate (for short, “CJM”) is competent to\n\nprocess the request of the secured creditor to take possession of\n\nthe secured asset under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 14</a> of the Securitisation and\n\nReconstruction of Financial Assets and Enforcement of Security\n\nInterest Act, 2002 (for short, “2002 Act”)? There are conflicting\n\nviews of different High Courts on this question. The High Courts\n\nof Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand\n\nhave interpreted the said provision to mean that only the Chief\n\nMetropolitan Magistrate (for short, “CMM”) in metropolitan areas\n\nand the District Magistrate (for short, “DM”) in non­metropolitan\n\nareas are competent to deal with such request. On the other\n\nhand, the High Courts of Kerala, Karnataka, Allahabad and\n\nAndhra Pradesh have taken a contrary view of the same\n\nprovision, to mean that it does not debar or preclude the CJM in\n\nthe non­metropolitan areas to exercise power under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 14</a> of\n\nthe 2002 Act.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                  4</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">3.   The earliest decision is of the Division Bench of the High\n\nCourt of Kerala at Ernakulam in Muhammed Ashraf and Anr.\n\nVs. Union of India (UOI) and Others1. The Court noted that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act expressly refers to CMM in relation to\n\nmetropolitan areas and DM for non­metropolitan areas. It then\n\nwent on to observe that as the powers and functions of CJM in\n\nnon­metropolitan areas and CMM in metropolitan areas are one\n\nand the same (with only difference that CMM exercises powers in\n\nmetropolitan areas and CJM in non­metropolitan areas); and the\n\nexpression CJM and CMM are interchangeably used namely, one\n\nis synonymous for the other depending on the area under its\n\njurisdiction, by interpretative process, it concluded that in non­\n\nmetropolitan areas, apart from DM, the CJM is also competent to\n\nexercise powers under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act. This decision\n\nwas carried in appeal before this Court being SLP (C) No.1671 of\n\n2009 which, however, came to be dismissed on 2 nd February,\n\n2009 as no ground to interfere with the impugned judgment was\n\nmade out.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">1.

Soon thereafter, another Division Bench of the High of\n\nKerala in <a href=\"/doc/996437/\" id=\"a_5\">Radhakrishnan, V.N. Vs. State of Kerala and Anr.</a> 2,\n\nreiterated the view taken in Muhammed Ashraf (supra) and\n\ndeclined to refer the matter to a full bench for reconsideration.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">5.   However, around the same time, the High Court of Bombay\n\n(Aurangabad Bench) in IndusInd Bank Ltd., (formerly known\n\nas Ashok Leyland Finance Ltd.) through its Legal Executive,\n\nRavindrakumar       Prakash     Bhargodev     Vs.   The   State   of\n\nMaharashtra      through      Police    Station3,   had   taken    a\n\ndiametrically opposite view. It had held that it is not open to\n\nsubstitute the word, “CMM” for “CJM”. For, there is no indication\n\nin the 2002 Act that the legislature had intended to empower the\n\nCJM outside the metropolitan areas, although the judicial officer\n\n(CMM) was entrusted with the power to deal with such request in\n\nthe metropolitan areas. Again in Arjun Urban Co­operative\n\nBank Ltd., Solapur Vs. Chief Judicial Magistrate, Solapur\n\nand Ors.4, another Division Bench of the High Court of Bombay\n\nopined that Section 14 of the 2002 Act, in no univocal terms,\n\n2 MANU/KE/0677/2008 (Cr. M.C.

However, in 2013, the High Court of Karnataka in Kaveri\n\nMarketing Vs. The Saraswathi Co­op.

The borrowers or the persons claiming through borrowers,\n\nwould contend that literal interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 14</a> of the\n\n2002 Act must be preferred. In which case, the secured creditor\n\ncan seek assistance “only” of CMM in metropolitan areas and DM\n\n9 AIR (2017) M.P. 36\n10 MANU/UC/0012/2012\n11 (2013) 4 CHN 95\n12 AIR (2016) A.P. 125 (FB)\n13 AIR (2016) All. 210\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                   8</span>\n\n\n\n\nin non­metropolitan areas, for the purpose of taking over\n\npossession of the secured asset or property (instead of resorting\n\nto recovery of property by other means). As the provision is\n\nunivocal, it cannot be interpreted in any other manner. To do so\n\nwould entail in doing violence to the legislative intent. There is\n\npresumption that Parliament had complete knowledge of the\n\nexisting laws and was conscious of the distinction or similarity\n\nbetween the scope of powers to be exercised by the CMM, DM\n\nand CJM, as the case may be, in terms of the provision of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_16\">Cr.P.C</a>.\n\nand other laws. Despite such awareness, the parliament\n\nconsciously chose to identify clearly, the authority which can\n\nentertain the application(s) of the secured creditor under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_17\">Section\n\n14</a> of the 2002 Act. In that sense, the provision is in the nature of\n\ndefining the authority persona designata, namely CMM and DM\n\nfor the concerned area.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">9.   If so, contends the learned counsel, it is not open for the\n\nCourt to take recourse of interpretative process to include\n\nanother authority such as CJM merely because the functions\n\ndischarged by the CJM and CMM under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_18\">Cr.P.C</a>. and other\n\nlaws are similar. There is no room for invoking the doctrine of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                   9</span>\n\n\n\n\nCasus Omissus in light of the unambiguous provision in the form\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act. Thus, the similarity of functions\n\ndischarged by the CMM and CJM under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_20\">Cr.P.C</a>. would be of\n\nno avail. Rather, the Court must follow the maxim “cum inverbis\n\nnulla ambiguitas est, non debet admitti voluntatis quaestio” and\n\nprefer the plain language of the statute. To demonstrate the\n\ndistinction between the hierarchy of the judicial officers, reliance\n\nhas been placed on a chart which clearly distinguishes them on\n\nthe basis of their functions as non­Judicial Magistrate and\n\nJudicial Magistrate in the concerned area. The office of DM\n\nessentially discharges executive functions and comes within the\n\nnon­Judicial Magistrate category. On the other hand, the office of\n\nCMM or CJM would involve both executive and judicial functions.\n\nThis distinction is crucial and it must be presumed that the\n\nParliament was conscious about this distinction. It is also urged\n\nthat the Parliament in various Acts, including the <a href=\"/doc/438563/\" id=\"a_21\">Sick Industrial\n\nCompanies (Special Provision) Act, 1985</a> – <a href=\"/doc/34973/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 29</a>, Banking\n\nRegulation Act, 1949 – Section 45S, Industrial Reconstruction\n\nBank of India, 1984 – <a href=\"/doc/149163027/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 51</a>, National Housing Bank Act,\n\n1987 – <a href=\"/doc/143985297/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 36</a>­<a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_25\">H, Companies Act, 1956</a> – <a href=\"/doc/172276913/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 10FP</a>,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                   <a href=\"/doc/189352450/\" id=\"a_27\">10</a></span>\n\n\n\n\nCompanies Act, 2013 – <a href=\"/doc/109418126/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 429</a> and <a href=\"/doc/123080598/\" id=\"a_29\">Small Industries\n\nDevelopment Bank of India Act, 1989</a> ­ <a href=\"/doc/197363740/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 39</a>, have enacted\n\nsimilar provisions empowering CMM/DM, for seeking assistance\n\nto take possession of the property sold or leased.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">10.

Per contra, the secured creditors (Banks) and auction\n\npurchasers would commend us with the view taken by the High\n\nCourts of Kerala, Andhra Pradesh, Allahabad and Karnataka.\n\nAccording to them, the process under <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act\n\n\n18   AIR (2003) SC 2103\n19   (2004) 11 SCC 625\n20   (2006) 5 SCC 745\n21   (2013) 9 SCC 620\n22   (2014) 6 SCC 1\n23   (2016) 3 SCC 643\n24   (2018) 3 SCC 85\n25   (2018) 9 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">\f                                     12</span>\n\n\n\n\ncan be invoked by the secured creditor only for taking possession\n\nof the secured assets. The application is required to be filed by\n\nthe secured creditor supported by an affidavit stating due\n\ncompliances of the stipulations provided therefor. The inquiry\n\nenvisaged under <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act, to be undertaken by\n\nthe CMM or DM, is minimal and basic in nature. It is only to\n\nsatisfy itself about the factual position stated by the secured\n\ncreditor in the concerned application including the appended\n\naffidavit filed therewith. It is not an adjudicatory process\n\nmuchless to decide about the rights and liabilities of the\n\ncontesting parties. The nature of inquiry is essentially one of\n\nexercise of administrative or executive powers. Sub­Section (1A)\n\nenables the DM or CMM to authorise any officer subordinate to\n\nhim to take possession.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">13. The CMM and CJM are clothed with powers as per the\n\nscheme   of    <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_44\">Cr.P.C</a>..   The    office   of   CMM   and   CJM    are\n\ninterchangeable and they discharge similar functions in their\n\nrespective    jurisdictions     namely,    metropolitan    and   non­\n\nmetropolitan areas, as the case may be. The recent enunciation\n\nof this Court expounds that the inquiry requires judicious\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                    13</span>\n\n\n\n\napproach. Therefore, it could be effectively exercised by CJM in a\n\nnon­metropolitan area. There is no express provision in the 2002\n\nAct, so as to disregard the dispensation under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_45\">Cr.P.C</a>.,\n\nconcerning the exercise of powers by the CMM and CJM\n\nrespectively. On the other hand, <a href=\"/doc/84614681/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 37</a> of the 2002 Act\n\nmakes it amply clear that the application of provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_47\">Cr.P.C</a>.\n\nis not completely ruled out. <a href=\"/doc/84614681/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 37</a> of the 2002 Act postulates\n\nthat the application of other laws in force would continue to\n\napply and the provisions of 2002 Act or the Rules made\n\nthereunder shall be in addition thereto and not in derogation\n\nthereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">14. It is urged that the 2002 Act does not define the term\n\n“CMM” or “DM”.

The\n\nadjudicatory process like sifting of evidence, trial etc. is required\n\nto be undertaken only by a Judicial Magistrate. The Executive\n\nMagistrate can exercise only executive powers. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1977799\" id=\"span_26\">Indisputably, the\n\npowers     of   CJM   in   non­metropolitan   area   and   CMM     in\n\nmetropolitan area are equal and those terms are used as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                  14</span>\n\n\n\n\nsynonymous.

Union of India and\n\nOthers26</a>, it is urged that incontrovertibly the post of CJM and\n\nCMM must be equated and they have to be placed in the same\n\ncadre of Civil Judge (Senior Division).</span> Reliance is also placed on\n\nStandard Chartered Bank (supra), to contend that there is no\n\ndifference in the jurisdiction or powers exercisable by the CJM\n\nand CMM, except operating in different territorial area. It is thus\n\nurged that expressions “CMM/DM” in <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 14</a> be construed as\n\nalso including “CJM” in a non­metropolitan area.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"84627277\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1988649\" id=\"span_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"168450156\" id=\"span_30\">15.

A\n\npurposive interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 14</a> as including the office of\n\nCJM in a non­metropolitan area would further the legislative\n\nintent as it would enable the secured creditor to approach the\n\nCJM to take possession of the secured assets thereat.</span></span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">16.

In that, it is merely verification of\n\ncompliances by the secured creditor. In any case, the aggrieved\n\nborrower has a statutory remedy of appeal against the order\n\npassed by the CJM as would be available against the order\n\npassed by CMM/DM. Similarly, all contentious issues available to\n\nthe borrowers or the persons claiming through them could be\n\n27 (2010) 8 SCC 49\n28 (2005) 6 SCC 705\n29 (2013) 5 SCC 762\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                    16</span>\n\n\n\n\nraised by them even before the CJM, who would be equally\n\ncompetent to deal with the same as would be done by the\n\nCMM/DM, as per law. Considering the fact that the CMM and\n\nCJM both discharge similar functions and are treated equivalent\n\nfor all purposes in the respective territorial jurisdictions, it is not\n\na case of application being processed by someone who is inferior\n\nand not competent or qualified to do so.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"614998\" id=\"span_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1239058\" id=\"span_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"399708\" id=\"span_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"132692083\" id=\"span_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"458532\" id=\"span_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1887677\" id=\"span_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"176039345\" id=\"span_39\">17.

The said\n\nauthority is empowered to take such steps and use such force, as\n\nmay be necessary for taking possession of the secured assets and\n\ndocuments relating thereto. Strikingly, the act of the authority is\n\nprotected and its action cannot be questioned in any Court or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">\f                                    22</span>\n\n\n\n\nbefore any authority in terms of <a href=\"/doc/48303029/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 34</a> of the 2002 Act. It\n\nalso noted that a trial or adjudication of dispute by the authority\n\nis not contemplated under this Section. However, the limited\n\ninquiry to be undertaken is whether secured property is\n\nidentifiable and whether 60 days’ notice was issued under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/194074141/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 13(2)</a> enabling the secured creditor to resort to <a href=\"/doc/91670591/\" id=\"a_91\">Section\n\n13(4)</a> and take possession of the secured assets. The Court\n\nunerringly opined that <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act is only for the\n\npurpose of executing the power and assisting the secured creditor\n\nto take possession of the secured assets. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1059476\" id=\"span_49\">The borrower or person\n\naffected by such action has a right of judicial review before the\n\nWrit Court as ordained by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1059476/\" id=\"a_93\">Mardia Chemicals Ltd.\n\nand Others v. Union of India and Others37</a>. The Division Bench\n\nthen noted that the 2002 Act is a self­contained code, including\n\nthe powers of the Tribunal to declare any of the measures taken\n\nby the secured creditor invalid and consequential restoration of\n\npossession to persons from whom the possession was taken. The\n\nCourt reiterated that in absence of any adjudicatory power vested\n\nin the authority referred to in <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act, it had\n\n\n37 (2004) 4 SCC 311   (paragraph Nos.80 and 81)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">\f                                    23</span>\n\n\n\n\nno powers to exercise the powers vested in the Tribunal.\n\nWhereas, it can only facilitate the secured creditor in taking\n\npossession of the secured assets after verification of the basic\n\nfacts regarding the entitlement of the secured creditor to get such\n\npossession.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1511187\" id=\"span_51\">The Court then adverted to the exposition of this\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1511187/\" id=\"a_95\">Transcore Vs. Union of India and Another38</a>, which\n\nhad analysed the provisions of the 2002 Act.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"593057\" id=\"span_52\">It then adverted to\n\nthe Gujarat High Court decision in <a href=\"/doc/593057/\" id=\"a_96\">Bank of India Vs. Pankaj\n\nDilipbhai Hemnani and Others39</a> and agreed with the dictum\n\ntherein that the authority referred to under <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 14</a> of the\n\n2002 Act can only verify whether 60 days’ notice as prescribed\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/194074141/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 13(2)</a> was issued or not and whether secured asset\n\nis identifiable. It then noted that after such inquiry the authority\n\nbefore taking action is obliged to satisfy itself in that regard. At\n\nthe same time, it cannot enter upon adjudication or trial of a\n\ndispute while exercising power under <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act.\n\nThe Parliament has invested power under <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 14</a> of the 2002\n\nAct, in a senior functionary so as to avoid an arbitrary and high­\n\nhanded action at the instance of secured creditor.

The Court\n\nthen noticed the definition of metropolitan area in <a href=\"/doc/1604548/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 2(k)</a> of\n\nCr.P.C., <a href=\"/doc/37313769/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 3</a> regarding construction of references which\n\nequates the CJM to that of the CMM whilst exercising jurisdiction\n\nin the concerned areas. Considering the legislative scheme in that\n\nregard, the Court concluded that the powers of the CJM in non­\n\nmetropolitan areas and CMM in metropolitan areas, are one and\n\nthe same with only difference being that the CMM exercises\n\npowers in metropolitan areas.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1155660\" id=\"span_55\">The Court then analysed the\n\ndecision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1155660/\" id=\"a_105\">Unique Butyle Tube Industries Pvt.\n\nLtd.</a> (supra) and distinguished the same by holding that in the\n\npresent case, the question was whether the term CMM in\n\nmetropolitan areas will include CJM in non­metropolitan areas.\n\nThe Court went on to observe that the legislation must be\n\nunderstood in a reasonable manner.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"458532\" id=\"span_56\">For that, it took support\n\n40 I.L.R. 2006 Ker 645\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">\f                                            25</span>\n\n\n\n\nfrom the dictum in Holmes Vs.

State (Delhi Admn</a>.)50 to hold that\n\nif the statutory provision is open to more than one interpretation,\n\nthen the Court must adopt the one which represents the true\n\nintent of the legislature. However, the function of the Court is\n\nonly to expound and not to legislate. At the same time, the\n\nprocess of construction combines both literal and purposive\n\napproaches. Finally, the Court went on to observe that in the\n\npresent case there was no casus omissus. In that, CJM in\n\nmetropolitan areas are designated as CMM and vice versa\n\nmutatis­mutandis by implication and reference by the areas of\n\njurisdiction both stand on the same footing to denote the\n\nauthority depending upon where he is situated.

The full Bench of the High Court of Judicature at\n\nHyderabad for the State of Telangana and the State of Andhra\n\nPradesh in M/s T.R. Jewellery (supra) also analysed the\n\nprovisions of the 2002 Act and noted that the object of the Act is\n\nto achieve speedier recovery of the dues declared as Non­\n\nPerforming Assets (NPAs), without the intervention of the\n\nTribunals or the Courts and for quick resolution of disputes\n\narising out of the action taken for recovery of such dues apart\n\nfrom making better availability of capital liquidity and resources\n\nto help in the growth of economy and welfare of the people. As\n\nregards to <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 14</a> of the Act, it noted that the purpose\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">\f                                  28</span>\n\n\n\n\nunderlying is to assist the secured creditor for taking possession\n\nor control of the secured assets by requesting the authority\n\nreferred to therein. The Court then went on to analyse the\n\nscheme of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_115\">Cr.P.C</a>. and noted that the executive powers are to\n\nbe exercised by the Executive Magistrate, whereas sifting of\n\nevidence shall be exercisable only by a Judicial Magistrate.\n\nFurther, from the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_116\">Cr.P.C</a>., it is clear that the CJM,\n\nCMM and the DM are separately referred to in the Code and High\n\nCourt has been empowered to appoint CJM and CMM while the\n\nState Government appoints one of the Executive Magistrate as\n\nDM in every District. The Court then adverted to the decisions of\n\ndifferent High Courts which have had the occasion to deal with\n\nthe question under consideration in reference to <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 14</a> of the\n\n2002 Act, as to whether the CJM in non­metropolitan areas, is\n\nequally competent to entertain or deal with the application moved\n\nby the secured creditor. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"191143417\" id=\"span_68\">It then adverted to <a href=\"/doc/4715275/\" id=\"a_118\">Sections 35</a> and <a href=\"/doc/84614681/\" id=\"a_119\">37</a> of\n\nthe 2002 Act and noted the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/191143417/\" id=\"a_120\">Mathew\n\nVarghese Vs. M. Amritha Kumar and Others51</a> to conclude that\n\nthe application of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_121\">Cr.P.C</a>., would be in\n\n\n51 (2014) 5 SCC 610\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">\f                                    29</span>\n\n\n\n\naddition to and not in derogation of the provisions of 2002 Act\n\nand the provisions of the Code cannot be excluded from\n\nconsideration while dealing with the 2002 Act. It disagreed with\n\nthe Full Bench of the Madras High Court that <a href=\"/doc/4715275/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 35</a> of the\n\n2002 Act would override the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_123\">Cr.P.C</a>.. After analysing\n\nthe other decisions, it went on to hold that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 14</a>\n\nof the 2002 Act, the CJM can authorise any officer subordinate to\n\nhim to take possession of such assets after examining the\n\ncorrectness of the assertion made in the affidavit. Thus, it is only\n\na procedural step without any adjudication of any dispute\n\nwhatsoever. The action is therefore, only an administrative order\n\nmade for taking possession of the secured assets, if all other\n\nconditions are fulfilled. Having already noted that the powers\n\nexercised by the CMM and DM in terms of <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 14</a> of the 2002\n\nAct are synonymous to each other and that they are not\n\nadjudicatory   in   nature,   it   answered   the   question   under\n\nconsideration in the affirmative. The Court then noted that there\n\nwas no casus omissus nor it was reading something into the\n\nprovision which the legislature never intended nor trying to\n\ninterpret the provision so as to defeat the intention of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">\f                                       30</span>\n\n\n\n\nlegislature. Whereas, the Court was only resorting to a purposive\n\ninterpretation to effectuate the intention of the legislature for\n\nwhich the enactment was made. Thus, it concluded that exercise\n\nof power by the CJM in non­metropolitan areas, who exercises\n\nthe same powers as that of CMM in metropolitan areas, would\n\nnot in any way abrogate or contradict the dispensation predicated\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act. Moreso, it would not cause even a\n\ntittle of prejudice to any of the parties. Whereas, it would ensure\n\na just process under the aegis of a judicial mind (CJM) in\n\nrendering   assistance    to   the    secured     creditors    to   recover\n\npossession of their assets thereby achieving the object for which\n\nthe 2002 Act has been enacted.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">23. Similarly, the Karnataka High Court at Bangalore in Kaveri\n\nMarketing    (supra),    opined      that   the   expression    CMM     be\n\nconstrued as inclusive of CJM for non­metropolitan areas, as the\n\npowers of CJM and CMM are identical. Thus, the High Court of\n\nKarnataka also opined that the CJM in non­metropolitan areas\n\nwould be competent to entertain and deal with application under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">\f                                      31</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"34373683\" id=\"span_72\">24. Similar view has been taken by the Division Bench of the\n\nHigh Court of Allahabad in <a href=\"/doc/34373683/\" id=\"a_128\">Abhishek Mishra</a> (supra). It is held\n\nthat <a href=\"/doc/126561274/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act is a procedural measure enabling\n\nthe secured creditor to take possession of the secured assets by\n\nmaking application to the authority specified therein. Even the\n\nAllahabad High Court adverted to the scheme of the provisions in\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_130\">Cr.P.C</a>. bestowing executive and judicial power in the\n\nconcerned authority.</span> Besides, it made reference to the same\n\ndecisions as noticed by the High Court of Kerala in Muhammed\n\nAshraf (supra) and concluded as under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">          “34.

It noted that the\n\nreference to expression CJM is conspicuously absent in <a href=\"/doc/1638914/\" id=\"a_158\">Section\n\n14</a> of the 2002 Act and, therefore, the legislature did not intend\n\nto entrust the stated function to CJM in a non­metropolitan area,\n\nalthough the same is entrusted to CMM, a judicial officer, in\n\nmetropolitan area.</span>       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1300023\" id=\"span_80\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1300023\" id=\"span_81\">Yet again, in Arjun Urban Co­operative\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1300023/\" id=\"a_159\">Bank Ltd.</a> (supra), another Division Bench of the High Court of\n\nBombay reiterated the exposition in <a href=\"/doc/1300023/\" id=\"a_160\">IndusInd Bank Ltd.</a> (supra)\n\nafter adverting to the dictum in Trade Well and Another Vs.\n\nIndian Bank and Another52, Transcore (supra) and Unique\n\n52 (2007) Cri.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1155660\" id=\"span_82\"><a href=\"/doc/1155660/\" id=\"a_161\">LJ 2544\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">\f                                    35</span>\n\n\n\n\nButyle Tube Industries Pvt.

It then went on to advert to the dictum of Lord Denning in\n\nSeaford Court Estates Ltd. (supra) and House of Lords in Inco\n\nEurope Ltd.

Vs\n           Sunburst Oil &amp; Refining Co. 287 U.S. 358 (1932) The\n           said doctrine was for the first time applied in Golak\n           Nath Vs State of Punjab MANU/SC/0029/1967 : AIR\n           1967 SC 1643 in India and thereafter referred and\n           relied on in various decisions, and as such, the\n           doctrine of prospective overruling is now an integral\n           part of the Indian Legal System. It is well settled that\n           the overruling decision is a new decision, because it\n           has overruled the settled precedent and it has decided\n           an issue of first impression, where at least one earlier\n           case has not foreshadowed the overruling decision.

The Single Judge of the Madras High Court in Shyam\n\nSunder Rohra (supra), adopted the view taken by the Full Bench\n\nof High Court of Madras in K.

Going by the literal interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_231\">Section 14</a> of the 2002\n\nAct, it does appear that CMM or the DM within whose\n\njurisdiction the secured asset is situated in, is bestowed with the\n\nauthority to entertain the request of the secured creditor for\n\npossession of such secured asset. It also appears that remedy is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">\f                                    45</span>\n\n\n\n\nprovided before the designated authority, persona designata. That\n\nis the view taken by the High Courts of Bombay, Calcutta,\n\nMadras, Madhya Pradesh and Uttarakhand. At the same time,\n\nthe High Courts of Kerala, Karnataka, Allahabad and Andhra\n\nPradesh have taken a liberal approach and were persuaded to\n\ninvoke purposive interpretation and give expansive meaning to\n\nthe expression “CMM”, to include CJM for the non­metropolitan\n\nareas. That has been done in the context of the nature of inquiry\n\nrequired to be conducted by the concerned authority.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">32. Indisputably, the expressions “CMM” and “DM” have not\n\nbeen defined in the 2002 Act. That definition can thus, be traced\n\nto the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_232\">Cr.P.C</a>.. It is also well established by now that\n\nthe 2002 Act, is a self­contained code. Concededly, the nature of\n\ninquiry to be conducted by the designated authorities under the\n\n2002 Act, is spelt out in <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_233\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act. The same is\n\ncircumscribed and is limited to matters specified in Clauses (i) to\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">(ix) of the first proviso in sub­section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_234\">Section 14</a> of the 2002\n\nAct, inserted in 2013. Prior to the insertion of that proviso, it was\n\nalways understood that in such inquiry, it is not open to\n\nadjudicate upon contentious pleas regarding the rights of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">\f                                    46</span>\n\n\n\n\nparties in any manner. The stated authorities could only do\n\nverification of the genuineness of the plea and upon being\n\nsatisfied that it is genuine, the adjudication thereof could then be\n\nleft to the Court of competent jurisdiction.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">33. Suffice to observe that an inquiry conducted by the stated\n\nauthority under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_235\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act, is a sui generis\n\ninquiry. In that, majorly it is an administrative or executive\n\nfunction regarding verification of the affidavit and the relied upon\n\ndocuments filed by the parties. That inquiry is required to be\n\nconcluded within the stipulated time frame. While undertaking\n\nsuch an inquiry, as is observed by this Court, the authority must\n\ndisplay judicious approach, in considering the relevant factual\n\nposition asserted by the parties. That pre­supposes that it is a\n\nquasi­judicial inquiry though, a non­judicial process. The inquiry\n\ndoes not result in adjudication of inter se rights of the parties in\n\nrespect of the subject property or of the fact that the transaction\n\nis a fraudulent one or otherwise.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">34. Notably, the powers and functions of the CMM and the CJM\n\nare equivalent and similar, in relation to matters specified in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">\f                                  47</span>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_236\">Cr.P.C</a>.. These expressions (CMM and CJM) are interchangeable\n\nand synonymous to each other. Moreover, <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_237\">Section 14</a> of the 2002\n\nAct does not explicitly exclude the CJM from dealing with the\n\nrequest of the secured creditor made thereunder. The power to be\n\nexercised under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_238\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act by the concerned\n\nauthority is, by its very nature, non­judicial or State’s coercive\n\npower. Furthermore, the borrower or the persons claiming\n\nthrough borrower or for that matter likely to be affected by the\n\nproposed action being in possession of the subject property, have\n\nstatutory remedy under <a href=\"/doc/112742697/\" id=\"a_239\">Section 17</a> of the 2002 Act and/or\n\njudicial review under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_240\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. In\n\nthat sense, no prejudice is likely       to be caused to the\n\nborrower/lessee; nor is it possible to suggest that they are\n\nrendered remediless in law. At the same time, the secured\n\ncreditor who invokes the process under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_241\">Section 14</a> of the 2002\n\nAct does not get any advantage muchless added advantage.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">Taking totality of all these aspects, there is nothing wrong in\n\ngiving expansive meaning to the expression “CMM”, as inclusive\n\nof CJM concerning non­metropolitan area, who is otherwise\n\ncompetent to discharge administrative as well as judicial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">\f                                   48</span>\n\n\n\n\nfunctions as delineated in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_242\">Cr.P.C</a>. on the same terms as\n\nCMM. That interpretation would make the provision more\n\nmeaningful. Such interpretation does not militate against the\n\nlegislative intent nor it would be a case of allowing an unworthy\n\nperson or authority to undertake inquiry which is limited to\n\nmatters specified in <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_243\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">35. Such a view has been taken by the High Court of Kerala as\n\nearly as in 2006 and on the same lines, are the decisions of the\n\nother High Courts (Karnataka, Allahabad and Andhra Pradesh).\n\nBe it noted, the challenge to the decision of the High Court of\n\nKerala was unsuccessful before this Court in SLP (C) No.1671 of\n\n2009, which came to be dismissed on 2 nd February, 2009.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">36. Now we may turn to the decision in Standard Chartered\n\nBank (supra). The Court was called upon to consider the\n\nargument that secured creditor before invoking the remedy under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_244\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act, must necessarily make an attempt to\n\ntake possession of the secured assets and can take recourse\n\nthereto only if he fails in that effort and encounters resistance to\n\nsuch an attempt. While considering that argument, the Court\n\nanalysed <a href=\"/doc/152603276/\" id=\"a_245\">Sections 13</a>, <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_246\">14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/142297371/\" id=\"a_247\">15</a> of the 2002 Act and opined that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">\f                                      49</span>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_248\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act enables the secured creditor who\n\ndesires to seek the assistance of “State’s coercive power” for\n\nobtaining possession of the secured assets to make a request in\n\nwriting to the authority designated therein, within whose\n\njurisdiction the secured asset is located. It also noted that the\n\nauthority after receiving such request under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_249\">Section 14</a> of the\n\n2002 Act, was not expected to do any further scrutiny of the\n\nmatter except to verify from the secured creditor whether notice\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/122562177/\" id=\"a_250\">Section 13(2)</a> of the Act has already been given or not and\n\nwhether the secured asset is located within his jurisdiction.\n\nThere is no adjudication of any kind at this stage. The Court also\n\nnoticed in paragraph 23 of the reported judgment that after\n\namendment of <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_251\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act, by inserting first\n\nproviso therein, the designated authority has to satisfy itself only\n\nwith regard to the matters mentioned in clauses (i) to (ix). In\n\nparagraph 25 of this decision, the Court noted as follows:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">          “25. The satisfaction of the Magistrate contemplated\n          under the second proviso to <a href=\"/doc/74497336/\" id=\"a_252\">Section 14(1)</a> necessarily\n          requires the Magistrate to examine the factual\n          correctness of the assertions made in such an affidavit\n          but not the legal niceties of the transaction. It is only\n          after recording of his satisfaction the Magistrate can\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">\f                                      50</span>\n\n\n\n\n          pass appropriate orders regarding taking of possession\n          of the secured asset.”\n\n\nThe Court then went on to observe in paragraph Nos.33 and 36\n\nof the reported judgment as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">          “33. We are of the opinion that the High Court clearly\n          erred in recording such a conclusion. The language of\n          Rule 8 does not demand such a construction. On the\n          other hand, a Magistrate whose functioning is\n          structured by the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_253\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> is\n          required to act in accordance with the provisions of the\n          said Code unless expressly ordained otherwise by any\n          other law. It is not a case that <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_254\">Cr.P.C</a>. never prescribed\n          for the procedure to be followed by the Magistrate in a\n          case where the Magistrate is required to take\n          possession of property. For example, under Section 83\n          of the Code, a criminal court is authorised to attach\n          the movable or immovable property or both belonging\n          to a proclaimed offender. Sub­sections (3) and (4) to\n          Section 83 specifically provide that once an order of\n          attachment under sub­section (1) is made by the\n          criminal court, the property which is the subject­\n          matter of such attachment shall either be seized or\n          taken possession of as the case may be depending\n          upon the fact whether the property is movable or\n          immovable. Both the sub­sections contemplate the\n          appointment of Receiver. It is declared under sub­\n          section (6) that the powers, duties and liabilities of a\n          Receiver appointed under Section 83 are the same as\n          those of a Receiver appointed under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_255\">the Code of Civil\n          Procedure</a>, 1908.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">          XXX                XXX                XXX\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">          36. Thus, there will be three methods for the secured\n          creditor to take possession of the secured assets:\n          36.1.

(ii) The second situation will arise where the\n          secured creditor meets with resistance from the\n          borrower after the notice under Rule 8(1) is given. In\n          that case he will take recourse to the mechanism\n          provided under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_256\">Section 14</a> of the Act viz. making\n          application to the Magistrate. The Magistrate will\n          scrutinise the application as provided in <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_257\">Section 14</a>,\n          and then if satisfied, appoint an officer subordinate to\n          him as provided under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_258\">Section 14</a>(1­A) to take\n          possession of the assets and documents. For that\n          purpose the Magistrate may authorise the officer\n          concerned to use such force as may be necessary.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">          After the possession is taken the assets and\n          documents will be forwarded to the secured creditor.\n\n          36.3. (iii) The third situation will be one where the\n          secured creditor approaches the Magistrate concerned\n          directly under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_259\">Section 14</a> of the Act. The Magistrate\n          will thereafter scrutinise the application as provided in\n          <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_260\">Section 14</a>, and then if satisfied, authorise a\n          subordinate officer to take possession of the assets\n          and documents and forward them to the secured\n          creditor as under clause 36.2.(ii) above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">          36.4. In any of the three situations above, after the\n          possession is handed over to the secured creditor, the\n          subsequent specified provisions of Rule 8 concerning\n          the preservation, valuation and sale of the secured\n          assets, and other subsequent rules from the Security\n          Interest (Enforcement) Rules, 2002, shall apply.”\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">37. Concededly, the Court was not called upon to consider the\n\nspecific issue that arises for our consideration, in this batch of\n\ncases. To wit, whether the CJM is competent to deal with the\n\nrequest made by the secured creditor under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_261\">Section 14</a> of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">\f                                   52</span>\n\n\n\n\n2002 Act in the same manner as can be done by the CMM in\n\nmetropolitan   areas   and    DM    in   non­metropolitan    areas.\n\nNevertheless, what is significant to note is that this decision\n\nclearly delineates the nature of inquiry required to be conducted\n\nby the authority referred to in the <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_262\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act. By\n\nits very nature the inquiry, is an administrative or executive\n\nmeasure and to borrow the phrase used in the said judgment,\n\n“State’s coercive power” ­ for obtaining possession of the secured\n\nassets. It is possible to suggest that as the authority is required\n\nto make inquiry and pass an order, it would partake the colour of\n\nbeing a quasi­judicial inquiry. In any case, the stated authority is\n\nnot empowered to adjudicate on any issue(s) that may be raised\n\nregarding the rights of the concerned parties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"193688640\" id=\"span_125\">38. Reliance was also placed on the exposition in <a href=\"/doc/193688640/\" id=\"a_263\">Harshad\n\nGovardhan Sondagar</a> (supra), wherein the appellants claimed to\n\nbe tenants of a mortgaged premises (secured asset); and as\n\nborrowers (landlord/owner thereof) had committed default, the\n\nsecured creditor had invoked provisions of 2002 Act to enforce\n\nthe secured asset. In that backdrop, application was moved\n\nbefore the CMM, Mumbai under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_264\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">\f                                  53</span>\n\n\n\n\ntake possession of the premises and handover the possession\n\nthereof to the secured creditor. While dealing with the challenge\n\nto this action of the secured creditor, the Court noticing <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_265\">Section\n\n14</a> of the 2002 Act concluded that for the purpose of transferring\n\nthe secured asset and for realising the secured asset, the secured\n\ncreditor will require the assistance of the CMM or the DM for\n\ntaking of possession of a secured asset from the lessee, where the\n\nlease stands determined by any of the modes mentioned in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1134872/\" id=\"a_266\">Section 111</a> of the Transfer of Property Act. The Court then went\n\non to examine the question about the remedies available to the\n\nlessee where he is threatened to be dispossessed by any action\n\ntaken by the secured creditor under <a href=\"/doc/152603276/\" id=\"a_267\">Section 13</a> of the 2002 Act.\n\nIn that context, the Court noted that <a href=\"/doc/6431889/\" id=\"a_268\">Section 34</a> of the 2002 Act\n\nmakes it amply clear that no injunction can be granted by any\n\nCourt or other authority in respect of any action taken or to be\n\ntake in pursuance of any power conferred by or under the 2002\n\nAct. Even this decision, if we may say so, deals with entirely\n\ndifferent issue then the question under consideration in the\n\npresent cases.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">\f                                     54</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1977799\" id=\"span_128\">39. It is no more res integra that the CJM is equated with the\n\nCMM for the purposes referred to in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_269\">Cr.P.C</a>.; and those\n\nexpressions are used interchangeably being synonymous of each\n\nother. This Court in <a href=\"/doc/1977799/\" id=\"a_270\">All India Judges’ Association</a> (supra), in\n\nparagraph 31, opined as under:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">         “31. As we have already mentioned, the Shetty\n         Commission had recommended that the Chief\n         Metropolitan Magistrates should be in the cadre of\n         District Judges. In our opinion, this is neither proper\n         nor practical. The appeals from orders passed by the\n         Chief Metropolitan Magistrates under the provisions of\n         the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_271\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> are required to be\n         heard by the Additional Sessions Judge or the\n         Sessions Judge. If both the Additional Sessions Judge\n         and the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate belong to the\n         same cadre, it will be paradoxical that any appeal from\n         one officer in the cadre should go to another officer in\n         the same cadre. If they belong to the same cadre, as\n         recommended by the Shetty Commission, then it\n         would be possible that the junior officer would be\n         acting as an Additional Sessions Judge while a senior\n         may be holding the post of the Chief Metropolitan\n         Magistrate. It cannot be that against the orders passed\n         by the senior officer it is the junior officer who hears\n         the appeal. There is no reason given by the Shetty\n         Commission as to why the post of the Chief\n         Metropolitan Magistrate be manned by the District\n         Judge, especially when as far as the posts of the Chief\n         Judicial Magistrates are concerned, whose duties are\n         on a par with those of the Chief Metropolitan\n         Magistrate, the Shetty Commission has recommended,\n         and in our opinion rightly, that they should be filled\n         from amongst Civil Judges (Senior Division).\n         Considering the nature and duties of the Chief\n         Judicial Magistrates and the Chief Metropolitan\n         Magistrates, the only difference being their location,\n         the posts of Chief Judicial Magistrate and Chief\n         Metropolitan Magistrate have to be equated and they\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">\f                                    55</span>\n\n\n\n\n          have to be placed in the cadre of Civil Judge (Senior\n          Division). We order, accordingly.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">40. Be it noted that <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_272\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act is not a\n\nprovision dealing with the jurisdiction of the Court as such. It is\n\na remedial measure available to the secured creditor, who\n\nintends to take assistance of the authorised officer for taking\n\npossession of the secured asset in furtherance of enforcement of\n\nsecurity furnished by the borrower. The authorised officer\n\nessentially exercises administrative or executive functions, to\n\nprovide assistance to the secured creditor in terms of State’s\n\ncoercive power to effectuate the underlying legislative intent of\n\nspeeding the recovery of the outstanding dues receivable by the\n\nsecured creditor. At best, the exercise of power by the authorised\n\nofficer may partake the colour of quasi­judicial function, which\n\ncan be discharged even by the Executive Magistrate. The\n\nauthorised officer is not expected to adjudicate the contentious\n\nissues raised by the concerned parties but only verify the\n\ncompliances referred to in the first proviso of <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_273\">Section 14</a>; and\n\nbeing satisfied in that behalf, proceed to pass an order to\n\nfacilitate taking over possession of the secured assets.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">\f                                     56</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">41. It is well established that no Civil Court can interdict the\n\naction initiated in respect of any matter, which a Debt Recovery\n\nTribunal or Debt Recovery Appellate Tribunal is empowered by or\n\nunder the 2002 Act, to determine and in particular, in respect of\n\nany action taken or to be taken in pursuance of any power\n\nconferred by or under the 2002 Act or under the <a href=\"/doc/1683455/\" id=\"a_274\">Recovery of\n\nDebts Due to Banks and Financial Institutions Act, 1993</a>. That\n\nhas been ordained by <a href=\"/doc/6431889/\" id=\"a_275\">Section 34</a> of the 2002 Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">42. The borrowers or the persons claiming through borrowers\n\nhad placed emphasis on <a href=\"/doc/33076222/\" id=\"a_276\">Section 35</a> of the 2002 Act. The same\n\nreads thus:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">          35.    The provisions of this Act to override other\n          laws.­ The provisions of this Act shall have effect,\n          notwithstanding anything inconsistent therewith\n          contained in any other law for the time being in force\n          or any instrument having effect by virtue of any such\n          law.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">43. The construction of this provision plainly indicates that the\n\nprovisions of the Act will override any other law for the time being\n\nin force. The question is: does the provisions of 2002 Act override\n\nthe provisions of the Cr. P.C., whereunder the functions to be\n\ndischarged by the CMM are similar to that of the CJM. Further,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">\f                                    57</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe expressions “CMM and CJM” are used interchangeably in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_277\">Cr.P.C</a>. and are considered as synonymous to each other. <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_278\">Section\n\n14</a>, even if read literally, in no manner denotes that allocation of\n\njurisdictions and powers to CMM and CJM under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_279\">Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure</a> are modified by the 2002 Act. Thus\n\nunderstood, <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_280\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act, stricto sensu, cannot be\n\nconstrued as being inconsistent with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_281\">Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure</a> or vice­versa in that regard. If so, the\n\nstipulation in <a href=\"/doc/33076222/\" id=\"a_282\">Section 35</a> of the 2002 Act will have no impact on\n\nthe expansive construction of <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_283\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act.\n\nWhereas, there is force in the submission canvassed by the\n\nsecured creditors (Banks), that <a href=\"/doc/116137496/\" id=\"a_284\">Section 37</a> of the 2002 Act\n\nanswers the issue under consideration. The same reads thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">          “37 ­ Application of other laws not barred.­ The\n          provisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder\n          shall be in addition to, and not in derogation of, the\n          <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_285\">Companies Act, 1956</a> (1 of 1956), the <a href=\"/doc/220169/\" id=\"a_286\">Securities\n          Contracts (Regulation) Act, 1956</a> (42 of 1956), the\n          <a href=\"/doc/1365176/\" id=\"a_287\">Securities and Exchange Board of India Act</a> 1992 (15\n          of 1992), the <a href=\"/doc/1683455/\" id=\"a_288\">Recovery of Debts Due to Banks and\n          Financial Institutions Act, 1993</a> (51 of 1993) or any\n          other law for the time being in force.”\n\nThe bare text of this provision predicates that the provisions of\n\nthe 2002 Act or the Rules made thereunder shall be in addition\n\nto the stated enactments or “any other law for the time being in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">\f                                     58</span>\n\n\n\n\nforce”. Having said that the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_289\">Section 14</a> of the\n\n2002 Act are in no way inconsistent with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_290\">Code\n\nof Criminal Procedure</a>, it must then follow that the provisions of\n\nthe 2002 Act are in addition to, and not in derogation of the\n\nCode.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">44. Suffice it to observe that keeping in mind the subject and\n\nobject of the 2002 Act and the legislative intent and purpose\n\nunderlying <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_291\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act, contextual and purposive\n\nconstruction of the said provision would further the legislative\n\nintent. In that, the power conferred on the authorised officer in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_292\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act is circumscribed and is only in the\n\nnature of exercise of State’s coercive power to facilitate taking\n\nover possession of the secured assets.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">45. It would be apposite to now advert to <a href=\"/doc/1314522/\" id=\"a_293\">Section 17</a> of the\n\nGeneral Clauses Act, 1897. The same reads thus:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">          “17 ­ Substitution of functionaries.­(1) In any\n          [Central Act] or Regulation made after the\n          commencement of this Act, it shall be sufficient, for\n          the purpose of indicating the application of a law to\n          every person or number of persons for the time being\n          executing the functions of an office, to mention the\n          official title of the officer at present executing the\n          functions, or that of the officer by whom the functions\n          are commonly executed.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">\f                                          59</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"2269\" id=\"span_134\">(2) This section applies also to all [Central Acts] made\n              after the third day of January, 1868, and to all\n              Regulations made on or after the fourteenth day of\n              January, 1887.”\n\nThis Court in <a href=\"/doc/2269/\" id=\"a_294\">Janardhan Vs. State of Maharashtra62</a> was\n\ncalled upon to examine somewhat similar challenge. In that case,\n\nthe challenge was to the search warrant issued by the Assistant\n\nCommissioner of Police in respect of offences punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/80810563/\" id=\"a_295\">Section 6</a> of the Bombay Prevention of Gambling Act, 1887. The\n\nCourt repelled that challenge by relying on Section 17 of the\n\nBombay General Clauses Act, 1886, which is pari materia to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1314522/\" id=\"a_296\">Section 17</a> of the General Clauses Act, 1897. The Court opined\n\nthat though <a href=\"/doc/170826500/\" id=\"a_297\">Section 6</a> of the Gambling Act specified the office of\n\nCommissioner of Police as the authorised officer, however,\n\nconsidering the sweep of <a href=\"/doc/75295323/\" id=\"a_298\">Section 2(6)</a> of the Bombay Police Act,\n\n1951, which mentions that the term “Commissioner of Police”\n\nwould include an Assistant Commissioner, went on to hold that\n\nthe search warrant issued by the Assistant Commissioner was\n\nvalid. The Court, while dealing with the said challenge observed\n\nas follows:</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">62 (1978) 2 SCC 465\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">\f                           60</span>\n\n\n\n\n“8. Analysing this definition it would appear that\nany official title of the officer mentioned in any\nAct made after the <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_299\">General Clauses Act</a> would\ndeem by fiction of law to include any such official\ntitle referred to in any Act passed after the <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_300\">General\nClauses Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">9. Furthermore, not only the official title but even\nthe functions executed by the said officer would\nalso be deemed to have been exercised by the\nofficer designated in the subsequent Act. The\ncombined effect, therefore, of <a href=\"/doc/170826500/\" id=\"a_301\">Section 6</a> of the\nGambling Act and <a href=\"/doc/502279/\" id=\"a_302\">Section 17(1)</a> of the General\nClauses Act would be that the term “Commissioner\nof Police” would include all officers who are\nexecuting or performing the functions of the\nCommissioner of Police as defined or authorised\nunder the latter Act, namely, the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_303\">Police Act</a>. It\nwould thus be seen that sub­section (6) of <a href=\"/doc/266780/\" id=\"a_304\">Section 2</a> of\nthe Police Act clearly mentions that the term\n“Commissioner of Police” would include an Assistant\nCommissioner. Thus sub­section (6) runs thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">      “2.

(2) Every such Deputy Commissioner\n      shall,    under    the    orders    of   the\n      Commissioner, exercise and perform any\n      of the powers, functions and duties of the\n      Commissioner      to    be    exercised   or\n      performed by him under the provisions of\n      this Act or any other law for the time being\n      in force in accordance with the general or\n      special orders of the State Government\n      made in this behalf.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">10. The High Court has found as a fact that there was\na notification by the State Government dated March\n10, 1967 by which all the Assistant Commissioners of\nPolice including that of Nagpur were conferred powers\nand functions of the Commissioner of Police. Thus, in\nthe instant case at the time when the offence was\ncommitted two things had happened: (1) that in\nNagpur where the offence had taken place there was a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">\f                                    62</span>\n\n\n\n\n         Commissioner of Police, and (2) that the Commissioner\n         of Police had been conferred the power by the\n         Government notification to assign his functions,\n         powers and duties to the Assistant Commissioner. In\n         these circumstances, therefore, we do not find any\n         difficulty in accepting the contention of the\n         respondent that having regard to the combined\n         reading of the provisions of Section 17 of the\n         General Clauses Act and the Police Act the term\n         “Commissioner of Police” appearing in <a href=\"/doc/170826500/\" id=\"a_312\">Section 6</a> of\n         the Gambling Act would include even an Assistant\n         Commissioner who was legally and validly assigned\n         the powers, functions and duties of the\n         Commissioner of Police by the State Government\n         under <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_313\">Section 10(2)</a> of the Police Act. <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_314\">As the\n         General Clauses Act</a> was a statute which was passed\n         before the <a href=\"/doc/78032902/\" id=\"a_315\">Gambling Act</a> came into force, <a href=\"/doc/1314522/\" id=\"a_316\">Section 17</a> of\n         the General Clauses Act could be called into aid to\n         interpret the scope and ambit of the term\n         “Commissioner of Police” as used in <a href=\"/doc/170826500/\" id=\"a_317\">Section 6</a> of the\n         Gambling Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">         11. Learned counsel for the appellant, however,\n         submitted that the power of assignment of functions\n         by the Government given to the Commissioner of\n         police or the Assistant Commissioner could be\n         exercised only in respect of matters covered by the\n         <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_318\">Police Act</a> and not beyond that. I am however unable\n         to agree with this contention which completely\n         overlooks the avowed object of <a href=\"/doc/1314522/\" id=\"a_319\">Section 17</a> of the\n         General Clauses Act which has been passed to resolve\n         such anomalies and it is not possible to construe the\n         provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_320\">Police Act</a> in complete isolation by\n         ignoring the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/905940/\" id=\"a_321\">General Clauses Act</a>\n         which undoubtedly apply to the facts and\n         circumstances of the present case. For these reasons,\n         therefore, the second contention put forward by the\n         appellant also fails.”\n                                                 (emphasis supplied)\n\nIn the concurring judgment, additionally, the Court observed\n\nthus:\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">\f                            63</span>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">“19. It remains for consideration whether the Assistant\nCommissioner of Police could be said to be executing\nthe functions of the Commissioner of Police under\n<a href=\"/doc/1030013/\" id=\"a_322\">Section 6(1)</a> of the Act at the time when he issued the\nspecial warrant. Reference in this connection may be\nmade to <a href=\"/doc/20594794/\" id=\"a_323\">Section 11(2)</a> of the Bombay Police Act, 1951,\nwhich provides as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">      “11. (2) An Assistant Commissioner\n      appointed under sub­section (1) shall\n      exercise such powers and perform such\n      duties and functions as can be exercised\n      or performed under the provisions of this\n      Act or any other law for the time being in\n      force or as are assigned to him by the\n      Commissioner under the general or\n      special orders of the State Government.”\n\nIt was therefore permissible for the Assistant\nCommissioner of Police not only to exercise such\npowers and perform such duties and functions as he\ncould, in terms, exercise or perform under the\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/109320082/\" id=\"a_324\">Bombay Police Act</a>, or any other law\nfor the time being in force, but also the duties and\nfunctions assigned to him by the Commissioner of\nPolice under the general or special orders of the State\nGovernment. The High Court has taken note in this\nconnection of the State Government Order APO­3463­\nC­2896­(III)­(E)­V, dated March 10, 1967, which\nempowered all Commissioners of Police to assign to\nthe Assistant Commissioners of Police working under\nthem any of their powers, duties and functions not\nonly under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/109320082/\" id=\"a_325\">Bombay Police Act,\n1951</a>, but also under any other law for the time being\nin force. The existence of such an order has not in fact\nbeen     challenged    before    us.    The    Assistant\nCommissioner of Police was therefore the functionary\nwho could, by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/37834850/\" id=\"a_326\">Section 17</a> of the Bombay\nGeneral Clauses Act, discharge the functions of the\nCommissioner of Police under <a href=\"/doc/1030013/\" id=\"a_327\">Section 6(1)</a> of the Act in\nthe matter of issuing a special warrant like the one\nissued in the present case. It is also not disputed that\nthe Commissioner of Police issued Order 2036, dated\nSeptember 19, 1967, authorising all Assistant\nCommissioners of Police working under him to issue\nsearch warrants under <a href=\"/doc/1030013/\" id=\"a_328\">Section 6</a> of the Act to any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">\f                                       64</span>\n\n\n\n\n           Police Officer working under them not below the rank\n           of a Sub­Inspector of Police. As has been shown, this\n           was legally permissible, and it is futile to contend that\n           the High Court erred in rejecting the appellant’s\n           contention to the contrary.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_73\">46. Applying the principle underlying this decision, it must\n\nfollow that substitution of functionaries (CMM as CJM) qua the\n\nadministrative and executive or so to say non­judicial functions\n\ndischarged by them in light of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_329\">Cr.P.C</a>., would\n\nnot be inconsistent with <a href=\"/doc/1415534/\" id=\"a_330\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act; nay, it would\n\nbe a permissible approach in the matter of interpretation thereof\n\nand would further the legislative intent having regard to the\n\nsubject and object of the enactment. That would be a meaningful,\n\npurposive and contextual construction of <a href=\"/doc/1415534/\" id=\"a_331\">Section 14</a> of the 2002\n\nAct, to include CJM as being competent to assist the secured\n\ncreditor to take possession of the secured asset.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">47. Having said this, we need not to dilate on other decisions\n\npressed into service regarding the approach to be adopted in the\n\nmatter of interpretation of statutes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">48. To sum up, we hold that the CJM is equally competent to\n\ndeal with the application moved by the secured creditor under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">\f                                  65</span>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1415534/\" id=\"a_332\">Section 14</a> of the 2002 Act. We accordingly, uphold and approve\n\nthe view taken by the High Courts of Kerala, Karnataka,\n\nAllahabad and Andhra Pradesh and reverse the decisions of the\n\nHigh Courts of Bombay, Calcutta, Madras, Madhya Pradesh and\n\nUttarakhand in that regard. Resultantly, it is unnecessary to\n\ndilate on the argument of prospective overruling pressed into\n\nservice by the secured creditors (Banks).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">49.
