AGRAWAL, J.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">\tSonia [A-1] and Sanjiv [A-2], respondents in Criminal \nAppeal No. 895 of 2005, were tried and convicted by the trial \ncourt under Section 302 read with Section 34 and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_1\">Section \n120-B</a> of the Indian Penal Code [`<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>&#x27; for short] and sentenced \nto death and to pay a fine of Rs. 2000/- each.  A-1 and A-2 \nwere further convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1961417/\" id=\"a_3\">Sections 25</a>(1-B)(b) and 25(1-B(a) \nof the <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_4\">Arms Act</a>  respectively and sentenced to undergo \nrigorous imprisonment for a period of one year.  A-2 was \nfurther convicted under <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 201</a> IPC and sentenced to \nundergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay a \nfine of Rs. 1000/- in default whereof to further undergo \nimprisonment for one month.  The sentences were, however, \nordered to run concurrently.  Tried along with A-1 and A-2 \nwere eight other accused persons but they were acquitted by \nthe trial court for want of evidence. The order of convictions \nand sentences gave rise to a murder reference by the Sessions \nJudge, Hisar and appeals by both the accused before the \nPunjab &amp; Haryana High Court.  By the impugned judgment, \nwhile upholding their convictions under Section 302 read with \n<a href=\"/doc/968081/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 34</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 120-B</a> of the IPC and other provisions, \nthe High Court has commuted the sentence of death into life \nimprisonment.   Hence these appeals by special leave. \n\t While Criminal Appeal Nos. 895 of 2005 and 894 of 2005 \nhave been preferred by Ram Singh, brother of deceased \u0016 Relu \nRam, and the State of Haryana respectively for enhancement \nof sentence from life imprisonment to death, Criminal Appeal \nNo.142 of 2006 is by the accused assailing the impugned \njudgment of their convictions and sentences. \nThe case of the prosecution is that on 23.8.2001 when \nJeet Singh [PW 57], one of the employees of deceased - Relu \nRam, and A-2 were sitting at the Saw Mill located by the side \nof Farm House of Relu Ram, a telephone call was received by \nA-2 from A-1 conveying her desire to celebrate Priyanka&#x27;s \n[deceased sister of A-1] birthday at the Kothi at Litani Mor \n[place of occurrence] and that she would bring her from the \nhostel of Jindal School at Hisar \u0016 the school she was studying \nin.  At about 9.30 p.m.  A-1 along with Priyanka reached home \nin a jeep.  Thereafter, between 11 \u0016 12 p.m., on hearing some \nnoise of footsteps, PW 57, who was present at the Farm \nHouse, woke up and noticed that light in the room, where the \nspare parts of tractors etc. were kept, was on and upon \ninquiry found that A-1 was there in the room and he saw her \ntaking a rod to the first floor which rod is used for \nraising/tilting the tractor from the ground.  He again heard \nthe noise of explosion of fire works, but, thinking that \nPriyanka&#x27;s birthday was being celebrated, he went to sleep.   \nPW 57 further stated that on 24.8.2001 at about 4.45 a.m.  \nwhen he was sitting on his cot, he saw A-1 coming down and \ntaking the Jeep at a very fast speed and returning after half an \nhour.  Thereafter, at about 5.30 a.m.  Ram Phal, the Milk \nVendor, brought milk, but on seeing him coming upstairs, A-1 \ninstructed him to leave the milk on the ground floor.  At about \n6.15 a.m. the School Van came to take Lokesh [deceased], son \nof Sunil [deceased], but it left after waiting for some time as \nLokesh did not come down despite blowing of horn.  PW 57 \nthereafter sent Rohtas, another servant of Relu Ram, to the \nfirst floor for bringing Lokesh down for being dropped in the \nSchool on motor-cycle.    Upon being called by Rohtas, PW 57 \nwent to the first floor and found that A-1 was lying in the \nporch with froth coming out of her mouth and was mumbling \nthat she be saved and Sanjiv [A-2] be called.  Reaching inside \nthe house, PW 57 found that Relu Ram [father], Krishna \n[mother], Sunil [brother], Shakuntala [sister-in-law], Priyanka \n@ Pamma [sister], Lokesh [nephew] and Shivani and Preeti \n[nieces] of A-1 had been murdered in different rooms.  He also \nfound that Shakuntla&#x27;s hands and feet were tied with cot.   \nThe tractor rod that PW 57 had seen A-1 removing from the \nroom on the previous night was lying on the bed of A-1.  \nNoticing a letter [Suicide Note \u0016 Ext. 227] lying on the bed of A-\n1 written in Hindi, PW 57 picked up the same and left for the \nUlkana Police Station.  While giving description of what had \nbeen seen by him at the place of occurrence and handing over \nthe said Suicide Note to S.I. Vinod Kumar,  PW 59, PW 57 also \nstated that  it may be possible that A-1 under a conspiracy \nhad either administered some poisonous substance or made \nthem to inhale poisonous thing and upon becoming \nunconscious they had been murdered.  It was further stated \nby him that about six months prior to this incident, A-1 with \nan intention to kill deceased Sunil had also fired a shot from \nthe licensed gun of deceased Relu Ram over a dispute of \nproperty, but the matter was hushed up in the house.\nOn the basis of sequence of events that had taken place \nat the place of occurrence from the evening of 23rd August \nuntil 24th morning, described by PW 57 to PW 59 and the \nSuicide Note alleged to have been written by A-1, FIR was \nregistered in the Ulkana Police Station at 8.15 a.m.  by PW 59 \nwherein contents of Suicide Note were also reproduced.\n\tOn completion of the investigation, chargesheet was \nsubmitted against A-1, A-2 and eight other accused persons, \ncognizance taken and they were committed to the court of \nSessions to face trial. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">\tDefence of the accused persons was that they were \ninnocent and falsely implicated.  The stand taken by A-1 was \nthat she was picked up by the police of CIA Staff on 24th \nAugust from Faridabad and was brought to Hisar, kept in \nillegal custody, tortured and threatened that in case she would \nnot make the statement according to what they say, her only \nson would be killed and thereafter  they forcibly obtained her \nsignatures on blank papers.  A-2 took the defence, inter alia, \nthat he was falsely implicated at the instance of the employees \nof Relu Ram who had embezzled a lot of money of his father-\nin-law and by those people who had  taken a loan from him  \nand that it were they who had committed the murder of Relu \nRam and his family members.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">So far as A-1 is concerned, the prosecution case \nprincipally rests on (1) the Suicide Note [Ext. 227] alleged to \nhave been written by her wherein she admitted having \nmurdered eight persons, including three tiny tots, who were \nnone other than her own immediate family members, (2) the \njudicial confession [Ext. 187] made by her to the Magistrate in \nthe hospital where she was removed by the Police immediately \nafter the occurrence and (3) bloodstained clothes of A-1, blood \ngroup of which tallied with the blood group of deceased Sunil \nand Lokesh. \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">So far as A-2 is concerned, the case of the prosecution \nrevolves around circumstantial evidence, extra-judicial \nconfessions made by him to Sunder Singh, PW.48, and Rajni \nGandhi, Scientific Assistant, PW 17, the result of the \npolygraph test to which he was put by the prosecution and the \nrecoveries made at his instance by the police.  \nMr. Sushil Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing on \nbehalf of the respondents, has submitted that the suicide story \nis a total concoction by the prosecution as, even according to \nthe medical evidence, A-1 did not show any symptom of having \nconsumed poison, she was not administered any treatment as \nsuch, though prescribed and, therefore, her having not \nconsumed any poison, there was no reason for her to write the \nalleged Suicide Note, as there was no risk to her life, which, he \nsays, is a document that she was forced to write after having \nbeen tortured in police custody. So far as judicial confession \n[Ext. 187] made by A-1 to Pardeep Kumar, Judicial Magistrate, \n1st Class [PW 62] is concerned, his submission is that it  is a \npiece of evidence which needs to be eschewed from \nconsideration by this Court on two counts \u0016 i.e., admissibility \nand truthfulness  as the approach of the  recording magistrate  \nwas very casual  and it has not been recorded according to the \nprocedure prescribed by <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 164</a> of the Criminal Procedure \nCode [`<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_9\">Cr.PC</a>&#x27; hereinafter]. According to the learned counsel, \nnon-compliance of Section 164 by the recording magistrate \ncannot be cured by <a href=\"/doc/1889608/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 463</a> Cr.P.C. as it cures only the \ndefect of recording the statement and not its non-compliance.  \n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"549957\" id=\"span_1\">In support of this submission, reliance has been placed by the \nlearned counsel upon the decisions in the cases of <a href=\"/doc/549957/\" id=\"a_11\">Nazir \nAhmad v. King Emperor</a> AIR 1936 PC 253, Preetam v. State \nof M.P.  (1996) 10 SCC 432, and Tulsi Singh v. State of \nPunjab (1996) 6 SCC 63. Learned counsel further submits \nthat since it is not and cannot be disputed that A-1 was \nremoved from the place of occurrence to the hospital by Head \nConstable Ashok Kumar [PW.25], she came to be under police \ncustody since the time of her such removal until her formal \narrest by the police on 26th August, 2001 and her movements \nhaving been restricted and she having been kept under direct \nor indirect police vigil, as per the legal position, she was in \npolice custody.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"630635\" id=\"span_2\">In support of this submission, he has placed \nreliance upon <a href=\"/doc/630635/\" id=\"a_12\">Paramhansa Jadab &amp; Anr. Vs. State</a>, AIR 1964 \nOrissa 144.  Learned senior counsel has also pointed out other \ninfirmities in the prosecution case, such as tampering of \nhospital record [Exts. P-193 and P-192], non-lifting of \nfingerprints from the iron rod used to commit the crime and \nante-timing of FIR.</span> \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1549385\" id=\"span_3\">On the other hand, Mr.K.T.S. Tulsi, learned senior \ncounsel appearing on behalf of the appellant in Criminal \nAppeal No. 895 of 2005 has submitted that in view of \nadmission by A-1 in the Suicide Note as well as in the judicial \nconfession [Ext. 187] made to PW 62 of having committed the \nmurder and handwriting on the Suicide Note having been \nproved to be that of A-1, there is no scope left for doubting the \nveracity of the prosecution case.  It has been further \nsubmitted by Mr. Tulsi that insofar as judicial confession \nrecorded by PW.62 is concerned, it was recorded according to \nthe procedure set out in <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C. and that the \nalleged breach of Section 164(2) i.e., failure of magistrate to \nrecord reasons to believe that her statement was voluntary is a \ndefect curable by <a href=\"/doc/1889608/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 463</a> of the Cr.P.C. and is covered by \na decision of a 3-Judge Bench of this Court in the case of \n<a href=\"/doc/1549385/\" id=\"a_15\">Babu Singh vs. State of Punjab</a>, [1963] 3 SCR 749.  Adopting \nthe line of argument identical to that of Mr. Tulsi, Mr. U.U. \nLalit, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the State, \nsubmitted that even if there is a violation of <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 164</a> \nCr.P.C., the Court can admit such an evidence as the violation \nof that Section is cured by <a href=\"/doc/1889608/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 463</a> Cr.P.C. if it had not \ninjured the accused in his defence on the merits.  \n\tWe shall first deal with the Suicide Note allegedly written \nby A-1. PW 57 \u0016 the informant \u0016 while lodging the FIR and in \nhis evidence stated that the Suicide Note was picked up by \nhim from A-1&#x27;s bed and thereafter he left for the Ulkana Police \nStation to lodge the FIR.   It was handed over by him to PW.59 \nwho, on the basis of  sequence  of events narrated by PW.57 \nthat had taken place at the place of occurrence and on the \nbasis of  Suicide Note, registered the FIR, making the Suicide \nNote as part and parcel of the FIR by reproducing its contents \ntherein.</span> \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">So far as presence of A-1 at the place of occurrence is \nconcerned, both PW.57 and PW 58  - Amar Singh, another \nemployee of deceased Relu Ram who was working as \nChowkidar and posted at the main gate of Kothi at Litani Mor \n[the place of occurrence], in their testimony have stated that \nthey had seen A-1 coming to the Kothi at Litani Mor along with \ndeceased Priyanka@Pamma in a Jeep between 9-10 p.m. on \n23rd  August, 2001, going out of the Kothi in the early hours of  \n24th August in a self-driven jeep at a very fast speed and \nreturning after half an hour.  This fact is corroborated by the \nevidence of Head Constable Dharambir Singh [PW.46] who, in \nhis evidence, has stated that while he was on patrolling duty \nat Surewala Chowk from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. on 24th August, \n2001, he had seen A-1 at 5.30 a.m. coming from the side of \nBarwala in a Tata Sumo driving at a very fast speed.  The \nevidence, which further lends support to this fact, is that of \nConstable Ashok Kumar [PW 25] and Chhabil Das, PW.64.  \nPW.25, who was asked by PW.59 along with other police \npersonnel to reach the place of occurrence, stated that on \nreaching the spot and seeing A-1 with froth coming out of her \nmouth, he removed and admitted her to the Janta Hospital at \nBarwala.   PW.64, who happened to be present at the place of \noccurrence, has stated that on seeing PW.25 taking A-1 to the \nhospital, he accompanied him to the hospital.  The application \n[Ext. P.152] moved by PW.25 to the doctor on duty with regard \nto the fitness of A-1 to make the statement and also the indoor \nchart [Ext. P.193] which bears the signature of PW. 64 depict \nthat she was brought by PW.25.  Mr. Sushil Kumar has drawn \nour attention to the omission made by PW.25 in his evidence \nthat this witness has nowhere stated that he was accompanied \nby PW.64.  This omission by PW.25, in our view, does not \naffect the case of the prosecution, especially in view of the fact \nthat the indoor chart of the hospital bears the signature of \nPW.64. Therefore, there is overwhelming evidence to show the \npresence of A-1 at the place of occurrence on the intervening \nnight of 23rd and 24th August and in the early hours of 24th \nAugust, 2001.   The trial court and the High Court have relied \non the evidence of PW 57, PW 58, PW 46, PW 25 and PW 64 \nafter close and careful scrutiny of the same. We have on our \nown considered the evidence on the point and we are satisfied \nthat the view taken by the trial court and the High Court is \ncorrect one. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">The factum of A-1&#x27;s presence at the place of occurrence \nhaving been established, we now proceed to discern whether \nthe Suicide Note was fabricated one.  In order to verify the \nhandwriting on the Suicide Note to be that of A-1, on \n10.9.2001 SI\u0016Ajit Singh [PW 27] moved an application before \nBalraj Singh [PW.26], the then SDM, Hisar, for taking \nspecimen signature and handwriting of A-1, which were taken \nand sent to FSL, Madhuban for analysis. According to the \nreport submitted by FSL, Madhuban, in this regard, the \nhandwriting on the Suicide Note tallied with the specimen \nhandwriting.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">\tA bare perusal of Suicide Note which was addressed by \nA-1 to none other than A-2 [her husband], would show that in \nthe very first line she has confessed of having eliminated \neverybody and that she was ending her life as well.  In this \nvery letter of hers, A-1 has admitted having written it \nimmediately after the occurrence.  This fact stands proved by \nthe evidence of PW.57 who in his evidence has stated that he \npicked up the said letter from A-1&#x27;s bed and thereafter left for \nthe police station.  Therefore, there was no reason for any of \nthe police officials to be present at the place of occurrence \nfrom the time the crime was committed until the arrival of the \npolice officials after the lodgment of the FIR.  Both the courts \nbelow have relied upon the evidence of PW.57 and PW.26 on \nthis point and we see no reason to disbelieve their testimony.   \nIn this view of the matter, the submission of the learned \ncounsel that the Suicide Note was fabricated has to be \nrejected. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">This takes us to the next submission made by Mr. Sushil \nKumar that movements of A-1 having been restricted since the \ntime of her removal to the hospital until her formal arrest on \n26th August, 2001, she was kept under direct or indirect police \nsurveillance and, therefore, as per legal position, she was \nunder police custody.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"630635\" id=\"span_4\">In support of this submission, he has \nrelied on <a href=\"/doc/630635/\" id=\"a_18\">Paramhansa Jadab &amp; Anr. Vs. The State</a>, AIR 1964 \nOrissa 144, a decision of a Division Bench of Orissa High \nCourt.  We have been taken through the evidence of PW 25, \nDr. Jagdish Sethi [PW.52] and PW 62.  PW.25 has stated in his \nevidence that on his arrival at the place of occurrence, he saw \nA-1 lying in front of the main door under the porch of the first \nfloor of the house from where she was removed to the hospital.  \nThe factum of admission to the hospital stands proved from \nthe evidence of PW.52, who was on duty as the Casuality \nMedical Officer at the Janta Hospital, Barwala. In his \nstatement, PW.52 has stated that at the time of her admission \nto the hospital, A-1 was unfit to make any statement.  PW.62 \nin his evidence has stated that at the time of recording of \nconfessional statement of A-1, no police official was present \neither in the room in which the statement was recorded nor in \nthe vicinity of the hospital which fact has been confirmed in \nhis evidence by Dr. Anant Ram, PW 32, under whose care A-1 \nwas at the time the judicial confession was being recorded and \nwho was also present at the time of its recording. \nUndoubtedly, movements of A-1 were restricted, but it \nhappened not because of any direct or indirect vigil kept by \nthe police authorities, as is the contention of the learned \ncounsel, but because of the treatment that was administered \nto her in the hospital.  In her Suicide Note, A-1 towards the \nend has written that after finishing them all she was ending \nher life.  PW.52 has also stated that at the time of her \nadmission hers was a case of suspected poison and, therefore, \nshe was declared to be unfit to make any statement. There is \nnot an iota of evidence on record to show that in order to keep \nany direct or indirect vigil on the movements of A-1 the police \npersonnel remained present in or outside the room in which A-\n1 was recuperating or in the hospital since the time of A-1&#x27;s \nadmission until her discharge therefrom or that the police \npersonnel made frequent visits to the hospital, thereby \nrestricting A-1&#x27;s movement.</span>     \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"630635\" id=\"span_5\">In <a href=\"/doc/630635/\" id=\"a_19\">Paramhansa</a> [supra], reliance upon which has been \nplaced by the learned counsel, the question that arose was \nwhether the accused, who was formally arrested by the police \non 19.2.1962, could be said to be in police custody from the \nmoment when his movements were restricted and he was kept \nin some sort of direct or indirect police surveillance.  In the \nsaid case, the accused was interrogated on 17.2.1962 and \ntaken to the office of one Dr. Asthana on 18.2.1962.  \nAccompanied along with the police personnel were some other \npersons and while police personnel left Dr. Asthana&#x27;s office \nafter a while, the accused and other persons who accompanied \nthe police remained there.  Setting aside the conviction of the \naccused under Section 302/<a href=\"/doc/968081/\" id=\"a_20\">34</a> and allowing the appeal, it was \nheld at page 148 as under:</span>     \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;\u0005. in the circumstances of this case I \nwould hold that Paramhansa was in \npolice custody for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_21\">Section \n26</a> of the Evidence Act from the date of \nhis interrogation by the Inspector on \n17.2.1962 and that he continued to be in \npolice custody when he was brought and \nleft in Dr. Asthana&#x27;s residence on \n18.2.1962\u0005\u0005.  It is true that when this \nappellant made the confession before Dr. \nAsthana no police officer was near him.  \nBut some persons who came with the \npolice in the Police van were left there.  \nThus there was indirect control and \nsurveillance over the movements of the \nappellant by the police\u0005...&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"630635\" id=\"span_6\">Whether one is or is not in police custody could be \ndiscerned from the facts and circumstances obtaining in each \ncase.  Insofar as the case at hand is concerned, the police \nparty reached the place of occurrence within 10 minutes of \nlodgment of the FIR and PW.25, being aware of the fact that A-\n1 had consumed poison and under instructions, seeing A-1 \nlying in front of the porch, removed her to the hospital.  PW.52 \nhaving opined that A-1 was unfit at the time of her admission \nin the hospital to give any statement, PW.62 and PW.32 also \nhaving stated in their evidence that none else, except them, \nwas present in the room in which the statement of A-1 was \nrecorded and in the absence of any evidence to show that from \nthe moment of her admission to and discharge from the \nhospital the police personnel were either present in the room \nwherein A-1 was kept for treatment or even in the vicinity of \nthe hospital or they made frequent visits to the hospital, it \ncannot be said that the A-1&#x27;s movements were restricted or \nshe was kept in some sort of direct or indirect police \nsurveillance and that she was in police custody for the \npurpose of <a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 26</a> of the Evidence Act.   Therefore, in our \nview, <a href=\"/doc/630635/\" id=\"a_23\">Paramhansa</a> [supra] is of no help insofar as A-1 is \nconcerned.</span> \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">Turning now to the next submission of learned counsel \nappearing on behalf of the accused as to the judicial \nconfession [Ext.187] made by A-1 before PW.62, it would be \nuseful to refer to relevant provisions in the Criminal Procedure \nCode that deal with the recording of a judicial confession by a \njudicial magistrate and see whether the judicial confession \nrecorded by PW.62 of A-1 is according to the procedure \nprescribed by these provisions or whether any violation thereof \nhas been made by the magistrate while recording it.

Learned counsel \nappearing on behalf of the accused submits that as there was \nno danger to the life of A-1, there was no reason for the \nprosecution to call PW.62 for recording dying declaration of A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">1.  We have perused the   Indoor Charts of Janta Hospital, \n[Exts. 192 and 193] which clearly depict that hers was a case \nof suspected poison.  We have also been taken through the \nevidence of Dr. Jagdish Sethi, PW.52, who, in his testimony, \nhas also stated that A-1 was admitted to the Janta Hospital in \nthe morning of 24th August as a suspected case of poison and, \ntherefore, she was declared to be unfit to make any statement.   \nIn our view, the prosecution rightly sent for PW.62 for \nrecording dying declaration of A-1.   \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">Before adverting to the three decisions relied upon by the \nlearned counsel for the accused, we shall first analyse the \njudicial confession (Ext.187) recorded by PW 62 and see \nwhether it has been recorded according to the procedure \nprescribed by <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 164</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">   On 24th August, 2001, upon receipt of an application \nmoved by Superintendent of Police for recording dying \ndeclaration of A-1 by a magistrate, DSP Man Singh, who partly \ninvestigated the case, approached the Chief Judicial \nMagistrate, Hisar, who, in turn, marked the said application to \nPardeep Kumar, PW.62.   On its presentation to PW.62 by DSP \nMan Singh at 10 p.m. the same day, both PW.62 and DSP \nMan Singh left for the Janta Hospital, Barwala.   After \nreaching the hospital and before recording the statement, \nPW.62 first sought opinion of Dr. Anant Ram (PW 32) as to the \nfitness of A-1 to make the statement.  As in the opinion of PW \n32, A-1 was fit to make the statement, PW.62 proceeded to \nrecord it, which is in question and answer form.  It appears \nfrom Ext. 187 as well as from the questions and answers \nwhich were put to A-1 that PW.62 warned A-1 that she was \nnot bound to make any confessional statement and in case \nshe did so, it might be used against her as evidence.  In spite \nof this warning, A-1 volunteered to make the statement and \nonly thereafter the statement was recorded by PW.62.  In the \ncertificate that was appended to the said confessional \nstatement PW.62 has very categorically stated that he had \nexplained to A-1 that she was not bound to make a confession \nand that if she did so, any confession she would make might \nbe used as evidence against her and that he believed that the \nconfession was voluntarily made.  He further stated that he \nread over the statement to the person making it and admitted \nby her to be correct and that it contained a full and true \naccount of the statement made by her. It has been further \nstated by PW.62 in his evidence that at the time of recording of \nthe confession it was he and PW 32, who were present in the \nroom and there was neither any police officer nor anybody else \nwithin the hearing or sight when the statement was recorded.  \nIt also appears from the evidence of PW.62 that it took about \n2-1/2 hours for him to record the statement of A-1, which \nruns into 5 pages, which he started at 10.53 p.m. and ended \nat 1.28 a.m.  which goes to show that A-1 took her time before \nreplying to the questions put.  PW.62 has also stated that she \nhad given the statement after taking due time after \nunderstanding each aspect.  It also appears that he was \nsatisfied that she was not under any pressure from any \ncorner. Therefore, it is evident from the certificate appended to \nthe confessional statement by PW.62 that the confessional \nstatement was made by the accused voluntarily. Of course, he \nfailed to record the question that was put by him to the \naccused whether there was any pressure on her to give a \nstatement, but PW.62 having stated in his evidence before the \nCourt that he had asked the accused orally whether she was \nunder any pressure, threat or fear and he was satisfied that A-\n1 was not under any pressure from any corner, that in the \nroom in which the said confessional statement was recorded it \nwas only he and PW.32 who were present and none else and \nthat no police officer was available even within the precincts of \nthe hospital, the said defect, in our view, is cured by Section \n463 as the mandatory requirement provided under <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_28\">Section \n164(2)</a>, namely, explaining to the accused that he was not \nbound to make a statement and if a statement is made the \nsame might be used against him has been complied with and \nthe same is established from the certificate appended to the \nstatement and from the evidence of PW.62.  Therefore, in the \nlight of our discussion above, we have no hesitation in holding \nthat the judicial confession [Ext. 187] having been recorded \naccording to the procedure set out in <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 164</a> read with \nSection 281 and the defect made while recording the same \nbeing curable by Section 463, it is admissible in evidence.\nWe now advert to the decisions relied upon by the \nlearned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"549957\" id=\"span_7\">In the \ncase of <a href=\"/doc/549957/\" id=\"a_30\">Nazir Ahmad</a> [supra] the accused, who was charged \nwith dacoity and murder, was convicted on the strength of a \nconfession said to have been made by him to a Magistrate of \nthe class entitled to proceed under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_31\">Section \n164</a> relating to the recording of confession.  The confession \nwas not recorded according to the procedure and the record of \nthe confession was not available as evidence either.  The \nMagistrate, however, appeared as a witness and gave oral \nevidence about the making of the confession.   He stated that \nhe made rough notes of what he was told, got a memorandum \ntyped from the typist on the basis of the rough notes and \nthereafter destroyed the rough notes. The said memorandum, \nsigned by him contained only the substance but not all of the \nmatter to which he spoke orally. The recording Magistrate in \nthe said memorandum just above his signature appended a \ncertificate somewhat to the same effect as that prescribed in \n<a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_32\">section 164</a> and, in particular, stating that the Magistrate \nbelieved that the statements were voluntarily made.  As there \nwas no record in existence at the material time, there was \nnothing to be shown or to be read to the accused and nothing \nhe could sign or refused to sign. The Judicial Committee held \nthat the oral evidence of the Magistrate of the alleged \nconfession was inadmissible. The Magistrate offered no \nexplanation as to why he acted as he did instead of following \nthe procedure required by <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 164</a>. When questioned by \nthe Sessions Judge, the response of the accused was a direct \nand simple denial that he had ever made any confession. The \nJudicial Committee, considering the abject disregard by the \nMagistrate of the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 164</a> of the \nCode, observed that &quot;where a power is given to do a certain \nthing in a certain way the thing must be done in that way or \nnot at all&quot;.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"549957\" id=\"span_8\"><a href=\"/doc/549957/\" id=\"a_35\">Nazir</a> [supra] is a case where recording Magistrate \ndid not at all follow the procedure prescribed by <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 164</a> of \nthe Code as a result of which, he violated the provisions \nthereof whereas in the case on hand the omission that has \nbeen made by the magistrate is his failure to record the \nquestion that he asked to the accused whether she was under</span> \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">any pressure, threat or fear to make a confession in the \nconfessional statement and the answer given by A-1.  In his \nevidence before the Court, PW.62 stated that he asked A-1 \nwhether she was under any pressure, threat or fear and after \nhe was satisfied that she was not under any pressure from any \ncorner, he recorded in the memorandum that was appended to \nthe confessional statement of A-1 that he believed that the \nconfession was voluntarily made.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"549957\" id=\"span_9\">In our view, <a href=\"/doc/549957/\" id=\"a_37\">Nazir</a> [supra] \nhas no application to the facts of the present case as the \nfailure of PW.62 to record the question put and the answer \ngiven in the confessional statement has not caused prejudice \nto the accused in her defence and is a defect that is curable \nunder Section 463.</span> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">In the case of Preetam [supra] the accused was arrested \non 17.6.1973 and when produced before the Magistrate on the \nfollowing day he was sent to police custody, where he \nremained until 22.6.1973 and, thereafter he was sent to \njudicial custody. Upon being produced before a Magistrate on \n25.6.1973 for recording his confession, he was given two \nhours time to reflect.  After cautioning the accused that he \nwas not bound to make a confession and that if he did so, it \nmight be used against him, the Magistrate went on to record \nhis confession. Failure of the recording Magistrate to put \nquestions to the accused to satisfy himself that the confession \nwas voluntary so as to enable him to give the requisite \ncertificate under sub-section (4) was termed by this Court as \nflagrant violation of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 164(2)</a> and in \nutter disregard of the mandatory requirements of the said \nsection.  Preetam (supra) is a case where the accused \nremained in police custody for six days immediately before the \nrecording of his confession by the Magistrate and, therefore, \ncould be said to have been pressurized, tortured and harassed \nby the police.  In such a situation, omission on the part of the \nrecording Magistrate to put a question to the accused to \nsatisfy himself that the confession was being made voluntarily \ncan be said to be flagrant violation of law.  However, in the \ncase on hand, A-1 was removed by the police from the place of \noccurrence to the hospital in the morning of 24th August, 2001 \nwhere she remained until her arrest by the police in the \nevening of 26th August, 2001. It was at 10.58 p.m. on 24th \nAugust, 2001, i.e., during her hospitalization, that PW 62 \nrecorded her confessional statement after cautioning her that \nshe was not bound to make any confession and that if she did \nso, it might be used as evidence against her. PW 62 in his \nevidence has stated that it was only after administering the \nabove caution and satisfying himself that A-1 was making the \nstatement voluntarily that he proceeded on to record her \nconfession.  It also appears from his evidence that no police \nofficial was present either in the room in which he recorded \nthe confessional statement of A-1, or in the hospital. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">Therefore, in the absence of any evidence to show that she was \nunder direct or indirect vigil of the police authorities during \nher hospitalization and she having already confessed the crime \nin her Suicide Note, the omission on the part of the recording \nMagistrate to record the question and the answer given in the \nconfessional statement cannot be said to be flagrant violation \nof law, especially in view of the fact that the recording \nMagistrate has stated in his evidence that he orally asked A-1 \nif she was under any pressure, threat or fear and it was only \nafter satisfying himself that she was not under any pressure \nfrom any corner that he recorded her confessional statement.  \nIn the certificate that was appended to the confessional \nstatement as well, PW 62 has stated that he believed that \nconfession that A-1 made was voluntary.  In our view, the \ndefect committed being curable under Section 463 has not \ninjured the accused in her defence on the merits and that she \nduly made the statement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">Similarly, in the case of Tulsi Singh [supra], also relied \nupon by the learned counsel for the accused, the recording \nMagistrate did not explain to the accused that he was not \nbound to make a confession and that if he did so, it might be \nused against him, nor did he put any question to him to \nsatisfy that the confession was being voluntarily made \nalthough, an endorsement to this effect was made by him in \nthe certificate that was appended to the confessional \nstatement.  This court, while setting aside the conviction and \nsentence recorded against the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 302</a> IPC, \nheld that the special court was not at all justified in \nentertaining the confession as a voluntary one, observing that \nmere endorsement would not fulfill the requirements of sub-\nsection (4) of <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 164</a>.  This case too has no application at \nall to the facts of the present case for two reasons \u0016 firstly, in \nthis case too the appellant remained in police custody for a \nweek and secondly, it is a case in which the recording \nMagistrate neither explained to the accused that he was not \nbound to make a confession and if he did so, it might be used \nagainst him nor satisfied himself upon questioning the \naccused that the confession was being voluntarily made.  In \nthe case on hand, PW 62 in his evidence has stated that he did \nask the accused the question whether she was under any \npressure, threat or fear and only after satisfying himself that \nshe was not under any, that he proceeded on to record her \nconfessional statement. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"549957\" id=\"span_10\">Therefore, in view of our above discussion, the three \ndecisions relied upon by the learned counsel for the accused \nin the cases of <a href=\"/doc/549957/\" id=\"a_41\">Nazir</a> (supra), Preetam (supra) and Tulsi \n(supra) are of no help to the accused.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1549385\" id=\"span_11\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1549385/\" id=\"a_42\">Babu Singh</a> [supra], reliance on which has \nbeen placed by Mr. Tulsi, appearing on behalf of the appellant \nin Crl. Appeal No.895 of 2005, a 3-Judge Bench of this Court, \nwhile dealing with the question whether non-compliance of the   \nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 164</a> or Section 364 [Section 281 of the \nnew Code] is a defect which could be cured by Section 533 \n[Section 463 of the new Code] observed at page 759 thus:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;\u0005\u0005\u0005.Section 533(1) lays down that if \nany Court before which a confession \nrecorded or purporting to be recorded \nunder <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 164</a> or Section 364 is \ntendered or has been received in evidence \nfinds that any of the provisions of either \nof such sections have not been complied \nby the magistrate recording the \nstatement, it shall take evidence that \nsuch person duly made the statement \nrecorded; and it adds that \nnotwithstanding anything contained in \n<a href=\"/doc/205529/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 91</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, \n1872 such statement shall be admitted if \nthe error has not injured the accused as \nto his defence on the merits. Mr. Khanna \ncontends that the magistrate has in fact \ngiven evidence in the trial court and the \nevidence of the magistrate shows that the \nstatement has been duly recorded; and \nhe argues that unless it is shown that \nprejudice has been caused to the accused \nthe irregularity committed by the \nmagistrate in not complying with Section \n364(3) will not vitiate the confessions nor \nwill it make them inadmissible. There is \nsome force in this contention\u0005... But for \nthe purpose of the present appeals we are \nprepared to assume in favour of the \nprosecution that the confessions have \nbeen proved and may, therefore, be \nconsidered on the merits if they are \nshown to be voluntary and that is the \nalternative argument which has been \nurged before us by Mr. Rana.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">After observing that the confessions were duly recorded, \nthe Bench proceeded to discern from the factual matrix of the \ncase whether the confessions were voluntary or not and taking \nnote of three unusual features qua the confession recorded, \nnamely, (1) that the accused was kept in the police custody \neven after the substantial part of the investigation was over; \n(2) that the confession so recorded did not indicate as to how \nmuch time the accused was given by the magistrate before \nthey made their confessions and  (3) that the magistrate who \nrecorded the confession had taken part in assisting the \ninvestigation by attesting recovery memos in two cases, the \nconfessional statement of the accused was excluded from \nconsideration.  It was observed at page 764 thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;\u0005...Having regard to these features of the \ncase we are not prepared to uphold the finding \nof the High Court that the confessions made by \nthe appellants can be safely treated to be \nvoluntary in the present case. If the \nconfessions are, therefore, excluded from \nconsideration it is impossible to sustain the \ncharge of murder against either of the two \nappellants. In a case where the charge of \nmurder was founded almost exclusively on the \nconfessions it was necessary that the High \nCourt should have considered these relevant \nfactors more carefully before it confirmed the \nconviction of the appellants for the offence \nunder Section 302 and confirmed the sentence \nof death imposed on Babu Singh. In our \nopinion, if the confessions are left out of \nconsideration, the charge of murder cannot be \nsustained\u0005..&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1549385\" id=\"span_12\">The three unusual features noticed by the Bench in <a href=\"/doc/1549385/\" id=\"a_46\">Babu \nSingh</a> [Supra] impelled the learned Judges to exclude from \nconsideration the confessional statement made before the \nmagistrate by the accused after having observed that the \nconfession was admissible in evidence. As the charge of \nmurder was founded exclusively on the confession, both the \naccused persons were acquitted of the charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_47\">Section \n302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_48\">34</a> IPC.</span>    \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1549385\" id=\"span_13\">In our view, the factual matrix in <a href=\"/doc/1549385/\" id=\"a_49\">Babu Singh</a> [supra] was \ndistinct from the one with which we are dealing.  In Babu \nSingh, both the accused remained in police custody for a long \ntime and even after the substantial portion of the investigation \nwas over.  If one were or held to be in police custody, question \nof pressure, threat or fear would arise.  We have already held \nthat in the facts and circumstances of the present case, A-1 \ncannot be said to be in police custody during her \nhospitalization and, therefore, question of her being \npressurized, threatened or put under any kind of fear does not \narise.</span>  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"407511\" id=\"span_14\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/407511/\" id=\"a_50\">State of U.P. v.

The section only \npermits oral evidence to prove that the \nprocedure had actually been followed in \ncertain cases where the record which \nought to show that does not on the face \nof it do so.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">\tIn the light of the above discussion, we are of the view \nthat Ext.187 is admissible, having been recorded according to \nthe procedure prescribed under law and the same is voluntary \nand truthful. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">Turning now to the medical evidence, Dr. Sanjay Sheoran \n[PW.1], Dr. R.S. Dalal, [PW.2], and Dr. Arun Gupta [PW.15], \nwho conducted the autopsy on the dead bodies of the \ndeceased, have opined that the injuries found on the persons \nof the deceased were ante mortem in nature, were sufficient to \ncause death in ordinary course of nature and that injuries \ncould be caused with the iron rod. We have already referred to \nthe testimony of PW 57 wherein he stated that he had seen A-\n1 removing the iron rod from the store room at the place of \noccurrence on the night of 23rd August, 2001 which iron rod \nwas recovered from the bed of A-1 at the place of occurrence \nby the prosecution.  The medical evidence that injuries could \nbe caused with the iron rod, the statement of PW.57 that he \nhad seen A-1 removing the iron rod from the store room at the \nplace of occurrence and its recovery from the bed of A-1 leave \nno scope for any doubt about the veracity of the prosecution \ncase as against A-1. Finding of bloodstains on the salwar of A-\n1 and its matching with the blood group of deceased Sunil and \nLokesh further strengthens the case of the prosecution.  \n Insofar as other submissions made by learned counsel \nappearing on behalf of the accused qua ante-timing of FIR, \ntampering of Exts. 193 and 194 and non-lifting of finger prints \nare concerned, we need hardly add anything to the exhaustive \ndiscussion in the elaborate judgments rendered by the trial \ncourt and the High Court while dealing with identical \nsubmissions. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\"> As a result of our above discussion, we hold that the \ncase against A-1 has been proved by the prosecution beyond \nreasonable doubt and, therefore, order of conviction of A-1 \npassed by the trial court and upheld by the High Court is \nunassailable. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">We now proceed to consider the case of Sanjiv [A-2], \nhusband of A-1, whose case revolves around the \ncircumstantial evidence, apart from extra-judicial confessions \nmade by him to Sunder Singh, PW 48 and Dr. Rajni Gandhi, \nPW.17, the result of the polygraph test and the recoveries \nmade at his instance.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">Insofar as circumstantial evidence as against A-2 is \nconcerned, the courts below have very elaborately discussed \nthe material produced by the prosecution while accepting each \nof the circumstances.  In the normal course, there would have \nbeen no need for us to go into these circumstances as \nelaborately as was done by the two courts below in an appeal \nfiled under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution of India, especially \nwhen the finding qua conviction is concurrent.  However, \ntaking into consideration that the accused were awarded death \nsentence by the trial court, which has been converted into life \nimprisonment by the High Court, and that the case in hand is \none of circumstantial evidence, we think it appropriate and in \nthe interest of justice to reappreciate the evidence. \nThe principle for basing a conviction on the basis of \ncircumstantial evidence has been indicated in a number of \ndecisions of this Court and the law is well settled that each \nand every incriminating circumstance must be clearly \nestablished by reliable and clinching evidence and the \ncircumstances so proved must form a chain of events from \nwhich the only irresistible conclusion about the guilt of the \naccused can be safely drawn and no other hypothesis against \nthe guilt is possible. This Court has clearly sounded a note of \ncaution that in a case depending largely upon circumstantial \nevidence, there is always a danger that conjecture or suspicion \nmay take the place of legal proof. The Court must satisfy itself \nthat various circumstances in the chain of events have been \nestablished clearly and such completed chain of events must \nbe such as to rule out a reasonable likelihood of the innocence \nof the accused. It has also been indicated that when the \nimportant link goes, the chain of circumstances gets snapped \nand the other circumstances cannot in any manner, establish \nthe guilt of the accused beyond all reasonable doubts. It has \nbeen held that the Court has to be watchful and avoid the \ndanger of allowing the suspicion to make the place of legal \nproof, for some times unconsciously it may happen to be a \nshort step between moral certainty and legal proof. It has been \nindicated by this Court that there is a long mental distance \nbetween &#x27;may be true&#x27; and &#x27;must be true&#x27; and the same divides \nconjectures from sure conclusions. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">In the light of the above principle, which principle has \nbeen reiterated in a series of pronouncements of this Court, \nwe proceed to ascertain whether the prosecution has been able \nto establish a chain of circumstances so as not to leave any \nreasonable ground for the conclusion consistent with the \ninnocence of the accused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_34\">The first circumstance in the chain is the presence of A-2 \nat Hisar.  A-1 in her judicial confession made to PW.62 has \nstated that she along with A-2 had gone to the Jindal Public \nSchool to pick deceased Priyanka @ Pamma for celebrating her \nbirthday at the Kothi at Litani Mor, the place of occurrence.   \nA-1 has further stated that while they were returning, due to \nsome altercation between A-1 and A-2 which ensued after \nPriyanka @ Pamma informed A-2 of infidelity that A-1 was \nhaving with someone, A-2 got down of the vehicle at Hisar and \nwent away and did not return.  That getting down of A-2 on \nthe way after the altercation was a part of the plan hatched by \nA-1 and A-2 to give a slip to the investigating agency to \nmislead it, is discernable from the evidence of Paramjeet \nSingh, PW.12, who owns a Fast Food and Bakery Shop at \nCamp Chowk, Hisar.  In his evidence, he has stated that on \n23.8.2001, A-1 accompanied by a man and a girl visited his \nshop and that the accompanying girl was calling the man as \n&quot;Jijaji&quot;.  That A-2 did not alight from the vehicle on the way \nand was with A-1 all the time could be elicited from the \nstatement of A-1 made to PW.62, relevant portion of which is \nreproduced below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">&quot;\u0005\u0005At about 9 p.m. he [A-2] alighted \nfrom the vehicle at Hisar itself and \nstarted saying that he is having no need \nof her and I alone go to my home.  I \nwaited for 5/10 minutes that he would \ncome back, but he did not turn up.  After \nthat I along with my sister came to our \nhouse at Punia Farm House \u0016 Kothi at \nLitani Mor.  We reached at about 10.00 \np.m. in the Kothi. This is the talk of night \nof 23.8.2001. We purchased six pastries \nfrom the shop of Hisar for home. We, \nthe three ate two pastries on the shop \nitself. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">This fact is further supported by the statement of Ishwar \nSingh, PW.30, who in his testimony has stated that on \n23.8.2001 he had seen A-1 along with her sister and one \nanother person between 9-9.30 p.m. purchasing fruits from a \nrehri at Barwala and that person was Sanjiv whom he has \nidentified in Court.  The trial court as well as the High Court \nhave relied on the evidence of PW.12 and PW.30 after giving \ncogent reasons therefor.  In view of the evidence of PW.12 and \nPW.30 and the confession of A-1 [Ext. 187], we are of the view \nthat the prosecution has been able to establish that A-2 \naccompanied A-1 to the place of occurrence in the night of 23rd \nAugust, 2001. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">Insofar as participation of A-2 in the crime along with A-1 \nis concerned, our attention has been drawn to a photograph in \nwhich deceased Shakuntala is lying dead on the floor with her \nmouth, hands and feet tied which is indicative of the fact that \nbefore she was killed, she had shown resistance and in order \nto overpower her, her mouth, hands and feet were tied.  By no \nstretch of imagination it could be perceived that tying of \nmouth, hands and feet of a person could be possible by one \nperson. It would not have been possible for A-1 alone to tie \nmouth, hands and feet herself which further establishes the \nfact of presence of A-2 at the place of occurrence and his \nhaving participated in the crime along with A-1.  This is the \nsecond circumstance in the chain which stands established \nand points a finger towards none other than A-2 of his having \nparticipated in the crime with A-1. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">We now turn to the third circumstance and i.e., A-2&#x27;s \nclandestine exit from the place of occurrence.   We once again \nturn to the judicial confession made by A-1 to PW.62 wherein \nshe has admitted having left the place of occurrence in the \nmorning of 24th August and returning to it after half an hour, \nwhich fact stands proved from the statements of PWs.57 and \n58 as well.  Head Constable Dharam Singh, PW.46, who was \non patrolling duty at Surewala Chowk, has also stated in his \ntestimony that he saw A-1 driving Tata Sumo at a very fast \nspeed and going towards Narwana Chowk.  There was no \nreason for A-1 to leave the place of occurrence in the morning \nof 24th August after having taken a decision to end her life by \nconsuming poison.  Her leaving the place of occurrence and \ncoming back after half an hour to that very place lends further \nsupport to the evidence of PWs. 57 and 58.  That she initially \nthought of ending her life in accident and that is why she left \nthe place of occurrence in the morning in Tata Sumo and \nhaving decided against it on the way and returned to the place \nof occurrence after half an hour does not inspire confidence at \nall.   Therefore, in the absence of any infirmity in the evidence \nof PWs. 57, 58 and 46, which evidence is supported by none \nother than A-1 in her judicial confession made to PW.62, the \nthird circumstance stands also proved by the prosecution.   \n  In order to establish that A-1 had left the place of \noccurrence in the morning to take A-2 out therefrom in a \nclandestine way and leave her at a sufficient distance so as to \nbe not seen by anyone, we have also been taken through the \nevidence of Head Constable Dharambir Singh  [PW 46], \nconductor Jai Singh [PW.39], Rajesh Kumar  [PW.55], Jai Dev \nHans, [PW 45], Rajinder Parshad  [PW 43] and K.A. Khan [PW \n3].  PW. 46   in his testimony has stated that while he was on \npatrolling duty at Surewala Chock, he saw A-1 driving a \nvehicle at a very fast speed coming from Barwala side and \ngoing towards Narwana Chowk.  PW.39, who was the \nconductor of the bus that was plying on Hisar to Yamuna \nNagar route, in his testimony, has stated that on 24th August, \n2001 Bus No. HR 39/7090 started its journey from Hisar at 5 \nA.M. and that when it reached near Jajanwala, A-2, who was \nwearing pant and bushirt with a bag in his hand, boarded the \nbus and that he took the ticket from him for Kaithal.  He has \nfurther stated that A-2 alighted from the bus at Kaithal.  A-2 \nhas been identified by this witness in Court.  Rajesh Kumar, \nPW.55, a taxi driver, in his testimony has stated that on \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_35\">24.8.2001 when he was at the taxi stand at Kaithal, A-2 hired \nhis taxi at 7.30 a.m. for going to Panipat and that at that time \nhe was carrying a bag on his shoulder.  He has further stated \nthat on the way A-2 got down from the Taxi at Jaidev STD \nBooth at Kaithal to make a call to Saharanpur and that after \nmaking the call he boarded the taxi again and was dropped by \nhim at Panipat.  PW.45, who owned STD Booth at Kaithal, in \nhis deposition has confirmed the factum of A-2 having made a \ntelephone call from his STD booth on the morning of 24th \nAugust at Saharanpur on telephone No. 729285.  He has also \nidentified A-2 in Court.  That A-2 made a call at 7.20 a.m. on \n24th August from the STD Booth of PW.45 on telephone No. \n0132-729285 has been confirmed by PW.43 \u0016 Rajinder \nParshad, SDE of Telephone Exchange, Kaithal, on the basis of \nlist of outgoing telephone calls made from the said STD Booth \nin his testimony.   K.A. Khan, Divisional Engineer, Telephones, \nat Saharanpur, in his testimony has stated that telephone No. \n729285 on which A-2 made call from Kaithal stands in the \nname of Sanjiv Kumar.  Analysis of evidence of the aforesaid \nwitnesses leads to only one conclusion that A-1 had left the \nplace of occurrence in the morning of 24th August along with \nA-2 so as to provide him a safe exit and to give a slip to the \nprosecution. This is the fourth circumstance that the \nprosecution has been able to establish. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_36\">The fifth and the last circumstance in the chain on which \nthe prosecution has relied is the recovery of ash of the \nbloodstained clothes of A-1 and A-2 which were burnt by A-2 \nand chain and two buttons of the bag he was carrying to \nwhich we now advert.  During interrogation, A-2 disclosed that \nafter the occurrence his and A-1&#x27;s bloodstained clothes were \nput by him in a plastic bag and those were burnt by him in the \nfields near village Bhainswal. The police party thereafter was \ntaken to the place where A-2 had burnt his and A-1&#x27;s \nbloodstained cloths and plastic bag from where the police \nteam recovered the ash, chain and two buttons of the burnt \nplastic bag.  The fact that A-2 was carrying a bag in his hand \non 24th August, 2001 finds mention in the statements of PWs. \n39 and 55.  Therefore, in view of the recovery of ash of the \nbloodstained clothes and that of the bag at the instance of A-2, \nin our view, the prosecution has been able to establish this \nlast link also in the chain of circumstances.   \nWe now turn to the extra-judicial confession made by A-2 \nto Sunder Singh, PW.48, which, in the submission of learned \ncounsel appearing on behalf of the accused, having been made \nto a stranger, cannot be relied upon.  PW.48 \u0016 Sunder Singh, \nin his testimony, has stated that on receiving a message from \nBrahm Singh, cousin of A-1&#x27;s mother, on 17.9.2001, he went \nto Shamli and met Brahm Singh, who told him that Relu Ram \nand his family have been killed by both A-1 and A-2.  After \nsome time, A-2 also reached there and told PW.48 that he and \nhis wife have killed the entire Relu Ram family with iron rod \nand the reason given for committing the crime was that Relu \nRam was not parting with the share of A-1 in the property.  A-\n2 also told PW.48 about his clandestine entry to and exit from \nthe place of occurrence. On a suggestion made by PW.48 to A-\n2 to surrender before the police, A-2 promised him that he \nwould come on 19th September, 2001. PW.48 thereafter \ninformed the police about the incident on 17th September \nitself. On 19th September, 2001 Brahm Singh and PW.48 \nproduced A-2 at PWD Rest House, Panipat before DSP \nMahender Singh and he was arrested.  PW. 48, in his \ntestimony, has stated that A-2 himself told him about his \nclandestine ingress to and egress from the Kothi at Litani Mor \nby hiding himself in the middle seat of the vehicle and that he \nwas dropped by A-1 at Village Jajanwala on Narwana Road in \nthe morning. The confession made to PW.48 is supported by \nthe fact that the weapon used in the crime i.e., tractor rod, \nmention of which has been made by A-2 in his confession to \nPW.48, was found on the bed of A-1 and on the disclosure \nstatement made by A-2 to the police, the ash of the \nbloodstained clothes of his and A-1 and that of the bag \ncontaining the said clothes was also recovered.  \n Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused has \nsubmitted that PW.48 being a stranger to A-2 and Brahm \nSingh, who was not examined by the prosecution on the \npretext of having been won over, having been remotely \nconnected to PW.48 no reliance should be placed on the \nconfession made by A-2 before PW.48.   In our view, the \nsubmission has been made only to be rejected for the reason \nthat in his testimony PW.48 has stated that he had attended \nthe betrothal ceremony and marriage of A-2.  Therefore, \nquestion of his being stranger to A-2 does not arise. However, \nit is well settled by a catena of decisions rendered by this \nCourt that extra-judicial confession made even to a stranger \ncannot be eschewed from consideration if it is found to have \nbeen truthful and voluntarily made before a person who has \nno reason to state falsely.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"928028\" id=\"span_16\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/928028/\" id=\"a_57\">Gura Singh vs. State \nof Rajasthan</a>, (2001) 2 SCC 205, the evidentiary value to be \nattached to the extra-judicial confession has been explained at \npage 212 thus:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"70850146\" id=\"span_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1786180\" id=\"span_18\">&quot;It is settled position of law that extra-judicial \nconfession, if true and voluntary, it can be relied \nupon by the court to convict the accused for the \ncommission of the crime alleged. Despite inherent \nweakness of extra-judicial confession as an item of \nevidence, it cannot be ignored when shown that \nsuch confession was made before a person who has \nno reason to state falsely and to whom it is made in \nthe circumstances which tend to support the \nstatement. Relying upon an earlier judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1786180/\" id=\"a_58\">Rao \nShiv Bahadur Singh v. State of Vindhya Pradesh</a>, \nAIR 1954 SC 322, this Court again in <a href=\"/doc/70850146/\" id=\"a_59\">Maghar Singh \nv. State of Punjab</a>, (1975) 4 SCC 234, held that the \nevidence in the form of extra-judicial confession \nmade by the accused to witnesses cannot be always \ntermed to be a tainted evidence. Corroboration of \nsuch evidence is required only by way of abundant \ncaution. If the court believes the witness before \nwhom the confession is made and is satisfied that \nthe confession was true and voluntarily made, then \nthe conviction can be founded on such evidence \nalone.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"416055\" id=\"span_19\">In <a href=\"/doc/416055/\" id=\"a_60\">Narayan Singh v. State of M.P.</a>, (1985) 4 \nSCC 26, this Court cautioned that it is not open to \nthe court trying the criminal case to start with a \npresumption that extra-judicial confession is always \na weak type of evidence. It would depend on the \nnature of the circumstances, the time when the \nconfession is made and the credibility of the \nwitnesses who speak for such a confession. The \nretraction of extra-judicial confession which is a \nusual phenomenon in criminal cases would by itself \nnot weaken the case of the prosecution based upon \nsuch a confession.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"955616\" id=\"span_20\">In <a href=\"/doc/955616/\" id=\"a_61\">Kishore Chand v. State of \nH.P.</a>, (1991) 1 SCC 286, this Court held that an \nunambiguous extra-judicial confession possesses \nhigh probative value force as it emanates from the \nperson who committed the crime and is admissible \nin evidence provided it is free from suspicion, and \nsuggestion of any falsity. However, before relying on \nthe alleged confession, the court has to be satisfied \nthat it is voluntary and is not the result of \ninducement, threat or promise envisaged under \n<a href=\"/doc/967059/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 24</a> of the Evidence Act or was brought about \nin suspicious circumstances to circumvent <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_63\">Sections \n25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_64\">26</a>. The Court is required to look into the \nsurrounding circumstances to find out as to \nwhether such confession is not inspired by any \nimproper or collateral consideration or \ncircumvention of law suggesting that it may not be \ntrue. All relevant circumstances such as the person \nto whom the confession is made, the time and place \nof making it, the circumstances in which it was \nmade have to be scrutinized.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1575757\" id=\"span_21\">To the same effect is \nthe judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1575757/\" id=\"a_65\">Baldev Raj v.

Indisputably, extra-judicial confession was made by A-\n2 to PW.48 prior to his arrest by the police and, therefore, \nquestion of it being made under any inducement, threat or \npromise does not arise.  Moreover, there was absolutely no \nreason for PW 48 to unnecessarily implicate the accused, as \nhe had no animus against him.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">In view of our above discussion, we see no reason to \ndisbelieve the evidence of PW.48 and hold that A-2 made \nextra-judicial confession which is voluntary and truthful.\nInsofar as motive qua the crime committed is concerned, \nit is clearly borne out from the factual matrix of the case on \nhand that both the accused had an eye on the property of \ndeceased, Relu Ram, which was in crores and in order to gain \nfull control over the property and to deprive deceased Relu \nRam from giving it to anybody else, both the accused persons \nhave eliminated his whole family. We have been taken through \nthe extra-judicial confession made by A-2 to PW. 48 wherein \nhe has indicated that as deceased Relu Ram was not parting \nwith the share of A-1 in the property, both A-1 and A-2 \ntogether have done to death his whole family. Therefore, the \nmotive qua the crime committed stands proved in the present \ncase.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">We now turn to the extra-judicial confession made by A-2 \nbefore Rajni Gandhi, PW.17, wherein also A-2 stated that he \nand A-1 had murdered the deceased persons. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">Indisputably, the extra-judicial confession that A-2 has \nmade to PW.17 on 24th and 25th September, 2001 was made \nwhile he was in police custody, having been arrested on \n19.9.2001. It is apt to reproduce the relevant portion of the \nstatement made by PW.17 in her deposition which is to the \nfollowing effect:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">&quot;\u0005. On 24.9.2001 police brought Sanjeev \nKumar\u0005. for lie detection test.  After that \nmyself and Sanjeev Kumar accused \nconversed with each other in a room/library \nof the FSL Madhuban.  Police went away at \nthat time. \u0005After completing the formalities \nthat is of consent etc., I called for the police \nto take both the persons for lunch as by that \ntime, lunch interval has started and it was \nnecessary for a person not to be hungry while \ngoing through the lie detection test.  \u0005. When \nSanjeev Kumar was taken by the police for \nlunch on 24.9.2001, he was again brought \nafter lunch interval.  Then Sanjeev Kumar \nwas put on polygraph machine. Lie Detection \ntest continued for one and a half hour.  \nDuring that process, Sanjeev Kumar used to \nstop his breathe voluntarily and on that \naccount, Lie Detection Test could not be \nmade on that day.  I asked Sanjeev Kumar as \nto why he was doing, he told me that he was \npurposely doing it.  Thereafter Sanjeev \nKumar was brought before me on 25.9.2001 \nbecause on that day it was not possible to go \nthrough the lie detection test\u0005.. On \n25.9.2001 Sanjeev Kumar was brought by \nthe police at 9.30 a.m. in the office of FSL\u0005&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">The above statement of PW.17, therefore, clearly depicts \nthat A-2 was brought by the police to Forensic Science \nLaboratory [FSL], Madhuban, for the lie detection test on \n24.9.2001 and when she conversed with him the police party \nwent away.  On her saying, A-2 was taken by the police for \nlunch and thereafter brought back to the FSL.  As Lie \nDetection Test [LDT] was not possible on 24th September, A-2 \nwas again brought to FSL by the police on 25th September on \nwhich day the LDT was conducted.   \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused \nsubmits that temporary disappearance of the police from the \nscene leaving the accused in charge of a private individual \ndoes not terminate his custody and, therefore, the extra-\njudicial confession made by A-2 to PW.17 having been made in \npolice custody is inadmissible as it is hit by <a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 26</a> of the \nEvidence Act which provides that any confession made by any \nperson while he is in the custody of a police officer, unless it \nbe made in the immediate presence of a Magistrate, shall not \nbe proved as against such person. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"955616\" id=\"span_24\">In support of his \nsubmission, reliance has been placed on <a href=\"/doc/955616/\" id=\"a_69\">Kishore Chand vs. \nState of H.P</a> [(1991) 1 SCC 286].</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">\t <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"955616\" id=\"span_25\">In <a href=\"/doc/955616/\" id=\"a_70\">Kishore Chand</a> [supra], the question that arose \nbefore this Court was whether extra-judicial confession made \nby an accused to a Village Pradhan, in the company of whom \nthe accused was left by the police officer after apprehending \nhim, could be said to have been made while in police custody.  \nWhile answering the question in the affirmative, a 2-Judge \nBench of this Court at page 295 held as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">&quot;The question, therefore, is whether the \nappellant made the extra-judicial \nconfession while he was in the police \ncustody.

Therefore, it would be \nlegitimate to conclude that the appellant \nwas taken into the police custody and \nwhile the accused was in the custody, the \nextra-judicial confession was obtained \nthrough PW.10....&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"955616\" id=\"span_26\">Indisputably, A-2 was arrested on 19th September, 2001 \nand on 24th and 25th September when he was taken for the \nLDT he was in police custody and it was at that point of time \nhe made extra-judicial confession to PW.17 at which point of \ntime police personnel went away from the scene temporarily.    \nTherefore, in the light of the decision rendered in <a href=\"/doc/955616/\" id=\"a_71\">Kishore \nChand</a> [supra], we are of the opinion that extra-judicial \nconfession made by A-2 to PW.17 is hit by <a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 26</a> of the \nEvidence Act, it having been made by A-2 while in police \ncustody and, consequently, cannot be admitted into evidence \nand, therefore, has to be eschewed from consideration. \nHowever, even the exclusion of extra-judicial confession made \nby A-2 before PW.17 would be of no help to this accused as we \nare of the view that the prosecution has succeeded in proving \nits case beyond reasonable doubts against A-2 on the basis of \ncircumstantial evidence enumerated above as well as extra-\njudicial confession made by A-2 before PW.48.\nInsofar as the Polygraph [Lie Detection] Test which was \nconducted on A-2 is concerned, Mr. Sushil Kumar submits \nthat since polygraph evidence is not subject of expert evidence \nas per <a href=\"/doc/1025384/\" id=\"a_73\">Sec. 45</a> of Evidence Act being a science in mystique, it \ncould at best be used as an aid to investigation and not as an \nevidence.</span> In support of his submission, he has relied on \nRomeo Phillion and Her Majesty The Queen, (1978) 1 SCR \n18 and R. v.

The Penal Code prescribes death penalty as \nan alternative punishment only for heinous crimes, which are \nnot more than seven in number. <a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 354(3)</a> of the Criminal \nProcedure Code, 1973 in keeping with the spirit of the \nInternational Covenant, has further restricted the area of \ndeath penalty. Now according to this changed legislative \npolicy, which is patent on the face of Section 354(3), the \nnormal punishment for murder and six other capital offences \nunder the Penal Code, is imprisonment for life (or \nimprisonment for a term of years) and death penalty is an \nexception. The present legislative policy discernible from \nSection 235(2) read with Section 354(3) is that in fixing the \ndegree of punishment or making the choice of sentence for \nvarious offences, including one under Section 302, Penal \nCode, the Court should not confine its consideration \n&quot;principally&quot; or merely to the circumstances connected with \nthe particular crime, but also give due consideration to the \ncircumstances of the criminal. In many cases, the extremely \ncruel or beastly manner of the commission of murder is itself a \ndemonstrated index of the depraved character of the \nperpetrator. And it is only when the culpability assumes the \nproportion of extreme depravity that &quot;special reasons&quot; can \nlegitimately be said to exist. Judges should never be \nbloodthirsty. It is, therefore, imperative to voice the concern \nthat courts, aided by the broad illustrative guidelines \nindicated, will discharge the onerous function with evermore \nscrupulous care and humane concern, directed along the \nhighroad of legislative policy outlined in Section 354(3), viz., \nthat for persons convicted of murder, life imprisonment is the \nrule and death sentence an exception.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\"> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1201493\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"545301\" id=\"span_29\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/545301/\" id=\"a_80\">Machhi Singh v.

When the murder is committed in an extremely \nbrutal, grotesque, diabolical, revolting or dastardly \nmanner so as to arouse intense and extreme \nindignation of the community. For instance,  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">(i) when the house of the victim is set aflame with \nthe end in view to roast him alive in the house, (ii) \nwhen the victim is subjected to inhuman acts of \ntorture or cruelty in order to bring about his or her \ndeath; and (iii) when the body of the victim is cut \ninto pieces or his body is dismembered in a fiendish \nmanner.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">II. When the murder is committed for a motive \nwhich evinces total depravity and meanness. For \ninstance when (a) hired assassin commits murder \nfor the sake of money or reward or (b) a cold-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">blooded murder is committed with a deliberate \ndesign in order to inherit property or to gain control \nover property of a ward or a person under the \ncontrol of the murderer or vis-a-vis whom the \nmurdered is in a dominating position or in a \nposition of trust, or (c) a murder is committed in the \ncourse for betrayal of the motherland.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">III. (a) When murder of a member of a Scheduled \nCaste or minority community etc., is committed not \nfor personal reasons but in circumstances etc., \nwhich arouse social wrath. For instance when such \na crime is committed in order to terrorise such \npersons and frighten them into fleeing from a place \nor in order to deprive them of, or make them \nsurrender, lands or benefits conferred on them with \na view to reverse past injustices and in order to \nrestore the social balance. (b) In cases of &#x27;bride \nburning&#x27; and what are known as &#x27;dowry deaths&#x27; or \nwhen murder is committed in order to remarry for \nthe sake of extracting dowry once again or to marry \nanother woman on account of infatuation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">IV. When the crime is enormous in proportion. For \ninstance when multiple murders say of all or almost \nall the members of a family or a large number of \npersons of a particular caste, community, or \nlocality, are committed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">V. When the victim of murder is (a) an innocent \nchild who could not have or has not provided even \nan excuse, much less a provocation, for murder (b) \na helpless woman or a person rendered helpless by \nold age or infirmity (c) when the victim is a person \nvis-a-vis whom the murderer is in a position of \ndomination or trust (d) when the victim is a public \nfigure generally loved and respected by the \ncommunity for the services rendered by him and the \nmurder is committed for political or similar reasons \nother than personal reasons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1201493\" id=\"span_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1201493\" id=\"span_31\">In the said case, the Court further observed that in this \nbackground the guidelines indicated in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1201493/\" id=\"a_82\">Bachan \nSingh</a> (supra) will have to be culled out and applied to the \nfacts of each individual case and where the question of \nimposing death sentence arises, the following proposition \nemerge from the case of <a href=\"/doc/1201493/\" id=\"a_83\">Bachan Singh</a> (supra):-</span></span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">(i) \tThe extreme penalty of death need not be \ninflicted except in gravest cases of extreme \nculpability.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">(ii) \tBefore opting for the death penalty the \ncircumstances of the &#x27;offender&#x27; also require to \nbe taken into consideration along with the \ncircumstances of the &#x27;crime&#x27;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">(iii) \tLife imprisonment is the rule and death \nsentence is an exception. In other words death \nsentence must be imposed only when life \nimprisonment appears to be an altogether \ninadequate punishment having regard to the \nrelevant circumstances of the crime, and \nprovided, and only provided, the option to \nimpose sentence of imprisonment for life \ncannot be conscientiously exercised having \nregard to the nature and circumstances of the \ncrime and all the relevant circumstances.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">(iv) \tA balance-sheet of aggravating and mitigating \ncircumstances has to be drawn up and in \ndoing so the mitigating circumstances have to \nbe accorded full weightage and a just balance \nhas to be struck between the aggravating and \nthe mitigating circumstances before the option \nis exercised.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">The Court thereafter observed that in order to apply \nthese guidelines the following questions may be answered:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">(a) \tIs there something uncommon about the crime \nwhich renders sentence of imprisonment for \nlife inadequate and calls for a death sentence?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">(b) \tAre the circumstances of the crime such that \nthere is no alternative but to impose death \nsentence even after according maximum \nweightage to the mitigating circumstances \nwhich speak in favour of the offender?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">Ultimately, in the said case of Machhi Singh (supra), the \nCourt observed that if upon an overall global view of all the \ncircumstances in the light of the aforesaid proposition and \ntaking into account the answers to the questions posed \nhereinabove, the circumstances of the case are such that \ndeath sentence is warranted, the Court would proceed to do \nso.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">In the light of the law already <a href=\"/doc/1201493/\" id=\"a_84\">laid down by</a> this Court \n<a href=\"/doc/1201493/\" id=\"a_85\">referred to above</a>, now this Court is called upon to consider \nwhether the present case would come within the realm of the \nrarest of the rare or not.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">The instant case is one wherein accused Sonia, along \nwith accused Sanjiv [her husband] has not only put an end to \nthe lives of her step brother and his whole family, which \nincluded three tiny tots of 45 days, 2-1/2 years and 4 years, \nbut also her own father, mother and sister in a very diabolic \nmanner so as to deprive her father from giving the property to \nher step brother and his family. The fact that murders in \nquestion were committed in such a diabolic manner while the \nvictims were sleeping, without any provocation whatsoever \nfrom the victims&#x27; side indicates the cold-blooded and \npremeditated approach of the accused to cause death of the \nvictims. The brutality of the act is amplified by the grotesque \nand revolting manner in which the helpless victims have been \nmurdered which is indicative of the fact that the act was \ndiabolic of most superlative degree in conception and cruel in \nexecution and that both the accused persons are not \npossessed of the basic humanness and completely lack the \npsyche or mind set which can be amenable for any \nreformation. If this act is not revolting or dastardly, it is \nbeyond comprehension as to what other act can be so.  In view \nof these facts we are of the view that there would be failure of \njustice in case death sentence is not awarded in the present \ncase as the same undoubtedly falls within the category of \nrarest of rare cases and the High Court was not justified in \ncommuting death sentence into life imprisonment.\nIn the result Criminal Appeal No. 142 of 2006 filed by the \naccused persons is dismissed whereas Criminal Appeal No. \n895 of 2005 filed by private prosecutor and Criminal Appeal \nNo. 894 of 2005 filed by the State of Haryana are allowed, \norder passed by the High Court commuting death sentence \ninto life imprisonment is set aside and order of the trial court \nawarding death sentence is restored.\n</p>","numcites":37,"numcitedby":76,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":1384369,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"polygraph test","formInput":"polygraph%20test"},{"value":"circumstantial evidence","formInput":"circumstantial%20evidence"},{"value":"extra judicial confession","formInput":"extra%20judicial%20confession"},{"value":"death sentence","formInput":"death%20sentence"},{"value":"\"lie detection test\"","formInput":"%22lie%20detection%20test%22"},{"value":"suicide note","formInput":"suicide%20note"},{"value":"police custody ","formInput":"police%20custody%20"},{"value":"death penalty","formInput":"death%20penalty"},{"value":"formal arrest","formInput":"formal%20arrest"},{"value":"medical evidence","formInput":"medical%20evidence"},{"value":"life imprisonment","formInput":"life%20imprisonment"},{"value":"eschew","formInput":"eschew"},{"value":"confession before magistrate","formInput":"confession%20before%20magistrate"},{"value":"confession","formInput":"confession"},{"value":"\"polygraph\"","formInput":"%22polygraph%22"},{"value":"\" suicide note \"","formInput":"%22%20suicide%20note%20%22"},{"value":"section 164 of code of criminal procedure","formInput":"section%20164%20of%20code%20of%20criminal%20procedure"},{"value":"section 164 crpc","formInput":"section%20164%20crpc"},{"value":"confession of accused","formInput":"confession%20of%20accused"},{"value":"mitigating circumstances","formInput":"mitigating%20circumstances"}],"cats":[{"value":"evidence-by-refusal-of-production","formInput":"tag:evidence-by-refusal-of-production"},{"value":"inadmisibility-of-accused-confession-during-police-custody","formInput":"tag:inadmisibility-of-accused-confession-during-police-custody"},{"value":"confession-recording, recording-of-statement","formInput":"tag:confession-recording, recording-of-statement"},{"value":"murder","formInput":"tag:murder"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
