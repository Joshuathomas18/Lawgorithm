First Information Reports (FIRs) were registered for\n\ntransportation and sale of Gutka/Pan Masala for offences\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1777905/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 26</a> and <a href=\"/doc/934148/\" id=\"a_2\">30</a> of the Food and\n\nSafety Standards Act, 2006 (hereinafter referred to as the\n\n‘<a href=\"/doc/1766145/\" id=\"a_3\">FSS Act</a>’) and <a href=\"/doc/1432790/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 188</a>, <a href=\"/doc/471092/\" id=\"a_5\">272</a>, <a href=\"/doc/285163/\" id=\"a_6\">273</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1535430/\" id=\"a_7\">328</a> of the Indian\n\nPenal Code, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as the ‘<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">IPC</a>’). The\n\nRespondents in the above appeals filed Criminal Writ\n\nPetitions and Criminal Applications in the High Court of\n\nBombay for quashing the FIRs. The High Court quashed the\n\ncriminal proceedings against the Respondents and declared\n\nthat the Food Safety Officers can proceed against the\n\nRespondents under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1766145/\" id=\"a_9\">Chapter X of the FSS\n\nAct</a>. Aggrieved thereby, the State of Maharashtra is before\n\nus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                               2</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\f2.    The    High   Court    framed    two    questions     for\n\nconsideration. They are:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\"> i.   Whether the Food Safety Officers can lodge\n      complaints for offences punishable under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">IPC</a>?\nii.   Whether the acts complained amounted to any\n      offence punishable under the provisions of the\n      <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_11\">IPC</a>?\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">3.    A notification was issued on 18.07.2013 by the\n\nCommissioner, Food Safety and Drugs Administration,\n\nGovernment of Maharashtra under <a href=\"/doc/934148/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 30</a> of the FSS\n\nAct prohibiting manufacture, storage, distribution or sale of\n\ntobacco, Areca nut, which is either flavored, scented or\n\nmixed with any of the said addictives and whether going by\n\nthe name or form of gutka, pan masala, flavored, scented\n\ntobacco, flavored/scented supari, kharra or otherwise by\n\nwhatsoever name called, whether packaged or unpackaged\n\nand/or sold as one product, or though packaged as\n\nseparate products, sold or distributed in such a manner so\n\nas to easily facilitate mixing by the consumer.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.    Crimes were registered pursuant to complaints filed by\n\nthe Food Safety Officers for violation of the said notification\n\ndated 18.07.2013 against the Respondents who were either\n\ntransporting, stocking and/or selling the prohibited goods.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                               3</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">\f5.   The High Court examined <a href=\"/doc/74087/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 55</a> of the FSS Act\n\nwhich provides for penalty for non compliance of the\n\ndirections of the Food Safety Officers.        As per the said\n\nprovision the failure to comply with the requirements of the\n\nAct or the Rules or Regulations would result in a penalty\n\nwhich may extend to              Rs.2 lakhs.   The High Court\n\nobserved that non compliance of the notification dated\n\n18.07.2013 can be penalized only by imposing of fine\n\nmentioned in <a href=\"/doc/74087/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 55</a> and not otherwise.        No complaint\n\nfor offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">IPC</a> could have been preferred by the\n\nFood Safety Officer for violation of the prohibitory order\n\nissued by the Commissioner of Food Safety.                The\n\nallegations against the Respondents do not have the\n\ntendency to cause breach of law and order, according to\n\nthe High Court. The High Court found that the notification\n\nissued by the Commissioner dated 18.07.2013 is not an\n\norder contemplated under Chapter X of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_16\">IPC</a>. The High\n\nCourt was of the opinion that <a href=\"/doc/74087/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 55</a> of the FSS Act\n\nbeing a specific provision made in a special enactment,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1432790/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 188</a> of the IPC is not applicable.      The High Court\n\nconcluded on the first point that any violation of the\n\nprohibitory order can be dealt with only under <a href=\"/doc/74087/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 55</a> of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                             4</span>\n\fthe <a href=\"/doc/1766145/\" id=\"a_20\">FSS Act</a> and no other action can be initiated against the\n\nRespondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">6.   There is no dispute that <a href=\"/doc/74087/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 55</a> of the FSS Act\n\nprovides for penalty to be imposed for non compliance of\n\nthe requirements of the Act, Rules or Regulations or orders\n\nissued thereunder by the Food Safety Officer. But, we are\n\nafraid that we cannot agree with the conclusion of the High\n\nCourt that non compliance of the provisions of the Act,\n\nRules or Regulations or orders cannot be subject matter of\n\na prosecution under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_22\">IPC</a> unless expressly or impliedly\n\nbarred.   The High Court is clearly wrong in holding that\n\naction can be initiated against defaulters only under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/74087/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 55</a> of FSS Act or proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1795472/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 68</a> for\n\nadjudication have to be taken.               A further error was\n\ncommitted by the High Court in interpreting the scope of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1432790/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 188</a> of the IPC.    <a href=\"/doc/1432790/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 188</a> of the IPC does not\n\nonly cover breach of law and order, the disobedience of\n\nwhich is punishable. Section 188 is attracted even in cases\n\nwhere the act complained of causes or tends to cause\n\ndanger to human life, health or safety as well.          We do not\n\nagree with the High Court that the prohibitory order of the\n\nCommissioner,    Food     and       Safety    is   not   an   order\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                5</span>\n\fcontemplated under Chapter X of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_27\">IPC</a>.                We are also not\n\nin a position to accept the findings of the High Court that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/74087/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 55</a> of the FSS Act is the only provision which can be\n\nresorted to for non compliance of orders passed under the\n\nAct as it is a special enactment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">7.     There is no bar to a trial or conviction of an offender\n\nunder two different enactments, but the bar is only to the\n\npunishment of the offender twice for the offence. Where an\n\nact or an omission constitutes an offence under two\n\nenactments, the offender may be prosecuted and punished\n\nunder either or both enactments but shall not be liable to\n\nbe punished twice for the same offence. 1.                The same set\n\nof facts, in conceivable cases, can constitute offences\n\nunder two different laws.                    An act or an omission can\n\namount to and constitute an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_29\">IPC</a> and at\n\nthe same time, an offence under any other law. 2              The High\n\nCourt ought to have taken note of <a href=\"/doc/87754/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 26</a> of the General\n\nClauses Act, 1897 which reads as follows:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1871696\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1476698\" id=\"span_13\">“Provisions as to offences punishable under\n       two or more enactments – Where an act or\n       omission constitutes an offence under two or more\n       enactments, then the offender shall be liable to be\n       prosecuted and punished under either or any of\n1 <a href=\"/doc/1476698/\" id=\"a_31\">T.S.

In Hat Singh’s3 case this Court discussed the doctrine\n\nof double jeopardy and <a href=\"/doc/87754/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 26</a> of the General Clauses\n\nAct to observe that prosecution under two different Acts is\n\npermissible if the ingredients of the provisions are satisfied\n\non the same facts. While considering a dispute about the\n\nprosecution of the Respondent therein for offences under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/198881428/\" id=\"a_34\">Mines and Minerals (Development and Regulation) Act</a>\n\n1957 and <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_35\">Indian Penal Code</a>, this Court in <a href=\"/doc/76417350/\" id=\"a_36\">State (NCT of\n\nDelhi) v.

A\n\nperusal of the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1766145/\" id=\"a_37\">FSS Act</a> would make it clear\n\nthat there is no bar for prosecution under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_38\">IPC</a> merely\n\nbecause the provisions in the <a href=\"/doc/1766145/\" id=\"a_39\">FSS Act</a> prescribe penalties.\n\nWe, therefore, set aside the finding of the High Court on the\n\nfirst point.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"170445\" id=\"span_16\">9.
