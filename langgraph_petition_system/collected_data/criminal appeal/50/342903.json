Sanction\t for\nprosecution  of the accused was given by a Deputy  Secretary\non behalf of the Central Government.  The accused were tried\nby  a Special judge.  The main evidence led was that of\t one\nL,  a  security\t officer., who had been asked  to  join\t the\nconspiracy  and\t who had joined it with a view to  have\t the\noffenders apprehended.\tThe Special judge convicted all\t the\naccused\t persons.   On appeal the High Court  confirmed\t the\nconviction  of the appellant and one other accused now\tdead\nand  acquitted the other four accused persons  holding\tthat\nthe  evidence of L was corroborated in material\t particulars\nin respect of the appellant and one other accused only.\t The\nappellant contended:- (i) that the appellant who was subject\nto  the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_4\">Army Act</a> could only be tried by a Court Martial\t and\nthe Special judge had no jurisdiction to try him, (ii)\tthat\nthe  sanction to prosecute was void as it was not  expressed\nto be\n196\nmade   in  the\tname  of  the  President,  (iii)  that\t the\ninvestigation by the Inspector of Police, was illegal,\t(iv)\nthat  there could be no legal charge of\t conspiracy  between\naccused\t who were public servants and accused who were\tnot,\nand  (v)  that\tL  was a  wholly  unreliable  witness  whose\ntestimony  ought  to  have  been  rejected  totally  and  no\nquestion of its corroboration arose.\nHeld,  that  the Special judge had jurisdiction to  try\t the\nappellant  for the offences charged.  <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_5\">The Army Act</a> does\t not\nbar  the jurisdiction of criminal courts in respect of\tacts\nor omissions which are punishable under the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_6\">Army Act</a> as well\nas under any other law in force.

The  offences\nfor   which  the  appellant  was  convicted  were   offences\nspecified  in  s.  6(1) and were exclusively  triable  by  a\nSpecial judge.\nHeld, further, that the sanction for the prosecution of\t the\nappellant was a good and valid sanction.  <a href=\"/doc/990669/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 77</a> of\t the\nConstitution  which provides that all orders of the  Central\nGovernment  shall  be  expressed to be in the  name  of\t the\nPresident  is  only directory and not mandatory.

Though all the accused were not liable for\t the\nindividual offences, they were all guilty of the offence  of\nconspiracy to do illegal acts.\nHeld, further, that the evidence of L was reliable and\tthat\nit  was corroborated in material particulars so far  as\t the\nappellant was concerned.  Though L was not an accomplice, he\nwas  an interested witness and required corroboration.\t The\nevidence  of  an approver and the  corroborating  pieces  of\nevidence could not be treated in two different compartments;\nbut had to be considered together.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nSUBBA  RAO, J.-These two appeals-one filed by accused No.  1\nby  certificate\t and  the  other  filed\t by  the  State\t  of\nMaharashtra  by\t special leave-against the judgment  of\t the\nHigh Court of Bombay confirming the conviction and  sentence\nof  accused  No.  1 and setting aside  the  convictions\t and\nsentences of accused Nos. 2 and 3.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">The  prosecution  case may be briefly stated.  There  was  a\ndepot called the Dehu Vehicle Depot in which military stores\nwere  kept.  In the year 1944 Col.  Rao, the Chief  Ordnance\nOfficer,  was  in  charge of the Depot;\t Col.\tSindhi,\t the\nStation\t Commandant,  and  Brig.   Wilson,  the\t  Brigadier,\nOrdnance,  Southern  Command, were  his\t superior  officers.\nAccused\t No. 1, Major Barsay, was second in command  in\t the\nDepot  and was in charge of stores section; he was  subordi-\nnate  to Col.  Rao.  Major Nag, another subordinate to\tCol.\nRao, was in charge of the administration of the Depot.\t One\nCapt.\tPratap Singh was the Security Officer in the  Depot;\nbut, during the period in question, one Lawrence was  acting\nas  the\t Security Officer in place of Capt.   Pratap  Singh.\nKochhar,  accused No. 2, who was on leave from\tOctober\t 25,\n1954,  was recalled to duty by accused No. 1 and was put  in\ncharge\tof kit stores in the Depot.  Avatar  singh,  accused\nNo.  3,\t who  was  working  in\tthe  Unfit  Sub\t Park,\t was\ntransferred  to the Kit Stores by accused No. 1\t during\t the\nabsence on leave of Col.  Rao.\tAccused No. 4, Saighal,\t was\nan Ex-Col. and was at one time the Station Commandant of the\nDepot; after retirement he had been staying in a bungalow at\na  short  distance from mile No. 92/7  on  the\tPoona-Bombay\nRoad.  Accused No. 5, Ramchand Gangwani, was a refugee\tfrom\nSind  and he was running a hotel at Lonnavala.\tAccused\t No.\n6, Devichand, and one\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">199</span>\nKhemchand,  who\t is absconding, are sons of accused  No.  5.\nAccused\t Nos.  4  and  5 were friends  and  they  were\talso\npartners along with one Bhagwan Parshuram of Bombay in\t&quot;The\nBombay\tLonavala  Disposal  Syndicate&quot;.\t  There\t were  large\nconsignments of Kits in Shed No. 48 of Kit Stores which were\nunitemized  and unaccounted for in the books of\t the  Depot.\nThe accused entered into a conspiracy to smuggle out some of\nthe said stores and to make an illegal gain by selling\tthem\nat Bombay through accused No. 4.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">The brain behind the conspiracy was accused No. 1. The\tplan\nchalked out to implement the object of the conspiracy may be\nbriefly stated.\t Col.  Rao was to proceed on leave  sometime\nin  December  1954  and\t Maj.  Barsay,\tbeing  the  next  in\ncommand,  was  naturally to succeed him\t as  Chief  Ordnance\nOfficer\t of  the Depot during the absence on leave  of\tCol.\nRao.  The smuggling of the goods out of the Depot was there-\nfore  arranged\tto take place during the  period  when\tMaj.\nBarsay\twas  acting  as the Chief Ordnance  Officer  of\t the\nDepot.\t Col.\tRao went on leave from\tDecember  11,  1954.\nKochhar,  the second accused, who was in charge of the\tFit-\nPark, proceeded on two months&#x27; leave of absence with  effect\nfrom October 25, 1954, but he was recalled by accused No.  1\nand  posted as officer in charge of Kit Stores\ton  November\n25,  1954.  Accused No. 3, Avatarsingh, was working  in\t the\nUnfit Sub Park, and he too was shifted from there to the Kit\nStores\ton or about November 22, 1954.\tThese two,  postings\nwere made by accused No. 1 without the consent or  knowledge\nof  Col.   Rao when he had gone to Delhi on  some  temporary\nduty  for  ten days from November 20, 1954 to  November\t 30,\n1954.\tOn the night of December 1, 1954, there was a  theft\nof various articles in the Unfit Park of the Depot.  Accused\nNo.  1\tcalled\tin Lawrence, the  acting  Security  Officer,\nostensibly to discuss with him certain matters regarding the\ntheft.\tDuring the course of the conversation accused No.  1\nsuggested  to Lawrence that valuable stores in Shed  No.  48\nmight  be smuggled out and the large amounts expected to  be\nrealized  from\ttheir  sale  might  be\tshared\tbetween\t the\nconspirators, including\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">200</span>\nLawrence.  Presumably to put him in a suitable frame of mind\nto  accept the suggestion to become a conspirator,  he\talso\nhinted\tto  Lawrence  that  Col.   Rao\tsuspected  that\t  he\n(Lawrence) had a hand in the theft.  The scheme outlined  by\naccused\t No.  1 was confirmed by accused No. 2\ta  few\tdays\nlater.\t According to the plan chalked out by Maj.   Barsay,\nhe  was\t to appoint a board of officers for  itemization  of\n&quot;Specialist  Boxed Kits&quot; in Shed No. 17 and once  the  board\nstarted functioning there would be shuttle of trucks  moving\nfrom  Shed No. 48 to Shed No. 17 and vice versa\t and  during\nthe  movements\tof those trucks two or three  trucks  loaded\nwith  valuable stores were to be moved out through the\tmain\ngate of the Depot on the pretext of being back-loaded to the\nReturn\tStores Sub-Depot.  He was also to take Col.  Rao  to\nShed No. 48 and explain to him that the boxes contained very\nfew  items so that he too, on his return from  leave,  would\nnot be surprised at the final result of the itemization.  It\nwas  also  agreed that the scheme should be  pushed  through\ntentatively  on December 16, 17 and 18, 1954.  But, for\t one\nreason or other, it could not be pushed through during those\ndays, as Capt.\tKapoor was frequently visiting the scene  of\nitemization.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">On December 18, 1954, a meeting took place at Maj.  Barsay&#x27;s\nbungalow and accused Nos.  1 to 4 and Lawrence attended that\nmeeting.   At  that meeting the details of working  out\t the\nplan to be carried out on December 20, 1954, were finalized.\nKochhar\t reported  to the conspirators that he\thad  briefed\nJamadar\t Kundanlal,  and  Lawrence told them  that,  as\t per\nKochhar&#x27;s  suggestion,\the  had\t already  detailed   Jamadar\nKundanlal on day duty at the main gate during the next week.\nMaj.   Barsay  agreed  to get a\t driver\t of  his  confidence\ndetailed  on  one of the trucks to be allotted\tto  the\t Kit\nStores\tand  he\t offered to give orders to  Kochhar  on\t the\nmorning\t of  December 20, 1954, in the presence of  all,  to\ntransfer the itemized kits to Shed No. 26 ostensibly for the\npurpose of conditioning and preservation.  That would enable\naccused\t No. 3, Avatar Singh, to load the stores  from\tShed\nNo.  17.   The first trip was to be of\tordinary  stores  in\nwhich the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\t\t\t    201</span>\nconspirators were not interested and the second trip was  to\nbe  of valuable stores which were to be smuggled out of\t the\ngate.  Maj.  Barsay also undertook to call Maj.\t Nag to\t his\noffice on December 20, 1954 and issue orders in the presence\nof  Maj.   Nag\tto Lawrence to go  to  Dehu  Ordnance  Depot\n(D.O.D.)  and get the fire hoses which were sent  there\t for\nrepairs.   Kochhar  agreed  to prepare a  bogus\t voucher  on\nMonday\t(December 20, 1954) morning, and Lawrence  undertook\nto  provide  a\tbogus gate-pass.  Accused  No.\t4,  Saighal,\nagreed\tto keep a lorry and some laborers present  near\t his\nbungalow for transshipping the stores.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">On  the evening of December 19, 1954, Lawrence went  to\t the\nhouse  of Saighal and the latter showed him the\t spot  where\nthe  stores  were  to be  transshipped.\t  Thereafter,  after\ntaking his dinner, Lawrence went to the Depot at 9 p.m.\t The\nOrderly\t Officer  at the Depot,\t one  Shrinivasan,  informed\nLawrence  that\tJamadar Kundanlal, who was to have  been  on\nduty at the main gate on December 20, 1954, was sick and had\ntaken  3 days&#x27; leave of absence on medical grounds and\tthat\nMaj.   Barsay  had  sent a chit to him asking  him  to\tsend\nLawrence to the bungalow of Maj.  Barsay.  Lawrence went  to\nthe  bungalow of Maj.  Barsay, but could not meet  him;\t and\nthen Lawrence went to the residence of Jamadar Kundanlal and\ntried to persuade him to attend to his duty at the main gate\non December 20, 1954.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">On December 20, 1954, at about 9.15 a.m. Maj.  Barsay called\nHavaldar  Pillay to his office and asked him to allot a\t new\nvehicle\t to  the Kit Stores and to detail driver  Ramban  on\nthat vehicle.  Havaldar Pillay did accordingly.\t At about 10\na.m.,  Maj.   Barsay called Maj.  Nag and  Lawrence  to\t his\noffice\tand, in the presence of Maj.  Nag, he issued  orders\nto Lawrence to go to Dehu Ordnance Depot (D.O.D.) personally\nand  get  the fire hoses.  After Maj.  Nag left\t the  place,\nLawrence  told\tMaj.   Barsay  that  Jamadar  Kundanlal\t had\nreported  himself to be sick and had taken leave of  absence\nand  that  one\tGodse was at the main  gate.   Maj.   Barsay\nsuggested to Lawrence that 26\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">202</span>\nJamadar\t Jogendrasingh may be put at the main gate in  place\nof Godse, and he informed him that he had fixed upon  Ramban\nas the driver of the vehicle in which the stores were to  be\nsmuggled  out.\tAt about 11 a.m. Lawrence met  Maj.   Barsay\nand  Kochhar near, Shed No. 48 and was told by Maj.   Barsay\nthat  the  scheme  was to  proceed  according  to  schedule.\nKochhar\t and  Lawrence\tthen  went  to\tShed  No.  17  where\nAvatarsingh,  accused  No.  3, was  present.   Kochhar\ttold\nAvatarsingh  that he had not prepared any voucher as it\t was\nnot  necessary.\t Lawrence had brought an old gate-pass\twith\nhim  and he handed over the same to Avatarsingh.  Truck\t No.\nD. D. 5963 was, in the first instance, loaded with  ordinary\nstores\tand  was  sent to Shed No. 26.\t In  the  meanwhile,\nLawrence  went to the Depot and asked Godse to take over  at\nthe Unfit Sub Park gate and he ordered Jamadar Jogendrasingh\nto  take  over\tfrom Godse at the  main\t gate.\t As  Jamadar\nJogendrasingh refused to accept the gate-pass to be produced\nby  the\t driver and pass out the vehicle without  making  an\nentry  regarding  the  same  in the  &quot;Vehicles\tIn  and\t Out\nRegister&quot;, Lawrence gave him a written order to that  effect\nwith  instructions  not to show or hand\t over  that  written\norder  to  anybody except himself on his return or  to\tMaj.\nNag.  At about 1 p.m. Maj.  Barsay told Lawrence that he had\nbecome apprehensive of the scheme succeeding, as he had seen\nthe  Station Commandant&#x27;s car near the Barrack\tOffice\tand,\ntherefore, he told him not to take out the vehicle till that\ncar  had gone out.  Lawrence agreed and went to Shed No.  17\nwhere Avatarsingh was present, and Avatarsingh got the truck\nloaded and handed over the bogus gate-pass and the duty-slip\nof the vehicle to Ramban, and he also asked Lawrence to\t get\ninto the truck there itself instead of near the main gate as\nper  the  plan.\t  After\t Lawrence got  into  the  truck,  it\nproceeded  towards the main gate at about 1.40 p.m.  At\t the\nmain gate, Ramban gave the duty-slip of the vehicle and also\nthe bogus gate-pass to Jamadar Jogendrasingh and the  latter\ntold  Lawrence that Maj.  Barsay had left a message for\t him\n&quot;not to do it on that day&quot;.  Lawrence,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\t\t\t    203</span>\nignoring  the said directions, took the vehicle out  of\t the\ngate.\tAt a spot near Talegaon there was a  civilian  lorry\nbearing\t No. BYL 3289 kept ready by accused Nos. 4, 5 and  6\nfor transhipping the stores, and to that place the truck was\ndriven.\t  The  two  lorries were parked back  to  back,\t and\naccused No. 6. and the absconding accused Khemchand and\t two\nothers\tstarted\t transhipping the stores from  the  military\nlorry  to  the civilian lorry.\tAt that\t stage,\t the  police\nofficers  appeared  at\tthe  scene  and\t prevented   further\nfulfilment of the plan of the accused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">It  is\ta  further case of  the\t prosecution  that  Lawrence\nostensibly  joined  the conspiracy with a view to  bring  to\nbook  the culprits and was informing the  superior  officers\nand  the police orally and in writing from time to  time  as\nand when the important events were taking\nplace.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">As  some argument was made on the basis of the\tcharges,  it\nwould be convenient at this stage to read the charges framed\nby the Special Judge, Poona.

Shortly stated,\nthe defence was that all the accused were innocent and\tthat\nit  was Lawrence that &quot;abducted&quot; the truck with the  stores,\nmade false statements to the superior officers from time  to\ntime giving concocted versions to fit in with the theory  of\nconspiracy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">The Special Judge, on a consideration of the evidence,\theld\nthat all the charges were made out against the accused.\t  He\nrejected  the technical objections raised in regard  to\t the\nframing\t of the charges, the validity of  the  investigation\nmade by the investigating officer and the sanction given  by\nthe  Central Government for the prosecution of the  accused,\nand  came  to the conclusion that prima facie there  was  no\ngood  ground  to discard the evidence of  Lawrence,  but  he\nplaced\tthe  said  evidence in the  category  of  interested\nevidence  and  required\t independent  corroboration   before\nacceptance.   In  the words of the  learned  Special  Judge,\n&quot;Shri Lawrence&#x27;s evidence can,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">206</span>\ntherefore,  be\taccepted  and relied upon,  only  if  it  is\ncorroborated by other independent evidence and circumstances\nin  the\t case.&quot; He found ample\tevidence  and  circumstances\ncorroborating  the evidence of Lawrence.

The\tHigh\nCourt  also rejected all the technical objections raised  at\nthe  instance  of the appellant-accused in  regard  to\tsome\nparts of 2nd, 3rd and 4th charges.  In regard to the 2nd and\n3rd head sub-charges, tile High Court accepted the plea that\naccused\t Nos.  4, 5 and 6 could not be charged\twith  having\ncommitted an offence under<a href=\"/doc/1796049/\" id=\"a_28\"> s. 5(1)(c)</a> and<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_29\"> s. 5(1)(d)</a> of\t the\nPrevention  of\tCorruption  Act, as  they  were\t not  public\nservants;  but they held that it would be proper to frame  a\ncharge\tagainst them under<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_30\"> s. 109</a> of the Indian\t Penal\tCode\nfor having abetted the commission of the offence of criminal\nmisconduct  under  s. 5(1)(c) and (d) of the  <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_31\">Prevention  of\nCorruption  Act</a>, committed by accused Nos.  1 to 3.  As\t the\nHigh  Court  held  that\t they were  not\t prejudiced  by\t the\nirregularity  of  the charge, it altered the charge  to\t one\nunder<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_32\"> s. 109</a> of the Indian Penal Code, read with<a href=\"/doc/1796049/\" id=\"a_33\"> s.  5(1)(c)</a>\nand (d) of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_34\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>.  As regards the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\t\t\t    207</span>\nlast head of the charge, it held that all the accused  could\nnot be charged with having committed an offence under<a href=\"/doc/436339/\" id=\"a_35\"> s. 381</a>\nof the Indian Penal Code and that the charge under<a href=\"/doc/812083/\" id=\"a_36\"> s. 411</a> of\nthe  Indian Penal Code would also appear to be\timproper  so\nfar as accused Nos.  1 to 3 were concerned; but it held that\nso far as accused Nos. 4, 5 and 6 were concerned, the charge\nunder  s. 411, read with<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_37\"> s. 34</a>, Indian Penal Code, would  be\nquite proper.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">Before\tthe High Court, learned counsel appearing on  behalf\nof the accused and the special counsel, Mr. Amin,  appearing\non  behalf  of\tthe State, asked the  Court  to\t proceed  to\nexamine the evidence of Lawrence on the basis that he was  a\ndecoy  and a trap witness.  The High Court agreed  with\t the\nlearned\t Special Judge that the evidence of Lawrence  would,\nhave  to be treated on par with that of a trap\twitness\t and\nthat it would be inadvisable to rely upon the said  evidence\nwithout independent corroboration.  It also pointed out that\nthe corroboration required was not a corroboration of  every\nparticular  in\trespect\t of  which  the\t accomplice  or\t the\napprover  gave his evidence, but the corroboration  must  be\nsuch  as to make the court believe that the evidence of\t the\naccomplice  was a truthful one and that it would be safe  to\nact upon that evidence.\t Finally the High Court premised its\ndiscussion of the evidence in the following words:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\t      &quot;In  our\topinion, all these  decisions  would\n\t      clearly establish that it would not be safe to\n\t      rely  on\tthe  evidence  of  Lawrence  who  is\n\t      admittedly  a decoy or trap  witness,  without\n\t      his   testimony\tbeing\tcorroborated\tfrom\n\t      independent sources.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">Then  the  learned Judges of the High Court  considered\t the\nevidence  of Lawrence minutely, discarded some parts of\t the\nevidence  which were discrepant or inconsistent\t with  other\nproved\tfacts  and accepted the broad  story  of  conspiracy\ngiven  by him as true to the extent it was  corroborated  by\nother  unimpeachable pieces of evidence\t and  circumstances.\nAfter elaborately considering the evidence of Lawrence,\t the\nlearned Judges of the High Court came to the following\tcon-\nclusion:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">208</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\t      &quot;We,  therefore, accept  Lawrence&#x27;s  evidence,\n\t      find  that his story is probable and true\t and\n\t      we  also find that the evidence on the  record\n\t      justified the finding of the trial Court\tthat\n\t      there  was  a  conspiracy as  alleged  by\t the\n\t      prosecution  to smuggle goods out of the\tDehu\n\t      Vehicles Depot.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">Then the learned Judges considered the question as to  which\nof  the\t accused took part in the  conspiracy.\t As  regards\naccused\t No. 1, they came to the conclusion that  there\t was\ncogent\tevidence to implicate him in the conspiracy, and  in\nthat  view,  they confirmed the finding of the\ttrial  court\nthat  he was a party to the conspiracy to  smuggle  military\ngoods out of the Depot.\t As regards accused No. 2, they held\nthat  the evidence was not sufficient to establish  that  he\nwas a member of the alleged conspiracy and that, as he could\nnot  be held to be a member of the conspiracy, he could\t not\nalso be held to be guilty of committing criminal  misconduct\nunder  s.  5(1)(c) and (d) of the <a href=\"/doc/33237157/\" id=\"a_38\">Prevention  of  Corruption\nAct,  1947</a>.   As  regards accused No. 3, they  were  of\t the\nopinion that the case against him was not established beyond\nreasonable doubt and that he could not be held to be  guilty\nof  criminal conspiracy as well as criminal misconduct.\t  As\nregards\t accused  No. 4, they accepted the  finding  of\t the\nlearned\t Special Judge, as independent\tacceptable  evidence\ncorroborated  the  evidence of Lawrence in respect  of\tthis\naccused.   So  far as accused Nos. 5 and 6  were  concerned,\nthey  found the evidence to be very weak and  therefore\t set\naside  the convictions and sentences passed against them.\nIn the result, they confirmed the convictions and  sentences\nof  accused  Nos.  1 and 4, and set aside those\t of  accused\nNos. 2, 3, 5 and 6.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">It  appears  that accused No. 4 died after  the\t appeal\t was\ndisposed  of  by the High Court.  Accused  No.\t1  preferred\nCriminal  Appeal  No. 2 of 1958 against his  conviction\t and\nsentence  passed by the High Court and the  State  preferred\nCriminal  Appeal No. 81 of 1960 challenging the\t correctness\nof the order of acquittal made in respect of accused Nos.  2\nand 3.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">We shall first take the appeal filed by accused No. 1.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\t\t\t    209</span>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">Learned\t counsel for the appellant raised before us all\t the\ntechnical  points which he unsuccessfully raised before\t the\nSpecial\t Judge\tas well as before the High  Court.   At\t the\noutset\twe  shall  deal with  the  said\t contentions  before\nconsidering  the  arguments advanced on the  merits  of\t the\ncase.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">The first contention of learned counsel for the appellant is\nthat  the Special Judge, Poona, had no jurisdiction to\ttake\ncognizance  of\tthe  offences with which  the  accused\twere\ncharged and that they should have been tried only by a court\nmartial under the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_39\">Army Act</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">The  argument  of learned counsel for the appellant  may  be\nbriefly stated thus: <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_40\">The Army Act, 1950</a> (46 of 1950) created\nnew  offences.\t<a href=\"/doc/1551960/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 52</a> of the said Act created  offences\nwith  which  accused in the present case were  charged,\t and\nprovided  a new machinery, namely, a court martial,  to\t try\npersons\t  committing  the  said\t offences.    Therefore\t  by\nnecessary  implication\tthe trial of the said  offences\t was\nexcluded from the jurisdiction of ordinary criminal  courts.\nThis argument was sought to be reinforced by the  provisions\nof  s.\t69  of the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_42\">Army Act</a> whereunder, it was\tsaid,  by  a\nfiction,  offences  committed by army personnel\t which\twere\ntriable by ordinary courts were to be deemed to be  offences\ncommitted  against  the said Act.  That\t difference  between\noffences against the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_43\">Army Act</a> and the offences deemed to  be\ncommitted against the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_44\">Army Act</a>, the argument proceeded,\t was\nan  unfailing  clue for the true construction  of  the\tpro-\nvisions of the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_45\">Army Act</a> in that the offences under the first\ncategory  were exclusively triable by court martial and\t the\noffences; of the latter category were subject to  concurrent\njurisdiction  of  two courts.  The logical  conclusion\tfrom\nthis premises, it was said, was that the provisions designed\nto  resolve  conflict of jurisdiction related  only  to\t the\nsecond\tcategory  of  offences.\t  Assuming  that  the\tsaid\ncontention was wrong, it was argued, s. 126 of the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_46\">Army\t Act</a>\nis peremptory in its language, namely, that a criminal court\nshall not have jurisdiction to try an offence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\t\t   27</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">210</span>\ndefined under the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_47\">Army Act</a>, unless the conditions laid\tdown\ntherein\t were  strictly\t complied  with,  that\tis,   unless\nrequisite notice is given to the officer referred\nto in<a href=\"/doc/440590/\" id=\"a_48\"> s. 125</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">To   appreciate\t the  said  argument  it  is  necessary\t  to\nscrutinize  the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_49\">Army Act</a> in  some  detail.\n<a href=\"/doc/397677/\" id=\"a_50\">Section\t 2</a>  describes  the  different  categories  of\tarmy\npersonnel  who are subject to the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_51\">Army Act</a>.   <a href=\"/doc/1741034/\" id=\"a_52\">Section  3(ii)</a>\ndefines &quot;civil offence&quot; to mean &quot;an offence which is triable\nby  a criminal court&quot;; a. 3(vii) defines &quot;court-martial&quot;  to\nmean  &quot;a  court-martial\t held under this  Act&quot;;\t s.  3(viii)\ndefines\t &quot;criminal  court&quot;  to mean  &quot;a\t court\tof  ordinary\ncriminal justice in any part of India, other than the  State\nof Jammu and Kashmir&quot;; s. 3(xvii) defines &quot;offence&quot; to\tmean\n&quot;any act or omission punishable under this Act and  includes\na civil offence&quot;; and<a href=\"/doc/171990146/\" id=\"a_53\"> s. 3(xxv)</a> declares that &quot;all words and\nexpressions used but not defined in this Act and defined  in\nthe  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_54\">Indian Penal Code</a> shall be deemed to have the  meanings\nassigned  to them in that Code.&quot; Chapter VI is comprised  of<a href=\"/doc/873394/\" id=\"a_55\">\nss. 34</a> to <a href=\"/doc/226490/\" id=\"a_56\">70</a>.

Where an offence is\t for\nthe  first  time  created by the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_62\">Army  Act</a>,  such  as  those\ncreated by<a href=\"/doc/873394/\" id=\"a_63\"> ss. 34</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1640944/\" id=\"a_64\">35</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1606949/\" id=\"a_65\">36</a>, <a href=\"/doc/91372/\" id=\"a_66\">37</a> etc., it would be\t exclusively\ntriable by a courtmartial; but where a civil offence is also\nan  offence under the Act or deemed to be an  offence  under\nthe Act, both an ordinary criminal court as well as a court-\nmartial would have jurisdiction to try the person committing\nthe  offence.  Such a situation is visualized  and  provided\nfor by as. 125 and 126 of the Act.

Such a situation can arise  in  a\ncase  of an act or omission punishable both under  the\t<a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_70\">Army\nAct</a>.  as  well as under any law in force in India.   It\t may\nalso arise in the case of an offence deemed to be an offence\nunder the Act.\tUnder the scheme of the said two provisions,\nin the first instance,, it is left to the discretion of\t the\nofficer mentioned in<a href=\"/doc/440590/\" id=\"a_71\"> s. 125</a> to decide before which court the\nproceedings shall be instituted, and, if the officer decides\nthat  they should be instituted before a court-martial,\t the\naccused person is to be detained in military custody; but if\na  criminal court is of opinion that the said offence  shall\nbe  tried before itself, he may issue the  requisite  notice\nunder  s.  126 either to deliver over the  offender  to\t the\nnearest magistrate or to postpone the proceedings pending  a\nreference to the Central Government.  On receipt of the said\nrequisition,  the  officer  may\t either\t deliver  over\t the\noffender  to the said court or refer the question of  proper\ncourt for the determination of the Central Government  whose\norder  shall  be  final.   These  two  sections\t provide   a\nsatisfactory   machinery   to  resolve\t the   conflict\t  of\njurisdiction,  having  regard  to  the\texigencies  of\t the\nsituation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">What is more, s. 127 of the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_72\">Army Act</a> provides for successive\ntrials by court-martial and by criminal court in respect  of\nthe  same  offence.  Under sub-s. (1) of  that\tsection,  &quot;A\nperson convicted or acquitted by a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\t\t\t    213</span>\ncourt-martial may, with the previous sanction of the Central\nGovernment, be tried again by a criminal court for the\tsame\noffence,  or  on  the same facts.&quot; But\tsub-s.\t(2)  thereof\nimposes\t a  limitation in the matters  of  punishment;\tfor,\nunder  that  sub-section,  the\tcriminal  court\t shall,\t  in\nawarding  punishment,  have  regard to\tthe  punishment\t the\noffender may already have undergone for the said offence.\nThe  scheme  of\t the Act, therefore,  is  self-evident.\t  It\napplies to offences committed by army personnel described in<a href=\"/doc/397677/\" id=\"a_73\">\ns.  2</a>  of the Act; it creates new  offences  with  specified\npunishments,  imposes  higher  punishments  to\tpre-existing\noffences,  and\tenables civil offences by a  fiction  to  be\ntreated\t  as   offences\t under\tthe  Act;  it\tprovides   a\nsatisfactory   machinery  for  resolving  the  conflict\t  of\njurisdiction.\tFurther\t it  enables,  subject\tto   certain\nconditions,  an\t accused to be tried  successively  both  by\ncourt-martial  and  by\ta  criminal  court.   It  does\t not\nexpressly bar the jurisdiction of criminal courts in respect\nof  acts or omissions punishable under the Act, if they\t are\nalso  punishable under any other law in force in India;\t nor\nis  it\tpossible  to  infer  any  prohibition  by  necessary\nimplication.   <a href=\"/doc/440590/\" id=\"a_74\">Sections\t 125</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1701462/\" id=\"a_75\">126</a> and 127 exclude  any\tsuch\ninference,  for they in express terms provide not  only\t for\nresolving conflict of jurisdiction between a criminal  court\nand  a court-martial in respect of a same offence, but\talso\nprovide\t for successive trials of an accused in\t respect  of\nthe same offence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">Now  let  us apply this legal position to the facts  of\t the\ncase.  Under<a href=\"/doc/1551960/\" id=\"a_76\"> s. 52</a> of the Act, any person subject to the Act\nwho commits theft of any property belonging to Government or\nto   any  military,  naval  or\tair  force  mess,  band\t  or\ninstitution, or to any person subject to military, naval  or\nair force law, or dishonestly misappropriates or converts to\nhis own use any such property, or commits criminal breach of\ntrust  in  respect of any such property, or does  any  other\nthing  with intent to defraud, or to cause wrongful gain  to\none  person  or wrongful loss to another  person  shall,  on\nconviction  by\tcourt-martial,\tbe  liable  to\tsuffer\t im-\nprisonment for a term which may extend to ten years\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">214</span>\nor such less punishment as is in the act mentioned.  <a href=\"/doc/397677/\" id=\"a_77\">Section\n2  (xxv)</a>  says that all words and expressions used  but\t not\ndefined in the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_78\">Army Act</a> and defined in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_79\">Indian Penal Code</a>\nshall  be deemed to have the  meanings assigned to  them  in\nthat  Code.  The section does not create new  offences,\t but\nprescribes higher punishments if the said offences are tried\nby  a  court-martial.  The appellant and the  other  accused\nwere  charged in the present case, among others, for  having\nbeen  parties  to a criminal conspiracy\t to  dishonestly  or\nfraudulently  misappropriate or otherwise convert  to  their\nown  use  the military stores and also\tfor  dishonestly  or\nfraudulently  misappropriating\tthe  same.   The  said\tacts\nconstitute  offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_80\">Indian Penal Code</a>  and  under\nthe  <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_81\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>.  They are  also  offences\nunder  s.  52  of  the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_82\">Army  Act</a>.   Though  the\t offence  of\nconspiracy does not fall under<a href=\"/doc/1551960/\" id=\"a_83\"> s. 52</a> of the Act, it, being a\ncivil offence, shall be deemed to be an offence against\t the\nAct by the. force of<a href=\"/doc/234068/\" id=\"a_84\"> s. 69</a> of the Act.\tWith the result that\nthe offences are triable both by an ordinary criminal  court\nhaving\tjurisdiction to try the said offences and  a  court-\nmartial.   To such a situation<a href=\"/doc/440590/\" id=\"a_85\"> ss. 125</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1701462/\" id=\"a_86\">126</a>\tare  clearly\nintended to apply.  But the designated officer in<a href=\"/doc/440590/\" id=\"a_87\"> s. 125</a> has\nnot chosen to exercise his discretion to decide before which\ncourt  the proceedings shall be instituted.  As he  has\t not\nexercised  the\tdiscretion,  there is no  occasion  for\t the\ncriminal  court\t to invoke the provisions of<a href=\"/doc/1701462/\" id=\"a_88\"> s. 126</a>  of\t the\nAct,  for  the second part of<a href=\"/doc/542147/\" id=\"a_89\"> s. 126(1)</a>, which\tenables\t the\ncriminal  court to issue a notice to the officer  designated\nin  s.\t125 of the Act to deliver over the offender  to\t the\nnearest magistrate or to postpone the proceedings pending  a\nreference to the Central Government, indicates that the said\nsubsection  presuppose,%  that the  designated\tofficer\t has\ndecided\t that the proceedings shall be instituted  before  a\ncourt-martial and directed that the accused person shall  be\ndetained  in  military\tcustody.  If no\t such  decision\t was\narrived\t at, the <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_90\">Army Act</a> could not obviously be in the\t way\nof a criminal court exercising its ordinary jurisdiction  in\nthe manner provided by law.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">215</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">The correct approach to the problem may be stated thus:\t The\nappellant  and\tthe other accused  have\t committed  offences\nunder the Indian Penal Code and the Prevention of Corruption\nAct.  By reason of<a href=\"/doc/341214/\" id=\"a_91\"> s. 7</a> of the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act,\n1952,  the  said  offences are triable by  a  special  judge\nappointed  under that Act.  The special judge  so  appointed\nwould have jurisdiction to try the said offences unless\t the\n<a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_92\">Army  Act</a> expressly, or by necessary  implication,  excluded\nthe offences alleged to have been committed by the appellant\nand  others  from  the\tjurisdiction  of  that\tcourt.\t The\naforesaid  discussion  of  the provisions of  the  <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_93\">Army\t Act</a>\nindicates that there is not only no such exclusion but\talso\nthat  there  is\t clear and  unambiguous\t indication  to\t the\ncontrary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_39\">An argument advanced by learned counsel for the appellant in\nthis context may conveniently be noticed at this stage.\t The\nsecond\tbranch\tof the argument of learned counsel  for\t the\nappellant  under this head is based upon<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_94\"> s. 549</a> of the\tCode\nof  Criminal  Procedure.  Under that section,  &quot;The  Central\nGovernment may make rules, consistent with this <a href=\"/doc/165229/\" id=\"a_95\">Code and the\nArmy  Act</a>...............  as to the cases in  which  persons\nsubject\t to military, naval or air-force law shall be  tried\nby  a  court  to  which this  Code  applies,  or  by  Court-\nmartial ................ . The Central Government made rules\nin exercise of the power conferred on it under this section.\nNo rule was made prescribing that the offences with which we\nare  now concerned shall be tried only by  a  court-martial.\nBut reliance is made on r. 3 which reads:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\t      &quot;Where a person subject to military, naval  or\n\t      air-force\t law is brought before a  Magistrate\n\t      and  charged with an offence for which  he  is\n\t      liable  to be tried-by a\tCourt-martial,\tsuch\n\t      Magistrate  shall\t not  proceed  to  try\tsuch\n\t      person  or  to  inquire with  a  view  to\t his\n\t      commitment for trial by the Court of  Sessions\n\t      or  the High Court for any offence triable  by\n\t      such Court, unless,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\t      (a)   he\tis  of opinion, for  reasons  to  be\n\t      recorded,\t that he should so  proceed  without\n\t      being  moved  thereto by\tcompetent  military,\n\t      naval or air-force authority; or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\t      216</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\t      (b) he is moved thereto by such authority.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">This  rule obviously cannot apply unless the  Special  Judge\nconstituted under the <a href=\"/doc/544006/\" id=\"a_96\">Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, 1952</a>, is\na  magistrate within the meaning of  that rule.\t  A  special\njudge  is  appointed  under  s. 6(1)  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/1732853/\" id=\"a_97\">Criminal\t Law\n(Amendment)  Act</a>  to  try the  offences\t specified  therein.\n<a href=\"/doc/515816/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 6(2)</a>, of that Act lays down that &quot;A person shall not\nbe  qualified for appointment as a special judge under\tthis\nAct  unless  he\t is, or has been, a  sessions  Judge  or  an\nadditional  sessions  Judge or an assistant  sessions  Judge\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_99\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1898 (V of 1898).&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_41\">\t      <a href=\"/doc/755709/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 8(1)</a> of the said Act says,\n\t      &quot;A  Special  Judge  may  take  cognizance\t  of\n\t      offences\twithout the accused being  committed\n\t      to  him for trial, and in trying\tthe  accused\n\t      persons, shall follow the procedure prescribed\n\t      by the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_101\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1898 (Act V\n\t      of  1898), for the trial of warrant  cases  by\n\t      magistrates.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">\t      Under sub-s.

This uncontradicted  evidence  clearly\nestablished  that  the\tDeputy Secretary  was  competent  to\naccord sanction on behalf of the President and that he\tgave\nthe  sanction  in exercise of the power\t conferred  on\thim,\npresumably, under the rules framed by the President in\tthis\nbehalf\tThe  statement made by this witness  in\t the  cross-\nexamination is not inconsistent with that made by him in the\nexamination-in-chief.\tThe Deputy Secretary may have  power\nto make some orders in his own right and also may have power\nto  authenticate  other\t orders issued in the  name  of\t the\nPresident.

In this context,\tan  argument\nbased  upon  <a href=\"/doc/990669/\" id=\"a_138\">Art.  77</a> of the Constitution  may\tbe  noticed.\nUnder  el.

The validity of an order of detention made  by\nthe Bombay Government under<a href=\"/doc/44866856/\" id=\"a_142\"> s. 3</a> of the Preventive Detention\nAct,  1950, was considered in The State of Bombay  v.

The High Court,  after\nconsidering  the  entire evidence, found  that\tthe  alleged\nirregularity would not justify the conclusion that the\tnon-\nobservance of the conditions prescribed in the proviso to<a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_176\"> s.\n5A</a>  of the Prevention of Corruption Act had  occasioned\t any\nfailure\t of justice.  Learned counsel has taken\t us  through\ndifferent  steps  in  the investigation\t made  by  the\tsaid\nofficer, and we have no reason to differ from the conclusion\narrived at by the High Court.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">The validity of the investigation made by Jog was questioned\nyet on another ground.\tIt was said that he had not obtained\nthe requisite permission of the State Government under<a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_177\"> s.  6</a>\nof the Delhi Special Police Establishment Act, 1946,  before\nhe  started  the  investigation.   <a href=\"/doc/1796049/\" id=\"a_178\">Section  5</a>  of  that\t Act\nauthorizes the Central Government to extend to any area\t the\npowers\tand  jurisdiction of members of\t the  Delhi  Special\nPolice\tEstablishment for the investigation of any  offences\nor classes of offences specified in a notification under  s.\n3 thereof.  But<a href=\"/doc/775728/\" id=\"a_179\"> s. 6</a> of that Act says that nothing contained\nin  s. 5 shall be deemed to enable any member of  the  Delhi\nSpecial\t  Police  Establishment\t to  exercise\tpowers\t and\njurisdiction  in  any  area in a State, not  being  a  Union\nTerritory  or  railways\t area, without the  consent  of\t the\nGovernment  of that State.  The Government of  Bombay,\tHome\nDepartment,  addressed a letter to the Government of  India,\ndated August 13,1949 and it was stated therein,\n\t      &quot;.....I\tam  directed  to  state\t that\tthis\n\t      Government   re-affirms,\twith  reference\t  to\n\t      <a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_180\">section\t6</a>  of  the  Delhi   Special   Police\n\t      Establishment Act, 1946, the consent given for\n\t      an indefinite period under its letter\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\t      227</span>\n\t      No. 5042/4-D, dated the 6th November 1946,  to\n\t      the  members  of\tthe  Delhi  Special   Police\n\t      Establishment\texercising    powers\t and\n\t      jurisdiction  in the area of the not  province\n\t      of Bombay.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_61\">It  was contended before the High Court and it was  repeated\nbefore\tus that the consent should have been given to  every\nindividual  member of the Special Police  Establishment\t and\nthat  a general consent would not be a good consent.  We  do\nnot see any force in this argument.  Under a. 6 of the <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_181\">Delhi\nSpecial\t Police\t Establishment Act</a>, no member  of  the\tsaid\nEstablishment  can exercise powers and jurisdiction  in\t any\narea  in  a State without the consent of the  Government  of\nthat  State.   That  section does not lay  down\t that  every\nmember\tof  the said Establishment  should  be\tspecifically\nauthorized to exercise jurisdiction in that area, though the\nState  Government  can do so.  When a State  Government\t can\nauthorize   a\tsingle\t officer  to   exercise\t  the\tsaid\njurisdiction, we do not see any legal objection why it could\nnot  authorize\tthe  entire force  operating  in  that\tarea\nbelonging to that Establishment to make such  investigation.\nThe  authorization filed in this case sufficiently  complies\nwith  the  provisions of<a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_182\"> s. 6</a> of the  Delhi  Special  Police\nEstablishment  Act,  1946, and there are no merits  in\tthis\ncontention.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">The  next contention centres round the framing\tof  charges.\nThe charges framed in this case have been fully extracted in\nthe  earlier part of the judgment.  The first  objection  is\nthat  the  Special  Judge had no  jurisdiction\tto  try\t the\naccused\t on  charges  involving offences  other\t than  those\nmentioned  in<a href=\"/doc/1252012/\" id=\"a_183\"> s. 6(1)</a> of the Criminal Law  (Amendment)\tAct,\n1952.\tThis  argument ignores<a href=\"/doc/1487569/\" id=\"a_184\"> s. 7(2)(b)</a> of the  Act  which\nsays,  &quot;When trying any case, a special judge may  also\t try\nany  offence  other than an offence specified in  <a href=\"/doc/775728/\" id=\"a_185\">section  6</a>\nwith  which  the  accused may, under the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_186\">Code\tof  Criminal\nProcedure</a>,  1898,  be  charged\tat  the\t same  trial.&quot;\t The\nobjection, therefore, has no force.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">The next criticism is that there can be no legal charge of a\nconspiracy  between  accused Nos.  1 to 3,  who\t are  public\nservants,  and\taccused\t Nos. 4 to 6,  who  are\t not  public\nservants, in respect of offences under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">228</span>\nthe  <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_187\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> for the reason  that\tthey\ncan  only  be  committed  by  public  servants.\t  But\tthis\ncontention  ignores  the scope of the  offence\tof  criminal\nconspiracy.  <a href=\"/doc/591631/\" id=\"a_188\">Section 120A</a> of the Indian\t Penal Code  defines\n&quot;criminal  conspiracy&quot; and under that definition, &quot;When\t two\nor more persons agree to do, or cause to be done, an illegal\nact,  or an act which is not illegal by illegal means,\tsuch\nan agreement is designated a criminal conspiracy.&quot; The\tgist\nof  the\t offence  is an agreement to  break  the  law.\t The\nparties to such an agreement will be guilty of criminal con-\nspiracy,  though the illegal act agreed to be done  has\t not\nbeen  done.  So too, it is not an ingredient of the  offence\nthat  all  the parties should agree to do a  single  illegal\nact.   It may comprise the commission of a number  of  acts.\nUnder  s.  43  of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_189\">Indian Penal Code</a>,  an  act  would  be\nillegal\t if it is an offence or if it is prohibited by\tlaw.\nUnder  the first charge the accused are charged with  having\nconspired  to do three categories of illegal acts,  and\t the\nmere fact that all of them could not be convicted separately\nin  respect  of\t each of the offences has  no  relevancy  in\nconsidering  the question whether the offence of  conspiracy\nhas  been committed.  They are all guilty of the offence  of\nconspiracy  to\tdo  illegal  acts,  though  for\t  individual\noffences all of them may not be liable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_64\">The second objection is in regard to the second charge.\t  It\nis  said that accused Nos. 4, 5 and 6 could not\t be  charged\nwith  having  committed\t an offence  under  s.\t5(1)(c)\t and\n5(1)(d) of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_190\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, as they are not\npublic\tservants.   The\t learned Judges of  the\t High  Court\naccepted  the said legal position as correct, but held\tthat\nthey  could  be convicted under<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_191\"> s. 109</a> of the  Indian  Penal\nCode,  read  with  cls.\t (c)  and (d)  of  s.  5(1)  of\t the\n<a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_192\">Prevention  of\tCorruption  Act</a>.  But  on  the\tmerits\tthey\nconvicted  accused No. 1 under<a href=\"/doc/1420677/\" id=\"a_193\"> s. 5(2)</a> of the Prevention  of\nCorruption Act, instead of under the said section read\twith<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_194\">\ns.  34</a> of the Indian Penal Code, and they convicted  accused\nNo.  4 under<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_195\"> s. 109</a> of the Indian Penal Code, read  with  s.\n5(1)(c) and (d) of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_196\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a>, instead\nof under<a href=\"/doc/1796049/\" id=\"a_197\"> s. 5(2)</a> of the said\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">\t\t\t    229</span>\nAct,  read with<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_198\"> s. 34</a> of the Indian Penal Code.\t <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1347962\" id=\"span_43\">As  accused\nNo.  4 was dead before the appeal was filed in\tthis  Court,\nnothing\t need be said about the legality of his\t conviction.\nThe  only  outstanding question, therefore, is\twhether\t the\nHigh  Court was justified in convicting accused No. 1  under<a href=\"/doc/1420677/\" id=\"a_199\">\ns. 5(2)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act instead of under\nthe  said section read with<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_200\"> s. 34</a> of the Indian Penal  Code.\nTo  such a situation, s. 537 of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_201\">Criminal Procedure\tCode</a>\napplies\t and  under that section, no sentence  passed  by  a\ncourt of competent jurisdiction shall be reversed or altered\non  appeal or revision on account of an error,\tomission  or\nirregularity  in  the charge, including\t any  misjoinder  of\ncharges,  unless  such\terror,\tomission,  irregularity\t  or\nmisdirection  has in fact occasioned a failure\tof  justice.\nThis  Court in <a href=\"/doc/1347962/\" id=\"a_202\">W. Slaney v. State of M. P.</a> (1) held that  in\nadjudging  a question of prejudice the concern of the  court\nshould\tbe  to\tsee whether the accused had  a\tfair  trial,\nwhether he knew what he was being tried for, whether the im-\npugned\tfacts  sought  to be established  against  him\twere\nexplained to him clearly and fairly and whether he was given\na  full\t and fair chance to defend himself.  Judged  by\t the\nsaid  test it is manifest that accused No. I cannot be\tsaid\nto  have been prejudiced by his conviction under<a href=\"/doc/1420677/\" id=\"a_203\"> s. 5(2)</a>  of\nthe  Prevention\t of Corruption Act, for accused\t No.  I\t had\nclear knowledge from the inception that the prosecution case\nagainst\t him was that he committed an offence under<a href=\"/doc/1420677/\" id=\"a_204\"> s.\t5(2)</a>\nof  the Prevention of Corruption Act and that he  had  every\nopportunity,   and  indeed  he\tmade  a\t  sustained   effort\nthroughout  the\t trial to defend himself  against  the\tsaid\naccusation.   It is not possible to hold in this  case\tthat\nthere was any failure of justice by reason of the High Court\nconvicting  him for a substantive offence under<a href=\"/doc/1796049/\" id=\"a_205\"> s.  5(2)</a>  of\nthe said Act.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">So  far\t as the third head of the charge is  concerned,\t the\nHigh Court held that it was bad in regard to accused No.  1.\nAccused\t  No.  1,  therefore,  cannot  obviously  have\t any\ngrievance with that finding.  For the foregoing reasons,  we\nhold that there are no merits\n(1)[1955] 2 S.C.R. 1140.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">230</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_66\">in the contentions raised by learned counsel on the basis of\nthe charges framed in this case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">Now  we\t come  to the merits of the case.   So\tfar  as\t the\nappellant  is  concerned,  both the Special  Judge  and,  on\nappeal the High Court accepted the evidence of Lawrence,  as\nit  was\t corroborated  in  material  particulars  by   other\nacceptable  evidence.\tThey  concurrently  found  that\t the\nappellant was a party to the conspiracy.  The finding is one\nof fact, and the practice of this Court is not to  interfere\nwith such finding except under exceptional circumstances.\nLearned\t counsel  for  the  appellant  made  a\tserious\t and\nsustained  attempt  to\thave the said  finding\treopened  by\nadvancing arguments under the following three heads: (1) The\nHigh  Court has failed to draw correct inferences  from\t the\nfacts  found  by  it and has  also  drawn  wrong  conclusion\nignoring probabilities arising in a given situation; (2) the\nHigh Court has ignored the distinction between an untruthful\nwitness\t and  a truthful witness, whose evidence  under\t the\nrule  of prudence could be accepted only in so far as it  is\ncorroborated  in material particulars, and the\tHigh  Court,\nhaving\t disbelieved  Lawrence&#x27;s  evidence  in\t regard\t  to\nimportant  incidents in his narration, should have  rejected\nhis evidence in toto; and if it had done so, the question of\ncorroboration would not arise for consideration; and (3) the\nindependent  pieces of evidence accepted by the\t High  Court\ndid  not  corroborate the evidence of Lawrence\tin  material\nparticulars implicating him in the crime.\nThe first argument is a direct attack on the correctness  of\nthe  finding  of fact arrived at by the High Court.   As  we\nhave  said,  the practice of this Court in an  appeal  under\n<a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_206\">Art. 136</a> of the Constitution is not to allow such an  attack\nexcept\t in  exceptional  circumstances.   Learned   counsel\naddressed  at  some length on this aspect of the  case,\t and\nafter hearing him, we were satisfied that there were no such\nexceptional   circumstances  present  in  this\tcase.\t Our\nreluctance to depart from the usual practice is hightened by\nthe  fact that in the present case, so far as the  appellant\nis concerned, there are concurrent findings of fact by\tboth\nthe courts.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\t\t\t    231</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"331677\" id=\"span_46\">The  second  argument  is a subtle  attempt  to\t reopen\t the\nfindings  of  fact  from  a  different\tperspective.\tThis\nargument  is based upon a decision of this Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/331677/\" id=\"a_207\">Sarwan\nSingh\tv.  The\t State\tof  Punjab</a>  (1).   In\tthat   case,\nGajendragadkar,\t J., speaking for the Court, observed at  p.\n959 thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">\t      &quot;But  it must never be forgotten\tthat  before\n\t      the Court reaches the stage of considering the\n\t      question of corroboration and its adequacy  or\n\t      otherwise,  the  first initial  and  essential\n\t      question\tto  consider is whether even  as  an\n\t      accomplice the approver is a reliable witness.\n\t      If the answer to this question is against\t the\n\t      approver\tthen there is an end of the  matter,\n\t      and no question as to whether his evidence  is\n\t      corroborated  or not falls to  be\t considered.\n\t      In   other  words,  the  appreciation  of\t  an\n\t      approver&#x27;s  evidence has to satisfy  a  double\n\t      test.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">\t      Then the learned Judge proceeded to state,\n\t      &quot;We have carefully read the judgment delivered\n\t      by the High Court but we find no indication in\n\t      the  whole  of the judgment that\tthe  learned\n\t      Judges   considered  the\tcharacter   of\t the\n\t      approver&#x27;s evidence and reached the conclusion\n\t      that  it was the evidence given by a  reliable\n\t      witness.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">\t      Later on the learned Judge further stated,\n\t       &quot;........ the evidence of the approver is  so\n\t      thoroughly   discrepant  that  it\t  would\t  be\n\t      difficult\t to resist the conclusion  that\t the\n\t      approver\tin  the\t present case  is  a  wholly\n\t      unreliable witness.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">Relying\t upon these observations, learned  counsel  contends\nthat  in the present case the High Court did not accept\t the\nevidence  of the approver in regard to important events\t and\ntherefore  the High Court should have rejected his  evidence\nwithout\t further  attempting to see whether  there  was\t any\ncorroboration in material particulars in other evidence.\nBefore we consider this argument in the context of the facts\nof  the\t present case, we would like at the outset  to\tmake\nsome  general  observations.   This  Court  could  not\thave\nintended to lay down that the evidence\n(1)  [1957] S.C.R. 953.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">232</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">of  an\tapprover and the corroborating\tpieces\tof  evidence\nshould be treated in two different compartments, that is  to\nsay, the Court shall have first to consider the evidence  of\nthe approver dehors the corroborated pieces of evidence\t and\nreject it if it comes to the conclusion that his evidence is\nunreliable;  but  if it comes to the conclusion that  it  is\nreliable then it will have to consider whether that evidence\nis  corroborated by any other evidence.\t This Court did\t not\nlay  down  any such proposition.  In that case\tit  happened\nthat  the  evidence  of\t the  approver\twas  so\t  thoroughly\ndiscrepant  that  the  Court thought that he  was  a  wholly\nunreliable  witness.  But in most of the cases the said\t two\naspects\t would\tbe so interconnected that it  would  not  be\npossible  to give a separate treatment, for as often as\t not\nthe  reliability  of  an  approver&#x27;s  evidence,\t though\t not\nexclusively,  would  mostly depend  upon  the  corroborative\nsupport\t it  derives  from  other  unimpeachable  pieces  of\nevidence.   We\tmust  also make it clear  that\twe  are\t not\nequating the evidence of Lawrence with that of an  approver;\nnor did the Special Judge or the High Court put him  exactly\non that footing.  The learned Special Judge in his  judgment\nobserved thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">\t      &quot;He  (Lawrence) is obviously decoy or spy\t and\n\t      agent provocateur and his evidence will  have,\n\t      therefore, to be approached with great caution\n\t      and  much\t weight\t cannot be  attached  to  it\n\t      unless it is corroborated by other independent\n\t      evidence\t  and\t circumstances\t  in\t the\n\t      case....................\tNot  being   tainted\n\t      evidence,\t  it   would  not  suffer   from   a\n\t      disability  of  being unworthy  of  acceptance\n\t      without independent corroboration.

To\n\t      convict an accused on the tainted evidence  of\n\t      an  accomplice  is  not  illegal\tbut  it\t  is\n\t      imprudent;  to  convict an  accused  upon\t the\n\t      partisan\t evidence  of  a  person  at   whose\n\t      instance\ta  trap\t is laid by  the  police  is\n\t      neither illegal nor imprudent but inadvisable\n\t      therefore,  be accepted and relied upon,\tonly\n\t      if  it  is corroborated by  other\t independent\n\t      evidence and circumstances in the case.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">\t\t\t    233</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">The learned Judges of the High Court practically adopted the\nsame  attitude\tin  the\t manner of  their  approach  to\t the\nevidence of Lawrence.  The learned Judges observed:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">\t      &quot;To  convict  an\taccused\t upon  the  partisan\n\t      evidence of a person at whose instance a\ttrap\n\t      is  laid by the police is neither illegal\t nor\n\t      imprudent, because it is just possible that in\n\t      some  cases  an accomplice may  give  evidence\n\t      because he may have a feeling in his own\tmind\n\t      that  it is a condition of his pardon to\tgive\n\t      that  evidence,  but  no\tsuch   consideration\n\t      obtains  in  the\tcase of the  evidence  of  a\n\t      person who is not a guilty associate in  crime\n\t      but who invites the police to lay a trap.\t All\n\t      the same, as the person who lodges information\n\t      with  the police for the purpose of  laying  a\n\t      trap   for  another  is  a  partisan   witness\n\t      interested  in seeing that the trap  succeeds,\n\t      it  would be necessary and advisable  to\tlook\n\t      for  corroboration  to  his  evidence   before\n\t      accepting it.  But the degree of corroboration\n\t      in  the  case  of a  tainted  evidence  of  an\n\t      accomplice  would be higher than that  in\t the\n\t      case  of a partisan witness.  In our  opinion,\n\t      all  these decisions would  clearly  establish\n\t      that  it\twould  not be safe to  rely  on\t the\n\t      evidence of Lawrence who is admittedly a decoy\n\t      or  trap witness, without his testimony  being\n\t      corroborated from independent sources.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">Even  Mr.  Amin, learned special counsel on  behalf  of\t the\nState asked the courts to proced to examine the evidence  of\nLawrence on the basis that he was a decoy or trap witness.\nWe  are\t definitely  of opinion that  both  the\t courts\t had\napproached   the  evidence  of\tLawrence  from\t a   correct\nstandpoint.   Though  Lawrence was not an approver,  he\t was\ncertainly  an  interested witness in the sense that  he\t was\ninterested  to see that the trap laid by him succeeded.\t  He\ncould  at  least be equated with a partisan witness  and  it\nwould  not be admissible to rely upon such evidence  without\ncorroboration.\tIt would be equally clear that his  evidence\nwas  not a tainted one, but it would only make a  difference\nin the 30\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">234</span>\ndegree\tof corroboration required rather than the  necessity\nfor it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">Approaching the case from this perspective-in our view\tthat\nis  a  correct\tone-the learned Special Judge  came  to\t the\nfollowing conclusion:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">\t      &quot;There  was no compelling necessity  for\tShri\n\t      Lawrence\tto  concoct a  false  story  against\n\t      Major  Barsay and the other accused.

Though the learned  Judges  of\nthe  High Court rejected the evidence of Lawrence in  regard\nto some events either because that part of the evidence\t was\nnot consistent with the other parts of his evidence or\twith\nthe  evidence of some disinterested witnesses, they did\t not\nsee  any reason to reject the story given by Lawrence  as  a\nmyth  or a concoction.\tAfter considering the evidence,\t the\nlearned Judges concluded,\n\t      &quot;We,  therefore, accept  Lawrence&#x27;s  evidence,\n\t      find  that his story is probable and true\t and\n\t      we  also find that the evidence on the  record\n\t      justifies the finding of the trial Court\tthat\n\t      there  was  a  conspiracy as  alleged  by\t the\n\t      prosecution  to smuggle goods out of the\tDehu\n\t      Vehicles Depot.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">Having\taccepted broadly the version given by Lawrence,\t the\nHigh  Court  took the case of each of the accused  and\theld\nthat in the case of accused Nos. 1 to 4 Lawrence&#x27;s  evidence\nhad  been  amply  corroborated\tby  other  evidence  in\t all\nmaterial  particulars.\t In these circumstances,  we  cannot\naccept\tthe contention of learned counsel for the  appellant\nthat  the High Court had rejected the evidence of  Lawrence.\nAs we have said, the High Court did not accept some parts of\nthe  evidence of Lawrence, but it had broadly  accepted\t the\nversion\t given by Lawrence in regard to the  conspiracy\t and\nthe manner in which the articles were smuggled\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">235</span>\nout of the Depot.  If some of the accused were acquitted  it\nwas because there were some discrepancies in the evidence of\nLawrence  in respect of them and particularly  because\tthat\npart  of  his  evidence was  not  corroborated\tin  material\nparticulars  by\t other\tevidence.  But in the  case  of\t the\nappellant  the\tHigh Court accepted the\t evidence  given  by\nLawrence  and convicted the appellant because  that  version\nwas corroborated in all material particulars by the evidence\nof  other  disinterested witnesses.  We,  therefore,  reject\nthis contention.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">This  leads  us to the consideration of the  only  remaining\nquestion,    namely,   whether\t Lawrence&#x27;s   evidence\t  is\ncorroborated   in  material  particulars   implicating\t the\nappellant  by other acceptable evidence.  The  corroboration\nmust be by independent testimony confirming in some material\nparticulars  not only that the crime was committed but\talso\nthat  the  appellant committed it.  It is not  necessary  to\nhave  corroboration of all the circumstances of the case  or\nevery detail of the crime.  It would be sufficient if  there\nwas  corroboration as to the material circumstances  of\t the\ncrime and of the identity of the accused in relation to\t the\ncrime.\t These\tprinciples  have  been\tsettled\t in  R.\t  v.\nBaskerville,  (1) which has rightly been considered  as\t the\nlocus  classicus of the law of approver&#x27;s evidence  and\t has\nbeen followed by courts in India.  Looking from that aspect,\nboth the courts have found corroboration from  disinterested\nwitnesses in material particulars implicating the  appellant\nin  the\t crime.\t  Lawrence gave a detailed  account  of\t the\nunfurling of the scheme of fraud from the date he met  Major\nBarsay on December 2, 1954, upto December 20, 1954, when the\noffending truck was obstructed by the police from proceeding\nfurther on its onward journey.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">Lawrence  stated in his evidence that on December  3,  1954,\nMajor Barsay told him, inter alia, that he had chalked out a\ndetailed scheme in consultation with Kochhar to transfer all\nthe  valuable parts lying in Shed No. 48 to Shed No. 17\t for\nthe  purpose of itemization, that he had  &#x27;already  recalled\nKochhar from\n(1) [1916] 2 K.B. 658.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">236</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">leave  of absence prior to its expiry and posted him in\t the\nKit  Stores,  and that he had also posted  Avatarsingh\tfrom\nUnfit  Sub  Park  to the Kit Stores.   The  prosecution\t has\nestablished   by  clear\t evidence  that\t Major\tBarsay\t was\ninstrumental  in posting Kochhar, accused No. 2, to the\t Kit\nStores\tafter  asking him to cut short his leave  which\t was\nfor,  a\t period of two months.\tIt was also  established  by\nevidence  that Major Barsay brought Avatarsingh to  the\t Kit\nStores.\t  Though  these\t facts\tmight  not  have  implicated\nKochhar\t and  Avatarsingh, they\t certainly  corroborate\t the\nevidence  of Lawrence that Major Barsay told him that  these\ntransfers were made to facilitate the implementation of\t the\nscheme.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">Lawrence  stated in his evidence that Major Barsay told\t him\non  December  3, 1954, that he had chalked  out\t a  detailed\nscheme\tin  consultation with Kochhar to  transfer  all\t the\nvaluable  parts lying in Shed No. 48 to Shed No. 17 for\t the\npurpose\t of  itemization, and that as soon as the  Board  of\nOfficers  was appointed there would be a shuttle  of  trucks\nmoving\tfrom Shed No. 48 to Shed No. 17 and vice  versa\t and\nnobody&#x27;s suspicion would be roused if one or two trucks were\ntaken  away out of the main gate during the course of  these\nmovements  of the trucks between these two sheds.  There  is\nevidence  to show that a Board of Officers was appointed  to\ndo the work of itemization and that one Captain Mehendiratta\nwas appointed the President of that Board.\nLawrence said that Major Barsay told him that he would\tshow\ncertain\t boxes\tfrom Shed No. 48 to Col.  Rao and  tell\t him\nthat  they did not contain many of the articles\t which\tthey\nwere  said to contain, so that Col.  Rao also would  not  be\nsurprised  at the final result of the itemization.   It\t has\nbeen established by other evidence that on December 8, 1954,\nMajor  Barsay went to Col.  Rao and took him to Shed No.  48\nand  showed  him the military stores that were\tlying  there\nawaiting itemization.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_82\">At about midday on December 18, 1954, Lawrence stated, Major\nBarsay met him at the Depot and told him that he and  other\nconspirators would meet at his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">\t\t\t    237</span>\nresidence  to discuss about the scheme.\t It is\tin  evidence\nthat  on  the  18th the meeting was held as  deposed  to  by\nLawrence.  Evidence of Col.  Sindhi and Capt.  Sharma, which\nwas accepted by both the courts, establishes this fact.\t The\nsame  evidence also establishes that at that  meeting  Major\nBarsay,\t Saighal, Lawrence and two Sikhs were  present,\t and\nthough the two Sikhs were not identified to be accused\tNos.\n2 and 3, the presence of accused Nos.  1 and 4 and two Sikhs\ncorroborates the evidence of Lawrence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">Lawrence stated that at that meeting Major Barsay  undertook\nto  do certain things.\tAccording to Lawrence  Major  Barsay\ntold  the conspirators that he would detail a driver of\t his\nconfidence  in\ta vehicle for executing the  plan,  that  he\nwould send Kochhar to Shed No. 17, order Kochhar to transfer\nthe  itemized  goods  from  Shed  No.  17  to  Shed  No.  26\nostensibly  for the purpose of preservation, that  he  would\ncall  Major Nag on Monday (December 20) and in his  presence\nhe  would  order Lawrence to go to the D.O.D. to  bring\t the\nfire  hoses.   The  evidence  of  Havaldar  Pillay,   Godse,\nSuryawanshi  and  G.  K. Pillay establishes  the  fact\tthat\nBarsay\tsecured one truck and a driver for shifting  of\t the\nstores\tfrom  Shed No. 17 to Shed No. 26.  The\tevidence  of\nJamadar\t Lachmansing proves that Major Barsay went  to\tShed\nNo. 17 and ordered the shifting of stores from there to Shed\nNo.  26 for conditioning and preservation.  The evidence  of\nMajor Nag establishes that in his presence Major Barsay sent\nfor  Lawrence and asked the latter to go to the\t D.O.D.\t and\nexpedite  the return of the fire hoses.\t  These\t established\nfacts  certainly corroborate the evidence of Lawrence as  to\nwhat took place on the 18th and also his evidence that Major\nBarsay gave the said instructions to him in the presence  of\nMajor Nag.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">The evidence of Lawrence that Major Barsay told him and\t the\nother conspirators that there should be two loadings of\t the\ntrucks at Shed No. 17, the first loading to carry  innocuous\narticles and the second the articles intended to be smuggled\nout  of\t the Depot, was also corroborated  by  disinterested\nevidence.  Both the courts accepted that evidence.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">238</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">Then  there  is evidence of the movements  of  Major  Barsay\nduring the crucial time when the smuggling out of the  goods\nwas scheduled to take place.  The evidence of Jogendrasingh,\nRambhan\t and Wagh shows that at about 1-10 p.m. on  December\n20, 1954, Major Barsay was rather worried and was moving  to\nand  fro near the main gate because he was  suspecting\tthat\nsomebody    was\t  watching   their    movements.     Jamadar\nJogendrasingh  deposed that Major Barsay asked him  to\ttell\nLawrence,  &quot;not to do it as there was  something  suspicious\nabout  it.&quot;  Major Nag also supported this  version.   These\nnervous movements of Major Barsay certainly corroborate\t the\nevidence  of Lawrence that he was the moving spirit  in\t the\nconspiracy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">The  evidence of Lawrence that the duty of going along\twith\nthe  truck  was allotted to his part in\t the  conspiracy  is\ncorroborated   by  the\tcircumstances  establisbed  by\t the\nevidence  that Lawrence got into the truck near Shed No.  17\nand went in the truck to its destination.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">The evidence of Lawrence regarding how Major Barsay directed\nthe smuggling of the goods out of the Depot was corroborated\nby other independent evidence.\tThere is evidence of Jog and\nDiwate to show that on December 19, in the morning,  Saighal\nshowed the spot where the transshipment was to take place to\nLawrence.   There is the evidence of Darekar to show that  a\ntruck  was arranged and that he was asked by  Yakubsaheb  to\ntake his truck to Talegaon for the transport of iron  goods.\nThere  is  also\t the evidence of Darekar  and  Hatnolkar  to\nestablish that accused No. 4 was waiting near the cemetry on\nthe   Talegaon-Dabhade\tRoad  and  that\t Darekar  was\talso\ninstructed by Saighal to park the lorry in a particular way.\nThen  there is the evidence of the police officers that\t the\ngoods  brought in the military lorry were being\t transported\ninto the civilian truck when they came on the scene.\nAll  this evidence supports the version of Lawrence when  he\nsaid that Major Barsay gave the necessary instructions as to\nthe  manner  of\t transport  of the  military  goods  to\t the\ncivilian truck.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">\t\t\t    239</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">The  said  facts found by both the  courts  below  implicate\naccused No. 1 in the matter of the preparation, laying\tdown\nof the details of implementation and the actual carrying out\nof  the\t scheme\t of smuggling the goods\t out  of  the  Depot\nthrough\t all  the  stages and  thereby\testablish  that\t the\nappellant was the main conspirator and the brain behind\t the\nconspiracy.   We  cannot, therefore, say  that\tthe  version\ngiven by Lawrence implicating accused No. 1 is not  corrobo-\nrated  by other independent evidence.  It follows  that\t the\nconviction of the appellant by the High Court is correct.\nThis  leads us to the appeal filed by the State against\t the\njudgment  of the High Court acquitting accused Nos. 2 and  3\non the ground that the evidence of Lawrence implicating them\nin the offence was not corroborated in material\t particulars\nby  independent evidence.  In this appeal also we  have\t not\nallowed\t learned  counsel  for\tthe  State  to\tcanvass\t the\ncorrectness  of the finding arrived at by the High Court  on\nthe  appreciation of the evidence in the case.\t Taking\t the\nfindings arrived at by the High Court, we find it  difficult\nto take a different view from that taken by the High  Court.\nIn  regard  to accused No. 2 the High Court arrived  at\t the\nfollowing  findings: (1) There is no evidence or  allegation\non  the\t record\t to show that there  was  any  understanding\nbetween\t him  and  Major  Barsay  before  he  left  on\t two\nmonths leave. (2) There is no evidence that Kochhar, accused\nNo.  2, met Lawrence on December 6, 1954. (3) Accused No.  2\nmoved  Major Barsay by his letter (Ex. 151) to\tconvene\t the\nitemization board. (4) Prior to the appointment of the board\nand its constitution, accused No. 2 ordered the shifting  of\nthe &quot;specialist boxed kits&quot; from Shed No. 48 to Shed No. 17,\nbut  this  was done under Major Barsay&#x27;s  instructions.\t (5)\nAccused\t No.  2 was present when Fernandez  was\t ordered  by\nMajor Barsay to complete the identification of the first set\nbefore\tDecember  13,  even by working on  Sunday  the\t12th\nDecember, and in that connection a written order was  issued\nby him on December 11. (6) On December 12 Lawrence persuaded\naccused No. 2 to go in for two\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">240</span>\ninsurance  policies.  (7)  Though  according  to   Lawrence,\nKochhar\t undertook to prepare a bogus voucher and to  be  at\nthe Depot at the opening hours on Monday the 20th to prepare\nthat voucher in the office of Lawrence, it is admitted\tthat\nKochhar refused to issue the voucher. (8) Accused No. 2\t was\npresent\t at Shed No. 17 when Major Barsay issued  orders  to\nshift  the  stores to Shed No. 26.  And (9)  Accused  No.  2\naccompanied  Major Barsay to Shed No. 19 in the morning\t and\nlie  was  present when the truck was being  loaded  for\t the\nsecond\ttrip at Shed No. 17.  The High Court found that\t the\nsaid  circumstances,  though  some of  them  might  raise  a\nsuspicion,  did not implicate accused No. 2 in\tthe  offence\nand  they  are consistent also with his\t innocence.   Though\nsome  of the facts give rise to a suspicion, we\t cannot\t say\nthat the High Court was wrong in holding that the said facts\ndid not corroborate the evidence of Lawrence in\t implicating\nthe said accused in the offence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">Now  coming  to\t accused No. 3, the  High  Court  found\t the\nfollowing  facts  based on the evidence other than  that  of\nLawrence:  (1)\tAvatarsing, accused No. 3,  was\t transferred\nfrom  Unfit Sub Park to Kit Stores. (2) Accused No. 3 was  a\nparty to the shifting of stores from Shed No. 48 to Shed No.\n17 even before the appointment of the board of\titemization.\n(3)  Though  Lawrence stated that Avatarsing  expressed\t his\ninability  to push the scheme on account of Capt.   Kapoor&#x27;s\nconstant  vigilance and visits to Shed No. 17, Lawrence\t had\nadmitted  that his first contact with Avatarsing was in\t the\nnoon  of  18th\tDecember.  (4) There  is  no  evidence\tthat\nAvatarsing  attended  the meeting at Major Barsay&#x27;s  on\t the\n18th. (5) Avatarsing loaded the truck for the first trip and\nalso for the second trip, and in loading the second trip  he\nused  the usual laborers and two outside workers. (6)  After\nthe truck was loaded, he asked Rambhan to take the truck  to\nD. 0. D. under instructions from the superior officers.\t (7)\nThe  words  &quot;D. O. D.&quot; in Ex. 42, the duty  slip,  were\t not\nentered\t by Avatarsing.\t The High Court held that  the\tsaid\nfacts  found on independent evidence did not  implicate\t the\nsaid accused in the offence and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">\t\t\t    241</span>\nthey were all consistent with his innocence.  Though some of\nthe  findings give rise to suspicion we cannot say that\t the\nHigh  Court was wrong in holding that the said\tfacts  found\ndid not corroborate the evidence of Lawrence in\t implicating\nthe  accused  in  the offence.\tWe,  therefore,\t accept\t the\nfinding of the High Court in regard to accused Nos. 2 and 3.\nIn the result both the appeals fail and are dismissed.\nAppeals dismissed.\n</p>\n\n\n","numcites":68,"numcitedby":251,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":342903,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"court martial","formInput":"court%20martial"},{"value":"interested witness","formInput":"interested%20witness"},{"value":"\"witness\"\"unreliable\"","formInput":"%22witness%22%22unreliable%22"},{"value":"evidence of approver","formInput":"evidence%20of%20approver"},{"value":"prevention of corruption act","formInput":"prevention%20of%20corruption%20act"},{"value":"corroborative evidence ","formInput":"corroborative%20evidence%20"},{"value":"no common intention","formInput":"no%20common%20intention"},{"value":"criminal misconduct","formInput":"criminal%20misconduct"},{"value":" criminal amendment act,1952","formInput":"%20criminal%20amendment%20act%2C1952"},{"value":"unreliable witness","formInput":"unreliable%20witness"},{"value":"theft","formInput":"theft"},{"value":"criminal law amendment act","formInput":"criminal%20law%20amendment%20act"},{"value":"section 125","formInput":"section%20125"},{"value":"\"prevention of corruption act\"","formInput":"%22prevention%20of%20corruption%20act%22"},{"value":"trap witness","formInput":"trap%20witness"},{"value":"trap","formInput":"trap"},{"value":"who is partisan witness","formInput":"who%20is%20partisan%20witness"},{"value":"delhi special police establishment act","formInput":"delhi%20special%20police%20establishment%20act"},{"value":"wholly unreliable","formInput":"wholly%20unreliable"},{"value":"accomplice","formInput":"accomplice"}],"cats":[{"value":"army","formInput":"tag:army"},{"value":"criminal-procedure-code","formInput":"tag:criminal-procedure-code"},{"value":"corruption","formInput":"tag:corruption"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
