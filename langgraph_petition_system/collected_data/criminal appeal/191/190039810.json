Aggrieved, the appellants in all three cases and similarly situated\n\npersons approached the High Court of Judicature at Patna. The High Court\n\nby its common judgment and order dated 09.10.2017 in Crl. Misc. No.\n\n29168 of 2017 and other connected cases, rejected the challenge. Paras 42,\n\n43 and 45 of the judgment were as under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">      “42. Thus, I see no merit in the submission of the learned\n      counsel for the petitioners that the aforesaid order would not\n      bind the petitioners, who were not parties before the Supreme\n      Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      43. So far as the point of pledging of property for the value\n      of paddy in lieu of bank guarantee, and non-requirement of\n      bank guarantee in such cases are concerned, they were already\n      raised before the Supreme Court by the rice millers, which is\n      evident from the plain reading of the order of the Supreme\n      Court, but the Supreme Court did not accept their contention\n      and passed order for deposit of bank guarantee.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">      45. So far as the liberty granted to this Court to modify the\n      directions issued by the Supreme Court is concerned, as the\n      order of the Supreme Court has already taken effect and the\n      pre-arrest bail granted to the petitioners already stood cancelled,\n      it is not permissible for this Court to modify the directions\n      issued by the Supreme Court. May be that in appropriate case,\n      having regard to the individual fact situation, in view of the\n      liberty granted by the Supreme Court, this Court could have\n      modified any condition if the petitioner(s) would have\n      approached this Court in time. However, such a recourse would\n      be impermissible once the order of the Supreme Court has\n      taken its effect. I am also of the opinion that if the persons are\n      aggrieved by the order of the Supreme Court regarding deposit\n      of bank guarantee, the only course left to them is to approach\n      the Supreme Court and till the time the order of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                                                            14</span>\n\n\n      Supreme Court stands, the petitioners, whether they were party\n      before the Supreme Court or not have to abide by its orders.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">13.   The appellants in all three cases have approached this Court\n\nchallenging the correctness of the view taken by the High Court. Similar\n\nsuch petitions have also been filed by other persons.

Only such bank guarantee was to be\n\nfurnished and kept alive.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">      (c)    In cases where concerned millers had pledged their properties,\n\nthe interest of the corporation was well secured and there could not be any\n\ninsistence on furnishing of bank guarantee by way of additional security.\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">14.   Appearing for the respondent-State, Mr. Ranjit Kumar, learned Senior\n\nAdvocate submitted:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                                                            15</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">      (a)     About 1500 crores of public money was involved in all the\n\n      matters.

The aforesaid three criminal appeals, the facts whereof are discussed\n\nin detail in preceding paragraphs show that there were three categories of\n\nmatters. In the first, the miller was to give bank guarantee equivalent to the\n\nvalue of paddy. However in case of his inability to furnish such bank\n\nguarantee, the facility of pledging unencumbered immovable property was\n\nafforded to him. The miller was however required to provide minimum\n\nbank guarantee. In the second matter, the bank guarantee had to be given in\n\nrespect of value of paddy.       Here also an option was given to pledge\n\nimmovable property in lieu of the requirement of furnishing of bank\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                                                            16</span>\n\n\nguarantee. Though there appears to be slight distinction in phraseology\n\nemployed in the concerned clauses, the intent appears to be identical. It is\n\nalso a matter of record that the appellant in the second matter had pledged\n\nhis land valued at Rs.1.3 crores and was not required to furnish any bank\n\nguarantee. In the third matter, there was no requirement of furnishing any\n\nbank guarantee at all and all that the agreement insisted upon was furnishing\n\nof security.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">      The requirement of furnishing bank guarantee was thus not mandatory\n\nand an option was given to the miller to pledge his unencumbered\n\nimmovable property.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">16.   The matters therefore lie in a short compass. The order granting\n\nanticipatory bail/bail to the millers was challenged by the State/Corporation\n\nin matters which came up before this Court on 28.02.2017. While declining\n\nto cancel such orders granting anticipatory bails/bail, this Court deemed it\n\nproper to impose certain additional conditions. The first condition was that,\n\nin all FIRs the concerned accused would ensure that bank guarantee was\n\nfurnished and kept alive, failing which, the benefit of anticipatory bails/bail\n\nwould stand cancelled. The reference to “Bank Guarantee” in said condition\n\nNo.1 was to the obligation arising from the agreement entered into with each\n\nof the accused.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                                                            17</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">17.   It may be noted here that prior to the passing of the order dated\n\n28.02.2017, none of the orders passed by the High Court or this Court\n\nrequired furnishing of bank guarantee or keeping it alive in respect of the\n\n“defalcated sum”. The order passed by this Court on 28.02.2017 is quite\n\nclear. The reference to “Bank Guarantee” and the condition modulated in\n\nthat behalf was one which the accused was obliged to and had undertaken to\n\nfurnish in terms of the agreement. If according to the terms of the agreement\n\nand the benefit enjoyed by the concerned accused, he had already pledged\n\nunencumbered immovable property in the equivalent sum, there was no\n\nrequirement to furnish and to keep alive additional bank guarantee.\n\nTherefore the Corporation was not justified in demanding that the millers\n\nmust furnish bank guarantee in respect of “defalcated sum”. The trial court\n\nwas also not justified in cancelling the facility of bail/anticipatory bail\n\nalready enjoyed by the miller and in issuing non-bailable warrants.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">18.   However there are certain categories of persons, who were enjoined to\n\nfurnish bank guarantee, in terms of their agreement, to keep such bank\n\nguarantee alive, had completely failed in that behalf. Such failure on their\n\npart was in complete derogation and violation of the order dated 28.02.2017\n\npassed by this Court. In such cases the trial court was certainly justified in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                                                             18</span>\n\n\ncancelling the facility of bail/anticipatory bail extended to such millers and\n\nto issue non-bailable warrants of arrest. There is one more category of cases\n\nwhere the millers in question were not parties to the proceedings in this\n\nCourt which were disposed of by order dated 28.02.2017. The submission in\n\nthat behalf made by such millers that the condition imposed by this Court\n\nwould not apply to them was rightly rejected by the trial court and we affirm\n\nthe view so taken.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">19.   We now come to the last submission made by Mr. Ranjit Kumar,\n\nlearned Senior Advocate. The idea behind requirement of furnishing bank\n\nguarantee and or pledge of unencumbered property was to ensure sufficient\n\nsecurity in the hands of the Corporation. Going by the terms of the\n\nagreement, in case there be any failure on part of the concerned miller to\n\ndischarge his obligations, the Corporation would certainly be entitled and\n\njustified to take appropriate steps to secure its interest either by encashing\n\nthe bank guarantee and or by disposing the pledged properties in accordance\n\nwith law. We therefore accept the submission and hold that the Corporation,\n\nin such cases, would be well within its rights to take appropriate steps in the\n\nconcerned matters.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                                                            19</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">20.   In the circumstances we direct:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">      a)     The expression “Bank Guarantee” used in condition No.1 as\n\nstipulated in order dated 28.02.2017 passed by this Court pertains to bank\n\nguarantee which the concerned miller was obliged, in terms of the agreement\n\nin question to furnish. The obligation to furnish the bank guarantee and to\n\nkeep it alive is referable to the terms of the agreement and not to the\n\n“defalcated sum” as was submitted by the Corporation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">      b)     If on account of failure to submit and to keep it alive in respect\n\nof the “defalcated sum”, any benefit of bail/anticipatory bail was withdrawn\n\nand orders of non-bailable warrants were issued, such orders stand cancelled\n\nand recalled. However the concerned millers ought to have furnished and\n\nkept alive bank guarantees as contemplated in terms of the agreement. If\n\nthere be any failure on this count the cancellation of bail/anticipatory bail\n\nwas perfectly justified.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">      c)     The order dated 28.02.2017 passed by this Court would apply\n\nto every single case, irrespective whether the concerned miller was a party to\n\nthe proceedings before this Court or not.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">      d)     If any miller, in terms of the order dated 28.02.2017, had not\n\nfurnished bank guarantee or had not kept it alive in terms of his obligations\n\nunder the agreement, the facility of bail/anticipatory bail would not be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                                                           20</span>\n\n\navailable to him. The orders cancelling such facility stand confirmed and\n\nthe challenge in that behalf is negated. All such millers shall be immediately\n\ntaken in custody by the concerned Police.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">       e)      We permit the Corporation to secure its interest either by\n\ninvoking the bank guarantees wherever furnished and or by putting to\n\nauction the unencumbered immovable property pledged by the millers with\n\nit, after due process of law.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">21.
