The appellant-accused, at the relevant time, (1.3.1992 to\n\n         11.3.1993) was working as Sorting Assistant in Bangalore\n\n         Packet Sorting Office, Head Record Office (Main Unit) at\n\n         Bangalore. On the intervening night between 05.03.1993 and\n\n         06.03.1993, the appellant-accused while on duty committed\n\n         theft of a registered insured parcel bearing receipt No. 0127\n\n         dated 03.03.1993 containing Gold Chain (V shape) weighing\n\n         173.650 Grams worth Rs. 70,410/- which was sent by its\n\n         owner from Ramavadi Post Office, Bombay for being delivered\n\n         to the consignee - Gulab Jewellery Shop at K.H.B.

The\n\n         complaint           was        accordingly           investigated   which   revealed\n\n         complicity of the appellant in commission of its theft which\n\n         led to registration of Crime Case No. 115/1993 against the\n\n         appellant for the offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/436339/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 381</a> and\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/1667388/\" id=\"a_7\">419</a> of IPC read with Section 52 of the IPO Act.

The CBI registered the case\n\n         being RC No. 14(S)/93-BLR, which eventually led to filing of\n\n         the charge-sheet against the appellant in the Court of XVII\n\n         Additional Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, Bangalore                              for\n\n         appellant’s prosecution for commission of aforementioned\n\n         offences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">         6.

Similarly, the appellant was also\n\n         sentenced to undergo simple imprisonment for 6 months and\n\n         to pay a fine of Rs. 2000/- for the offence punishable under\n\n         Section 52 of the IPO Act and in default of payment of fine\n\n         amount, to undergo further simple imprisonment of 3\n\n         months. So far as the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1667388/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 419</a>\n\n         IPC was concerned, the appellant was acquitted of the charge.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">         7.        It may be pertinent to mention that the Chief Judicial\n\n         Magistrate while awarding the punishment for commission of\n\n         two offences as mentioned above did not mention as to\n\n         whether both the punishments will run “concurrently” or\n\n         “consecutively”. In other words, the order of the Chief\n\n         Judicial Magistrate in so far as it relates to the award of\n\n         punishment was concerned it was silent, on this issue.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">         8.

The High Court,\n\n         by        impugned           order,         dismissed      the   revision    and    in\n\n         consequence upheld the conviction and sentences awarded to\n\n         the appellant. It is against this order, the appellant- accused\n\n         has filed this appeal by way of special leave.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">         9.        While assailing the legality and correctness of the\n\n         impugned order, learned Counsel for the appellant urged only\n\n         one point. Learned Counsel, however, did not question the\n\n         legality and correctness of the conviction on its merit and\n\n         confined his challenge only to the sentences awarded to the\n\n         appellant. According to him, the Courts below erred in not\n\n         directing both the sentences awarded to the appellant, i.e.,\n\n         the one awarded under <a href=\"/doc/436339/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 381</a> IPC and the other\n\n         awarded           under         Section          52   of   the   IPO   Act   to    run\n\n         &quot;concurrently&quot;.                It was his submission that since both the\n\n         offences which resulted in appellant&#x27;s conviction under two\n\n         different Acts (IPC and IPO Act) were tried in one trial and\n\n         arose out of one act namely- &quot;theft&quot;, this was a fit case where\n\n         the Courts below should have directed both the sentences to\n\n         run &quot;concurrently&quot;.                    Learned Counsel pointed out that in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">PAGE NO. 5 OF 13</span>\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 104 OF 2015 @ SLP(CRL) No. 7551 of 2014\n\n\n         every case of this nature, it is the duty of the Court to\n\n         specifically mention in the order of conviction as to whether\n\n         the sentences awarded for the offences under the different\n\n         sections would run “concurrently” or “consecutively” by\n\n         taking recourse to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1494432/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 31</a> of the Code of\n\n         Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as “the\n\n         Code”). Learned Counsel contended that in any event, having\n\n         regard to the nature of offence committed by the appellant,\n\n         his advanced age (61 years),                         the serious heart ailment\n\n         suffered by him while undergoing the sentence duly proved by\n\n         documents and the fact that he has already been dismissed\n\n         from service due to his conviction, this Court should invoke\n\n         the power under <a href=\"/doc/171008987/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 31</a> of the Code and direct both the\n\n         sentences, i.e., the one awarded under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_14\">IPC</a> and other awarded\n\n         under IPO Act to run                          &quot;concurrently&quot; instead of to run\n\n         &quot;consecutively&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">         10. In contra, learned counsel for the respondent- State\n\n         supported the impugned judgment and submitted that no\n\n         interference is called for in the impugned judgment.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">         11. Having heard the learned counsel for the parties and on\n\n         perusal of the record of the case, we find force in the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">PAGE NO. 6 OF 13</span>\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 104 OF 2015 @ SLP(CRL) No. 7551 of 2014\n\n\n         submissions made by the learned counsel for the appellant.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">         12. The question, which arises for consideration in this\n\n         appeal, is whether the sentences awarded to the appellant\n\n         under IPC and the IPO Act should run &quot;concurrently&quot; or\n\n         &quot;consecutively”?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">         13. The expressions “concurrently” and                        “consecutively”\n\n         mentioned in the Code                        are of immense significance while\n\n         awarding punishment to the accused once he is found guilty\n\n         of any offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">IPC</a> or/and of an offence\n\n         punishable under any other <a href=\"/doc/701797/\" id=\"a_16\">Special Act</a> arising out of one\n\n         trial or more. It is for the reason that award of former enure\n\n         to the benefit of accused whereas award of latter is\n\n         detrimental to the accused’s interest. It is, therefore, legally\n\n         obligatory upon the Court of first instance while awarding\n\n         sentence to specify in clear terms in the order of conviction as\n\n         to whether sentence awarded to the accused would run\n\n         “concurrently” or they would run “consecutively”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">         14. <a href=\"/doc/171008987/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 31</a> of the Code deals with power of the Court to\n\n         award sentence in cases where the accused is convicted of\n\n         several offences at one trial.

If a given transaction constitutes two\n                    offences under two enactments generally, it is wrong to\n                    have consecutive sentences.
