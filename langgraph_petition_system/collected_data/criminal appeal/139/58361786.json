Thus, from the above mentioned circumstances which\nhave emerged after appreciation of prosecution evidence, this\nCourt is of the considered opinion, that in fact the prosecution\nhas miserably failed in establishing the guilt of the appellant\nno. 2 Bhure and appellant no.3 Shripal, beyond any reasonable\ndoubt. However, it is unfortunate, that these aspects were not\nnoticed by the Trial Court also and the appellant no.2 Bhure @\nBalram Jatav and appellant no.3 Shripal were convicted for\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1374258/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 364-A</a> of I.P.C. and under Section 11/13\nof M.P.D.V.P.K.

According to the certificate issued by the Trial Court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/914361/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 428</a> of Cr.P.C., the appellant no.3 Shripal is in\njail from 5-7-2003 whereas         during trial, the appellant no.2\nBhure @ Balram Jatav had remained in jail from 9-4-2003 to\n14-10-2003 and after his conviction by the Trial Court, he was\ngranted bail by this Court by order dated 26-3-2015. Thus, it\nis clear that appellant no.3 Shripal has remained in jail for a\nperiod of near about 15 years, whereas appellant no.2 Bhure\n@ Balram Jatav has remained in jail for a period of near about\n12 years, and now this Court has come to a conclusion that\nthe appellant no.2 and no.3 were falsely implicated.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">19. Consequently,      it   is   held   that   the   prosecution    has\nmiserably failed in establishing the guilt of the appellant no. 2\nBhure and appellant no. 3 Shripal and thus, they are acquitted\nof all the charges.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">20. Accordingly, the        judgment and sentence dated 8-6-\n2004, passed by Special Judge (M.P.D.V.P.K.

His\nbail bonds and surety bonds stand discharged. The appellant\nno.3 Shripal is in jail. He be released immediately, if not\nrequired in any other case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">22. However, before parting with this judgment, this Court\nwould like to take note of a disturbing feature of this case. As\nalready held, the appellant no.2 Bhure @ Balram Jatav, has\nremained in jail for a period of near about 12 years and\nappellant no.3 Shripal is in jail for the last near about 15\nyears. It is unfortunate, that there is no provision under the\nLaw to compensate the victim of false/malicious implication,\nafter his acquittal in the Trial or in an appeal. However, this\nCourt cannot lose sight of the fact, that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution of India, protects the life and liberty of the citizen\n                                       14         Criminal Appeal No.460/2004\n       [Santosh Kumar Dohare (dead), Bhure and another Vs.

In the facts and\n           circumstances of the case, we feel that a\n           sum of Rs.2,00,000/- (Rupees Two Lacs)\n           would be an adequate compensation for\n           the appellant and would meet the ends\n           of justice. We, accordingly, direct the\n           State of Madhya Pradesh to pay to the\n           appellant the sum of Rs.2,00,000/-\n           (Rupees Two Lacs) as compensation. In\n           case the sum of Rs.70,000/- as awarded\n           by the High Court, has already been paid\n           to the appellant, the State would\n           naturally pay only the balance amount of\n           Rs.1,30,000/- (Rupees One Lac thirty\n           thousand).&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">26. The Supreme Court in the case of Anita Thakur Vs.\nState of J&amp;K reported in (2016) 15 SCC 525 has held as\nunder :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">           &quot;It is apparent that to that extent, the\n           respondents misused their power. To that\n           extent,   fundamental    right  of   the\n                                    18         Criminal Appeal No.460/2004\n    [Santosh Kumar Dohare (dead), Bhure and another Vs. State of M.P.]\n\n           petitioners, due to police excess, has\n           been violated. In such circumstances, in\n           exercise of its power under <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 32</a> of\n           the Constitution, this Court can award\n           compensation to the petitioners. (See\n           Saheli v. Commr. of Police, (1990) 1 SCC\n           422, Joginder Kaur v. Punjab State [1969\n           ACJ     28],   State     of   Rajasthan    v.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">           Vidhyawati [1962 Supp (2) SCR 989 ]\n           and Nilabati Behera v. State of Orissa\n           [(1993) 2 SCC 746].) The ratio of these\n           precedents can be explained thus: First,\n           it is clear that a violation of fundamental\n           rights due to police misconduct can give\n           rise to a liability under public law, apart\n           from criminal and tort law. Secondly, that\n           pecuniary compensation can be awarded\n           for such a violation of fundamental\n           rights. Thirdly, it is the State that is held\n           liable and, therefore, the compensation is\n           borne by the State and not the individual\n           police officers found guilty of misconduct.\n           Fourthly, this Court has held that the\n           standard of proof required for proving\n           police misconduct such as brutality,\n           torture and custodial violence and for\n           holding the State accountable for the\n           same, is high. It is only for patent and\n           incontrovertible violation of fundamental\n           rights that such remedy can be made\n           available.    Fifthly,   the   doctrine    of\n           sovereign immunity does not apply to\n           cases of fundamental rights violation and\n           hence, cannot be used as a defence in\n           public law.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">27. Thus, it is clear that where a person has not remained in\nincarceration   for   a   longer   time,    then   the   quantum      of\ncompensation amount would be on a lesser side but where a\nperson has remained in jail for a period of more than 12 years\nor if a person is still in jail i.e., for more than 15 years, then\nfor violation of fundamental rights of the accused, the State\nmust compensate the victim. The Supreme Court in the case\nof Anita Thakur (Supra) has also held that for patent and\n                                        19         Criminal Appeal No.460/2004\n        [Santosh Kumar Dohare (dead), Bhure and another Vs. State of M.P.]\n\n   incontrovertible violation of fundamental rights, the remedy of\n   compensating the victim of police misconduct, is available.\n   Thus, it is held that as it has been found that the appellant\n   was prosecuted with deliberate and malafide intention, so that\n   the complainant may settle his          scores, and the police also\n   joined hands with the complainant so that it can gain\n   popularity   by    fake   and     imaginary     encounters              with    the\n   miscreants, then the State must compensate the appellants\n   for the utter violation of their fundamental rights as for no\n   reason, they were compelled to remain in jail for such a long\n   time.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">   28. The next question is that what would be the just and\n   proper compensation under the facts and circumstances of the\n   case. For adjudicating the just and proper compensation, the\n   appellants would be required to file a civil suit in order to\n   establish the actual loss sustained by them, because of\n   malicious    prosecution.         However,    for        utter    violation      of\n   fundamental right of right and liberty, the State should\n   compensate      the   sufferer,    therefore,       it    is     held    that    a\n   compensation of Rs. 3 Lakhs to each of the appellant i.e.,\n   appellant no.2 Bhure @ Balram Jatav @ Balram Jatav and\n   appellant no.3 Shripal, shall be payable by the State, within 3\n   months from today. This compensation amount, shall be liable\n   to be adjusted, in case if the civil suit for damages is filed.\n   The State may recover the amount from the erring persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">   29.
