The present matter in which the order of reference has been made, has\n\nbeen filed as a Criminal Appeal under <a href=\"/doc/13406485/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 14-A(1)</a> of the Scheduled\n\nCastes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (for short\n\n&quot;the Atrocities Act&quot;) against the order dated 23.07.2020 passed by Special\n\nJudge, Atrocities Act, Seoni in SC ATR No.08/2020. In fact, earlier appeal\n\nfiled by appellant viz. Criminal Appeal No.10267/2019, was dismissed as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                        [3]</span>\n\n                                                     Criminal Appeal No.5189/2020\n\n\n\nwithdrawn vide order dated 10.12.2019 with liberty to him to file afresh\n\nappeal after recording of the statement of the prosecutrix.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.    The facts of the case in brief are that the police station Keolari, District\n\nSeoni registered Crime No.314/2019 against the accused/appellant for offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_16\">Sections 363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/796352/\" id=\"a_17\">366</a>, <a href=\"/doc/16342935/\" id=\"a_18\">376(2)(n)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/23642035/\" id=\"a_19\">376(3)</a> of IPC, <a href=\"/doc/153588598/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 5(L)</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_21\">6</a> of Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (for short\n\n&quot;the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_22\">POCSO Act</a>&quot;) and Section 3(1)(w)(i), 3(2)(va) and 3(2)(v) of Atrocities\n\nAct on the allegation that he abducted the minor prosecutrix and took her to\n\nNagpur where he sexually exploited her on the pretext of marriage. During the\n\ncourse of investigation, the accused/appellant was arrested on 22.10.2019. He\n\nfiled an application under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 439</a> Cr.P.C. for grant of bail which was\n\nrejected by the Special Judge, Atrocities Act, Seoni vide order dated\n\n23.07.2020. Aggrieved thereby, he filed the earlier appeal viz. CRA\n\nNo.10267/2019, which was dismissed as withdrawn vide order dated\n\n10.12.2019 with liberty to file afresh after recording of the statement of\n\nprosecutrix. Thereafter the trial Court recorded the statement of prosecutrix\n\nwherein she did not support the prosecution story and deposed that appellant\n\ndid not commit rape with her. This paved the way for the accused/appellant to\n\nfile second appeal on the same subject matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"68297532\" id=\"span_4\">4.    In the course of argument of appeal before the Single Bench, an\n\nobjection was raised by the learned Public Prosecutor that since the accused is\n\nalso being tried for offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/153588598/\" id=\"a_24\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/183539218/\" id=\"a_25\">6</a> of the POCSO\n\nAct, therefore, he should have filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 439</a> of\n\nCr.P.C. before this Court rather than filing appeal. It was argued that when the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                           [4]</span>\n\n                                                          Criminal Appeal No.5189/2020\n\n\n\naccused is being tried for offences of <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_27\">POCSO Act</a> as well as for offences\n\nunder the Atrocities Act, such trial should be conducted by the Special Judge\n\nnotified for trial of the cases registered under <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_28\">POCSO Act</a>, whereas, in the\n\npresent case, the trial is being conducted by the Special Judge notified for trial\n\nof the cases registered under the Atrocities Act. It was therefore argued that\n\nthe trial against the accused stood vitiated and a direction be issued to transfer\n\nthis case to the court of Special Judge notified for trial of the cases under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_29\">POCSO Act</a>. Reliance was placed on the Single Bench judgment of this Court\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/68297532/\" id=\"a_30\">Smt. Sunita Gandharva</a> (supra).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"27418822\" id=\"span_6\">5.    Learned counsel for the accused/appellant contested the aforesaid\n\nobjection and submitted that there was nothing objectionable even if the trial\n\nof the case involving offences of both POSCO Act as well as Atrocities Act\n\nwas being conducted by the Special Court notified for trial of the offences\n\nunder the latter Act. Since the application filed by the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_31\">Section\n\n439</a> of Cr.P.C. was dismissed by the Special Judge notified under the\n\nAtrocities Act, an appeal against such order would lie to this Court under\n\nSection 14 of the Atrocities Act. Reliance in support of this argument was\n\nplaced on the judgment of Single Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/27418822/\" id=\"a_32\">Mohd. Juned</a>\n\n(supra).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">6.    The learned Single Judge in view of the conflicting views expressed by\n\ntwo Single Benches of this Court, referred the matter to Larger Bench, in this\n\ncase the Division Bench, on the following questions:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             &quot;(i)    Which court shall conduct the trial of a case, instituted\n             under penal provision of two Special Acts i.e. the Atrocities Act as\n             well as the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_33\">POCSO Act</a>, either the Special Court constituted under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                           [5]</span>\n\n                                                          Criminal Appeal No.5189/2020\n\n\n             Atrocities Act or the Special Court constituted under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_34\">POCSO\n             Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">             (ii)    Whether an Appeal against an order of rejection of bail of\n             an accused by the Special Court, in a case instituted for committing\n             offences under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_35\">POCSO Act &amp; the Atrocities Act</a>, shall lie\n             under the provisions of Section 14-A of the Atrocities Act or\n             application under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 438</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_37\">439</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure,\n             as the case may be.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">7.

Shri Rakesh Kumar Sharma, learned Senior Advocate submitted that\n\nthere is no conflict between the two judgments passed by the Single Benches\n\nof this Court in <a href=\"/doc/27418822/\" id=\"a_38\">Mohd. Juned</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/68297532/\" id=\"a_39\">Smt. Sunita Gandharva</a> (supra).\n\nThe ratio of both the judgments is that the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_40\">POCSO Act</a> being the latter Act, its\n\nprovisions would prevail over those of the Atrocities Act.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1575265\" id=\"span_10\">In both the\n\njudgments, the learned Single Judges of this Court have relied on the\n\nauthoritative enunciations of law by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1575265/\" id=\"a_41\">Sarwan Singh\n\nand another vs. Kasturi Lal</a>, AIR 1977 SC 265 holding that the latter\n\nenactment must prevail over the earlier one. It is argued by the learned Senior\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                             [6]</span>\n\n                                                          Criminal Appeal No.5189/2020\n\n\n\nCounsel that both the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_42\">POCSO Act and Atrocities Act</a> contain non-obstante\n\nclauses regarding applicability of various provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_43\">Cr.P.C</a>. The Special\n\nCourts have been constituted under both the enactments for the purpose of\n\ntaking cognizance, conducting trials etc. However, in Atrocities Act, the\n\napplication for bail is filed under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C. before the Special\n\nCourt and if the same is refused or allowed then the remedy would be to file\n\nan appeal under Section 14-A(2) of the Atrocities Act before this Court. But\n\nthere is no such appeal provided under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_45\">POCSO Act</a> and in such an\n\neventuality, the regular bail application under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C. has to be\n\nfiled. The learned Senior Counsel in support of his arguments has placed\n\nreliance on the following judgments:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      (i)       In Re.: Registrar (Judicial) High Court, Madras, 2017 Cri.L.J. 4519\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      (ii)      State of Andhra Pradesh vs. Mangali Yadagiri, 2016 Cri.L.J. 1415\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      (iii)     Guddu Kumar Yadav vs. The State of Bihar, Cr.

Another test that is applied is that the latter enactment\n\nnormally prevails over the earlier one. It is argued that the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_54\">POCSO Act</a> has\n\nmuch wider scope and has a detailed procedure which is evident from the\n\nprovisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/25516219/\" id=\"a_55\">Sections 19</a> to <a href=\"/doc/151175657/\" id=\"a_56\">27</a> of the POCSO Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">11.   Shri Pushpendra Yadav, learned Additional Advocate General argued\n\nthat the Atrocities Act was enacted in 1989 to prevent the commission of\n\noffence of atrocities against the member of Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\n\nTribes with a non-obstante clause giving overriding effect on other laws. <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_57\">The\n\nPOCSO Act</a> was enacted in the year 2012 with an object to provide protection\n\nto the children from sexual offences which also contains the non-obstante\n\nclause having overriding effect to the other inconsistent laws. The learned\n\nAdditional Advocate General submits that where there are two special statutes\n\ncontaining non-obstante clauses, the latter statute must prevail. This is because\n\nat the time of enactment of the latter statute, the legislature is presumed to be\n\naware about the earlier legislation and its non-obstante clause. If the\n\nlegislature still confers the latter enactment with a non-obstante clause, it\n\nmeans that the legislature wanted that enactment to prevail. If the legislature\n\nwould not want the latter enactment to prevail, then it could provide in the\n\nlatter enactment that the provisions of the earlier enactment continue to apply.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"885483\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"261773\" id=\"span_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"965356\" id=\"span_21\">In support of his argument, learned Additional Advocate General has placed\n\nreliance on <a href=\"/doc/965356/\" id=\"a_58\">Solidare India Pvt.

Section 353 defines\n\njudgment passed in Criminal Trial. Section 362 prescribes that no court, when\n\nit has signed its judgment or final order disposing of a case, shall alter or\n\nreview the same except to correct a clerical or arithmetical error whereas\n\nSection 439 talks about special power of the High Court and Sessions Court\n\nfor grant of bail. Section 439(1) confers the power to grant the bail on certain\n\nconditions and Section 439(2) confers the power to cancel the bail. Therefore,\n\nSection 362 cannot restrict the power of the High Court under Section 439(2)\n\nto cancel the bail granted. The law in this respect has been correctly laid down\n\nby this Court in <a href=\"/doc/68297532/\" id=\"a_62\">Smt.

Another argument that was examined by the learned Single Judge in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/27418822/\" id=\"a_81\">Mohd. Juned</a> (supra) was that challan in cases involving <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_82\">POCSO Act</a> has to\n\nbe filed before the Special Court notified under that Act whereas for offences\n\nunder the Atrocities Act the trial of the case has to be made over to the Special\n\nCourt after committal by the Chief Judicial Magistrate. It was noted that in\n\nthat particular case the challan was filed before the Sessions Court, therefore,\n\nit would affect the right of the applicant. Referring to <a href=\"/doc/1145599/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 193</a> of Cr.P.C.,\n\nit was observed that except as otherwise expressly provided by this Code or\n\nby any other law for the time being in force, no Court of Session shall take\n\ncognizance of any offence as a Court of original jurisdiction unless the case\n\nhas been committed to it by the Magistrate under the Code. Since <a href=\"/doc/27418822/\" id=\"a_84\">in that case</a>\n\nthe offences of <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_85\">POCSO Act, Atrocities Act</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_86\">IPC</a> were involved but the\n\nchallan was filed before the Court of Session, therefore, the challan filed\n\nbefore the Court of Session cannot be said to be prejudicial to the interest of\n\nthe applicant, held the Court.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"146351380\" id=\"span_37\">Relying on the judgment of Supreme Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/146351380/\" id=\"a_87\">Rattiram &amp; others vs. State of M.P.</a>, (2012) 4 SCC 516, the learned Single\n\nJudge noted that the Supreme Court <a href=\"/doc/146351380/\" id=\"a_88\">in that case</a> reversed the judgment of this\n\nCourt and held that mere filing of challan before the Session Court would not\n\namount to illegality and the trial would not vitiate for non-observance of\n\nSection 193 of the Code. It was held that until and unless the prejudice is\n\nshown and established by the accused, mere filing of the challan before the\n\nCourt of Sessions, does not amount to illegality.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"27418822\" id=\"span_38\">In those facts, it was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                       [12]</span>\n\n                                                    Criminal Appeal No.5189/2020\n\n\n\nobserved by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/27418822/\" id=\"a_89\">Mohd. Juned</a> (supra) that considering the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_90\">Atrocities Act, POCSO Act</a> as well as <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_91\">Cr.P.C</a>., it is apparent that\n\nthe offence registered under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_92\">POCSO Act</a> shall be tried by the Court\n\nnotified under <a href=\"/doc/144724096/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 25</a> of the Commissions for <a href=\"/doc/506243/\" id=\"a_94\">Protection of Child Rights\n\nAct, 2005</a>, which shall be deemed to be the &quot;Children&#x27;s Court&quot; as per the\n\nproviso to <a href=\"/doc/194699880/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 28</a> of the POCSO Act. Simultaneously, if the offence\n\nregistered under the provisions of the Atrocities Act, then such offences shall\n\nbe tried by the Special Court notified to try the said offence by Session Judge\n\nposted in the said Court from the date of assuming the offence. If the offences\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_96\">IPC</a> are also involved with respect to the offences of the respective special\n\nenactments, then those offences shall also be tried by the said Special Court\n\nnotified under the respective enactments. It was further held that in a same\n\ncrime number if the offences have been registered under the provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_97\">Atrocities Act and POCSO Act</a>, then such offences shall be tried by a Court of\n\nSession notified under the Atrocities Act with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/811293/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 9</a> of Cr.P.C.\n\nand as per the language of the notifications. In such circumstances, trial of the\n\noffences involved under both the Acts is not required to be split up. But at the\n\nsame time, the learned Single Judge further made it clear that in case of any\n\ninconsistency, the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_99\">POCSO Act</a> being latter enactment shall prevail over the\n\nprovisions of the Atrocities Act.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"146351380\" id=\"span_40\">However, mere filing of challan before the\n\nSessions Court would not vitiate the trial ipso facto in view of the judgment of\n\nthe Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/146351380/\" id=\"a_100\">Rattiram</a> (supra).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"68297532\" id=\"span_41\">16.   <a href=\"/doc/68297532/\" id=\"a_101\">Smt.

Beside that, statement of objects and reasons of <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_122\">POCSO\n           Act and Atrocities Act</a> are to be seen, wherein, although both the\n           statutes are dedicated to serve the interest of a special class of\n           citizens but the legislative priority or preference appears to be in\n           favour of the child because, if, Chapters V,VI, VIII and IX of\n           POCSO Act and its different provisions are seen in tandem then it\n           reveals that legislature intended to give delicate and protected\n           treatment to the victim under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_123\">POCSO Act</a> and special care of\n           children as victims of crime have been designed to go through the\n           process of investigation and trial of the accused. It applies\n           irrespective of social or economic background of a child, therefore,\n           welfare of children transcending all barriers of caste and creed and\n           because of its all pervasive nature, <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_124\">POCSO Act</a> is having\n           overriding effect over the Atrocities Act.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                              [15]</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                                              Criminal Appeal No.5189/2020\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">43.     It is to be remembered that <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_125\">POCSO Act</a> has much wider\nscope so far as victims are concerned because <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_126\">POCSO Act</a> is an act\nto protect Children from sexual offences, sexual harassment and\npornography and provide for establishment of special Court for\ntrial of such offences and for matters connected therewith or\nincidental thereto, therefore, ambit and scope of <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_127\">POCSO Act</a>\nappears to be much wider than the Atrocities Act. Even otherwise,\nChild being considered the father of man is a biological\nevolution/phenomenon; whereas, Caste has a social/customary\nconnotation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">44.    One more facet of the controversy deserves attention is\n<a href=\"/doc/154215911/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 28 (2)</a> of the POCSO Act by which Special Court under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_129\">POCSO Act</a> has been bestowed with the authority to try an\naccused for an offence other than the offence referred to in\nsubsection (1) of <a href=\"/doc/194699880/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 28</a>. Meaning thereby that <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_131\">Special Court,\nPOCSO Act</a> can try for offence under other enactments also with\nwhich the accused may under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_132\">Cr.P.C</a>. be charged; whereas, no\nsuch analogous provision for such inclusion exists in Atrocities\nAct, therefore, on this Count also, legislative intent and rule of\nharmonious construction weigh in favour of <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_133\">POCSO Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">45.     <a href=\"/doc/184812241/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 31</a> of the POCSO Act can also be profitably\nreferred in this regard:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       &quot;31.

Therefore,\n<a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C. is impliedly included by such provision and\ntherefore, against the order of <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_138\">Special Court (POCSO Act</a>),\napplication under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 439</a> of Cr.P.C. for bail shall be\nmaintainable instead of appeal under Section 14-A (2) of the\nAtrocities Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">46.     Another principle for guidance in relation to non-obstante\nclause in two legislations would be the settled principle that both\nstatutes have to be harmoniously construed as far as possible.\nTaking the cue from such principle, if both the Acts are taken into\nconsideration where Special Protection, Remedies and Speedy\nTrial have been contemplated, it appears that <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_140\">POCSO Act</a> is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                          [16]</span>\n\n                                                         Criminal Appeal No.5189/2020\n\n\n            designed to a wider range of victims than the Atrocities Act. Since\n            the procedure has been specifically provided, children of whatever\n            background including the background from Scheduled Castes or\n            Scheduled Tribes, process of investigation and trial of the accused\n            meanders through different specifically enacted provisions while\n            taking into consideration the delicate mind of a child victim, his\n            probable subjugation to secondary victimization and procedural\n            safeguards appear to be extensively incorporated in the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_141\">POCSO\n            Act</a>, but not in Atrocities Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">            47.    In fact, a Special Court under the Atrocities Act does not\n            have the kind of infrastructure, procedure, staff and training as\n            contemplated in different provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_142\">POCSO Act</a>, specially\n            <a href=\"/doc/25370054/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 33</a> to <a href=\"/doc/141711346/\" id=\"a_144\">38</a> of the POCSO Act, therefore, on this count also,\n            harmonious construction and reconciliation between the two\n            enactments would be achieved when <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_145\">POCSO Act</a> given\n            precedence over the Atrocities Act in case a Child suffers and\n            when he belongs to a Scheduled Caste or Scheduled Tribe\n            Community.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"68297532\" id=\"span_50\">17.

Speaking generally, the object and purpose of a legislation\n            assume greater relevance if the language of the law is obscure and\n            ambiguous.

When two or\n            more laws operate in the same field and each contains a non-\n            obstante clause stating that its provisions will over-ride those of\n            any other law, stimulating and incisive problems of interpretation\n            arise.

The legislature gave overriding effect to Section 14-A and\n             Chapter III-A with the knowledge that <a href=\"/doc/843823/\" id=\"a_177\">Sections 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/558518/\" id=\"a_178\">39</a> of the\n             Slum Clearance Act contained non-obstante clauses of equal\n             efficacy. Therefore the later enactment must prevail over the\n             former. The same test was mentioned with approval by this Court\n             in <a href=\"/doc/1199724/\" id=\"a_179\">Shri Ram Narain</a>&#x27;s case at p. 615.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"885483\" id=\"span_60\">20.

The\n            Courts would also try to reconcile both Acts by adopting\n            harmonious interpretation and applying them in their respective\n            fields so that both may operate without coming into conflict with\n            each other. In resolving the clash, the Court may further examine\n            whether one of the two enactments is &quot;special&quot; and the other one is\n            &quot;general&quot;. There can also be a situation in law where one and the\n            same statute may be held to be a &quot;special&quot; statute vis-a`-vis one\n            legislation and &quot;general&quot; statute vis-à-vis another legislation. On\n            the basis of one or more tests, the Court will try to salvage the\n            situation by giving effect to non obstante clause in both the\n            legislations.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">21.

Conflict of jurisdiction between two special Acts operating\n             in the same field, both carrying non obstante clauses, is not a new\n             phenomenon to confront courts. When the question does arise as to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                               [22]</span>\n\n                                                Criminal Appeal No.5189/2020\n\n\nwhich special statute would prevail generally, or over a certain part\nof the rights and liabilities regulated, the procedure or jurisdiction\nprovided, there are no thumb rules to determine the conflict. There\nare, however, well settled principles for guidance to be applied in\nsuch situations, in order to resolve which of the two special\nenactments would prevail. The first and the more pervasive of the\nprinciples to be applied, is to look to the object and the purpose of\nthe enactments that operate in the same field. Here, it has to be the\nendeavor of the Court to find out the legislative priority. It has to\nbe discerned by the Court where in the compete and conflict\nbetween two special statutes, the legislative priority lies. This\nconflict can arise between two provisions of the same statute, and\nthat is why it is commonplace to come across statutory\nphraseology that seeks to obviate the conflict by wording the non\nobstante clause in one of the two provisions in the same statute\nsaying, &quot;notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other law for\nthe time being in force .....&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">15.     The test of looking to the object of the two special statutes\nto determine which of the two would prevail, in cases where there\nis a conflict between the two, is the more enduring one to guide.\nThe other that is invariably applied, or may be alongside the first,\nis to see which of the two special statutes, both carrying non\nobstante clauses was enacted subsequent in point of time. It is a\ndependable principle that a subsequent legislation is enacted by the\nlegislature with knowledge of the provisions of the earlier special\nstatute. Thus, it is presumed that if a subsequent statute gives\noverriding effect to a particular provision, that impinges upon the\nfield occupied by an existing special statute, the legislature is\npresumed to have intended the subsequent enactment to take\nprecedence over the former. But, it may not be always so. There\nthe wider tests relating to the objects of the two legislations is to be\napplied alongside, in order to arrive at a construction that resolves\nthe conflict, giving fullest effect to the legislative intent.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">16.

The learned counsel appearing for the applicants\nhave relied heavily upon the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/154215911/\" id=\"a_200\">Section 28(2)</a> of the\nPOCSO Act, to submit that the Court constituted under the said\nstatute is invested with exclusive jurisdiction to try offences, other\nthan those under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_201\">POCSO Act</a>, about which provision is made\nunder <a href=\"/doc/94761861/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 28(1)</a> of the said Act, wherever the accused may be\ncharged under the Code with such offences, at the same trial.

The powers of granting bail by the High\n            Court under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_208\">section 439</a> of the Cr.P.C. will not get diluted even\n            after the special court has exercised such powers. Once it is\n            established that the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_209\">POCSO Act</a> will have overriding effect on the\n            Atrocity Act, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/184812241/\" id=\"a_210\">section 31</a> of the POCSO Act will\n            come into play which speaks of applicability of the provisions of\n            <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_211\">Cr.P.C</a>. The same declares that the Special Court shall be deemed\n            to be a Sessions Court, whereas such deeming fiction is\n            conspicuously absent in section 14 of the Atrocity Act. <a href=\"/doc/25370054/\" id=\"a_212\">Section 33</a>\n            of the POCSO Act mandates the procedure for safeguarding the\n            interest of the child during the trial proceedings. Thus, the\n            comparative analysis of provisions of both the Acts, leads to sole\n            conclusion, that the legislature in its wisdom has conferred\n            precedence on the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_213\">POCSO Act</a> above the Atrocity Act. Hence, the\n            only remedy available for the applicant will be of filing an\n            application under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_214\">section 439</a> of the Cr.P.C. before the High Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">            13.

With regard to the\n            judgement of the Patna High Court, it appears that while\n            considering the provision of section 14-A of the Atrocity Act, the\n            Court was invited the attention to the date of Amendment\n            Act which was promulgated subsequent in 2015 after the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_218\">POCSO\n            Act</a>. However, I am in complete agreement with the final opinion\n            expressed by the Patna High Court with regard to the\n            maintainability of an application for bail in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_219\">section 439</a> of\n            the Cr.P.C. in a case involving the POCSO Act and the Atrocity\n            Act.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">26.   The Bombay High Court in Suraj S.

S.T. Act, the provision of the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_220\">POCSO Act</a> will prevail. The trial\n\nof the case will also be done by Special Court constituted under <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_221\">POCSO Act</a>.\n\nSimilarly, the Rajasthan High Court in Lokesh Kumar Jangid (supra) also\n\nheld that no appeal will lie in a composite offence of POCSO and SC ST Act\n\nand a regular bail application under Section 439 would be maintainable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">27.   The Chhattisgarh High Court in Ram Swarup Rajwade (supra) on\n\nthis aspect of the matter had the following observations to make in para 40\n\nand 41 of the report:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">             &quot;40. A careful perusal of <a href=\"/doc/154215911/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 28(2)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/184812241/\" id=\"a_223\">Sections 31</a>\n             and <a href=\"/doc/136804760/\" id=\"a_224\">42A</a> of the POCSO Act read with <a href=\"/doc/188158185/\" id=\"a_225\">Sections 26</a> and 220 of the\n             Code of 1973, would reveal that it makes the path for operation /\n             provisions of other laws particularly the trial of offences under the\n             provisions of other law if the accused is charged at the same trial.\n             In other words, the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_226\">POCSO Act</a> harmoniously allows the\n             incorporation of other Acts for their operation by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/154215911/\" id=\"a_227\">Section\n             28(2)</a> of the POCSO Act. In this regard, there is neither any\n             inconsistency nor any conflict in the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_228\">POCSO Act</a> and as such, the\n             SC-ST Act of 1989 and the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_229\">POCSO Act</a> can co-exist and stand\n             independently together with each other for operational purpose and\n             as such, &quot;Special Court&quot; designated under the <a href=\"/doc/103108231/\" id=\"a_230\">POCSO Act</a> would\n             have exclusive jurisdiction to try the offence of both the Acts if\n             arise out of same crime in one incident.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">             41.     Similarly, it is well settled position of law that if two Acts\n             operate in the same field then the Act which is later enacted will\n             prevail over the earlier one. This legal principle is based on the\n             foundation that at the time of enactment of the later statute, the\n             Legislature was well aware of the earlier legislation and its non\n             obstante clause. Since the Legislature still confers the later\n             enactment with a non obstante clause, it means that the Legislature\n             wanted that enactment to prevail.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">28.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"27418822\" id=\"span_69\">In view of the above, it must be held that &quot;even though the learned\n\nSingle Judge in last para of the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/27418822/\" id=\"a_231\">Mohd.
