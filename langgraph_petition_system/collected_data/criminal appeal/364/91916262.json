Injury No. 10 could prove dangerous to\n\nlife. As per the Forensic Science Laboratory reports Ex. PD and\n\nEx. PJ, the pistols recovered from the accused were in working\n\ncondition and they had been fired through.        Pellets and wads\n\nrecovered from the dead body of Parveen were opined to be of 12\n\nbore cartridge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">               The present case rests on eye witness account. So far\n\nas injured Arvind is concerned, his presence at the spot cannot\n\nbe doubted as he had himself suffered injuries in the occurrence\n\nand he is the son of deceased Karambir. Although the statement\n\nof the said witness was recorded on 10.8.2004 but that fact in\n\nitself cannot be said to be fatal to the prosecution case as the FIR\n\nin the present case was lodged immediately after the occurrence\n\non the basis of the statement of complainant Hari Ram.\n\nMoreover, the fact that the statement of injured eye witness\n\nArvind has been recorded after some delay by the investigating\n\nagency cannot be made a ground to disbelieve his statement.\n\nThe lapse on the part of the investigating officer cannot be said to\n\nbe fatal to the prosecution case which is otherwise duly\n\nestablished. PW-2 Arvind has withstood the test of cross\n\nexamination and his statement qua the manner of occurrence\n\ncould not be shaken. Complainant Hari Ram had informed the\n\npolice qua the occurrence and Sub Inspector Rattan Singh had\n\nreached the spot along with other police officials and statement\n\nof Hari Ram complainant was recorded at 11.30 A.M. Hari Ram\n\nis resident of village Gawalra where the occurrence had taken\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\"> Crl.

Both Hari\n\nRam as well as injured Arvind have deposed in a natural manner\n\nand their statements inspire confidence. The fact that Hari Ram\n\nhas not suffered any injury in the occurrence is not sufficient to\n\ndisbelieve his testimony. All the accused had come to the spot to\n\nthe house of Karambir armed with deadly weapons with a view to\n\ncommit the crime. The assailants had no ill will against PW-1\n\nand had not caused any injury to him. The ocular version is duly\n\ncorroborated by medical evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">               The     argument      of   the   learned   counsel   for   the\n\nappellants that the assailants had no motive to commit the crime\n\nis liable to be rejected as the eye witnesses have categorically\n\ndeposed that some property dispute was pending between Partap\n\nSingh and deceased Karambir.               Karambir is the son of Bichha\n\nfrom his first marriage whereas Partap, Trilok and Fateh were\n\nthe sons of Bichha from his second wife.              Karambir had been\n\ngiven 3-4 Kanals of land in excess out of his ancestral land and\n\ndue to this reason there was dispute between Karambir and\n\nPartap. The said fact is also evident from the cross examination\n\nof DW-1 Partap Singh son of Ram Sarup.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">               From the statements of the eye witnesses, it is evident\n\nthat Trilok and his son had also accompanied Partap and his\n\nsons to the spot at the time of crime armed with pistols. Merely\n\nbecause there was no litigation pending between Karambir and\n\nTrilok does not lead to the inference that he (Trilok) could not\n\nhave joined hands with his brother Partap to commit the crime.\n\nThe eye witnesses have categorically deposed that Trilok,\n\nDharender and Bijender had fired shots at Parveen. Balraj had\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\"> Crl. Appeal No. 910-DB of 2007 and                                 - 13-</span>\nCrl. Appeal No. 229-DB of 2008\n\nfired a shot at the complainant.           Thereafter, accused Jitender\n\nson of Ram Kishan had given knife blow on the person of Arvind.\n\nThus, it cannot be said that Trilok and Bijender had been falsely\n\ninvolved in this case. Rather, their participation in the crime is\n\nduly established by the eye witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">               So far as accused Ram Dia is concerned, he is not\n\nrelated to the other co-accused but his participation in the crime\n\ncannot be doubted.             PW-1 Hari Ram has categorically deposed\n\nthat Ram Dia had also fired a shot at Karambir along with other\n\nco-accused. PW-1 had no ill will or enmity against accused Ram\n\nDia to have falsely involved him in this case.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">               We have carefully gone through the inquest reports of\n\ndeceased Karambir and Parveen. Jasbir and Randhir had\n\nidentified the dead body of Karambir and in their statement\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/5431/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 175</a> Cr.P.C. they have stated that they had\n\nreached the spot and came to know that Partap and his sons had\n\nmurdered Karambir with knife and fire arms. A perusal of the\n\nstatement of Suresh recorded under <a href=\"/doc/5431/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 175</a> Cr.P.C. reveals\n\nthat he had identified the dead body of Parveen and has further\n\nstated that on reaching the spot he came to know that Partap\n\nand his sons had murdered his brother-in-law Karambir and\n\nnephew Parveen with knife and fire arms. The said witnesses\n\nwere not the eye witnesses to the occurrence and the fact that\n\nthey have not mentioned the names of the other accused would\n\nnot render the statements of the eye witnesses qua the\n\nparticipation of the accused in the crime doubtful. Further, the\n\nstatements of the said witnesses are hearsay and were recorded\n\nonly with a view to identify the dead bodies of the deceased. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\"> Crl.

Hence,     merely on the    basis of the\n\nstatements of Suresh, Jasbir and Randhir under <a href=\"/doc/5431/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 175</a>\n\nCr.P.C. it cannot be said that accused Trilok, Bijender and Ram\n\nDia were innocent. Thus, in the present case prosecution had\n\nbeen successful in proving its case. The statements of the eye\n\nwitnesses are trustworthy and are corroborated by medical\n\nevidence. The conviction and sentence of the appellants as\n\nordered by the trial court are liable to be upheld.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">               Accordingly, both the appeals are dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">       (JASBIR SINGH)                            (SABINA)\n         JUDGE                                    JUDGE\n\n\nMarch 20, 2012\nGurpreet\n </pre>","numcites":13,"numcitedby":28,"docsource":"Punjab-Haryana High Court","citetid":91916262,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"section 175 of the Criminal Procedure Code","formInput":"section%20175%20of%20the%20Criminal%20Procedure%20Code"},{"value":"section 313 of crpc","formInput":"section%20313%20of%20crpc"},{"value":"inquest report","formInput":"inquest%20report"},{"value":"sec 175 crpc ","formInput":"sec%20175%20crpc%20"},{"value":"disclosure statement","formInput":"disclosure%20statement"},{"value":" who can do post mortem examination   ","formInput":"%20who%20can%20do%20post%20mortem%20examination%20%20%20"},{"value":"175 crpc","formInput":"175%20crpc"},{"value":"property dispute","formInput":"property%20dispute"},{"value":"inquest","formInput":"inquest"},{"value":"Balraj ","formInput":"Balraj%20"},{"value":"section 313 of criminal procedure code","formInput":"section%20313%20of%20criminal%20procedure%20code"},{"value":"After sec.313 of cr.p.c.","formInput":"After%20sec.313%20of%20cr.p.c."},{"value":"pellets\\","formInput":"pellets%5C"},{"value":"313 cr.p.c","formInput":"313%20cr.p.c"},{"value":"313 crpc","formInput":"313%20crpc"},{"value":"incised wound","formInput":"incised%20wound"},{"value":"rattan singh","formInput":"rattan%20singh"},{"value":" Ram Kishan","formInput":"%20Ram%20Kishan"},{"value":"\"jasbir singh\"","formInput":"%22jasbir%20singh%22"},{"value":"eye witnesses","formInput":"eye%20witnesses"}],"cats":[{"value":"examine-accused","formInput":"tag:examine-accused"},{"value":"rioting","formInput":"tag:rioting"},{"value":"unlawful-assembly","formInput":"tag:unlawful-assembly"},{"value":"house-trespass","formInput":"tag:house-trespass"},{"value":"criminal-intimidation","formInput":"tag:criminal-intimidation"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
