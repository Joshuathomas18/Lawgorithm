None of the eye-witnesses in their statement has\n\nstated about causing any injury by accused Saurambai, Gulabbai,\n\nPrembai, Bhulibai, though they were armed with lathi, but no overt act\n\nhas been attributed to them. On coming to the knowledge about the\n\nincident they came at the place of occurrence and the learned trial\n\nCourt has wrongly convicted them by holding that they also inflicted\n\ninjury to the deceased and were member of the unlawful assembly\n\nand had actively participated in the alleged crime.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">18.

As per opinion                 given by\n\nDoctor(PW2), the injury, which was found on the vital part of the body\n\nof the deceased was dangerous to life, therefore, in our opinion on the\n\nfacts of the case the act committed with the knowledge that it is likely\n\nto cause death.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">20.   We ourselves have seen the judgment of the trial Court, which\n\nhas been passed after proper appreciation of the evidence of eye-\n\nwitnesses as well as the evidence of doctors and the Investigating\n\nOfficer, therefore, in our opinion the finding recorded regarding causing\n\ninjury by hard,sharp and blunt object like sword, Ballam, lathi and\n\nfarsi, the learned trial Court appears to be correct.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">21.   From the evidence on record, particularly, the medical evidence,\n\nit is clear that the death of Indersingh and Bapulal is homicidal in\n\nnature and considering the injuries which are caused to the deceased\n\nthe case will be that of culpable homicide. From the evidence on\n\nrecord, it is clear that all the material prosecution witnesses have\n\nstated in their deposition that it was the accused persons who had\n\ninflicted injuries to the deceased by means of farsi, ballam, lathi and\n sword and there is no reason to disbelieve the evidence of the\n\nprosecution witnesses. As per the statement of eye-witnesses,\n\nappellant no.5 - Saurambai, appellant no.6 - Gulabbai, appellant no.8\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">- Prembai and appellant no.9 - Bhulibai, on coming to the knowledge\n\nabout the incident they came at the place of occurrence. Since both\n\nthe parties were aggressive, therefore, they started moving their lathi,\n\nhowever, they do not know whether any injury is caused to anyone.\n\nNone of the eye-witnesses and injured in their statement has stated\n\nabout causing any injury by appellants no.5 - Saurambai, No.6 -\n\nGulabbai and No.8 - Prembai in Criminal Appeal No.46/2005 and\n\nappellant No.1 - Bhulibai in Criminal Appeal No.30/2005 though they\n\nwere armed with lathi, but no overt act has been attributed to them nor\n\nthey were     member of the unlawful assembly and had actively\n\nparticipated in the alleged crime. On the other hand, each of the\n\nmaterial prosecution witnesses have narrated the role of each of the\n\naccused namely Banshilal s/o Bhuraji, Mangilal, Dhannalal @\n\nDhaniram, Gorilal, Champalal, Dhulji, Gulabsingh, Banshilal S/o Dhulji\n\nand Bapulal S/o Navalsingh. No doubt an admission is also made to\n\nprove that the accused acted in self-defence but the prosecution has\n\nsuccessfully proved the case against accused them. From the\n\nevidence of prosecution witnesses, as these witnesses have received\n\ninjuries and it is proved by medical evidence, therefore, their evidence\n cannot be discarded. All the accused had come with deadly weapons\n\nby forming an unlawful assembly. Even the FSL report supports the\n\ncase of the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">22.   On due consideration of the material evidence available on\n\nrecord and also to the fact that at the time of incident, appellants were\n\ninflicting injuries by means of sword, lathi, ballam and farsi, over the\n\ndeceased and complainant, it is not the case of the appellants that\n\nthey have been falsely implicated in the alleged offence or there is no\n\nevidence against them. Looking to the evidence on record and the\n\ncircumstances, as aforesaid, we are not inclined to disturb the finding\n\nof the trial Court holding accused Bapulal S/o Naval Singh(in Cri.A.\n\nNo.27/2005), accused Champalal, Dhulji and Gulabsingh(in Cri.A.\n\nNo.30/2005) and Banshilal S/o Bhuraji, Mangilal, Dhannalal @\n\nDhaniram, Gorilal, Bnashilal S/o Dhulji(in Cri.A. No.46/2005) guilty\n\nof offence punishable under Sections, 147, 148, 323/149, 324/149,\n\n325/149 and 302/149 of IPC and under Section 25(1-B) of the Arms\n\nAct, 1959 and we confirm it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">23.   So far as accused appellants Saurambai, Prembai, Gulabbai\n\nand Bhulibai are concerned, no overt act has been attributed to them\n\nand none of the eye-witnesses in their statement has made allegation\n\nof causing injury by them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">24.   We have also gone through the evidence on record and the\n impugned judgment. Since accused no.7 Gangabai W/o Mangilal\n\nhas expired, during pendency of this appeal, this appeal against her\n\nhas been abated. So far as other accused persons are concerned,\n\nfrom the evidence on record, it is clear that at the most the injury\n\ncaused by the accused to the deceased was caused by the hard and\n\nblunt object and it is rightly believed that the accused were guilty of the\n\nalleged offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">25.   In view of this, we find that all the criminal appeals in respect of\n\naccused Bapualal(in Cri.A. No.27/2005), accused Champalal,\n\nDhulji and Gulabsingh(in Crio.A. No.30/2005) and accused\n\nBanshilal S/o Bhuraji, Mangilal, Dhannalal @ Dhaniram, Gorilal,\n\nand Banshilal S/o Dhulji (in Cri.A. No.46/2005) sans merit and\n\ndeserves to be dismissed as their conviction has been proved and\n\nthey found guilty under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_27\">Sections 323</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_28\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_29\">324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_30\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1133601/\" id=\"a_31\">325</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_32\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_33\">147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_34\">148</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_35\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_36\">149</a> of IPC and under <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 25</a>(1-B) of Arms Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">26.   In respect of accused Saurambai, Gulabbai, Prembai, and\n\nBhulibai are concerned, none of the eye-witnesses in their statement\n\nhas made any allegation of causing injury to the deceased as well as\n\nthe injured nor any overt act has been attributed to them, their\n\nconviction for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_38\">Sections 323</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_39\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_40\">324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_41\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1133601/\" id=\"a_42\">325</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_43\">149</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_44\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_45\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_46\">147</a> and <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_47\">148</a> of IPC are hereby set aside and they are\n\nacquitted of the alleged offence. They are on bail. Their bail bond shall\n       stand discharged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">      27.   For the foregoing reasons, the impugned judgments and orders\n\n      dated 23/12/2004, passed by learned Additional Sessions Judge,\n\n      Rajgarh(Biaora) in S.T. No.140/2002 are hereby confirmed against\n\n      Bapulal(in Cri.A. No.27/2005), accused Champalal, Dhulji and\n\n      Gulabsingh(in Cri.A.

Bail bonds, if any, of the accused\n\n      stand cancelled. Since The jail sentence of appellant - Bapulal S/o\n\n      Naval Singh (in Cri.A. No.27/2005) was also suspended by this Court\n\n      on 29/07/2016 and he is on bail, he shall surrender before the jail\n\n      authorities within a period of twelve weeks from today to serve out the\n\n      remaining period of sentence. Record and proceedings, if lying here,\n\n      be sent to the Court below forthwith.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">        (P.K.
