No.  35/1999  was  registered  by  the\nappellant,  and  after  investigation,  report  under  <a href=\"/doc/461024/\" id=\"a_7\">Section  173(2)</a>  CrPC\nagainst 41 persons including the respondents herein,  was  submitted  before\nthe  III  Additional  Chief   Metropolitan   Magistrate,   Vijayawada.

Raghupathy, learned Counsel appearing for the respondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">No doubt, while the respondents indulged in the  alleged  criminal  conduct,\nthey had been working as public servants. The question is not  whether  they\nwere in service or on duty or not but  whether  the  alleged  offences  have\nbeen committed by them &quot;while acting or purporting to act  in  discharge  of\ntheir official duty&quot;. That question is no  more  res  integra.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"987738\" id=\"span_1\">In  <a href=\"/doc/987738/\" id=\"a_12\">Shambhoo\nNath Misra v. State of U.P. and others</a>[1], at paragraph-5, this  Court  held\nthat:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">&quot;5. The question is when the public servant is  alleged  to  have  committed\nthe offence of fabrication of record  or  misappropriation  of  public  fund\netc. can he be said to have acted in discharge of his  official  duties.  It\nis not the official duty of  the  public  servant  to  fabricate  the  false\nrecords and misappropriate the public funds etc. in  furtherance  of  or  in\nthe discharge of his official duties. The  official  capacity  only  enables\nhim to fabricate the record or misappropriate the public fund etc.  It  does\nnot mean that it is integrally connected  or  inseparably  interlinked  with\nthe crime committed in the course of the same transaction, as  was  believed\nby the learned Judge. Under these circumstances, we are of the opinion  that\nthe view expressed by the High Court as well as by the trial  court  on  the\nquestion of sanction is clearly illegal and cannot be sustained.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1634320\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/1634320/\" id=\"a_13\">Parkash Singh Badal v. State of Punjab and  others</a>[2],  at  paragraph-20,\nthis Court held that:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;20. The principle of immunity protects all acts which  the  public  servant\nhas to perform in the exercise of  the  functions  of  the  Government.  The\npurpose for which they are  performed  protects  these  acts  from  criminal\nprosecution. However, there  is  an  exception.  Where  a  criminal  act  is\nperformed under the colour of authority but which  in  reality  is  for  the\npublic [pic]servant&#x27;s own pleasure or benefit then such acts  shall  not  be\nprotected under the doctrine of State immunity.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">and thereafter, at paragraph-38, it was further held that:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;38. The question relating to the need of sanction under <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 197</a> of  the\nCode is not necessarily to be considered as soon as the complaint is  lodged\nand on the allegations contained therein. This question  may  arise  at  any\nstage of the proceeding. The question whether sanction is necessary  or  not\nmay have to be determined from stage to stage.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">   In   a   recent   decision   in    Rajib    Ranjan    and    others    v.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">   R. Vijaykumar[3], at paragraph-18, this Court has  taken  the  view  that\n... &quot;even while discharging his official duties, if a public servant  enters\ninto  a  criminal  conspiracy  or  indulges  in  criminal  misconduct,  such\nmisdemeanour on his part is not to be treated as an act in discharge of  his\nofficial duties and, therefore, provisions of <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 197</a> of the  Code  will\nnot be attracted&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">Public servants have, in  fact,  been  treated  as  special  category  under\n<a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 197</a> CrPC, to protect them from malicious or  vexatious  prosecution.\nSuch protection from harassment  is  given  in  public  interest;  the  same\ncannot be treated as shield to protect  corrupt  officials.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"116362443\" id=\"span_3\">In  <a href=\"/doc/116362443/\" id=\"a_17\">Subramanian\nSwamy v. Manmohan Singh and another</a>[4], at paragraph-74, it  has  been  held\nthat the provisions dealing with <a href=\"/doc/12704/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 197</a> CrPC must be construed in  such\na manner as to advance the cause of honesty, justice  and  good  governance.\nTo quote:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">&quot;74. ... Public servants are treated as a special class of persons  enjoying\nthe said protection so that they can perform their duties without  fear  and\nfavour and without threats  of  malicious  prosecution.  However,  the  said\nprotection against  malicious  prosecution  which  was  extended  in  public\ninterest cannot become a shield to  protect  [pic]corrupt  officials.  These\nprovisions being exceptions to the equality  provision  of  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_19\">Article  14</a>  are\nanalogous  to  the  provisions  of  protective  discrimination   and   these\nprotections must be construed very  narrowly.  These  procedural  provisions\nrelating to sanction must be construed in such a manner as  to  advance  the\ncauses of honesty and justice and good governance as opposed  to  escalation\nof corruption.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">The alleged indulgence of the officers in cheating, fabrication  of  records\nor misappropriation cannot be said to be  in  discharge  of  their  official\nduty. Their official duty is not to fabricate records or permit  evasion  of\npayment of duty and cause loss  to  the  Revenue.  Unfortunately,  the  High\nCourt missed these crucial aspects. The  learned  Magistrate  has  correctly\ntaken the view  that  if  at  all  the  said  view  of  sanction  is  to  be\nconsidered, it could be done at the stage of trial only.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_10\">Resultantly, the impugned orders are set aside.  Appeals  are  allowed.
