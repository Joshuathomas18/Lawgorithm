The prosecution  case  as  it  discerned  from  the  records  is\n           briefly, as follows :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      Shisha Singh and Mohar Singh  were  residents  of  village  Dongpura,\nwhereas  Gurdip  Singh  was  resident  of  adjacent  village  Varnau.    On\n13/14.7.1984, at about midnight Gurdip Singh heard firing  and  cries  from\nthe houses of Shisha Singh and Mohar Singh and armed with his licensed  gun\nhe along with Jassa Singh and Hazoor Singh  moved  towards  the  house   of\nShisha Singh.   In the moonlight and the light of the torch he  saw  Kartar\nSingh and his son Mahender Singh standing on the roof top of the  house  of\nShisha Singh holding gun and country made  -pistol  and  Kartar  Singh  was\nshouting aloud to his sons Mahendra Singh, Lakkha Singh, Ginder  Singh  and\nSinder Singh to eliminate the  whole family of Shisha Singh and Mohar Singh\nand that none should escape away. They fired several gun shots  and  Gurdip\nSingh withdrew himself back and at that time Harbans Kaur  wife  of  Shisha\nSingh escaped from the house with injuries  and  came  and  told  him  that\nKartar Singh and his four sons accompanied by all the four sons of Sampuran\nSingh and Balkar Singh had killed all the family members  of  Shisha  Singh\nand Mohar Singh and sought help from him. Harbans Kaur was taken to a safer\nplace and thereafter Gurdip Singh along with  Jaswant  Singh  went  to  the\nJhinjhana Police Station and gave an oral complaint which  was  reduced  to\nwriting by  PW14  Head-Mouri  and  First  Information  Report  came  to  be\nregistered at about 4.15 a.m. on 14.7.1984.  The police party rushed to the\nplace of occurrence and S.J. Mohd. Akhtar, S.O., Jhinjhana Police  Station,\ntook up the investigation and sent the injured to the hospital.

One  of  the  accused  died  and  the\n           Sessions Court framed charges against the  accused  persons  and\n           during the trial  the  prosecution  examined  18  witnesses  and\n           marked 93 Exhibits.  During trial four accused  absconded.   The\n           Sessions Court examined accused Nos.1 to  8  under  <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_9\">Section  313</a>\n           Cr.P.C.

Mr.  R.S.Sodhi,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the  appellants\n           submitted that Harbans Kaur  is  the  sole  eye-witness  to  the\n           occurrence and in her earlier statement  before  the  Magistrate\n           within a few hours of the occurrence, she has told that Surender\n           Singh has fired gun shots at her and Surender, Mahender,  Jinder\n           who are sons of Kartar Singh were involved and thereafter in her\n           statement given before the I.O. in addition to  the  above  said\n           accused persons she named  the  appellants/accused  Nos.1  to  5\n           amongst the assailants and,  therefore,  her  testimony  is  not\n           reliable, and lot of material improvements were  introduced  and\n           there is no motive attributable to the  present  appellants  and\n           it’s a midnight occurrence  and  in  the  absence  of  effective\n           source of light it is doubtful as to whether the  witness  could\n           have recognized the assailants  and  the  appellants  have  been\n           falsely implicated in the case.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">       10. Per contra Mr. Ratnakar Das, Senior Advocate appearing  for  the\n           respondent contended that  Harbans Kaur was seriously injured in\n           the occurrence and only one question was asked by the Magistrate\n           as to who caused injury to her  and  in  her  reply  -she  named\n           Surender Singh and the other sons of Kartar Singh and it related\n           to a part of occurrence so far as the injured is  concerned  and\n           did not in any way relate to rest of the  occurrence  and  after\n           gaining full consciousness in her  statement  given  before  the\n           Investigation Officer she has narrated the entire occurrence and\n           the names of all the accused, and in the  FIR  which  came  into\n           being immediately after the occurrence based  on  the  complaint\n           given by Sardar Gurdip Singh,  the  names  of  all  the  accused\n           persons are found mentioned  and there was also motive  for  the\n           occurrence.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">       11. Harbans Kaur is the wife of Shisha Singh and the dwelling  house\n           of Mohar Singh was adjacent to her house. PW 4 Harbans  Kaur  in\n           her testimony has stated that on the  fateful  night  she  along\n           with her sons Joginder Singh and Jassa Singh  and  her  daughter\n           Rano, Joginder’s  wife Bhajan Kaur and her three children  Bagga\n           Singh, Phulvender and Gurmit Singh were sleeping  in  her  house\n           and her husband was sleeping in the tubewell and a  lantern  was\n           burning in the house and on hearing the  barking  of  dogs  they\n           woke-up and saw group of people at the -gate  including   Kartar\n           Singh and his four sons namely  Mahendra  Singh,  Lakkha  Singh,\n           Ginder Singh and  Sindar  Singh  and  they  were  carrying  gun,\n           country made pistol, axe and spade.  She also noticed among them\n           the four sons of Sampuran Singh namely  appellants  Veer  Singh,\n           Tahal Singh, Amreek Singh and   Kamir Singh  along  with  Balkar\n           Singh armed with weapons and lathi  in the assembly, and out  of\n           fear she and her family  members went into a room and bolted the\n           door from inside.  Kartar Singh and Mahender  Singh  climbed  up\n           the roof and started demolishing the  roof   and  threw  burning\n           wood  from the roof. Kartar Singh was shouting aloud to his sons\n           to finish off all the members of  family  of  Shisha  Singh  and\n           Mohar Singh and not to allow anybody to escape alive. It is  her\n           further testimony that when she and  the  other  family  members\n           tried to escape, accused Kartar Singh,  Mahender  Singh,  Balkar\n           Singh and Amreek Singh let loose  killing  spree  and  initially\n           killed her daughter Rano, her daughter-in-law Bhajan  Kaur,  her\n           sons Kulvendra and Gurpreet Singh and they  fired  gun-shots  on\n           her which struck on her chest and accused  Sinder  attacked  her\n           with an axe on her hand and mouth and her sons Jassa  Singh  and\n           Joginder Singh were killed outside their -house when they  tried\n           to run away.  She heard cries emanating from the house of  Mohar\n           Singh and five persons of their family were also killed and  she\n           ran to the field of paddy hiding herself where  she  met  Gurdip\n           Singh,  Hazoor  Singh  and  Jaswant  Singh  and   narrated   the\n           occurrence to them and sought their help to lodge the  complaint\n           and Gurdip Singh along  with  Jaswant  Singh  proceeded  to  the\n           Police Station.  She has further testified that she asked Hazoor\n           Singh to go to the tubewell and inform  her  husband  about  the\n           occurrence.  Hazoor Singh came back and  told  her  that  Shisha\n           Singh and Mohar Singh were also hacked to death.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">       12. From the above testimony it becomes evident  that PW  4  Harbans\n           Kaur has witnessed the occurrence and also  sustained   grievous\n           injuries.  Immediately  after  the  occurrence  in  the  morning\n           itself Harbans Kaur was admitted in the hospital  for  treatment\n           and information was sent to Magistrate for recording  her  dying\n           declaration.  In the hospital she was examined by PW 6 Dr.  N.K.\n           Sharma and he  noticed  8  injuries  on  her  body  and  he  has\n           expressed opinion that the lacerated  wounds  could  have  -been\n           caused by sharp-edged weapons and injury No.6  could  have  been\n           caused by firearm. The injuries sustained by her were serious in\n           nature. The SDM Shamli reached the hospital at  12.45  p.m.  and\n           recorded her statement in  question-answer  form  and  only  one\n           question was asked as to how she sustained the injuries and  she\n           told that she was shot by Surender  Singh  in  the  presence  of\n           other sons of Kartar Singh.  In other words the reply  pertained\n           only to that part of the occurrence in which she was injured and\n           not the entire occurrence.   In fact PW 4 Harbans  Kaur  in  her\n           testimony before the Court has clearly stated as to why she  has\n           given a limited answer to the Magistrate.  Further   it is not a\n           dying declaration since she survived and it is only a  statement\n           under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 164</a> of the Cr.P.C. which can be used under <a href=\"/doc/1002421/\" id=\"a_11\">Section\n           157</a> of the  Evidence Act for the purpose  of  corroboration  and\n           under <a href=\"/doc/69347904/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 155</a> of the Act for the purpose  of  contradiction.\n           This statement did not relate to the entire occurrence.  It must\n           be borne in mind that she had witnessed the brutal murder of all\n           her family members by the appellants and  other  accused  during\n           the occurrence and when she was in  a  state  of  shock  in  the\n           hospital she had given  answer  to  the  -question  put  by  the\n           Magistrate. After regaining her health when she was examined  by\n           the Investigation Officer, she has stated the entire  occurrence\n           naming the assailants and the attack made by them with weapons.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">       13. There is intrinsic evidence  available  on  record  which  lends\n           credence to her testimony. The  occurrence  took  place  in  the\n           midnight and  the  complaint  was  lodged  in  Jhinjhana  Police\n           Station at 4.15 a.m. on 14.7.1984 without any loss of time.  The\n           complainant Gurdip Singh was also murdered before the trial.  In\n           the complaint Gurdip Singh has stated that  during  midnight  on\n           the occurrence day he heard loud noise and screaming  from   the\n           house of Shisha Singh and Mohar Singh. He took up  his  licensed\n           gun and moved towards the house of Shisha Singh with Jassa Singh\n           and Hajoor Singh and saw  in the moon lit night and also in  the\n           light  shed by the torch, Kartar  Singh  and  his  son  Mahender\n           Singh  standing on the roof of Shisha Singh’s house  and  Kartar\n           Singh loudly directed his  sons  to  wipe  off  all  the  family\n           members of Shisha Singh and Mohar Singh  and  when  he  and  his\n           fellows challenged, all of a sudden the assailants  opened -fire\n           on them and he stepped back and it  was  at  that  time  injured\n           Harbans Kaur who escaped from the occurrence place met him   and\n           told him that  Kartar  Singh  and  his  sons  along  with  other\n           accused have killed all the members of her family and  also  the\n           family of Mohar Singh, and pleaded for help and  to  inform  the\n           police.   After providing her  safety  he  went  to  the  Police\n           Station and gave oral complaint which was reduced to writing and\n           he appended his signature on it.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">       14. The Head-Mouri of the Police Station Shri Inder Pal Sharma, PW14\n           has recorded the oral complaint of Gurdip Singh  and  registered\n           the FIR, Exh.Ka-18.  The extract  of  G.D.  is  Exh.Ka-19.   The\n           names  of  assailants  including  the  names  of   the   present\n           appellants are found mentioned in the complaint lodged by Gurdip\n           Singh.   It is  also relevant to point out that  no  enmity   is\n           attributed to Gurdip Singh against the assailants and  there  is\n           no reason for him to falsely implicate  the  appellants  in  the\n           case.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">       15. Hazoor Singh has been examined as PW 5 and in his examination-in-\n           chief he has stated that  on the occurrence night he  heard  the\n           noise of firing coupled with screaming cries from the  house  of\n           Shisha Singh and Mohar Singh and he went to the house  of  Jassa\n           Singh and both of them went to the house  of  Gurdip  Singh  who\n           accompanied them by taking gun and torch and when they went near\n           the house of Shisha Singh they saw several men and he could  not\n           identify any of them and Harbans Kaur met them  there  and  told\n           them that Kartar Singh and other assailants have attacked  them.\n             At  this  point  of  time  he  was  declared  hostile  by  the\n           prosecution and in the cross-examination he stated  that  Gurdip\n           Singh had lodged the  complaint  about  the  occurrence  in  the\n           Police Station and when Harbans Kaur narrated the occurrence, he\n           was also present at the place and on the request of Harbans Kaur\n           he went to the tubewell and found  Shisha Singh and Mohar  Singh\n           lying dead and he informed Harbans Kaur about the same  and  she\n           became unconscious.   It is settled law that  the  testimony  of\n           the hostile witness need not  be  discarded  in  toto  and  that\n           portion of testimony in the chief-examination which supports the\n           prosecution case can be taken for consideration.  In the present\n           case, in the examination-in-chief itself PW 5 Hazoor  Singh  has\n           admitted about his going to -the place of occurrence along  with\n           Gurdip Singh and Jaswant Singh on hearing the  noise  of  firing\n           and cries emanating from the house of  Shisha  Singh  and  Mohar\n           Singh and the narration of the occurrence  by  Harbans  Kaur  to\n           them  which  led  to  lodging  of  the  complaint.    The  above\n           testimony of PW 5 lends credence to the testimony of PW 4.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">       16. The Investigation Officer    PW  18  S.J.  Mohd.  Akhtar,  after\n           taking up the investigation went to  the  occurrence  place  and\n           seized blood-stained materials and also went to the roof of  the\n           house of Shisha Singh and took brick from the damaged  roof  and\n           also ashes from the room, which have been marked as Exh.  Ka  40\n           and 41, respectively.  This also lends credence to the testimony\n           of PW 4 Harbans Kaur that the assailants damaged  the  roof  and\n           threw burning wood inside the room during the occurrence.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"106861567\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"144069014\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1524844\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1981490\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"406841\" id=\"span_6\">17. Legal system has laid emphasis on value, weight and  quality  of\n           evidence rather than on quantity multiplicity  or  plurality  of\n           witnesses.  It is not the number of witnesses  but  -quality  of\n           their evidence which is important as  there  is  no  requirement\n           under  the  Law  of  Evidence  that  any  particular  number  of\n           witnesses is to be examined to prove/disprove a fact.

In the present case we are  left  with  the  sole  testimony  of\n           injured eye-witness PW4 Harbans Kaur.   She  has  lost  all  the\n           members of her family  in  the  attack  during  the  occurrence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">           -There is no reason for her to falsely  implicate   any  of  the\n           accused in the case.  On the contrary she would only  point  out\n           the correct assailants who  are  responsible   for  killing  her\n           family  members.   We  are  of  the  considered  view  that  the\n           testimony  of  PW4  Harbans  Kaur  is   cogent,   credible   and\n           trustworthy and has a ring of  truth  and  deserves  acceptance.\n           All the  12  victims  of  the  occurrence    died  of  homicidal\n           violence is established by the oral testimony of the doctors who\n           conducted autopsies on their bodies and the certificates  issued\n           by them to that effect.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">       19. There was also motive for the occurrence.  It is  the  testimony\n           of the PW4 Harbans Kaur that her husband lent a sum of Rs.8000/-\n           to Mahender Singh  son of Kartar Singh  8  years  prior  to  the\n           occurrence and  he  was  avoiding  to  pay  back  which  created\n           bitterness.  Besides the above, it  is  also  indicated  in  her\n           testimony that Mahender Singh suspected that family  members  of\n           Harbans Kaur had tipped  the  police  about  the  activities  of\n           Mahender Singh which led to his arrest twice  by  the  Jhinjhana\n           and Kairana Police. It is her further testimony that Mohar Singh\n           has also lent some money to Mahender Singh  and  this  testimony\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">           -also finds support from the evidence of PW  9  Mukhtiyar  Singh\n           son of Mohar Singh to the effect  that  Lakka  Singh  had  taken\n           Rs.1600/- from Mohar Singh about 5  years  prior  to  occurrence\n           which he had declined to pay despite repeated demands. Both  the\n           above witnesses namely PW4 Harbans Kaur and PW9 Mukhtiyar  Singh\n           have testified  that  Mahendro  sister  of  Mahender  Singh  had\n           developed illicit  intimacy with Avtar  Singh  @  Pappu  son  of\n           Mohar Singh and had  once outraged  her  modesty  which  led  to\n           convening of a Panchayat and  decision  thereof.     Enraged  by\n           this Mahender Singh wanted to take revenge and that has resulted\n           in the occurrence.  In this context it is relevant to point  out\n           that the appellants in their answers to  the  questions  put  to\n           them during proceedings  under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C.in  the  trial\n           have alleged that they have been falsely implicated in the  case\n           on account of enmity.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">       20. From the evidence  on  record  we  are  inclined  to  hold  that\n           appellants along with  other  accused  armed  with  weapons  had\n           committed trespass into the dwelling houses of Shisha Singh  and\n           Mohar Singh during mid-night with a view  to  commit  murder  of\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">           -the family members of Shisha Singh and Mohar Singh and  carried\n           out  the  same.   The  High  Court  has  rightly  sustained  the\n           conviction on the appellants and the sentence  awarded  to  them\n           are also proper.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">       21.
