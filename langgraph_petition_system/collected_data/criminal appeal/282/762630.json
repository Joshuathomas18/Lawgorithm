The High Court convicted the accused\nNos. 3 and 4 for contravention of sub-section 6 of section 5\nof the\tMaritime Zones\tof India Act, 1981 (M.Z.I. Act) read\nwith section  7 thereof and rule 16 of the Maritime Zones of\nIndia Rules  1981,  (M.Z.I.  Rules).  The  High\t Court\talso\nordered confiscation  of the  two trawlers, vesting the same\nin favour  of the Central Government under section 13 of the\nM.Z.I. Act.\n     The   two\t  trawlers   involved-foreign\tvessels-were\nchartered by  the respondents  Nos. 4 &amp; 5 herein for fishing\nin Maritime  Zone of  India  after  obtaining  permit  under\nsection 5  of the  M.Z.I. Act. The trawlers along with three\nother pairs  of trawlers  were apprehended and seized by the\nCoast Guard  ship commanded  by Commander  S.D.\t Baijal\t for\nfishing operations  in the exclusive economic zone of India,\nin violation  of the  terms and conditions of the permit and\nthe  letter  of\t intent\t granted  to  that  company  by\t the\nGovernment of India under section 5(4) of the M.Z.I. Act and\nin violation  of the  M.Z.I. Rules.  They were prosecuted by\nthe  Additional\t  Chief\t Metropolitan\tMagistrate  on\t the\ncomplaint filed\t by  Commander\tS.D.  Baijal  as  authorised\nofficer under  section 19  of the M.Z.I. Act. The masters of\nthe trawlers,  respondents Nos.\t 2 and 3, were convicted and\nsentenced to  pay fines\t and the  other accused\t respondents\nNos. 4\tand 5 were acquitted and the trawlers and the fishes\nthereon were  ordered to  be  released\ton  payment  of\t the\ndetention\n642\ncharges. Of  the  other\t three\tpairs  of  foreign  trawlers\nchartered by Indian Company for fishing in the Maritime Zone\nof India  under the  permit granted  under the\tM.Z.I.\tAct,\nwhich were seized and prosecuted, two pairs of trawlers with\nfishes thereon were ordered to be confiscated while one pair\nof these  trawlers were directed to be released. The masters\nof each\t pair  of  trawlers  were  similarly  convicted\t and\nsentenced to pay fine for violation of the provisions of the\nsaid Act and the Rules thereunder.\n     The Masters  of the  pair of  trawlers filed a criminal\nappeal against\ttheir  conviction  and\tsentence  while\t the\ncomplaining Commander  S.D. Baijal  filed a  criminal appeal\nagainst the  acquittal of  respondent Nos.  4 and 5 i.e. the\nManaging Director  of the  company and\tthe company and also\nagainst the  release of\t the trawlers in spite of conviction\nof the\tmasters under  section 12(b)  of the M.Z.I. Act. The\nHigh Court  disposed of\t these appeals by a common judgment,\nallowing the  appeal of\t the masters  in part  and modifying\ntheir sentence\tand convicting.\t in the appeal filed by S.D.\nBaijal,\t the  Managing\tDirector  and-the  Company,  accused\nrespondents Nos.  3 and\t 4 and sentencing them to pay fines,\nand ordering  the trawlers  to be  confiscated\twith  fishes\nthereon or the proceeds thereof in case of sale of the same.\nThe High  Court also held the masters of the trawlers guilty\nunder Rule  8(1)(g) and\t convicted them\t under section 12(a)\ninstead of  section 12(b)  of the M.Z.I. Act, but maintained\nthe sentence of penalty.\n     Criminal Appeals  Nos. 645-47;87  and Criminal  Appeals\nNos. 65051  of 1987  arose out\tof a  common judgment of the\nHigh Court  in two  criminal appeals,  modifying in part the\njudgment and  order of\tthe  Additional\t Chief\tMetropolitan\nMagistrate, whereby the Magistrate had convicted the masters\nof the\ttrawlers, i.e. accused Nos. 1 and 2 for contravening\nRule 8(1)(g)  read with\t Rule 16  and section  20(b) of\t the\nM.Z.I. Act  and sentenced  them to  pay fines, in default of\npayment\t of  fine,  to\tsuffer\trigorous  imprisonment.\t The\nMagistrate also\t had made  an order,  confiscating  the\t two\ntrawlers alongwith  the fishing\t gear,\tequipments,  stores,\ncargo and  fish and  vesting  the  same\t together  with\t the\nproceeds of  the sale  of the fish, if any, with the Central\nGovernment. The\t Magistrate had acquitted the accused Nos. 3\nand 4  i.e. the Charterer Company and its Managing Director.\nThe criminal  appeal filed  by Cdr.  S.D. Baijal against the\norder acquitting  the accused  Nos. 3  and 4  above said was\nallowed by  the High  Court  and  they\twere  convicted\t and\nsentenced to pay fines etc. The order of confiscation of the\ntwo trawlers  was maintained.  The criminal  appeal filed by\nthe  masters   of  the\t trawlers  was\tdismissed  with\t the\nmodification that the conviction\n643\nmade under  section 12(b)  was altered\tto one under section\n12(a) of  the  M.Z.I.  Act  and\t the  sentence\tof  vigorous\nimprisonment was modified.\n     Criminal Appeals  Nos. 648-49.87  and Criminal  Appeals\nNos. 65253187  arose out  of a\tcommon judgment\t of the High\nCourt, dismissing  the appeals of the masters of the vessels\nand allowing the appeals filed on behalf of the prosecution.\nAll these  appeals were filed against the judgment and order\nof the\tAdditional  Chief  Metropolitan\t Magistrate  in\t the\nCriminal case  wherein\tthe  Magistrate\t had  convicted\t and\nsentenced the masters of the trawlers with the imposition of\nfines on accused Nos. 1 and 2 for contravening Rules 8(1)(g)\nand 16\tof the\tM.Z.I. Rules  and also\tof the offence under\nsection 5  of the Act and imposing penalty u/s. 12(b) of the\nM.Z.I. Act.  The Magistrate had acquitted the accused Nos. 3\nand 4  i.e. the\t Charterer Company and its Managing Director\nand directed  the release  of the  trawlers in favour of the\nmasters of  the trawlers.  The criminal\t appeal filed by the\nmasters of  the vessels\t was dismissed by the High Court and\nthe conviction\tand sentence u/s 12(b) of the M.Z.I. Act was\naltered to  one under section 12(a) of the Act. The criminal\nappeal filed  on behalf\t of the\t prosecution was allowed and\nthe accused  Nos. 3 and 4 i.e. the Charterer Company and its\nManaging Director, were convicted and sentenced to pay fine.\nThe vessel  and the  fishing equipment\twere confiscated and\ndirected to vest in favour of the Central Government.\n     Criminal Appeal  Nos. 654-55/87 and Criminal Appeal No.\n656 of\t1987 arose out of a common judgment and order of the\nHigh Court  in the  Criminal Appeals filed by the Charterers\nand the masters of the trawlers, respectively. These appeals\nwere filed  against the judgment and order of the Additional\nChief Metropolitan Magistrate in a criminal case against the\nmasters\t of   vessel.  The   Magistrate\t had  convicted\t and\nsentenced the  accused Nos. 1 and 2, i.e. the masters of the\nvessel\tto   pay  fines;  in  default  to  undergo  rigorous\nimprisonment, and had confiscated the trawlers together with\nfishing gear, equipment, stores, cargo and fish therein. The\ncriminal appeal\t of the\t masters of  the trawlers  had\tbeen\ndismissed with a modification of the conviction and sentence\npassed under  section 12(c) of the M.Z.I. Act was altered to\none u/s\t 12(a) of  the Act  and the  criminal appeal  of the\nCharterers  was\t  dismissed  with   a  modification  of\t the\nimprisonment awarded  in default  of payment of fine imposed\non the\tappellant to simple imprisonment instead of rigorous\nimprisonment. The  order of  confiscation of trawlers passed\nby the Magistrate was confirmed.\n     Dismissing all the appeals, the Court,\n644\n^\n     HELD: The\tappellants contended that at the time of the\napprehension of the trawlers no fish had been found on board\nand there  was no  evidence that fish on board was seized or\nthat what  had happened\t to fish  or who had put the fish in\nthe  hold   of\tthe   trawlers,\t and   that,  therefore,  no\npresumption under  section 22 of the Act could be drawn that\nthe trawlers  were engaged  in fishing\twithin the exclusive\neconomic zone  of India in contravention of the provision of\nthe Act\t and the  Rules framed\tthereunder. This  contention\ncould not  be considered in appeal by special leave as there\nhad been  concurrent  findings\tby  the\t Chief\tMetropolitan\nMagistrate and\tthe High Court that there was fish on board.\n[649F-H; 650A]\n     The main  argument on  behalf  of\tthe  appellants\t was\nfocussed on  the vital question as to whether the words used\nin section  13 of  the M.Z.I.  Act &quot;shall  also be liable to\nconfiscation&quot; mandated\tthat the  foreign vessel used in the\ncommission of  the offence  would be con fiscated as soon as\nthe masters  were convicted  under section 10 or 11 or 12 of\nthe Act,  or it\t was the  discretion of\t the Court  to order\neither release\tof the\tvessel or confiscation of the vessel\nwith the  fish and  the other  equipment, cargo\t and fishing\ngear, considering  the\tgraveness  of  the  offence.  On  an\nexamination of\tthe objects  and  Reasons  and\tthe  various\nprovisions of  the Maritime  Zones of  India (Regulation  of\nFishing by  Foreign Vessels) Act, 1981, it was crystal clear\nthat the  M.Z.I. Act  had been\tenacted with  the object  of\npreventing illegal  poaching of\t fishes by  foreign vessels,\nincluding foreign  vessels chartered  by Indian\t citizens in\nthe exclusive economic zone of India at a depth less than 40\nfathoms, by providing deterrent punishment for contravention\nof the\tprovisions of  the Act\tto protect Indian fishermen.\nThe objects  and reasons were to be taken into consideration\nin  interpreting   the\tprovisions   of\t the   statute.\t  In\ninterpreting a\tstatute, the Court has to ascertain the will\nand policy  of F.  the legislature  as discernible  from the\nobject and  scheme of  the enactment  and the  language used\ntherein. Viewed\t in this  context, it  was apparent that the\nsaid Act  had been  made with the sole purpose of preventing\npoaching of  fishes by\tforeign vessels\t chartered by Indian\ncitizens within\t the exclusive\teconomic zone  of  India  as\nspecified in Rule 8(1)(g) of Maritime Zone of India Rules as\namended in  1982 as  well as  in breach of the provisions of\nthe said  Act and  the terms  and conditions  of the  permit\nissued under section 5 of the said Act. [650E-G; 651D; 654F]\n     Section 13\t of the\t Act expressly says that besides the\nconviction and\tsentence of  the masters of the vessels, and\ncharterers, the\t vessel is  liable to  be  confiscated\twith\nfishes therein.\t The appellants&#x27;  contention  was  that\t the\nwords &quot;shall also be liable to confiscation&quot; used in section\n13 of\n645\nthe Act did not mean that it was mandatory to confiscate the\nvessel as  the masters\tof the vessel had been convicted and\nsentenced to pay penalty under section 12 of the Act, and as\nvarious punishments had been provided for different types of\noffences, it  was left\tto the\tdiscretion of  the court  to\norder confiscation  of the  vessel or to release the vessel.\n[655A-C]\n     Section 13\t in clear and unimbiguous terms says that on\nthe conviction of the master and the charterer of an offence\nunder section  10 or 11 or 12, the vessel used in connection\nwith the  offence together  with the fish on board such ship\nor the\tsale proceeds  of such fish, and stores, cargo shall\nalso be\t liable to  confiscation. Viewed in the context, the\nwords &quot;shall also be liable to be confiscation&quot; do not leave\nany discretion\tto the\tMagistrate or  the court  to make no\norder of  confiscation of  the vessel as soon as the masters\nof the\tvessel were convicted u/s 10 or 11 or 12 of the Act.\nThe Legislative\t intent in  making  this  provision  was  to\nprovide deterrent  punishment to  prohibit  fishing  in\t the\nexclusive economic  zone of  India  by\tforeign\t vessels  in\ninfringement of\t the Act and the rules framed thereunder and\nthe conditions\tof the\tpermit or  licence. Viewed  in\tthis\ncontext, section  13 mandates  that  on\t conviction  of\t the\nmaster and the charterer of an offence under section 12, not\nonly penalty of fine would be imposed, the vessel used in or\nin connection  with the commission of such offence has to be\nconfiscated. It\t is not\t open to  the court  to consider the\ngraveness of the offence and other extenuating circumstances\nand to\tmake no\t order for  confiscation  of  the  offending\nvessel\tconcerned.   Confiscation  of\tthe  vessel  is\t the\nimmediate statutory  consequence  of  the  finding  that  an\noffence either\tunder section 10 or 11 or 12 has been proved\nand the\t master of the vessel has been convicted. Section 13\nis thus mandatory and it is not open to the court to refrain\nfrom making  an order,\tconfiscating the offending vessel as\nsoon as\t the masters  of the  vessel  are  convicted  of  an\noffence under section 12 and awarded penalty. [660BF]\n     The  judgments  and  orders  of  the  High\t Court\twere\naffirmed. The vessels had been detained in Bombay Port after\napprehending them  on July 26, 1984 and a huge amount had to\nbe  paid   as  port   charges.\tConsidering  the  facts\t and\ncircumstances of  the case,  the Port  Authorities at Bombay\nmight consider if an application was made by the parties for\nexemption or  partial exemption\t of the\t same favourably  in\nview of the order of confiscation of the trawlers.

There  was  no\nevidence that  fish on\tboard was  seized nor  there was any\nevidence to  show what\thad happened  to fish or who put the\nfish in\t the hold  of the  trawlers. It has, therefore, been\nsubmitted that\tno presumption\tunder section 22 of the said\nAct can\t be drawn  that the trawlers were engaged in fishing\nwithin the exclusive economic zone of India in contravention\nof  the\t  provisions  of   the\tAct  and  the  Rules  framed\nthereunder. This  contention cannot  be considered  in\tthis\nappeal under  special leave  as there  has  been  concurrent\nfindings\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">650</span>\nby the\tChief Metropolitan Magistrate as well as by the High\nCourt that  there was  fish on board which includes the hold\nof the trawlers. The learned single Judge observed:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t  &quot;I am,  however; unable to accept that for a minor\n\t  omission to  make entry  of finding of the fish or\n\t  the net  in the  officers&#x27;  diary  can  by  itself\n\t  negative the\tevidence of  actual finding  of\t the\n\t  fish and  the wet  net on  the deck and in my view\n\t  the Authority\t quoted will  have no application to\n\t  the facts of this case.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">     The High  Court further  held on a consideration of the\nevidence that  the fishing  trawlers were fishing in a depth\nwithin 40  fathoms and the finding of the Magistrate on this\nscore is  unassailable. There  has been violation of amended\nRule 8(1)(q)  of M.Z,.I. Rules. Condition 2(S) of the permit\nprovides that  any condition could be imposed which would be\nbinding on  the charterers,  masters of\t the trawlers.\tRule\n8(1)(q) requires  the. trawlers\t to fish  at a depth of more\nthan 40\t fathoms. This\tcondition in  the  permit  has\tbeen\nviolated.  The\t masters  and\tthe  charterers\t  have\tbeen\naccordingly convicted  under section 12(a) by the High Court\nas the\tviolation is  with regard  to the  area of operation\nspecified in  the permit  and the  penalty provided  for the\nsame is\t not exceeding\tRs.5 lakhs.  As the  Magistrate\t has\nexercised his  discretion in  sentencing the  masters to pay\nlesser amount  as penalty the High Court did not consider it\nproper to interfere with the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">     The main  argument\t on  behalf  of\t the  appellant\t was\nfocussed on  the vital question as to whether the words used\nin Section  13 of  M.Z.I.  Act\t&quot;shall\talso  be  liable  to\nconfiscation&quot;  mandate\tthat  the  foreign  vessel  used  in\nconnection with the commission of the offence as soon as the\nmasters have  been convicted under section 10 or 11 or 12 of\nthe said  Act, shall  be confiscated or it is the discretion\nof the\tCourt to  order either\tfor release of the vessel or\nfor confiscation  of the  vessel together  with the fish and\nother equipment,  cargo and  fishing  gear  considering\t the\ngraveness of  the offence.  It has  been  strenuously  urged\nbefore us  that the  object of\tthe M.Z.I. Act is to prevent\npoaching of   fishes in the exclusive economic zone of India\nby foreign vessels without any licence or permit as required\nunder the  said Act. Section 10 provides that where a vessel\ncontravenes the provisions of Section 3. the owner or master\nof the\tvessel shall  be punishable  for imprisonment  for a\nterm not  exceeding 3  years or\t with a\t fine not  exceeding\nRs.15 lakhs;  where the contravention takes place in an area\nwithin the  exclusive economic zone of India, the punishment\nof fine will not exceed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">651</span>\nrupees ten lakhs. Similarly for contravention of licence the\npunishment of  fine will not exceed rupees ten lakhs whereas\nin case\t of contravention of the provisions of the permit in\nrespect of  the area  of operation or method of fishing, the\npunishment of  fine will not exceed rupees five lakhs and in\nany other case the punishment of fine will not exceed rupees\nfifty thousand.\t Referring to these provisions providing for\ndifferent kinds\t of penalty,  it has  been  urged  that\t the\nconfiscation of\t the vessel  for contravention of the permit\nis not\twarranted in  as much as the punishment provided for\nsuch contravention  u/s 12  is much less than the punishment\nprovided for  in respect of contravention of licence as well\nas contravention  of Section  3 of  the\t said  Act  It\thas,\ntherefore, been\t submitted that the provisions of Section 13\nof the said Act are not mandatory but directory. This leaves\noption to  the Court  to use its discretion to pass an order\nof confiscation\t of vessel in the facts and circumstances of\nthe case.  The trawlers\t in question  were chartered  by the\ncompany and the company duly obtained permit under Section 5\nof M.Z.I.  Act, 1981  for fishing in economic zones of India\nat a  depth of\tnot  less  than\t 40  fathoms.  It  has\tbeen\nsubmitted that\tit is not possible to fish at the said depth\nas depth  varies from  place to\t place and  for such a minor\ninfringement the  penalty of confiscation of the vessel i.e.\nthe fishing  trawlers should  not be awarded as the trawlers\nare fishing  in the  maritime zone  of\tIndia  under  permit\ngranted by  the Government  of India in favour of the Indian\ncompany which  chartered those trawlers. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1019036\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"936398\" id=\"span_7\">Moreover, different\npenalties are  prescribed for  different offences  committed\nunder sections\t10, 11 and 12 of M.Z.I. Act according to the\ngraveness of the offence. The penalty of confiscation of the\nvessel under  Section 13  if found  to\tbe  imperative,\t the\nprovisions will\t be arbitrary.\tThe  words  &quot;shall  also  be\nliable to  confiscation&quot; in  Section 13 of the said Act have\nto be  interpreted as not mandatory in the context they have\nbeen used but discretionary.

The objects and reasons of the Act are to\nbe taken  into consideration  in interpreting the provisions\nof the\tStatute and  not the  debates in  Parliament on\t the\nBill.

The  context seems  to require that it is not\n\t  open to  the Customs\tto refuse  to confiscate the\n\t  vessel  on   the  ground   that  there   are\t any\n\t  extenuating\t circumstances\t  surrounding\t the\n\t  contravention of  Section 52A\t in a given case and\n\t  that it  would be  unfair to impose the penalty of\n\t  confiscation. Two penalties are prescribed, one is\n\t  the confiscation  of the  ship, and the other is a\n\t  fine against\tthe master.  In regard to the latter\n\t  penalty it is within the discretion of the Customs\n\t  Authority to\tdecide what amount of penalty should\n\t  be imposed;  just as\tin the\tcase  of  the  first\n\t  penalty it is not open\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">656</span>\n\t  to it\t to say that it would not impose the penalty\n\t  of confiscation  against the offending ship, so in\n\t  the case  of the  second penalty it is not open to\n\t  it to\t say that  it  will  not  levy\tany  penalty\n\t  against the  master ..  It must  be regarded as an\n\t  elementary requirement  of clause 12A that as soon\n\t  as the offence referred to in column I of the said\n\t  clause is  proved, some  penalty has to be imposed\n\t  and clause  12A indicates  that two penalties have\n\t  to be\t imposed and  not one there being discretion\n\t  in regard  to the  penalty imposable\tagainst\t the\n\t  master as  regards the amount of the said penalty.\n\t  Therefore, we do not think it would be possible to\n\t  take\tthe  view  that\t if  there  are\t extenuating\n\t  circumstances\t attending   the  contravention\t  of\n\t  Section 52A  in a given case the Customs Authority\n\t  can  refrain\t from\tconfiscating   the   vessel.\n\t  Confiscation\tof   the  vessel  is  the  immediate\n\t  statutory  consequence  of  the  finding  that  an\n\t  offence under\t clause 12A  is established, just as\n\t  the imposition  of some penalty against the master\n\t  is  another  statutory  consequence  of  the\tsame\n\t  contravention.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">     Section  183  lays\t down  that  whenever  an  order  of\nconfiscation is\t made the Adjudicating Authority has to give\nthe owner  of  the  goods  which  includes  the\t vessel,  an\nopportunity to pay fine in lieu of confiscation.

Thirdly, if\nconfiscation was  obligatory under  the section, the section\nmay have  to be\t struck down  as  imposing  an\tunreasonable\nrestriction under <a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution .\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">     Section 11 of the Madhya Bharat Act is not therefore to\nbe construed  as obligatory  and it  is\t for  the  court  to\nconsider in  each case\twhether the  articles in  which\t the\ncontraband opium  is found or it being transported should be\nconfiscated or not having regard to all the circumstances of\nthe case.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">     The  earlier  decision  of\t this  Court  has  not\tbeen\nreferred to  in this  case. Moreover  what appears  to\thave\nweighed with  this court  was that  unless the\towner of the\ntruck  knew  that  hirer  used\tthe  truck  in\ttransporting\ncontraband opium  it  would  be\t unjust\t to  confiscate\t the\nconveyance. In\tthe instant case the owner of the vessel has\nbeen defined  in Section 2(i) of M.Z.I. Act as including any\nassociation of persons, whether incorporated or not, by whom\nthe vessel  is owned or chartered. The charterer company and\nits Managing Director, have been convicted for contravention\nof Section S of the Act and Rule 8(1)(q) of the Rules framed\nthereunder and\tpenalty has  been awarded.  So the charterer\nwho is deemed to be the owner of the trawler was held guilty\nof the offence of breach of terms of the permit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1034761\" id=\"span_18\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1034761/\" id=\"a_12\">Superintendent and Legal Remembrancer of\nLegal Affairs  to the  Govt. Of\t West Bengal v. Abani Haity</a>,\n[1979] 3  SCR 472  the car  belonging  to  Abani  Haity\t was\nsearched and contraband ganja was found concealed in the car\nowned  by  Abani  Haity.  The  Magistrate  passed  order  of\nconviction and\tsentence against him but he did not make any\norder for  confiscation of the car used for transporting the\ncontraband article.  This matter  ultimately came  up before\nthis Court in an appeal by special leave. This Court held on\nan interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/38941268/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 63(1)</a> of the Bengal Excise Act,\n1909 that  the words  &quot;shall be\t liable to  confiscaticn&quot; as\nused  in  the  context\tconvey\tan  absolute  imperative  to\nconfiscate the\tvehicle used for transport of the contraband\ngoods. It  was further\theld that  it is  incumbent  on\t the\nMagistrate to  pass, at\t the conclusion\t of  the  trial,  in\naddition  to  the  conviction  and  sentence.  an  order  of\nconfiscation of the car by which such offence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">658</span>\nhas been  committed. The  word &quot;liable&quot;\t occurring  in\tmany\nstatutes, has  been held  as not  conveying the\t sense of an\nabsolute  obligation  or  penalty  but\tmerely\timporting  a\npossibility of\tattracting such\t obligation, or penalty even\nwhere this  word is  used along\t with the  words &quot;shall be&quot;.\nThus, where  an American  Revenue Statute  declared that for\nthe commission\tof a  certain act, a vessel &quot;shall be liable\nto forfeiture&quot;,\t it has held that &quot;these words do not effect\na present  absolute forfeiture but only give a right to have\nthe vessel forfeited under due process of law. Similarly, it\nhas been  held that  in <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_14\">Section\t 302</a>, Indian Penal Code, the\nphrase, &quot;shall\talso be\t liable to  fine&quot; does\tnot convey a\nmandate\t but  leave  it\t to  the  discretion  of  the  Court\nconvicting an  accused of the offence of murder to impose or\nnot to\timpose fine  in addition to the sentence of death or\ntransportation for life.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_32\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1499936\" id=\"span_20\">In the  case of  <a href=\"/doc/1499936/\" id=\"a_15\">F.N.

The\ngoods on  arrival in Calcutta Port could not be cleared from\nthe Port  as a notice was issued by the Collector of Customs\nfor Appraisement stating that the petitioner did not possess\nvalid import  licence for  the goods  and asked\t him to show\ncause why  the same  should not\t be confiscated\t and  action\ntaken against  the petitioner  u/s 167(8) of the Sea Customs\nAct. The  petitioner submitted a written answer stating that\nthe Zip\t Chains imported by him were chains of the kind free\nimport of which has been permitted and as such no licence to\nimport them was necessary. The petitioner was again asked by\nthe  Customs   authorities  whether  he\t wanted\t a  personal\nhearing. The  petitioner did  not reply\t to  the  same.\t The\nCollector of Customs made an order confiscated the goods and\nimposing a  penalty  of\t Rs.1,000  on  the  petitioner.\t The\npetitioner thereafter filed an appeal which was dismissed on\nthe ground  that it was barred by limitation. The petitioner\nthereafter made\t an application\t for quashing  the order  of\nconfiscation of\t goods and  imposing penalty  on  him.\tThis\napplication was\t dismissed. The\t petitioner thereafter filed\nan  application\t  under\t <a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_16\">Article   32</a>  of  the\tConstitution\nchallenging the\t validity of the order made against him.

It\nwas held  that in view of the substitution of the word &#x27;may&#x27;\nin place  of &#x27;shall&#x27;  in Section 183 of the Sea Customs Act,\nit  has\t  been\tleft   to  the\tdiscretion  of\tthe  Customs\nAuthorities to give or not to give the option to payfine.
