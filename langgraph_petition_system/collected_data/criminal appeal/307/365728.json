Chava Pullaiah (accused No. 6) was further convicted under Section \n324 of the Penal Code and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a \nperiod of six months and to pay a fine of Rs. 100/-, in default to undergo rigorous \nimprisonment for a further period of one month.  All the sentences, however, \nwere ordered to run concurrently.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">The convicted accused persons preferred two appeals before the High \nCourt of Andhra Pradesh whereas an appeal was preferred by the State of \nAndhra Pradesh making a grievance that trial court was not justified in convicting \nthe accused under Section 304 Part I/149 of the Penal Code rather they should \nhave been convicted under Section 302/149 of the Penal Code.  Similar \ngrievance was made by Daruvuri Subbarao (PW 2), brother-in-law of the \ndeceased,  by filing a revision application before the High Court.   So far as \nconviction of Chava Ankama Rao (accused No. 1), Chava Bhadraiah (accused \nNo. 2), Chava Narasimha Rao (accused No. 3) and Vempati Prasad (accused \nNo. 9) is concerned, the High Court was of the view that the trial court committed \nan error in convicting them under Section 304 Part I/149 of the Penal Code.  \nAccordingly, they have been convicted under Section 302/149 of the Penal Code \nand sentenced  to undergo imprisonment for life.  Their conviction and sentence \nunder Section 148 of the Penal Code, however, have been confirmed.  So far as \nA-5, A-6, A-8 and A-10  are concerned, the High Court acquitted them of all the \ncharges.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\tAgainst the order of their conviction, A-1, A-2, A-3 and A-9 preferred \nappeal to this Court by special leave which gave rise to Criminal Appeal No. \n1122 of 2002, whereas the State of Andhra Pradesh preferred another appeal by \nspecial leave giving rise to Criminal Appeal No. 137 of 2004 against the order of \nacquittal of A-5, A-6, A-8 and A-10 who are respondent Nos. 1 to 4 respectively \nin the said appeal, and out of whom, as Vempati Venkateswarlu (respondent No. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">4) died during the pendency of the appeal, the same abated against him.  As \nsuch, the said appeal has to be considered only in relation to the remaining three \nrespondents. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">\tProsecution case, in short, was that on 21st June, 1993 at 7.25 p.m., one \nBolineni Raghavarao (deceased) and Daruvuri Subbarao (PW 2) were returning \non a scooter from nursing home situated near Tower Clock Centre, \nNarasaraopet, and when they reached near the Centre, all the eleven accused \npersons, armed with spears and coconut cutting knives, appeared,  surrounded \nthe deceased  and PW-2 and pounced upon the deceased, out of them, A-2 \nexhorted.  A-1, A-2, A-3, A-6 and A-9 assaulted the deceased with coconut \ncutting knives.  A-1 and A-2 assaulted on the head whereas A-3 on the right \nshoulder, A-6 on the right side of abdomen and A-9 on the right eyebrow.  When \nGannamneni Ramaiah (PW 1)  came to the rescue of the deceased, A-4 and A-6 \nassaulted him with coconut cutting knife.  Thereafter, A-5 assaulted the \ndeceased on his back by spear.  A-7 stabbed the deceased on his right hip.  A-8, \nA-10 and A-11  stabbed the deceased indiscriminately.  As a result of the \ninjuries, the deceased fell down and succumbed to his injuries.  Choppalli \nVenkateswara Rao (PW 3) and Bolineni Krishna (PW 4) also came to the place \nof occurrence and had also seen the occurrence.  Stating the aforesaid facts, a \nfirst information report was lodged at Narasaraopet Town police station on the \nsame day at 8.30 p.m. \n\n\tThe police after registering the case took up investigation and on \ncompletion thereof submitted chargesheet against all the eleven accused \npersons, on receipt whereof, the learned magistrate took cognizance and \ncommitted the accused persons to the Court of Session to face trial. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">\tDefence of the accused persons was that they were innocent, falsely \nimplicated in the present case and no occurrence, much less the occurrence \nalleged, had taken place.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">\tDuring trial, prosecution examined several witnesses and exhibited certain \ndocuments.  Defence in support of its case has not examined any witness.  As \nbefore the commencement of trial, accused Nos. 4 and 11 died and accused         \nNo. 7 remained absconder, the trial proceeded only against eight accused \npersons out of eleven.   Upon conclusion of trial, the trial court convicted eight \naccused persons, as stated above.  Thereafter, on appeals being preferred, while \nmaintaining their conviction under Section 148 of the Penal Code, the High Court \nmodified conviction of four appellants of Criminal Appeal No. 1122 of 2002 from \n304 Part I/149 of the Penal Code to 302/149 of the Penal Code and acquitted the \nother four accused persons, which is subject matter of challenge by the State of \nAndhra Pradesh in Criminal Appeal No. 137 of 2004 and as Respondent No. 4 of \nthe said appeal died during the pendency of the appeal, the same abated against \nhim. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">\tProsecution, in support of its case, examined four eyewitnesses in all, \nnamely, Gannamneni Ramaiah (PW 1), Daruvuri Subbarao (PW 2), Choppalli \nVenkateswara Rao (PW 3) and Bolineni Krishna (PW 4), out of whom PW-1 is \nthe informant himself.  He is an injured witness.  His injuries were examined by             \nDr. I.Jagannadha Reddy (PW 12) who found five injuries on different parts of his \nbody.  PW.1 is an independent villager and the prosecution case disclosed by \nhim is supported by his subsequent statement made before the police as well as \nin court.  He has supported the prosecution case in all material particulars and no \ninfirmity could be pointed out in his evidence.  PW-2 is nobody else than brother-\nin-law of the deceased.  He had also gone to the police station along  with PW-1 \nto lodge the first information report.  He was accompanying the deceased on the \nscooter.  His presence at the place of occurrence cannot be doubted.   He has \nconsistently supported the prosecution case in his statement made before the \npolice as well as in court.  The only ground of attack to his evidence was that he \nwas related to the deceased.  It is well settled that if  evidence of a witness is \notherwise trustworthy, merely because he is  relation of the deceased, his \nevidence cannot be doubted.  PWs 3 and 4 also claimed to be eyewitnesses to \nthe occurrence and they have consistently supported the prosecution case in all \nmaterial particulars.  These two witnesses are independent villagers and no \ninfirmity could be pointed out in  their evidence. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">\tComing now to the medical evidence,  the doctor who held postmortem \nexamination on the dead body of Bolineni Raghavarao  found fifteen injuries.  In \nthe opinion of the doctor, the same were caused by coconut cutting knife as well \nas spear.  According to the postmortem report, two of the injuries on the head \nwere fatal which are said to have been caused by A-1 and A-2.  The postmortem \nreport supports the prosecution case of inflicting injuries by the four appellants of \nCriminal Appeal No. 1122 of 2002 and in our view the High Court has not \ncommitted any error in convicting them under Section 302/149 of the Penal \nCode. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">\tTurning now to the State&#x27;s appeal,  i.e., Criminal Appeal No. 137 of 2004, \nas respondent No. 4 died during the pendency of the appeal, we are required to \nconsider cases of remaining three respondents, namely, Chava Sreenu \n(respondent No. 1), Chava Pullaiah (respondent No. 2) and Vempati Narayana \n(respondent No. 3).  Out of these respondents, so far as respondent No. 1 is \nconcerned, according to the prosecution case and evidence, he stabbed the \ndeceased on his back with a spear but curiously enough, the doctor did not find \nany injury on the back of the deceased.  So far as respondent No.2 is concerned, \nthe allegations are that he inflicted injury in the stomach of the deceased with a \ncoconut cutting knife but the doctor found  injury in the stomach of the deceased \ncaused by spear and no injury was found in the stomach  by coconut cutting \nknife.  From the aforesaid facts, as the prosecution case in relation to these two \nrespondents is falsified by the postmortem report, the High Court recorded their \nacquittal.  We find that the view taken by the High Court was not only possible \nbut reasonable one and the same cannot be said to be perverse in any manner \nso as to be interfered with by this Court in exercise of powers under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 136</a> of \nthe Constitution. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_12\">\tNow remains the case of respondent No. 3 (A-8).  The High Court \nrecorded his acquittal by committing an error of record as if there was no \nallegation against him, which is factually incorrect.  According to the first \ninformation report, A-8 stabled the deceased indiscriminately.  PWs 1, 2 and 3 \nconsistently stated that A-8 along with others surrounded the deceased and \nstabbed him.  PW-4 specifically stated that A-8 assaulted the deceased with \nknife.  These facts clearly show that A-8 assaulted the deceased and statements \nof prosecution witnesses are consistent with the prosecution case disclosed in \nthe first information report and the High Court has committed an error while \nacquitting this respondent stating that there was no allegation against him.   As \nsuch, we are of the view that this respondent is also liable to be convicted under \nSection 302/149 of the Penal Code along with the appellants of Criminal Appeal \nNo. 1122 of 2002. In view of the foregoing discussion, we are of the view that the \nprosecution has succeeded in proving its case beyond reasonable doubt against \nappellants of Criminal Appeal No. 1122 of 2002 and respondent No. 3 \u0016 Vempati \nNarayana of Criminal Appeal No. 137 of 2004 as all of them committed an \noffence punishable under Section 302/149 of the Penal Code.  \nAccordingly, Criminal Appeal No. 1122 of 2002 is dismissed.   Criminal \nAppeal No. 137 of 2004 is dismissed in relation to Chava Sreenu (respondent \nNo. 1) and Chava Pullaiah (respondent No. 2) and so far as Vempati \nVenkateswarlu (respondent No. 4) is concerned, the same abated against him as \nhe died during the pendency of the appeal.   The appeal against respondent No. \n3 \u0016 Vempati Narayana is allowed,  the order of acquittal rendered by the High \nCourt in relation to him is set aside and he is convicted under Section 302/149 of \nthe Penal Code and sentenced to undergo imprisonment for life.  He is further \nconvicted under Section 148 of the Penal Code and sentenced to undergo \nrigorous imprisonment for a period of one year.  Both the sentences, however, \nshall run concurrently.  Bail bonds of this respondent are cancelled and he is \ndirected to be taken into custody forthwith to serve out the remaining period of \nsentence for which  compliance report must be sent to this Court within a period \nof one month from the date of receipt of  order by the trial court.  \n</p>\n","numcites":1,"numcitedby":30,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":365728,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"304 part i","formInput":"304%20part%20i"},{"value":"coconut      ","formInput":"coconut%20%20%20%20%20%20"},{"value":"abatment","formInput":"abatment"},{"value":"section 304","formInput":"section%20304"},{"value":"section 149  ","formInput":"section%20149%20%20"},{"value":"spear","formInput":"spear"}],"cats":[{"value":"special-leave-appeal-by-supreme-court","formInput":"tag:special-leave-appeal-by-supreme-court"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
