We,      in     evaluating    the\n              circumstantial evidence available on\n              record on different aspects of the case,\n              shall at the foremost watchfully examine\n              whether the accused 1 to 3 had\n              developed      bad-blood    against   the\n\n\n              deceased to the extent of silencing her\n              for ever, that too in a very inhuman and\n              horrendous manner. The appellant wants\n              us to infer that the deceased should\n\n\n\n\n              have been subjected to all kinds of\n              pressures      and    harassments     and\n              compelled to institute the suit against\n\n\n\n\n\n              her father and brother claiming\n              exclusive right over the landed property\n              in order to grab the said property, that\n              this conduct of the accused should have\n\n\n\n\n\n              been resented by the deceased and that\n              on that score the accused should have\n              decided to put an end to her life. In our\n              view, this submission has no merit\n              because there is no acceptable evidence\n              showing that there was any quarrel in\n              the family and that the deceased was ill-\n              treated either by her husband or in-laws.\n              The appellate Court while dealing with\n              this aspect of the case has observed that\n              there is no evidence that the accused ill-\n              treated the deceased, which observation\n              we have extracted above. Hence, we\n              hold that there is no sufficient material\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                       ::: Downloaded on - 16/05/2019 21:58:44 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                    24</span>\n\n\n        to warrant a conclusion that the accused\n        had any motive to snatch away the life\n        threat of the deceased. There is no\n        denying the fact that the deceased did\n        not accompany her husband and in-laws\n        to attend the marriage celebrated in the\n        house of PW-1 and remained in the\n\n\n\n\n                                                     .\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">        scene house and that she has been done\n\n\n\n\n\n        away with on the intervening night of\n        6th/7th September, 1985. From this\n        circumstance, the Court will not be\n        justified in drawing any conclusion that\n        the deceased was not leading a happy\n\n\n\n\n\n        marital life. As observed by the appellate\n        Court, the explanation offered by\n        accused 1 to 3 that they remained in the\n        house of PW 1 throughout the night is\n        too big a pill to be swallowed. But at the\n        same     time,     in   our   view,    this\n\n\n\n\n\n        unacceptable explanation would not lead\n        to any irrestible inference that the\n        accused alone should have committed\n        this murder and have come forward with\n        this false explanation. We have no\n        hesitation in coming to the conclusion\n\n        that it is a case of murder but not a\n\n        suicide as we have pointed out supra.\n        The placing of the tin container with the\n        inscription &#x27;Democran, by the side of the\n        dead body is nothing but a planted one\n        so as to give a misleading impression\n        that the deceased had consumed poison\n\n\n        and committed suicide. But there is no\n        evidence as to who had placed the tin\n        container by the side of the dead body.\n        Even if we hold that the perpetrators of\n        the crime whoever might have been had\n\n\n\n\n        placed the tin, that in the absence of any\n        satisfactory     evidence    against    the\n        accused would not lead to any inference\n\n\n\n\n\n        that these accused or any of them should\n        have done it. It is the admitted case that\n        the first accused handed over three\n        letters Ex. P. 6 to P. 8 alleged to have\n\n\n\n\n\n        been written by the deceased to the\n        Investigating Officer. The sum and\n        substance of these letters are to the\n        effect that the deceased had some\n        grouse against her parents and that the\n        accused were not responsible for her\n        death. The explanation given by accused\n        No. 1 in this written statement is that by\n        about the time of the arrival of the\n        police, one Sathi Prasad Reddy handed\n        over these letters to him saying that he\n        (Reddy) found them near the place\n        where the dead body was laid and that\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                  ::: Downloaded on - 16/05/2019 21:58:44 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                     25</span>\n\n\n                         he (A-1) in turn handed over them to the\n                         police.

Juris. 2nd\n\n           edn. Vol. 29, p. 429.)\n\n            There are three objections which are\n        usually advanced against the reception\n        of such evidence. First, since it is\n        manifest that the dog cannot go into the\n\n\n        box and give his evidence on oath, and\n        consequently submit himself to cross-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">        examination,      the   dog    s    human\n        companion must go into the box and\n        report the dog s evidence, and this is\n\n\n\n\n        clearly hearsay. Secondly, there is a\n        feeling that in criminal cases the life and\n        liberty of a human being should not be\n\n\n\n\n\n        dependent on canine inferences. And,\n        thirdly, it is suggested that even if such\n        evidence is strictly admissible under the\n        rules of evidence it should be excluded\n\n\n\n\n\n        because it is likely to have a dramatic\n        impact on the jury out of proportion to\n        its value. In R. v. Montgomery,1866 NI\n        160 a police constable observed men\n        stealing wire by the side of a railway\n        line. They ran away when he approached\n        them. Shortly afterwards the police got\n        them on a nearby road. About an hour\n        and half later the police tracker dog was\n        taken to the base of the telegraph pole\n        and when he had made a few\n        preliminary sniffs he set off and tracked\n        continuously until he stopped in evident\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                  ::: Downloaded on - 16/05/2019 21:58:44 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                    29</span>\n\n\n        perplexity at the spot where the accused\n        had been put into the police car. At the\n        trial it appeared that other evidence\n        against the accused that they had been\n        stealing the wire was inconclusive and\n        that the evidence of the behaviour of the\n        tracker dog was crucial to sustain the\n\n\n\n\n                                                    .\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_84\">        conviction. In these circumstances the\n\n\n\n\n\n        Court of Criminal Appeal ruled that the\n        evidence of the constable who handled\n        the dog on its tracking and reported the\n        dog s reactions was properly admitted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">        The Court did not regard its evidence as\n\n\n\n\n\n        a species of hearsay but instead the dog\n        was described as &quot;a tracking instrument\n        and the handler was regarded as\n        reporting the movements of the\n        instrument, in the same way that a\n        constable in traffic case might have\n\n\n\n\n\n        reported on the behaviour of his\n        speedometer. It was argued in that case\n        that the tracker dog s evidence could be\n        likened to the type of evidence accepted\n        from     scientific  experts   describing\n        chemical reactions, blood tests and the\n\n        actions of bacilli. The comparison does\n\n        not, however, appear to be sound\n        because the behaviour of chemicals,\n        blood corpuscles and bacilli contains no\n        element of conscious volition or\n        deliberate choice. But Dogs are\n        intelligent animals with many thought\n\n\n        processes similar to the thought\n        processes of human beings and\n        wherever you have thought processes\n        there is always the risk of error,\n        deception and even self-deception. For\n\n\n\n\n        these reasons we are of the opinion that\n        in the present state of scientific\n        knowledge evidence of dog tracking,\n\n\n\n\n\n        even if admissible, is not ordinarily of\n        much weight.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_86\">            It is submitted by learned Counsel\n\n\n\n\n\n        for the appellant that in the said case\n        this Court had upheld the conviction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">        Though in the said case the conviction\n        was upheld, but that was done after\n        excluding the evidence of Dog Squad.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">        This Court found that the rest of the\n        prosecution evidence proved the charges\n        for which the appellants therein had\n        been convicted.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                 ::: Downloaded on - 16/05/2019 21:58:44 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                      30</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">22.

After touching the different facets relating to the law laid\n\ndown by Hon&#x27;ble Courts on the subject of circumstantial evidence, the\n\ntestimonies of the prosecution witnesses need discussion and analysis.

In the present case, the deceased was having strained\n\nrelations with the accused and that on account thereof, accused\n\n\n\n\ncommitted the offence.     The prosecution has placed reliance upon the\n\n\n\n\n\nstatements of PW-1, Bimla Devi, PW-3, Salochana Devi, PW-6, Vidya\n\n\n\n\n\nChand, (son of the deceased) and PW-21, Dasuri Devi. PW-1, Bimla Devi,\n\ndeposed that about one and half month prior to the incidence, her mother\n\ntold her that accused caught her from her arm and leg and she narrated\n\nthis fact to PW-2, Salochana Devi.      She also deposed in her statement\n\nEx.PW1/A, recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 154</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n\nby PW-24, SI Mast Ram, on the basis of which FIR, Ex.PW23/F was\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 16/05/2019 21:58:44 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                     31</span>\n\n\nregistered.

He further deposed that PW-21,\n\nDasuri Devi, also told that once the accused put his hand between the\n\nbuttocks of his mother, matter had also been reported to Pradhan,\n\n\n\n\n\nSalochana Devi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">25.         From the above evidence, it is clear that the relations\n\nbetween the accused and the deceased were strained and the accused\n\nwas having motive to harm the deceased.           Now, after taking into\n\nconsideration the statement of prosecution witnesses, as has been\n\n\ndiscussed hereinabove, it has come on record that on 18.12.2011, during\n\nday time, accused consumed liquor in the company of PW-8, Surat\n\n\n\n\nBahadur and two other persons after having consumed liquor, the accused\n\n\n\n\n\ngiven vent to his anger by saying that he would see the deceased on that\n\nday.   PW-2, Yum Dolma, deposed that she knows Ram Rattan, father of\n\n\n\n\n\nthe accused and he was step son of the deceased. So, if the nature of the\n\nstand taken by the accused, while cross-examination, is taken into\n\nconsideration, then it could be held that the accused did not deny that the\n\ndeceased was related to her like a grandmother.         This aspect of the\n\nstatement made by this witness leaves no doubt to hold that the accused\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 16/05/2019 21:58:44 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                      32</span>\n\n\nwhile leaving the house of PW-8, Surat Bahadur, made reference to the\n\ndeceased, when he used the words dadi.           It is further case of the\n\nprosecution that on the next day of occurrence, when the accused saw\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_94\">that many persons gathered outside the house of the deceased, he got\n\n\n\n\n\nscared and fled away from his house and stayed during night at Panpo\n\n\n\n\n\nKanda.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_95\">26.           After analyzing the prosecution witnesses, it is clear that the\n\nprosecution succeeded in proving that on the next day of incidence, when\n\n\n\n\n\nthe accused saw many persons gathered outside the house of the\n\ndeceased, he fled away from his house.           PW-7, Bharat Singh, also\n\nsupported the case of prosecution by stating that the police effected\n\nsearch of the house of the accused and he was not found in his house. In\n\nfact, PW-24, SI Mast Ram, after effecting recovery of the articles from the\n\n\nhouse of the deceased and after preparing inquest papers gone to the\n\nhouse of the accused and was not found in his house. It appears that\n\n\n\n\nhaving realized the consequences of his act committed on the previous\n\n\n\n\n\nnight, the accused got scared and run away to avoid his apprehension by\n\nthe police.    So, the aforesaid previous conduct of the accused in\n\n\n\n\n\nproclaiming the presence of PW-8, Surat Bahadur that he would see the\n\ndeceased and his subsequent conduct in fleeing from his house soon after\n\nhaving came to know about the death of the deceased is relevant under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 8</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, which inter alia provides that\n\nprevious or subsequent conduct of any person, an offence against whom is\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                                  ::: Downloaded on - 16/05/2019 21:58:44 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                       33</span>\n\n\nthe subject of any proceedings is relevant, if such conduct is influenced by\n\nany fact in issue or relevant fact.    PW-1, Bimla Devi, PW-3, Salochana\n\nDevi, PW-5, Medup Chhering and PW-9, HC Puran Singh, while deposing\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    .\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">that at the time of inspecting the place of incidence, the police found\n\n\n\n\n\nseeds of cannabis and powder leaves of cannabis from the room of the\n\n\n\n\n\ndeceased, thereafter, put into match box and sealed with seal impression\n\nM. The prosecution also produced parcel Ex.P-3, in sealed condition and\n\nafter opening the parcel, match box, Ex.P-1, containing seeds of cannabis,\n\n\n\n\n\nEx.P-2 and cannabis leaves, Ex.P-4, were found therein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_97\">27.          All these circumstances were fortified by the extra judicial\n\nconfession made by the accused to PW-7, Bharat Singh. Now, it is clear\n\nthat it is the accused, who has caused the death of the deceased, but\n\nwhether it is culpable homicide amounting to murder or culpable homicide\n\n\nnot amounting to murder is to be concluded on the basis of evidence,\n\nwhich has come on record.       From the injuries on the person of the\n\n\n\n\ndeceased and the manner those were caused and the intention of the\n\n\n\n\n\naccused i.e. to rape the deceased and on account of fall goes to show that\n\nthe injuries were caused, which were not sufficient, in all probabilities to\n\n\n\n\n\nresult into the death of the deceased.     At the same point of time, the\n\nintention was also not there to cause the death of the deceased. So, it is\n\nclear that the accused has committed culpable homicide of the deceased\n\nnot amounting to murder and so, the view taken by the learned Trial Court\n\nholding him guilty accordingly cannot be said erroneous and the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 16/05/2019 21:58:44 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                      34</span>\n\n\nsubmissions made by the learned Additional Advocate General that the\n\naccused be convicted for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 302</a> of the\n\nIndian Penal Code, required to be rejected and is accordingly rejected.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">                                                                    .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_99\">28.          As far as the offence under Section 376 read with <a href=\"/doc/1185693/\" id=\"a_31\">Section\n\n\n\n\n\n511</a> of the Indian Penal Code is concerned, the prosecution has proved the\n\n\n\n\n\nguilt of the accused, as the dead body of the deceased was lying naked\n\nand it was the accused who made the deceased naked with the purpose to\n\nrape her, but he could not succeed, as his male organ could not erect, so\n\n\n\n\n\nthere was definitely attempt to commit the rape.        In view of this, as\n\ndiscussed hereinabove, no interference is required in the view taken by\n\nthe learned Trial Court while convicting the accused for the commission of\n\noffence punishable under Section 304 and Section 376 read with <a href=\"/doc/1185693/\" id=\"a_32\">Section\n\n511</a> of the Indian Penal Code.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">29.          In view of what has been discussed hereinabove, in a nut\n\nshell it can be said safely that the prosecution has successfully proved the\n\n\n\n\nguilt of the accused conclusively and beyond the shadow of reasonable\n\n\n\n\n\ndoubt. Therefore, the only conclusion is that the learned Trial Court has\n\nrightly appreciated the evidence to its true and correct perspective and\n\n\n\n\n\nrightly convicted the accused. We find no reason to reverse the findings of\n\nconviction recorded by learned trial Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">30.          Now, if coming to the quantum of sentence, 10 years\n\nrigorous imprisonment for the commission of the offence punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 304</a> IPC and to pay fine of Rs. 5,000/-, in the given facts and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                                 ::: Downloaded on - 16/05/2019 21:58:44 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                      35</span>\n\n\ncircumstances of this case is on higher side.       As per the prosecution\n\nevidence itself i.e. the confessional statement Ext. PW-7/A and also the\n\nstatement Ext. PW-7/C of Bharat Singh recorded under Section 164 Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_102\">                                                                      .\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_103\">who is author of the confessional statement Ext. PW-7/A supra, the\n\n\n\n\n\nintention of the accused was not to do away with the life of the deceased\n\n\n\n\n\nbut also to assault her sexually. As per further case of the prosecution,\n\nhe, however, failed in his attempt to assault her sexually on account of\n\nnon-erection of his penis.    The present, as such, is a case which falls\n\n\n\n\n\nunder IInd part of <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 304</a> IPC. The accused was arrested in this case\n\non 20.12.2011. The record reveals that he remained in custody during the\n\ncourse of trial. Even after his conviction and sentence also, he is in jail\n\nundergoing the sentence imposed upon him.                He, therefore, has\n\nundergone the sentence for a period over 7 years i.e. 7 years and 4-5\n\n\nmonths. We find the present a case where the sentence imposed upon\n\nthe appellant-convict does not commensurate vis-à-vis the nature of the\n\n\n\n\noffence he committed. Therefore, the sentence he has already undergone\n\n\n\n\n\nwould serve the ends of justice.          The appeal, though is dismissed,\n\nhowever, impugned judgment is modified only to the extent that the\n\n\n\n\n\nappellant-convict if not required in any other case, be set free forthwith.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_104\">31.          In view of the findings recorded hereinabove, we find no\n\nmerits in the connected appeal Cr. Appeal No. 207 of 2017 preferred by\n\nthe State of Himachal Pradesh for the reason that no case for\n\nenhancement of the sentence imposed upon the appellant-convict has\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 16/05/2019 21:58:44 :::HCHP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                    36</span>\n\n\nbeen made out and rather the period he has already undergone has been\n\nheld by us as adequate to meet the ends of justice.
