Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that as per prosecution\ncase, 17 persons allegedly participated in the incident of assaulting three\ndeceased.

But their\nstatements are not corroborate from the medical evidence regarding\nparticipating of seventeen persons in the incident. They all belongs to kori\ncommunity and therefore partisan witnesses. From the statements of these\nwitnesses, it is clear that they were not in a position to identify the assailants.\nThe incident allegedly occurred at 6 PM after sunset in winter season when\ndarkness falls early in the evening. Therefore, it would not be possible for\nthe witnesses to ascribe the overt acts of each accused on account of the\nprevailing darkness which shows that all witnesses have given false\nstatement regarding involvement of the appellants in the incident. There are\nmany contradictions and omissions in their statement regarding incident, so\ntheir statements are unreliable.

Learned Trial\nJudge without appreciating all these facts wrongly found the appellants\nmember of unlawful assembly which was prepared for committing the\naforesaid offences. He further submitted that the incident occurred without\nany premeditation due to a petty quarrel. The common object, if any, was to\ngive a good thrashing to the member of the opposite party. This would only\nmake the persons of the unlawful assembly liable for an offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_35\">149</a> of IPC.

On the other hand, learned counsel for the respondent/State has\nvehemently opposed the submissions of the counsel for the appellants and\nfully supported the judgment of the Trial Court and submitted that from the\nprosecution evidence the guilt of the appellant is clearly proved.

Other accused Shriram, Ramadhar, Shravan and Kaidilal armed\nwith sticks, first hit Bhaiyalal thereafter other accused assaulted him. At that\ntime, Thakurdeen and Ramesh came there. All appellants assaulted them\ntoo. Appellant Ramadhar assaulted Thakurdeen by iron pipe, Ramadhar used\nrod, Rajendra and Puranlal assaulted him with stick on his head and other\nappellants also assaulted him.

Appellants also assaulted Belia, Savita, Lalita, Shyamabai,\nTara and Ramsajivan. They also sustained injury. He also sustained two lathi\nblows.

Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that all eye witnesses\nbelong to a particular community and are relatives, no independent witness\nis produced by the prosecution to prove its case.

The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court also in the case of Mallanna and others V/s.\nState of Karnataka reported in (2007) 8 SCC 523 held that,\n\n      &quot;Merely because of the witnesses being related or interested or not\n      injured, their evidence cannot be discarded if same is otherwise found\n      to be credible, especially when they have supported the prosecution\n      case in material particulars.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">24.   So on the ground that prosecution witnesses Kamal Prasad (P.W.1),\nTaradevi (P.W.3), Lalita (P.W.4), Savita (P.W.5), Chotku Lodhi (P.W.6) and\nVinod Kumar (P.W.16) are relatives or belongs to same community and no\nother independent witness has been produced by the prosecution to prove its\ncase, their statement regarding incident which is also corroborated from\nmedical and other evidence can not be disbelieved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_49\">25.   Learned counsel for the appellants also submitted that there are many\ncontradictions in the statements of the eyewitness on the point that on what\npart of the body of the deceased did each accused individually hit. It also\nappears from their statements that they did not see the incident. Kamal\nPrasad (P.W.1), deposed that he reached at the spot on hearing the shouts,\nwhich clearly shows that this witness reached       the spot after incident and\ndid not see the incident. Ramakant (P.W.2) deposed that when appellants ran\ntowards him for assaulting him, he entered into his house to save himself\nwhich shows that at the time of incident, this witness was also not present on\nthe spot. Likewise, Tara Devi (P.W.3) stated that in the incident she sustained\ninjury on her right leg which is not mentioned in her MLC report (Ex.P/31).\nLalita (P.W.4) deposed that Rajendra assaulted her by stick. She sustained\ninjury on her leg, while in her MLC report (Ex.P/29) there is no mention of\nany external injury being found on her body. Savita (PW.5) also stated that\nshe did not see Tara Devi sustaining injury on any body part. Savita (P.W.5)\nand Vinod (PW/16) stated that they could not see who assaulted Tara Devi,\nLalita, Ramsajivan in the incident. Chotku Lodhi (P.W.6) admitted in his\nstatement that when he reached the spot all appellants were assaulting\nBhaiyalal, Thakurdeen and Ramesh while according to prosecution case,\nappellants first assaulted Bhaiyalal thereafter when Thakurdeen and Ramesh\ncame to the spot, they assaulted Thakurdeen and Ramesh. which shows that\nall these witness also did not see the incident. He further submits that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                                   17</span>\n                                            Cr.A.No.1373/2005, 1419/2005 &amp; 1584/2005\n\nincident allegedly occurred at 6 pm after sunset in winter season when\ndarkness falls early in the evening. Therefore, it could not have been\npossible for the witnesses to identify all appellants due to the prevailing\ndarkness which shows that all witnesses were giving false statements\nregarding involvement of the appellants in the incident. Learned Trial Court\ncommitted mistake in relying on the statement of these witnesses. But this\nargument also has no force.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">26.   Although, the incident occurred at 6 PM in winter season in the month\nof November when darkness falls early in the evening but Appellants and\neyewitnesses were familiar with each other. They are neighbours so they\ncould easily identify appellants.     Likewise, in the statements of the\neyewitness there are contradictions on the point that who hit         what body\npart of the deceased and inflicted injury thereon and there is also some\nexaggeration regarding incident but where many accused were assaulting\nthree or more people it is not always possible to tell exactly identify the\novert act of each individual and      on that ground also their statements\ncannot be discarded. The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of Gosu Jairam\nReddy &amp; another V/s. State of A.P. (Supra) held that,\n\n      &quot;Discrepancy in ocular evidence and medical evidence - How\n      to appreciate? It is not always easy for an eyewitness to a\n      ghastly murder to register the precise number of injuries that\n      were caused by the accused and the part of the body on which\n      the same were caused - A witness who is terrorized by the\n      brutality of the attack cannot be disbelieved only because in his\n      description of who hit the deceased on what part of the body\n      there is some mix up or confusion - It is the totality of the\n      evidence on record and its credibility that would eventually\n      determine whether the prosecution has proved the charge\n      against the accused.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">27.   The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of Bhajan Singh @ Harbhajan\nSingh &amp; others V/s. State of Haryana (Supra) also held that,\n\n      &quot;The testimony of an injured witness is accorded a special\n      status in law.Such a witness comes with a built-in guarantee of\n      his presence at the scene of the crime and is unlikely to spare\n      his actual assailant in order to falsely implicate someone.\n      Convincing evidence is required to discredit an injured witness.\n      Thus, the evidence of an injured witness should be relied upon\n      unless there are grounds for the rejection of his evidence on the\n      basis of major contradictions and discrepancies therein&quot;.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                                    18</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">                                             Cr.A.No.1373/2005, 1419/2005 &amp; 1584/2005\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">28.   In a case like at hand, where three persons died on the spot and other\nreceived injuries, the eye witnesses also made an attempt to save themselves\nand rescue the persons under attack in such a fact-situation, the witness is\nnot supposed to be perfectionist to give the exact account of the incident.\nSome sort of contradiction, improvement, embellishment is bound to occur\nin his statement. There are no important contradictions and omissions in the\nstatement of Kamal Prasad (P.W.1), Ramakant (PW/2), Taradevi (P.W.3),\nLalita (P.W.4), Savita (P.W.5), and Vinod Kumar (P.W.16). In the incident\nTaradevi (P.W.3) and Savita (P.W.5) also sustained injuries which shows that\nthey were present at the time of incident. Their statement is also\ncorroborated by the medical evidence and also other circumstantial\nevidence. The incident occurred at 6 PM and Kamal Prasad (P.W.1) lodged\nthe report soon after the incident at 6:50 PM and in the report name of all the\nappellants are mentioned. So there is no reason to discard their statements.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_54\">29.   Although, appellants Sarman and Shriram took defence that at the\ntime of incident, they were not present at the spot and also produced\nHarprasad Vishwakarma (D.W.1) and Phool Chand Kushwaha (D.W.2) in\ntheir defence. Harprasad (D.W.1) deposed that on the date of incident\nappellant Pooran and Babulal came to his house. He went with him to\nKorbara and then they went to Phool Chand&#x27;s house where they were playing\ncards up to 10 PM and Phool Chand Kushwaha (D.W.2) deposed that on the\ndate of incident, Pooranlal, Babulal and Lalley Vishwakarma came to his\nhouse at 11 AM in the morning and stayed at his home up to 9 PM.\nLikewise, appellants Gorelal, Rajaram, Kunjilal and Ashok also took the\ndefence that at the time of incident they were at Village Korbara and also\nproduced Dhaniram (D.W.3) and Badri Prasad Patel (D.W.4). In this regard,\nthey deposed that on the date of incident, ie next day of Diwali, Gorelal,\nRajaram, Ashok and Kunjilal came to Village Korbara where they were\nplaying cards up to 7 PM but the appellants Pooranlal and Babulal did not\ngive any suggestion to eye witnesses of the incident that they were present\nwith Harprasad Vishwakarma (D.W.1) and Phoolchand (D.W.2) at the time\nof incident and appellants Gorelal, Rajaram, Kunjilal and Ashok also did\nnot give any suggestion to the eye witnesses of the incident that at the time\nof incident they were present with Dhaniram (D.W.3) and Badri Prasad Patel\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                                    19</span>\n                                             Cr.A.No.1373/2005, 1419/2005 &amp; 1584/2005\n\n(D.W.4). Even, in their examination under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 313</a> of CrPC they did not\ndisclose this fact that at the time of incident they were with above mentioned\ndefence witnesses. So in this regard, statement of Harprasad (D.W.1) and\nPhool Chand (D.W.2) Dhaniram (D.W.3) and Badri Prasad Patel (D.W.4)\nappear to be afterthought and only on the basis of their statements the\nstatements of eyewitnesses that these appellants also took part in the incident\ncannot be discarded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">30.   Learned counsel for the appellant also submitted that only on the\nground that appellants were present on spot, it cannot be said that they were\nall members of unlawful assembly because there are many contradiction and\nomission in the statements of eyewitnesses regarding the act of appellant.\nAccording to P.M. reports of deceased Ramesh, Bhaiyalal and Thakurdeen\nthey died due to head injuries and they sustained injuries in his head by\nsharp cutting object as mentioned in the injury reports of Ramesh and\nThakurdeen (Ex.P/32 and ExP/33) and P.M. report of Bhaiyalal (Ex.P/25).\nSo other appellants who were allegedly armed with hard and blunt object\nlike stick, rod and pipe at the time of incident cannot be held liable for\nmurdering the deceased persons. But these arguments also have no force.\nFrom the statement of eyewitness of the incident Kamal Prasad (P.W.1),\nRamakant (PW/2), Tara Devi (P.W.3), Lalita (P.W.4), Savita (P.W.5) and\nVinod (P.W.6) it is clear that all appellants were present on the spot armed\nwith sword/pipe/rod/stick and took part in the incident which clearly shows\nthat all appellants were the members of the unlawful assembly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"938573\" id=\"span_19\">31.

From the statements of prosecution witnesses Kamal Prasad (P.W.1),\nRamakant (PW/2), Taradevi (P.W.3), Lalita (P.W.4), Savita (P.W.5), and\nVinod Kumar (P.W.16) which is also corroborated from other evidence it is\nclearly proved that out of the appellants accused Bablu @ Jamuna armed\nwith sword Ramadhar with Iron Pipe, Shriram with Iron Rod, Pooran Lal\nKushwaha Hockey Stick and other appellants Gorelal, Rajaram Kushwaha,\nBabulal Kushwah, Kunjilal Kushwah, Javendra Kushwah, Kaidilal\nKushwah, Bundilal Kushwah, Rajendra Kushwaha, Shravan Kumar\nKushwaha, Ashoke armed with stick gathered on the spot with intention to\nkill Ramesh, Bhaiyalal and Thakurdeen and caused the injuries to Taradevi\n(P.W.3) and Savita (P.W.5), Beliya and Ramsajivan and due to which,\ndeceased Ramesh, Bhaiyalal, Thakurdeen died and Taradevi (P.W.3) and\nSavita (P.W.5) Beliya and Ramsajivan sustained injuries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">36.    But as far as findings of trial court regarding Lalita and Rajendra\nKumar sustaining injury in the incident is concerned,          Although Lalita\n(PW4) deposed that appellant Rajendra assaulted her by stick and she\nsustained injury in her leg but Dr.Abhay Raj (PW/8) who conducted medical\nexamination of Lalita deposed that on her examination he did not find any\ninjury on her body. Had appellants also assaulted Lalita by stick in the\nincident she must have sustained external injury on her leg.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">37.    Regarding Rajendra although Dr. R N sharma deposed that on 15-11-\n2016 at 9:30 pm he examined Rajendra Kumar and found following external\ninjuries on his body:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">(i)    Abrasion size 4&quot; x ½ &quot;x bone deep over left side of head.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">(ii)   Contusion reddish in colour size 6&quot; x 2&quot; inch over left scapula. both\nthe injuries are caused by hard and blunt object and within 24 hours from the\nexamination and simple in nature.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">38.    But prosecution did not produce Rajendra. In the evidence Ramakant\n(PW/2), Tara Devi (P.W.3), Lalita (P.W.4), Savita (P.W.5) Chotku (PW/6)\nand Vinod (P.W.16) did not depose that Rajendra Kumar was also present on\nthe spot at the time of incident and he sustained injury in the incident. Only\nKamal Prasad (PW/1) deposed that Rajendra also sustained injury in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                                     22</span>\n                                              Cr.A.No.1373/2005, 1419/2005 &amp; 1584/2005\n\nincident. But he also did not disclose as who inflicted injury to Rajendra and\nwhere if Rajendra had sustained injuries in the incident Ramakant (PW/2),\nTara Devi (P.W.3), Lalita (P.W.4), Savita (P.W.5), Chotku (PW/6) and Vinod\n(P.W.6) would also have deposed this fact in their statement. So on that point\nstatement of Kamal Prasad (PW/1) can not be believed. In the considered\nopinion of this court learned trial court committed mistake in holding\nappellants guilty for assaulting Lalita (PW/4) and Rajendra.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"112937928\" id=\"span_25\">39.
