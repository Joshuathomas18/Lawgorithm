In the three question formulated,\n\nthe    High    Court   took    the   view    that   the     Magistrate     had\n\nconducted a proper inquiry under <a href=\"/doc/1149595/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 202</a> of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure before proceeding against the appellants.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">        The moot question before us revolves around Question\n\nNo. 1 which was formulated by the High Court and it is to be\n\nseen    as     to    whether    dispute     between       the    parties    is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                                 6</span>\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 702 OF 2017\n\nessentially    of    a     civil    nature      or   any   case    is    made      out\n\nagainst the appellants for launching criminal prosecution\n\nunder the aforesaid Sections.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">      After going through the allegations contained in the\n\ncomplaint    and    the     material       on    record,     we    are    of       firm\n\nconclusion    that       the     matter     entirely       pertains      to     civil\n\njurisdiction and not even a prima facie case is made out for\n\noffences under <a href=\"/doc/1596332/\" id=\"a_12\">Sections 420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/857232/\" id=\"a_13\">406</a>, <a href=\"/doc/572470/\" id=\"a_14\">409</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 120B</a>\n\nof IPC even if the allegations contained in the complaint\n\nare to be taken on their face value.                   The complaint gives a\n\nclear impression that it was primarily a case where the\n\nrespondent had alleged breach of contract on the part of the\n\nappellants    in     not       making     the   entire      payments      for      the\n\nservices rendered to the appellants.                  On the other hand, it\n\nis not in dispute that substantial amounts have been paid by\n\nthe appellants to the respondent-company for the services\n\nrendered.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">      Reason for non-payment of the balance amount as given\n\nby   the   appellants      is    that     the   services     rendered         by   the\n\nrespondent-company         were     not    in     terms    of     the    agreement\n\nentered    into    between       the    parties      and   were    deficient        in\n\nnature.      For this reason, even the appellants have filed\n\nclaims     against       the       respondent-company           alleging           that\n\nappellant suffered losses because of the defective services\n\nprovided by the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">      On the basis of it, we find that it cannot be said that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                                          7</span>\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 702 OF 2017\n\nat the time of entering into the agreement, either the first\n\nagreement    or    even   the     second     agreement,     there    was    any\n\nintention    on    the    part    of   the   appellants     to   cheat      the\n\nrespondent.       No suspicion of any nature was shown or even\n\nalleged.     It is also not the allegation of the respondent in\n\nthe   complaint    that    the    agreement     was   entered       into   with\n\nfraudulent    or    dishonest      intention     on   the    part     of   the\n\nappellants in inducing the respondent to enter into such a\n\ncontract.
