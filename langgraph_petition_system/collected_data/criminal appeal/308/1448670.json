It was also \nprovided that OM would come into force with effect \nfrom the date of Notification of amendment to the \nrelevant rules and regulations. To a similar effect \nDepartment of Public Enterprises, Ministry of \nIndustry, Government of India issued another OM \nNo. 18(6)/98-GM-GL-002 dated 19th May, 1998 \nmaking it clear that such increase in age of \nretirement would come into force from the date the \nrelevant rules and regulations of the PSEs concerned \nare amended by the concerned Public Sector \nEnterprises. As per this OM the Board of Directors of \nthe Fertilizer Corporation of India Ltd  (FCIL) \nconsidered the matter and passed a resolution on \n6th July 1998. Relevant portion of which reads:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">&quot;\u0005The Board noted that FCIL was \nreferred to BFIR in April 1992 and \ndeclared sick in November 1992. No \nrevival package has been approved \nby BFIR so far. Gorakpur Unit is \nclosed since June 1990 carrying \nsurplus of 1322 men as on 1-7-1998 \nand Korba, which was wound up, is \ncarrying surplus of 54 men. Besides, \nFCIL is carrying surpluses in the \nCorporation all over for which a \nvoluntary retirement scheme \nproviding special financial incentive \nto induce employees to seek early \nretirement is in operation since 1998 \nand so far 1524 persons have availed \nthe benefit under the scheme as on \n30-6-1998. FCIL is totally dependent \non Govt. support for critical capital \nexpenditure, working capital and to \nmeet the huge operating losses by \nits units. Wages of the employees \nhave not been revised; as a result \nthere has been a flight of talent. The \nonly little incentive was promotion \nwhich will also be blocked in case \nage of retirement is enhanced from \n58 years to 60. Enhancing the age of \nretirement involves financial \nimplications, which will further \njeopardize the revival proposal of the \nCorporation before the BIFR. \nIn view of the above the Board \nunanimously decided not to raise the \nage of retirement from 58 to 60 \nyears\u0005&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">This decision was communicated to the concerned \nMinistry on 21st August 1998 and the Department of \nFertilizers, Ministry of Chemicals and Fertilizers, \nGovernment of India granted exemption vide its \nletter dated 30th December 1999 from increasing the \nage of retirement from 58 to 60 years.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">In the meanwhile the appellants herein  \nsuperannuated on their attaining the age of 58 \nyears as per the terms of the service contract. \nAppellants herein moved the High Court for a \ndirection to the Respondents herein not to retire \nthem from services before they attained the age of \nsixty years and till such time not to interfere with \nthe functioning and discharge of their duties. The \nHigh Court dismissed the petition and hence this \nappeal by special leave. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">It is urged on behalf of appellants that the OM \ndated 13th May 1998 by itself increased the \nretirement age and the policy set out therein is  \nmandatory and binding on FCIL to enhance the \nretirement age.  This OM is applicable only to \nemployees in Government Civil Services and not to \nemployees in the Public Sector Enterprises.  Hence \nby reason of this OM, the appellants cannot contend \nthat they are entitled to continue in service till they \nattain the age of 60 years.  It is only by OM issued \nby the Department of Public Enterprises dated 19th \nMay 1998 the said policy was made applicable to be \neffective from the date of modification of relevant \nRules regarding the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">By OMs dated 25th January 1991 and 08th April \n1991, the Ministry of Program Implementation and \nDepartment of Public Enterprises  made  it clear that \nall instructions/guidelines issued by the Government \nof India  would be of two kinds \u0016 a)  Directives \nissued in the name of President of India and b). \nGuidelines.  Directives would be issued by the \nAdministrative Ministry in the name of the President \nwhile all other instructions issued by the \nDepartment of Public Enterprise or by the \nAdministrative Ministry are only advisory which the \nBoard of Directors of the concerned Public Sector \nUndertakings may in their discretion adopt or not for \nreasons to be recorded in writing. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">Here the Government of India took a policy \ndecision to increase the retirement of Central \nGovernment employees. Application of that decision \nin respect of employees of Public Sector Enterprises \nis dependent upon so many factors that are to be \ntaken into account in the light of the peculiar \ncharacteristics of each company or corporation or \ndepartment. So the first OM itself provides that the \norder will come into force only with effect from the \ndate of Notification of amendment to the relevant \nrules and regulations. So it is for the concerned \nauthority to make necessary changes in the rules \nand regulations after taking into account of all the \nrelevant aspects. Immediately after the first OM \ndated 13 May 1998 the Department of Public \nEnterprises, Ministry of Industry, Government of \nIndia issued OM dated 19th May 1998 wherein the \nmodalities of the implementation of first OM in this \ndepartment was detailed. Here it is pertinent to note \nthat the OM dated 19th May 1998 is not an \ninstruction issued in the name of the President. On \nthe other hand, it was issued by the Department of \nPublic Enterprise, which is advisory in nature. It \naccorded a broad discretion to the corporations or \ncompanies for the implementation of the enhanced \nretirement age after taking into account  all the \nrelevant factors. Pursuant to this direction the Board \nof Directors of FCIL took the decision not to increase \nthe retirement age of its employees. The relevant \nfactors that prevailed upon the Board of Directors \nare fully sset out in its resolution and they are: that \nthe company is one of the highest loss making \ncompany in the country; that the accumulated loss \ntill the relevant date was to the tune of 5049 crores; \nthat the company is incurring financial losses of \nroughly Rupees 2.35 crores everyday; that the \ncompany has no capacity to pay salaries to its \nemployees; that the company was referred to BIFR \nand was declared as sick in 6/11/1992; that as on \nthe relevant date the company has the negative net \nworth to the tune of Rupees 4316.21 crores and; \nthat the company has surplus manpower;  that it is \nnot taking any new employees  but on the contrary \nit is making conscious efforts to reduce the surplus \nmanpower. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">It is also to be noted that the OM dated 19th \nMay 1998 itself does not raise the retirement age to \nsixty years. It is only an administrative direction and \nCourt cannot issue a writ to enforce such \nadministrative instructions that is not having the \nforce of law.  The Appellants do not have any  right \nto continue in service till the age of sixty years. The \ndecision of the Board of Directors is not arbitrary or \nunreasonable or unrelated to the question of \nenhancement in age of retirement.  Hence the first \ncontention stands rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">The Appellants assail the decision of the Board \non the ground of violation of principles of equality.  \nIt is alleged that the Board level employees were \nallowed to continue in service till the age of sixty \nand the employees like appellants who were below \nthe Board level were forced to retire at the age of \nfifty-eight. In reply respondents submitted that \nboard level employees could not be equated and \ncompared with the other employees.  Whole time \ndirectors, who are two in numbers, are directly \nappointed by the President of India for a fixed term \nof five years that could be reviewed even earlier; \nand that other members of the board are \ngovernment servants and are nominees or \nrepresentatives from various ministries and are \nappointed by the President of India for a term of \nthree years. In these circumstances we find that \nboard of directors themselves form a different class \nand cannot be compared with other employees in \nregard to conditions of service applicable to them.  \nAllegation of discrimination is also raised by the \nAppellants vis-`-vis employees of other \ncorporations. Each Public Sector Undertaking is an \nindependent body/entity and is free to have its own \nservice conditions as per law.  However, all \nemployees in the FCIL who are working in its \nvarious Units and Divisions retire at the age of fifty-\neight as per the relevant rules; and that even the \nfuture employees will retire at the age of fifty-eight. \nWe also find that since the employees of different \ncorporations could not be treated alike since every \ncorporation will have to take into account its \nseparate circumstances so as to formulate its policy \nand consequently the argument that there is \ndiscrimination of Appellants vis-`-vis employees of \nother corporation also cannot be accepted. Thus, \nappellants have failed on all  grounds.  The Appeals \nstand dismissed. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">A writ petition was also filed with the prayer to \nissue appropriate writ or order or direction \u0016 (a) to \nimplement OM dated 19/05/1998 and 21/08/1998 \nand (b) for quashing the order dated 30/12/1999 of \nthe department of Fertilizers on identical grounds \nconsidered by us in the appeals. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_10\">For the very reasons stated therein this petition \nalso stands dismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">Appeal (civil)#Appeal (civil)  4051 of 1996#1996#M/s Pepsi Foods Limited\t\t\t\t\n#Collector of Central Excise, Chandigarh  \n#2003-11-25#25622#4051#P.
