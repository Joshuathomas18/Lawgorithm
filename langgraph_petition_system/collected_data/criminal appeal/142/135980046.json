On   17.5.2000,\n\ncomplainant made his statement before Kanwar Vijay Partap\n\nSingh, Station House Officer, Police Station Gharinda that on the\n\nsaid date at about 9.00 A.M., he was present in his house along\n\nwith his son Jaswinder Singh.

The complainant as well as the other injured\n\nwitnesses had suffered injuries in the alleged occurrence. The\n\npresence of the said witnesses at the spot, thus, cannot be\n\ndoubted.          PW-1 Piara Singh, PW-6 Satnam Singh, PW-7\n\nJaswinder Singh and PW-9 Kuldip Singh have duly proved the\n\nprosecution case qua the manner of occurrence. PW-2 Swaran\n\nSingh did not support the prosecution case in his cross\n\nexamination as it was deferred on the request of the learned\n\ndefence counsel. The said witness had duly supported the\n\nprosecution case in his examination in chief and had apparently\n\nbeen won over by the accused after the case was adjourned for\n\nhis cross examination. However, the prosecution case qua the\n\nmanner of occurrence is duly proved by PW-1 Piara Singh, PW-6\n Crl.

The eye\n\nwitnesses have deposed that Sukhchain Singh had fired from his\n\ndouble barrel gun on the person of Amarjit Singh. As per the\n\nmedical opinion, Amarjit Singh had died due to fire arm injuries\n\nsuffered by him. So far as the other injured are concerned, the\n\nmedical opinion corroborates the ocular version that they had\n\nsuffered fire arm injures on account of shot fired by Jagir Singh.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">               It is also the case of prosecution that Harjit Singh had\n\nalso suffered fire arm injuries in the occurrence which had taken\n\nplace on 17.5.2000. However, the said injured had died on\n\n16.7.2001. From the evidence on record, it is apparent that\n\nHarjit Singh injured had remained in comma till his death on\n\naccount of injuries suffered by him. On various occasions,\n\nopinion was sought by the investigating agency from the doctors\n\nand injured Harjit Singh was declared unfit to make a statement.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">Although the initial medico legal report qua injured Harjit Singh\n\nhas not been proved on record but PW-3 Dr. Gurmanjit Rai has\n\ngiven his opinion after going through the medical record of the\n\ndeceased Harjit Singh. Moreover, PW-11 Dr. Ajay Gupta deposed\n\nthat Harjit Singh was admitted in their hospital on 17.5.2000\n\nand the said patient was declared unfit to make a statement.\n\nThe other doctors, who had given treatment to injured Harjit\n\nSingh, have also deposed that the patient was declared unfit to\n\nmake a statement by them.                   Thus, from the ocular as well as\n\nmedical evidence on record it is evident that Harjit Singh had\n\ndied due to the fire arm injuries suffered by him at the hands of\n\nSukhwinder Singh.

The complainant party cannot be made to\n\nsuffer on account of lapse committed by the investigating agency.\n\nThe ocular version and the medical evidence are trustworthy and\n\nprosecution case is duly established from the said evidence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">               Admittedly, there was civil litigation between the\n\nparties.      All the accused had come to the spot armed with\n\nweapons with a view to take forcible possession of the land in\n\nquestion. The trial court rightly came to the conclusion that the\n\naccused had not come to the spot with a common object to cause\n\ninjuries to Piara Singh and others.                     Rather, they had merely\n\ncome to the spot to compel Piara Singh to leave possession of the\n\nland. It is on the spur of the moment that accused Sukhchain\n\nSingh fired from his gun at Amarjit Singh who died at the spot.\n\nAccused Sukhwinder Singh fired from his gun at Harjit Singh\n\nwho succumbed to his injuries after one year and two months of\n\nthe occurrence. Accused Jagir Singh fired at Kuldip Singh and\n\nthe pallets hit Kuldip Singh, Satnam Singh, Swaran Singh,\n\nJaswinder Singh, Palwinder Singh and Jagtar Singh. Hence, the\n\ntrial court rightly held that all the accused were guilty of an\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1196530/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 144</a> IPC and accused Sukhwinder Singh\n\nwas guilty of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 302</a> IPC and accused Jagir\n\nSingh was guilty of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 307</a> IPC. The trial\n\ncourt further rightly come to the conclusion that accused\n\nSukhwinder Singh and Jagir Singh were also guilty of an offence\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 27</a> of the Arms Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_74\"> Crl.

This\n\nargument raised by the learned counsel for the appellant has\n\nfailed to find favour with us. Appellant Sukhwinder Singh had\n\nfired from his gun at Harjit Singh. The said fact is sufficient to\n\ninfer that he had the intention to commit murder of the\n\ndeceased. Merely because the deceased had died after one year\n\nand two months of the occurrence, would not lead to the\n\ninference that appellant Sukhwinder Singh had no intention to\n\ncommit the murder of deceased Harjit Singh.                           Deceased Harjit\n\nSingh had remained in comma till his death on account of fire\n\narm injuries suffered by him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">               Accordingly, all the three appeals are dismissed.\n\n\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">       (JASBIR SINGH)                                              (SABINA)\n         JUDGE                                                      JUDGE\n\n\nOctober 31, 2011\nGurpreet\n </pre>","numcites":15,"numcitedby":108,"docsource":"Punjab-Haryana High Court","citetid":135980046,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"section 302 ipc","formInput":"section%20302%20ipc"},{"value":"sec 307 of indian penal code","formInput":"sec%20307%20of%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"section 302 indian penal code","formInput":"section%20302%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"sec 144 ","formInput":"sec%20144%20"},{"value":"medical evidence","formInput":"medical%20evidence"},{"value":"307 ipc","formInput":"307%20ipc"},{"value":"comma","formInput":"comma"},{"value":"sec.307 ipc","formInput":"sec.307%20ipc"},{"value":"offence under section 307","formInput":"offence%20under%20section%20307"},{"value":"section 307","formInput":"section%20307"},{"value":"section 144 ipc","formInput":"section%20144%20ipc"},{"value":"swaran singh","formInput":"swaran%20singh"},{"value":" who can do post mortem examination   ","formInput":"%20who%20can%20do%20post%20mortem%20examination%20%20%20"},{"value":"jagir","formInput":"jagir"},{"value":"indian penal code 307","formInput":"indian%20penal%20code%20307"},{"value":"disclosure statement","formInput":"disclosure%20statement"},{"value":"Piara Singh","formInput":"Piara%20Singh"},{"value":"medico legal","formInput":"medico%20legal"},{"value":"depression","formInput":"depression"},{"value":"simple injury ","formInput":"simple%20injury%20"}],"cats":[{"value":"murder","formInput":"tag:murder"},{"value":"attempt-to-murder","formInput":"tag:attempt-to-murder"},{"value":"unlawful-assembly","formInput":"tag:unlawful-assembly"},{"value":"punishment-for-using-arms","formInput":"tag:punishment-for-using-arms"},{"value":"rioting","formInput":"tag:rioting"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
