Since all these appeals arise out of common \njudgments and orders dated 25.01.2007 and 19.02.2007 \npassed by a learned Single Judge of the High Court of Punjab \nand Haryana in Criminal Appeal No. 1410-SBA of 2002, \nCriminal Appeal No. 1411-SBA of 2002, Criminal Appeal No. \n1412-SBA of 2002, Criminal Appeal No. 1413-SBA of 2002, \nCriminal Appeal No. 1433-SBA of 2002, Criminal Misc. \nPetition No.29090-M of 2001 and Criminal Misc. Petition \nNo.36987-M of 2001.  As similar questions of facts and law are \ninvolved, therefore, for the sake of convenience they are being \nheard together and disposed of by this common judgment.\nBrief facts, which led to the trial of the appellant, are as \nfollows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">Jagdish Chand - respondent herein and his wife Smt. \nRamesh Rani are the proprietors of M/s Mehra Export \nCorporation and M/s Mehra International, Katra Hari Singh, \nAmritsar.  The firms deal in saffron, herbs and other like \ngoods.  M/s Sudhir Kumar Bhalla and Brothers, 25, Green \nPark, Ludhiana, of which Sudhir Kumar Bhalla - appellant \nherein is one of the partners, has been purchasing various \ngoods from the firms of Jagdish Chand and Ramesh Rani.  The \nsale price was being paid in cash and at times, through \ncheques.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">In the month of May, 1997, the appellant on behalf of his \nfirm issued six cheques Nos. 442344, 442345, 442346, \n442347, 442348 and 442349 dated 01.05.1997, 03.05.1997 \nand 05.05.1997 in favour of M/s Mehra Export Corporation \nand M/s Mehra International.  Out of those six cheques, two \ncheques were in the sums of Rs.30,000/- each and four \ncheques were in the sums of Rs.40,000/- each.  All those \ncheques were drawn in favour of the Indian Overseas Bank, \nLudhiana.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">One of the cheques, in the sum of Rs.30,000/-, was \nstated to have been encashed, whereas the other five cheques \nhave been dishonoured on the ground of &#x27;Exceed \nArrangement&#x27;.  On 20.05.1997, the respondent sent statutory \nnotices under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 138 (5)</a> of the Negotiable Instruments \nAct, 1881 [for short &#x27;the Act&#x27;] to the appellant, which were \ndespatched through registered post on 24.05.1997.  However, \nthe same were received back on 28/29.5.1997 with a report \nthat the addressee was &#x27;not met&#x27;.  The respondent again sent \nanother notice on 04.06.1997 through courier, which again \nwas not accepted by the appellant and the same was received \nback on 05.06.1997 with the report of refusal.  \nIt was on 13.06.1997 that the respondent, on his behalf \nand on behalf of his wife as her attorney, filed five criminal \ncomplaints under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 138</a> of the Act read with <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 420</a> \nof the Indian Penal Code [for short &#x27;the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_4\">IPC</a>&#x27;] in the Court of \nChief Judicial Magistrate, Amritsar, against the appellant.  On \n09.07.1997, the respondent-complainant made a statement \nthat he wanted to withdraw the said complaint with \npermission to file the fresh complaint.  The learned Chief \nJudicial Magistrate vide his order dated 09.07.1997 passed \nthe following order:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">&quot;In view of the statement given by the \ncomplainant, recorded separately, the \npresent complaint is hereby dismissed as \nwithdrawn.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">On 12.07.1997, the respondent filed second complaint on \nsimilar and practically the same points purported to have \naccrued on identical causes of action.  The second complaint \nwas entrusted to the Court of Judicial Magistrate, 1st Class, \nAmritsar, who recorded the statement/evidence of the \nrespondent on 12.07.1997.  Thereafter, the Judicial \nMagistrate, 1st Class, vide order dated 23.08.1997 issued \nsummon to the appellant.  The appellant appeared on \n06.04.1998 before the Judicial Magistrate and filed an \napplication for discharging him in the case.  However, on \n01.06.1998 the Judicial Magistrate dismissed the said \napplication.  After following and adopting the due procedure as \nprescribed under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_5\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973 (for \nshort &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_6\">Cr.P.C</a>.&#x27;), the trial court dismissed the complaint on \n06.02.2002 and acquitted the appellant.      \nBeing aggrieved by the order of acquittal of the appellant \nby the trial court, the respondent filed five criminal appeals, \ntwo as an attorney of his wife and three on his behalf, in the \nHigh Court.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">In April 1998, the appellant approached the Court of \nJudicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Ludhiana, under <a href=\"/doc/1291024/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 156</a> of \nCr.P.C. by way of two separate applications alleging fraud, \ncheating, tampering of the cheques by the respondent and his \nwife and prayed that the police be directed to register criminal \ncases against them.  On the directions of the learned \nMagistrate, FIR No.93 of 1998 was registered against the \nrespondent under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections 420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1328629/\" id=\"a_9\">463</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1317063/\" id=\"a_10\">465</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_11\">468</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_12\">471</a> of the \nIPC, whereas second FIR No.94 of 1998 was lodged against \nJagdish Chand and Smt. Ramesh Rani under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_13\">Sections 420</a>, \n<a href=\"/doc/1328629/\" id=\"a_14\">463</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1317063/\" id=\"a_15\">465</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_16\">468</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_17\">471</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_18\">120-B</a> of the IPC at Police Station, \nSarabha Nagar, Ludhiana.  After investigation, the police filed \nchallans in both the cases in the court.  The trial court charge \nsheeted the respondent and his wife vide two separate orders \ndated 15.01.2000.  They filed two revision petitions against the \norders of framing charges against them, which were dismissed \nby the learned Sessions Judge, Ludhiana, vide separate orders \ndated 04.06.2001.  The respondent and his wife filed two \nCriminal Miscellaneous Petitions Nos. 29090 and 36987-M of \n2001 in the High Court challenging the validity and \ncorrectness of the orders of the learned Trial Magistrate as \nalso of the learned Sessions Judge.     \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">The High Court vide its judgment dated 25.01.2007 \nallowed the above-said five appeals and convicted the \nappellant under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 138</a> of the Act.  By the same order, \nCriminal Misc. Petitions Nos. 29090 and 36987-M of 2001 \nwere allowed and FIR Nos. 93 and 94 of 1998 lodged by the \nrespondent and his wife were quashed.  By order dated \n19.02.2007, the appellant was sentenced to undergo R.I. for \none year and to pay a fine of Rs.8 lacs and in default thereof,  \nthe appellant shall undergo further R.I. of one year.  Hence, \nthe appellant has preferred these appeals.\nWe have heard the learned counsel for the parties and \nwith their assistance, examined the entire material placed on \nrecord.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">Mr. P.S. Patwalia, learned senior counsel appearing on \nbehalf of the appellant, assailed the judgment of the High \nCourt inter alia contending:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(i)\tthat the learned Single Judge erred in not \nappreciating the statement of the respondent-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">complainant in which he admitted that all the \ncheques were filled by him, the date and \nfigures of the amounts were also in his \nhandwriting and the appellant simply had \nsigned the cheques.  According to the learned \ncounsel, the cheques in question have been \nforged and fabricated by the respondent by \nmaking material alteration by changing figure \nin digit from Rs.30,000/- to Rs.3,00,000/- by \nadding  &#x27;zero&#x27; at the end of Rs.30,000/- and \nRs.40,000/- to Rs.4,00,000/- by adding &#x27;zero&#x27; \nat the end of Rs.40,000/-; and\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">(ii)\tthat the learned Single Judge erred in not \naddressing the legal arguments raised on \nbehalf of the appellant that the provisions of \n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 138</a> of the Act are only attracted if the \ncheques issued in discharge of liability or debt \nare dishonoured, but not on account of \nsecurity cheques.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">Mr. Ankit Singhal, learned counsel for the respondent, on \nthe other hand, contended that the reasons given by the High \nCourt recording the order of conviction of the appellant are \nbased upon proper appreciation of evidence led by the \nrespondent in the case.  He submitted that this Court should \nbe slow to interfere in the well-reasoned and well-merited \njudgment of the High Court.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">We have given our anxious consideration to the rival \ncontentions of the learned counsel for the parties.  The \narguments put forward by Mr. Patwalia deserve to be \naccepted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">We have gone through the record of the trial Magistrate \nplaced before us.  In support of the complaint filed under \n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 138</a> of the Act, the trial Magistrate examined the \nrespondent on 27.04.1999.  On 05.05.2000, the respondent in \nhis cross-examination admitted as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;I have brought the account books for the \nyear 1995-96 and 1996-97.  I have seen \nthe ledger for the year 1995-96 where \nthere is a payment of rupees one lac \ndated 26.10.1995 having been made by \nthe accused to me but the remaining \namounts are for an amount of \nRs.35,000/- each and at one time it was \nfor an amount of Rs.40,000/-.   Once a \npayment of Rs.25,000/- was also made in \nthe said year.  This ledger relates to the \nfirm M/s Mehra Exports.  The payments \nof Rs.35,000/- each have  been made \neither through cheques or through drafts.  \nI have also seen the ledger book of M/s \nMehra International for the year 1995-96.  \nExcept Rs.10,000/- all the payments \nmade in this account are either through \ndraft or through cheque.  The lowest \npayment in this account in this year is \nRs.10,000/- the maximum payment \nmade by the accused to this firm in this \naccount is Rs.50,000/-.  The notices were \nsent only to the firm M/s Sudhir Kumar \nBhalla and Brothers before filing the \ncomplaint and not to the partners \nindividually.  We did not receive any \ncheque from the accused bearing \nNo.442344. We never received any \nadvance payment from the accused.  As \nper account books of firm M/s Mehra \nInternational for the year 1997-98 a sum \nof Rs.7,16,672.50 ps.  On account of \nprincipal amount is due from the \naccused.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">The respondent again stated as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;The cheque No.442347 is in my hands \nwhich is dated 5.5.1997 but the same is \nsigned by accused Sudhir Kumar Bhalla.  \nAll the cheques which are subject-matter \nof other complaints are filled in by me \nand are signed by Sudhir Kumar Bhalla \naccused.  The dates on the cheques are \nalso in my hands.  The amount of the \ncheques in words and figures are also in \nmy hands.  I can read the contents of the \ncheques clearly.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">On 05.05.2000, the trial court on the basis of the \nstatement of the respondent-complainant in his cross-\nexamination made the following observations:-   \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;At this stage, counsel for accused had \nmade a request for giving note regarding \nthe demoneur of the witness as well as to \ngive note on the aforesaid fact so that the \ndocument may not be tampered with \nsubsequent. Heard, without commenting \nupon the demoneur of the witness at this \nstage.  I have observed from cheque No. \n442349 dated 3.5.1997 the last zero of \nthe figure written in the column of rupees \nis separate from the remaining four zeros \nwhich are attached with each other in the \nsame flow.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">Thereafter, on 21.05.2001 the cheques were sent to Mr. \nSardara Singh Parmar, Document Expert, for examination, \nwho in his report dated 21.05.2001 submitted to the Court, \nopined as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">&quot;In view of the reasons stated above, I am \nof the opinion that the last figure (0) in \nabove mentioned cheque has not been \nwritten in the continuous process by the \nsame person with the same pen and ink, \nbut it has been subsequently changed \ninto by adding figure (0) in the original \namount Rs. 40,000/- and it is free hand \nforgery.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">Mr. Sardara Singh Parmar was examined as DW-3 before \nthe trial court on 13.08.2001 and deposed as under:-    \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">&quot;I am of the opinion that the last figure \nzero in above mentioned cheque has not \nbeen written in the continuous process \nby the same person with the same pen \nand ink, but it has been subsequently \nchanged into by adding figure zero in the \noriginal amount Rs. 30,000/- and it is \nfree hand forgery.  The reasons have \nalready been given in my report dated \n21.5.2001.  It consists of 6 pages and it is \nEx.DW3/1.  It has been prepared by me \nsigned by me and is correct.  One \nphotograph chart bearing the photograph \ncheque No. 442345 dt. 5.5.97 is \nEx.DW3/2, one negative is Ex.DW/3.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">As noticed above, the Judicial Magistrate vide his \njudgment dated 06.02.2002 acquitted the appellant of the \ncharge under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 138</a> of the Act and consequently \ndismissed the complaint of the respondent.\nThe learned Single Judge of the High Court, after hearing \nthe learned counsel for the parties, recorded the conviction of \nthe appellant vide order dated 25.01.2007 for an offence under \n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 138</a> of the Act, which reads as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">&quot;Lastly, it was contended by the learned \ncounsel for Sudhir Kumar Bhalla that the \nfigures of Rs.30,000/- and Rs.40,000/- \nmentioned in the cheques were \ninterpolated by adding &#x27;zero&#x27; to make the \nsame Rs.3,00,000/- and Rs.4,00,000/-.  \nHe contended that there is evidence of \nthe handwriting expert to establish the \nafore-stated fact and the trial court had \nrightly dis-believed the claim of Jagdish \nChand on this court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">The contention of the learned counsel for \nSudhir Kumar Bhalla is misplaced.  The \ntrial court had clearly fallen in error by \nignoring the fact that the cheques were \nnot only filled in figures, but in words as \nwell, according to which Rs.3 lacs and \nRs.4 lacs were written thereon.  Even \nthough, the handwriting expert opined \nthat the zero has been added in the \ncheques subsequently, but it was clearly \nin consonance with the wishes of Sudhir \nKumar Bhalla, who had issued the \ncheques by depicting the amounts in \nwords also.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">That apart, there is cogent evidence on \nrecord in the shape of original bills and \nthe complete details of the prices of the \ngoods supplied and the registers of \naccount, which could not be countered by \nSudhir Kumar Bhalla during the course \nof evidence.  In view of the overwhelming \nevidence in favour of Jagdish Chand, the \nfindings of the trial court awarding an \nacquittal to Sudhir Kumar Bhalla are \nunsustainable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">On the basis of the above discussion, it is \nheld that Sudhir Kumar Bhalla, who was \none of the partners of M/s Sudhir Kumar \nBhalla &amp; Brothers, Ludhiana, issued the \ncheques in question to discharge the \nliability of his firm and on presentation \nthereof by Jagdish Chand and Ramesh \nRani, the same were dishonoured.  Thus, \nhe had committed an offence punishable \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 138</a> of the Act.  This court \nholds him accordingly guilty for the same \nin each of the appeals.  \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">For the reason that the findings qua \ninterpolation in the cheques in question \nhave been categorically set aside, the \nproceedings against Jagdish Chand and \nRamesh Rani initiated in the court of \nJudicial Magistrate, 1st Class, Ludhiana, \npursuant to FIR Nos. 93 and 94 of 1998 \nregistered at Police Station Sarabha \nNagar, Ludhiana, which have been \nassailed in Criminal Miscellaneous \nPetitions Nos. 29090-M and 36987-M of \n2001, must, as a logical consequence, \nfail. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">In view of the above, the criminal appeals \nand the criminal miscellaneous petitions \nfiled by Jagdish Chand and Ramesh Rani \nare accepted.  The proceedings taken \nagainst Jagdish Chand and Ramesh Rani \nin pursuance to FIR Nos. 93 and 94 of \n1998 registered at Police Station Sarabha \nNagar, Ludhiana, are also quashed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">On examination of the above-stated findings of the \nlearned Single Judge in the judgment impugned before us, we \nfind that the learned Single Judge has not addressed himself \non the legal question raised before him by the appellant that \nthe criminal liability of the appellant under the provisions of \n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 138</a> of the Act are attracted only on account of the \ndishonour of the cheques issued in discharge of liability or \ndebt, but not on account of issuance of security cheques.  The \nlearned Single Judge has also not given cogent, satisfactory \nand convincing reasons for disbelieving and discarding the \npre-charge evidence of the appellant corroborated by the \nevidence of the expert opinion in regard to the interpolation in \nand fabrication of the cheques by adding one more figure &#x27;0&#x27; to \nmake Rs.30,000/- to Rs.3,00,000/- and similarly adding one \nmore figure &#x27;0&#x27; to make Rs.40,000/- to Rs.4,00,000/-.\nIn the backdrop of the facts of these cases, we are of the \nopinion that the judgments and orders of the High Court \ncannot be sustained on the premise that the High Court has \nnot addressed itself on the above-said two legal questions \nraised by the appellant and, therefore, the impugned \njudgments and orders dated 25.01.2007 and 19.02.2007 are \nset aside.  The interest of justice should be sub-served if the \nmatters are remitted to the High Court to decide the appeals \nfiled by the respondent against the appellant and criminal \nmiscellaneous petitions seeking for quashing the first \ninformation reports registered against the respondent and his \nwife by the police for commission of the offences stated in FIR \nNos.93 and 94 of 1998.  Needless to say that any observation \nmade by us in this judgment shall not be construed as an \nexpression of opinion on the merits of the cases, which shall \nbe decided by the High Court on their own merits in \naccordance with law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">The appeals shall stand disposed of in the aforesaid \nterms. \n</p>","numcites":10,"numcitedby":93,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":1880223,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"sudhir kumar bhalla","formInput":"sudhir%20kumar%20bhalla"},{"value":"section 420","formInput":"section%20420"},{"value":"criminal petition","formInput":"criminal%20petition"},{"value":"payment  filter:  sale of goods section 420 ipc","formInput":"payment%20%20filter%3A%20%20sale%20of%20goods%20section%20420%20ipc"},{"value":"Ramesh chand ","formInput":"Ramesh%20chand%20"},{"value":"\"section 420\"","formInput":"%22section%20420%22"},{"value":"handwriting","formInput":"handwriting"}],"cats":[{"value":"cheque-dishonour","formInput":"tag:cheque-dishonour"},{"value":"forgery","formInput":"tag:forgery"},{"value":"theft","formInput":"tag:theft"},{"value":"criminal-procedure-code","formInput":"tag:criminal-procedure-code"},{"value":"forged-document","formInput":"tag:forged-document"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
