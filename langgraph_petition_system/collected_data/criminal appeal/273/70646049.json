The\n\ndeceased was 18 years old when she got married to the respondent No.\n\n1 [A1] in a social marriage organisation function 2 conducted on 7th May,\n\n1998. Before her marriage, Geeta Bai along with her mother, Kamla Bai\n\nand her brother used to reside with her maternal uncle, Bansi Lal [PW-\n\n1]. In less than four years of her marriage, Geeta Bai committed suicide\n\nat her matrimonial home by pouring kerosene oil and setting herself on\n\nfire. She was admitted in a burnt condition in the Community Health\n\nCentre, Baroda on 20th April, 2002 and breathed her last on the same\n\nday.        At that time, she was five months pregnant.            On receiving\n\ninformation from the attending doctor, an FIR was lodged on 23 rd April,\n\n2002 [Exhibit P-13].              On completion of the investigation, the charge-\n\nsheet was filed and the case was committed for trial in the Sessions\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">3.        After examining the evidence produced by the prosecution and the\n\ndefence, the trial Court acquitted Sushila [A-3] – mother-in-law             and\n\n\n2 Samuhik VIvaah Sammelan\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                         Page 2 of 20</span>\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 190 OF 2012\n\n\n\n\nJitender [A-4] – brother-in-law of the deceased, but convicted both the\n\nrespondents[A-1 and A-2] [husband and father-in-law of the deceased]\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 304-B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_7\">306</a> and <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_8\">498-A</a> IPC and imposed a sentence of\n\nrigorous imprisonment3 for life for the first offence, RI for a period of\n\nseven years with fine for the second offence and RI for three years with\n\nfine for the third offence. The conviction and sentence imposed on the\n\nrespondents was primarily based on the evidence of Bansi Lal [P.W.-1],\n\nShyam Bihari [P.W.-2] and Amrit Lal [P.W.-4], maternal uncles of the\n\ndeceased who stated that the respondents had been demanding money\n\nfrom the deceased for constructing a house which her family members\n\nwere unable to give. As a result, she was constantly harassed and\n\nsubjected to cruelty, finally leading to her committing suicide.   Dr. V.K.\n\nGarg [P.W.-8], who had conducted the post-mortem examination [Ex. P-\n\n7] on the dead body of the deceased, had deposed that on examining\n\nthe uterus, there was a foetus of five months in a dead condition and, in\n\nhis opinion, the death of Geeta Bai had taken place due to burning.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"756812\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"63843\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1250057\" id=\"span_11\">4.        On the respondents preferring an appeal against the judgment of\n\nconviction dated 17th December, 2003 passed by the Sessions Court, the\n\nHigh Court gave a clean chit to the respondent No. 2 [A-2], while setting\n\naside the order of conviction in respect of the respondent No.1 [A-1]\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 304B</a> and <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_10\">306</a> IPC.             However, the conviction of the\n3 For short ‘RI’\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                  Page 3 of 20</span>\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 190 OF 2012\n\n\n\n\nrespondent No.1 was sustained under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 498-A</a> IPC, but the\n\nsentence of RI for three years imposed on him was reduced to the period\n\nalready undergone by him. For arriving at such a conclusion, the High\n\nCourt was persuaded by the rulings in <a href=\"/doc/1250057/\" id=\"a_12\">K. Prema S. Rao and Another v.\n\nYadla Srinivasa Rao and Others4</a>, <a href=\"/doc/63843/\" id=\"a_13\">Saro Rana and Others v. State of\n\nJharkhand5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/756812/\" id=\"a_14\">Appasaheb and Another v. State of Maharashtra</a> 6\n\nand held that the demand of money for construction of a house cannot\n\nbe treated as a demand for dowry. The High Court agreed with the\n\nsubmission made by the learned counsel for A-1 and A-2, respondents\n\nherein that the offence under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 304-B</a> was not established against\n\nthem as the demand allegedly made on the deceased was for money to\n\nconstruct a house, which cannot be treated as a dowry demand for\n\nconnecting her death to the said cause. The respondents were also\n\nacquitted for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 306</a> IPC as the High Court was of\n\nthe opinion that, from a scrutiny of the depositions of P.W.-1, P.W.-2,\n\nP.W.-4 and P.W.-6, there was nothing to sustain the conclusion that the\n\nrespondents had abetted the deceased to commit suicide. As for the\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 498-A</a> relating to cruelty meted out to the\n\ndeceased, the High Court acquitted the respondent No. 2, while\n\nmaintaining the conviction order in respect of the respondent No. 1.\n\n\n4   (2003) 1 SCC 217\n5   2005 Crl.L.J. 65 delivered by a Division Bench of the High Court of Jharkhand\n6   (2007) 9 SCC 721\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                        Page 4 of 20</span>\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 190 OF 2012\n\n\n\n\nAggrieved by <a href=\"/doc/756812/\" id=\"a_18\">the said judgment</a>, the present appeal has been filed by the\n\nState of Madhya Pradesh.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">5.        Mr. Prashant Singh, learned Advocate General for the appellant-\n\nState has assailed the impugned judgment and contended that the High\n\nCourt has failed to appreciate the harassment caused to the deceased\n\nat the hands of the respondents who had been constantly demanding\n\nmoney from her to construct a house and purchase a plot of land; that\n\nthe High Court did not consider the testimonies of Bansi Lal [P.W.-1],\n\nShyam Bihari [P.W.-2], Amrit Lal [P.W.-4] and Rajesh Bhai [P.W.-6], who\n\nhad unanimously stated that whenever the deceased used to visit her\n\nparental home, she would complain that she was being subjected to\n\nassault by the respondents for bringing a sum of ₹50,000/- [Rupees Fifty\n\nthousand] for constructing a house and that it was due to this\n\nharassment caused by them that the deceased got fed up and was\n\nforced to commit suicide. Learned counsel argued that contribution of\n\nmoney to construct a house, as demanded by the respondents from the\n\ndeceased ought to be treated as a dowry demand and it is quite\n\napparently a case where the offence under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 304-B</a> was made\n\nout. It was also submitted that this was a clear-cut case of abetment to\n\ncommit suicide and both the respondents had rightly been convicted for\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                  Page 5 of 20</span>\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 190 OF 2012\n\n\n\n\nthe said offence by the trial Court, which order has been erroneously\n\noverturned in appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">6.

In\n\nAppasaheb’s case [supra] referred to in the impugned judgment, this\n\nCourt had held that a demand for money from the parents of the\n\ndeceased woman to purchase manure would not fall within the purview\n\nof “dowry”, thereby strictly interpreting the definition of dowry.

In the facts of the instant case, we are of the opinion that the trial\n\nCourt has correctly interpreted the demand for money raised by the\n\nrespondents on the deceased for construction of a house as falling within\n\nthe definition of the word “dowry”. The submission made by learned\n\ncounsel for the respondents that the deceased was also a party to such\n\na demand as she had on her own asked her mother and maternal uncle\n\nto contribute to the construction of the house, must be understood in the\n\ncorrect perspective.              It cannot be lost sight of that the respondents had\n\nbeen constantly tormenting the deceased and asking her to approach\n\nher family members for money to build a house and it was only on their\n\npersistence and insistence that she was compelled to ask them to\n\ncontribute some amount for constructing a house. The Court must be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                           Page 13 of 20</span>\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 190 OF 2012\n\n\n\n\nsensitive to the social milieu from which the parties hail. The fact that the\n\nmarriage of the deceased and the respondent No.1 was conducted in a\n\ncommunity marriage organization where some couples would have tied\n\nthe knot goes to show that the parties were financially not so well off.\n\nThis position is also borne out from the deposition of P.W.-1 who had\n\nstated that he used to bear the expenses of the couple. Before the\n\nmarriage of the deceased also, P.W.-1 had stated that he used to bear\n\nher expenses and that of her mother and brother [his sister and nephew]\n\nas her father had abandoned them. In this background, the High Court\n\nfell in an error in drawing an inference that since the deceased had\n\nherself joined her husband and father-in-law, respondents herein and\n\nasked her mother or uncle to contribute money to construct a house,\n\nsuch demand cannot be treated as a “dowry demand”. On the contrary,\n\nthe evidence brought on record shows that the deceased was\n\npressurized to make such a request for money to her mother and uncle.\n\nIt was not a case of complicity but a case of sheer helplessness faced by\n\nthe deceased in such adverse circumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">15.       Now, coming to the second point urged by learned counsel for the\n\nState that the High Court has overlooked the fact that Geeta Bai had\n\nbeen subjected to cruelty/harassment at the hands of the respondents\n\nsoon before her death, which submission is strictly contested by learned\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                  Page 14 of 20</span>\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 190 OF 2012\n\n\n\n\ncounsel for the respondents, we may note that the meaning of the\n\nexpression “soon before her death” has been discussed threadbare in\n\nseveral judgments.                <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10522469\" id=\"span_31\">In <a href=\"/doc/10522469/\" id=\"a_38\">Surinder Singh</a> (supra), while relying on the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 113-B</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 15 and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 304-B</a> IPC, where the words “soon before her death” find\n\nmention, the following pertinent observations have been made: -</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">                    “17. Thus, the words “soon before” appear in <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_41\">Section\n                    113-B</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 and also in <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 304-\n                    B </a>IPC. For the presumptions contemplated under these\n                    sections to spring into action, it is necessary to show\n                    that the cruelty or harassment was caused soon before\n                    the death. The interpretation of the words “soon before”\n                    is, therefore, important. The question is how “soon\n                    before”? This would obviously depend on the facts and\n                    circumstances of each case. The cruelty or harassment\n                    differs from case to case. It relates to the mindset of people\n                    which varies from person to person. Cruelty can be mental or\n                    it can be physical. Mental cruelty is also of different shades.\n                    It can be verbal or emotional like insulting or ridiculing or\n                    humiliating a woman. It can be giving threats of injury to her\n                    or her near and dear ones. It can be depriving her of\n                    economic resources or essential amenities of life. It can be\n                    putting restraints on her movements. It can be not allowing\n                    her to talk to the outside world. The list is illustrative and not\n                    exhaustive. Physical cruelty could be actual beating or\n                    causing pain and harm to the person of a woman. Every\n                    such instance of cruelty and related harassment has a\n                    different impact on the mind of a woman. Some instances\n                    may be so grave as to have a lasting impact on a woman.\n                    Some instances which degrade her dignity may remain\n                    etched in her memory for a long time. Therefore, “soon\n                    before” is a relative term. In matters of emotions we\n                    cannot have fixed formulae.

The reason for such non-categorisation is due to\n                    the fact that death occurring “otherwise than under normal\n                    circumstances” can, in cases, be homicidal or suicidal or\n                    accidental.”\n                                                           [emphasis added]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">18.       In the instant case, it is not in dispute that the marriage between\n\nthe deceased and the respondent No. 1 – accused had taken place on\n\n7th May, 1998 and the deceased was brought in a severely burnt\n\ncondition from her matrimonial home to the Health Care Centre at\n\nBaroda on 20th April, 2002 and she had expired on the very same day. It\n\nis also not in dispute that the death had occurred on account of the\n\ndeceased dowsing kerosene oil and setting herself on fire.                         The\n\nevidence brought on record amply demonstrates that the harassment of\n\nthe deceased for money had commenced within a few months of her\n\nmarriage and had continued thereafter on several occasions. This fact is\n\nborne out from the deposition of PW-1, which shows that on not being\n\nable to fulfil the demand for ₹50,000/- [Rupees Fifty thousand] made by\n\nthe respondent No. 2 [father-in-law], he had thrown out the deceased\n\nand the respondent No.1 from the matrimonial home. They had then\n\nshifted to Kota and resided there.                    Thereafter, respondent No.2 had\n\nbrought the couple back to Baroda and had again started demanding\n\nmoney from the deceased. Then the deceased and the respondent No.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                            Page 18 of 20</span>\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 190 OF 2012\n\n\n\n\n1 moved to Tankarwada.

On being persistently\n\nhounded with the repeated demands for money made on her which her\n\nfamily could not fulfil, the hapless deceased who was well into the\n\nsecond trimester of her pregnancy, immolated herself at her matrimonial\n\nhome.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">19.       The above glairing circumstances when viewed together,      can\n\nhardly mitigate the offence of the respondents or take the case out of the\n\npurview of <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 304-B</a> IPC, when all the four pre-requisites for\n\ninvoking the said provision stand satisfied, namely, that the death of\n\nGeeta Bai took place at her matrimonial home within seven years of her\n\nmarriage; that the said death took place in abnormal circumstances on\n\naccount of burning and that too when she was five months pregnant; that\n\nshe had been subjected to cruelty and harassment by the respondents\n\nsoon before her death and such cruelty/harassment was in connection\n\nwith demand for dowry. Though the High Court found the testimony of\n\nP.W.-1 [maternal uncle of the deceased] to be trustworthy and consistent\n\nand no credible evidence could be produced by the respondents to\n\ndemolish the prosecution version, surprisingly, their conviction under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 304-B</a> IPC has been set aside and furthermore, respondent No.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                  Page 19 of 20</span>\n\fCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 190 OF 2012\n\n\n\n\n2 has been acquitted for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 498-A</a>\n\nIPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">20.

Accordingly, the judgment of conviction and sentence passed by\n\nthe trial Court in respect of both the respondents under Section 304-B\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 498-A</a> IPC, is restored.
