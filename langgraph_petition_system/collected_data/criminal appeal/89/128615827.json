It is submitted that the definition of ‘preparation’\n\nreveals that preparation means “in relation to NDPS” one or more drugs or\n\nsubstance in dosage or solution or mixture.          The ‘mixture’ is defined as\n\nmechanical mixture or two or more substances as distinct from chemical\n\ncombination or a fluid with foreign substance in suspension or foreign element\n\nin a composition. The ‘solution’ is defined as a liquid or semi-liquid preparation\n\nobtained by the combination of a solid with the solvent. The ‘dosage’ means a\n\ndefinite quantity or something regarded as analogous to medicine in use or\n\neffect. A bare look at the definitions, it is apparent that a drug or substance can\n\nbe mixed with one or more substances (mixture) or change its physical state by\n\nmeans of any fluid or solvent (solution) or be divided or apportioned (dosage).\n\nIn other words, the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_24\">NDPS Act</a> as originally enacted dealt not only with the pure\n\ncontent of the drug or psychotropic substance but, its preparation in a mixture,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                         4</span>\n\fsolution or dosage. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813727\" id=\"span_13\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_25\">E Micheal Raj</a> (supra), there is no reference to\n\nthe aforesaid;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">2.4   That as per <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 2(xxxiii)</a>, also as originally enacted, defining\n\n‘psychotropic substance’ shows that psychotropic substance includes “a\n\npreparation of such substance”. It is submitted that the said section has to be\n\nread with the Schedule appended to the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_27\">NDPS Act</a>. The Schedule itself, in Entry\n\n77, included “salts and preparation” of the list of psychotropic substance\n\nmentioned in Entry 1 to 76 of the Schedule. The original <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_28\">NDPS Act</a> therefore\n\ndealt with “preparations” of psychotropic substances. Further, contravention\n\nrelating to psychotropic substance was punishable under <a href=\"/doc/263398/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 22</a> of the\n\nNDPS Act and reading <a href=\"/doc/263398/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 22</a> with <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 2(xx)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_32\">2 (xxxiii)</a> and the\n\nSchedule makes it apparent that punishment covered preparation of psychotropic\n\nsubstance and was not based on pure substance content. Even <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 2(xiv)</a> of\n\nthe NDPS Act, as originally enacted, defined ‘narcotic drugs’, they were defined\n\nto mean (i) Coca leaf; (ii) Cannabis; (iii) Opium; (iv) Poppy Straw; and (v)\n\nManufactured drugs. Each of the above was defined separately. Therefore, even\n\nin the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_34\">NDPS Act</a>, as originally enacted, the ‘narcotic drugs’ included their\n\nmixtures and preparations. It is only in the definition of ‘poppy straw’ that the\n\nexpression mixture or preparation finds no mention;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">2.5   He argued that the only provision in the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_35\">NDPS Act</a>, as originally enacted,\n\nwhich specified the quantity was <a href=\"/doc/363765/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 27</a>, the said section mentioned “small\n\nquantity or narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance” and provided for milder\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                        5</span>\n\fpunishment where it is proved that possession in contravention of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_37\">NDPS Act</a>\n\nor rule was intended for personal consumption or there was consumption of any\n\nnarcotic drug or psychotropic substance. It is submitted that “small quantity”\n\nwas notified in Notification No. S.O.827 of 14.11.1985 which included only 5\n\ndrugs. By subsequent notifications, additions were made and more drugs were\n\nincluded in the list. Therefore the “small quantity” under the amended Act is\n\nmuch higher than that specified in the earlier notification under the original\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_38\">NDPS Act</a>. Thus, the NDPS Act, as originally enacted, insofar as narcotic drugs\n\nand psychotropic substances are concerned, only recognized “small quantity\n\nwhere possession was for personal consumption or there was consumption. The\n\npunishment prescribed under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_39\">NDPS Act</a>, originally enacted except in <a href=\"/doc/919170/\" id=\"a_40\">Section\n\n20</a> which in some circumstances contemplated imprisonment up to 5 years,\n\nprovided for punishment of not less than 10 years, but extendable to 20 years.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_41\">The NDPS Act</a>, as originally enacted, covered preparations of the narcotic drugs\n\nand psychotropic substances and not merely their pure drug content;\n\n2.6   That in the year 1989, the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_42\">NDPS Act</a> was amended by Act No.2 of 1989.\n\nThat notwithstanding the amendment, the original scheme of punishment under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_43\">NDPS Act</a> covering preparations and not just pure content was not interfered\n\nwith. In the year 2001, the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_44\">NDPS Act</a> was further amended and clauses (viia)\n\ndefining “commercial quantity” and (xxiiia) defining “small quantity” were\n\nadded. A bare look at the two sections shows that the same covered quantity\n\ngreater/lesser, as the case may be, than the “quantity specified” by the Central\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                       6</span>\n\fGovernment by notification in the official gazette of the narcotic drugs and\n\npsychotropic substances. Even in/after the 2001 amendment, no change was\n\nmade in the definition of “preparation” or in the definition of “narcotic drugs”\n\nand “psychotropic substances”, more particularly even after the addition of the\n\ndefinitions of “small quantity” and “commercial quantity”. Even the residuary\n\nentry in the list of Psychotropic Substances, i.e., Entry 77 in the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_45\">Schedule of the\n\nNDPS Act</a>, as originally enacted, is retained even after the amendment as ‘Entry\n\n111’ of the said Schedule. The only reason for the amendment in the year 2001\n\nwas that all preparations in the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_46\">NDPS Act</a>, as originally enacted, were uniformly\n\npunishable with imprisonment from 10 to 20 years and even the condition for\n\nbail did not make any reference to the quantity. It was for this reason that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 37</a> itself was amended to specifically deal with “commercial quantity”\n\nby the amendment of 2001;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">2.7   He argued that the “commercial quantity” would necessarily apply to\n\npreparations of narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances as the clauses which\n\nwere added needed to be read with the provisions of the statute which already\n\nstood therein and had not been amended. This was consistent with the scheme\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_48\">NDPS Act</a>, as originally enacted. The amendment did not in any manner\n\nwhatsoever tinker with the same. It is for this reason that the amended Act\n\nreferred in the newly inserted clauses to “commercial quantity” and “small\n\nquantity”.   The emphasis therefore was on the quantity in relation to the\n\ndrug/substance and not the content of the drug/substance. It was never the intent\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                        7</span>\n\fto modify the application of the statute to deal with pure quantity of the narcotic\n\ndrugs and psychotropic substance. The same came to be reinforced by the\n\nnotification published by the Central Government after coming of the 2001\n\nAmendment which contained Note 2 as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      “2. The quantities shown against the respective drugs listed above also\n      apply to the preparations of the drugs and the preparations of the\n      substances of Note 1 above.”\n\n\n\n       It is submitted that what was provided in Note 2 was always there since\n\nthe original enactment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">2.8    He argued that the “small quantity” now mentioned in the notification is\n\nmuch higher than the “small quantity” in the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_49\">NDPS Act</a> as originally enacted. It\n\nis for this reason that both <a href=\"/doc/363765/\" id=\"a_50\">Sections 27</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1226122/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 64A</a> have also been\n\namended. The possession having been taken out of <a href=\"/doc/363765/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 27</a>, there was no\n\nneed to provide for milder punishment for possession as under <a href=\"/doc/363765/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 27</a> of the\n\noriginal <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_54\">NDPS Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/363765/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 27</a> as amended therefore is confined to\n\n“consuming” any narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance only and the\n\nimmunity under <a href=\"/doc/1226122/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 64A</a> is limited to ‘addicts’ amongst those to whom\n\n<a href=\"/doc/363765/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 27</a> applies, in other words, possession even of “small quantity” is\n\noutside <a href=\"/doc/363765/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 27</a> of the amended Act and immunity is not available to all the\n\npersons to whom <a href=\"/doc/363765/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 27</a> applies but, only to such of them as are ‘addicts’.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">This is a change consequential upon the grading of punishment but, the\n\npunishment continues to relate only to the quantities of the narcotic drugs and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                        8</span>\n\fpsychotropic substance which includes their preparations and not the pure drug\n\ncontent;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813727\" id=\"span_18\">2.9   Even without Note 4 of the notification, the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_60\">NDPS Act</a> would apply to the\n\nentire mixture or solution of the narcotic drugs and psychotropic substance. It is\n\nfurther submitted that the addition of Note 4 under the notification of 2009, is\n\nirrelevant to the controversy and Judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_61\">E Micheal Raj</a> (supra) cannot be\n\nsustained even if Note 4 is ignored. The notification therefore does not in any\n\nmanner re-define the parameters for constituting an offence or awarding\n\npunishment under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_62\">NDPS Act</a>.</span> Shri Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor\n\nGeneral of India has heavily relied upon the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court\n\nin the case of Chapman v. United States (1991) 500 US 453 in support of his\n\nsubmission that the sentences should be based exclusively on the weight of the\n\n“mixture or substance” and not on the content – pure drug. It is submitted that\n\nin the said case, the petitioner was convicted of selling 10 sheets of blotter paper\n\ncontaining 1000 doses of LSD. The weight of LSD alone was approximately\n\n50mg and combined weight of the LSD and the blotter paper was 5.7 grams.\n\nThe petitioner was sentenced for mandatory minimum sentence of 5 years\n\nwhich was applicable for offences of distributing more than 1 gram of the\n\nsubstance. It is submitted that before the US Supreme Court, it was contended\n\non behalf of the petitioner that weight of the carrier should not be included\n\nwhen computing the appropriate sentence for LSD distribution.            The U.S.\n\nSupreme Court rejected the said contention and observed and held as under:\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                         9</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\f    “We think that petitioners reading of the statute, a reading that makes\n    the penalty turn on the net weight of the drug rather than the gross\n    weight of the carrier and drug together is not a plausible one. The\n    statute refers to a “mixture or substance containing a detectable\n    amount”. So long as it contains a detectable amount, the entire\n    mixture or substance is to be weighed when calculating the sentence.\n    This reading is confirmed by the structure of the statute. With respect\n    to various drugs, including heroin, cocaine, and LSD, it provides for\n    mandatory minimum sentences for crimes involving certain weights of\n    a “mixture or substance containing a detectable amount” of the drugs.\n    With respect to other drugs, however, namely phencyclidine (PCP) or\n    methamphetamine, it provides for a mandatory minimum sentence\n    based either on the weight of a mixture or substance containing a\n    detectable amount of the drug, or on lower weights of pure PCP or\n    methamphetamine. For example, S. 841(b)(1)(A)(iv) provides for a\n    mandatory 10 year minimum sentence for any person who distributes\n    “100 grams or more of … PCP…or 1 kilogram or more of a mixture\n    or substance containing a detectable amount of .. PCP…” Thus, with\n    respect to these two drugs, Congress clearly distinguished between the\n    pure drug and a “mixture or substance containing a detectable amount\n    of” the pure drug. But with respect to drugs such as LSD, which\n    petitioners distributed, Congress declared that sentences should be\n    based exclusively on the weight of the “mixture or substance”.\n    Congress knew how to indicate that the weight of the pure drug was to\n    be used to determine the sentence, and did not make that distinction\n    with respect to LSD.”\n    “…A “mixture” is defined to include “a portion of matter consisting of\n    two or more components that do not bear a fixed proportion to one\n    another….”\n    “…By measuring the quantity of the drugs according to the “street\n    weight” of the drugs in the diluted form in which they are sold,\n    **1928 rather than according to the net weight of the active\n    component, the statute and the Sentencing Guidelines increase the\n    penalty for persons who possess large quantities of drugs, regardless\n    of their purity. That is a rational sentencing scheme.”\n                                            (underline is ours)\n\n\n2.10 He argued that as such the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_63\">NDPS Act</a> does not make any distinction\n\nbetween pure drug and a preparation containing the drug. <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_64\">The Act</a> applies to the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                      10</span>\n\fstreet weight of the drug in the form in which they are sold rather than the net\n\nweight of the active component. This is what the Act has consistently been\n\nprovided since its inception. The appellants want this Court to read the statute in\n\na manner the provisions do not warrant. It is submitted that for instance, a\n\n“small quantity” of heroin is 5 grams, which if taken as only the pure drug\n\ncontent will translate into 100 grams of street level heroin. At the rate of 0.25\n\ngram heroin the mixture of 100 grams of heroin can yield about 400 doses of\n\nheroin. It can never nor could have been the intention of the legislature or for\n\nthat matter of the Government to send the person who possesses or sells heroin\n\nequivalent to 400 doses to a mere six months imprisonment. That therefore if\n\nthe submission on behalf of the appellants is accepted, in that case, it will be\n\ncontrary to the object and purposes of enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_65\">NDPS Act</a> and in most\n\nof the cases there will be no punishment for the “commercial quantity” and the\n\nreal culprits/accused will go away with the minor punishment;\n\n2.11 It is further argued that as per the Crawford on Interpretation of Law\n\n(Statutory Construction) “the Court should strive to avoid a construction which\n\nwill tend to make the statute unjust, oppressive, unreasonable, absurd,\n\nmischievous or contrary to the public interest. That construction should be\n\naccepted which will make the statute effective and productive of the most good,\n\nas it is presumed that these results were intended by the legislature. In order to\n\ncarry out the legislature intent, it is therefore apparent that the statute should be\n\ngiven a rational, logical and sensible interpretation”;\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                         11</span>\n\f2.12 It is further pointed out that the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_66\">NDPS Act</a> has been passed as per\n\nStatement of Object and Reasons, to “strengthen the existing controls over drug\n\nabuse, considerably enhanced the penalties particularly for trafficking offences,\n\nmake provisions for exercising effective control over psychotropic substances”.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">The stringency of control cannot disregard the conditions in which the Act\n\napplies. The definitions clearly show that the object of the Act was to deal with\n\nthe street weight of the drugs in the diluted form in which they are sold and not\n\nthe net weight of the active component. The legislature know that the inactive\n\ningredients will be combined with the pure drugs and substances and it would be\n\nthe drugs or substances so prepared that would be sold to the consumers. He\n\nargued, if the arguments of the appellants are accepted, the legislative intent\n\nwould be frustrated through a construction which will render the Act sterile and\n\nwhich in the circumstances in which the Act is to operate cannot be called either\n\nrational or sensible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1180389\" id=\"span_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"739213\" id=\"span_23\">2.13 Shri Lekhi, learned Additional Solicitor General of India has also relied\n\nupon the decision of this Court in the case of urlidhar <a href=\"/doc/739213/\" id=\"a_67\">Meghraj Loya and\n\nanother v.

The\n\nCentral Government did not have the power to issue the impugned notification\n\nby which it has empowered the inclusion of quantity of the neutral material also\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                       13</span>\n\falong with the quantity of the narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances in\n\ncolumns 5 &amp; 6 of the table, in relation to the narcotic drugs or psychotropic\n\nsubstances mentioned in the corresponding entry in column nos. 2 to 4 of the\n\nsaid table. Such power to include the neutral material is not provided under\n\nclauses (viia) and (xxiiia) of <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 2</a> of the NDPS Act. Thus, the impugned\n\nnotification dated 18.11.2019 is ultra vires the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_77\">NDPS Act</a>, read\n\nwith the amended 2001 Act which brought about rationalisation in awarding the\n\npunishment;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">3.2   By the impugned notification, Note 4 has been added after Note 3 at the\n\nend of the table appended to the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_78\">NDPS Act</a>, included vide Notification S.O.\n\n1055 (E) dated 19.10.2001, whereby the notification was issued specifying\n\n“small quantity” and “commercial quantity” of the narcotic drugs or\n\npsychotropic substances mentioned in column nos. 5 &amp; 6 of the table, in relation\n\nto the narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances mentioned in the corresponding\n\nentry in column nos. 2 to 4 of the said table;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">3.3   The result of the issuance of the impugned notification is that the offender\n\nwould be awarded the punishment by looking into the total quantity of the\n\nmaterial found in possession of the offender even if on chemical analysis it is\n\nfound that the actual content of the narcotic drug or psychotropic substance is\n\ncovered under the “small quantity”, but by adding the neutral material the\n\npunishment awarded is for “commercial quantity”. For instance, there are two\n\noffenders. One “A” is having quantity of 4 grams heroin which is less than the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                        14</span>\n\f“small quantity” which is 5 grams, mentioned in column no.5 of the table.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">Another “B” is in possession of 1 gram of heroin, but has mixed it with “neutral\n\nmaterial” of 250 grams, it becomes 251 grams, more than the “commercial\n\nquantity” which is 250 grams as per column no.6 of the table. It is submitted\n\nthat if these two offenders “A” and “B” are convicted, then “A” would be given\n\na punishment for 1 year while “B” can be given up to 20 years though actual\n\ncontent of the offending drug is lesser in case of “B”. It means one year\n\npunishment for heroin and 19 years for “neutral material” which is not otherwise\n\npunishable under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_79\">NDPS Act</a>. Thus, the effect of Note 4 is more the dilution,\n\nless the potency of the drug, but more the punishment. Therefore, it would lead\n\nto injustice and would lead to variation in the punishment of the accused\n\ndepending upon the quantity of the “neutral material” instead of the “drug\n\nmaterial”;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">3.4   The only power given to the Government is to increase or reduce the\n\nquantity of the narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance mentioned in column\n\nno.5 and 6 and nothing more. For instance, in the case of heroin, the quantity\n\nfor the “small quantity” can be reduced from 5 gram to 1 gram, and for\n\n“commercial quantity”, it can also be reduced from 250 grams to 100 grams or\n\nso, but no “neutral material” can be permitted to be added to award the quantum\n\nof punishment;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">3.5   No “neutral material” has been specified in column no.2 or column no.4\n\nof the table.

Since “neutral material” is neither a narcotic\n\ndrug nor a psychotropic substance, it has not been mentioned under column nos.\n\n2 and 4 and, therefore, cannot be made punishable under Note 4;\n\n3.6   In the year 2001, <a href=\"/doc/1997854/\" id=\"a_81\">NDPS (Amendment) Act, 2001</a> was brought to\n\nrationalise the quantum of punishment for addicts and less serious offenders and\n\nsevere punishment for serious offenders;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813727\" id=\"span_31\">3.7   This Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_82\">E.Micheal Raj</a> (supra) held that only the\n\nquantity of the offending article is to be taken into consideration for the purpose\n\nof punishment.

Where ever\n\n“neutral material” was to be included it has been specified under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_90\">NDPS Act</a>\n\nitself.

Even\n\nin the word “preparation”, the reference is again to one or more of such drugs or\n\npsychotropic substances, but there is no reference to any “neutral material”.\n\n3.11 Making the above submissions, it is submitted that thus the Central\n\nGovernment has no power to make any amendment in Act No. 9 of 2001 and\n\nmake the whole of the quantity of the allegedly recovered material from the\n\noffender as the “small, commercial or non-commercial quantity”, by directing\n\nthe inclusion of the “neutral substance” in it.

Thus, the “chemical name”, which identifies a particular\n\nsubstance in terms of its actual chemical composition, is relevant for\n\ndetermining the quantity of such substance. If it were not, there would be no\n\nneed to have column 4 and the chemical description of a substance in the 2001\n\nnotification, which lays down small and commercial quantity of narcotic drugs\n\nand psychotropic substances;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">5.2   The only drugs for which the entry in column (4) for chemical name is not\n\ngiven in the 2001 notification are ‘natural/plant-based drugs’ namely, Cannabis\n\nand cannabis resin (Charas, Hashish) at S.

At this stage, it is\n\nrequired to be noted that as such and after the decision of this Court in the case\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_118\">E.Micheal Raj</a> (supra) by Notification No.S.O.2942(E) dated 18.11.2009,\n\n“Note 4” has been added to         Notification S.O.1055(E) dated 19.10.2001\n\nspecifying the “small quantity and commercial quantity” of the narcotic drugs\n\nor psychotropic substances covered under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_119\">NDPS Act</a>.

As per the Notification dated\n\n19.10.2001 in case of Heroin 5gms is a small quantity and 250 gm is a\n\ncommercial quantity. However, this Court considered the substance seized –\n\nHeroin as Opium derivative and hence a manufactured drug and therefore,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                       25</span>\n\ftreating the seized drug as opium derivative, this Court held the seized material\n\nas small quantity and awarded punishment accordingly. While holding so, this\n\nCourt considered the Statement of Objects and Reasons concerning the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1843514/\" id=\"a_126\">Amendment Act, 2001</a> and thereafter observed in para 12 to 15 as under:</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">            “12. The possession of offending substance would be\n            considered an offence punishable under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_127\">NDPS Act</a>, as\n            heroin is an opium derivative as per <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_128\">Section 2(xvi)(e)</a>\n            which says that all preparations containing more than 0.2\n            percent of morphine or containing any diacetylmorphineµ\n            is an opium derivative. Further, according to <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_129\">Section\n            2(xi)</a>, all opium derivatives fall under the category of\n            manufactured drug. Thus, we conclude that the offending\n            substance is an opium derivative and hence a\n            manufactured drug, the possession of which is in\n            contravention of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_130\">Section 8</a> of the NDPS\n            Act which prohibits certain operations to the effect that no\n            person shall produce, manufacture, possess, sell,\n            purchase, transport, warehouse, use, consume, import\n            inter-State, export inter-State, import into India, export\n            from India or tranship any narcotic drug or psychotropic\n            substance.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">            13.

The question is only\n            with regard to the quantum of punishment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">            14. As a consequence of the <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_133\">Amending Act</a>, the sentence\n            structure underwent a drastic change. <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_134\">The Amending Act</a>\n            for the first time introduced the concept of commercial\n            quantity in relation to narcotic drugs or psychotropic\n            substances by adding clause (viia) in <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 2</a>, which\n            defines this term as any quantity greater than a quantity\n            specified by the Central Government by notification in the\n            Official Gazette. Further, the term &#x27;small quantity&#x27; is\n            defined in <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 2</a>, clause (xxiiia), as any quantity lesser\n            than the quantity specified by the Central Government by\n            notification in the Official Gazette. Under the rationalised\n            sentence structure, the punishment would vary depending\n            upon whether the quantity of offending material is &#x27;small\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                       26</span>\n\f            quantity&#x27;, `commercial quantity or something in-between.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">            15. It appears from the Statement of Objects and Reasons\n            of the Amending Act of 2001 that the intention of the\n            legislature was to rationalize the sentence structure so as\n            to ensure that while drug traffickers who traffic in\n            significant quantities of drugs are punished with deterrent\n            sentence, the addicts and those who commit less serious\n            offences are sentenced to less severe punishment. Under\n            the rationalised sentence structure, the punishment would\n            vary depending upon the quantity of offending material.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">            Thus, we find it difficult to accept the argument advanced\n            on behalf of the respondent that the rate of purity is\n            irrelevant since any preparation which is more than the\n            commercial quantity of 250 gms. and contains 0.2% of\n            heroin or more would be punishable under <a href=\"/doc/197387625/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 21(c)</a>\n            of the NDPS Act, because the intention of the legislature\n            as it appears to us is to levy punishment based on the\n            content of the offending drug in the mixture and not on the\n            weight of the mixture as such. This may be tested on the\n            following rationale. Supposing 4 gms. of heroin is\n            recovered from an accused, it would amount to a small\n            quantity, but when the same 4 gms. is mixed with 50 kgs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813727\" id=\"span_52\">of the powered sugar, it would be quantified as a\n            commercial quantity. In the mixture of a narcotic drug or a\n            psychotropic substance with one or more neutral\n            substance/s, the quantity of the neutral substance/s is not\n            to be taken into consideration while determining the small\n            quantity or commercial quantity of a narcotic drug or\n            psychotropic substance. It is only the actual content by\n            weight of the narcotic drug which is relevant for the\n            purposes of determining whether it would constitute small\n            quantity or commercial quantity. The intention of the\n            legislature for introduction of the amendment as it appear\n            to us is to punish the people who commit less serious\n            offences with less severe punishment and those who\n            commit grave crimes, such as trafficking in significant\n            quantities, with more severe punishment.”\n\n\n6.3.   On considering the aforesaid reasoning given by this Court in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_138\">E.Micheal Raj</a> (Supra), we are of the opinion that while holding that in the\n\nmixture of a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance with one or more neutral\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                       27</span>\n\fsubstance, the quantity of neutral substance is not to be taken into consideration\n\nand it is only the actual content by weight of the narcotic drug which is relevant\n\nfor the purposes of determining whether it would constitute “small quantity or\n\ncommercial quantity”, this Court has not at all considered the relevant entry in\n\nthe Notification dated 19.10.2001. As observed herein above, what was seized\n\nwas heroin which falls in Entry 56. What was seized was not opium and / or\n\nopium derivative. There is no specific finding even given by this Court that it\n\nwould fall under Entry 239 namely any mixture or preparation that of with or\n\nwithout the neutral material. Therefore, the case of mixture of narcotic drugs or\n\npsychotropic substance was not at all in direct consideration of this Court.\n\n6.4.   Even it does not appear that this Court took into consideration Note 2 of\n\nthe Notification dated 19.10.2001, which reads as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813727\" id=\"span_54\">“The quantities shown against the respective drugs listed\n           above also apply to the preparations of the drug and the\n           preparations of substances of note 1 above.”\n\n\n       If note 2 would have been considered by this Court and seized material\n\nwas “Heroin” <a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_139\">in that case</a> and what was seized was 4.5 kg heroin, the Court\n\nwould have considered the same as a “commercial quantity” as considering\n\nEntry 56, 5gms is “small quantity” and 250 gms and above is a “commercial\n\nquantity”.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813727\" id=\"span_55\">Therefore, as such, we are not in agreement with the view taken by\n\nthis Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_140\">E.Micheal Raj</a> (Supra) taking the view that in mixture\n\nof a narcotic drug or psychotropic substance with one or more neutral\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                        28</span>\n\fsubstance, the quantity of neutral substance is not to be taken into consideration\n\nand it is only the actual content by weight of the narcotic drug which is relevant\n\nfor the purposes of determining whether it would constitute “small quantity or\n\ncommercial quantity”.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">7.    Even considering the reasons while arriving at aforesaid conclusion, it\n\nappears to us that the Statement of Objects and Reasons concerning the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1843514/\" id=\"a_141\">Amendment Act, 2001</a> has not been properly appreciated and/or considered\n\nand/or properly construed. Considering the statement of objects and reasons\n\nconcerning the Amendment Act of 2001, by which, two tier punishment was\n\nprovided one for small quantity and another for commercial quantity, it cannot\n\nbe said that intention of the legislature was to consider only the actual content\n\nby weight of offending drug for the purpose of determining whether it would\n\nconstitute small quantity or commercial quantity. The Statement of Objects and\n\nReasons of the Amendment Act, 2001 is as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">          “ The Statement of Objects and Reasons concerning the\n          <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_142\">Amending Act</a> of 2001 is as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">          <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_143\">Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985</a>\n          provides deterrent punishment for various offences relating to\n          illicit trafficking in narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.\n          Most of the offences invite uniform punishment of minimum ten\n          years&#x27; rigorous imprisonment which may extend up to twenty\n          years. <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_144\">While the Act</a> envisages severe punishments for drug\n          traffickers, it envisages reformative approach towards addicts.\n          In view of the general delay in trial it has been found that the\n          addicts prefer not to invoke the provisions of the Act. The strict\n          bail provisions under the Act add to their misery.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">          Therefore, it is proposed to rationalise the sentence structure so\n          as to ensure that while drug traffickers who traffic in significant\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                       29</span>\n\f          quantities of drugs are punished with deterrent sentences, the\n          addicts and those who commit less serious offences are\n          sentenced to less severe punishment. This requires\n          rationalisation of the sentence structure provided under the Act.\n          It is also proposed to restrict the application of strict bail\n          provisions to those offenders who indulge in serious offences.”\n\n\n      On a bare reading of the Statement of Objects and Reasons, it cannot be\n\nsaid that the intention of the Legislature was to consider the actual content by\n\nweight of the offending drug for the purpose of determining whether it would\n\nconstitute small quantity or commercial quantity. Therefore, we are of the\n\nopinion while holding that it is only the actual content by weight of the\n\noffending drug to be considered for the purpose of determining whether it\n\nwould constitute small quantity or commercial quantity, this Court has read\n\nmore than what was stated in the Statement of Objects and Reasons.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813727\" id=\"span_58\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813727\" id=\"span_59\">7.1   Therefore, while deciding the case in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_145\">E.Micheal Raj</a> (Supra),\n\nthis Court had not at all considered Note 2 to the Notification dated 19.10.2001\n\nand has read much more than what is stated in the Statement of Objects and\n\nReasons of Amendment Act, 2001 and for the reasons stated herein below, even\n\non merits also, we are not in agreement with the view taken by this Court in the\n\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_146\">E.Micheal Raj</a> (Supra) that for the purpose of determining the “small or\n\ncommercial quantity” in relation to narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances in\n\na mixture with one or more neutral substance(s), the quantity of neutral\n\nsubstance(s) is not to be taken into consideration or it is only the actual content\n\nby weight of the offending drug which is relevant.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813727\" id=\"span_60\">At this stage, it is required to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                        30</span>\n\fbe noted that even before this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_147\">E.Micheal Raj</a> (Supra), it was\n\na case of “heroin” and not at all case of mixture falling in entry 239 of the\n\nNotification dated 19.10.2001.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">8.     On merits whether any mixture of narcotic drugs or psychotropic\n\nsubstances with one or more neutral substance(s)         the quantity of neutral\n\nsubstance(s) is not to be taken into consideration or it is only the actual content\n\nby weight of the offending drug which is relevant for the purpose of\n\ndetermining whether it would constitute “small quantity or commercial\n\nquantity”, the Statement of Objects and Reasons of NDPS Act is required to be\n\nconsidered. As per the preamble of <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_148\">NDPS Act, 1985</a>, it is an Act to consolidate\n\nand amend the law relating to Narcotic Drugs, to make stringent provisions for\n\nthe control and regulation of operation relating to Narcotic Drugs and\n\nPsychotropic Substances. To provide for forfeiture of the property derived\n\nfrom or use in illicit traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance. The\n\nStatement of objects and reasons and the preamble of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_149\">NDPS Act</a> imply that\n\nthe Act is required to act as a deterrent and the provisions must be stringent\n\nenough to ensure that the same Act as deterrents.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">8.1.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1013766\" id=\"span_62\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/1013766/\" id=\"a_150\">Directorate of Enforcement vs. Deepak Mahajan and\n\nAnother</a> reported in (1994) 3 SCC 440, it is observed by this Court that every\n\nlaw is designed to further ends of justice but not to frustrate on the mere\n\ntechnicalities. It is further observed that though the intention of the Court is\n\nonly to expound the law and not to legislate, nonetheless the legislature cannot\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                        31</span>\n\fbe asked to sit to resolve the difficulties in the implementation of its intention\n\nand the spirit of the law. It is the duty of the Court to mould or creatively\n\ninterpret the legislation by liberally interpreting the statute. In <a href=\"/doc/1013766/\" id=\"a_151\">the said decision</a>\n\nthis Court has also quoted following passage in Maxwell on Interpretation of\n\nStatutes, 10th Edition page 229:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">              &quot;Where the language of a statute, in its ordinary\n              meaning and grammatical construction, leads to a\n              manifest contradiction of the apparent purpose of the\n              enactment, or to some inconvenience or absurdity,\n              hardship or injustice, presumably not intended, a\n              construction may be put upon it which modifies the\n              meaning of the words, and even the structure of the\n              sentence. ... Where the main object and intention of a\n              statute are clear, it must not be reduced to a nullity by\n              the draftsman&#x27;s unskilfulness or ignorance of the law,\n              except in a case of necessity, or the absolute\n              intractability of the language used.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">      Thereafter, it is further observed that to winch up the legislative intent, it\n\nis permissible for courts to take into account the ostensible purpose and object\n\nand the real legislative intent. Otherwise, a bare mechanical interpretation of the\n\nwords and application of the legislative intent devoid of concept of purpose and\n\nobject will render the legislature inane. It is further observed that in given\n\ncircumstances, it is permissible for courts to have functional approaches and\n\nlook into the legislative intention and sometimes it may be even necessary to go\n\nbehind the words and enactment and take other factors into consideration to\n\ngive effect to the legislative intention and to the purpose and spirit of the\n\nenactment so that no absurdity or practical inconvenience may result and the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                         32</span>\n\flegislative exercise and its scope and object may not become futile.\n\n8.2   Therefore, considering the statement of objects and reasons and the\n\npreamble of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_152\">NDPS Act</a> and the relevant provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_153\">NDPS Act</a>, it\n\nseems that it was never the intention of the legislature to exclude the quantity of\n\nneutral substance and to consider only the actual content by weight of\n\noffending drug which is relevant for the purpose of determining whether it\n\nwould constitute small quantity or commercial quantity. Right from sub-clause\n\n(viia) and (xxiiia) of <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 2</a> of NDPS Act emphasis is on Narcotic and Drug\n\nor Psychotropic Substance (<a href=\"/doc/1566465/\" id=\"a_155\">Sections 21</a>, <a href=\"/doc/263398/\" id=\"a_156\">22</a>, <a href=\"/doc/654722/\" id=\"a_157\">23</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_158\">24</a>, <a href=\"/doc/363765/\" id=\"a_159\">27</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_160\">43</a>). Even in the\n\ntable attached to the Notification dated 19.10.2001, column no. 2 is with respect\n\nto name of Narcotic Drug and Psychotropic Substance and column nos. 5 and 6\n\nare with respect to “small quantity and commercial quantity”. Note 2 of the\n\nNotification dated 19.10.2001 specifically provides that quantity shown against\n\nthe respective drugs listed in the table also apply to the preparations of the drug\n\nand the preparations of substances of note 1. As per Note 1, the small quantity\n\nand commercial quantity given against the respective drugs listed in the table\n\napply to isomers ..., whenever existence of such substance is possible.\n\nTherefore, for the determination of “small quantity or the commercial quantity”\n\nwith respect to Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance mentioned in\n\ncolumn no.2 the quantity mentioned in the clauses 5 and 6 are required to be\n\ntaken into consideration. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813727\" id=\"span_65\">However, in the case of mixture of the narcotic drugs /\n\npsychotropic drugs mentioned in column no.2 and any mixture or preparation\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                        33</span>\n\fthat of with or without the neutral material of any of the drugs mentioned in\n\ntable, lesser of the small quantity between the quantities given against the\n\nrespective Narcotic Drugs or Psychotropic Substances forming part of mixture\n\nand lesser of commercial quantity between the quantities given against the\n\nrespective narcotic drugs or psychotropic substance forming part of the mixture\n\nis to be taken into consideration. As per example, mixture of 100 gm is seized\n\nand the mixture is consisting of two different Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\n\nSubstance with neutral material, one drug is heroin and another is methadone,\n\nlesser of commercial quantity between the quantities given against the aforesaid\n\ntwo respective Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substance is required to be\n\nconsidered.   For the purpose of determination of the “small quantity or\n\ncommercial quantity”, in case of entry 239 the entire weight of the mixture /\n\ndrug by whatever named called weight of neutral material is also required to be\n\nconsidered subject to what is stated hereinabove. If the view taken by this Court\n\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_161\">E. Micheal Raj</a> (Supra) is accepted<a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_162\">, <a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_163\">in that case</a></a>, it would be\n\nadding something to the relevant provisions of the statute which is not there\n\nand/or it was never intended by the legislature.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">8.3   At this stage, it is required to be noted that illicit drugs are seldom sold in\n\na pure form. They are almost always adulterated or cut with other substance.\n\nCaffeine is mixed with heroin, it causes that heroin to vaporize at a lower rate.\n\nThat could allow users to take the drug faster and get a big punch sooner.\n\nAspirin, crushed tablets, they could have enough powder to amend reversal\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                        34</span>\n\fdoses of drugs. Take example of heroin. It is known as powerful and illegal\n\nstreet drug and opiate derived from morphine. This drug can easily be “cut”\n\nwith a variety of different substances. This means that drug dealer will add other\n\ndrugs or non -intoxicating substances to the drug so that they can sell more of it\n\nat a lesser expense to themselves. Brown-sugar / smack is usually made\n\navailable in power form. The substances is only about 20% heroin. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813727\" id=\"span_68\">The heroin\n\nis mixed with other substances like chalk powder, zinc oxide, because of these,\n\nimpurities in the drug, brown-sugar is cheaper but more dangerous. These are\n\nonly few examples to show and demonstrate that even mixture of narcotic drugs\n\nor psychotropic substance is more dangerous. Therefore, what is harmful or\n\ninjurious is the entire mixture/tablets with neutral substance and Narcotic Drugs\n\nor Psychotropic Substances. Therefore, if it is accepted that it is only the actual\n\ncontent by weight of offending drug which is relevant for the purpose of\n\ndetermining whether it would constitute small quantity or commercial quantity<a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_164\">,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1813727/\" id=\"a_165\">in that case</a></a>, the object and purpose of enactment of <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_166\">NDPS Act</a> would be\n\nfrustrated. There may be few punishment for “commercial quantity”. Certainly\n\nthat would not have been the intention of the legislature.\n\n8.4.   Even considering the definition of “manufacture”, “manufactured drug”\n\nand the “preparation” conjointly, the total weight of such “manufactured drug”\n\nor “preparation”, including the neutral material is required to be considered\n\nwhile determining small quantity or commercial quantity. If it is interpreted in\n\nsuch a manner, then and then only, the objects and purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_167\">NDPS Act</a> would\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                                        35</span>\n\fbe achieved. Any other intention to defeat the object and purpose of enactment\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_168\">NDPS Act</a> viz. to Act is deterrent.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">8.5.   The problem of drug addicts is international and the mafia is working\n\nthroughout the world. It is a crime against the society and it has to be dealt with\n\niron hands. Use of drugs by the young people in India has increased. The drugs\n\nare being used for weakening of the nation. During the British regime control\n\nwas kept on the traffic of dangerous drugs by enforcing the Opium Act, 1857.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/72261612/\" id=\"a_169\">The Opium Act, 1875</a> and the Dangerous Drugs Act, 1930. However, with the\n\npassage of time and the development in the field of illicit drug traffic and during\n\nabuse at national and international level, many deficiencies in the existing laws\n\nhave come to notice. Therefore, in order to remove such deficiencies and\n\ndifficulties, there was urgent need for the enactment of a comprehensive\n\nlegislation on Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances, which led to\n\nenactment of <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_170\">NDPS Act</a>. As observed herein above, the Act is a special law and\n\nhas a laudable purpose to serve and is intended to combat the menace otherwise\n\nbent upon destroying the public health and national health. The guilty must be\n\nin and the innocent ones must be out. The punishment part in drug trafficking is\n\nan important one but its preventive part is more important. Therefore,\n\nprevention of illicit traffic in <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_171\">Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,\n\n1988</a> came to be introduced. The aim was to prevent illicit traffic rather than\n\npunish after the offence was committed. Therefore, the Courts will have to\n\nsafeguard the life and liberty of the innocent persons. Therefore, the provisions\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                        36</span>\n\fof <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_172\">NDPS Act</a> are required to be interpreted keeping in mind the object and\n\npurpose of <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_173\">NDPS Act</a>; impact on the society as a whole and the Act is required\n\nto be interpreted literally and not liberally which may ultimately frustrate the\n\nobject, purpose and preamble of the Act. Therefore, the interpretation of the\n\nrelevant provisions of the statute canvassed on behalf of the accused and the\n\nintervener that quantity of neutral substance (s) is not to be taken into\n\nconsideration and it is only actual content of the weight of the offending drug,\n\nwhich is relevant for the purpose of determining whether it would constitute\n\n“small quantity or commercial quantity”, cannot be accepted.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">9.    Now, so far as the challenge to the impugned Notification No.2942(E)\n\ndated 18.11.2009 issued by the Union of India, by which, “Note 4” has been\n\nadded to the Notification S.O.1055(E) dated 19.10.2001 specifying small\n\nquantity and commercial quantity of the narcotic drugs and psychotropic\n\nsubstance covered under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_174\">NDPS Act, 1985</a> is concerned, as such it can be\n\nsaid to be clarificatory in nature and / or by way of ex abundanti cautela /\n\nabundant caution. As observed herein above, while determining the small or\n\ncommercial quantity in relation to narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances in\n\na mixture with one or more neutral substance(s), it includes the weight of\n\nneutral substance (s) also and not only the actual content by weight of the\n\noffending drug.

Even otherwise, for the reasons stated above, the impugned Notification\n\ndated 18.11.2009 adding “Note 4” to the earlier Notification dated 19.10.2001,\n\ncannot be said to be contrary to the scheme and the various provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_178\">NDPS Act</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">9.1.

Notification dated 19.10.2001 specifies\n\nthe small quantity and commercial quantity with respect to respective narcotic\n\ndrugs and psychotropic substances.
