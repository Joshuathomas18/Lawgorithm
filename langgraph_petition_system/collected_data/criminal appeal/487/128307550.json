According  to  the  learned  Public\n\nProsecutor the act of deliberately hitting the\n\nhead        on the wall must necessarily show that\n\nthe first accused has the           necessary intention\n\nto cause death or atleast the knowledge that\n\ncausing that injury shall be sufficient in the\n\nordinary         course   of  nature  to  cause  death.\n\nAccording to the learned Public Prosecutor,it\n\nis this fact which             had persuaded the court\n\nbelow to come to the conclusion that offence\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 302</a> I.P.C. is attracted and there\n\nis no reason to take a different view.\n\f\nCrl.Appeal.753/2009.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                             13</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">             9.

As far as the evidence of P.W.5 is\n\nconcerned, the court below has not chosen to\n\naccept the dying declaration of the deceased\n\nfor the reasons mentioned in the judgment.

According to learned counsel for\n\nthe accused, the evidence of D.W.1,          the only\n\nwitness from the defence side was not properly\n\nappreciated by the court below. He claims to be\n\nrelated to both the parties.         It is pointed out\n\f\nCrl.Appeal.753/2009.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                             20</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">\n\nthat      both      the accused and  the  victim  are\n\nrelatives and neighbours also.           D.W.1 stated\n\nthat the incident occurred while accused No.2,\n\nwife of accused No.1 was on her way back from\n\nmarket after purchasing           provisions for the\n\nhouse.        When she reached in front of the house\n\nof P.W.1, she was attacked by the inmates of\n\nthe said house and hearing her cry, accused\n\nNo.1 had come to the spot.           The evidence of\n\nD.W.1 cannot be accepted for more than one\n\nreason.         There was absolutely no suggestion to\n\nP.Ws.1 to 4 to the effect that the incident has\n\nnot occurred as alleged by the prosecution and\n\nhas taken place in the road in front of their\n\nhouse.         At least one would have expected    to\n\nmake an attempt to establish that the incident\n\nhas not occurred as alleged by P.Ws.1 and 2.\n\nThere is not even a remote suggestion to P.Ws.1\n\nto 4 that the incident had not occurred in the\n\f\nCrl.Appeal.753/2009.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                             21</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">\n\ncourtyard of the house of P.W.1, but        had taken\n\nplace on the road           in front of the house of\n\nP.Ws.1 and 2.            It is very clear that the\n\nevidence         adduced through  D.W.1  is  a  clear\n\nafterthought         and as  rightly noticed  by  the\n\ncourt below does not warrant acceptance.

The next question that arises for\n\nconsideration is          what is the cause of death of\n\nLalitha        Kumari.      Ext.P9  is  the  postmortem\n\ncertificate          and  P.W.11   is the   doctor  who\n\nconducted autopsy.          Ext.P9 postmortem shows the\n\nfollowing injuries:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      &quot;Injuries(Antemortem)\n                    On  dissection,  there  was   a\n      contusion, 5 x 3 cm on the deep layers\n      of the scalp, just above the occiput.\n      Skull was intact.          Brain showed think\n      subdural        bleeding involving  the  left\n      half, contusion of the under surface of\n      frontal lobes and features of increased\n      intracranial tension.&quot;\n</blockquote>\f\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">Crl.Appeal.753/2009.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                              24</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">\n\nThe cause of death, according to P.W.11, is\n\ndue to head injury.          It is true that P.W.11 in\n\nhis evidence has stated that he had no occasion\n\nto    see       the   case  records  relating  to  the\n\ndeceased.          But, he was definite that death was\n\ndue to the injuries on the head and it could\n\nhave been caused while hitting the head of the\n\ndeceased against the wall.         The cause of death,\n\nto     be      more   precise,  is   the  deceleration\n\ninjuries to the brain.            There is nothing to\n\nshow       that     subsequent  to  the  incident  the\n\ndeceased has         fallen in the ground by which she\n\ncould       have     sustained  the  injuries.     The\n\nevidence of           P.W.11 taken along with Ext.P9\n\nshows that Lalitha Kumari died as a result of\n\nthe injuries suffered on the head and that the\n\ndeath was homicidal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">             23.    The next question that arises for\n\nconsideration         is  whether  it  was  the  first\n\f\nCrl.Appeal.753/2009.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                              25</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">\n\naccused        who   had  inflicted  injuries  to  the\n\ndeceased.           The evidence of P.Ws.1, 3 and 4\n\nleave one in no doubt that the accused had\n\npulled her out of the house and had thrown her\n\noutside.          When she tried to stand up, he hit\n\nher head against the          wall.  There is nothing\n\nto    indicate       that  there  was  any  subsequent\n\nincident in which Lalitha Kumary could have\n\nsustained injuries.         It is true that the doctor\n\nwho examined her in the Government Hospital,\n\nMavelikkara         did  not   find any   internal  or\n\nexternal injuries.          But going by the medical\n\nevidence, it is not always necessary that in\n\nsuch       acceleration    or   deceleration  injuries\n\nexternal         injuries  must   be  noticed.     The\n\nevidence also shows that the victim developed\n\nfits during the night which is the typical\n\nsymptom of deceleration injury.         It was in that\n\ncontext she had to be removed to the Medical\n\f\nCrl.Appeal.753/2009.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                              26</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">\n\nCollege Hospital.           It is also clear from the\n\nevidence that she died due to the injuries\n\nsuffered by her on hitting her head against the\n\nwall. At any rate, death of Lalitha Kumari, the\n\ndaughter of P.Ws.1 and 2 was caused due to the\n\nhead injury inflicted by the accused.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">             24.     What now remains to be considered\n\nis    what       is   the  offence  committed  by   the\n\naccused.         In the decision reported in Thomas&#x27;s\n\ncase       (supra),      this  court   considered   the\n\nquestion         whether   when  death  is  caused   by\n\nfisting        with   hands,  what  is  the  nature  of\n\noffence         that could be attracted in the facts\n\nof the case.          In the said case, it is seen that\n\nthe accused inflicted fist injury on the eye of\n\nthe      deceased       and  later   on  he   developed\n\nsub-dural          haematoma  and  died  due  to   head\n\ninjury.          Analysing the relevant provisions of\n\nthe     <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_28\">I.P.C</a>.,      the   court  observed  that  while\n\f\nCrl.Appeal.753/2009.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                             27</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">\n\nfisting, the accused did not have the intention\n\nto cause the death of the victim or had the\n\nintention to inflict such bodily injury, which\n\nin the ordinary course of nature, would cause\n\ndeath of the person concerned.          The court was\n\nalso of the opinion that the act of the accused\n\ncould       not     be brought within  the  ambit  of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_29\">Section        299</a>   of the  I.P.C.  also  because  no\n\nknowledge as such could be attributed to him.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">             25.

In\n\nthe     case      relied on  by  the  learned  counsel\n\ndeath caused due to the fisting on the face of\n\nthe deceased. It could be said that the act was\n\ndone with the intention of causing death.         The\n\ninjuries could          be said to be on the vital\n\nparts of the body.        It was in that context that\n\f\nCrl.Appeal.753/2009.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                              28</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">\n\nthe court held that offence under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 323</a>\n\nI.P.C. alone is attracted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">             26.    In the case on hand, it was due to\n\nhitting the head of the victim against the wall\n\nby the appellant.

It  is  also\n\ndifficult, going by the evidence on record, to\n\ncome       to     the  conclusion  that  he  had   the\n\nintention to inflict that injury which in the\n\nordinary course of nature would cause death of\n\nthe victim.
