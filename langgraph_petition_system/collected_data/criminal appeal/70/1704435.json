PA) made by Harwinder Singh (PW1), on the basis of which formal\n\nFIR Ex. PA/3 was recorded at 2.15 AM on November 8, 1998, in Police\n\nStation Dera Baba Nanak.        Special report reached the concerned Ilaqa\n\nMagistrate at Batala, at 12.00 noon, on the same day.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">             Case of the prosecution, as noted by the trial Court in para No.\n\n3 of the impugned judgment, reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             &quot;On 7.11.1998, at about 9 PM, Harwinder Singh along with\n\n             Kulwinder Singh, were going out for their Tubewell, situated in\n\n             the outskirts of the village, by the &#x27;Phirni&#x27;. On the way, they\n\n             met Rajinder Singh alias Brahman son of Gurbux Singh, who\n\n             was coming on a cycle from the opposite direction. Cycle of\n\n             Rajinder Singh struck against Kulwinder Singh as a result\n\n             whereof some altercation ensued between Kulwinder Singh and\n\n             Rajinder Singh.     In the meanwhile, Sukhwinder Singh alias\n\n             Chhinda and Balwinder Singh, brothers of Rajinder Singh, also\n\n             came at the spot and started pelting brick bats as a result\n\n             whereof Ranjit Singh son of Santokh Singh, cousin of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL     NO. 426-DB OF 2001             -3-</span>\n\n       Kulwinder Singh sustained injuries. Ranjit Singh injured was\n\n       shifted to the Civil Hospital Dera Baba Nanak by Harwinder\n\n       Singh, Kulwinder Singh, Makhan Singh and Joginder Kaur.\n\n       Said Joginder Kaur is none else but the mother of Ranjit Singh.\n\n       After admitting Ranjit Singh, in the hospital all the four namely\n\n       Harwinder Singh, Kulwinder Singh, Makhan Singh and\n\n       Joginder Kaur, set out for their village. Kulwinder Singh and\n\n       Joginder Kaur were on a scooter and they were being followed\n\n       by Makhan Singh and Harwinder Singh, on a tractor. When\n\n       Kulwinder Singh and Joginder Kaur reached near Pakhoke in\n\n       the area of village Chandu Nangal, at about 12.30 mid-night, all\n\n       the accused, namely, Sukhwinder Singh, Surinder Singh, Beer\n\n       Singh and Balwinder Singh, duly armed with Dangs appeared\n\n       there on a Tractor. The accused persons stopped the Tractor in\n\n       front of the scooter of Kulwinder Singh, dragged said\n\n       Kulwinder Singh, in the nearby paddy fields and gave him\n\n       Dang blows. Rajinder Singh gave a Dang blow to Kulwinder\n\n       Singh, which hit on the left side of his forehead. Sukhwinder\n\n       Singh gave Dang blow which hit Kulwinder Singh on the right\n\n       side of his forehead. Beer Singh, accused gave a Dang blow to\n\n       Kulwinder Singh, which hit on his head. Balwinder Singh and\n\n       Surinder Singh accused also gave Dang blows to Kulwinder\n\n       Singh, which hit on his right flank, back side of left shoulder\n\n       and head.    Thereafter Kulwinder Singh raised death alarm,\n\n       consequent whereupon all the accused fled away along with\n\n       their weapons, leaving their Tractor at the spot of occurrence.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL          NO. 426-DB OF 2001              -4-</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            This occurrence was witnessed by Harwinder Singh, Makhan\n\n            Singh and Joginder Kaur. Kulwinder Singh, was taken to Civil\n\n            Hospital Dera Baba Nanak on the Tractor, but he breathed his\n\n            last on the way.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">            It was further case of the prosecution that Harawinder Singh\n\nleft Makhan Singh (PW2) near the dead body and himself went to the Police\n\nStation to lodge a report. On his way, he met the Investigating Officer - SI\n\nSurjit Singh (PW12), who recorded his statement, whereupon FIR was\n\nregistered against the appellant - accused.      The Investigating Officer\n\nprepared inquest report of the dead body and sent it for post-mortem\n\nexamination, which was conducted by Dr. Gurmit Singh Chhina (PW10) on\n\nNovember 8, 1998, at 3 PM. He found the following injuries on the person\n\nof the deceased:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">            &quot;1. Reddish abrasion 1 ½ x ½ cm on left side of forehead 2 cm\n\n            from midline and 4 cm left upper eye brow.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">            2. Reddish abrasion 1 x ½ cm on right side of forehead 1 cm\n\n              below anterior hair-line and 6 cm from right eye brow.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">            3. Diffused swelling 8 cm x 7 cm on left part of occipital region\n\n              behind right ear.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">            4. Scabbed 3 ½ x 1 ½ cm on right side of lower part of chest 19\n\n              cm below right nipple.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">            5. Reddish abrasion 1 ½ x ½ cm on right leg front and middle\n\n              region.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">            6. Reddish abrasion 4 x ½ cm on left side of chest back on\n\n              scapular region.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL            NO. 426-DB OF 2001             -5-</span><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">             7.

Regarding other injuries, it was\n\nstated that these were simple in nature. Cause of death was shock and\n\nhemorrhage due to multiple injuries, which were ante mortem in nature and\n\nsufficient to cause death in ordinary course.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">              The Investigating Officer then went to the spot and recorded\n\nstatements of other witnesses. He also took into his possession tractor, left\n\nat the spot by the appellant - accused, against recovery memo. Scooter of\n\nthe deceased was also taken into possession in the same manner.            On\n\nNovember 9, 1998, Sukhwinder Singh and Surinder Singh, appellants -\n\naccused were arrested. Rajinder Singh, appellant - accused, was arrested on\n\nNovember 10, 1998. Beer Singh, appellant - accused in Criminal Appeal\n\n396-DB of 2001was arrested on November 11, 1998, and Balwinder Singh\n\nwas arrested on November 14, 1998. On interrogation, all the accused\n\nsuffered disclosure statements, which led to the recoveries of weapons of\n\noffence, i.e., wooden sticks, which were taken into possession against\n\nseizure memos. He also recorded supplementary statement of Harvinder\n\nSingh (PW1), wherein it was stated that injury on head of the deceased was\n\ncaused by Beer Singh alias Bira. On completion of investigation, final\n\nreport was put in Court for trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">             The appellants - accused were charge-sheeted, to which they\n\npleaded not guilty and claimed trial.           The prosecution produced 13\n\nwitnesses and also brought on record documentary evidence to prove its\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL           NO. 426-DB OF 2001            -6-</span>\n\ncase. On conclusion of prosecution evidence, statements of the appellants -\n\naccused were recorded under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. Incriminating material,\n\nexisting on record, was put to them.       They denied the same, claimed\n\ninnocence and pleaded false implication. They also led evidence in defence.\n\nThe trial Court, on appraisal of evidence, found the appellants - accused\n\nguilty for   the offence, with which they were charged and accordingly\n\nconvicted and sentenced them as mentioned in earlier part of this order.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">             Shri Vinod Ghai, Advocate, counsel for the appellants, has\n\nvehemently contended that the FIR was ante timed and further that the\n\nalleged eye witnesses, i.e., Harwinder Singh (PW1) and Makhan Singh\n\n(PW2) were not present at the spot when occurrence is alleged to have taken\n\nplace. By making reference to the sequence of events, he has also made an\n\nattempt to show that to cover the delay, story of injuries caused to Ranjit\n\nSingh (PW5) by the appellant - accused was concocted and to support that,\n\nmedical evidence was fabricated. By taking us through the statements made\n\nby PW1, PW2 and PW5 and also the Investigating Officer, he argued that\n\nthe conduct of the witnesses was most unnatural. Though available, they\n\nmade no attempt to save the deceased. Joginder Kaur PW , who was sitting\n\non scooter of the deceased, did not receive any injury. He further argued\n\nthat where dead body remained, from the time of registration of FIR till its\n\npost-mortem Examination is not coming out from the record. He further, by\n\nmaking reference to injury No. 4, tried to show that the deceased remained\n\nalive for three / four hours before death, which runs contrary to the version\n\nprojected by the prosecution. In the alternative, without conceding anything,\n\nhe argued that all male members of the family have been involved without\n\nany justification and further that the trial Court was not justified in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL           NO. 426-DB OF 2001              -7-</span>\n\nconvicting the appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 426-DB of 2001 with the\n\naid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 149</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">            Regarding appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 396-DB of 2001,\n\nhe argued that even his act would not fall within the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 302</a>\n\nIPC. He brought it to the notice of the Court that all the appellants had\n\nundergone more than 5 ½ years of actual sentence and at the maximum they\n\ncan be held liable for their own individual acts.       The prosecution has\n\nmiserably failed to show that common object of all the appellants was to\n\ncommit murder of the deceased. He prayed that the appeals be allowed,\n\njudgment and order under challenge be set aside and the appellants -\n\naccused be acquitted of the charges framed against him.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">            Prayer made by counsel for the appellants has vehemently been\n\nopposed by Shri D.S. Brar, Deputy Advocate General, Punjab, who , by\n\nmaking reference to the statements of the eye -witness Ranjit Singh (PW5)\n\nand the Investigating Officer tried to justify the judgment and order passed\n\nby the trial Court. He further argued that lodging of the FIR in this case was\n\nvery prompt, which had left no scope for any concoction by the prosecution.\n\nRegarding minor discrepancies here and there in the statements, made by\n\nthe eye-witnesses, he argued that benefit of the same can not go to the\n\nappellants - accused, once their guilt is proved on record. He further argued\n\nthat all the accused came together fully armed and way laid the deceased\n\nand caused injuries to him, which clearly shows that their common object\n\nwas to kill Kulwinder Singh deceased. By stating as above, he justified the\n\ninvoking of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 149</a> IPC by the trial Court, in the\n\ncase. He prayed that the appeals having no substance be dismissed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">            After hearing counsel for the parties, this Court is satisfied that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL           NO. 426-DB OF 2001              -8-</span>\n\nparticipation of the accused in the crime was proved on record. PW1\n\nHarvinder Singh has specifically stated that in the evening, a scuffle had\n\ntaken place between the parties, which resulted into receipt of brick bat\n\ninjuries by Ranjit Singh (PW5). Harvinder Singh, Makhan Singh, Joginder\n\nKaur etc. took Ranjit Singh (PW5) to Civil Hospital, Dera Baba Nanak, for\n\ntreatment, where he was medico legally examined by Dr. Satinder Singh\n\nBedi (PW11),on November 7, 1998, at 10.45 PM. He found the following\n\ninjuries on the person of Ranjit Singh:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">            &quot;1. A laceration about 1 cm x .25 cm lying transversely over the\n\n            left cheek just below the left eye. Blood clots along with fresh\n\n            bleeding was present in the wound.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">            2. A laceration of shape with each side about 1 cm x .25 cm\n\n               lying closed to injury No. 1 just near the left naso labial fold.\n\n               Blood clots along with fresh bleeding was present in the\n\n               wound.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">            3. A tender swelling in an area of about 4 cm x 3 cm\n\n               underneath both the above injuries was present over the left\n\n               cheek.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">Merely because, there is no proof that intimation was sent by the doctor to\n\nthe police, regarding receipt of injuries by Ranjit Singh is no ground to\n\ndiscard version of the prosecution. PW1 in his statement has specifically\n\nstated that they never intended to inform the fact of occurrence to the police.\n\nRather they were in favour of a compromise. Medical examination of Ranjit\n\nSingh was got conducted to use it, only if the opposite party may get any\n\nfalse case registered against them. It appears that the Doctor on their\n\nrequest had not sent intimation to the Police Station. At no stage, it has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL           NO. 426-DB OF 2001              -9-</span>\n\ncome on record that injuries to Ranjit Singh were self-suffered. Ranjit\n\nSingh (PW5) has also supported version of the prosecution regarding the\n\nincident which had taken place between the parties in the evening on\n\nNovember 7, 1998.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">              The statements made by PW1 and PW2 amply prove on record\n\nthat they along with Joginder Kaur etc. had taken Ranjit Singh (PW5) for\n\nmedical treatment to Civil Hospital, Dera Baba Nank. After his admission\n\nin the Hospital, they were going back to their village when they were way\n\nlaid by the appellants accused. The deceased was on a scooter along with\n\nJoginder Kaur PW. His scooter was stopped by the appellants by bringing\n\ntheir tractor in front of the same. Then the deceased was dragged to the\n\nnearby paddy fields. All the appellants - accused were armed with wooden\n\nsticks.   Both the witnesses have further stated that Rajinder Singh,\n\nappellant, gave a stick blow to Kulwinder Singh deceased at left side of his\n\nforehead. Sukhwinder Singh gave a stick blow to the deceased at right side\n\nof his forehead. Beer Singh accused gave a stick blow to Kulwinder Singh\n\nat his head. Balwinder Singh and Surinder Singh, appellants - accused,\n\ngave stick blows to the deceased at his right flank, back side of left shoulder\n\nand head. On raising alarm, all the appellants - accused fled away from the\n\nspot leaving behind their tractor. These witnesses have further stated that\n\nthey immediately shifted the deceased to the Civil Hospital. However, he\n\ncould not be saved. Matter was then reported to the police at 1.30 AM.\n\nIncident had occurred at 12.30 AM. FIR was concluded at 2.15 AM on\n\nNovember 8, 1998. Merely because the special report reached the Ilaqa\n\nMagistrate at 12.30 PM on that very date is no ground to say that FIR was\n\nante timed.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL           NO. 426-DB OF 2001             -10-</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">             As per statement made by Dr. Satinder Singh Bedi (PW11),\n\nRanjit Singh (PW5) was medico legally examined at 10.45 PM on\n\nNovember 7, 1998. After getting first aid to above named witness, it is\n\nexpected that the deceased and the others may have reached the place of\n\noccurrence by 12.30 AM on November 8, 1998. It has also come on record\n\nthat in the FIR, no specific injury was attributed to Beer Singh, appellant -\n\naccused in Criminal Appeal No. 396-DB of 2001. However, it has come on\n\nrecord that supplementary statement of PW1 was recorded by the\n\nInvestigating Officer, wherein specific injury was attributed to the above\n\nnamed appellant, at head of the deceased. It was night time. PW1, being a\n\nclose relative, may be nervous and may have failed to pin point injury given\n\nby Beer Singh, appellant, to the deceased. It is necessary to note that name\n\nof Beer Singh, appellant, was specifically mentioned in the FIR as one of\n\nthe assailants. Recovery of weapon of offence from the appellant - accused\n\nis fully proved on record. The defence version has rightly been discarded\n\nby the trial Court as it does not inspire any confidence.         Further the\n\ntestimony of the witnesses cannot be discarded merely because they failed\n\nto intervene when the appellants - accused were causing injuries to the\n\ndeceased. The witnesses were less in number. One out of them was a lady\n\nand they were unarmed. Occurrence had taken place in a very swift manner.\n\nIt appears that before the witnesses could muster courage/react, the\n\nassailants ran away from the spot by causing injuries to the deceased.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">            In view of above, it can safely be said that all the assailants had\n\nparticipated in the incident, which has resulted into death of Kulwinder\n\nSingh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">            Now it is to be seen whether all the appellants - accused had a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL           NO. 426-DB OF 2001            -11-</span>\n\ncommon object to kill the deceased or not? Whether they can be\n\nconstructively held liable for act done by Beer Singh, appellant, which\n\nresulted into causing death of the deceased?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"953390\" id=\"span_13\">It is necessary to note here that all other injuries except one\n\ncaused by Beer Singh were simple in nature. The circumstances, under\n\nwhich the the provision of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 149</a> I.P.C. can be made applicable to\n\nfasten criminal liability came up for consideration before the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/953390/\" id=\"a_9\">Siyaram and others v.

A plea which was emphasised by the (appellant)\n\n            relates to the question whether <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 149</a> IPC has any\n\n            application for fastening the constructive liability which is the\n\n            sine qua non for its operation. The emphasis is on the common\n\n            object and not on common intention. Mere presence in an\n\n            unlawful assembly cannot render a person liable unless there\n\n            was a common object and he was actuated by that common\n\n            object and that object is one of those set out in <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 141</a>.\n\n            Where common object of an unlawful assembly is not proved,\n\n            the accused persons cannot be convicted with the help of\n\n            <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 149</a>. The crucial question to determine is whether the\n\n            assembly consisted of five or more persons and whether the\n\n            said persons entertained one or more of the common objects, as\n\n            specified in <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 141</a>. It cannot be laid down as a general\n\n            proposition of law that unless an overt act is proved against a\n\n            person, who is alleged to be a member of an unlawful assembly,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL     NO. 426-DB OF 2001              -12-</span>\n\n       it cannot be said that he is a member of an assembly. The only\n\n       thing required is that he should have understood that the\n\n       assembly was unlawful and was likely to commit any of the\n\n       acts which fall within the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 141</a>. The word\n\n       &#x27;object&#x27; means the purpose or design and, in order to make it\n\n       &#x27;common&#x27;, it must be shared by all. In other words, the object\n\n       should be common to the persons who compose the assembly,\n\n       that is to say, they should all be aware of it and concur in it. A\n\n       common object may be formed by express agreement after\n\n       mutual consultation, but that is by no means necessary. It may\n\n       be formed at any stage by all or a few members of the assembly\n\n       and the other members may just join and adopt it.           Once\n\n       formed, it need not continue to be the same. It may be modified\n\n       or altered or abandoned at any stage. The expression &quot;in\n\n       prosecution of common object&#x27;, as appearing in <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 149</a>\n\n       has to be strictly construed as equivalent to &#x27;in order to attain\n\n       the common object&#x27;. It must be immediately connected with the\n\n       common object by virtue of the nature of the object. There must\n\n       be community of object and the object may exist only up to a\n\n       particular stage, and not thereafter. Members of an unlawful\n\n       assembly may have community of object up to a certain point\n\n       beyond which they may differ in their objects and the\n\n       knowledge, possessed by each member of what is likely to be\n\n       committed in prosecution of their common object, may vary not\n\n       only according to the information at his command, but also\n\n       according to the extent to which he shares the community of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL        NO. 426-DB OF 2001           -13-</span>\n\n       object, and as a consequence of this the effect of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 149</a>\n\n       IPC may be different on different members of the same\n\n       assembly.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">       13.&#x27;Common object&#x27; is different from a &#x27;common intention&#x27; as it\n\n         does not require a prior concert and a common meeting of\n\n         minds before the attack. It is enough if each has the same\n\n         object in view and their number is five or more and that they\n\n         act as an assembly to achieve that object. The &#x27;common\n\n         object&#x27; of an assembly is to be ascertained from the acts and\n\n         language of the members composing it, and from a\n\n         consideration of all the surrounding circumstances. It may be\n\n         gathered from the course of conduct adopted by the members\n\n         of the assembly. For determination of the common object of\n\n         the unlawful assembly, the conduct of each of the members\n\n         of the unlawful assembly, before and at the time of attack\n\n         and thereafter, the motive for the crime, are some of the\n\n         relevant considerations. What the common object of the\n\n         unlawful assembly is at a particular stage of the incident is\n\n         essentially a question of fact to be determined, keeping in\n\n         view the nature of the assembly, the arms carried by the\n\n         members, and the behaviour of the members at or near the\n\n         scene of the incident. It is not necessary under law that in all\n\n         cases of unlawful assembly, with an unlawful common\n\n         object, the same must be translated into action or be\n\n         successful.     Under the Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 141</a>, an\n\n         assembly which was not unlawful when it was assembled,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL     NO. 426-DB OF 2001             -14-</span>\n\n         may subsequently become unlawful. It is not necessary that\n\n         the intention or the purpose, which is necessary to render an\n\n         assembly an unlawful one comes into existence at the outset.\n\n         The time of forming an unlawful intent is not material. An\n\n         assembly which, at its commencement or even for some time\n\n         thereafter, is lawful, may subsequently become unlawful. In\n\n         other words, it can develop during the course of incident at\n\n         the spot eo instanti.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">       14.<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 149</a> IPC consists of two parts. The first part of the\n\n         section means that the offence to be committed in\n\n         prosecution of the common object must be one which is\n\n         committed with a view to accomplish the common object. In\n\n         order that the offence may fall within the first part, the\n\n         offence must be connected immediately with the common\n\n         object of the unlawful assembly of which the accused was a\n\n         member. Even if the offence committed is not in direct\n\n         prosecution of the common object of the assembly, it may yet\n\n         fall under <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 141</a>, if it can be held that the offence was\n\n         such as the members knew was likely to be committed and\n\n         this is what is required in the second part of the section. The\n\n         purpose for which the members of the assembly set out or\n\n         desired to achieve is the object. If the object desired by all\n\n         the members is the same, the knowledge that that is the\n\n         object which is being pursued is shared by all the members\n\n         and they are in general agreement as to how it is to be\n\n         achieved and that is now the common object of the assembly.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL     NO. 426-DB OF 2001            -15-</span>\n\n         An object is entertained in the human mind, and it being\n\n         merely a mental attitude, no direct evidence can be available\n\n         and, like intention, has generally to be gathered from the act\n\n         which the person commits and the result therefrom. Though\n\n         no hard and fast rule can be laid down under the\n\n         circumstances from which the common object can be culled\n\n         out, it may reasonably be collected from the nature of the\n\n         assembly, arms it carries and behaviour at or before or after\n\n         the scene of incident. The word &#x27;knew&#x27; used in the second\n\n         branch of the section implies something more than a\n\n         possibility and it cannot be made to bear the sense of &#x27;might\n\n         have been known.&#x27; Positive knowledge is necessary. When\n\n         an offence is committed in prosecution of the common\n\n         object, it would generally be an offence which the members\n\n         of the unlawful assembly knew was likely to be committed in\n\n         prosecution of the common object. That, however, does not\n\n         make the converse proposition true; there may be cases\n\n         which would come within the second part but not within the\n\n         first part. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"952560\" id=\"span_18\">The distinction between the two parts of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_20\">Section\n\n         149</a> cannot be ignored or obliterated. In every case it would\n\n         be an issue to be determined, whether the offence committed\n\n         falls within the first part or it was an offence such as the\n\n         members of the assembly knew to be likely to be committed\n\n         in prosecution of the common object and falls within the\n\n         second part. However, there may be cases which would be\n\n         within the first part but offences committed in prosecution of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\"> CRIMINAL APPEAL          NO. 426-DB OF 2001             -16-</span>\n\n              the common object would be generally, if not always, within\n\n              the second (part), namely, offences which the parties knew to\n\n              be likely to be committed in the prosecution of the common\n\n              object.
