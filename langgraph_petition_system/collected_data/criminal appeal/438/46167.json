This judgment will dispose of Criminal Appeal Nos.310 of\n\n2006 and 282 of 2006. They arise out of the following facts:\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.   Mohammad Mian, one of the appellants herein, was\n\nrunning a fair price shop in the outer portion of his house\n\nsituated in village Ferozpur, District Bareilly. At about 7 a.m.\n\non the 20th of April 1980 Iqrar Mohammad son of Firasat\n\nHusain PW-2 went to the fair price shop to buy sugar but\n\f                       Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                   2</span>\ninstead of supplying\n\n2 kgs. of sugar as per the ration card, Mohammad Mian gave\n\nonly 1 Kg.    Firasat Husain then went to Mohammad Mian&#x27;s\n\nshop and remonstrated with him and asked him as to why he\n\nhad supplied only half the quantity of sugar that was due on\n\nhis card.    Mohammad Mian, however, abused him and told\n\nhim that he would give only that quantity and he could take it\n\nor leave it as he wished.          Mohammad Mian immediately\n\nthereafter fired a shot at Firasat Husain with his gun hitting\n\nhim on his thigh and as he turned backwards Mohammad\n\nMian&#x27;s son, Zamir Mian, fired at him with a country made\n\npistol hitting him on the upper right gluteal region on which\n\nFirasat Husain fell down on the ground.              On hearing the\n\nsound of the firing, Riyasat Husain, father of Firasat Hussain\n\nwent out of his house and moved in that direction and on\n\nseeing his son lying injured, he questioned Mohammad Mian\n\nwhich resulted in a quarrel between them. Mohammad Mian\n\nthereupon asked his sons Ahmad Mian and Shamim Mian to\n\nkill Riyasat Husain on which Ahmed Mian picked up a gun\n\nand Shamim Mian a country made pistol and rushed to the\n\f                        Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                    3</span>\nroof of their house\n\nand as Riyasat Husain turned to move away, each of them\n\nfired a shot at him in quick succession on which he fell down.\n\nOn hearing the sound of the firing, Sharafat Husain, PW-1 too\n\nleft his house and proceeded towards the scene of occurrence.\n\nThe incident was also witnessed by Sabir Husain, Mohd.\n\nAslam, Rahat Husain and Summeri PW-3, who too were going\n\nto   the   shop   for   purchasing       sugar.        Sharafat   Husain\n\nimmediately went to his father who was lying in a precarious\n\ncondition and gasping for breath and removed him to his\n\nhouse but he succumbed to his injuries within a short time.\n\nFirasat Husain, the injured was also brought from the place\n\nwhere he lay.     Leaving his father&#x27;s dead body and his injured\n\nbrother in the family home, Sharafat Husain left for Police\n\nStation, Shahi at a distance of about 4 miles from village\n\nFerozpur and lodged the FIR at 9.10 a.m. It is the case of the\n\ndefence that the special report was delivered to the Magistrate\n\nthe next day i.e. the 25th April, 1980.               After receiving the\n\ninformation of the murder, Sub-Inspector Sri Nivas Sharma\n\nimmediately reached village Ferozpur and made the necessary\n\f                     Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                 4</span>\ninquiries and drew\n\nthe inquest report. He also dispatched the dead body for the\n\npost-mortem examination.       Firasat Husain was also sent to\n\nthe District Hospital for treatment.         The police officer also\n\nprepared the site plan and also collected blood stained earth\n\nfrom two places, one portion from the scene of occurrence and\n\nanother from the house of the deceased where the dead body\n\nhad been brought. Firasat Husain was medically examined by\n\nDr. J.N. Bhargava at the District Hospital, Bareilly at 12.25\n\np.m. on the 24th April, 1980 with two injuries, one being a gun\n\nshot wound entry and the other its exit.           Riyasat Husain&#x27;s\n\nbody was also subjected to a post-mortem examination at 2.30\n\np.m. on the 25th April, 1980, and nine injuries were found\n\nthereon, four gun shot wounds of entry and four of exit\n\nwhereas the 9th was an abrasion. On an internal examination\n\non the body, the humerus and a rib were found to be fractured\n\non account of the gun shot injury. On the completion of the\n\ninvestigation, the accused i.e. Mohammad Mian and his sons\n\nAhmad Mian, Shamim Mian and Zamir Mian were committed\n\nto the Court of Sessions for offences punishable under Section\n\f                       Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                   5</span>\n302 and 307 of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_1\">IPC</a> and as they pleaded not guilty, they were brought to trial.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.      The prosecution in support of its case, examined three\n\neye witnesses, Sharafat Husain PW-1, Firasat Husain PW-2\n\nand Summeri PW-3, Dr. J.N. Bhargava, PW-4 who had\n\nexamined Firasat Husain for his injuries, Dr. K.S. Tiwari, PW-\n\n5 who had conducted the autopsy on the dead body, PW-6\n\nSub-Inspector Srinivas Sharma the main investigating officer\n\nand PW-7 Head Constable Raghvendra Pal Singh who had\n\nrecorded the F.I.R. and dispatched the special report to the\n\nMagistrate. The accused denied the allegations leveled against\n\nthem and pleaded that they had been implicated in a false\n\ncase.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.      The trial court on a consideration of the evidence (and\n\nwhile believing most of the prosecution story) held that the\n\ncharge against the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_3\">34</a> could not\n\nbe made out as the medical evidence did not correspond to the\n\nocular version.    All the accused were acquitted of this charge.\n\nThe trial court, however, held Mohammad Mian guilty for the\n\f                         Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                     6</span>\noffence     punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 307</a> of the IPC for having caused the gun shot\n\ninjury on the person of Firasat Husain and sentenced him to 6\n\nyears R.I., but acquitted the other accused of that offence as\n\nwell.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.      Aggrieved by the judgment aforesaid, the State preferred\n\nan appeal assailing the acquittal of the accused whereas the\n\nMohammad Mian filed a separate appeal challenging his\n\nconviction and sentence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 307</a> of the IPC.            The\n\nHigh Court acutely conscious of the fact that it was largely\n\ndealing with an appeal against acquittal and the limitations\n\nthat went with it, re-appraised the evidence and observed that\n\nthe three eye witnesses, particularly the injured Firasat\n\nHusain, could not be disbelieved.                The Court noted that\n\nthough in the FIR Sharafat Husain had not stated that he had\n\nwitnessed the murder of his father, but the fact that the site\n\nplan had been prepared at his instance showing that he had\n\nwitnessed the occurrence from near the `baithak&#x27; of Chhotey\n\f                       Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                   7</span>\nPradhan,    he   was\n\nindeed an eye witness to the murder. The Court observed that\n\nthe distance between the house of the complainant party and\n\nthe accused was only 60 or 70 paces (which would make it\n\nabout 100 feet) and this short distance and the sequence of\n\nevents that preceded the firing made it clear that Sharafat\n\nHusain too had witnessed the incident. The Court also found\n\nthat after receiving the firearm injury, Firasat Husain had\n\nfallen at a distance of 10 feet from the fair price shop of\n\nMohammad Mian and he was, therefore, in an apparent\n\nposition to witness the fatal assault on his father. Likewise,\n\nthe Court observed that PW-3 Summeri was a trust worthy\n\nwitness as he too had seen the incident from the `baithak&#x27; of\n\nChhotey Pradhan after being attracted by the altercation\n\nbetween Firasat Husain and Mohammad Mian.            The Court\n\nfinally concluded that the eye witness account could not be\n\nfaulted in any manner. The High Court then dealt with the\n\nmedical evidence vis-a-vis the ocular evidence and observed\n\nthat as per the prosecution story the fatal shots had been fired\n\nat the deceased by Ahmad Mian and Shamim Mian from the\n\f                          Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                      8</span>\nroof   of   the   house\n\nwhich was about 10 feet in height. The Court observed that\n\nmerely because the wounds of entry and exit were either\n\nparallel to each other or in one case the exit wound was\n\nslightly higher than the wound of entry would not detract from\n\nthe other evidence as it could not be said with certainty as to\n\nthe posture which the deceased and the                  assailants were\napplying when the shots had been fired.                  The Court also\n\nobserved that the FIR had been lodged promptly and the\n\nspecial report also delivered within a reasonable time which\n\ntestified to the truthfulness of the prosecution story.                  The\n\nCourt, accordingly, set aside the order of the trial court\n\nacquitting Mohammad Mian, Ahmad Mian and Shamim Mian\n\nfor the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 302</a> read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 34</a> of the IPC and sentenced each of them to\n\nimprisonment      for   life.      The     Criminal     Appeal   filed    by\n\nMohammad Mian challenging his conviction under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_8\">Section\n\n307</a> was also dismissed. It was also directed that the sentence\n\nof the accused were to run concurrently.                The two appeals\n\f                       Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                   9</span>\nmentioned      above\n\nhave been filed impugning the judgment of the High Court.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">6.   Mr. Ranjit Kumar, the learned senior counsel for the\n\nappellants, has raised several arguments during the course of\n\nhearing. He has pointed out that the High Court had ignored\n\nthe basic fact that it was dealing with an appeal against\n\nacquittal in so far as the charge of murder was concerned and\n\nit could not be said that the judgment of the Trial Court was\n\nso perverse or against the evidence that interference was\n\ncalled for. He has further pleaded that the FIR had not been\n\nlodged at its purported time but infact much later and then\n\nante-timed in the light of the fact that the special report, as\n\nper the FIR itself, had been dispatched to the Magistrate on\n\nthe 25th of April, 1980 i.e. a day after the incident. He has,\n\naccordingly, pleaded that this delay had been utilized by the\n\nprosecution to involve the entire family of Mohammad Mian in\n\na false case, though the circumstances showed that neither\n\nPW-1 nor PW-3 had been present at the spot. It has also been\n\nemphasized that the medical evidence did not conform to the\n\f                        Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                    10</span>\nocular      testimony\n\nleading to the conclusion that the incident had not happened\n\nin the manner suggested by the prosecution.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">7.   Mr.   Pramod    Swarup,         the     learned   senior   counsel\n\nrepresenting the State of Uttar Pradesh, has, however,\n\ncontroverted these submissions and has pointed out that the\n\ndistance between the house of the deceased and the shop and\n\nhouse of the accused was only 70 paces or 100 feet and on\n\naccount of this very short distance and the time of the incident\n\nbeing 7 a.m., the presence of the eye witnesses at home was to\n\nbe expected.   It has also been pleaded that the presence of\n\nFirasat Hussain who had been grievously injured with a\n\nfirearm could not, in any case, be disbelieved and in the light\n\nof this fact even assuming there was some discrepancy in the\n\nmedical evidence vis-`-vis the ocular one, the same could be\n\nignored.   It has, further, been submitted that there was no\n\ndelay in the lodging of the FIR or the delivery of the special\n\nreport in the light of the statement of Head Constable\n\nRaghvendra Prasad Singh PW-7 who had deposed that the\n\nspecial report had been dispatched to the Magistrate within a\n\f                        Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                    11</span>\nvery short time, with\n\nthe result that there was no time to cook up a false story.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">8.   We have considered the arguments advanced by the\n\nlearned counsel for the parties. It will be noticed that the trial\n\ncourt had given findings in favour of the prosecution on\n\nvirtually all aspects, but had ultimately acquitted the accused\n\nof the charge of murder almost exclusively on the ground that\n\nthe medical evidence did not conform to or support the ocular\n\nversion. The High Court has, merely, reversed this aspect of\n\nthe trial court judgment and held that a case of murder was\n\nalso made out against three of the accused, that is the present\n\nappellants.   It is in this background that the entire matter\n\nwould have to be examined by us.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">9.   Undoubtedly, the prompt lodging of the FIR is a very\n\nsignificant factor in any criminal prosecution.        There are\n\nseveral parameters by which the spontaneity of a F.I.R. and\n\nthe prosecution&#x27;s story as to the time at which it had been\n\nlodged has to be adjudged, and one of the primary factors is\n\nthe time of the delivery of the special report to the Magistrate,\n\f                         Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                     12</span>\nas it is expected that\n\nhe being unconnected in any manner with the investigation or\n\nthe prosecution would be an independent person to endorse as\n\nto the time that a copy of the FIR had been received by him. It\n\nhas come in the evidence that the incident had happened in\n\nvillage Ferozpur at 7 a.m. on the 24th April of 1980. The FIR\n\n(purportedly) had been lodged at Police Station, Shahi, about 4\n\nkm. away at 9.10 a.m. and as per the column in the statutory\n\nform dealing with F.I.R&#x27;s, the copy of the special report had\n\nbeen dispatched from the Police Station on the 25th April, 1980\n\nto the Magistrate at Bareilly at a distance of 39 Kms..\n\nUndoubtedly, this date, if accurate, would arouse great\n\nsuspicion about the time that the FIR had been lodged and\n\nipso facto some suspicion about the prosecution story as well.\n\nWe have, however, gone through the evidence of PW-7 Head\n\nConstable Raghvendra Prasad Singh.                     This police official\n\ncategorically stated that the copy of the special report had\n\nbeen dispatched from the Police Station on the 24th April, 1980\n\nthrough Constable Mahesh and the said Constable had\n\nreturned to the police station at 9:15 p.m. on the same day\n\f                       Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                   13</span>\nafter delivering the\n\nspecial report and that both the departure and arrival reports\n\nhad been recorded in the daily diary of the Police Station. Mr.\n\nRanjit Kumar has, however, emphasized that the statement of\n\nPW-7 was at variance with the entry made in the FIR, (as\n\nnoted above) and as such was an after thought. It is extremely\n\nsignificant, however, that PW-7 was not even remotely cross-\n\nexamined on the apparent confusion in the time factor with\n\nregard to the special report. We are, therefore, of the opinion\n\nthat no advantage can be taken by the defence on account of\n\nthis discordance, if any. We must therefore take it as proved\n\nthat the incident had indeed happened at 7 a.m., the FIR had\n\nbeen recorded at 9.10 a.m. and the special report had been\n\ndelivered to the Magistrate the same day.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">10.   We now examine the other evidence in the above\n\nbackground.   It bears notice that PW-2 Firasat Husain was\n\ngravely injured in the incident.            His presence, therefore,\n\ncannot be doubted.        We have gone through the medical\n\nevidence with respect to his injuries and find five gun shot\n\f                     Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                 14</span>\nwounds of entry on\n\nthe spine with a corresponding wound of exit over the right\n\nbuttock. The doctor had examined Firasat at 12.25 p.m. on\n\nthe 24th April, 1980 and opined that the injuries could have\n\nbeen suffered within six hours.       This corresponds fully with\n\nthe prosecution story. It is this injury which has led to the\n\nconviction of Mohammad Mian under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 307</a> of the IPC.\n\nWe also see that the presence of PW-1 Sharafat Husain, the\n\nauthor of the FIR, can also not be doubted. It is true that in\n\nthe FIR recorded at his instance, he does not specifically\n\nallude to his presence at the spot.          A perusal of the FIR,\n\nhowever, reveals that read as a whole, it makes out that he\n\nwas indeed an eye witness. We have examined the evidence of\n\nPW-6 Shri Nivas Sharma, one of the investigating officers, who\n\nhad prepared the site plan and had also carried out the\n\npreliminary investigations at the site.            He deposed in his\n\nexamination-in-chief that he had also recorded the statement\n\nof Sharafat Husain at the spot and had prepared the site plan\n\non his instructions and had also shown (in the site plan) the\n\nplace from where he had seen the incident.                 When the\n\f                        Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                    15</span>\nstatement   of   this\n\nwitness is read in the background of the site plan, it is clear\n\nthat Sharafat Husain was indeed present at the crucial time.\n\nMr. Ranjit Kumar has also drawn our attention to the evidence\n\nof Summeri PW-3, the third eye witness, who is said to be a\n\ntotally independent one.        He has referred us to his cross-\n\nexamination where he says that he had not made any\n\nstatement to the Darogaji under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 161</a> of the Cr.P.C. To\n\nour mind, this appears to be an attempt to help the defence as\n\nthe Darogaji referred to i.e. PW-6 categorically stated that he\n\nhad recorded his statement on the date of the murder.        We\n\nalso see from the site plan that the presence of PW-3 also\n\nfigures as having seen the murder from outside the house of\n\nChhotey Pradhan, a very short distance away. To our mind,\n\ntherefore, the presence of this witness can also not be\n\ndoubted. Concededly, PW-6 did not record the statement of\n\nany of the persons of the immediate neighbourhood.           He\n\nadmitted to this fact in his cross-examination.       We cannot,\n\nhowever, ignore the sad but basic truth that so-called\n\nindependent witnesses tend to stay far away and are not\n\f                        Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                    16</span>\nwilling to come forth\n\nas they often face grave consequences. The prosecution has\n\ntherefore, perforce, to fall back on the testimonies of witnesses\n\nwho are friends or family members of the victim.                    In the\n\npresent case, we find that the house of the complainants was\n\nonly 100 feet from the house of accused and the incident\n\nhappened about 10 feet away from the house of the accused.\n\nAs already mentioned above, the presence of all the witnesses\n\nwas, therefore, natural at the time when the incident\n\nhappened and that in any case Firasat Husain was a stamped\n\nwitness, against whom no suspicion could be raised.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">11.   We have also gone through the depositions of the three\n\neye-witnesses. They have categorically stated that there was\n\nenmity between the parties since long.                It appears that the\n\ndispute   with   regard     to   the     1   Kg.      sugar   had   merely\n\nprecipitated the festering animosity. All the witnesses have\n\nstated as to the manner in which first Mohammad Mian had\n\nshot Firasat Husain and when his father had come forward to\n\nsee what had happened, he had been shot dead by the other\n\f                         Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                     17</span>\ntwo   accused     from\n\nthe roof of their residential house. The learned counsel for the\n\nappellants has, however, referred us to some inconsistencies\n\ninter se the statements of these three witnesses. To our mind,\n\nthey are so insignificant that they call for no serious\n\ndiscussion as they are bound to appear in the statement of\n\nany witness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">12.   The trial court had acquitted the accused of the charge of\n\nmurder primarily on the ground that the medical evidence did\n\nnot support the ocular version of the incident. To our mind,\n\nthe reasons given by the trial court were not well considered.\n\nIt has been observed by the Trial Court thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             &quot;Moreover, the medical evidence also does not\n      fit in the prosecution story in this case even if it is\n      presumed although reluctantly that the fatal shots\n      were fired from the roof top by the accused Ahmad\n      Mian and Shamin Mian.             According to Dr.\n      K.S.Tiwari who conducted the post mortem\n      examination of the deady body of Riasat Husain\n      there were four gun shot wounds of entry on the\n      back of chest of the deceased which are injuries\n      no.1 to 4 in the post mortem examination report\n      Ex. Ka-3. Their corresponding wounds of exit are\n      injuries no.5,6,7 and 8 respectively. According to\n      PW5 Dr. K.S. Tiwari the exit wounds of injury No.1\n      is slightly higher than the wound of entry. This\n      particular injury cannot be caused from roof top.</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n\f                Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                            18</span>\nThe       witness\nPW.1 Sharafat\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">Husain stated that the height of the roof from\nwhere the fatal shots were fired is about 10&#x27; and\nthere is also a Mundair thereon about 1 =&#x27; or 2&#x27;\nhigh. This witness also stated that the deceased\nRiasat Husain was at a distance of 6 or 7 stops\nfrom the door of the shop from the roof of which\nthe accused Shamim Mian and Ahmad Mian fired\nthe shots. This topography makes it certain that\ninjury No.1 corresponding to its wound of exit\ninjury no.5 cannot be caused from the roof top.\nThe witness PW5 Dr. K.S.Tiwari further stated that\ninjury No.2 and injury No.4 have their exit wound\nat the same level. This witness further says that\nthe exit wound of injury No.3 is slightly on a lower\nplan. Thus the position of the wounds of entry and\nexit is such that it is difficult to believe that the\nfiring in which Riasat Husain (illegible)was caused\nfrom the roof top as alleged by the prosecution. It\nappears that the firing actually took place from the\nshop itself and the two accused Ahmad Mian and\nShamim Mian were elevated to the roof top simply\nto be seen by the witnesses from point `F&#x27; and in\nthis process the prosecution evidence lost its\ncredibility and led the court only to a confusion\nwhich was aggravated all the more by the contents\nof the FIR Ex.Ka01. It became and doubtful under\nthese circumstances to ascertain which of the two\nsets of accused fired the fatal shot. The court\ncannot presume that it were the accused\nMohammad Mian and Zamir Mian standing at the\nshop fired the fatal shots because they are not\nstated by the witnesses to have fired any shot at\nRiasat Husain deceased. The other set of the two\naccused Ahmad Mian and Shamim Mian are\nunautmously alleged to be at the roof top and first\nalleged to have fired at Riasat Husain at his chest\nand then at his back but by medical evidence it is\n\f                       Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                   19</span>\n      not    probable\n      that the fatal\n      shots were at all fired from the roof top.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">13.   To our mind, these observations are meaningless in the\n\nlight of the ocular evidence when read in the context of\n\nincident as it happened.

The doctor opined that the exit of injury No.1 was at a\n\nmarginally higher level than the wound of entry, that the exit\n\nand entry wounds of injury No.2 were at the same level\n\nwhereas the exit wound of Injury No.3 and 4 were at a slightly\n\nlower level than the wounds of entry. The doctor also opined\n\nthat there were fractures of the left humerus bone, the 5th rib\n\non the right side and the 7th costal cartilage. We must observe\n\nthat   country   made    weapons       had     been   used   and   the\n\nperformance of these weapons being unpredictable and\n\nuncertain, the trajectory of the bullet alone would not be a\n\nsafe basis for assessing the entire evidence more particularly\n\f                         Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                     21</span>\nas   the   projectiles\n\ncould have been deflected from their true path by the bones or\n\ntissues that came along the way. This is what Dr. Modi has to\n\nsay in Modi&#x27;s Medical Jurisprudence and Toxicology, Twenty-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">third Edition at page 724:                             Direction\n\nfrom which the Weapon was fired.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">            &quot;The question regarding the direction of fire,\n     whether from right to left or from front to back is\n     of medico-legal importance. To ascertain this, it\n     is necessary to know the position of the victim at\n     the time of the discharge of the bullet, when a\n     straight line drawn between the entrance and exit\n     wounds and prolonged in front generally\n     indicates the line of direction. In some cases, it\n     is difficult to determine the direction as the bullet\n     is so often deflected by the tissues that its course\n     is very irregular, also when the bullet wobbles.&quot;\n\n\n There is yet another circumstance which is extremely\n\nrelevant. It is the case of the prosecution that the gun shots\n\nhad been fired from the roof of the house of Mohammad Mian\n\nwhich was 10 or 12 feet high. It has come in the statements of\n\nSharafat Husain and Firasat Husain that the firing was from a\n\ndistance of 10 to 12 steps which would mean 15 feet. This\n\nclearly corresponds to the nature of the injuries found on the\n\f                       Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                   22</span>\ndead body. The trial\n\ncourt seems to have been greatly influenced by the fact that\n\nthe prosecution story that the shots had been fired from the\n\nroof was deliberately created by the prosecution as otherwise\n\nMohammad Mian&#x27;s house would not have been in their direct\n\nline of sight. We have, however, considered this aspect in the\n\nlight of the statement of PW-1. He candidly admitted that the\n\nshop of Mohammad Mian was not visible from their house as\n\nthere was a mosque in between but after 10 feet or so beyond\n\nthe grave located near the gate, the shop of the accused could\n\nbe seen. In this situation, we find that the normal tendency of\n\na witness who had heard the sound of repeated gun shots\n\nclose to his house would be to move in that direction. This is\n\nwhat Sharafat Husain apparently did as after hearing the\n\nsound of the first shot fired at Firasat Husain, both the\n\ndeceased and Sharafat had been attracted towards that way\n\nleading to the murder. We also see from the site plan which\n\nhad been prepared contemporaneously that the gun shots had\n\nbeen fired on the deceased from the roof of the house.     The\n\nfinding of the trial court, therefore, that the prosecution had\n\f                       Crl.Appeal No.310/2006 etc.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                   23</span>\nchanged the location\n\nof the two accused to bring them on the roof, was speculative.\n\nWe are, therefore, of the opinion that no fault can be found\n\nwith the judgment of the High Court.                   The appeals are,\n\naccordingly, dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">                                            ...................................J.\n                                               (HARJIT SINGH BEDI)\n\n\n\n\n                                       ...................................J.\n                                  (CHANDRAMAULI KR.
