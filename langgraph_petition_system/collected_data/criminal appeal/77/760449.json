The High Court, accordingly, held \n\n\n\nthat the finding of the trial court was perverse on this \n\n\n\naspect.   The  trial court then went on to circumstance \n\n\n\nNo.9   and   evolved   its   own   theories   and   after   a   huge \n\n\n\ndiscussion,   rejected   the   DNA   report   given   by   the \n\n\n\nCCMB,   Hyderabad   as   also   the   evidence   of   Dr.   Lalji \n\n\n\nSingh   and   Dr.   G.V.

The \n\n\n\nHigh Court held that it would be a dangerous doctrine \n\n\n\nfor   the   court   to   discard   the   evidence   of   an   expert \n\n\n\nwitness by referring to certain texts and books without \n\n\f\n                          Crl.

The   trial   court   and   the   High   Court \n\n\n\nboth   held   circumstance   No.11   in   favour   of   the \n\n\n\nprosecution and it was observed that the deceased was \n\n\n\nalone   at   the   time   of   incident   and   that   she   had   been \n\n\n\nbrutally   attacked   with   the   helmet   which   had   been \n\n\n\nused with great force to cause as many as 19 injuries, \n\n\n\nincluding three broken ribs.

The   trial   court   also   held   that \n\n\n\nInspector   Lalit   Mohan,   the   first   investigating   officer \n\n\n\nand a member of the Delhi Police had done no credit to \n\n\n\nhimself   but   lauded   the   Commissioner   of   Police,   Delhi \n\n\n\nfor   suggesting   that   the   matter   be   handed   over   to   the \n\n\n\nCBI,   to   obviate   any   suspicion   of   an   unfair \n\n\n\ninvestigation.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">10.

We   now   examine   the   evidence   on   these   two \n\n\ncircumstances.     As   already   mentioned   above,   the \n\n\n\nmedical   report   dated   24th  January   1996   recorded   by \n\n\n\nDr.   Wadhwa  refers to  a  swelling  on  the  right  hand  at \n\n\n\nthe  5th  metacarpal.   In the very next line in  the same \n\n\n\nreport   there   is   a   reference   to   a   scar   mark   old   healed \n\n\n\nmultiple lower ribs.   It is apparent therefore, that the \n\n\n\nDoctor himself noticed that the scar mark was an old \n\n\n\nand   healed   injury,   whereas   the   swelling   on   the   right \n\n\n\nhand   revealed   tenderness   and   presence   of   the \n\n\n\ncrepitus.   When this Doctor came into the witness box \n\n\n\nas   PW23,   an   attempt   was   made   to   show   that   the \n\n\n\ncondition of the injury  indicated that it was about 10 \n\n\n\nor   15   days   old.     This   plea   was   specifically   denied   by \n\n\n\nthe   Doctor.     Dr.   Mukul   Sinha   was,   however,   more \n\n\n\ncategoric when he stated that the presence of swelling \n\n\f\n                         Crl.

Dr.   G.K.Chobe \n\n\n\nwas   still   more   emphatic.     After   reviewing   the   medical \n\n\n\nreport  dated 24th  January 1996 he put the maximum \n\n\n\nduration   of   the   injury   between   48   to   72   hours   and \n\n\n\nfurther   deposed   that   a   fracture   of   the   5th  metacarpal \n\n\n\nwas   generally   produced   by   direct   violence,   the   most \n\n\n\ncommon factor being  the striking of  the hand against \n\n\n\nan   opponent   during   an   altercation.     He   further \n\n\n\nclarified that in the case of a fracture of the metacarpal \n\n\n\nthe   swelling   would   not   remain   for   more   than   3   to   4 \n\n\n\ndays and that the callus formation had not yet started \n\n\f\n                         Crl.

Dr.   Chobe   also   made   another \n\n\n\nsignificant   statement.   He   pointed   out   that   had   the \n\n\n\nincident   happened  on   14th  January   1996   a   plaster   or \n\n\n\nbandage   would   have   been  applied   to   the   fracture   but \n\n\n\nthere   was   no   indication   as   to   whether   this   line   of \n\n\n\ntreatment   had   been   adopted.

In addition to this, we \n\n\n\nfind that the appellant had made a complaint against \n\n\n\nthe deceased to the University authorities and followed \n\n\n\nit   up   with   a   reminder   that   she   was   pursuing   two \n\n\n\ncourses in the University at the same time which was \n\n\n\nagainst   the   rules   with   the   result   the   University   had \n\n\n\nissued a show cause notice to her and that the matter \n\n\n\nwas   still   under   enquiry   with   the   University   when   the \n\n\n\npresent   incident   happened.

It   has   come   in \n\n\n\nthe   evidence   of   PW   Smt.

On   the   contrary   if   the   trial   court&#x27;s \n\n\n\njudgment   was   perverse,   meaning   thereby   that   it   was \n\n\n\nnot   only   against   the   weight   of   evidence   but   was   all \n\n\n\ntogether   against   the   evidence,   interference   was   called \n\n\n\nfor.  The High Court was alive to its limitation in such \n\n\n\na   matter   and   while   dealing   with   this   argument   first \n\n\n\nexpressed its shock and observed that though virtually \n\n\n\nall  the   findings   were in  favour  of  the   prosecution,   yet \n\n\n\ncuriously, the decision had been rendered in favour of \n\n\n\nthe   accused.

There   is \n\nabsolutely   no   doubt   in   our   mind   that \n\nwhat   was   required   of   Santosh   Singh   was \n\nexemplary   behaviour   being   a   son   of   a \n\npolice officer and also a lawyer himself yet \n\nwith   a   premeditated   approach   he \n\ncontinued   to   harass   the   victim   for   nearly \n\ntwo   years   and   ultimately   in   spite   of \n\nrepeated   warnings   by   the   police   and   his \n\nundertakings   to   them   went   about \n\ncommitting   a   most   ghastly   act.   The   act \n\nitself   sent   ripples   in   the   society   and \n\nshowed   how   insecure   a   citizen   can   get \n\nagainst   this   kind   of   a   person.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1201493\" id=\"span_112\">In   the \n\nvarious   judgments   which   have   been \n\nreferred to by counsel from both sides we \n\nfind   the   principles   laid   down   to   the \n\nconsidered  while   deciding  the   question   of \n\nsentence   are   best   reported   in   <a href=\"/doc/1201493/\" id=\"a_33\">`Bachan \n\nSingh   vs.   State   of   Punjab</a>&#x27;   AIR   1980   SC \n\n898   and   `Machhi   Singh   vs.   State   of \n\nPunjab,   1983   SC   211.     These   cases   sum \n\nup the law on the subject of death penalty \n\nwhich   we   have   kept   in   mind.   Evaluating \n\nthe   circumstances   in   favour   and   against \n\nthe   convict   which   have   already   been \n\nenumerated   above,   we   find   that   the \n\naggravating   circumstances   referred   to   by \n\n\f\n                         Crl.

We are thus \n\n     of the opinion that for a crime of this sort \n\n     which   has   been   committed   with \n\n     premeditation and in a brutal manner the \n\n     convict   deserves   no   other   sentence   but \n\n     death.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">     The underlined words themselves give a hint as to \n\n\n\nthe   sentence   that   should   be   awarded   in   this   case. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_97\">Undoubtedly the sentencing part is a difficult one and \n\n\n\noften   exercises   the   mind   of   the   Court   but   where   the \n\n\n\noption is between a life sentence and a death sentence, \n\n\n\nthe   options   are   indeed   extremely   limited   and   if   the \n\n\n\ncourt itself feels some difficulty in awarding one or the \n\n\n\nother,   it   is   only   appropriate   that   the   lesser   sentence \n\n\n\nshould be awarded.  This is the underlying philosophy \n\n\n\nbehind `the rarest of the rare&#x27; principle.   Furthermore, \n\n\n\nwe   see   that   the   mitigating   circumstances   need   to   be \n\n\f\n                            Crl.

Undoubtedly,   also   the   appellant   would   have \n\n\n\nhad time for reflection over the events of the last fifteen \n\n\n\nyears, and to ponder over the predicament that he now \n\n\n\nfaces,   the   reality   that   his   father   died   a   year   after   his \n\n\n\nconviction and the prospect of a dismal future for his \n\n\n\nyoung   family.     On   the   contrary,   there   is   nothing   to \n\n\n\nsuggest that he would not be capable of reform.  There \n\n\n\nare   extremely   aggravating   circumstances   as   well.     In \n\n\n\nparticular we notice the tendency of parents to be over \n\n\n\nindulgent to their progeny  often resulting in the most \n\n\n\nhorrendous   of   situations.               These   situations   are \n\n\n\nexacerbated   when   an   accused   belongs   to   a   category \n\n\f\n                         Crl.
