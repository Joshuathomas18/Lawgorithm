There are six accused in this case.  They are:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">1. Mahendra Mishra (no bail granted);\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">2 &amp; 3. Rajendra Mishra and Jitendra Mishra (bail granted);\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">4. Digambar Mishra (bail granted);\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">5 &amp; 6. Nagendra Mishra &amp; Gopal Mishra (absconding/not on trial).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">All the above accused persons have been charged for being members of an \nunlawful assembly and committing murder of Sunil Kumar Mishra and Chandra Shekhar \nMishra and attempt to commit murder of Manoj Kumar Mishra, Anil Kumar Mishra and \nPanchanan Mishra.  The accused were armed with the guns and they surrounded the \nbrothers and the complainant/appellant.  Digambar Mishra fired from his licensed gun at \nSunil Kumar Mishra who fell down.  Mahendra Mishra fired at Chandra Shekhar Mishra \nwho also fell down.  Gopal Mishra fired three shots from his country made pistol on the \ncomplainant/appellant and the complainant managed to run towards his house raising \nan alarm.  The complainant brought the two injured sons on a thela to Sardar Hospital, \nMunger but they died before any medical help could be given to them and they were \ndeclared dead.  One of the deceased was an advocate, another was lecturer and one \nwas appointed auditor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">The motive of the murder was on account of the occurrence which took place \nthat the complainant/appellant had sold a land to Ramachandra Yadav and the accused \npersons felt annoyed at it and tried to grab those lands on the strength of their muscle \npower and there is also a litigation pending between the parties.  Anil Mishra was also \ninjured.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">The accused Digambar Mishra, Rajendra Mishra, Jitendra Mishra and Mahendra \nMishra were sent for trial and two accused, namely, Gopal Mishra andNagendra Mishra \nwere shown as absconded and did not turn up during the whole trial.  The proceedings \nin respect of accused Nagendra Mishra and Gopal Mishra were separated vide order \ndated 20.11.2002 and the case of the rest of the accused was committed to the court of \nSessions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">The prosecution examined four eye witnesses PW-1, PW-2, PW-4 and PW-5, \nwho is an independent witness and whose house is adjacent to the house of the \ncomplainant.  During the trial, it was established that PW-1,2,4 and 5 are the natural \nand probable witnesses and their testimony was amply corroborated with each other.  \nThe identity of the accused persons during the cross examination was also established.  \nThere is no dispute with reference to the place of occurrence, the time of occurrence \nand the manner of occurrence.  The direct evidence of the eye witnesses was \ncorroborated by the medical evidence and the motive of the crime was also established.  \nThe presence of the eye witnesses was also established at the time of occurrence.  It \nwas also proved that there was a Satya Narayan Puja at the house of the complainant \nbefore the occurrence.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">The trial Court, on the basis of the evidence available, came to the conclusion \nthat there is satisfactory evidence that Digambar Mishra instigated to commit the \nmurder and at that point of time the common intention was developed and in pursuance \nof that common intention of the accused they fired at two deceased.  They had also \ncommon intention to murder other persons available there and they fired on the \ncomplainant PW-2 and PW-1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">The trial Court convicted and sentenced the accused Mahendra Mishra, \nRajendra Mishra and Jitendra Mishra for the offence under Sections 148, 302 read with \n34, 307 read with 34 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_1\">I.P.C</a>. and <a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 27</a> of the Arms Act.  The accused Digambar \nMishra was convicted and sentenced under Section 109 read with Section 302 and \nunder Section 307 I.P.C. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">The criminal appeals were filed by the accused before the High Court.  The High \nCourt ordered the release of Digambar Mishra on bail in Criminal Appeal No. 50 of 2004 \nvide order dated 23.01.2004 and the other two accused, namely, Rajendra Mishra and \nJitendra Mishra vide impugned order dated 30.01.2004 in Criminal Appeal No. 62 of \n2004. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">The non-speaking order passed by the High Court in Criminal Appeal No. 50 of \n2004 and 62 of 2004 reads thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">&quot;In Criminal Appeal No.50 of 2004\n\nIssue notice and call for the lower court records.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">On the point of Ba-1, counsel submits that the appellant has been \nconvicted under Sections 302 and 307 with the aid of Section 109 of the \nPenal Code.  The prayer for bail is opposed on behalf of the informant, who \nhas appeared on his own.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">In the facts and circumstances, during pendency of this appeal, the \nappellant(Digambar Mishra) shall be released on bail on furnishing bond of \nRs.10,000/- (ten thousand) with two sureties of the like amount each to the \nsatisfaction of the trial Court  i.e., 3rd Addl. Sessions Judge, Munger in \nSessions Trial No. 730 of 2002.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">The realization of fine shall also remain stayed till disposal of the \nappeal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">In Criminal Appeal No.62  of 2004\n\nIssue notice and call for the records.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">On the point of bail, counsel submits that the appellants are not \nassailants of the deceased.  The prayer is opposed on behalf of the \ninformant who has appeared on his own, and submits that from the \nevidence of PW-1 it will appear that these appellants had assaulted him.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">In the facts and circumstances, during pendency of this appeal \nappellants namely Rajendra Mishra and Jitendra Mishra are ordered to be \nreleased on bail on their furnishing bail bonds of Rs.10,000/- with two \nsureties of the like amount each to the satisfaction of the trial Court i.e. 3rd \nAddl. Sessions Judge, Munger in Sessions Trial No. 730/2002.&quot;\n</blockquote>  \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">A reading of the above non-speaking order would only show the total non-\napplication of mind by the Court to the gravity of the crime, the apprehension of \ntampering with the evidence and threats to the life of the complainant and other \nwitnesses given by the accused.  The High Court passed the impugned order in a \nmechanical fashion without proper application of mind and without going into the merits \nand evidence on record against the accused persons.  The High Court failed to see and \nappreciate that the respondents herein who are the main accused Nos. 1 to 3 are the \nmaster minds behind the crime committed.  The High Court has not considered the \nmaterial evidence available on record against the accused which prima facie establish \nthe criminal liability of the respondents.  The High Court also failed to see that the \nlearned Sessions Judge, after taking into consideration, the seriousness and the gravity \nof the crime convicted the accused for the crime.  This apart, three other vital factors \nhave also been not taken note of by the High Court.  They are the evidence of PW-1,2,4 \nand 5 who are the eye witnesses and whose testimony was amply corroborated with \neach other.  Secondly, the identity of the accused persons during the cross examination \nwas also established.  Thirdly, the direct evidence of the eye witnesses was \ncorroborated by the medical evidence and the motive of the crime was also established.  \nThe trial Court has held that there is satisfactory evidence that Digambar Mishra \ninstigated to commit the murder and at that point of time and in pursuance of that \ncommon intention of the accused they fired at the two accused.  The High Court also \nhas not taken into account the several complaints and information reports before the \ntrial and to the Police Authorities stating that the accused have killed his two sons out of \nsix, the three accused were arrested and remanded to jail and other accused are \nabsconding and evading their arrest and that one of the accused Digambar Mishra who \nis on bail has confirmed the group of criminals and comes to the house of the appellant \nand gives threatening to the eye witnesses of the said order in order to pressurize them \nnot to pursue the criminal case against them and that whenever these accused persons \nvisit the house of the appellant, they are always armed with their guns. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">The learned counsel for the respondent submitted that respondent No.1 had \nalready undergone 12 months of sentence, respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in Special Leave \nPetition No. 3316 of 2004 had already undergone 22 months of sentence approximately \neach and that the respondents have a meritorious case in criminal appeal and \naccordingly, the High Court while admitting the appeal have released the respondents \non bail subject to certain conditions.  It is further submitted that subsequent to the grant \nof bail order, there is no instance on record that the respondents have misused their \nrelease on bail and, therefore, there is no question of the respondents either trying to \ninterfere with the course of justice or the attempt to tamper with the evidence or \nwitnesses or to threaten or indulge in similar activities which would hamper the smooth \ninvestigation of trial.  He would further submit that annexure P2, an information petition \nNo. 872 (J) of 2004 under <a href=\"/doc/1445515/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 39</a> of the Cr.P.C. made by the appellant to the court \nof CJM, Munger cannot be pressed into service and be made a ground for cancellation \nof bail granted by the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">We have given our careful consideration on the rival submissions made by the \ncounsel appearing on either side.  The object underlying the cancellation of bail is to \nprotect the fair trial and secure justice being done to the society by preventing the \naccused who is set at liberty by the bail order from tampering with the evidence in \nheinous crime and if there is delay in such a case the underlying object of cancellation \nof bail practically loses all its purpose and significance to the greatest prejudice and the \ninterest of the prosecution.  It hardly requires to be stated that once a person released \non bail in serious criminal cases where the punishment is quite stringent and deterrent \nthe accused in order to get away from the clutches of the same indulge in various \nactivities like tampering with the prosecution witnesses threatening the family members \nof the deceased victim and also create problems of law and order situation. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"534034\" id=\"span_1\">In <a href=\"/doc/534034/\" id=\"a_4\">Gurcharan Singh and Others vs. State (Delhi Administration</a>), AIR 1978 \nSC 179, this Court has observed that while granting of bail the Court has to consider \nthe nature and gravity of the circumstances in which the offence is committed, the \nposition and status of the accused with reference to the victim and witnesses, the \nlikelihood of the accused fleeing from justice, of repeating the offence, of jeopardizing \nhis own life being faced with a grim prospect of the possible conviction in the case, of \ntampering with witness, the history of the case as well as of its investigation and other \nrelevant grounds.  It was further observed by this Court that the Sessions Judge did not \ntake into proper account the grave apprehension of the prosecution that there was a \nlikelihood of the accused persons tampering with the prosecution witnesses.  In the \npeculiar nature of the case revealed from the allegations and the position of the \naccused in relation to the eye witnesses it was incumbent upon the sessions Judge to \ngive proper weight to the serious apprehension of the proper case with regard to the \ntampering with the eye witnesses, which was urged before him in resisting the \napplication for bail.</span>  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"159846035\" id=\"span_2\">In The State through the <a href=\"/doc/159846035/\" id=\"a_5\">Delhi Administration vs. Sanjay Gandhi</a> AIR 1978 \nSC 961, this Court observed as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">&quot;.. providing by the test of balance of probabilities that the accused has \nabused his liberty or that there is a reasonable apprehension that he will \ninterfere with the course of justice is all that is necessary in order to succeed \nin an application for cancellation of bail.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"295232\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/295232/\" id=\"a_6\">Dolat Ram and Others vs. State of Haryana</a> (1995) 1 SCC 349, it was \nobserved by this Court as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">&quot;Very cogent and overwhelming circumstances are necessary for an order \ndirecting the cancellation of the bail, already granted.  Generally speaking, \nthe grounds for cancellation of bail, broadly (illustrative and not exhaustive) \nare: interference or attempt to interfere with the due course of \nadministration of justice or evasion or attempt to evade the due course of \njustice or abuse of the concession granted to the accused in any manner.  \nThe satisfaction of the Court, on the basis of material placed on the record \nof the possibility of the accused absconding is yet another reason justifying \nthe cancellation of bail.  However, bail once granted should not be \ncancelled in a mechanical manner without considering whether any \nsupervening circumstances have rendered it no longer conducive to a fair \ntrial to allow the accused to retain his freedom by enjoying the concession \nof bail during the trial.  These principles, it appears, were lost sight of by \nthe High Court when it decided to cancel the bail, already granted.  The \nHigh Court it appears to us overlooked the distinction of the factors \nrelevant for rejecting bail in a non-bailable case in the first instance and the \ncancellation of bail already granted.&quot;  \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1127964\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"295232\" id=\"span_5\">Learned counsel for the respondent cited two decisions being <a href=\"/doc/295232/\" id=\"a_7\">Dolat Ram and \nOthers</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/1127964/\" id=\"a_8\">Mehboob Dawood Shaikh vs. State of Maharashtra</a> (2004) 2 \nSCC 362 and submitted that bail once granted should not be cancelled in a mechanical \nmanner without considering any supervening circumstances have rendered it no longer \nconducive to a fair trial to allow the accused to retain this freedom by enjoying the \nconcession of bail during the trial.  He would also further submit the cancellation of bail \nis a harsh order because it takes away the liberty of the individual granted and is not \nlikely to be resorted to and that this Court in exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1218877/\" id=\"a_9\">Article \n136(1)</a> of the Constitution of India does not ordinarily interfere with the grant of \ncancellation of bail.</span></span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"159846035\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"534034\" id=\"span_7\">The argument advanced by learned counsel for the respondent is \nwithout substance and devoid of merit and against the consistent view taken by this \nCourt in the judgment reported in <a href=\"/doc/534034/\" id=\"a_10\">Gurcharan Singh and Others</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/159846035/\" id=\"a_11\">Sanjay \nGandhi</a> (supra). In the instant case, the accused Digambar Mishra had been found and \nheld guilty under Section 109 read with <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_12\">Sections 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_13\">307</a> I.P.C and he was \nsentenced to undergo RI for life for the offence under Section 109 read with <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_14\">Sections \n302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_15\">307</a> I.P.C.

In the peculiar nature of the case \nrevealed from the allegations and the position of the accused in relation to the eye \nwitnesses it was incumbent upon the High Court to give proper weight to the serious \napprehension of the complainant which was urged before him in resisting the \napplication for bail.  The High Court, in our opinion, had failed to properly appreciate the \nentire position.  Therefore, this Court will be justified under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 136</a> of the \nConstitution of India in interfering with the discretion exercised by the High Court in \ngranting the bail of the accused persons.  The High Court has not bestowed its attention \non these above factors apart from others.  There cannot be an inexorable formula in the \nmatter of granting bail.  The facts and circumstances of each case will govern the \nexercise of judicial discretion in granting or canceling bail.  The case on hand is one \nsuch which would justify our interference under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution with a \ndiscretion exercised by the High Court in granting bail of the respondents in this case.  \nThe appeals are allowed and the order passed by the High Court in granting bail in \nCriminal Appeal Nos. 50 of 2004 and 62 of 2004 stands set aside and cancelled and \nthe Police Authorities are at liberty to re-arrest the accused and proceed further in \naccordance with law.  Any observation made by us in this order in canceling the bail will \nnot prejudice the High Court in considering the appeal filed by the accused on its own \nmerits and dispose of the same in accordance with law.    \n</p>\n\n             \t\t\t\t\t\t\n","numcites":13,"numcitedby":93,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":468792,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"cancellation of bail","formInput":"cancellation%20of%20bail"},{"value":"grant of bail","formInput":"grant%20of%20bail"},{"value":"non speaking order","formInput":"non%20speaking%20order"},{"value":"no common intention","formInput":"no%20common%20intention"},{"value":"fair trial","formInput":"fair%20trial"},{"value":"article 136","formInput":"article%20136"},{"value":"bail granted","formInput":"bail%20granted"},{"value":"307 ipc","formInput":"307%20ipc"},{"value":" special leave petition","formInput":"%20special%20leave%20petition"},{"value":"abscondence","formInput":"abscondence"},{"value":"section 307","formInput":"section%20307"},{"value":"speaking order ","formInput":"speaking%20order%20"},{"value":"\"cancellation of bail\"","formInput":"%22cancellation%20of%20bail%22"},{"value":"threat","formInput":"threat"},{"value":"indian penal code 307","formInput":"indian%20penal%20code%20307"},{"value":"non-speaking order","formInput":"non-speaking%20order"},{"value":"\"fair trial\"","formInput":"%22fair%20trial%22"},{"value":"bail order","formInput":"bail%20order"},{"value":"anil kumar mishra","formInput":"anil%20kumar%20mishra"},{"value":"munger","formInput":"munger"}],"cats":[{"value":"murder","formInput":"tag:murder"},{"value":"special-leave-appeal-by-supreme-court","formInput":"tag:special-leave-appeal-by-supreme-court"},{"value":"attempt-to-murder","formInput":"tag:attempt-to-murder"},{"value":"common-intention","formInput":"tag:common-intention"},{"value":"punishment-for-using-arms","formInput":"tag:punishment-for-using-arms"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
