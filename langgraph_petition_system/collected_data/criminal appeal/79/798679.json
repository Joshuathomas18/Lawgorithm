Three of the accused whose appeals \nwere  dismissed  by  the High Court, have  preferred Criminal \nAppeal Nos.1072-73 of 2003 and the State has preferred \nCriminal Appeal Nos.1074-75 of 2003 against the acquittal of \ntwo of the accused persons who were convicted by the trial \ncourt for the above mentioned offences. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">We will first take up Criminal Appeal Nos.1072-73 of \n2003 for consideration which, as stated above, are the appeals \nfiled by the convicted accused. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">The facts necessary for the disposal of these appeals, \nbriefly stated, are as follows :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\tIt is the prosecution case that there was enmity between \none of the deceased Abid Ali and A-3 Jaishree Yadav, A-5 \nDaddan Yadav in regard to the auction and recovery of \nTehbazari of the area between village Tatil Tola and Nawalpur \ncrossing. A-6 Ram Pratap Yadav bore an enmity against the \ndeceased Abid Ali on account of a pending litigation relating to \na land in village Tatil Tola. A-1 Hafiz Khairul Bashr was on \ninimical terms with the said deceased in relation to the fixation \nof an electric pole on the chowk road. It is also the prosecution \ncase that on account of these enmities, these accused persons \nwere waiting for an opportunity to eliminate said deceased Abid \nAli. It is the further case of the prosecution that on 23.9.1993 at \nabout 5.50 p.m. deceased Abid Ali had come from Deoria, his \nplace of residence, in his private jeep and was sitting on a \nTakhat in front of Pervez Book Stores, north of Nawalpur \ncrossing. At that moment, Raju @ Noor Alam (PW-6) who had \na shop selling sand and clay, came to deceased Abid Ali and \ncomplained that A-3 Jaishree Yadav was raising a dispute with \nhim (PW-6) in regard to Tehbazari money. It is also the \nprosecution case that PW-1 who was working as a teacher in a \nSchool at Salempur of which the deceased Abid Ali was the \nManager, was then passing through the said place where the \nsaid deceased was sitting and seeing him PW-1 came to talk to \nthe said deceased. This was at about 4.15 p.m. Prosecution also \nstates that PW-3 Arif Ali, son of deceased Abid Ali, who was a \nresident of that village, was also present there at that time. It is \nthe further case of the prosecution that at that time 8 persons \nincluding A-1 Hafiz Khairul Bashr, A-2 Jaheed, A-3 Jaishree \nYadav, A-4 Manish Yadav, A-5 Daddan Yadav, A-6 Ram \nPratap yadav and two other unidentified persons came armed to \nthat place. Amongst them, A-1 and A-2 and the unidentified \npersons were having country-made pistols (katta), A-3 and A-4 \nwere carrying bombs and bags in their hands; A-5 and A-6 were \ncarrying a knife and an iron &#x27;Dav&#x27; respectively. Prosecution \nfurther alleges that A-3 Jaishree Yadav questioned PW-6 as to \nthe propriety of his complaint to deceased Abid Ali. Other \naccused questioned the authority of deceased Abid Ali to \nmeddle in a dispute between them and PW-6. It is stated the \ndeceased Abid Ali warned them by asking them to have control \nover their language. At this stage the prosecution alleges A-1 \nexhorted the other accused to kill Abid Ali. Pursuant to the \nsame, A-3 and A-4 hurled bombs at Abid Ali because of which  \nAbid Ali received injuries and started running northwards to \nsave himself. Prosecution then alleges that all the accused \npersons chased the deceased Abid Ali, hurling bombs and firing \npistol shots at him and in this process when Abid Ali reached \n&#x27;Palani&#x27;, of one Idris, one Mahmood Shah (deceased No.2), a \nresident of the same village, tried to intervene, hence, the \naccused hurled bombs and fired pistol shots at Abid Ali and \nMahmood Shah  in front of the shop of one Ram Nakshatra \nconsequent to which both Abid Ali and Mahmood Shah \nsuccumbed to their injuries on the spot. During the first attack \non Abid Ali when he was sitting on the Takhat, PW-1 who was \nnearby also suffered an injury on his shoulder. Prosecution also \nalleges that there was a young boy who was also sitting on the \nTakhat with deceased Abid Ali who also suffered some injuries. \nPW-3 who was nearby ran after his father but he was not \nattacked by the assailants.  The assailants after causing fatal \ninjuries to Abid Ali and Mahmood Shah ran away from the \nplace of incident shouting at and threatening the witnesses. PW-\n3 who is an eye-witness to the incident, then went to Salempur \nPolice Station which is stated to be about 3-4 kms. away from \nthe place of incident with a written complaint scribed by his \nbrother-in-law and gave the same to PW-8 Ram Shiromani \nPandey who was the officer-in-charge of the Police Station who \nregistered a case at about 5.30 p.m. on 23.9.1993 and proceeded \nto the place of incident with his staff. There he recorded the \nstatements of some witnesses and conducted the spot \nPanchnama, inquest Panchnama of the dead body and recovered \ncertain empty cartridges, splinters of the bomb and one live \nbomb found at the place. It is relevant to note herein that before \nleaving for the place of the incident, PW-8 had sent a special \nreport to the Jurisdictional Magistrate through a Constable in \nhis Police Station to Deoria which is about 25-27 kms. from \nSalempur. During the course of his visit to the spot and \npreparation of the Panchnamas it is stated that senior officers on \ncoming to know of the double murder case through radio \ntransmitters, reached the spot. PW-8 after completing the \ninquest sent the dead bodies to Deoria along with Police \nConstable Durga Prasad PW-7 in a jeep around mid-night of \n23/24.9.1993. It is stated that in view of the fact that on the way \nthe said jeep developed mechanical problems and the same \ncould be repaired only in the early hours of 24.9.1993, he \nhanded over the bodies at about 10 a.m. to PW-4 Dr. V.D. \nSrivastava who conducted the post mortem on the dead bodies \nof Abid Ali and Mahmood Shah on 24.9.1993 at 10.30 a.m. and \n12.15 p.m. respectively. He noticed 11 injuries on different \nparts of Abid Ali&#x27;s body with corresponding internal injuries. In \nthe opinion of PW-4 death of Abid Ali was due to shock and \nhaemorrhage as a result of ante-mortem injuries.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">\tOn the body of Mahmood Shah, PW-4 noticed 3 external \ninjuries which were multiple circular wounds and multiple \ncircular lacerated wounds. On internal examination, he found  \ncorresponding injuries on various parts of the body. He also \nrecovered a large number of pellets, totalling 89 from the body \nof Mahmood Shah and he opined that the death of Mahmood \nShah was also due to shock and haemorrhage as a result of ante-\nmortem injuries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">\tProsecution alleges that in spite of its best efforts, the \naccused persons could not be traced until they surrendered \nbefore the court. It is the case of PW-8 that PW-1 though \nnamed in the FIR as an eye-witness was not available for \nrecording his statement and it is only after about 9-10 days \nwhen he came back to the village and his statement could be \nrecorded; whereas PW-6&#x27;s statement was recorded on \n24.9.1993 at about 6 a.m. It is also the case of the prosecution \nthat two of the unidentified persons were never traced, hence, \nthey could not be sent up for trial while the six named accused \npersons were committed for trial by A.C.J.M., Deoria for \noffences under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_8\">sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_9\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_10\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_11\">504</a>, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_12\">506</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1255223/\" id=\"a_13\">507</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_14\">302</a> and \n<a href=\"/doc/895566/\" id=\"a_15\">sections 4</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1335368/\" id=\"a_16\">5</a> of the Explosive Substances Act. But the trial \ncourt framed charges only for offences under sections 143, 148, \n302 read with section 149, section 307 read with 149, 504 and \n506 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_17\">IPC</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">\tIn view of the fact that A-1 Hafiz Khairul Bashr was not \nin a medically fit condition to face trial, his trial was separated \nand the other 5 accused persons were tried by the III Additional \nSessions Judge, Deoria, for offences as stated above, in \nSessions Trial No.36 of 1994. The trial court after considering \nthe material produced by the prosecution, came to the \nconclusion that accused 2 to 6 were guilty of the offences \ncharged against them hence convicted them under <a href=\"/doc/1096965/\" id=\"a_18\">section 143</a> \nIPC to RI for 6 months, under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_19\">section 148</a> IPC RI for 1 year and \nfor an offence punishable under section 302 read with section \n149 life imprisonment and for an offence under section 307 \nread with section 149, <a href=\"/doc/1090977/\" id=\"a_20\">7</a> years&#x27; RI and for an offence under \n<a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_21\">section 504</a> IPC 6 months&#x27; RI and finally for an offence under \n<a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_22\">section 506</a> IPC, 6 months&#x27; RI was awarded. The court also \ndirected all the sentences to run concurrently.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">\tIt is against the said conviction and sentence of the trial \ncourt, the convicted accused preferred 4 appeals before the \nHigh Court of Judicature at Allahabad and the High Court by \nthe impugned judgment, confirmed the conviction and sentence \nimposed on A-2 Jaheed, A-3 Jaishree Yadav, A-4 Manish \nYadav, while it allowed the appeals of A-5 Daddan Yadav and \nA-6 Ram Pratap Yadav.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">\tOut of the 3 convicted accused, A-2 Jaheed has not \npreferred any appeal hence his conviction and sentence has \nbecome final, while A-3 Jaishree Yadav and A-4 Manish Yadav \nhave preferred the abovenoted criminal appeals. The State of \nU.P. being aggrieved by the acquittal of A-5 Daddan Yadav and \nA-6 Ram Pratap Yadav has preferred the connected criminal \nappeal noted hereinabove.          \n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">\tShri Sushil Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing for the \nappellants contended that the prosecution case ought not to have \nbeen accepted by the courts below because of the serious infirmity \nfound in the investigation as also possible doubt as to the presence \nof the eye-witnesses produced by the prosecution at the trial. He \nsubmitted that though the prosecution has alleged that the \ncomplaint of the incident in question was lodged at Salempur \nPolice Station at 5.30 p.m., the same cannot be believed for more \nthan one reason and according to him the FIR is a product of \ndeliberation and is anti-timed. Elaborating this contention, he \nsubmitted that the special report in regard to the incident in \nquestion reached the Jurisdictional Magistrate at Deoria only on \n24.9.1993 and the actual time of receipt of this special report has \nnot been noted by the Jurisdictional Magistrate. It is his contention \nthat if really the FIR had come into existence as stated by the \nprosecution and the complete details of the case and the facts as \nfound in the complaint and in the inquest report would have been \nsent to the doctor who was to conduct post mortem but what in fact \nwas sent along with the dead body and the requisition for post \nmortem was not really the true copy of the inquest report and the \ncomplaint. He further submitted the fact that the dead body was \ndelivered to the doctor of Deoria at about 10 O&#x27;clock in the \nmorning on 24.9.1993  which also indicates the fact that the \nincident in question must have come to the knowledge of the \npolice very late in the evening of 23.9.1993, hence, a detailed FIR \nimplicating the accused was prepared in deliberation with PW-3, \nthe son of the deceased Abid Ali much later than 5.30 P.M.. He \nalso pointed out that it has come on record that when radio \ntransmission messages were sent to the superior officers, names of \nall accused were not mentioned obviously because same was not \nknown to the Investigating Officer at that time. From the material \non record, he pointed out that there were good reasons for PW-3 to \nimplicate the appellants, hence, deceased being a prominent person \nthe accused who were admittedly inimical towards him were \nfalsely implicated.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">\tFurther, he contended that the evidence of PW-1 ought not \nto have been believed because he was closely connected with the \ndeceased Abid Ali in his illegal activities in managing the school. \nIt is also contended that it is highly improbable that a person who \nwitnessed the murder of the Manager of his school and with whom \nhe was closely connected would have disappeared from the place \nof incident and appeared only after 10 days  to make his statement \nbefore the police. The further contention of the learned counsel in \nthis regard was that the so called injury suffered by PW-1 is a \nmake believe one and if at all such injury was there the same must \nhave been a self-inflicted one to create evidence. In regard to PW-\n3, the son of the deceased who is the complainant and also an eye-\nwitness to the incident, learned counsel submitted that the \ncontradictions, omissions and improvements proved by the defence \nin the cross-examination of this witness clearly established that this \nwitness is one who cannot be believed. At any rate this witness is \nnot a witness who could be termed as an absolutely reliable \nwitness on whose sole evidence a conviction could be based \nwithout acceptable corroboration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">\tIn regard to PW-6, the other eye-witness, learned counsel \nsubmitted that this witness was not present at the time when the \npolice went to the spot of the incident nor was he present at the \ntime of inquest proceedings. His statement was recorded only on \nthe next day, hence, his evidence also could not have been \nbelieved.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">\tLearned counsel also pointed out that the medical evidence \nis contradictory to the oral evidence led by the prosecution, hence, \nthe appellants are entitled to acquittal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\tHe supported the findings of the High Court that from the \nprosecution case itself, it is clear that the accused Daddan Yadav \nand Ram Pratap Yadav have not taken part in the incident in \nquestion and they were implicated solely because there was some \nenmity between them and the deceased Abid Ali, hence, the High \nCourt was justified in allowing their appeal.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">         The argument addressed by the learned counsel before us are \nsimilar to the ones that were addressed by his counter parts in the \ncourts below. Both the courts below so far as the convicted \nappellant before us are concerned have concurrently come to the \nconclusion that these arguments cannot be accepted and have held \nthat the prosecution has established its case to the hilt to prove the \nguilt of the convicted accused. It is in the backdrop of the \nconcurrent findings of the two courts below that we will now \nexamine the contentions advanced before us by the learned counsel \nappearing for the accused whose guilt have been upheld \nconcurrently by two courts below. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">It is the case of the prosecution that PW-3 Arif Ali who is a \nresident of village Nawalpur within the limits of Salempur Police \nStation came to the said police station on 23.9.1993 at 5.30 p.m. \nand gave a written report Ext.Ka-2 to PW-8 the Officer-in-Charge \nof the said police station. According to PW-8, he registered a crime \nbased on the said complaint of PW-3 at 5.50 p.m. on the same day,  \nwhich has been proved by the production of the general diary of \nthe police station Ex.Ka-8. He also submitted that he sent a special \nreport to the Jurisdiction Magistrate on 23.9.1993 at about 7 p.m. \nthrough Constable Dheeraj. He further stated that from the entry in \nthe general diary, it is seen that Constable Dheeraj reported back to \nthe police station at about 8 a.m. on 24.9.1993 . He has denied that \nthe special report was not sent on 23.9.1993. A perusal of the entry \nmade by the Chief Judicial Magistrate, Deoria in the special report \nshows that the same was received by him on 24.9.1993 but the \nactual time of the report is not noted in the said entry, however it is \nclear that the said report was received by him at his residence. \nBased on this the learned counsel for the appellants had argued that \nit is possible that this report might have reached later in the day on \n24.9.1993, but this argument is not supported by any material on \nrecord. On the contrary from the entry made in the general diary of \nthe police station, it is clear that Constable Dheeraj who was \nentrusted with the job of delivering the special report to the \nMagistrate had returned back to duty at Salempur Police Station at \n8 O&#x27;clock on 24.9.1993. Bearing in mind that the distance between \nSalempur Police Station and Deoria is about 28 to 29 kms. as seen \nfrom the records it is clear that the special report has reached the \nJurisdiction Magistrate much earlier than 8 O&#x27;clock in the morning \nof 24.9.1993. Though it would have been more appropriate and \nless controversial if only the concerned Magistrate had noted the \nactual time of receipt of the special report,  still on facts and \ncircumstances of this case as stated above, we are of the opinion \nthat the special report must have reached the Jurisdictional \nMagistrate much earlier than 8 a.m.  Since by then the constable \nwho carried the report had come back to Salempur on 24.9.1993 \nwhich fits in with the prosecution case that the same was sent from \nthe police station in the evening of 23.9.1993 at about 7 p.m. So on \nthis count, it cannot be said that the FIR is anti timed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">\t   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1597919\" id=\"span_1\">The next contention in this regard is that the requisition \nsent by PW-8 to PW-4, the doctor, to conduct post mortem did not \naccompany all the particulars found in the inquest report and the \ncomplaint like the particulars of the case, the weapon used and the \nnames of the accused persons etc. which according to the learned \ncounsel for the accused indicates that when the dead body was sent \nfor post mortem the investigating agency did not know the full \nparticulars of the case. We do not think that these omissions, if \nany, would lead to the conclusion that the FIR is anti-timed. It is a \nsettled principle in law that though it is necessary to give the gist \nof the information collected during the course of inquest \nproceedings and from the material available in the FIR to the \ndoctor conducting the post mortem, it is not necessary to give all \nthe particulars as contained in either of the above said documents. \nThis is clear from the judgment of this Court in the case of \n<a href=\"/doc/1597919/\" id=\"a_23\">Mahendra Rai vs. Mithilesh Rai &amp; Ors.</a> (1997 10 SCC 605). \nLearned counsel had next contended that it has come on \nrecord that the incident in question was reported to the higher \nauthorities through radio transmission and an application filed by \nthe defence to produce the records pertaining to this transmission \nhas been rejected by the trial court and according to the material \navailable on record the said transmission had not given the names \nof all the accused concerned to the senior officers which also \nindicated the fact that the FIR in question has come into existence \nafter the radio transmission was made. We are unable to accept this \nargument either. We think the trial court has given good reasons \nfor not allowing the application for summoning the records \npertaining to radio transmission of police communication, at any \nrate the accused having not challenged the said order, the same has \nbecome final. That apart it should be noted that the messages \ntransmitted to higher authorities of an incident in question is only \nan information sent about a crime that has occurred which does not \nrequire all the particulars of the crime to be stated. In the instant \ncase obviously because one of the deceased was a prominent \nperson of the area concerned, the higher authorities were informed \nthrough radio transmission that his murder has taken place and in \nsuch communication, in our opinion, it is not necessary that the \nnames of all the persons or other particulars as stated in complaint \nought to have been mentioned or that non mentioning of such \nparticulars in such communication gives rise to an inference that at \nthe time when the transmission was made the investigating agency \nwas not in the know of the names of all the accused. Both the \ncourts below have considered these aspects of the defence case as \nto anti-timing of the FIR and have rejected the same and we are in \nagreement with the findings of the courts below, hence, we reject \nthis contention of the learned counsel for the appellants in regard \nto anti-timing of the FIR.</span>      \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">The next contention of the learned counsel for the \nappellant is that the evidence of PW-1 Ram Kripal Singh ought \nnot to have been relied upon by the two courts below. It is \nargued that this witness was closely connected with deceased \nAbid Ali and was hand in glove with him in the mis- \nmanagement of the School and it is because of this nexus that \nhe has come forward to give evidence inspite of the fact that he \nwas not present at the time of the incident. It was also submitted \nthat the so called injury suffered by this witness was so \nsuperficial that it cannot be said to have been caused by the \nflying splinter of the bomb that exploded. Learned counsel also \ncontended that the evidence of PW-5 Dr. A.K. Upadhyay who \ntreated this witness is highly artificial and cannot be accepted \nprimarily because of the fact that the injury suffered by the \nwitness was not recorded in the medico-legal register of the \ndispensary. It is the further contention on behalf of the \nappellants in regard to PW1 that if really he was an eye witness \nto the incident he would not have disappeared for nearly 10 \ndays in spite of his familiarity with deceased Abid Ali. It was \nalso alleged that the explanation given by this witness as to his \nnon-availability  to the Police for almost 10 days is hard to \nbelieve.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">There is no doubt that this witness was closely connected \nwith the deceased Abid Ali in view of the fact that he was a \nteacher in the School of which said deceased was the Manager. \nBy this it cannot be presumed that this witness has volunteered \nto be a false witness to the incident. It is a fact that the injury \nsuffered by this witness is of minor nature but PW-5 who \ntreated the said injury has stated that on 23.9.93 evening PW1 \nhad come to him for treatment of an injury suffered by him.  He \nhas also stated that though the injury was simple in nature, he \nhad treated the same and the said injury could have been caused  \nby a flying splinter of a bomb. It is a fact that the doctor did not \nenter this injury in the medico-legal register but PW-5 the \ndoctor has given an explanation that since the witness did not \nwant to make a Police case out of the same he recorded this \ninjury in the accident injury register. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">It is also true that PW1 was not available to the Police for \nnearly 10 days after the incident but the explanation given by \nthis witness is quite plausible that his family was afraid for his \nsafety hence he went to his in-laws&#x27; place and remained there \nand it is only when things settled down he decided to come out \nand give a statement to the Police. The possibility of his fear of \nretaliation is supported by the evidence of PW-8 I.O. who \nstated that there was tension in the village and at the time of \nfuneral of the deceased he had to make Police bandobust which \nindicates the possibility of PW-1&#x27;s apprehension and his \nconsequent non-availability to the investigating agency.  There \nis one other aspect of this case which will have to be borne in \nmind while considering the evidence of PW-1. His name has \nbeen mentioned in the FIR as a person who was present at the \ntime the incident took place. It is also stated in the  FIR that in \nthe said incident PW-1 was injured. We have already noticed \nthat the prosecution has established that this complaint was \nfiled in the Salempur Police Station at 5.30 p.m. If really this \nwitness was not present at the time of incident in question we \ndo not think PW-3 would have included his name without even \nknowing the whereabouts of this witness on that day and by \nattributing an imaginary injury to him. In his examination in \nchief this witness has clearly narrated the incident involving the \nnamed accused persons as also the overt acts attributed to them. \nOf course in the cross examination the defence has brought out \nthat this person is closely connected with deceased Abid Ali \ntherefore a suggestion was made that he was deposing falsely. \nThis suggestion has been denied by the appellant. In the cross \nexamination defence has brought about certain omissions, \ncontradictions and improvements in the evidence of this \nwitness. These shortcomings in the evidence of this witness will \nhave to be considered in the background of the fact that this \nwitness was subjected to nearly 217 questions over a period of \n14 months i.e. his cross examination starting on 14.8.1994 and \nending on 28.11.1995. Both the courts below have taken \njudicial notice of this fact, not only in regard to this witness but \nin regard to other witnesses also and have come to the \nconcurrent conclusion that when a witness is subjected to such \nlengthy arduous cross examination over a lengthy period of \ntime there is always a possibility of the witnesses committing \nmistakes which can be termed as omissions, improvements and \ncontradictions therefore those infirmities will have to be \nappreciated in the back ground of ground realities which makes \nthe witness confused because of the filibustering tactics of the \ncross examining Counsel.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">PW-3&#x27;s evidence was challenged by the defence in the \ncourts below as well as before this Court on the ground that he \nis a partisan and biased witness being the son of the deceased \nAbid Ali. This fact of course is not disputed by the witness \nbecause it is the case of the prosecution itself that the deceased \nAbid Ali was inimical to accused persons for various reasons \nmentioned hereinabove. PW1&#x27;s  presence at the place and time \nof the incident was challenged by learned counsel for the \naccused before us primarily on the ground that if really he was \npresent at the time of incident he would have tried to protect his \nfather and there was no material to show that any such thing \nwas done by this witness. It was also pointed out from his \nevidence that though his father was profusely bleeding the \nclothes of this witness were not blood stained which indicated \nthat he never even touched the body of his father which is an \nunnatural conduct on the part of a son present at the time of the \nmurder of his father. This witness when cross examined in this \nregard, admitted that since his father had died already he did not \ncarry the body of his father nor did he touch the body of his \nfather. In our opinion different people react differently to a \ngiven situation and from the fact that this witness did not \nchoose to fall on the body of his father or carry his dead body \nfrom where it was lying, by itself cannot be a ground to reject \nhis evidence. We have already accepted the fact that the \ncomplaint in question was lodged by this witness soon after the \nincident in question and PW-8 in his evidence has spoken to the \ncomplaint being lodged by this witness and he being present \nthroughout the investigation proceedings at the spot on that day. \nHis presence at the place of incident also cannot be treated as a \nchance presence inasmuch as he is a resident of that village \nthough his father stays in Deoria. Learned counsel for the \nappellant submitted that it is an admitted fact that this witness \nhas stated that he is an educated person and according to this \nwitness the complaint in question was not written down by him \nbut by his brother-in-law which is also an unnatural conduct \nindicating that he might not have been present at the time of \nincident. We do not think this could also be a ground to suspect \nthe presence of this witness at the time and place of incident. \nThis witness in his evidence has stated that since his brother-in-\nlaw was available who was also a literate he dictated the \ncomplaint to him which was scribed by his brother-in-law and \nwe do not find anything unnatural in this conduct either. Next \nground of attack in regard to this evidence of this witness is that \nhe has not stated all the motives stated in his evidence before \nthe court in the complaint. In other words the complaint did not \ncontain details of the motives as spoken to by this witness in his \nevidence before the court. We do not think that this also could \nbe a ground to reject the evidence of this witness. In the \ncomplaint this witness has specifically stated A-3 and A-4 had \nenmity with his father in regard to the auction of Tehbazari of \nNawalpur chowk. He has further mentioned in the complaint \nthat so far as accused Ram Pratap Yadav is concerned his father \nhad a litigation pertaining to a particular land and so far as \nHafiz Khairul Bashr is concerned his father had a dispute \npertaining to the erection of an electric pole. He has also \nmentioned in the complaint about an altercation PW-6 had with \nA-3 and A-4 in regard to the payment of Tehbazari in regard to \nwhich PW-6 had made a complaint to his father on the fateful \nday.   In this background we hardly find any force in the \nargument of learned counsel for the accused that this witness \nhas made improvement in his evidence from what he had stated \nin his complaint. Of course during the course of his cross \nexamination he has elaborated the nature of enmity that his \nfather had with these accused persons but then that could hardly \nbe a reason to contend that what is stated in the complaint is \neither different from what is stated in the evidence in regard to \nthe motive or the witness has made improvement in regard to \nthe motive of the accused to commit the crime. Apart from the \nabove challenge to the evidence of this witness, learned counsel \nfor the accused pointed out certain contradictions, omissions \nand improvements found in his cross examination but then this \nagain will have to be considered as considered by the courts \nbelow, in the background of the fact that the cross examination \nof this witness was also spread over a period nearly 6 months \nand he was subjected to nearly 480 questions. In this \nbackground for the reasons already stated above, as held by the \ntwo courts below we do not think these contradictions, \nimprovements and omissions would affect the credibility of this \nwitness either.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">The next witness cited by the prosecution as an eye-\nwitness to the incident is PW-6 Raju alias Noor Alam. He is \nalso a resident of Nawalpur who in his evidence stated that on \n23.9.1993 he had an argument with A-5 Daddan Yadav and A-3 \nJaishree Yadav in relation to the payment of Tehbazari for \nhaving sold some sand to them. He stated that he made a \ncomplaint to the deceased Abid Ali who had come to that \nvillage on that day and at that time the accused persons came \narmed with bombs, kattas and other sharp-edged weapons and \nattacked the deceased with the same and the deceased having \nsuffered injuries, started running towards North and at a place \nnear &#x27;Palani&#x27; the accused persons shot at him as also at \nMahmood Shah who came to the aid of the deceased Abid Ali \nconsequent to which these victims died. The challenge to the \nevidence of this witness by the appellant is primarily based on \nthe fact that he is a partisan witness and in his witness too a \nlarge number of contradictions, improvements and omissions \nwere established during the cross-examination. We must notice \nthat the name of this witness is also mentioned in the complaint \nand even the fact that there was an altercation between A-3 \nJaishree Yadav and A-4 in payment of Tehbazari is also \nmentioned in the complaint which indicates that this witness \nwas present at the time of the incident. In his examination in \nchief he has clearly stated the attack on the deceased by the \naccused persons and we are not prepared to reject this evidence \non the ground that there have been some contradictions, \nomissions and improvements in his evidence. Even this witness \nwas subjected to lengthy cross-examination over a long period \nof time and as held by the two courts below, in such type of \ncross-examination some improvements, contradictions and \nomissions are bound to occur which if not found fatal to the \nevidence given in the examination in chief would not in any \nmanner affect the evidentiary value of the witness given in the \nexamination in chief.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">Another argument addressed on behalf of the appellants \nto be noticed is that there was considerable delay in sending the \ndead bodies for post mortem. According to the learned counsel, \nthough a complaint in regard to the incident in question was \nlodged at about 5.30 p.m., the dead bodies reached the hospital \nat Deoria only at about 9.30 a.m. on 24.9.1993, therefore, this \nalso indicates that the complaint in question had not been \nlodged, as alleged by the prosecution. It is true that the dead \nbodies reached the hospital at Deoria only at about 9.30 a.m. \nthe next day but from the evidence of PW-8, the Investigating \nOfficer, it is clear that he despatched the dead bodies to the \nhospital between 11 and 12 in the night of the incident through \nPW-7, Constable Durga Prasad, who took the dead bodies in  \njeeps but because of the fact that one of the jeeps broke down \non the way at a distance of about 13-14 kms. from Salempur, \nhence, they were not able to proceed further that night until the \njeeps were repaired in the morning. In this situation, the bodies \nreached the hospital only at about 9.30 a.m. In our opinion, the \nexplanation given by PW-7 in regard to the delay in delivery of \nthe dead bodies for post mortem cannot be rejected. Therefore, \nthe contention that the delay in delivering the dead bodies \nindicates that the First Information Report was anti-timed, \ncannot be accepted. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">It was also sought to be argued that there is contradiction \nbetween medical evidence and oral evidence.  We having \nperused the same, find from the evidence of the post mortem \nreport and the evidence of PW-4 Dr. V.D. Srivastava that the \nprosecution has established that both the deceased had died of \nshock and haemorrhage due to the injuries caused to them and \nthose injuries are such injuries as could be caused by the \nexplosion of a bomb, by the use of Kattas and sharp-edged \nweapons. We really do not find any reason whatsoever why this \ndoctor should give false evidence to support the prosecution \ncase. This witness was also subjected to nearly 170 questions \nover a period of a year i.e. between 18.5.1995 and 2.6.1996. In \nsuch circumstances we are in agreement with the findings of the \ntwo courts below that the prosecution has established its case \nbeyond all reasonable doubt as against the accused persons held \nguilty by the trial court and the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">This leaves us to consider the merit of Crl. Appeal \nNos.1074-75 of 2003 preferred by the State against the acquittal \nof A-5 Daddan Yadav and A-6 Ram Pratap Yadav. In regard to \nthese two accused persons the High Court has concurred with \nthe finding of the trial court that they were present and were \nmembers of the party of the accused persons when the crime in \nquestion was committed. The trial court accepted the evidence \nthat Ram Pratap Yadav abused deceased Abid Ali while others \nattacked the deceased. Similarly, the trial court also accepted \nthe evidence that A-5 had carried a &#x27;Dav&#x27; and attacked the \ndeceased due to which a corresponding incised wound was \nfound in the body of the deceased. The trial court also found as \na matter of fact that all the accused persons before it including \nA-5 Daddan Yadav and A-6 Ram Pratap Yadav were members \nof an unlawful assembly with a common object of causing the \ndeath of deceased. Therefore, they were also convicted along \nwith other accused persons for an offence punishable under \nsection 302 read with section 149 among other offences. The \nHigh Court did not give a finding that these accused persons \nwere not the members of an unlawful assembly and accepts the \nfact that they were present at the time of the incident but rather \nsurprisingly proceeds to give a finding in the following terms :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">&quot;\u0005 A perusal of the FIR shows that no role \nhas been assigned to appellants Daddan and \nRam Pratap. There is no allegation in it that \nthey had used knife and &#x27;Dav&#x27; in the \nincident. From the post mortem report Ext. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">Ka-3, also the use of Dav is excluded. Thus, \nthe complicity of appellant Ram Pratap in \nthe incident is ruled out. He had wrongly \nbeen convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1096965/\" id=\"a_24\">Sections 143</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_25\">148</a>, \n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_26\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_27\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_28\">307</a>, <a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_29\">504</a>, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_30\">506</a> IPC. So far as \nappellant Daddan is concerned, he is said to \nhave been armed with a knife. Neither in the \nFIR, nor in the ocular evidence, there is any \nmention that he used his knife on any of the \ndeceased or to injure Ram Kripal. In these \ncircumstances, his participation in the \nincident is also ruled out and his conviction \ncannot be justified.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">We are unable to agree with the above finding of the \nHigh Court on facts and circumstances of the case. It is the \nprosecution case right from the stage of the complaint that these \ntwo accused persons had enmity with the deceased Abid Ali. \nThey along with four other named accused and two other \nunnamed accused came together armed and remained members \nof the unlawful assembly till the attack on the deceased was \nover. This part of the prosecution case is accepted even by the \nHigh Court. If that be so, assuming for argument&#x27;s sake that \nthere is no material to show that these two accused persons took \nany part in the attack, that by itself would not take away the \nliability of these persons from being members of an unlawful \nassembly unless the High Court had given a specific finding \neither that they were not the members of the unlawful assembly \nat all or at any particular point of time they ceased to be the \nmembers of the said unlawful assembly. The High Court did \nnot give any such finding. On the contrary, it proceeds as if the \nmembers of an unlawful assembly who do not commit any \novert act are exonerated of the liability of being a member of an \nunlawful assembly. The trial court has held that the common \nobject of the unlawful assembly was to attack and kill Abid Ali \nbut in the process they also killed Mahmood Shah and \nconvicted the accused on that basis. The High Court, as stated \nabove, has nowhere held that these two accused persons, who \nare respondents in the State appeal before us, were not the \nmembers of the unlawful assembly or that they did not share the \ncommon object of that assembly.  In our opinion on the facts of \nthis case such a finding could not have been arrived at because \nevidence in this case shows these accused also had the motive, \nthey were present throughout  and escaped together.  Once \nthese facts are accepted it is difficult to exclude these accused \nfrom the liability under section 149 I.P.C. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"662558\" id=\"span_2\">The trial court even found that these two accused persons \nalso carried deadly weapons and some of the injuries found on \nthe dead body could be attributed to the weapons carried by \nthem. Of course, the High Court differs with the trial court in \nthis regard that there was no corresponding injury which could \nbe attributed to the weapon carried by these appellants but that \nby itself, in our opinion, is not sufficient to extricate these two \naccused persons from the charge of being members of an \nunlawful assembly which attacked and killed Abid Ali and \nMahmood Shah. It is trite law that a person who is a member of \nan unlawful assembly even if he does not commit any overt act \nbut shares the common object of such an unlawful assembly, \nwill be liable for the consequences of the same. We do not think \nthat this principle in law requires any precedent to be relied \nupon but if need be, the same could be found in the judgment of \nthis Court in the case of Yunis alias <a href=\"/doc/662558/\" id=\"a_31\">Kariya v. State of M.P.</a> \n(2003 1 SCC 425) wherein this Court has held that &quot;Even if no \novert act is imputed to a particular person, when the charge is \nunder <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 149</a> IPC, the presence of the accused as part of an \nunlawful assembly is sufficient for conviction. The fact that the \naccused was a member of the unlawful assembly is sufficient to \nhold him guilty.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">In view of the above principle in law, since the trial court \nhas found these respondent-accused guilty of being members of \nan unlawful assembly with the common object of causing the \nmurder of the deceased, and the High Court having not differed \nfrom the said finding, it erred in acquitting these respondent-\naccused solely on the ground that there is no evidence to show \nthat they had taken part in the actual assault. In our opinion, \nassuming that the High Court was correct in coming to the \nconclusion that these respondent-accused have not taken part in \nthe attack even then they having come together with the other \naccused armed, and having been members of the unlawful \nassembly and having shared the common object, they will be \nguilty of an offence punishable under section 302 read with \n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_33\">section 149</a> IPC.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">For the reasons stated above, we are not in agreement \nwith the finding of the appellate court in regard to the reasons \ngiven by it as to the acquittal of Daddan Yadav, Ram Pratap \nYadav, hence, the State appeal has to succeed. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">For all these reasons, we dismiss Crl. Appeal Nos. 1072-\n1073/2003 and allow Crl. Appeal Nos.1074-75/2003 of the \nState, set aside the judgment of the High Court and restore that \nof the trial court. The respondents in the said appeal, if on bail, \nshall surrender to their bail bonds and serve out the sentence \nawarded to them by the trial court.\n</p>   \n\n\n\n         \n\n\n\n\n","numcites":15,"numcitedby":67,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":798679,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"omissions contradictions and improvements","formInput":"omissions%20contradictions%20and%20improvements"},{"value":"Improvement and contradiction","formInput":"Improvement%20and%20contradiction"},{"value":"what is omission and contradiction","formInput":"what%20is%20omission%20and%20contradiction"},{"value":"anti-time ","formInput":"anti-time%20"},{"value":"tehbazari","formInput":"tehbazari"},{"value":"unlawful assembly","formInput":"unlawful%20assembly"},{"value":"ipc 506","formInput":"ipc%20506"},{"value":"sec 149 ipc","formInput":"sec%20149%20ipc"},{"value":"inquest report","formInput":"inquest%20report"},{"value":"\"general diary\"","formInput":"%22general%20diary%22"},{"value":"general diary","formInput":"general%20diary"},{"value":"omission and improvements","formInput":"omission%20and%20improvements"},{"value":"section 149 of indian penal code","formInput":"section%20149%20of%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"indian penal code 506","formInput":"indian%20penal%20code%20506"},{"value":"common object","formInput":"common%20object"},{"value":"panchnama ","formInput":"panchnama%20"},{"value":"bomb","formInput":"bomb"},{"value":"inquest","formInput":"inquest"},{"value":"member of an unlawful assembly","formInput":"member%20of%20an%20unlawful%20assembly"},{"value":"no overt act ","formInput":"no%20overt%20act%20"}],"cats":[{"value":"unlawful-assembly","formInput":"tag:unlawful-assembly"},{"value":"rioting","formInput":"tag:rioting"},{"value":"breach-of-peace","formInput":"tag:breach-of-peace"},{"value":"criminal-intimidation","formInput":"tag:criminal-intimidation"},{"value":"murder","formInput":"tag:murder"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
