Mr. Salve referred to the provisions of Chapter XIII\nand XIV of the Customs Act and contended that since there is\nno statutory provision prohibiting the presence of a counsel\nduring the interrogation of the person\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\t\t\t\t\t\t       251</span>\nconcerned,  a  request in this regard, if  made,  cannot  be\nlegitimately  refused.\t In any event, the  learned  counsel\nproceeded to urge, that in a situation where the possibility\nof the person under interrogation of being prosecuted as  an\naccused cannot be denied, he is entitled to  the  assistance\nof a lawyer during the questioning, because to deny him such\na right would be violative of the constitutional  protection\nunder <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution.  Alternatively, Mr.\nSalve\tcontended  that\t in  view  of\tthe   constitutional\nprotection  of\tlife  and  personal  liberty  guaranteed  by\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 21</a>, the person concerned is entitled to insist\tupon\nthe  presence  of his lawyer when he is\t questioned  by\t the\nofficers of the department.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1938988\" id=\"span_3\">4.

Mr. Salve referred to the provisions of the  <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_29\">Customs\nAct</a>  and contended that in view of the mandate\t in  <a href=\"/doc/1392092/\" id=\"a_30\">section\n108(3)</a> a person has to answer truthfully the question put to\nhim  by the Customs Officer and has to produce documents  or\nany  other  thing as may be required, and he is\t within\t his\nrights to refuse to answer such questions which may lead  to\nhis own prosecution.  An inquiry under the Act is held\tonly\nwhen prima facie some violation of the law takes place,\t and\nthe purpose of the inquiry is to identify the guilty  person\nwho  has  been\tdescribed  by the  learned  counsel  as\t the\npotential  accused.  The protection under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_31\">Article  20(3)</a>  is\nclaimed to be not limited to persons who are already accused\nbut to extend to cover a potential accused too; and a person\nunder interrogation may himself be such a potential accused.\nHe may, therefore, require the presence of a lawyer who\t can\nadvise\thim  as to which of the questions he may  refuse  to\nanswer in view of the protection under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 20(3).</a>  It is\nsubmitted  that to deny him this privilege is to deny him  a\nconstitutional\tright.\t We do not find any  merit  in\tthis\nargument in view of the decisions of this Court <a href=\"/doc/1938988/\" id=\"a_33\">referred  to\nabove</a>.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\t\t\t\t\t\t       252</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">     6.\t Clause\t (3) of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 20</a> declares that  no  person\naccused\t of any offence shall be compelled to be  a  witness\nagainst\t himself.

He\t was\ncharged with offences under the Sea Customs Act.  During the\ntrial,\treliance was placed on his  confessional  statements\nmade  before the Customs Authorities, which was objected  to\non  the ground that the same were inadmissible\tin  evidence\ninter  alia  in\t view of the provisions\t of  <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_36\">Article  20(3).</a>\nWhile  rejecting the objection, the Supreme Court held\tthat\nin  order that the guarantee against testimonial  compulsion\nincorporated in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 20(3)</a> may be claimed by a person, it\nhas  to\t be established that when he made the  statement  in\nquestion,  he was a person accused of an offence.

The appellant  Ramanlal\t was\narrested on August 31, 1971 under <a href=\"/doc/27905/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 19B</a> of the Foreign\nExchange  (Regulation) Act, 1947, and the grounds of  arrest\nserved\ton  him\t included  the\taccusation  relating  to   a\ntransaction with reference to which he was summoned on April\n17, 1972 to appear before the Deputy Director,\tEnforcement,\nDirectorate  on\t April\t28,  1972  to  give  evidence.\t The\npetitioner pointed out that he was accused at the time\twhen\nhe was arrested of having committed an offence which was the\nsubject-  matter  of  the enquiry and  the  summons  should,\ntherefore,  be\twithdrawn.

Rejecting the prayer of the appellant\t for\nsetting aside the summons, the Court directed him to  appear\nbefore the  Deputy Director and answer such questions as did\nnot tend to incriminate him.  It is significant to note that\nthese  observations  permitting\t him  not  to  answer  self-\nincriminating questions were made only because the appellant\nwas held to be an accused on the relevant date.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">     9. Mr. Salve has, next, contended that the appellant is\nwithin his right to insist on the presence of his lawyer  on\nthe  basis of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.  He has  urged\nthat  by way of ensuring protection to his life and  liberty\nhe  is\tentitled to demand that\t he shall not be  asked\t any\nquestion  in  the  absence  of\this  lawyer.   The  argument\nproceeds  to suggest that although strictly the\t questioning\nby  the\t Revenue authorities does not  amount  to  custodial\ninterrogation,\t it  must  be  treated\tas  near   custodial\ninterrogation,\tand  if\t the same is continued\tfor  a\tlong\nperiod\tit  may\t amount\t to mental  third  degree.   It\t was\nsubmitted  by both Mr. Salve and Mr. Lalit that the  present\nissue  should be resolved only by applying the\t`just,\tfair\nand  reasonable test&#x27;, and Mr. Lalit further added that\t the\npoint  has  to\tbe decided in the light\t of  the  facts\t and\ncircumstances  obtaining in a particular case and a  general\nrule should not be laid down one way or the other. Mr. Salve\nurged\tthat  when  a  person  is  called  by  the   customs\nauthorities  to their office  or to any place away from\t his\nhouse,\tand is subjected to intensive interrogation  without\nthe  presence of somebody who can aid and advise him, he  is\nbound  to  get\tupset, which by itself amounts\tto  loss  of\nliberty.   Reference was made by the learned counsel to\t the\nminority  view\tin Re Groban : 352 US 330, 1 L\tde  2d\t376,\ndeclaring that it violates the the protection\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\t\t\t\t\t\t       255</span>\nguaranteed  by\tthe constitution for the State to  compel  a\nperson\tto appear alone before any law\tenforcement  officer\nand give testimony in secret against his will.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">     10.  We  are afraid the judgment of the  United  States\nSupreme\t Court\tin Re Grabon&#x27;s case : 352 US 330,  1  Lawyer\nEdition\t 2d 376; is of no assistance to the appellant.\t The\nmatter related to an investigation into the cause of a\tfire\nwhere the right to assistance of counsel to the witness\t was\ndenied,\t on the basis of a state statue.  In this  situation\nthe  witnesses\trefused to depose without  the\tpresence  of\ntheir counsel, and their refusal was treated as a  violation\nof  the\t provisions  of the statue, and they  were  sent  to\nprison.\t They filed an application for writ of habeas corpus\nwhich  on  dismissal came before the United  States  Supreme\nCourt.\t The question which was realised and  considered  by\nthe  Court  was whether the witnesses had  a  constitutional\nright\tto   the   assistance  of   counsel   during   their\ninterrogation as witness in the enquiry.  Reed, J., speaking\nfor three members of the Court, rejected the contention that\nthe witnesses had such a right.\t It was pointed out that the\npersons concerned were not accused and they could not  claim\nthe right available to an accused of being heard through his\nown  counsel.  Two other Judges concurred in this  view\t and\nthus  the majority judgment went against the plea of such  a\nclaim.\t It was observed that prosecution of  an  individual\ndiffers\t widely from investigation of incidents damaging  to\nthe  economy or dangerous to the public.  The enquiry  under\nconsideration was a proceeding to elicit facts on the  basis\nof  which  it could be determined whether the fire  was\t the\nresult of carelessness or design, and although it could lead\nto  arrest of any person against whom there  was  sufficient\nevidence  on which a charge of arson could be based, it\t was\nheld that the fact that the testimony of the witnesses might\nprovide basis of criminal charges against them did not\tmean\nthat  they were entitled to insist on the presence of  their\ncounsel.   The\tmajority decision in the case  supports\t the\nstand  of  the\trespondent, Union of India.   We  have\tgone\nthrough\t the minority view in the judgment of Black, J.\t and\nare  not impressed by the same.\t Mr. Salve has\trelied\tupon\nthe following observations from the judgment :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t &quot;Secret  inquisitions are dangerous  things  justly\n\t feared\t  by  free  men everywhere.   They  are\t the\n\t breeding  place  for arbitrary\t misuse\t of  offical\n\t power.\t They are often the beginning of tyranny  as\n\t well as indispensable instruments for its survival.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\t\t\t\t\t\t       256</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t Modern\t as  well as ancient history  bears  witness\n\t that  both innocent and guilty have been seized  by\n\t officers  of the state and whisked away for  secret\n\t interrogation\tor  worse until the  groundwork\t has\n\t been secretly laid for their inevitable conviction.\n\t While\tthe  labels applied to\tthis  practice\thave\n\t frequently  changed, the central idea wherever\t and\n\t whenever carried out remains  unchanging-extraction\n\t of  &quot;statements&quot;  by one means or another  from  an\n\t individual  by\t officers of the state while  he  is\n\t held incommunicado.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">     The  learned judge, accordingly expressed\this  dissent\nobserving  that to compel a person to answer questions at  a\nsecret interrogation when he is denied legal assistance\t and\nwhere  he  is  subject to  the\tuncontrolled  and  invisible\nexercise   of  power  by  government  officials,  would\t  be\nunconstitutional.   We\tdo  not share  the  apprehension  as\nexpressed above in the minority judgment in connection\twith\nenquiry\t and  investigation under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_56\">Customs Act</a>  ad  other\nsimilar\t statutes of our country.  There is no\tquestion  of\nwhisking  away the persons concerned in the cases before  us\nfor  secret interrogation, and there is no reason for us  to\nimpute the motive of preparing the groundwork of false cases\nfor securing conviction of innocent persons, to the officers\nof  the\t state\tduly engaged in\t performing  their  duty  of\nprevention  and detection of economic crimes and  recovering\nmisappropriate\t money\tjustly\tbelonging  to  the   public.\nReference  was also made to the observation in the  judgment\nin  Carlos  Garza  De  Luna, Appt., v.\tUnited\tStates\t:  1\nAmerican  Law  Reports 3d 969; setting\tout  the  historical\nbackground  of\tthe  right of silence of  an  accused  in  a\ncriminal  case.\t  Mr. Salve has relied upon the\t opinion  of\nWisdom,\t Circuit Judge, that the history of the\t development\nof  the right of silence is a history of aceretions, not  of\nan  avulsion  and the line of growth in the course  of\ttime\ndiscloses  the\texpanding conception of the  right  than  is\nrestricted  application.   The\tJudge  was  fair  enough  to\ndiscuss\t the  other  point of view  espoused  by  the  great\njurists\t of  both sides of Atlantic  before  expressing\t his\nopinion.   In any event we are not concerned with the  right\nof  an\taccused\t in a criminal case  and  the  decision\t is,\ntherefore, not relevant at all.\t The facts as emerging\tfrom\nthe judgment indicate that narcotics were thrown from a\t car\ncarrying  the two persons accused in the case.\tOne  of\t the\naccused\t persons testified at the trial and his\t counsel  in\nargument to the jury made adverse comments on the failure of\nthe  other  accused  to go to the witness  box.\t  The  first\naccused was acquitted and the second accused was  convicted.\nThe question\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\t\t\t\t\t\t       257</span>\nof  the\t right\tof  silence  of\t the  accused  came  up\t for\nconsideration  in this set up.\tIn the cases before  us\t the\npersons\t concerned  are not accused and we do not  find\t any\njustification  for  &quot;expanding&quot; the right  reserved  by\t the\nconstitution  of  India in favour of accused persons  to  be\nenjoyed by others.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">     11.  We do not find any force in the arguments  of\t Mr.\nSalve and Mr. Lalit that if a person is called away from his\nown  house and questioned in the atmosphere of\tthe  customs\noffice\twithout the assistance of his lawyer or his  friends\nhis constitutional right under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 21</a> is violated.\t The\nargument  proceeds  thus  : if the person  who\tis  used  to\ncertain comforts and convenience is asked to come by himself\nto  the\t Department  for answering question  it\t amounts  to\nmental\ttorture.  We are unable to agree.  It is  true\tthat\nlarge majority of persons  connected with illegal trade\t and\nevasion\t of  taxes and duties are in a\tposition  to  afford\nluxuries on lavish scale of which an honest ordinary citizen\nof  this country cannot dream of and they are surrounded  by\npersons similarly involved either directly or indirectly  in\nsuch pursuits.\tBut that cannot be a ground for holding that\nhe has a constitutional right to claim similar luxuries\t and\ncompany\t of  his choice. Mr. Salve was fair  enough  not  to\npursue his arguement with reference to the comfort part, but\ncontinued to maintain that the appellant is entitled to\t the\ncompany\t of his choice during the questioning.\tThe  purpose\nof  the enquiry under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_58\">Customs Act</a> and the other  similar\nstatutes  will be completely frustrated if the whims of\t the\npersons\t  in  possession  of  useful  information  for\t the\ndepartments  are  allowed  to prevail.\t For  achieving\t the\nobject of such an enquiry if the appropriate authorities  be\nof the view that such persons should be dissociated from the\natmosphere   and   the\tcompany\t of  persons   who   provide\nencouragement to them in adopting a non-cooperative attitude\nto  the machineries of law, there cannot be  any  legitimate\nobjection  in depriving them of such company.  The  relevant\nprovisions  of\tthe Constitution in this regard have  to  be\nconstrued  in  the spirit they were made  and  the  benefits\nthereunder  should  not be &quot;expanded&quot; to  favour  exploiters\nengaged\t in  tax evasion at the cost  of  public  exchequer.\nApplying  the `just, fair and reasonable test&#x27; we hold\tthat\nthere in no merit in the stand of appellant before us.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">     1.2.
