It  may be mentioned that the learned  1st  Class\nMagistrate   held  that\t sanction  was\tessential  for\t the\nprosecution  of\t Om  Prakash and as the same  had  not\tbeen\ngranted,  the prosecution was not maintainable.\t  This\tview\ndid not find acceptance at the hands of the learned Sessions\nJudge,\twhose  decision was affirmed by the  High  Court  of\nAllahabad.   The  charge  against him was that\tas  a  canal\naccountant  in a Divisional Engineer&#x27;s office  he  committed\ncriminal breach of trust of a certain sum of money.\nLal  Ramagovind Singh, the appellant in Criminal Appeal\t No.\n97  of 1955, was the Director of Agriculture in\t the  Indian\nState  of  Rewa\t and for the  offence  of  having  committed\ncriminal  breach  of trust of an amount of Rs.\t586/10/-  on\nDecember  4,  1948, he was prosecuted under<a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_24\"> s.\t409</a>  of\t the\nIndian\tPenal Code, on August 13, 1949, and  after  inquiry,\ncharges\t were  framed  against him  on\tFebruary  24,  1950,\nresulting in a judgment of conviction by the trial court  on\nSeptember  29, 1950, and a sentence of one  year&#x27;s  rigorous\nimprisonment  and  a  fine of Rs. 500.\tHis  appeal  to\t the\nSessions  Judge was dismissed on September 29,1951, and\t the\nrevision  to the Judicial Commissioner shared the same\tfate\non  January 16, 1952.  Special leave having been granted  to\nhim, Criminal Appeal No. 97 of 10-55 was the outcome.\nThe first question for consideration is whethers. 409 of the\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_25\">Indian Penal Code</a>, in so far as it applies to\t  a   public\nservant\t (in this case the three appellants were  admittedly\npublic servants), has been impliedly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\t\t\t    427</span>\nrepealed by the enactment of<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_26\"> ss. 5 (1) (c)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1420677/\" id=\"a_27\">5 (2)</a> of\t the\nPrevention of Corruption Act II of 1947, and if &#x27;that is so,\nwhether\t a prosecution of the appellants for an\t offence  of\ncriminal breach of trust without the requisite sanction\t and\nwithout\t conforming to the provisions of the  <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_28\">Prevention  of\nCorruption  Act</a>,  can  be  legally  sustained.\t Two   other\nquestions  have\t also  been urged before us  and  they\tare:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">Assuming  that there was no such implied repeal,  would\t the\napplication  of<a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_29\"> s. 409</a> of the Indian Penal Code to a  public\nservant\t infringe <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_30\">Art. 14</a> of the Constitution, now that\t the\nprovisions  of\tthe  <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_31\">Prevention of Corruption  Act</a>  and\t the\nprocedure laid down thereunder are available to deal with  a\nbreach\tof  trust  by a public servant; &#x27;and  next,  if\t the\nappellants  do not succeed on the first two points,  whether\nthe  provision\tfor sanction required by the  <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_32\">Prevention  of\nCorruption  Act</a> would also similarly apply to a\t prosecution\nunder<a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_33\"> s. 409</a> of the Indian Penal Code.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">What  is  first to be determined is whether<a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_34\"> s.\t409</a>  of\t the\nIndian\tPenal  Code,  deals with the same  offence  as\tthat\ncontemplated under<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_35\"> ss. 5(1)(c)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1420677/\" id=\"a_36\">5(2)</a> of the Prevention of\nCorruption Act, and if so, has there been an overlapping  of\nlegislation  over  the same field; and has  the\t latter\t one\nimpliedly  repealed  the  earlier.   For  that\tpurpose\t the\nprovisions  of\tthe  two  statutes  have  to  be  succinctly\nanalysed to understand the full scope and the import of\t the\ntwo.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">The fasciculus of sections contained in Chapter XVII of\t the\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_37\">Indian Penal Code</a> beginning with<a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_38\"> s. 405</a> of the Indian  Penal\nCode  and ending with <a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_39\">section 409</a> of the Indian\t Penal\tCode\ndeals  with  criminal breach of trust.\t<a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 405</a>  of\t the\nIndian\tPenal Code defines criminal breach of trust  and  s.\n409  of\t the  -<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_41\">Indian Penal Code</a> is an\taggravated  form  of\ncriminal  breach  of trust when the same is committed  by  a\npublic servant, banker, merchant, etc.\tAnalysing<a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_42\"> s. 405</a>  of\nthe Indian Penal Code, into its component ingredients, it is\nseen that the following essential ingredients are absolutely\nnecessary to attract the operation of the section:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(i)  The accused must be entrusted with property or dominion\nover property;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">428</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(ii) The   person   so\tentrusted  must\t  (a,)\t dishonestly\nmisappropriate or convert to his own use that property, or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(b)  dishonestly use or dispose of that property or wilfully\nsuffer any other person to do so in violation\n(1)  of any direction of law prescribing the mode in which  such\ntrust is to be discharged, or\n(11) of\t any legal contract made touching the  discharge  of\nsuch trust.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">In the above cases he is said to commit a criminal breach of\ntrust.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\"><a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_43\">Section\t 409</a>  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  lays  down\t the\npunishment  when such criminal breach of trust is  committed\nby a public-servant, banker, merchant, etc.\nNow we have to ascertain the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_44\">Prevention of\nCorruption Act</a> dealing with criminal misconduct.\nThe  preamble of the Act makes it clear that  the  intention\nwas to make more effective provisions for the prevention  of\nbribery and corruption.\t From this itself, it is clear\tthat\nthe  legislature was alive to the fact that  something\tmore\nstringent  and drastic than<a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_45\"> s. 409</a> of the Indian Penal\tCode\nwas  necessary\tin  the case of bribery\t and  corruption  by\nPublic servants and it was to effectuate that intention that\nthe  Act was put on the statute book.  The duration of\tthis\npiece  of legislation in the first instance was only  for  a\nperiod\tof five years which later on was extended by Act  II\nof  1952 for ten years which would mean\t that  automatically\nthe Act would expire by about the middle of 1957.\n<a href=\"/doc/581728/\" id=\"a_46\">Section\t 3</a>  lays down that offences under<a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_47\"> ss. 161</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/126359453/\" id=\"a_48\">165</a>\t and\n<a href=\"/doc/54942699/\" id=\"a_49\">165-A</a> of the Indian Penal Code which under the provisions of\nthe  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_50\">Criminal  Procedure Code</a> were not cognizable  are\tmade\ncognizable.   <a href=\"/doc/616856/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 5</a> enacts that where a  public  servant\naccepts, agrees to or obtains gratification other than legal\nremuneration, then it shall be presumed unless the  contrary\nis proved, that he accepted, obtained or agreed to accept or\nattempted to obtain that gratification or valuable thing  as\na  &#x27;motive or reward such as is mentioned in  ,section\t161,\netc., etc.  Sub-<a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_52\">section 2</a> of s. 4 also deals\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\t\t\t    429</span>\nwith  this presumption.\t We are concerned in  these  appeals\nwith  s. 5. Sub-sections I (a) and 1 (b) of<a href=\"/doc/616856/\" id=\"a_53\"> s. 5</a>,  which  is\ndesignated  as criminal misconduct in discharge of  official\nduty  by a public servant, deal with persons who  habitually\naccept or obtain or agree to obtain gratification other than\nlegal remuneration as a motive or reward as mentioned in  s.\n161 of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_54\">Indian Penal Code</a>.  It is -not necessary to\tdeal\nwith  these  two subclauses in detail because  there  is  no\nquestion  of any acceptance of illegal gratification in\t the\npresent\t cases\tbut one thing that has to be  remembered  is\nthat  these  sub-sections deal with habitual  acceptance  or\nobtaining,  etc., whereas ss. 161 and 165 deal with  even  a\nsingle\tacceptance or obtaining.  The result is\t that  under<a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_55\">\nss.  161</a> and <a href=\"/doc/126359453/\" id=\"a_56\">165</a> of the Indian Penal Code a prosecution\t can\nbe  laid even in the case of a single act by which a  public\nservant has accepted an illegal gratification, but in  order\nto  attract  cls.  5 (1) (a) and 5(1)  (b),  there  must  be\nhabitual  commission  of the crime.  Any stray or  a  single\ninstance would not suffice to bring within the ambit of\t the\nsection\t the offence as contemplated in<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_57\"> ss. 5 (1) (a)</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_58\">5\n(1)  (b)</a>.

Sub-section (3) is an  important\npiece  of legislation to the effect that where a  person  is\ncharged\t under<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_65\">\ts.  5(1)</a> and it is found  that\tthe  accused\nperson cannot satisfactorily\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">430</span>\naccount\t for  the  pecuniary  resources\t or  property\tdis-\nproportionate to his known sources of income, then  the fact\nthat  he has such extensive pecuniary resources or  property\nis sufficient to presume, until the contrary is proved, that\nthe accused person was guilty of criminal misconduct in\t the\ndischarge  of  his official duty and a conviction  for\tthat\noffence shall not be invalid by reason only that it is based\nsolely\ton such presumption.  It is clear,  therefore,\tthat\nwhere a person is charged with criminal misconduct and it is\nseen  that he is in possession of property or  income  which\ncould  not  have  been amassed or  earned  by  the  official\nremuneration  which  he\t had obtained,\tthen  the  court  is\nentitled to come to the conclusion that the amassing of such\nwealth\twas due to bribery or corruption and the  person  is\nguilty\tof  an\toffence\t of  criminal  misconduct.

It is  clear,\ntherefore,  that  whereas under<a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_130\"> s. 405</a> of the  Indian  Penal\nCode there are three essential ingredients to constitute the\noffence, each one of them being separate and distinct, in<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_131\"> s.\n5(1)(c)</a>\t there\tare only two.

The meaning  put  on  the\tword\n&#x27;allows&#x27;  would\t &#x27;certainly be different  from\tI  dishonest\nmisappropriation&#x27;  by the offender himself.  It may be\tthat\nthe  word  can mean allowing by negligence  or\twithout\t any\nvolition on the part of the offender.  It may also mean that\nthere  is  some\t kind of  positive  and\t tacit\tacquiescence\nnecessary to bring home the offence.  In any event, allowing\nother  persons so to do does not find a place in<a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_134\"> s.  405</a>  of\nthe Indian Penal Code though this section also\tcontemplates\n&quot;wilfully  suffering any other person so to do.\t &quot; There  is\nan essential difference between &quot; allowing &quot; a person and  &quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">wilfully suffering &quot; a person to do a certain thing.\n There can, therefore, be no doubt whatever that<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_135\"> s.  5(1)(c)</a>\nof  the Prevention of Corruption Act creates a\tnew  offence\ncalled\t&quot;criminal  misconduct&quot;\tand  cannot  by\t implication\ndisplace the offence under<a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_136\"> s. 405</a> of the Indian Penal  Code.\nIn  this connection it is useful to compare<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_137\"> ss. 5(1)(a)</a>\t and\n<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_138\">5(1)(b)</a>\t with<a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_139\"> ss. 161</a> and <a href=\"/doc/108500659/\" id=\"a_140\">162</a> of the Indian Penal Code.\t  As\nhas  already  been  referred  to,  these  two  sections\t are\naggravated forms of<a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_141\"> ss. 161</a> and <a href=\"/doc/108500659/\" id=\"a_142\">162</a> of the Indian Penal Code\nand the intention cannot be to abrogate the earlier\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">437</span>\noffence\t by  the  creation of the new  offence.\t  These\t two\noffences can co-exist and the one will not be considered  as\noverlapping  the other.\t A course of&#x27; conduct can be  proved\nwhen  a person is arraigned under<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_143\"> ss. 5(1)(a)</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_144\">5(1)(b)</a>,\nbut  such a course is impossible to be let in evidence\twhen\nan  offence under ss. 161 and 162 is being enquired into  or\ntried.\t Similarly there are a number of elements which\t can\nbe  proved  in\tan inquiry or trial under  s.  5(1)(c)\tthat\ncannot be let in by the prosecution when a person is charged\nfor an offence under<a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_145\"> s. 405</a> of the Indian Penal Code.  In<a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_146\"> s.\n405</a>  of\t the Indian Penal Code the  offender  must  wilfully\nsuffer\t another  person  to  misappropriate  the   property\nentrusted, but in<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_147\"> s. 5(1)(c)</a> if he allows another person  to\ndishonestly  or\t fraudulently  misappropriate  or  otherwise\nconvert\t for his own use any property so entrusted, then  it\nis an offence.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1628129\" id=\"span_24\">There is a vast difference between  wilfully\nsuffering  another and allowing a person to do a  particular\nthing  and in our view the word &quot;allows &quot; is much  wider  in\nits import.  Wilfully pre-supposes a conscious action, while\neven by negligence one can allow another to do a thing.\nIt  seems  to  us,  therefore, that  the  two  offences\t are\ndistinct and separate.\tThis is the view taken in  <a href=\"/doc/1628129/\" id=\"a_148\">Amarendra\nNath Roy v. The State</a> (supra) and we endorse the opinion  of\nthe  learned  Judges, expressed\t therein.   Our\t conclusion,\ntherefore, is that the -offence created under<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_149\"> s. 5(1)(c)</a>  of\nthe  Prevention of Corruption Act is distinct  and  separate\nfrom  the  one under<a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_150\"> s. 405</a> of the Indian  Penal  Code\tand,\ntherefore, there can be no question of<a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_151\"> s. 5(1)(c)</a>  repealing<a href=\"/doc/1249173/\" id=\"a_152\">\ns.  405</a>\t of  the Indian Penal Code.  If that  is  so,  then,\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_153\">article 14</a> of the Constitution can be no bar.\nThe  last  argument of Mr. Isaacs is that despite  the\tfact\nthat  the  prosecution is under<a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_154\"> s. 409</a> of the  Indian  Penal\nCode,  still  sanction to prosecute is necessary.</span>   Quite  a\nlarge body of case law in all the High Courts has held- that\na  public servant committing criminal breach of\t trust\tdoes\nnot normally act in his capacity as a public servant, see\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">438</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">(a)  The State v.
