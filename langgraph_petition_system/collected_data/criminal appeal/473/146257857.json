As per FSL report (Ex.P/52), no human blood\n\nwas found.     As per statement of Vijay (PW-1), the\n\nallegation against appellant No.1-Nagesh, appellant\n\nNo.5-Hukum, appellant No.6-Om and appellant No.7-\n\nHiralal is of causing lathi injury to him as well as Raja\n\nand Ajay which are simple in nature. Only omnibus\n\nallegation has been made against these four appellants.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                  16</span>\n\n\nSimilar is the statement of injured Vijay (PW-1), Raja\n\n(PW-2), Ajay (PW-3), Narendra (PW-4), Malla (PW-5)\n\nand Koyal (PW-6) who are independent prosecution\n\nwitnesses.     Narendra (PW-4) in para-6 and 7 of his\n\nstatement has deposed that he has seen that number of\n\npersons were armed with deadly weapon and lathi.\n\nWhen he came from his house, he saw that deceased-Jai\n\nwas lying on the field. Police Statement (Ex.D/4) of\n\nthis witness was recorded after 15-20 days from the date\n\nof incident.     Police Statement of Koyal (PW-6) was\n\nrecorded after 20 days from the date of incident. All the\n\nmaterial prosecution witnesses in their statement have\n\ndeposed that the complainant party and the appellants\n\nwere having inimical relations from the last two years.\n\nAgainst        appellant No.1-Nagesh, appellant No.5-\n\nHukum, appellant No.6-Om and appellant No.7-Hiralal\n\nthere is no direct allegation of causing fatal injury to the\n\ndeceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">21.   There is evidence on record to show that deceased\n\nwas attacked by Appellants-Jasram, Mohandas, Ateesh\n\nand Bhagwan who were armed with knife and sword.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                  17</span>\n\n\nThough Vijay (PW-1), Raja (PW-2) and Ajay (PW-3)\n\nwere related to the deceased, their evidence in respect of\n\nknife and sword is credible and trustworthy. Medical\n\nevidence of Dr. Rakesh Choukse (PW-9) and Dr. Umesh\n\nVyas (PW-10) corroborates the oral testimony of the\n\nprosecution witnesses. We are in agreement with the\n\nfindings of trial Court. We also do not find any fault\n\nwith the finding recorded by the trial Court that the\n\ndeath of Jai was caused due to the injury caused by\n\nJasram, Mohandas, Ateesh and Bhagwan.                They\n\nattacked the deceased with knife and sword and caused\n\nmultiple injuries by sharp and hard object which\n\nresulted in death. Appellants Nagesh, Hukum, Om and\n\nHiralal assisted them in committing the crime by\n\nsurrounding the deceased. However, the only question\n\nthat falls for our consideration is whether the appellants-\n\nNagesh, Hukum, Om and Hiralal are liable to be\n\npunished for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 302</a> of IPC.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">22.   After considering the submissions made by the\n\ncounsel for the appellants and scrutinising the material\n\non record, we are of the opinion that appellant No.1-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                 18</span>\n\n\nNagesh, appellant No.5-Hukum, appellant No.6-Om and\n\nappellant No.7-Hiralal are not liable to be convicted\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 302</a> of IPC. We are convinced that there\n\nwas neither prior concert nor common intention to form\n\nan unlawful assembly to commit murder. As we are\n\nconvinced that accused Jasram, Mohandas, Ateesh and\n\nBhagwan were responsible for death of Jai, we are of\n\nthe opinion that they are liable to be convicted and,\n\ntherefore, their conviction is maintained.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_37\">23.   There is murder of one by accused Jasram,\n\nMohandas, Ateesh and Bhagwan and injuries of three\n\npersons [Vijay (PW-1), Raja (PW-2) and Ajay (PW-3)]\n\nin the attack by appellant No.1-Nagesh, appellant No.5-\n\nHukum, appellant No.6-Om and appellant No.7-Hiralal.\n\nThe occurrence was a result of an enmity.    Appellant\n\nNo.1-Nagesh, appellant No.5-Hukum, appellant No.6-\n\nOm and appellant No.7-Hiralal have completed more\n\nthan 10 years of jail sentence. Thus, looking to the\n\ninflicted injuries caused by appellant No.1-Nagesh,\n\nappellant   No.5-Hukum,      appellant   No.6-Om   and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                19</span>\n\n\nappellant No.7-Hiralal, we are of the view that they are\n\nnot liable to be convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 302</a> of IPC.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_38\">24.   In the present case, appellant No.1-Nagesh,\n\nappellant   No.5-Hukum,     appellant   No.6-Om        and\n\nappellant    No.7-Hiralal     of    Criminal     Appeal\n\nNo.1389/2007 were the members of unlawful assembly.\n\nFrom the evidence of injured and eye witnesses, it is\n\nestablished that murder of deceased-Jai was committed\n\nby appellant No.2-Jasram, appellant No.3-Mohandas,\n\nappellant No.3-Mohandas, Appellant No.4-Ateesh of\n\nCriminal Appeal No.1389/2007 and appellant-Bhagwan\n\nof Criminal Appeal No.1318/2007. As common object\n\nof unlawful assembly to attack the complainant and\n\nothers is proved, considering the manner of attack and\n\nstick used in committing the crime, we are of the view\n\nthat appellant No.1-Nagesh, appellant No.5-Hukum,\n\nappellant No.6-Om and appellant No.7-Hiralal of\n\nCriminal Appeal No.1389/2007 are guilty of offence\n\nunder Sections 147, 148, 307/149 (on two counts),\n\n307/149 and 323/149 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_24\">IPC</a>.         They have already\n\nundergone a sentence of more than 10 years.            The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                               20</span>\n\n\nincident occurred in the year 2006 and that there is no\n\ncomplaint from either side about any further violence\n\nsince then, sentence limited to the period already\n\nundergone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">25.   In the result, conviction of appellant No.1-\n\nNagesh, appellant No.5-Hukum, appellant No.6-Om and\n\nappellant     No.7-Hiralal   of    Criminal     Appeal\n\nNo.1389/2007 under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 302</a> of IPC is modified as\n\nconviction under Sections 147, 148, 307/149 (on two\n\ncounts), 307/149 and 323/149 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_26\">IPC</a> and the sentence is\n\nreduced to the period already undergone and the appeal\n\nis partly allowed accordingly. The appellant No.5-\n\nHukum of Criminal Appeal No.1389/2007 is hereby\n\nordered to be set at liberty forthwith, if he is not\n\nrequired to be detained in connection with any other\n\ncase. Appellant No.1- Nagesh, appellant No.6-Om and\n\nappellant     No.7-Hiralal   of    Criminal     Appeal\n\nNo.1389/2007 are on bail, their bail bonds are hereby\n\ndischarged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">26.   In view of aforesaid discussion, the Criminal\n\nAppeal No.1389/2007 filed on behalf of appellant No.2-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                     21</span>\n\n\nJasram, appellant No.3-Mohandas, appellant No.4-\n\nAteesh and Criminal Appeal No.1318/2007 filed on\n\nbehalf of appellant-Bhagwan are hereby dismissed and\n\ntheir conviction is hereby maintained.</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">\n\n\n\n\n(P.K.
