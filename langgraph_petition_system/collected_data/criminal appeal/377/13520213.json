An agreement was reached on 19.09.2001\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                                                                           12</span>\n\n\n\n\nbetween      the    company      Tim     Tim    Far    East      Export       Trading\nCompany Private Limited and Yermal Fish Trading , wherein\nthe   complainant         has    supplied      beheaded      and      gutter    &#x27;Rani\nfish&#x27; to the accused company.                  The accused was paying the\namount through telegraphic transfer and under the terms of\nthe agreement, the complainant was to send the statement\nof accounts by fax for every 15 days.                              At the end of\nfishing season, i.e., on 04.06.2002, the complainant sent\nthe final statement, under which the accused was liable to\npay Rs.73,24,710-00 to the complainant.                          The accused had\ncalled the complainant to his company on 02.08.2002 to\nsettle the debt and at that time, the accused issued three\ncheques of the State Bank of India (1) bearing No.511693\ndated 14.08.2002 for Rs.20 lakhs, (2) bearing No.511694\ndated 05.09.2002 for Rs.15 lakhs and (3) bearing No.511695\ndated 17.09.2002 for Rs.20 lakhs.                     The accused on behalf\nof the company had undertaken to settle the balance amount\nof Rs.18,24,710/- during the next fishing season.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       It appears that the complainant presented the cheques\ndated 14.08.2002 for Rs.20 lakhs to the Corporation Bank\nand the said cheque was returned with endorsement “payment\nstopped” and “funds insufficient”.

By the impugned judgment, the High Court\naffirmed     the        conviction       of     accused-appellants             under\n<a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_48\">Section     138</a>    of     the    Negotiable         Instruments        Act,     1881\n(hereinafter       referred       to    as    the   &#x27;Act&#x27;     for    short)     and\nsentence     for    imprisonment          till      rising      of   the      Court.\nCompensation       of    Rs.5    lakhs       awarded   to     the    complainant\njointly by the accused under <a href=\"/doc/640437/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 357(3)</a> of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;Code&#x27; for\nshort) in default of payment of compensation to undergo\nSimple    Imprisonment          for    six    months   was      also    affirmed.\nHowever, the fine of Rs.5,000/- and in default of payment\nof   fine to further undergo Simple Imprisonment for thirty\ndays passed by the trial court was quashed and thereby the\nappeal was partly allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_41\">      As per the complainant, the accused have taken loan\nof Rs.5 lakhs from the complainant showing themselves as\noffice bearers of the Adiwasi Machua Samiti, Sirsida and\nissued joint cheques of Rs.5 lakhs on 15.07.2006, cheque\nwas presented for encashment but the same was dishonoured.\nThen notice under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 138</a> of the Act was served upon\nthe accused but they have failed to pay the amount of\ncheque, thereafter the complaint was filed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">      Before the trial court, the appellants-accused have\ntaken the defence that the alleged cheque was not duly\nrecovered but it was security of loan. After hearing both\nthe parties, judicial magistrate, First Class, District\nDhamtari,    Chhattisgarh,             convicted     the     accused-appellant\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">\f                                                                                16</span>\n\n\n\n\nand sentenced as aforementioned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">       The    conviction      and    sentence    was     upheld      by   the\nappellate court.         Challenging the judgment passed by the\nHigh Court and the appellate court, the accused-appellants\npreferred Criminal Revision No. 305 of 2012 wherein the\nimpugned order was passed by the High Court affirming the\nconviction and part of the sentence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_44\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"126644011\" id=\"span_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1322448\" id=\"span_46\">Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the\naccused      have     been    convicted    in    utter       violation     of\nmandatory     provisions      of    <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_51\">Section     138</a>    and    <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_52\">141</a>    of   the\nNegotiable          Instrument      Act.         According          to    the\naccused-appellant, their office President and Secretary of\nAdiwasi Machua Samiti, Sirsida issued the cheque on behalf\nof Adiwasi Machua Samiti, Sirsida.

It is to be borne in mind that <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 141</a> of\n      the Act is concerned with the offences by the\n      company.   It makes the other persons vicariously\n      liable for commission of an offence on the part of\n      the company. As has been stated by us earlier, the\n      vicarious   liability  gets   attracted  when   the\n      condition precedent <a href=\"/doc/1322448/\" id=\"a_58\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 141</a> of the\n      Act stands satisfied. There can be no dispute that\n      as the liability is penal in nature, a strict\n      construction of the provision would be necessitous\n      and, in a way, the warrant.</span>\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">\f                                                                                   17</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">   …................................\n   …................................\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">   58.    Applying    the     doctrine    of     strict\n   construction, we are of the considered opinion that\n   commission of offence by the company is an express\n   condition precedent to attract the vicarious\n   liability of others. Thus, the words “as well as\n   the company” appearing in the section make it\n   absolutely unmistakably clear that when the company\n   can be prosecuted, then only the persons mentioned\n   in the other categories could be vicariously liable\n   for the offence subject to the averments in the\n   petition and proof thereof.         One cannot be\n   oblivious of the fact that the company is a\n   juristic person and it has its own respectability.\n   If a finding is recorded against it, it would\n   create a concavity in its reputation. There can be\n   situations   when  the   corporate   reputation   is\n   affected when a Director is indicted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">   59.    In view of our aforesaid analysis, we arrive\n   at the irresistible conclusion that for maintaining\n   the prosecution under <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 141</a> of the Act,\n   arraigning   of  a   company  as   an   accused  is\n   imperative. The other categories of offenders can\n   only be brought in the drag-net on the touchstone\n   of vicarious liability as the same has been\n   stipulated in the provision itself. We say so on\n   the basis of the <a href=\"/doc/1322448/\" id=\"a_61\">ratio <a href=\"/doc/1322448/\" id=\"a_62\">laid down in</a></a> C.V. Parekh\n   which is a three-Judge Bench decision.    Thus, the\n   view expressed in Sheoratan Agarwal        does not\n   correctly lay down the law and, accordingly, is\n   hereby overruled.    The decision in Anil Hada is\n   overruled with the qualifier as stated in para 51.\n   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1322448\" id=\"span_50\">The decision in Modi Distillery has to be treated\n   to be restricted to its own facts as has been\n   explained by us hereinabove.”\n\n        Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent\nwhile    accepting   that     Adiwasi    Machua        Samiti,      Sirsida   on\nwhose    behalf   cheque     was    issued       was    not       impleaded   as\naccused before the trial court, contended that judgment in\n<a href=\"/doc/1322448/\" id=\"a_63\">Aneeta      Hada</a>&#x27;s     case        cannot        be     made         applicable\nretrospectively in respect of cases where the conviction\ntook place much prior to the judgment.
