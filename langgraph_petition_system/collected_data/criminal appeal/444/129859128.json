Thereafter, all accused persons went\n    5          Criminal Appeal Nos. 1049 of 2011, 102 of 2012 and 160 of 2012\n\nfrom the place of occurrence by giving a threat to complainant Deepak\n\nChaurasiya to kill him. Thereafter, in the afternoon of 09-04-2006\n\naccused Ashish, Ghanshyam and Ramprakash came to the house of old\n\nlady Ramrati and beaten her and this fact was narrated by Ramrati to\n\nMahesh Chaurasiya, uncle of the complainant. Again, accused Ashish and\n\nRamprakash came to handcart shop of Mahesh Chaurasiya and some hot\n\ntalks took place there and thereafter, went from there by giving a threat to\n\nkill him. On the same day, at around 07:30 pm, complainant Deepak\n\nChaurasiya, his uncle Mahesh Chaurasiya and brother Arjun were\n\nstanding on the said shop, all accused persons come there on Suzuki\n\nmotorcycle. Accused Ravi, Ashish and Rakesh were armed with katta and\n\nthereafter, surrounded the uncle of complainant Mahesh Chaurasiya and\n\non the exhortation of accused Ramprakash, accused Rakesh caused a\n\ngunshot fire from his Katta on the head of Mahesh Chaurasiya and at the\n\nsame time, when other uncle of complainant Munnalal Chaurasiya who\n\nwas doing Chowkidar at the shop of one Ratanlal, also came there for\n\nrescue, then accused Ashish fired a gunshot from his katta which hit on\n\nthe chest of Munnalal Chaurasiya as a result of which, he fell down on the\n\nground. When they tried to caught hold of the accused, accused Ravi also\n\ncaused gunshot fire but they saved themselves. Both Mehesh Chaurasiya\n       6          Criminal Appeal Nos. 1049 of 2011, 102 of 2012 and 160 of 2012\n\nand Munnalal Chaurasiya died on the spot due to gunshot injuries\n\nsustained by them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">(4)       On the basis of Dehati Nalishi recorded at Crime No.06 of 2006\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_11\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_12\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_13\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_14\">302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_15\">109</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1075683/\" id=\"a_16\">115</a> of IPC and under <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_17\">Section\n\n25</a>/<a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_18\">27</a> of Arms Act, FIR was got registered at Crime No.33 of 2006 and\n\nafter completion of investigation and other formalities, the police filed\n\ncharge sheet before the Court from where the case was committed to the\n\ntrial Court for its trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">(5)       Charges were framed and read over against the accused who denied\n\nthe charges and they abjured their guilt and pleaded complete innocence.\n\nStatement of accused were recorded under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 313</a> of CrPC. In their\n\ndefence, they did not examine any witness. Prosecution, in order to\n\nsupport its case, examined as many as 18 witnesses. After conclusion of\n\ntrial, the Trial Court by the impugned judgment, convicted and sentenced\n\nthe appellants for aforesaid offences as mentioned in para 2 of this\n\njudgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">(6)       It is submitted on behalf of appellants that the impugned judgment\n\npassed by trial Court suffers gross error of law. The trial Court did not\n\nconsider properly Dehati Nalishi recorded by complainant Deepak\n\nChaurasiya (PW4) as the complainant did not support the prosecution\n       7          Criminal Appeal Nos. 1049 of 2011, 102 of 2012 and 160 of 2012\n\ncase and only on the basis of statements of hearsay witnesses, appellants\n\ncannot be convicted. There are major contradictions and omissions in the\n\nevidence of witnesses but trial Court has failed in considering the same.\n\nMerely on the basis of presence of appellants on the place of occurrence,\n\nit cannot be presumed that they were unlawfully assembled and with\n\ncommon object caused gunshot fires at deceased. Therefore, no offence\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 149</a> of IPC for which appellants can be convicted under\n\nSection 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 149</a> of IPC. Neither there is any overt act\n\non the part of appellants nor there is any active participation of appellants\n\nfor committing murder of both the deceased. Therefore, the impugned\n\njudgment passed by trial Court is bad in law as well as against the settled\n\nprinciple of law and the same is unsustainable in the eyes of law. The trial\n\nCourt has not properly evaluated and appreciated                the prosecution\n\nevidence and has wrongly convicted and sentenced                appellants vide\n\nimpugned judgment, which deserves to be set aside and                 appellants\n\ndeserves acquittal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">(7)       In response, Counsel for the State supported impugned judgment\n\nand submitted that there being no infirmity in passing the impugned\n\njudgment of conviction and sentence and the findings arrived at by the\n\nTrial Court do not require any inference by this Court. It is further\n       8          Criminal Appeal Nos. 1049 of 2011, 102 of 2012 and 160 of 2012\n\nsubmitted that although incident in question took place on a pity dispute,\n\nbut appellants unlawfully assembled the place of occurrence and with\n\ncommon object committed murder of both the deceased by means of\n\nfirearms. Hence, no interference is warranted in the impugned judgment\n\nby this Court. Therefore, both the criminal appeals deserve dismissal.\n\n(8)       Before adverting to the merits of the case, it would be appropriate\n\nto throw light on the relevant provisions of <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_22\">Sections 299</a> and <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_23\">300</a> of\n\nIndian Penal Code.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">           The Law Commission of United Kingdom in its 11th Report\n\nproposed the following test :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                &quot;The standard test of &#x27;knowledge&#x27; is, Did the person\n          whose conduct is in issue, either knows of the relevant\n          circumstances or has no substantial doubt of their existence?&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">          [See Text Book of Criminal Law by Glanville Wiliams (p.125)]\n\n          &quot;Therefore, having regard to the meaning assigned in criminal law\n\nthe word &quot;knowledge&quot; occurring in clause Secondly of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 300</a> IPC\n\nimports some kind of certainty and not merely a probability.\n\nConsequently, it cannot be held that the appellant caused the injury with\n\nthe intention of causing such bodily injury as the appellant knew to be\n\nlikely to cause the death of deceased. So, clause Secondly of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 300</a>\n\nIPC will also not apply.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">          The enquiry is then limited to the question whether the offence is\n       9          Criminal Appeal Nos. 1049 of 2011, 102 of 2012 and 160 of 2012\n\ncovered by clause Thirdly of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 300</a> IPC. This clause, namely, clause\n\nThirdly of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 300</a> IPC reads as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                  &#x27;&#x27;Culpable homicide is murder, if the act by which\n           the death is caused is done with the intention of causing\n           bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended\n           to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature\n           to cause death.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(9)        The argument that the accused had no intention to cause death is\n\nwholly fallacious for judging the scope of clause Thirdly of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 300</a>\n\nIPC as the words &quot;intention of causing death&quot; occur in clause Firstly and\n\nnot in clause Thirdly. An offence would still fall within clause Thirdly\n\neven though the offender did not intend to cause death so long as the\n\ndeath ensues from the intentional bodily injury and the injuries are\n\nsufficient to cause death of the deceased in the ordinary course of nature.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">This is also borne out from illustration (c) to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 300</a> IPC which is\n\nbeing reproduced below:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                   &quot;(c) A intentionally gives Z a sword-cut or club-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">            wound sufficient to cause the death of a man in the\n            ordinary course of nature.

State\n\nof Punjab</a> AIR 1958 SC 465 and the principle enunciated therein\n\nexplains the legal position succinctly. The accused Virsa Singh was\n\nalleged to have given a single spear blow and the injury sustained by the\n\ndeceased was &quot;a punctured wound 2&quot;x =&quot; transverse in direction on the\n\nleft side of the abdominal wall in the lower part of the iliac region just\n\nabove the inguinal canal. Three coils of intestines were coming out of the\n\nwound.&quot; After analysis of the clause Thirdly, it was held: -</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">              &quot;The prosecution must prove the following facts before it\n       can bring a case under S. 300 &quot;Thirdly&quot;; First, it must establish,\n       quite objectively, that a bodily injury is present; Secondly, the\n       nature of the injury must be proved. These are purely objective\n       investigations. Thirdly, it must be proved that there was an\n       intention to inflict that particular bodily injury, that is to say,\n       that it was not accidental or unintentional, or that some other\n       kind of injury was intended.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       Once these three elements are proved to be present, the enquiry\n\nproceeds further and, Fourthly, it must be proved that the injury of the\n\ntype, just described, made up of the three elements set out above, is\n\nsufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature. This part of the\n\nenquiry is purely objective and inferential and has nothing to do with the\n\nintention of the offender. Once these four elements are established by the\n\nprosecution (and, of course, the burden is on the prosecution throughout),\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">   11           Criminal Appeal Nos. 1049 of 2011, 102 of 2012 and 160 of 2012\n\nthe offence is murder under S. 300 &quot;Thirdly&quot;. It does not matter that there\n\nwas no intention to cause death, or that there was no intention even to\n\ncause an injury of a kind that is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary\n\ncourse of nature (there is no real distinction between the two), or even\n\nthat there is no knowledge that an act of that kind will be likely to cause\n\ndeath. Once the intention to cause the bodily injury actually found to be\n\npresent is proved, the rest of the enquiry is purely objective and the only\n\nquestion is whether, as a matter of purely objective inference, the injury is\n\nsufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death.&quot;\n\n(11)   In the case of Arun Nivalaji More vs. State of Maharashtra\n\n(Case No.Appeal (Cri.) 1078-1079 of 2005), it has been observed as\n\nunder :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">               &quot;11. First it has to be seen whether the offence falls\n       within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 299</a> IPC. If the offence falls under\n       <a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 299</a> IPC, a further enquiry has to be made whether it\n       falls in any of the clauses, namely, clauses &#x27;Firstly&#x27; to &#x27;Fourthly&#x27;\n       of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 300</a> IPC.

Intention and knowledge commonly go together,\n          for he who intends a result usually knows that it will follow,\n          and he who knows the consequences of his act usually\n          intends them.

Conversely, there may be knowledge\n          without intention, the consequence being foreknown as the\n          inevitable concomitant of that which is desired, but being\n          itself an object of repugnance rather than desire, and\n          therefore not intended.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">       In Blackstone&#x27;s Criminal Practice the import of the word &#x27;knowledge&#x27;\n\nhas been described as under: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">               &#x27;Knowledge&#x27; can be seen in many ways as playing the\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">   14           Criminal Appeal Nos. 1049 of 2011, 102 of 2012 and 160 of 2012\n\n        same role in relation to circumstances as intention plays in\n        relation to consequences.

The said exception deals with a case\n          of prosecution not covered by the first exception, after\n          which its place would have been more appropriate. The\n          exception is founded upon the same principle, for in both\n          there is absence of premeditation. But, while in the case of\n          Exception 1 there is total deprivation of self-control, in case\n 19         Criminal Appeal Nos. 1049 of 2011, 102 of 2012 and 160 of 2012\n\n     of Exception 4, there is only that heat of passion which\n     clouds men&#x27;s sober reason and urges them to deeds which\n     they would not otherwise do. There is provocation in\n     Exception 4 as in Exception 1; but the injury done is not the\n     direct consequence of that provocation. In fact Exception 4\n     deals with cases in which notwithstanding that a blow may\n     have been struck, or some provocation given in the origin of\n     the dispute or in whatever way the quarrel may have\n     originated, yet the subsequent conduct of both parties puts\n     them in respect of guilt upon equal footing. A &#x27;sudden fight&#x27;\n     implies mutual provocation and blows on each side. The\n     homicide committed is then clearly not traceable to\n     unilateral provocation, nor in such cases could the whole\n     blame be placed on one side. For if it were so, the Exception\n     more appropriately applicable would be Exception 1. There\n     is no previous deliberation or determination to fight. A fight\n     suddenly takes place, for which both parties are more or less\n     to be blamed. It may be that one of them starts it, but if the\n     other had not aggravated it by his own conduct it would not\n     have taken the serious turn it did. There is then mutual\n     provocation and aggravation, and it is difficult to apportion\n     the share of blame which attaches to each fighter. The help\n     of Exception 4 can be invoked if death is caused (a) without\n     premeditation, (b) in a sudden fight; (c) without the\n     offender&#x27;s having taken undue advantage or acted in a cruel\n     or unusual manner; and (d) the fight must have been with\n     the person killed. To bring a case within Exception 4 all the\n     ingredients mentioned in it must be found. It is to be noted\n     that the &#x27;fight&#x27; occurring in Exception 4 to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 300</a>, IPC\n     is not defined in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_70\">IPC</a>. It takes two to make a fight. Heat\n     of passion requires that there must be no time for the\n     passions to cool down and in this case, the parties have\n     worked themselves into a fury on account of the verbal\n     altercation in the beginning. A fight is a combat between two\n     and more persons whether with or without weapons. It is not\n     possible to enunciate any general rule as to what shall be\n     deemed to be a sudden quarrel. It is a question of fact and\n     whether a quarrel is sudden or not must necessarily depend\n     upon the proved facts of each case. For the application of\n     Exception 4, it is not sufficient to show that there was a\n   20           Criminal Appeal Nos. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1173740\" id=\"span_5\">1049 of 2011, 102 of 2012 and 160 of 2012\n\n        sudden quarrel and there was no premeditation.

Many petty or insignificant matters plucking\n        of a fruit, straying of a cattle, quarrel of children, utterance of\n        a rude word or even an objectionable glance, may lead to\n        altercations and group clashes culminating in deaths.

Here, the appellant had chosen a\n        crowbar as the weapon of offence. He has further chosen a\n        vital part of the body i.e. the head for causing the injury\n        which had caused multiple fractures of skull. This clearly\n        shows the force with which the appellant had used the\n        weapon.

The nature of offence where there is a\n        single injury could not be decided merely on the basis of the\n        single injury and thus in a mechanical fashion. The nature of\n        the offence would certainly depend upon the other attendant\n        circumstances which would help the court to find out\n        definitely about the intention on the part of the accused. Such\n        attendant circumstances could be very many, they being (i)\n        whether the act was premeditated; (ii) the nature of weapon\n        used; (iii) the nature of assault on the accused. This is\n        certainly not an exhaustive list and every case has to\n        necessarily depend upon the evidence available.

The question is not whether the prisoner intended to\n     inflict a serious injury or a trivial one but whether he intended\n     to inflict the injury that is proved to be present. If he can show\n     that he did not, or if the totality of the circumstances justify\n     such an inference, then, of course, the intent that the section\n     requires is not proved. But if there is nothing beyond the\n     injury and the fact that the appellant inflicted it, the only\n     possible inference is that he intended to inflict it. Whether he\n     knew of its seriousness, or intended serious consequences, is\n     neither here nor there. The question, so far as the intention is\n     concerned, is not whether he intended to kill, or to inflict an\n     injury of a particular degree of seriousness, but whether he\n     intended to inflict the injury in question; and once the\n     existence of the injury is proved the intention to cause it will\n     be presumed unless the evidence or the circumstances warrant\n     an opposite conclusion. But whether the intention is there or\n     not is one of fact and not one of law. Whether the wound is\n     serious or otherwise, and if serious, how serious, is a totally\n     separate and distinct question and has nothing to do with the\n     question whether the prisoner intended to inflict the injury in\n     question....</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">          It is true that in a given case the enquiry may be linked up\n     with the seriousness of the injury. For example, if it can be\n     proved, or if the totality of the circumstances justify an\n     inference, that the prisoner only intended a superficial scratch\n     and that by accident his victim stumbled and fell on the sword\n     or spear that was used, then of course the offence is not\n     murder. But that is not because the prisoner did not intend the\n     injury that he intended to inflict to be as serious as it turned\n    25            Criminal Appeal Nos. 1049 of 2011, 102 of 2012 and 160 of 2012\n\n           out to be but because he did not intend to inflict the injury in\n           question at all.

The aforesaid contention raised\n\nby counsel for the appellants has no force as on the alleged date of\n\nincident, on a pity dispute of committing &#x27;&#x27;marpeet&#x27;&#x27; with one old lady\n\nnamely, Ramrati by accused Ghanshyam, at the morning of 09-04-2006\n\naccused Rakesh, Ravi, Ashish, Santosh, Chandrabhan Yadav, Govind\n\nSingh, came and assaulted the complainant by giving a threat to kill him.\n\nThereafter, after some time, in the afternoon of 09-04-2006 accused\n\nAshish, Ghanshyam and Ramprakash came to house of old lady Ramrati\n\nand beaten her and this fact was narrated by Ramrati to the uncle of\n\ncomplainant Mahesh Chaurasiya.Again, accused Ashish and Ramprakash\n\ncame to handcart shop of Mahesh Chaurasiya where some hot talks took\n\nplace and thereafter, went from there by giving a threat to kill him. On the\n\nsame day, at around 07:30 pm, complainant Deepak Chaurasiya, his uncle\n\nMahesh Chaurasiya and brother Arjun were standing on the said shop, all\n\naccused persons came there on Suzuki motorcycle. Accused Ravi, Ashish\n\nand Rakesh armed with katta surrounded the uncle of complainant\n\nMahesh Chaurasiya and on the exhortation of accused Ramprakash,\n\naccused Rakesh caused a gunshot fire from his Katta on the head of\n\nMahesh Chaurasiya and at the same time, when uncle of complainant\n   42           Criminal Appeal Nos. 1049 of 2011, 102 of 2012 and 160 of 2012\n\nMunnalal Chaurasiya who was doing the Chowkidar at the shop of one\n\nRatanlal, also came there for rescue, then accused Ashish fired gunshot\n\nfrom his katta which hit at the chest of Munnalal Chaurasiya as a result of\n\nwhich, he fell down on the ground. When they tried to caught hold of the\n\naccused, accused Ravi also caused gunshot fire but they saved\n\nthemselves. Both Mahesh Chaurasiya and Munnalal Chaurasiya died on\n\nthe spot. As per opinion of doctor, the cause of death of deceased was the\n\nresult of firearm injuries on the head and on the right chest of Mahesh and\n\nMunnalal respectively and cause of death of both deceased seems to be\n\nhomicidal in nature but on the basis of circumstantial evidence, it appears\n\nthat the accused persons unlawfully assembled the spot and with common\n\nobject committed murder of both deceased by means of firearm.\n\n(51)   The next contention of learned counsel for the appellants that there\n\nis delay in lodging the FIR as well as investigation is concerned, the said\n\ncontention of the counsel for the appellants has no force as if there is any\n\ndelay in investigation that would not sufficient to discard the credible the\n\noral evidence of prosecution witnesses. The evidence of all the\n\nprosecution witnesses cannot be said to be totally false implication so that\n\naccused can be acquitted from the charges aforesaid.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"646234\" id=\"span_25\">In this regard, a\n\nreliance can be placed in the case of <a href=\"/doc/646234/\" id=\"a_117\">Jayaseelan vs. State of Tamil Nadu</a>,\n   43           Criminal Appeal Nos. 1049 of 2011, 102 of 2012 and 160 of 2012\n\nreported in (2009) 12 SCC 275.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">(52)   On going through the entire evidence available on record, this\n\nCourt is of the considered opinion that the learned trial Court has rightly\n\nconvicted and sentenced the present appellants-accused and                 the\n\nprosecution has rightly established the appellants guilty of aforesaid\n\noffences.
