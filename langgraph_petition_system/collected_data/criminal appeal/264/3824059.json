M.L.A.,     was\n\nreported to be missing by his son-PW1 after he went for\n\nhis morning walk on 30.12.2001. On the basis of the\n\ncomplaint,          law was      set in       motion. PW67-Inspector         of\n\nPolice, took over the investigation on 12.01.2002 from\n\nPW66. It was, in fact, PW66, who initially conducted\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                          3</span>\n\finvestigation. PW66 has spoken about information of the\n\nabsconding     person being      given to        the Police    Control\n\nRoom and to all Police Stations by wireless. He has\n\nsent photograph of absconding person to be published in\n\nthe    daily    newspapers.          Inquiry     was   conducted      in\n\nhospitals. He has examined a large number of witnesses.\n\nIt is, as noted, on 12.01.2002, further investigation\n\nwas taken over by PW67-Deputy Superintendent of CBCID.\n\nThe evidence of PW67 would show that from 13.01.2002,\n\nthe Officer has examined several witnesses. According\n\nto the prosecution, the breakthrough came on the basis\n\nof information, as per which, the A5 (fifth accused)\n\ncame to be arrested on 18.03.2002. On the very next\n\nday, A6 came to be arrested. Still, within the space of\n\ntwenty-four hours, viz., on 20.03.2002, A7 came to be\n\narrested.      A8   was   arrested         on   22.03.2003.    A1    was\n\narrested on 23.03.2002.         A3 was arrested on 25.03.2002.\n\nA4 came to be arrested on 09.04.2002. A15 was arrested\n\non    25.04.2002.   It    is   the       prosecution   case   that   the\n\naccused made confessional statements within the meaning\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                     4</span>\n\fof     <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_2\">Section   27</a>     of    the       Indian    Evidence      Act,   1872\n\n(hereinafter     referred to            as ‘the    <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_3\">Evidence Act</a>’,        for\n\nshort) yielding information leading to recoveries. It\n\nis the case of the prosecution that the deceased had\n\nbeen    abducted      (though     it    is    shown   as   kidnapped)    on\n\n30.01.2002, taken and kept in a factory premises which\n\nbelonged to PW34-Krishna Pandi with whom PW10 and PW11\n\nhad become partners. A huge sum, running into several\n\ncrores, motivated the accused to hatch the conspiracy\n\nto abduct the deceased. It was the further case of the\n\nprosecution that the accused decided to do away with\n\nthe deceased in case he did not yield to the demand. As\n\nit transpired as the deceased did not yield, he was\n\nmurdered while he was kept captive in the first floor\n\nof the vermicelli factory, which, as already noted, was\n\nbeing operated by PW34. A3 was noted as leader of the\n\nADMK. A12, it was alleged, who was married to the A2,\n\nwas made to speak in the voice of an AIADMK leader\n\nShashikala to A3. In this, the A1 and A2 played a role.\n\nIt   is,   according         to   the       prosecution,   on    being    so\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                        5</span>\n\fspurred     by    the        command       given   by    A12,      apparently\n\nmimicking the voice of the AIADMK leader, A3 acts. A9\n\ncontacted PW10 and PW11. It is alleged that PW10 and\n\nPW11 were persuaded to search for houses. Not satisfied\n\nwith    many     of    the    houses       shown   to   A3   and     A9,   they\n\nfinally found favour with the factory premises which is\n\nlocated in Mudichur. It is the further case of the\n\nprosecution that after he was murdered, the body of the\n\ndeceased       came     to     be    cremated      at    the      Corporation\n\ncremation       ground       on     01.01.2002      and,     in    order        to\n\naccomplish       the    same,       PW33-an    employee      working       in    a\n\nGovernment Hospital, was roped in by A3 to procure a\n\nfalse    death        certificate.         Accordingly,      PW33,    it    was\n\nalleged,    approached            PW32-a    Medical     Practitioner.       The\n\nMedical Practitioner gives a death certificate wherein\n\nthe name of a person is indicated in the certificate,\n\nand     allegedly       residing       at    an    address,       which,    the\n\nPolice, on investigation, found, was not the abode of\n\nthe person.

The High Court confirmed the judgment of the Trial\n\nCourt except as regards A10 who was acquitted.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">9.   We heard the learned Counsel for the appellants.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">10. We have also heard the learned Counsel appearing\n\nfor the respondent-State in all the appeals.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">11. Learned Counsel for A3 would submit that the case\n\nof   the    prosecution   was    based   on    the   theory   of\n\nconspiracy.    It is   accordingly that       the charge   under\n\nSection 120B was framed against the accused including\n\nA3. The case of the prosecution in this regard was,\n\nA12, who was married to A2, made phone calls to A3. A3\n\nwas told over phone by A12 allegedly in the voice of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                21</span>\n\fShashikala that A1 and A2 would meet A3 and he was\n\nasked to do what they would ask him to do. There were\n\nfurther calls. In fact, the conspiracy was, according\n\nto the prosecution, hatched in the minds of A1 and A2.\n\nA1 flaunted his proximity to M.K. Stalin (a political\n\nleader)      stating       that    he         was   about    to    marry     his\n\ndaughter.     A2    was    in     dire    financial         straits.    He   had\n\ncontracted an inter-religious marriage with A12. They\n\nhit upon the idea of abducting the deceased and to\n\ncompel him to part with a large sum of money (Rs.16\n\ncrores) and, in case he refused, to do away with him.\n\nIt is pointed out that the Trial Court has disbelieved\n\nthe   case     of    the    prosecution             relating      to   criminal\n\nconspiracy which culminated in the court acquitting A12\n\nof the charge against her. The appellant also stood\n\nacquitted under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 120B</a> of the IPC. The entire\n\nedifice   of       the    prosecution           case   was     built    on   the\n\nalleged criminal conspiracy which involved A12. Once\n\nthis edifice was knocked out by the acquittal of A12,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                         22</span>\n\fthe     superstructure      sought       to    be     built       by     the\n\nprosecution must necessarily fall to the ground.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_37\">12. Next, it is pointed out that the prosecution case\n\nis otherwise based on the testimony of PW10 and PW11.\n\nHe would point out that PW10 and PW11 were unreliable\n\nwitnesses.      It   is   clear   that        PW10    and     PW11     were\n\naccomplices. They were untrustworthy witnesses. It is\n\npointed out that it is settled law that the court would\n\nnot act on the deposition of accomplices unless they\n\nare     found    reliable     and,       furthermore,         there       is\n\ncorroboration of their testimony from other reliable\n\nevidence. Neither are PW10 and PW11 reliable nor is\n\nthere any corroborative evidence forthcoming in this\n\ncase, it is submitted. As far as conviction employing\n\n<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 109</a> of the IPC is concerned, learned Counsel\n\nsubmitted    that    in   order   that    <a href=\"/doc/1630403/\" id=\"a_134\">Section      109</a>    may      apply\n\napart    from    mere     conspiracy,     some       act     or   illegal\n\nomission in pursuance of the so-called conspiracy is\n\nindispensable. He would further submit that though V.\n\nK. Shashikala was interrogated by PW67-Officer, she has\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                  23</span>\n\fnot been examined as a witness. There is no evidence\n\nrelating to what her voice is. Unless the voice of\n\nShashikala        was    known   to    A12,    it   would   be   well-nigh\n\nimpossible to believe that the A12 could speak in her\n\nvoice to A3 which ultimately is what the prosecution\n\ncase is all about. There is no evidence of Shashikala\n\nhaving made a public speech. Though A3 may be familiar\n\nwith her voice being a party functionary, it hardly\n\nsuffices as there is no evidence to conclude that A12\n\nwas     familiar        with    her    voice    without     which   it    is\n\nincredible that she could mimic Shashikala.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_38\">13. He would further contend that in this case once the\n\nprosecution case relating to conspiracy under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_135\">Section\n\n120B</a> of the IPC failed, reliance placed on <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 109</a>\n\nof    the     IPC,      which    contemplates       a     conspiracy     and\n\nsomething more would have no legs to stand on. Leave\n\nalone       any    illegal       act    or     omission     based   on     a\n\nconspiracy, no conspiracy itself is proved. Therefore,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 109</a> of the IPC can have no play. Regarding the\n\nrecovery of Maruti Zen car at the instance of A3, it is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                       24</span>\n\fpointed out that A3 is not the owner of the car. PW10\n\nand     PW11    were    active       participants.         They       were    not\n\ntendered       pardon    under       Section       306    of    The    <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_138\">Code   of\n\nCriminal Procedure</a>, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as\n\n‘the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_139\">CrPC</a>’ for short). He would further contend that\n\nthe evidence of PW3 does not establish involvement of\n\nA3. PW3 has merely stated that at 05.30 A.M., he saw\n\nthree persons and that he was at the distance of 75\n\nmeters when he saw three persons pushing another person\n\ninto a Maruti Van. Evidence of PW1, who is the son of\n\nthe   deceased,        would    show        that    the   shoes       allegedly\n\nrecovered as was worn by the deceased, did not belong\n\nto his father. The case of abduction is not proved on\n\nthe basis of the evidence tendered by PW3. The Van,\n\nwhich    was    recovered,       has        not    been   identified.         The\n\nMotorcycle,       which        was    recovered,          again       was     not\n\nidentified.       The    recovery       was        also   not     proved,      he\n\ncontends. The prosecution has failed to prove that A3\n\nbrought the deceased to the factory. PW34, on whose\n\ntestimony prosecution has placed considerable reliance,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                       25</span>\n\fis also an accomplice. He drew our attention to the\n\njudgment2 of Justice Arun Mishra in paragraph 115, which\n\nreads as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">              “115. With   respect   to  charge   of\n          murder against A-3 and A-4 it is apparent\n          that MO 31 is in the handwriting of A-1.\n          It was read out by A-12 and heard by A-3\n          and was acted accordingly. Evidence of\n          Sahul Hameed, PW 47 also proves recovery\n          of chain with which M.K. Balan was tied\n          and that of other articles. It is apparent\n          that M.K. Balan was abducted. There was an\n          attempt to extract money when it was not\n          possible, he was murdered in factory\n          premises. The appellants were charged for\n          committing the murder by putting nylon\n          rope around his neck and tightening it.\n          Though there is no direct evidence with\n          respect to that but it can be inferred in\n          the circumstances that they committed the\n          offence of murder also. Once they had\n          abducted M.K. Balan it was for them to\n          explain how they dealt with him. The dead\n          body of M.K. Balan could not be found as\n          it was cremated in the name of a\n          fictitious person—Rajamani Chettiar. His\n          post-mortem also could not be conducted\n          but the evidence clearly indicates that\n          the dead body of M.K. Balan was taken from\n          the vermicelli factory. It gives an\n          inference that the accused persons had\n          murdered the victim. It is not necessary\n          for recording a conviction that corpus\n          delicti to be found. There is ample\n          evidence   leading   to   an   inescapable\n2 (2016) 16 SCC 355\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                            26</span>\n\f         conclusion that M.K. Balan was done to\n         death by the appellants. His dead body was\n         seen by the witnesses.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_40\">14. He complains that this approach involves shifting\n\nof the burden to be shouldered by the prosecution to\n\nthe   accused.    Since   abduction     itself     has     not    been\n\nproved, in order that the prosecution should succeed in\n\nthe matter of securing conviction under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 302</a> of\n\nthe IPC, the prosecution ought to have proved the case\n\nas set out by it. A chain was allegedly used to commit\n\nmurder of the deceased. A14 and A16 were in jail. The\n\nchain and the nylon rope were recovered on the basis of\n\nthe statements given by them. He would point out that\n\nhowever the said recoveries cannot be used against the\n\nother accused. He reminds the court of the backdrop in\n\nwhich the investigation proceeded following the missing\n\nof a high-profile person, as the deceased was an Ex-\n\nMLA. A Habeas Corpus Petition was filed in the Madras\n\nHigh Court. There was much pressure. The matter engaged\n\nthe   attention   of   the   media    also.   This       forced   the\n\nInvestigating     Officers   to      manufacture     the     version\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                               27</span>\n\findeed in order to cater to the general public. PW 21\n\nand PW35 are Police Officers. They are alleged to have\n\nidentified some of the accused as loitering in a public\n\nroad     after        midnight        on      01.01.2002,       which    was\n\nimmediately after the alleged commission of the crimes\n\nincluding murder. But this cannot result in conviction\n\nof A3. PW12 and PW19 are prosecution witnesses produced\n\nto prove the case under <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 201</a> of the IPC, viz.,\n\ndestruction      of    the     body      of    the   deceased    after   the\n\ncommission of the crime, PW12 and PW19 worked at the\n\ncremation ground. It is pointed out that as far as PW12\n\nis concerned, he has turned hostile. It is pointed out,\n\nin this regard, that the ashes were not recovered. The\n\nbones of the deceased person were not recovered or sent\n\nfor scientific investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">15. He    would       submit      that     the   body    of   the   deceased\n\nitself is not found or not produced, and therefore, the\n\ncase of the prosecution cannot be accepted. There is\n\nevidence to show that for a person above 60 years, a\n\ndeath    certificate         is     not       required    for   conducting\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                         28</span>\n\fcremation. This is the submission made in the context\n\nof evidence relied on by both the courts and also a\n\nlearned Single Judge of this Court to conclude that A3\n\nwas involved in procuring a false death certificate.\n\nAccording      to     the    prosecution,          PW32-Doctor       was\n\napproached     by   PW33    at   the    instance    of   A3.   It    was\n\nmentioned to the Doctor that another person had passed\n\naway. Believing PW33, PW32-Doctor has deposed that he\n\ngave a death certificate. According to PW19, the dead\n\nbody was cremated in the night on 01.01.2002. The death\n\ncertificate is, no doubt, dated 02.01.2002. [But what\n\nweighed with the courts is the role played by A3 in\n\nsetting   up   a    false   case   that    a   person,   other      than\n\ndeceased, involved in this case, had passed away and\n\nsecuring a death certificate which paved the way for\n\ncremation of the body of the deceased resulting in the\n\ndestruction of the evidence relating to the body of the\n\ndeceased].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_42\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                   29</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_43\">\f16.

Regarding     the    recovery       effected   from   A3,     it    is\n\npointed out that, MO12 is the Maruti Zen Car. He would\n\npoint out that the relevance of the recovery (apart\n\nfrom the infirmity attached with the recovery) is not\n\nestablished. MO28 are the audio cassettes. Regarding\n\nthe same, it is pointed out that it was incumbent upon\n\nthe prosecution to establish the content by providing\n\nthe   transcript.

Another circumstance sought to be\n          established was through the evidence of PW\n          4, a young girl living a few yards away\n          from the house of the deceased. According\n          to her, she heard the sound of somebody\n          running and when she turned, she saw\n          accused    Vijayan   running    away    after\n          crossing a water channel and wearing a\n          blue pant and blue shirt. It is no doubt\n          true that she identified accused Vijayan\n          in the test identification parade but for\n          the   reasons    already    advanced    while\n          discussing the evidence of PWs 3 and 9,\n          the identification of the accused in the\n          test   identification    parade   cannot   be\n          relied upon. The High Court unfortunately\n          appears to have taken a view that the\n          identification of the accused by PW 4 in\n          the test identification parade should be\n          relied upon. We are unable to agree with\n          this conclusion particularly when it is\n          apparent from the prosecution material\n          that much before the holding of the test\n          identification parade, the photograph of\n\n7 (1999) 3 SCC 54\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                             35</span>\n\f         the accused Vijayan had been published in\n         the newspaper and because of a certain\n         sensation in the locality, it had a lot of\n         publicity   and   there    was   sufficient\n         opportunity for the witnesses being shown\n         the accused person. In this view of the\n         matter, in our considered opinion, the\n         High Court erroneously interfered with the\n         conclusion of the learned Sessions Judge\n         in this regard and came to hold that the\n         identification of Vijayan by PW 4 could be\n         relied upon. We have examined the evidence\n         of the said PW 4 in great detail and we\n         are unable to subscribe to the view the\n         High Court has taken on the evidence of\n         the aforesaid witness. We also really fail\n         to understand how a witness seeing an\n         unknown man running away could be able to\n         identify him at a later point of time. No\n         special feature was also indicated by the\n         witness.

He would complain that the courts have relied\n\non PW10 and PW11 as if they were reliable witnesses,\n\nwhich they were not. He would also emphasise that being\n\naccomplices, they should not only be reliable but their\n\nevidence       must   stand    the    test     of     corroboration.       He\n\npoints out that the prosecution has tried to build up\n\nthe case that the said witnesses had not approached the\n\nPolice out of fear for their lives and that of their\n\nfamily members but he would point out that on a perusal\n\nof their evidence, it would be clear that they were\n\ninvolved with the matter right from the beginning and\n\nnothing        prevented    them      from     approaching         the    law\n\nenforcement       authorities.        Their        evidence,     therefore,\n\nshould    not    inspire      the   confidence        of   the   court.

In other words, he would point out\n\nthat    leave    alone       corroboration        from     other    evidence\n\navailable       on    record,       there    is   no     corroboration       of\n\nevidence of PW10 even from the evidence of PW11 as\n\ntheir    deposition         reveal     contradictions.

It is also contended\n\nthat PW67 was aware of the involvement of all and the\n\nevidence of PW10 and PW11 was unreliable.\n\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 1504 OF 2017\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_56\">26. Herein the appellant is A6. The learned Counsel for\n\nthe appellant would address the following submissions.\n\nHe would submit that there are four circumstances used\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                       39</span>\n\fagainst A6. It is first sought to be contended by the\n\nprosecution that A6 was seen on 05.12.2001. Next, his\n\npresence      on    31.12.2001      at     the    factory,     where     the\n\ndeceased was allegedly done to death, is used against\n\nhim. Still further, the deposition of PW10 that he saw\n\nhim on 01.01.2002 and that he threatened PW10, are used\n\nagainst him. He would also point out the contradiction\n\nbetween PW10 and PW11, in this regard. MO8 is the white\n\ncolour Maruti Van recovered at the instance of A6. The\n\nsaid vehicle bore Number - TN-22-BO/343. He would point\n\nout that there is no evidence to show that the said\n\nvehicle was used for abduction or transportation. He\n\nwould, in other words, question its very relevance to\n\nsecure conviction of his client. He would further point\n\nout that PW24-Police Officer has in fact identified A8\n\nas    A6.    In    this   regard,     he    drew    our      attention   to\n\nparagraph 147 of the Trial Court judgement. He further\n\nsubmitted that PW12-the employee at the crematorium,\n\ndid    not    identify      A6   though          PW19   identified       A6.\n\nIdentification       by   PW19   is      unreliable     as    he   did   not\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                    40</span>\n\fmention      about   physical       features     of    A6.    He    would\n\ncomplain that PW19 would have seen photographs in the\n\nmedia, a complaint which is being echoed on behalf of\n\nthe other accused, also. Next, the circumstance used\n\nagainst A6 is deposition of PW21 and PW35, Police Head\n\nConstable     and    Constable,     respectively.       He    would,      in\n\nfact, submit that even accepting their deposition, it\n\nwould prove nothing more than the fact A6 was there on\n\nthe public road on the midnight of 01.01.2002. It would\n\nnot connect A6 with the crime. He would further point\n\nout   that    the    deposition      of   PW35     would     show       that\n\ncontrary to the usual practice in the Beat Note, there\n\nis nothing noted about A6 though he has deposed that\n\nalong with three others, A6 presence was noted. The\n\nidentification       of   A6   by   the   Police      Officers     is   not\n\nreliable, it is contended. It is pointed out that the\n\nPolice Officer would have visited the jail and also\n\nbeen in the court premises where he would have seen A6.\n\nTherefore,     the    identification       of    A6    by    the    Police\n\nOfficers loses all meaning.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                    41</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_58\">\f27. He also relied on deposition of PW1 that the Reebok\n\nShoes did not belong to his father-the deceased. There\n\nis no corroboration of the evidence relating to the\n\npresence of A6 on 30.01.2001 and 31.01.2001. There is\n\nno    evidence   to   establish    the   presence   of   A6   on\n\n01.01.2002. PW10 and PW11, accomplices, were tutored by\n\nthe   Police Officers    considering the     pressure on      the\n\nInvestigating Officers consequent upon the fact that\n\nthe case attracted considerable publicity as a result\n\nof the Habeas Corpus Petition being filed in the High\n\nCourt. He would submit that PW67-Investigating Officer,\n\nafter the arrest of A5 on 18.03.2002, was completely\n\naware of involvement of all the persons.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">28. It is also the case of the appellant-A15 that no\n\nreliance could be placed on the recovery of the shoe\n\nwhen PW1-son of the deceased, has himself deposed that\n\nthe shoe which is recovered was not the one which was\n\nworn by his father. It is also the contention that PW31\n\nhas not been able to identify the person who took away\n\nallegedly the shoe from the factory.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_60\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                              42</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_61\">\f29. Per contra, the learned Counsel appearing on behalf\n\nof the State would begin by submitting that PW10 and\n\nPW11     were    not     accomplices.            Their     evidence      would,\n\ntherefore, not require corroboration. He tried to make\n\ngood    this    submission      by     pointing          out   that    qua    the\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 302</a> of the IPC, PW10 and PW11 had\n\nno     involvement      and    the     mere       fact     that   they       were\n\nfamiliar with the developments leading to the murder\n\nand    other    acts    of    the     accused,         they    could   not    be\n\ntreated as accomplices. He would point out, in fact,\n\nthat accused nos. 1 and 2, have been convicted under\n\nSection 120B read with 302 of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_162\">IPC</a>. He would draw\n\nconsiderable support from the deposition of PW34. He\n\nfurther submitted that A1 and A2 were the principal\n\nconspirators.          The    other         accused,       who    have       been\n\nconvicted under <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 109</a> of the IPC, have aided and\n\nconnived, within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 109</a> of the IPC,\n\nwith A1 and A2. He would submit that the acquittal of\n\nA12    would    have    no    impact        on   the     conviction     of   the\n\nappellants. He would point out that this Court, in the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                       43</span>\n\fcase of this nature, which is based on circumstantial\n\nevidence, what is to be looked into is the cumulative\n\neffect of all the circumstances put together. In regard\n\nto    any   defect   in   charge,        he    drew   our   attention   to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1319177/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 460</a> of the CrPC and contended that there is no\n\nincurable illegality involved in this case. He drew our\n\nattention to the deposition of PW60. He referred us to\n\nthe    recoveries    which   have        led    to    relevant   evidence\n\nbelieved in by two courts, and what is more, a learned\n\nSingle Judge of this Court. He would further point out\n\nto the deposition of PW19. He points out that both PW12\n\nand PW19 had made statements under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 164</a> of the\n\nCrPC. Statement under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 164</a> of the CrPC could be\n\nused for the purpose of corroborating though it could\n\nnot be used as a substantive evidence by itself. He\n\nalso drew considerable support from deposition of PW32\n\nread with PW33. The hand of A6 in the murder of a\n\npublic man is clearly made out, runs the argument. He\n\nfairly does not dispute the contention of A6 in regard\n\nto MOs 28 and 33. He assures the Court that the Court\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                    44</span>\n\fcan eschew the said items of evidence but he would\n\nsubmit that even dehors the same, there is sufficient\n\nmaterial before the Court to confirm the conviction of\n\nthe appellants. Learned Counsel for A3, in reply, would\n\npoint out that in fact, even A1 and A2 have also been\n\nconvicted with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 109</a> of the IPC. In\n\nother words, it is his case that even A1 and A2 are not\n\nthe principal actors so that the other accused could be\n\nconvicted      for   abetting     them.       They    were   themselves\n\nconvicted on the basis that they abetted the crimes in\n\nquestion. He further pointed out that PW10 and PW11\n\nhave   been    treated    as    accomplices      by    the   High   Court\n\ncontrary      to   what   is    sought   to    be     espoused   by   the\n\nlearned Counsel for the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">\nSECTIONS 120A, 107, 108, 109, 141 AND 149 OF THE IPC\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">30. <a href=\"/doc/591631/\" id=\"a_169\">Section        120A</a>    of     the    IPC     defines      “criminal\n\nconspiracy”, which reads as follows:\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                                   45</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">\f           “120A.

The\n        principal element in <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_183\">Section 34</a> of the\n        Indian Penal Code is the common intention\n        to commit a crime. In furtherance of the\n        common intention several acts may be done\n        by several persons resulting in the\n        commission of that crime. In such a\n        situation <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_184\">Section 34</a> provides that each\n        one of them would be liable for that crime\n        in the same manner as if all the acts\n        resulting in that crime had been done by\n        him alone. There is no question of common\n        intention in <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_185\">Section 149</a> of the Indian\n        Penal Code. An offence may be committed by\n        a member of an unlawful assembly and the\n        other members will be liable for that\n        offence although there was no common\n        intention between that person and other\n        members of the unlawful assembly to commit\n        that offence provided the conditions <a href=\"/doc/653650/\" id=\"a_186\">laid\n        down in</a> the section are fulfilled. Thus if\n        the offence committed by that person is in\n        prosecution of the common object of the\n        unlawful assembly or such as the members\n        of that assembly knew to be likely to be\n        committed in prosecution of the common\n        object, every member of the unlawful\n        assembly would be guilty of that offence,\n        although there may have been no common\n        intention and no participation by the\n        other members in the actual commission of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                          49</span>\n\fthat     offence.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"867186\" id=\"span_63\">In <a href=\"/doc/867186/\" id=\"a_187\">Barendra     Kumar\nGhosh v.

In the opinion\nof Lord Sumner, however, <a href=\"/doc/1060179/\" id=\"a_191\">Section 149</a> is\ncertainly not otiose, for in any case it\ncreated a specific offence.</span> It postulated\nan assembly of five or more persons having\na common object, as named in <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_192\">Section 141</a>\nof the Indian Penal Code and then the\ncommission of an offence by one member of\nit in prosecution of that object and he\nreferred to Queen v. Sabid Ali [(1873) XX\nWeekly Reporter (Cr), p 5]. He pointed out\nthat there was a difference between object\nand intention, for although the object may\nbe common, the intentions of the several\nmembers of the unlawful assembly may\ndiffer and indeed may be similar only in\nrespect that they are all unlawful, while\nthe element of participation in action,\nwhich is the leading feature of <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_193\">Section\n34</a>, was replaced in <a href=\"/doc/1060179/\" id=\"a_194\">Section 149</a> by\nmembership of the assembly at the time of\nthe committing of the offence. It was\nargued, however, that these observations\nof Lord Sumner were obiter dicta. Assuming\nthough not conceding that may be so, the\nobservations of a Judge of such eminence\nmust carry weight particularly if the\nobservations are in keeping with the\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_195\">Indian Penal Code</a>.

Thus, abetment of a thing is defined in <a href=\"/doc/1667403/\" id=\"a_207\">Section 107</a>\n\nof IPC and the concept of “abettor” is explained in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1494082/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 108</a> of the IPC. <a href=\"/doc/1667403/\" id=\"a_209\">Sections 107</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1494082/\" id=\"a_210\">108</a> of the IPC\n\nmust be read together to glean the intention of the Law\n\nGiver. So read, abetment can happen in three situations\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">(a)    It   may    happen   when       a       person   instigates     another\n\nperson to do the thing which is abetted; (b) Secondly,\n\nabetment takes place if a person engages with one or\n\nmore    other      person   or    persons         in    any   conspiracy      for\n\ndoing of that thing, if an act or illegal omission\n\ntakes place in pursuance of that conspiracy, and in\n\norder to the doing of that thing. Finally, there is\n\nabetment when a person intentionally aids, by an act or\n\nomission, the doing of that act. At this juncture, we\n\nmay    have   to    take    a    deeper         look    at    the   concept   of\n\nabetment      by    engaging      in       a    conspiracy      resulting      in\n\nabetment and conspiracy as provided in <a href=\"/doc/591631/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 120A</a> of\n\nthe IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                       56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">\f44. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1271682\" id=\"span_71\">In <a href=\"/doc/1271682/\" id=\"a_212\">Pramatha Nath Talukdar v.

When   the\n          agreement is to commit an offence, the\n          agreement itself becomes the offence of\n          criminal conspiracy. Where, however, the\n          agreement is to do an illegal act which is\n          not an offence or an act which is not\n          illegal by illegal means, some act besides\n          the agreement is necessary. Therefore, the\n          distinction     between   the    offence    of\n          abetment by conspiracy and the offence of\n          criminal   conspiracy,    so    far   as   the\n          agreement    to    commit   an   offence    is\n          concerned, lies in this.

There are several\n\nother aspects relating to offences including <a href=\"/doc/112749/\" id=\"a_243\">Section\n\n114</a> of the IPC which provides cumulative punishment for\n\nthe act abetted and also for the act done.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_99\">54. At the heart of the offence of abetment, however,\n\nis the presence of any of the three requirements in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1667403/\" id=\"a_244\">Section      107</a>   of   the    IPC.    The       key    and   indispensable\n\nelements      under     the    law    to        constitute       abetment      is\n\ninstigation, conspiracy or the intentional aiding by\n\nany act or illegal omission, the doing of the thing.\n\nThe    law    does      not    permit       the        abettor    to    escape\n\npunishment for abetment even if the actual player who\n\ncommits the offence is not criminally liable for the\n\nactual      act    which   results         in    the    commission       of    an\n\noffence (See in this regard, the situation contemplated\n\nin illustrations in Explanation III of <a href=\"/doc/1494082/\" id=\"a_245\">Section 108</a> of\n\nthe IPC). Equally, there need not be meeting of minds\n\nbetween all the persons involved in a conspiracy and it\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                      65</span>\n\fis sufficient if a person is engaged in the conspiracy\n\nfollowing     which        the     offence       is    committed     (See\n\nExplanation V to <a href=\"/doc/1494082/\" id=\"a_246\">Section 108</a> of the IPC). This means\n\nthat it is not even necessary that the persons who are\n\nengaged in the conspiracy, to even know the identity,\n\nleave alone physically meet the other players. There\n\ncan be any number of persons depending on their guilty\n\nmind    and   acts    or    omissions     which       may   render   them\n\nliable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">55. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"836678\" id=\"span_82\">In    <a href=\"/doc/836678/\" id=\"a_247\">Noor   Mohammad        Mohd.

The learned Judge proceeds to find that PWs 10 and\n\n11   are    accomplice    witnesses.    The   two   tests   to   test\n\naccomplice     evidence are     referred to,        viz., that    the\n\nevidence must be credible and, secondly, there must be\n\ncorroboration of accomplice evidence. The learned Judge\n\nnoted that PWs 10 and 11 have not been granted pardon\n\nby any court but further notes that the mere fact that\n\npardon was not tendered, did not make the accomplice\n\ncease to be an accomplice. It was further found that it\n\nwas a well-settled position of law that the evidence of\n\ntwo accomplices cannot be used to corroborate with each\n\nother as laid in R.V. Baskerville13. Support in this\n\nregard was sought from precedent in India in the form\n\nof judgment of this Court in Mohd. Husain Umar Kochra\n\nEtc. v. K.S. Dalipsinghji and another Etc.14 wherein\n\nthis Court, inter alia, laid down that corroboration\n\nmust   be    from    an   independent   source.     One   accomplice\n\ncannot corroborate another. This position was noted to\n\nbe reiterated in a still later decision of this Court\n\n13 1916 (2) KB 658\n\n14 (1969) 3 SCC 429\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                 68</span>\n\fin Chonampara Chellapan Etc. v. State of Kerala Etc.15.\n\nCorroboration must be in regard to material particulars\n\nor rather it must be in relation to the crime as well\n\nas identity of the accused. Noting that the accused\n\nbefore the Court were A3, A4 and A15, it was found\n\ncrucial that they were acquitted of the charge under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_255\">Section 120B</a> of the IPC. They were found convicted for\n\nthe offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_256\">Section 302</a> of the IPC read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_257\">Section 109</a> of the IPC and <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_258\">Section 365</a> of the IPC read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_259\">Section 109</a> of the IPC. Nothing on record was\n\nfound to show the direct involvement of the accused in\n\nthe abducting of the deceased or his murder. The Ford\n\nEscort Car-MO12 recovered at the instance of PW10 did\n\nnot trace back its ownership to A4. Thereafter, it is\n\nstated   that    the   requirement    of    corroboration     from\n\nindependent sources in material particulars, has not\n\nbeen met in the instant case and made it impossible for\n\nthe accused to be convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_260\">Sections 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_261\">364</a>\n\nof the IPC. PWs 10 and 11 were not witnesses to the\n\nabduction   of   the   deceased.     PW3,   who   witnessed   the\n15 (1979) 4 SCC 312\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                              69</span>\n\fabduction, it is stated, did not witness the accused at\n\nthe site of the abduction. Though, PW10 placed A3 and\n\nA4 in the meeting on 05.12.2001, significance of the\n\nsame was lost in view of their acquittal under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_262\">Section\n\n120B</a> of the IPC. PWs 10 and 11 have not placed any of\n\nthe three accused (A3, A4 and A15) at the site when the\n\nbody of the deceased was brought down in the factory.\n\nA3, according to the deposition of the accomplices, was\n\nfound staying downstairs while PW11, who went upstairs,\n\nactually saw the deceased tied to chains in the room\n\nwhere he was kept. PW11 only saw A5 at the site on the\n\nnight of 30.12.2001 carrying a tiffin parcel. The death\n\ncertificate of the deceased issued by PW32, which PW33\n\nhas stated was got at the instance of A3, was found,\n\neven if genuine, did not connect A3 in any way to the\n\ndeceased. As far as A15 is concerned, MO1-Reebok Shoe,\n\nwhich was recovered, was brushed aside by noticing that\n\nthe courts had failed to consider that PW31-a worker in\n\nthe factory, has stated that she could not remember the\n\nperson who came to get it as there is lapse of more\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                          70</span>\n\fthan two years. Therefore, PW31 cannot be used against\n\nA15.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"667073\" id=\"span_88\">PWs   1   and     2   in     their   testimony      (the    son   and\n\ndriver, respectively, of the deceased) stated that the\n\nReebok Shoes did not belong to the deceased. Evidence\n\nof PWs 10 and 11 was not found reliable. Finding the\n\naccused not guilty under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_263\">Section 120B</a> of the IPC, the\n\nlearned Judge noted that it was the duty of the Trial\n\nCourt    to   establish        the    involvement      of   each    of     the\n\naccused persons individually for each offence for which\n\nthey have been charged. Reference was made to <a href=\"/doc/1667403/\" id=\"a_264\">Section\n\n107</a> of the IPC, and thereafter, to the Judgment of this\n\nCourt    in   <a href=\"/doc/667073/\" id=\"a_265\">Kehar       Singh      and     others    v.   State       (Delhi\n\nAdministration</a>)16         that       something     more     than    a     mere\n\nconspiracy,       viz.,       some    act    or   illegal    omission       in\n\npursuance     of    the        conspiracy,        is   required      to     be\n\nestablished for abetment by conspiracy. Once a charge\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_266\">Section 120B</a> of the IPC fails, what was needed to\n\nconvict the appellants was the happening of some overt\n\nact on the part of the appellants. The learned Judge\n\nnoted that there was no evidence except the testimony\n16 (1988) 3 SCC 609\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                       71</span>\n\fof PWs 10 and 11 which linked the appellants to the\n\ncrime.

The learned Judge proceeded to discuss the evidence\n\nof PWs 10 and 11 elaborately. Thereafter, the prior\n\nrelationship between the accused came to be discussed.\n\nThe    circumstance      relating        to   selection    of   premises\n\nwhere the deceased was kept and other arrangements as\n\nalso   “abduction of       the deceased”         was discussed.      The\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                    73</span>\n\flearned Judge referred to the deposition of PW1-son of\n\nthe deceased. He also referred to evidence of PW3 and,\n\nat paragraph 20, it stated that PW3 has clearly stated\n\nthat   the    former      MLA   was      abducted     at    05.30    A.M..\n\n[Actually PW3 has stated that a person was put inside a\n\nvan by three persons]. Thereafter, motorcycle followed\n\nthe said van. That his friend Selvam also came there.\n\nPW13 has also stated that he has seen the deceased\n\ntaking morning walk at about 05.45 A.M.. The learned\n\nJudge finds that it is apparent that the deceased in\n\nthis   case    was       abducted     from     M.R.C.      Nagar.    After\n\nabduction,     the     evidence       discloses       meeting   at     the\n\nresidence of A9. He further finds that on 30.12.2001,\n\nPWs 10 and 11 have stated about A3 stating that the\n\nabduction     of   the    deceased       has   been   made    and    money\n\nremains to be collected. Thereafter, the learned Judge\n\ndiscusses evidence relating to taking of the deceased\n\nto the factory premises. In this regard, apart from PWs\n\n10 and 11, the learned Judge refers to the evidence of\n\nPW56 also. In regard to the commission of offence under\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                    74</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_272\">Section 302</a> of the IPC, it is found that abduction is\n\nproved       and     the    deceased          was    murdered        soon       after\n\nabduction in two days and the body cremated under the\n\nname of a fictitious person. The learned Judge finds\n\nthat    in    the    aforesaid         circumstances,         it     is    for   the\n\naccused person to satisfy the Court how the abducted\n\nvictim was dealt with by them. Undoubtedly, he noted\n\nthat there is no direct evidence with respect to the\n\nmurder       by    putting       nylon    rope       around    the        neck    and\n\ntightening          it     but    it     can        be    inferred,        in     the\n\ncircumstances,           that     they    committed          the     offence       of\n\nmurder also. There is evidence which clearly indicated\n\nthat the dead body of the deceased was taken from the\n\nfactory. Thereafter, the Court discusses again evidence\n\nof PWs 10, 11, 21 and 35 in regard to the removal of\n\nthe    dead       body   from    the     factory         premises.    Next,      the\n\nlearned Judge discusses the evidence relating to the\n\ncremation of the dead body. The evidence referred to\n\ninclude PWs19 and 36 apart from noting that PW12 has\n\nresiled from part of his statement. Next, the learned\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                         75</span>\n\fJudge elaborately discusses the evidence relating to\n\nthe   procuring   of   the   death      certificate        by   A3.   The\n\nconfessions    and recoveries         by the    accused were          next\n\ndiscussed. The effect of acquittal under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_273\">Section 120B</a>\n\nof the IPC next engaged the learned Judge. It was found\n\nthat mere acquittal under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_274\">Section 120B</a> of the IPC when\n\nthe   charge   under   <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_275\">Section    109</a>    of    the   IPC    was   found\n\nestablished, was of no avail to them.

The    commission         of\n\noffence   under    <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_283\">Section    109</a>      of     the    IPC    was   found\n17 (2004) 12 SCC 521\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                 76</span>\n\festablished along with other offences.

But of course the\n        circumstances may be such as to make it\n        safe to dispense with the necessity of\n        corroboration   and   in    those    special\n        circumstances a conviction so based would\n        not be illegal.

He    receives          pardon        in   exchange    for    the\n\nundertaking that he will give an unvarnished version of\n\nthe events in which he is a participant in the crime.\n\nHe would expose himself to proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1417508/\" id=\"a_310\">Section\n\n308</a> of the CrPC. Section 308 contemplates that if such\n\nperson has not complied with the condition on which the\n\ntender     of     pardon          was        given     either     by    wilfully\n\nconcealing       anything         essential           or   by    giving      false\n\nevidence, he can be put on trial for the offence in\n\nrespect to which the pardon was so tendered or for any\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                             88</span>\n\fother offence of which he appears to be a guilty in\n\nconnection with the same matters. This is besides the\n\nliability to be proceeded against for the offence of\n\nperjury. Sub-section (2) of Section 308 declares that\n\nany statement which is given by the person accepting\n\nthe tender of pardon and recorded under <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_311\">Section 164</a> and\n\nSection 306 can be used against him as evidence in the\n\ntrial under <a href=\"/doc/64931/\" id=\"a_312\">Section 308(1)</a> of the CrPC. An accomplice\n\nor an approver are competent witnesses. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1791136\" id=\"span_114\">An approver is\n\nan   accomplice,    who   has   received     pardon   within   the\n\nmeaning of Section 306.

It is\n\nalso   settled     principle    that   the   competency   of    an\n\naccomplice is not impaired, though, he could have been\n\ntried jointly with the accused and instead of so being\n\ntried, he has been made a witness for the prosecution.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                89</span>\n\fSee the judgment of this Court reported in <a href=\"/doc/1791136/\" id=\"a_314\">Chandran and\n\nOthers v.

It     is    clear    that    kidnapping      differs       from\n\nabduction. Kidnapping is of two kinds. Kidnapping from\n\nIndia involves taking a person against his consent or\n\nconsent    of   legally   authorised     person   out   of   India\n\n(Section    360).   Kidnapping        from   lawful   custody    is\n\noccasioned if a male below 16 years or female below 18\n\nyears or person of unsound mind is taken out of custody\n\nof lawful guardian without his consent (Section 361).\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">                                 98</span>\n\fAbduction, as defined in <a href=\"/doc/390542/\" id=\"a_347\">Section 362</a> of the IPC, occurs\n\nwhen by force or deceitful means, a person is induced\n\nto go from any place.

PW1 is the son of the deceased. He has deposed,\n\ninter alia, as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_155\">             His    father      is     an     MLA    of       Saidapet\n\n        Constituency. He is Director of Mahilapur Hindu\n\n        Saswatha    Nidhi    Limited    for    a    period     of    ten\n\n        years. He used to go walking in the morning as\n\n        he   was   suffering    from    diabetes.        He   used    to\n\n        leave the house at 05.30 A.M. in the morning\n\n        for walking in MRC Nagar near Ayyapan Temple\n\n        and return home at about 07.30 A.M.. He also\n\n        used to go for walking in the morning along\n\n        with one Ramesh residing near their house. On\n\n        30.12.2001,    his     father   went       for   walking      at\n\n        about 05.30 A.M.. Normally, his father used to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                               100</span>\n\fwear t-shirt, black track pant and black shoes.\n\nThe shoes were of one Reebok company. He did\n\nnot   return    home    on    30.12.2001.   He   went   in\n\nsearch of his father. He contacted his friends.\n\nThen, he went and lodged a complaint marked as\n\nExhibit PSEI. In cross-examination, PW1 deposed\n\nthat he did not state that his father used to\n\nwalk by using the Reebok shoes. The shirt and\n\nthe pant were not shown to him by the Crime\n\nBranch who investigated him. The Police asked\n\nhim to remove certain averments made by him in\n\nhis complaint. The complaint, after removal of\n\nthe averments, is PSE1. He went, at 08.00 P.M.,\n\nto the Anna Nagar Police Station. They have\n\ntold him that the father was in Tirumangalam\n\nPolice Station. Then, he went to Tirumangalam\n\nPolice. He was told that he was not there. He\n\nspeaks about learning that his father was kept\n\nin the Police Station and, sensing danger, he\n\nfiled   a      Habeas    Corpus    Petition.     In     the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                        101</span>\n\fcomplaint, he has averred that when his father\n\nwent for walking, he was illegally detained by\n\nthe   Police   for    procuring    certain      statements\n\nfrom him. He has read the Nakeeran Journal of\n\n05.03.2002. He says that he has stated that the\n\narrest of the A3 and A5 was mere eyewash. On\n\n30.12.2001, when his father went for walking\n\nonly his mother had seen him. The shoes worn by\n\nhis   father   was    bought    from   the     Mount     Road\n\nVasant   Complex     Reebok    Company.      Then   he   says\n\nthat the size of shoes was told by him to the\n\nPolice (CBCID) and then, they showed the shoes\n\nto him. PW1 told that the shoes did not belong\n\nto his father. Thereupon, permission was sought\n\nand granted to declare PW10 as hostile and he\n\nwas cross-examined. On 30.12.2001, his father\n\nhad gone for walking and had not returned till\n\ntoday. He has not contacted them through letter\n\nor phone. He has not challenged the dismissal\n\nof    Habeas   Corpus    petition.     The    age   of    his\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">                        102</span>\n\ffather is disclosed as 52 years on 30.12.2001.\n\nHis    father      did    not     fight    with     any   private\n\nperson       and     only        fought      with        political\n\nadversaries.        To    the      question,        whether      the\n\nPolice     had      given       him   any        audio    cassette\n\ncontaining the voice of his father and played\n\nit before his mother and brother, he answers in\n\nthe affirmative. He says there was no dispute\n\nbetween his father and A3 and other accused. In\n\nanswer to the question, whether the persons of\n\nADMK   had    any    grudge       against    his     father      for\n\nchanging his party to DMK, he said, yes, there\n\nwere serious disputes regarding this. He still\n\nbelieved      that       his     father     was      alive.      The\n\nprosecution conducted re-examination of PW1. He\n\nstates   that      when     the    CBCID    examined       him    on\n\n06.04.2002, he has not stated that the voice in\n\nthe    audio       cassette        was      of     his    father.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">Suggestion that he was purposefully deposing in\n\nfavour of the accused, was denied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_157\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">                          103</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">\f1.      PW2-Ramesh deposes that he is a car driver by\n\nprofession. He knew the deceased. He used to go to the\n\nhouse at 08.45 A.M. or 09.00 A.M.. He speaks about\n\ntaking the deceased to the company of which he was the\n\nDirector. He speaks about coming at about 09.00 A.M. on\n\n30th and the wife of the deceased informed him that her\n\nhusband has not returned home after he had gone for\n\nwalking. He says, to his knowledge, he did not know\n\nabout the fact that deceased went for walking on that\n\nday. After 29.12.2001, he has not seen the deceased.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_159\">2.    PW3    is   another   key     witness    produced    by     the\n\nprosecution to prove the aspect of abduction. He is a\n\nnative of Sri Lanka. He came to Chennai in 1991. In\n\n2001,   he    used   to   practice      wrestling.   He   would    do\n\nskipping and running along with others at MRC Nagar.\n\nHis   wrestling master      is Selvaraj.      On 30.12.2001,       at\n\nabout 05.30 A.M., as usual, he started to run. At that\n\ntime, at a distance of about 75 meters, he saw three\n\npersons forcing a person to get into a van. Thereafter,\n\nall of them went in the same van. It was an Omni Van. A\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">                                  104</span>\n\fmotorcycle followed that van. Thereafter, his friend\n\nSelvam     came    there.    He     told   this    to    him.      He    told\n\nSelvaraj Master. Selvaraj Master told him “why should\n\nwe bother about others.” He has stood by his statement\n\nin the cross-examination. He, no doubt, inter alia says\n\nthat in December, the sunrise will be late and that\n\n05.30 A.M. will be dark. He saw the incident at a\n\ndistance of 75 meters as there was street light. No\n\ndoubt, he says that during Police investigation, he did\n\nnot mention about the glow of street light. He did not\n\nlodge any complaint in the Police Station about the\n\nincident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_160\">3.   The    next        witness,    who    is     produced      to      prove\n\nabduction, is PW13. He states as follows:\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_161\">                  His     brother    is    working      in   the        Police\n\n           Department. From 1999, he has diabetes. He goes\n\n           for walk at MRC Nagar every day at morning\n\n           05.30 A.M.. On 30.12.2001, at 05.45 A.M. in the\n\n           morning, when he was walking in the MRC Nagar,\n\n           Kasturi Estate, the deceased came opposite to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                                    105</span>\n\f           him. He was wearing bright shoes, sandal colour\n\n           t-shirt and dark pant. He crossed him. He is\n\n           shown      MO14-photograph        and   he   identified       the\n\n           deceased. In cross-examination, he says that he\n\n           saw in the newspaper that the deceased was not\n\n           found but he did not see the TV.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_162\">                  It is, no doubt, true that Justice Arun\n\n           Mishra has found that it becomes apparent that\n\n           PW13 clearly stated that the former MLA Balan-\n\n           the     deceased      was    taking     morning     walk.     The\n\n           learned     Judge      concluded      that   it    is   apparent\n\n           that M.K. Balan had been abducted. PW3 has not\n\n           stated      that      it    was   the   deceased        who   was\n\n           abducted. He has not stated that three persons,\n\n           who pushed the deceased into the van were from\n\n           amongst the accused in the case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">4.     However, reading the evidence of PWs 1, 2, 3 and\n\n13, the following is established. The deceased used to\n\ngo for morning walk. He was indeed sighted by PW13 who\n\nalso    used     to   go   for    morning     walk.     PW3   has    indeed\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                                      106</span>\n\fwitnessed a person being pushed into Maruti Omni Van by\n\nthree persons and the Van going away followed by the\n\nmotorcycle.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_164\">5.    These facts are established. The evidence of PW10\n\nand PW11 is to be seen next in this regard. PW10 has,\n\ninter alia, stated that first and second accused were\n\nthere at the house of A9 on 30.12.2001. Both of them\n\ntold A3 that they have brought the MLA [M.K. Balan\n\n(deceased)] and only money had to be collected from\n\nhim. PW11 has stated that on 30.12.2001, he saw three\n\ncars at the factory led by a Tata Sumo (recovered at\n\nthe instance of A9), a Ford Escort Car (recovered at\n\nthe   instance     of   A4)    and    finally   came   the    Zen   Car\n\n(recovered    at    the       instance     of   A3).   Four   persons\n\nidentified as A4, A11, A16 and A17 brought the deceased\n\nout of the Ford Car. This takes place within hours of\n\nabduction on the same day. PW11 also speaks of three\n\npersons coming out of the Zen Car. PW10 also says that\n\non 31.12.2001, he found that the deceased was tied-up\n\nwith chain and his eyes were covered with a cloth and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                                     107</span>\n\fhe had been made to sit on a green steel cot provided\n\nby them already. He was wearing black pant and sandal\n\ncolour t-shirt. He has deposed that it was A5, A6, A7,\n\nA8, A10, A11 and A14, who were present. Still further,\n\nhe says that A3 threatened him that he would kill him\n\nand his family members if he discloses anything about\n\nthe matter. He further stated that “we had kidnapped\n\nex-MLA Balan itself, you are nothing to me”. Unless\n\nPW10   and    PW11,      PW3   and    PW13       are    disbelieved,     the\n\nconclusion is inevitable that the deceased was indeed\n\nabducted. The trial court finds that no one else was\n\nkidnapped on the same day. The Trial Court finds that\n\nA3, A4 to A8, A10, A11 and A14 to A17 kidnapped the\n\ndeceased (A10 stands acquitted by the High Court).\n\n\nTHE CIRCUMSTANCES RELATING TO OBTAINING OF FALSE DEATH\nCERTIFICATE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_165\">6.     PW32-a Medical Practitioner has proved Exhibit-\n\nP27-Death     Certificate.       He        has     deposed    that     PW33-\n\nKamaraj,     who   was    working     in     the       Government    General\n\nHospital, Chennai and acquainted with him for fifteen\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">                                     108</span>\n\fyears, came to him. He deposed that PW33 told that one\n\nperson known to him, viz., Rajamani Chettiar was 61\n\nyears and poor, died on 01.01.2002 at 06.00 P.M. due to\n\ncardiac arrest. There was no body to cremate him and he\n\nalone had to do all the work for him. He wanted death\n\ncertificate. Then, PW32 told PW33 that he would go to\n\nsee him (apparently, the deceased). PW33 told him, he\n\nvery well knows PW32 for the past fifteen years, would\n\nhe    lie   to   him   and   that    no   one    else    was       with   him\n\n(deceased) and PW33 has to do everything and he did not\n\nhave time. Believing what he stated to be true, PW32\n\nsays    that     he    issued   P27-death        certificate        without\n\nseeing the dead body. No doubt, PW32 has deposed in\n\ncross-examination        that   PW33      came    to    his    house      and\n\nstated that his younger paternal uncle working as a\n\nwatchman in the company had passed away. He has given\n\nthe    certificate      on   02.01.2002.         Though,      it    is    not\n\nwritten that it was issued on 02.01.2002, and in P27,\n\nit was shown that it was issued on 01.01.2002.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\">7.

He\n\ncorroborates statement of PW32 that they were\n\nknown    to   each    other         for    fifteen      years.   On\n\n01.01.2002, he was lying sick in his house. One\n\nSamikannu-A13 came and told him that he was\n\ncalled by A3. He was taken by Samikannu to the\n\nhouse of A3. A3 told him that one watchman died\n\nin Kollathur. PW33 was asked whether a vehicle\n\ncould be arranged. He tried in vain. He was\n\ngiven    Rs.50/-     by     A3      on    noting   that    he    had\n\nreached the next day by auto. A3 told him that\n\none Rajamani Chettiar expired and asked him to\n\nget a certificate. PW33 told about PW32 being\n\nknown to him for the last fifteen years. He\n\nwent to his place by auto. PW32 was there and\n\nhe     told   him    that       a    watchman      in   Kollathur\n\nCompany had died. PW32 believed PW33 and gave\n\nit in writing in a letterhead. He gave it to\n\nA3.

He says that he is giving\n\n        the deposition like this because he will lose\n\n        his   job   if   he   does   not    do    so.   He    did   not\n\n        identify A13 to the Police or the Magistrate in\n\n        the TI Parade. He also says, inter alia, that\n\n        it is false to say that accused-Samipannu did\n\n        not call him or take him to A3. He also says it\n\n        is not correct to state that he is giving false\n\n        deposition in the fear of losing his job. We\n\n        see no reason to take a different view.

It is to\n\nbe noted that going by the evidence of PW32 and PW33,\n\nA3 wanted such a certificate. The evidence of PW19 does\n\nsupport the prosecution case though he may not have\n\nidentified the ‘8’ persons who came. The Trial Court,\n\nnoted      that      he    had   identified      them     in   the        Test\n\nIdentification Parade.

We think it is appropriate that we should consider\n\nthe evidence of PWs 10 and 11.

Proceeding on the basis that\n\nPWs 10 and 11 are accomplices (though the Counsel for\n\nthe State has a case that PWs 10 and 11 cannot be\n\nconsidered   as    accomplices   insofar    as   it   related   to\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_357\">Section 302</a> of the IPC), we notice the\n\nfollowing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_179\">11.

Let us examine what he has stated. He was doing\n\nrice business in Tambaram from 1984 to 1995. From 1995,\n\nhe ran a business under the name and style of Valluvar\n\nTravels from 1985 with Uday Kumar (the ninth accused),\n\nhis friend. In 1998, he started a wine shop in which\n\nPW11 was also a partner. It was in 1999, the ninth\n\naccused informed that Krishna Pandi-PW34 was running a\n\nvermicelli company in Mudichur. He was facing a loss.\n\nPWs 10 and 11 invested in the venture of Krishna Pandi.\n\nThere is reference to the relationship between PW10 and\n\nthe ninth accused turning sour. PW10 purchased a Ford\n\nEscort car though in the name of one Ranjit Singh with\n\nwhom   he   had   business   connections.   The   registration\n\nnumber of the car was TN-10F-5555. He speaks about his\n\nreconciliation    with Uday    Kumar. In    2001, Uday   Kumar\n\napproached him and told him that he was to join ADMK\n\nwith the help of the A3 for which he had to do certain\n\nworks. For the same, he needed some houses. A search\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">                              118</span>\n\fwas mounted for an appropriate house. The third accused\n\ncomes upon the scene. PWs 10 and 11, along with Uday\n\nKumar-A9       and    A3,    finally,      finalise      the    vermicelli\n\nfactory    at    Mudichur        Road.     He   identified       the   third\n\naccused. Instructions were given by the third accused\n\nfor a screen to be put up on the windows of the factory\n\nbuilding. As ninth accused asked for two cots, PW10\n\nasked for two cots from one Guru, his friend. Chairs\n\nfrom the house of PW10, fan from the house of ninth\n\naccused and bedpan were kept in the factory by PW10, A9\n\nand PW11. Screen for the windows was put. Third accused\n\ntold   PW34     to    give   a   weeks’     leave      for   the   company.\n\nBelieving      that    he    would   get    rent,      PW10,    upon   being\n\nasked for his Ford Escort car, sent the car to the\n\nhouse of the ninth accused. There is reference to what\n\nhappened on 05.12.2001. On the said day, he was called\n\nby the ninth accused to come over to the residence of\n\nthe    third    accused.      There      were    two    or     three   other\n\npersons. PWs 10 and 11 followed the ninth accused who\n\nwent inside the house. Third accused was telling the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">                                     119</span>\n\fpersons and the ninth accused that the deceased had to\n\nbe brought and some money to be collected from him.\n\nPW10 identifies A4, A6 and A11 as persons who were\n\npresent at the residence of A3 and who followed them in\n\nanother car. There is reference to the involvement of\n\nA1, A2 and A12. PW10 has identified A5 as the person\n\nwho came along with A3, A9 and A1 by his Ford Escort\n\ncar. A1 was shown and he was talked about as a VIP, a\n\nvery big VIP. PWs 10 and 11 were to get food for him\n\nand    to   do    other     works.      PW10    has     spoken   about\n\nRs.1,10,000/- being given, as requested by Uday Kumar-\n\nA9, as money needed by A3. Money was handed over to A2.\n\n\nWHAT TRANSPIRED ON 30.12.2001 AS PER VERSION OF PW10 -\nTHE SALIENT ELEMENTS\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_181\">13.    On the said date, at 08.30 a.m., A9 called him\n\nover   phone     to   his   house.     PW10    called   PW11.    A   boy\n\nworking in his office, dropped him in residence in his\n\nmotorcycle and went back. A5 was asked to drop him at\n\nthe factory by a bike which was at the residence of A9.\n\nOn reaching factory, he received a phone call from A9\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">                                 120</span>\n\fasking him whether he had got the key. He further asked\n\nto handover the cell-phone to PW34-Krishna Pandi. After\n\nthe conversation, PW34-Krishna Pandi agreed to handover\n\nthe key. He handed over the key to A3 who came by auto.\n\nThe key came to be handed over to A5. A3 thereafter sat\n\nas a pillion rider with PW10 and went to the house of\n\nA9. PW10 followed A3 to the upstairs portion. Therein,\n\nA1    and   A2   were   there.   They   told   A3   that   they   had\n\nbrought the Ex. MLA (deceased) and only the money had\n\nto be collected from him. There is reference to Hotel\n\nHenkala where room was booked for A1. On the same day,\n\nat 05.00 p.m., the Ford Escort car was left in his\n\noffice by the driver of A3.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_182\">\n31.12.2001 – THE IMPORTANT FEATURES\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_183\">14.     Udai Kumar-A9 calls PW10 at 08.30 a.m. He was\n\nasked to come to Hotel Henkala. He went there. After\n\nsome time, A3 came. A3 told A9 that he needed a Maruti\n\nvan.   Apparently, A9      went outside        and brought   sandal\n\ncolour Maruti van. A3 took PW10, A9 and A1 in that\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">                                 121</span>\n\fMaruti van and went to the factory. A9 alone got down\n\nand was standing there. One person came from upstairs\n\nand took him (PW10) and A1 upstairs. There were about\n\nfive or six persons. The deceased was tied up with the\n\nchair and his eyes were also closed with cloth. He had\n\nbeen made to sit on the green steel cot which was\n\nprovided by them already. He was wearing black pant and\n\nsandal colour t-shirt. Navy blue shoes were lying in\n\nthe room somewhere far away from the steel cot. A1\n\nasked    A9    to   go   to   his   house   to   get    the   recorded\n\ncassettes (two in number) and two empty cassettes from\n\nA2. This is besides the tape recorder. A3 approached\n\nPW10 and A9 to get the things. PW10 speaks about the A9\n\ngetting Philips two-in-one tape recorder from his house\n\nand two recorded cassettes from A2. Also, two empty\n\ncassettes were purchased from a shop. One person came\n\nfrom upstairs and A3 told him to remove the cloth tied\n\naround   the    eyes     of   the   deceased.    PW10   speaks   about\n\nfeeling frightened. A3 came to him and told him that he\n\nsuspected only PW10 and his suspicion was that he would\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                                    122</span>\n\ftell to somebody. A3, it is deposed, threatened PW10\n\nthat    if    he     disclosed    anything        about   the   matter,    he\n\nwould    actually       kill     him   and    his   family      members.   A3\n\nfurther stated that “we have kidnapped Ex. MLA Balan\n\nitself, you are nothing to me”. He speaks about being\n\nvery much frightened. Around 07.30 p.m., on 30.12.2001,\n\nA9 called over phone and asked him to stay in the\n\nhotel.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">\n\n01.01.2002\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_185\">15. He went at 10.30 a.m. to the hotel after coming\n\nback from the hotel in the morning from the hotel to\n\nhis house. After some time, A3 came there. A3 asked A9\n\nfor an ambulance. PW10 and A9 went in search for an\n\nambulance. Not finding one, and on being told so, A3\n\ntold A9 to arrange for one Maruti van and to fix an\n\nAlumax       light     as   fixed      in    an   ambulance.      There    is\n\nreference to driver Vigi of A3 pointing out that shops\n\nwere closed as it was a holiday (being the New Year\n\nDay). By 08.00 p.m., a Maruti van was taken away by two\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">                                       123</span>\n\fpersons from the ninth accused. PW10 identifies these\n\npersons   as     sixth   accused    and     accused-Sampath      (A11).\n\nPW10    speaks    with    PW11     about     the    ambulance     being\n\nrequired and arranging up of a vehicle like ambulance.\n\nPW10 deposed that both of them suspected that something\n\nwas going on in the company. They started at 08.45 p.m.\n\nand    reached    Mudichur    by    09.00    a.m..       The   gate   was\n\nclosed. A6 was standing near the gate. He saw them and\n\nmade them go from there. A golden colour Maruti van was\n\nstanding there. Because they were scared, they came by\n\nwalk.   A5   went   in    a   motorbike      to    the    company.    The\n\nmotorbike went inside and it was standing in the light.\n\nFour persons came from upstairs carrying the body of\n\nthe deceased, two holding his legs and two his hands.\n\nPW10 refers to the deceased wearing black colour pant\n\nand sandal colour t-shirt. Body was kept on a slab like\n\nplace. There was no movement in the body. The body was\n\nloaded in the van and it started very fast. A5 went on\n\nthe motor bike. This, in short, is the account by PW10\n\nabout what he saw and what he knows about the incident.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">                                   124</span>\n\fPW10 identifies A5, A6, A7, A8, A10, A11 and A14 as the\n\npersons whom he saw near the deceased when he was tied-\n\nup   on   the     first       floor    of   the    factory        (this    is\n\napparently on 31.12.2001).

PW10 has this to say in his cross examination:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">          On 30.12.2001 he did not go to the Vermicilli\n\n     factory [this is a point which is also pressed by\n\n     counsel for the appellant for the reason that in\n\n     his chief examination he had said that he had gone\n\n     to   the    factory      on   30.12.2001].         However,     it    is\n\n     pertinent to note that in cross examination itself\n\n     PW10 has stated that on 30th at about 8.30 am he\n\n     went to get the key, from there he went back at\n\n     9.30 am.      He did not go thereafter [which makes it\n\n     clear      that   that    PW10    indeed     did   go   on    30th]   as\n\n     deposed by him in his cross examination.                       He, no\n\n     doubt, says that till he was there a person called\n\n     M.K. Balan was not brought there.                  He further says\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_157\">                                      125</span>\n\fin his cross examination that he had given a cheque\n\nfor the room rent for the hotel from which he has\n\nvacated on 02.01.2002.              He states that he did not\n\ntell    anyone      outside    about    the     matter,   he     had\n\nmentioned the police for the first time what he has\n\nseen on 01.05.2002.           It was due to fear he did not\n\nsay.    He further says that after seeing the Police,\n\nhis    fear   had    gone.      He    further   states    that    he\n\ndenies having met Nakkeran Gopal and discussed with\n\nhim.    He no doubt says that if it is asked whether\n\nhe is accurately aware of the incident that had\n\nhappened in the factory from 31.12.2001, he did not\n\nknow.      About 15-20 days before 5.12.2001 he had\n\nseen A3.      He saw A4 for the first time on 5.12.2001\n\nat the house of the 3rd accused.                  He says after\n\nhearing A3 telling the persons available there that\n\nthe Ex. MLA M.K. Balan had to be brought and some\n\nmoney had to be collected from him, it did not\n\nstrike that it could be a violent act.               He further\n\nsays in cross that all the accused were not to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_158\">                              126</span>\n\fknown him earlier.          He denies having identified A10\n\nand A14 after they were identified by the Police to\n\nhim.     He says that he had finally shown his house\n\nalso.    His house was also shown to them as he could\n\nget commission.        There is toilet facility in the\n\nVermicilli       factory.        (In   the   re-examination      he\n\nstates    that    toilet    is   in    the   ground   floor.    The\n\nsignificance of this aspect is that a bedpack was\n\nalso used when the deceased was kept in the first\n\nfloor)     He     further    states     that   he   did   not   ask\n\nKrishan Pandi (PW34) how long it is to let out and\n\nwhat is the monthly rent and what is the advance\n\namount and what is the commission for the same, he\n\nalso did not tell him.              He does not know how many\n\nworkers were working in the factory, he could not\n\napproximately also.          He does not have the details\n\nabout men and women who are working in the factory.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_187\">He was standing at a distance of 50ft. away from\n\nthe place of occurrence (apparently on 01.01.2002).\n\nHe next says that if it is asked that why it was\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                              127</span>\n\f       not informed to PW34 about the incident witnessed\n\n       by him when this incident took place, he was not a\n\n       partner in the factory but then he says that he\n\n       received the interest amount for the amount given\n\n       to PW34.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_188\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_189\">17. It is time to look what PW11, the other accomplice\n\nhas deposed.       This is for the reason also that there is\n\nan argument that PW10 and PW 11, the two accomplices do\n\nnot even corroborate each other.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_190\">18. He identifies A9 as the person with whom PW10 was\n\ndoing sand quarry business.              He states about PW9 and PW\n\n10 conversing with each other at the Polling Booth, A9\n\ntelling PW10 that he is going to join the ADMK and\n\nabout A3, he is going to arrange for a position for\n\nhim.     He speaks about the need for some houses, the\n\nhunt for houses and various houses being shown and the\n\ninvolvement       of   A3   in   this    matter.   He   speaks   about\n\ninvestment which A9 persuaded him and PW10 to make in\n\nthe factory run by PW34.            A3 told A9 that the factory\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">                                   128</span>\n\fis the correct place.         He is able to identify A3 and\n\nidentifies him.      The Ford Escort car was obtained from\n\nPW10   on   rental   basis    by    A9    and   given   to   A3.     On\n\n05.12.2001, A9 informed him and PW10 that A3 has asked\n\nthem to go to his house.           Three persons were present at\n\nthe residence of A3.         He identifies them as A4, A6 and\n\nA7.    He    further   states      that    A3   told    A9   that   the\n\ndeceased had to give money and the same had to be\n\ncollected by bringing him.               He speaks about A3 going\n\nbefore them in the Ford Escort Car.                He speaks about\n\nA12. He identifies A5 as the person who assisted A1\n\nSenthil Kr.     On 30.12.2001, at round 8.30 A.M., PW10\n\ncalled him and asked him to go to the house of A9.                   He\n\nwent there and saw that PW10 was not there. A9 took him\n\nin Tata Sumo and they were waiting at Mudichur Road\n\nJunction.    After half an hour, the Ford Escort car came\n\nand A3 came out of the car and was talking to A9.                    A9\n\ntold him to take A3 by an auto and go to the factory.\n\nPW 10 and A5 was there at the factory.                 A3 saw him and\n\nasked A5 whether the company is ready?                  Then he took\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">                                   129</span>\n\fthe company key from PW10 and gave the same to A5.\n\nAfter about half an hour, A9 called him over phone and\n\ntold him to open the gate of the company.                 The Tata\n\nSumo came first, followed by Ford Escort and Maruti\n\nZen.   Four persons got down from Ford car.              Those four\n\npersons brought the deceased by closing his eyes, mouth\n\nand tying his hands and took him to the first floor.\n\nThe deceased was wearing black colour pant, sandalwood\n\ncolour t-Shirt and shoes.          Three persons came out of\n\nthe Zen.   A9 came to him and asked him whether he knew\n\nthat he is N.K. Balan (deceased) and he also threatened\n\nhim that if he discloses the same to anybody A3 will\n\nkill him and his family members.             He identified the\n\nfour   persons   who   brought     the   deceased   in    the   Ford\n\nEscort car as A4, A11, A16 and A17.            He speaks about\n\nfurther details, like three more persons coming with\n\nthe tiffin parcels and that he could identify them,\n\nviz., A6, A15 and A7.      He went to his house.          The same\n\nday after PW10 called him over phone and asked him to\n\ngo Hotel Henkala. In Room No.207, he saw A9, PW10 and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">                                 130</span>\n\fA1.    He stayed with A1 during that night.                       The next\n\nday, viz., on 31.12.2001 at 6.00 A.M., he went from the\n\nHotel where he stayed in the night on 30.12.2001.                        He\n\nspeaks     about   buying    lunch       for    10    persons      in    the\n\nfactory.     By 12 noon he was asked to buy lunch for 10\n\npersons, BP tablet and headache tablet and hand them\n\nover to A5 in the factory.           He bought them the same and\n\nwent home (on 1.1.2001), he was called at 10.00 am by\n\nA9 and to get tiffin and he got the lunch for them in\n\nthe afternoon.       A5 told him that there is no need for\n\ngetting dinner in the night and they are going to start\n\nfrom there and asked him to convey the same to A9.\n\nAfter 8.00 pm in the night PW 10 called him over phone\n\nand asked him to come to Hotel Henkala…                 He went there\n\nand PW10 told that they need not to get lunch and PW10\n\ntold him that A3 and A9 asked to arrange for a van and\n\nfor   that   he    had   replied    that       he   cannot   do    and   A9\n\narranged one van.           PW10 told him that something is\n\ngoing and he is not aware of the same.                  Then PW10 told\n\nhim that let us go and see in the factory.                        Both of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">                                   131</span>\n\fthem   went   to     the    company       by    the     motorcycle.         Two\n\npersons were near the gate.                    Both of them told them\n\nthat they have no work there and they can go from\n\nthere.     Then PW12 left the bike adjacent to the company\n\nand when PW10 crossed the company gate they saw A5\n\ngoing into the factory.           At that time four persons came\n\nfrom upstairs of the factory carrying N.K. Balan who\n\nwas    wearing      the     black     colour          pant    and        T-shirt\n\nsandalwood colour and they left him on the floor. They\n\ntied up the deceased with a dhoti brought by A5 and\n\ncarried him to the van and the van started from there.\n\nA5 went by motorbike.             The van registration number is\n\nTN 22-B-8853 (MO7).          The Ford Escort number stated by\n\nhim is TN 10-F 5555 (MO6).            Maruti van number is TN 02-\n\nZ-99     (MO12)     and    Tata   Sumo         number    is       TN-04-B-9657\n\n(MO13). PW11 speaks about him and PW10 being scared and\n\nthey went back home.          PW10 told him that he was called\n\nby A3 and told him that if this matter is leaked out\n\nanywhere, he will kill him and his family.                           This, in\n\nsubstance     is,    what    PW11     has       spoken       in    his     chief\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">                                    132</span>\n\fexamination.

He has seen the deceased\n\n   but he did not have any contact with him.              PW10 had\n\n   left (MO6)-CAR in the travels for rent. The house\n\n   being selected and arrangements in the factory at\n\n   Mudichur Road were known to him, A9, A3, PW34 and\n\n   Venugopal PW 10 and the arrangement at the factory\n\n   was known to PW10 and PW11 alone.               He speaks about\n\n   the cot being purchased from Nirmala industries on\n\n   Shanmugham Road.       He, A9 and PW10 has purchased the\n\n   same.      Three cots were purchased.            The cot is of\n\n   green colour and he could identify it.

He knew the accused already.

Police did not\n\ncall him to identify any of the accused.                   He also\n\ndid not go.        He did not identify (MOI).

A9 is a member in the Puratchi Bharatem\n\nParty at state level.           He is not a member of ADMK.\n\nA9 has own car.

During the police investigation the\n\nidentification, colour, height etc. of the deceased\n\nwas not asked from him and he had also not stated\n\nabout the same.          When a person stands outside the\n\ngate of the factory, the incident taking place there\n\ncould be seen.      During the night there was no light\n\noutside the factory.

The next circumstance appearing against the third\n\naccused which corroborates the testimony of PW10 and\n\nPW11, is the circumstance relating to the creation of a\n\nfalse death certificate of the deceased. In our view,\n\nthe prosecution has, indeed, succeeded in proving the\n\nfollowing:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">        At     the     instance         of     A3,   PW32    (medical\n\n     practitioner) who was known to PW33 was persuaded\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">                                  144</span>\n\fto issue a false certificate.

PW36-Office Assistant In-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_199\">Charge of the Burial Ground has deposed that on\n\n02.01.2002, PW19 told him after he (PW36) left,\n\n(apparently on the previous day) a body came and\n\nthe Doctor’s Certificate would be given on that\n\nday. The Certificate is P27. The certificate was,\n\napparently, produced in view of what was requested\n\nby PW19, a licence in the cremation ground, PW12\n\nhas become hostile but even PW12 has deposed about\n\na person being cremated, on 01.01.2002, in the\n\nnight and his role along with PW19 in it. The\n\ncertificate was procured at the instance of A3. It\n\nwas meant to facilitate the cremation of the dead\n\nbody   on   the   date   of     the   death.    Going   by    the\n\ntestimony    of   PW1,   the     deceased      was   around    52\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">                          145</span>\n\fyears.

It may be that the age is shown as above\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_200\">60. The circumstance of A3 creating the document\n\nfor which purpose A13 was an emissary (A13 has not\n\nfiled any appeal), goes a long way to strengthen\n\nthe prosecution case. We see no reason at all not\n\nto    conclude    that       the       body    which       was    cremated\n\nthrough PW19 and PW12 on 01.01.2002 was that of\n\nthe deceased. Not only would the cremation and\n\nthat too under a false name attract the offence\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_358\">Section 201</a> of IPC, which deals with the\n\ndestruction of evidence of committing of offence\n\nbut   it   is    an     important           chain   in     the    list    of\n\ncircumstances which unerringly points to the role\n\nof A3 and others in the crime of murder also. The\n\ncircumstance is a vital corroborative link which\n\nestablishes       the       case       of    not    only      murder      but\n\nrelates back to the abduction. This is for the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">                                 146</span>\n\f     reason that it will be absurd to believe that the\n\n     deceased      went    with    the       accused     voluntarily     and\n\n     willingly, particularly, when the evidence of PW13\n\n     and PW3 are also borne in mind. We stand reminded\n\n     that abduction takes place either when there is\n\n     force or deceit in causing a person to move from a\n\n     place       under   <a href=\"/doc/390542/\" id=\"a_359\">Section       362</a>    of   the    IPC.   PW10    has\n\n     spoken of seeing the deceased tied and blindfolded\n\n     in the upstairs portion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_201\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_202\">23. This is a case where the accused have not only\n\ncarried out a grave crime of murder but they have also\n\nattempted    to     efface       the     most      important     evidence\n\nrelating    to    the    same,    viz.,      the   corpus    delicti.     We\n\nreject also the contention that the non-production of\n\nthe body is fatal to the prosecution case. The evidence\n\nof PW32, PW33 and PW36 (the Officer of the Corporation\n\nbefore   whom     the    certificate         was   produced)     and    PW38\n\nassumes critical significance. The hand of A3 from the\n\nbeginning, i.e., from the selection of the factory,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_179\">                                   147</span>\n\farranging of vehicles, confinement and cremation, is\n\ncrystal   clear    and     his     role     in   the     murder     is\n\nestablished. It is in this context that evidence of\n\nPW10 and PW11 falls to be appreciated. The evidence of\n\nPW34 clearly confirms clinchingly the role of A3 and\n\nsufficiently    corroborates      PW10     and   PW11.      We   would\n\narrive at the conclusion even excluding MO28 and MO33\n\nas agreed to by the Counsel for the State.\n\n\nACCUSED NO. 4 (A4)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_203\">24. A4    was   arrested     on        09.04.2002.     He    made    a\n\nconfessional statement-P34 witnessed by PW39. It led to\n\nthe recovery of Ford Escort White Car TN1075554. PW10\n\ndeposed that he bought the same car though in the name\n\nof one Ranjit Singh. He further deposes that by the end\n\nof November, 2001, A9 called him over phone and asked\n\nhim for the said Ford car. A9 asked for two or three\n\nmonths. PW10 believing that he will pay the rent, sent\n\nthe car to the house of A9. The driver of A3-Viji came\n\nand took that car. The use of the said car is mentioned\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">                                 148</span>\n\fby PW10 thereafter by deposing that on 05.12.2001, A3\n\nwent out in the said car which had been given by him\n\nfor rent. He also identified A4 as one among the three\n\npersons who followed them on that day. Thereafter, the\n\nsaid car makes its appearance when he speaks about A3\n\ntelling A9 to be at the Woodlands Hotel and going along\n\nwith A1 and A2 in the car. He again speaks about A3\n\ncoming alone to the Woodlands Hotel by the same car.\n\nAgain around 07.00 P.M., A3, A9 and A1 came along with\n\none more person by the same car. That other person is\n\nnone other than A5. Thereafter, he says, on 30.12.2001,\n\nat 05.00 P.M., the driver of A3 had left the car in his\n\noffice. In his cross-examination, PW10 has deposed that\n\nhe bought the car for Rs.3,60,000/- from one Advocate\n\nDurai Pandi. He, no doubt, admits that it is not in his\n\nname.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_204\">25. Passing on to PW11 in connection with the vehicle,\n\nPW11 has noted the Ford Escort car on 30.12.2001 as the\n\ncar from which four persons got down and those persons\n\nbrought the deceased by closing his eyes and mouth and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">                          149</span>\n\fhands being tied and took him to the first floor. He\n\nhas marked the Ford Escort Car as MO6. It is this car\n\nwhich stands recovered on the basis of the statement\n\ngiven   by   A4.    This    is     a    case    based      essentially   on\n\ncircumstantial evidence. The statement made by A4 led\n\nto the discovery of the car in the circumstances which\n\nhave already been explained in the evidence of PW10 and\n\nthe presence of A4, not only on 05.12.2001 but also on\n\n30.12.2001,    has       crucial       relevance      in   particular    the\n\npresence on 30.12.2001. A4 was present along with three\n\nothers and they emerged out of the very same car, viz.,\n\nthe Ford Escort car, in which, apparently, the deceased\n\nwas brought. The condition of the deceased, viz., his\n\neyes and mouth being closed and hands being tied and\n\nbeing taken to the first floor, are matters of moment\n\nin   connecting     A4    with     the       gory    episode   having    its\n\norigin in the abduction of the deceased, his illegal\n\nconfinement        and     culminating          in     his     murder    and\n\ncremation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_205\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_182\">                                       150</span>\n\fACCUSED NO. 5 (A5)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_206\">26. PW10 refers to him, in his deposition, as coming\n\nalong with A3, A9 and A1 around 07.00 P.M. by the Ford\n\nEscort Car. He has been identified by PW10. This is on\n\n05.12.2001. A3 introduced him to A5 and though they\n\n(PW10 and PW11), provided food to Senthil Kumar-A1, it\n\nwas to be served only by A5. His involvement is further\n\nspoken about by PW10 as having occurred on 30.12.2001.\n\nOn   the   said   day,   PW10   speaks     about    going   to    the\n\nresidence of A9 on being called by him. A9 asked for\n\nthe keys of the factory. A9 asked A5 to drop him in the\n\nfactory on a bike. PW10 and A5 went to the factory.\n\nThere is further reference to the key being handed over\n\nby PW34 to PW10. The key was handed over by PW10 to A3\n\nwho came in the auto. PW10 deposed about the key being\n\ngiven to A5. On the fateful day, on 01.01.2002, when\n\nthe murder took place, PW10 has named A5 as going in a\n\nmotorcycle   to   the    company.     It   went    inside   and   was\n\nstanding in the light. A cloth bag was there in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_183\">                                151</span>\n\fbike.    The       body    of    the    deceased      was   brought   from\n\nupstairs      by    four    persons.     PW10     then   deposes    that   a\n\ncloth was taken from the bag brought by A5 and tied\n\naround the body of the deceased like doing for a dead\n\nbody. A5 is cited by PW10 as going in his motorcycle.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_207\">27. PW11 has also spoken about A3 telling them about\n\nthe person. He identified him. He also says that A3\n\ntold that A1 is a VIP and only A5 will do everything\n\nfor     him    and        that   they        should   not   do     anything\n\n(apparently directly). He notices presence of A5 along\n\nwith PW10 on 30.12.2001 at the factory. A3 asked A5\n\nwhether the company is ready. A3 and A5 told that they\n\nwere going to the house of A9 and went from there. He\n\nspeaks about A5 going by the Zen car on 30.12.2001.\n\nThereafter, about half-an-hour later, the Tata Sumo car\n\ncame. In the same, A5 and three more persons came with\n\nthe tiffin parcel. These persons have been identified\n\nas A6, A15 and A7. On 31.12.2001, by 12 Noon, on being\n\nasked by A9, he purchases lunch and medicine and handed\n\nover to A5. On 01.01.2002, A5 told PW11 that there was\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">                                       152</span>\n\fno need for getting dinner in the night. PW11 has also\n\nseen A5 going into the company. He also speaks about\n\ndhoti brought by A5 used to tie-up the deceased and A5\n\nleaving    on    a   motorcycle.    A5,    who   was   arrested      on\n\n18.03.2002[the first arrestee in this case], has, in\n\nfact, given statement under which he has identified the\n\nMaruti Omni Van MO9 bearing No. TN-A-7484, the place\n\n(factory) as also the cremation ground. The Maruti Omni\n\nVan-MO9 is the Van which was used for abduction of the\n\ndeceased. PW3 has spoken about a person being pushed\n\ninto   a   Maruti    Van.   The    facts   discovered        based   on\n\nstatement by A5 are very significant, and hence, most\n\nrelevant, not only in revealing his involvement but\n\nunravelling the entire prosecution case. A statement\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_360\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act is not only about\n\nthe thing as such which is discovered consequent upon\n\nthe statement but the knowledge attributable to the\n\nperson     who   makes   the   statement     about     the    matter,\n\ndiscovered, based on the statement.

Lastly, PW34 has spoken\n\nabout the presence of A5 on 30.12.01 and identified\n\nhim.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_208\">\n\nA6, A7, A8 and A11\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_209\">28. What is the evidence, as regards, these accused/\n\nappellants     before      us?    Taking       the    evidence         of     the\n\naccomplices, PW10 has this to say about them – He says\n\nthat   along    with      A4,    A6     and    A11    were      present        on\n\n05.12.2001 as two out of the three persons present in\n\nthe residence of A3. He speaks about A3 telling the\n\npersons and A9 that Balan had to be brought and some\n\nmoney to be collected from him. He also speaks about\n\nthe three persons as A4, A6 and A11, following him,\n\nPW11, A9 in another car. He further speaks about their\n\ninvolvement     when      he    deposed      that    on    01.01.2002,         A9\n\nasked PW10 to wait at the hotel and he came with a\n\ngolden colour Maruti van. By 8 P.M. that Maruti van was\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_186\">                                      154</span>\n\ftaken by two persons from A9. Those two persons have\n\nbeen identified as A6 and A11. Presence of A6 and his\n\ninvolvement is further deposed by PW10 when he states\n\nthat the 6th accused was standing near the gate of the\n\nfactory later on 01.01.2002. PW10 and PW11 were asked\n\nto go away. He speaks about PW10 and PW11 being scared\n\nafter the threat by A6. He further identifies A6, A7\n\nand A11 as among the persons who were present near the\n\ndeceased when he was tied up in the first floor of the\n\nfactory. He also identified A6, A7, A8 and A11 as the\n\npersons who carried the dead body of the deceased. They\n\ngo in the van with the body. At this juncture, it is\n\napposite to notice PW18 deposing that he is the owner\n\nof van bearing No. TN 22-8853. He has deposed to giving\n\nthe van to A9 on earlier occasions. More importantly,\n\nhe has deposed to it being taken by A9 on 01.01.2002 at\n\nabout 10 A.M. and it being returned only on 2.01.2002\n\nand its seizure by the police on 30.03.2002.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_210\">29.

PW11, for whatever it is worth in law, has\n\nalso identified A6 and A11 as two out of the three\n\npersons who were in conversation at the residence of A3\n\non 05.12.2001. He has also spoken about A3 telling A9\n\nthat the deceased had to give some money and it has to\n\nbe collected by bringing him. He also speaks about A6\n\nand A11, inter alia, following them in another car. He\n\nhas identified A11 as one among the four persons who\n\nbrought M.K. Balan in the Ford car on 30.12.2001. He\n\nalso identified A6 and A7 as among the persons as two\n\nout of the three persons who came with A5 in the Tata\n\nSumo car which came again on 30.12.2001.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_211\">30. Now let us look at the other evidence available,\n\npointing to the involvement of the aforesaid accused.\n\nPW21 is a Head constable (Police). He has deposed to be\n\non   night   duty   on   01.01.2002.   He   speaks   about   being\n\ngiven beat tickets along with PW35. He speaks about a\n\nMaruti Omni van standing in the middle of the road. He\n\nand PW35 went to the van. He asked the occupants what\n\nthey were doing at that hour. They told that they were\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_188\">                               156</span>\n\fcelebrating the new year with drinks. Though, on become\n\nsuspicious, they searched the van from inside but there\n\nwas nothing suspicious inside it. They continued with\n\ntheir duty.     He has proved P10 beat ticket. He has also\n\nidentified     the   accused    as   A6,   A7    and   A11.   He   also\n\nspoken about the identification done by him before the\n\nMagistrate by way of TIP. He has proved P11 - the duty\n\nbook.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_212\">31. PW35 is the constable referred to by PW21. He also\n\nspeaks about being on duty on 01.01.2002. He speaks\n\nabout going with PW21 to Melpatti, Ponnappa Street from\n\n24:00 hours (PW19 speaks about the cremation from being\n\nat Melpatti, Ponnapa Mudali Street). He speaks about\n\nfinding of Maruti vehicle bearing no. TN-22-B8853 in\n\nMelpatti New Street. He speaks about interacting with\n\nthe     four   persons.   The    vehicle        was    standing    near\n\nPerambur cemetery and the sodium lamp was burning. He\n\nhas proved P28 as his duty book. PW10 is also his beat\n\nbook. He has also identified A6, A7, A8 and A11 as the\n\npersons who were present. He has also identified the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                                 157</span>\n\fvan   which     he    saw    as     MO7.       He   has   spoken    about     the\n\nidentification done in the TIP.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_213\">32. It is relevant to remember that PW10 has identified\n\nA6, A7, A8 and A11 as the persons who carried the dead\n\nbody of the deceased on 01.01.2002. It is also to be\n\nborne in mind that PW10 and PW11 have spoken about\n\ntheir body being loaded in a golden colour Maruti van\n\nwhich   has     also       been    identified        by   PW10     as   MO7   and\n\nbearing the very same registration no. TN 22-B-8853. It\n\nis    corroborated          by     the     evidence       of   PW35     (Police\n\nConstable). The evidence clinchingly points to A6, A7,\n\nA8 and A11 being involved apparently at the behest of\n\nA3    and    carrying       dead    body       of   the   deceased      on    the\n\nfateful day in the van and their presence near the\n\nplace       where    the    deceased       came      to   be     cremated.     To\n\noverlook the testimony of PW10 and PW11 in a case based\n\non circumstantial evidence, being about matters which\n\ncould not possibly, have been witnessed by any other\n\nwitnesses other than the accomplices will be asking for\n\nthe impossible except perhaps concocted evidence.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_190\">                                         158</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_214\">\f33. A6 was arrested on 19.03.2002.

TN-0343\n\nwhich was parked in front of the house of PW37 and\n\nseized under P17. The Maruti van itself has been marked\n\nas MO8 but we would exclude the same from consideration\n\nfor reasons which we have discussed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_215\">34.    A7    was   arrested    on     20.03.2002.   He   gave    the\n\nadmissible    portion   of    confession     statement   which    is\n\nP38. PW42 is a Village Administrative officer who has\n\nwitnessed the statement. On the basis of the statement,\n\nthe green colour steel cot was seized. It is marked as\n\nMO11. It was produced and seized under P38 which is\n\nalso witnessed by PW42. PW34 and PW31 have also spoken\n\nabout the cot apart from PW10. The evidence of PW10\n\nshows that when he went upstairs, he found that the\n\ndeceased whose eyes were closed was tied with a chain\n\nand he was asked to sit in a green colour steel cot. He\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">                                159</span>\n\fhas been identified by PW21 and PW35 police officers as\n\none of the four, present near the spot of cremation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_216\">35. A8 was arrested on 22.03.2002. He gave a confession\n\nstatement in the presence of PW23 and another witness,\n\nP14 is the admissible portion. PW35 police constable\n\nhas identified him as one of the four found in MO7 van\n\non 01.012002 near the cremation ground.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_217\">36. We have noticed that PW11 has identified A11 as one\n\nof the persons who brought the deceased in the Ford car\n\nto the factory. It is to be remembered that PW11 has\n\nidentified     the   accused   in      the    Identification     Parade\n\nconducted by the Judicial Magistrate. That apart, after\n\narrest,   he   gave   P53-Statement.          He   has   produced    the\n\nPhilips Stereo Cassette Recorder which was recovered\n\nunder P54-Mahazar marked as MO2. To lend assurance to\n\nthis   circumstance,      PW46,        working     in     the   Revenue\n\nDepartment, has been examined. The tape-recorder was\n\nhidden in the house of A11.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_218\">37. Moreover, PW21 and PW35, Police Constables, have\n\ndeposed   to     seeing    A11         near     the      graveyard    on\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_192\">                                 160</span>\n\f01/02.01.2002. They were standing near MO7. MO7 is the\n\nVan in which the deceased was taken from the factory\n\nafter the murder. It is the Golden Colour Maruti Van\n\nbearing    No.   TN228853.      PW11    has,   in     his    deposition,\n\ngiven the same number in his evidence as the number of\n\nthe Van in which the body of the deceased was taken\n\naway from the factory. Therefore, presence of A11, as\n\nnoted by PW11, from 30.12.2001 till after the murder\n\nand   near   the    site   of    the     cremation,     as     noted   by\n\nindependent      witnesses-PW21        and   PW35,    lend    sufficient\n\nassurance to the prosecution case against him. PW10 has\n\nalso deposed to identifying A11 as one of the three\n\npersons who were present at the residence of A3 on\n\n05.12.2001. It is on that day A3 said that the deceased\n\nhad to be brought and some money had to be collected\n\nfrom him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_219\">38. It must be remembered that the evidence in this\n\ncase establishes that the deceased was indeed cremated\n\nunder the name of a fictitious person mentioned in the\n\ndeath     certificate      issued       by     PW32     (the     medical\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_193\">                                  161</span>\n\fpractitioner). It is also clear that such certificate\n\nis procured by A3 through PW33. It is clear that A6,\n\nA7, A8 and A11 were clearly involved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_220\">\nA14\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_221\">39. With regard to A14, his involvement in the matter\n\nemerges as one of the persons who stood in the upstairs\n\nof the building with the deceased when the deceased was\n\nin the state of illegal confinement. This, no doubt, is\n\nbased on the testimony of PW10. No doubt, as far as A14\n\nis concerned, there is no recovery. It is true that\n\nthere is no direct evidence that the accused abducted\n\nor murdered the victim. The case, as already noticed,\n\nhinges on circumstantial evidence.         We do notice that\n\nA10 has been acquitted by the High Court. A10 himself\n\nwas also named by PW10 as present along with A14 at the\n\ntime of the illegal confinement. The High Court has, in\n\nparagraph 33, assigned cogent reasons for acquitting\n\nA10,   including,   inter   alia,   that   PW11   though   had\n\nidentified A10 in the Test Identification Parade, could\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">                             162</span>\n\fnot identify him in the Court.

A15 is the sole appellant in Criminal Appeal No.\n\n828 of 2013.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_223\">41.     PW3, the witness to prove the abduction has spoken\n\nabout a motor cycle following the Omni van. He earlier\n\ndeposes that he saw three persons were forcing a person\n\nto get into the van. A15 gave a statement to the police\n\nin the presence of PW44 and another (Mutthu Rekku). The\n\nadmissible    portion     of   the   statement   is    P50.    As    per\n\nPW44, he stated that he will provide the fashion Hero\n\nHonda    bearing    No.    TN-05-C-6475.     PW44     says    that    he\n\nidentified the motorcycle parked in front of a compound\n\nof a house at Gandhiji Street, Bharathi Nagar and also\n\nthe shoe. PW67 has spoken about recovery of the motor\n\ncycle under P51 Mahazer. The motor cycle is MO10 while\n\nthe   shoe   is    MO1.   Justice    Arun   Mishra    confirmed      his\n\nconviction even after eschewing MO1 shoes. [PW1 the son\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">                                 163</span>\n\fof the deceased deposed that the shoes showed by the\n\nCBCID did not belong to his father]. As regards the\n\nmotorcycle,      PW10      has       deposed     that     A9     wanted     an\n\nambassador      car     and     a    motor     cycle.     PW10       got   the\n\nmotorcycle     from     his      friend      Akbar   which      is    fashion\n\nvehicle and navy blue in colour and gave it to A9. PW10\n\nasked   for    return      of       the    motorcycle.     He    marks     the\n\nmotorcycle as MO10.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_224\">42.     As    noticed,     A15       has    stated    that      he   got   the\n\nmotorcycle from one Akbar. PW48 is the said Akbar. His\n\nname is shown as Shaheed Akbar. In his deposition, he\n\nhas stated that he was having a fashion motor bike Hero\n\nHonda    but    he      states        that     he    purchased        through\n\nfinancier. He further states that the Registration No.\n\nTN-04-J-1878 blue colour. He further states that PW10\n\nwas known to him well. He used to take his vehicle\n\noften. Last year, during November, 2001, the said Venu\n\n(PW10) apparently, had taken his vehicle and did not\n\nreturn it. The RC book related with the vehicle is with\n\nthe   financier.      He      has     produced      and   marked      as   P58\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">                                      164</span>\n\fphotocopy     of   the    RC    of   the   said     motor     vehicle.    He\n\ndeposes that motor bike seen by him which belongs to\n\nhim. He further says that the registration number of\n\nthe vehicle which he saw, was not in the said motor\n\nbike. It is that motor bike which is marked as MO10. No\n\ndoubt, in the cross, he says that he does not know the\n\nwheel base and weight of the bike, inter alia. He has\n\nneither issued any notice to PW10 nor had he filed any\n\ncomplaint. He says that he has neither repaid any loan\n\nnor received any notice from any financier. MO10 was\n\nmarked by PW10 and under the statement under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_362\">Section 27</a>\n\nthe    vehicle     which       is    seized       actually,      has     the\n\nregistration no. TN-8-6785 whereas the vehicle which\n\nPW48 from whom PW10 took the vehicle for giving it to\n\nA3    as   requested     by    A9,   bears    no.     TN-04-J-1878.      The\n\nevidence of PW48 makes it clear that it is the same\n\nvehicle      and   he     does,      no      doubt,     say     that     the\n\nregistration number of the vehicle was not in the said\n\nmotorcycle. This means that the vehicle marked as MO10\n\nis, indeed, the vehicle belonging to PW48. He makes it\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">                                     165</span>\n\fover to PW10. As requested by A9, PW10 handed it over\n\nto A9. It would appear that the registration number, as\n\nwas    originally    seen      on    the    motorcycle,          has   been\n\nchanged. It is the motorcycle which was apparently seen\n\nby PW3 and used at the time of abducting the deceased.\n\nThe vehicle has been recovered at the instance of A15.\n\nEven ignoring the shoe which is recovered on the basis\n\nof    the   statement,   we    would      think    that    the    evidence\n\nsufficiently implicates A15.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_225\">\nA16\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_226\">43.    PW11 has deposed that they were amongst the four\n\npersons who brought the deceased in the Ford car on the\n\n30.12.2001. Moreover, no doubt, in cross, he is unable\n\nto remember A16 which he persevered with the names of\n\nother three. But he does speak of his presence at the\n\nfactory. Regarding A16, he was taken into custody, and\n\non    questioning   in   the    presence      of    PW47    and    another\n\nwitness, he gave a confessional statement. He stated\n\nthat if he is taken, he would produce the black bag,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_198\">                                    166</span>\n\fcell phone and knife from the house at Villivakkam. P56\n\nis marked as the admissible portion. On being so taken\n\nto the place at No.110/57, Nehru Nagar, Villivakkam, he\n\nidentified      a    Panasonic       Cell    Phone,    sim     card    with\n\ncharger, one black colour carry bag, nine feet long\n\nyellow   colour       nylon    rope    and    two     chains.    This    is\n\nbesides knife and three locks. Therefore, it cannot be\n\nsaid that there was no corroboration for the role of\n\nA16. It is quite clear that A16 was amongst the accused\n\nwho brought the deceased. His role in the abduction\n\nbecomes clear. It is also clear that the deceased is\n\nnot only not alive but was undoubtedly done away by way\n\nof murder. Having abducted the deceased, it is clear\n\nthat the role of A16, as assessed by the Trial Court\n\nand   further       accepted    by    the    High     Court,    does    not\n\nrequire interference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_227\">\n\nAccused No.17 (A17)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_199\">                                     167</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_228\">\f44.

On a perusal of P65 which\n\nis    the    confessional        statement         given       by    her\n\nunder       <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_368\">Section    164</a>      of    The   <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_369\">Code    of        Criminal\n\nProcedure</a>,        1973    (hereinafter         referred         to    as\n\n‘the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_370\">CrPC</a>’, for short), the Court found that\n\nanyone would come to the conclusion that she\n\nwas living as per the Indian culture. She is a\n\nmother      of    twins    and       growing    them     well.       The\n\nsecond       accused      is    her     husband.        The     second\n\naccused, as per P65 statement, was suffering a\n\nloss and facing financial problems. The second\n\naccused fell into the cunning trap of first\n\naccused. The second accused forced the twelfth\n\naccused to fall into the cunning trap of the\n\nfirst accused. The first and twelfth accused\n\ngot    married      out    of    their      love    affair.          The\n\nmarriage took place at a temple as per Hindu\n\nRites       and    Customs.          Initially,         when     first\n\naccused      asked     twelfth        accused      to    talk       like\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">                          171</span>\n\fSasikala, she refused. Then the twelfth accused\n\ndid not talk over phone thereafter. The first\n\naccused      pushed    the       second   accused       into   his\n\ncunning trap and on account of that the twelfth\n\naccused was convinced by the second accused and\n\nshe has talked over cell phone to the third\n\naccused as if Sasikala talked to him. There was\n\na threat by the first accused to the twelfth\n\naccused. A2 forced his wife to act and to fall\n\ninto the cunning trap. The Trial Court further\n\ngoes    on   to   state      that    normally      in    foreign\n\ncountries, it would be commonly seen that while\n\nthe     husband       is     committing       mistakes         and\n\nmisdeeds, the wife would leave her husband and\n\nchoose anyone as her husband of her choice as\n\nthat of changing clothes every day. The Trial\n\nCourt further finds that it is not the State in\n\nour    country.   When       the    husband   is    doing      any\n\nwrong deeds, the wife would mend her husband in\n\nsome way or the other and when the wife is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">                           172</span>\n\ftrying to mend her husband and she is forced to\n\ndo the same by her husband, she would do it as\n\nwhat her husband is asking her to do so and she\n\nthinks that her husband is as God and thereby\n\nshe   is   committing     such    mistakes.    The   Trial\n\nCourt goes on to hold that the twelfth accused\n\nthat if she told anything about her husband, he\n\nwould be taken by the Police. As a result of\n\nthat she had been suffering and on account of\n\nthe fact that she followed the Tamil culture,\n\nshe did not whisper anything about her husband.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">It is clearly seen that the Court goes on to\n\nhold that A12 did not do anything to attract\n\nthe offence under <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_371\">Section 34</a> with the intention\n\nor motive and that she did not feel that she\n\nhad   done   anything     wrong    and   she   was   doing\n\nanything only as to what was stated by her\n\nhusband and then she has been arrayed as A12.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">The Court goes on to find that she cannot be\n\nheld guilty under the fourth charge which is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">                    173</span>\n\f          framed under Sections 419, 420 and 387 read\n\n          with <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_372\">Section 109</a> of the IPC. However, the Court\n\n          proceeds      to    find    accused      Nos.    1    and    2    had\n\n          committed offences under <a href=\"/doc/1667388/\" id=\"a_373\">Sections 419</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_374\">420</a>\n\n          of the IPC.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_234\">47. A12 was not labouring under any disability. We may\n\nhave   our     reservation        about     exonerating        A12    on    the\n\nreasoning that as it was perceived to be a part of the\n\nduty of the wife in the Indian culture to obey her\n\nhusband      even    when   the    demand     of   the    husband      is    to\n\ncommit a criminal act. We notice, however, that not\n\nonly   A12     was   acquitted      by     the   Trial    Court      but    the\n\nappeal    by   the    State   against       her    acquittal         has   been\n\ndismissed by the High Court.                 The State has also not\n\nchallenged her acquittal before this Court. No doubt\n\nA12 would be criminally liable for only those acts done\n\nwith the requisite mens rea. Hence, we say no more.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_235\">48. What is, however, important is that it is not a\n\ncase where the Court has not believed the version of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">                                     174</span>\n\fthe prosecution that the twelfth accused did make the\n\ncalls posing herself as Sasikala.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_236\">49. It is true that arguments have been addressed that\n\nthere is no evidence to show that A12 knew the voice of\n\nSasikala and contention is seen raised in <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_375\">Section 313</a>\n\nCrPC   Statement    of   A3   that   A3   knew   the   voice   of\n\nSasikala.   The    prosecution   would    have   to    prove   the\n\nnegative if it is called upon to prove that A3 did not\n\nknow the voice of Sasikala. Though it is the duty of\n\nthe prosecution to prove the case, it may not extend to\n\nholding that a matter which could be proved by the\n\ndefence as something within his knowledge, the accused\n\ncan sit tight. Further, the case of the prosecution\n\nmust, at any rate, be judged with reference to the\n\nactions of A3 and the other accused who are described\n\nas his henchmen. The wealth of evidence, extending even\n\nto A3, ‘procuring’ a totally false death certificate,\n\nis formidable. It should be noted that the first charge\n\nwas essentially framed that A1 to A3 had conspired. A1\n\nand A2 have accepted the verdict and we are not called\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">                               175</span>\n\fupon to judge the correctness of their conviction under\n\nSection 120B. It may be true that, though, there is a\n\ncharge against all the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_376\">Section 120B</a> of\n\nthe IPC, except A1 and A2, all the other accused stand\n\nacquitted under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_377\">Section 120B</a> of the IPC.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_237\">50. The question would, therefore, arise as to what is\n\nthe effect of acquittal of the appellants before us\n\nunder   Section 120B.   We are      primarily concerned   with\n\ntheir   conviction   under   Section   302   besides   Sections\n\n387, 365 read with <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_378\">Section 109</a> of the IPC and <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_379\">Sections\n\n364</a> and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_380\">201</a> of the IPC. The fact that the appellants\n\nhave been acquitted under Section 120B will not, in our\n\nview, extricate them from criminal liability for their\n\nacts which would constitute substantive offences under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_381\">Sections 302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/996413/\" id=\"a_382\">347</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1688284/\" id=\"a_383\">387</a> of the IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_238\">\n\nA DEEPER GLANCE AT THE CHARGES; THE EFFECT OF ACQUITTAL\nOF A12\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_239\">51. The first charge is to the effect that A1, A2 and\n\nA3 conspired in November, 2001 to kidnap the deceased\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">                              176</span>\n\fand to extract money. It was further agreed to murder\n\nhim in case he refuses to pay money. Based on the said\n\nconspiracy,       on   30.12.2001       early     morning,     he    was\n\nkidnaped,      detained   at   the      factory    and   murdered     on\n\n01.01.2002. Thereby a charge under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_384\">Section 120B</a> of the\n\nIPC was framed against A1 to A18. The second charge is\n\nabout    actual    kidnapping     (it     must    be   understood     as\n\nabducting). The abduction is alleged to be done by A4,\n\nA7, A10, A11, A14, A15, A16 and A17 in a Maruti Van\n\nbearing Registration No. TNA7484. A15 went in a Hero\n\nHonda Motorcycle to show the route. The deceased was\n\nkept at the factory belonging to PW34. The aforesaid\n\naccused were charged under <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_385\">Section 365</a> of the IPC. For\n\nabetment of the said offences, A1 to A3, A5, A6, A8, A9\n\nand A13 to A18 were charged under <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_386\">Section 365</a> of the\n\nIPC read with <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_387\">Section 109</a> of the IPC for going in a car\n\nbearing No. TN10F5555. All the accused, except A12 and\n\nA13,    were   charged    under   Section        387   for   tying   the\n\ndeceased with iron chain and rope in a cot and he was\n\nthreatened to part with Rs. 16 crores or else execute\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_209\">                                  177</span>\n\fthe documents in regard to his properties. The fourth\n\ncharge is to the effect that in order to fulfil such\n\nconspiracy,      and       in   pursuance    to    the    same,   at    the\n\ninstance and the instigation of A1 and A2, A12 spoke to\n\nA3 in the voice of Sashikala uttering the words, if\n\npossible, to get the amount or else close him and come\n\nalong    with         A1    and   meet      her-A12.      Charges      were\n\naccordingly framed against A12 under <a href=\"/doc/1667388/\" id=\"a_388\">Section 419</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_389\">420</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1688284/\" id=\"a_390\">387</a> of the IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_391\">Section 109</a> of the IPC.\n\nThe fifth charge was in order to fulfil the object of\n\nthe     said     conspiracy,        consequent          upon   the     said\n\noccurrence, on 01.01.2002, A3, A4, A6 to A8, A10, A11\n\nand A14 to A18 committed the murder of the deceased by\n\ntying    a     rope    around     the     neck    and    tightening     it.\n\nLikewise, A1, A2, A5, A9, A12 and A13 were charged\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_392\">Section 302</a> of the IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_393\">Section 109</a> of\n\nthe IPC for abetment of murder. There is a charge under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/996413/\" id=\"a_394\">Sections 347</a> and <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_395\">364</a> of the IPC for kidnapping against\n\nA3 to A11 and A13 to A18 and A1, A2 and A12 were\n\ncharged, with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_396\">Section 109</a> of the IPC, under\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_210\">                                    178</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/996413/\" id=\"a_397\">Sections 347</a> and <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_398\">364</a> of the IPC. Charge was also framed\n\nagainst A8, A10, A11 and A13 to A18 under <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_399\">Section 201</a>\n\nof the IPC for cremation of the body and getting the\n\nfalse certificate as if one Rajamani Chettiar had died\n\ndue to heart ailment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_240\">52. There is the argument addressed before us that the\n\neffect of the acquittal of the appellants under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_400\">Section\n\n120B</a> of the IPC would be that their conviction under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_401\">Section 302</a> of the IPC and other offences cannot be\n\nsustained. As we have noted, the charge under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_402\">Section\n\n120B</a> of the IPC is based on the conspiracy hatched\n\nbetween A1 to A3. No doubt, the charges laid against A1\n\nto A18 under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_403\">Section 120B</a> of the IPC, is essentially\n\nbased on the conspiracy between A1 to A3. It is to be\n\nnoted, however, the charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_404\">Section 302</a> of the IPC\n\nis against A3, A4, A6 to A8, A10, A11 and A14 to A18.\n\nIt was A1, A2, A5, A9, A12 and A13, who were charged\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_405\">Section 302</a> of the IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_406\">Section 109</a> of\n\nthe IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_241\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_211\">                          179</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_242\">\f53. We agree that for a charge under <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_407\">Section 109</a> of the\n\nIPC, a minimum of two persons are required. There can\n\nbe    any   number      of    accused       charged     with     the    aid       of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_408\">Section     109</a>    of    the     IPC.       In   order    that        there       is\n\nabetment,     it   is    indispensable           also    that    there       is    a\n\nperson who abets another. To take an example, a person\n\nshoots with his gun on being intentionally aided or\n\ninstigated in doing so by another. The latter would be\n\nguilty under <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_409\">Section 109</a> of the IPC along with the\n\nperson who actually carried out the murder by shooting.\n\nThus, there is a principal player and the abettor. The\n\nprincipal     player         would    be    guilty      for     the    acts       or\n\nomissions which amount to offences under the law. The\n\nabettor though does not trigger the gun, if we may use\n\nthe   expression,       “is     the   moving      force       behind    it    and\n\nbecomes liable as such”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_243\">54. In this case, the Trial Court has proceeded to find\n\nthe appellants (except A5) guilty of the fifth charge\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_410\">Section 302</a> IPC whereas the A1 and A2 have been\n\nfound guilty of the charge of conspiracy under <a href=\"/doc/1658410/\" id=\"a_411\">Section\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_212\">                                      180</span></a>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_412\">120B</a> of the IPC. In other words, the idea to commit the\n\noffences came into being in the minds of A1 and A2. The\n\nother players have been roped in on the basis of their\n\nacts which was in tune with the conspiracy hatched by\n\nA1 and A2. The acquittal of A12, who has been charged\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_413\">Section 120B</a> of the IPC and also for offences\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1667388/\" id=\"a_414\">Sections 419</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_415\">420</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1688284/\" id=\"a_416\">387</a> of the IPC read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_417\">Section     109</a>      of   the   IPC   would      not    detract    from     the\n\ncriminality of the acts committed by the other accused\n\nand, in the facts of this case, we would think that\n\nthere   is      no    illegality      involved         in    convicting     the\n\nappellants in the manner done under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_418\">Section 302</a> of the\n\nIPC. The Trial Court has found that the plan was the\n\nbrainchild essentially of A1 and A2\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_244\">55. .     We     have     noticed     that       the    trial     Court     has\n\nessentially proceeded on the basis that the appellants\n\nwere except A5, charged under Section 302 under the 5th\n\ncharge were guilty of the said charge (See paragraph-\n\n167   for      the   discussion).           We   have       referred   to   the\n\nparagraphs in the judgment of the trial court wherein\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_213\">                                      181</span>\n\fthe trial court has found A3, A4, A6, A7, A8, A9, A10,\n\nA11, A14, A15, A16 and A17 guilty under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_419\">section 302</a>\n\nIPC. It must be noticed that it is without invoking\n\n<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_420\">Section 109</a> of the IPC.   However, it so happened, that\n\nin the initial portion of the judgment of the trial\n\nCourt it is mentioned that <a href=\"/doc/1630403/\" id=\"a_421\">Section 109</a> was also invoked\n\nalong with Section 302 which is inconsistent with the\n\nactual charge which was adverted to and findings by the\n\ntrial Court. It is on this basis apparently that the\n\nHigh Court and this Court also proceeded in the matter.\n\nThis inconsistency must, in our view, be resolved by\n\nholding that the finding is to be understood as one in\n\nterms of the 5th charge as discussed from paragraph 167\n\nonwards of the judgment of the trial Court.   We would\n\nproceed to hold further that if it is so understood\n\nthen the criticism levelled that even A1 and A2 are\n\nconvicted with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/1630403/\" id=\"a_422\">Section 109</a> and there would\n\nbe no principal player would not hold good.    We must\n\nappreciate that the first charge is that a conspiracy\n\nwas woven between accused No.1, 2 and 3 within the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_214\">                          182</span>\n\fmeaning     of   Section    120B.     It    has    not      been    found\n\nacceptable to the trial Court and only A1 and A2 are\n\nfound   guilty     under   <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_423\">Section    120B</a>    of     the    IPC.      The\n\nacquittal of A12 as we have noticed, would not deflect\n\nfrom the factum of the conspiracy between A1 and A2. So\n\nalso, the acquittal of A3 in this regard. We have also\n\ntouched upon the provisions of explanation 5 to the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1494082/\" id=\"a_424\">Section 108</a> of the IPC.

This means that since accused 1 and 2 are held\n\nguilty under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_426\">Section 120B</a> of the IPC to commit the\n\nmurder of the deceased, they are to be punished as if\n\nthey have abetted the said offence.                    The judgment of\n\nthe trial Court is to be understood in the said vein.\n\nIt is true that abetment by conspiracy is only one form\n\nof abetment. There can be alternate charges. There can\n\nbe abetment by instigation and intentional acting even\n\nwhen there is no conspiracy and, therefore, no abetment\n\nby conspiracy. The fifth charge against A1, A2, A5, A9,\n\nA12   and   A13     would   be   in     the    form   of   an    alternate\n\ncharge. We say this as A5 (Appellant before us) in\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 2008 of 2017 is charged and found\n\nguilty of murder under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_427\">Section 302</a> of the IPC read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_428\">Section 109</a> of the IPC. The role of A5, particularly,\n\nhaving regard to the statement under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_429\">Section 27</a> of the\n\nEvidence     Act,    leading     to     recovery      of   the   Van,   the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_216\">                                      184</span>\n\fdiscovery of the site of the factory and the cremation\n\nground besides other evidence, cannot be ignored.                         We\n\nhave no hesitation in repelling the contention of the\n\nappellants    on    this   ground.        It   is   clear       that   their\n\nacquittal under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_430\">Section 120B</a> of the IPC will not impact\n\ntheir conviction under the other provisions.\n\n\n\nCERTAIN CONTENTIONS OF A6\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_248\">57. PW21     and   PW35    have    identified         A6   in    the    Test\n\nIdentification Parade.         The contention that there would\n\nbe possibility of these witnesses being seen before the\n\nParade does not appeal to us.              The presence of the Omni\n\nVan and A6 besides 3 others on the very date on which\n\nmurder was committed and near the site of cremation and\n\nthe   fact   of    cremation      of     the   body    being     done,   is\n\ncertainly a very important circumstance and not to be\n\nignored as contended.         The fact that PW19 has not found\n\nit possible to remember A6 though he has identified him\n\nin the Test Identification Parade before the Magistrate\n\ncannot   lead      to   the    obliteration           of   the    evidence\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_217\">                                   185</span>\n\frelating to the cremation on 01.01.2002 and about 8\n\npersons coming there.             The fact that PW 19 has stated\n\nthat the person identified in MO14 photograph was the\n\nperson cremated is not liable to be brushed aside.                           We\n\nshould also not be oblivious to the principle that in a\n\ncase   of     this        nature,    the     total         effect     of     the\n\ncircumstances, must be borne in mind. It must be safe\n\nto   believe       the    accomplice      evidence         based     on    other\n\nmaterials available.            We find the evidence of PW10 and\n\nPW11 credible and the presence and role attributable to\n\nA6 cannot be brushed aside.                The presence of A6 spoken\n\nto by the accomplices on 05.12.2001, 30.12.2001 and,\n\nparticularly,        on    01.01.2002       on       which    last    day     in\n\ncarrying     the    dead     body   in     the       van   which     is    later\n\nidentified by the police officer at a spot near the\n\ncremation     ground       is    certainly       a    vital    circumstance\n\nwhich cannot be brushed aside.                   The role of A6 in the\n\nillegal     confinement         appears    to    be    established.           No\n\ndoubt there is recovery of MO8 which is attacked on the\n\nscore that PW 24 “has identified A8 as A6”. We have\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">                                    186</span>\n\fdealt with it elsewhere and shall not be detained by\n\nit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_249\">\n\nABDUCTION, ILLEGAL CONFINEMENT, MURDER AND CREMATION IN\nFICTITIOUS NAME\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_250\">58.      It is clear that the deceased was abducted on\n\n30.12.2001.          It    is       also     established       that       he     was\n\nconfined      illegally        at    the     upstairs     portion         of     the\n\nfactory at Moudihur owned by PW34.                      It is clear from\n\nthe evidence that it was the body of the deceased which\n\nwas    cremated      and   a    fictitious       name    was       used    and    a\n\ncertificate     issued at           the instance        of A3(P27)             which\n\ncircumstance         is        clinching        in      establishing             the\n\nprosecution case.          As far as the murder is concerned,\n\nthere    is   no     direct      evidence.           There    is    no     direct\n\nevidence      that    deceased        is     murdered    by    strangulating\n\nhim.    However, it is equally true that on the basis of\n\nrecovery made at the instance of A16 a nylon rope and\n\nchain was recovered which undoubtedly strengthens the\n\nprosecution     case.          There cannot          be medical       evidence\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">                                       187</span>\n\frelating       to    murder       in    a    case       where       the       body    stood\n\ncremated.            We    have    no       hesitation             in       ignoring      the\n\nevidence relating to recovery of certain parts of the\n\nbody of the deceased but that is not sufficient for the\n\naccused to persuade us to throw out the prosecution\n\ncase.      A carefully thought out criminal plan has led to\n\nthe cruel snuffing out of precious life.                                     The players\n\nthought      it      through       meticulously               by    destroying            the\n\ncorpus delicti by cremation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_251\">59. The      abduction        followed            by    murder          in   appropriate\n\ncases can enable a court to presume that the abductor\n\nis   the     murderer.            Now   the       principle             is    that    after\n\nabduction,          the    abductor         would       be    in        a    position      to\n\nexplain what happened to his victim and if he failed to\n\ndo     so,   it      is     only       natural          and    logical             that    an\n\nirresistible inference may be drawn that he has done\n\naway    with      the      hapless      victim.              <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_431\">Section         106</a>     of   the\n\nEvidence       Act        would    come      to        the    assistance            of    the\n\nprosecution. In this regard it is necessary to look at\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_220\">                                            188</span>\n\fwhat this Court has laid down.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"575647\" id=\"span_221\">In <a href=\"/doc/575647/\" id=\"a_432\">State of W.B. v.

So the important task of the\n            prosecution   was   to  demonstrate    that\n            abduction of Mahesh was for murdering him.\n            Even if the murder did not take place, the\n            offence would be complete if the abduction\n            was completed with the said objective.\n            Conversely, if there was no such objective\n            when the abduction was perpetrated, but\n            later the abductors murdered the victim,\n            <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_434\">Section 364</a> IPC would not be attracted,\n            though in such a case the court may have\n            to   consider  whether   the   offence   of\n            culpable homicide (amounting to or not\n            amounting to murder) was committed.”\n\nIn this case the trial Court has convicted the\n\nappellants under <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_435\">Section 364</a> IPC.

Persons are\n        kidnapped in the sight of others and are\n        forcibly taken out of the sight of all\n        others and later the kidnapped are\n        killed. If a legal principle is to be\n        laid down that for the murder of such\n        kidnapped there should necessarily be\n        independent evidence apart from the\n        circumstances enumerated above, we would\n        be providing a safe jurisprudence for\n        protecting such criminal activities.\n        India cannot now afford to lay down any\n        such legal principle insulating the\n        marauders of their activities of killing\n        kidnapped innocents outside the ken of\n        others.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_254\">60.

Section 347 involves wrongful confinement of a\n\nperson for the purpose of committing extortion.              The\n\nappellants have been convicted under <a href=\"/doc/996413/\" id=\"a_442\">Sections 347</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1688284/\" id=\"a_443\">387</a> of the IPC.     This is not an inexorable rule but to\n\nbe applied based on the factual matrix presented before\n\nthe   court.    Where   abduction   is   followed   by   illegal\n\nconfinement and still later by death,          the inference\n\nbecomes overwhelming that the victim died at the hands\n\nof those who abducted/confined him.        Nobody has a case\n\nthat the deceased died a natural death.             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"575647\" id=\"span_227\">In <a href=\"/doc/575647/\" id=\"a_444\">State of\n\nW.B.</a> (supra) therein, the Court, inter alia, held as\n\nfollows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">                “34.

But the test is whether it is\n\nsafe to convict the accused believing such witnesses.\n\nWe are of the view that as regards the crime and the\n\naccused,    their    testimony      brings    home       the    truth,       as\n\nregards accused who are appellants before us.                       There is\n\nno    motive     attributed   to    PW10     and    PW11       to    falsely\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_230\">                                   194</span>\n\fimplicate.

The role of A15 is clear who was not only been\n\nreferred to in the accomplice evidence but corroborates\n\nhis     link     in    the        abduction     with    the     recovery      of\n\nmotorcycle at his instance.                    It has rightfully earned\n\nhim conviction under <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_446\">Section 365</a> IPC.                         There were two\n\ncars apart from the Ford Escort on 30.12.2001 at the\n\nsite of the illegal confinement.                     From the Maruti Zen,\n\nthree persons emerged as witnessed by PW11.                          It is true\n\nthat PW11 has not identified them. That apart there was\n\nalso a Tata Sumo, PW11 no doubt identified A5 and A7\n\napart     from    A15        as    the    persons      who    came     back   on\n\n30.12.2001 with tiffin after leaving the factory.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_260\">63.      The trial Court has convicted A4, A11, A15, A16\n\nand     A17    under        Section      365   which     in    our     view   is\n\nunassailable in regard to these accused who are also\n\nappellants before us.                We do not see any error in the\n\ncourt drawing the presumption that they are also guilty\n\nof murdering the deceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_261\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_231\">                                         195</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_262\">\f64.     PW3, it must be remembered has spoken of three\n\nmen pushing another into a van on 30.12.2001.             The van\n\nmoved and it was followed by a motorcycle.           It must be\n\nremembered that A15 gave a statement leading to the\n\nrecovery of a motorcycle.        The evidence is relied by\n\nthe two courts and we see no reason to take a different\n\nview.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_263\">65.     As far as A3, A5, A6 and A8 are concerned, they\n\nstand   convicted under     Section 365    read with      Section\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_264\">109.    Abetting is to be understood in the context of\n\ntheir   acting   on   the   conspiracy    which   stood    proved\n\nagainst A1 and A2.     No doubt, abetting also takes place\n\nwhen there is instigation or intentional aiding.              The\n\nrole of A3 looms large.       It is clear that he organised\n\nthe whole thing and it commenced with the search for an\n\nappropriate house where the victim could be confined\n\nafter the abduction.        His role along with his men in\n\ncarrying   out the    crime culminating     in the    cremation\n\nunder fictitious name of the abducted person is clear.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_232\">                              196</span>\n\fNot only there is evidence of PW10 and PW11 but other\n\nevidence which includes PW32, PW33, PW36 and PW8.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_265\">66. As far as A7 and A14 are concerned, they have also\n\nbeen convicted under Section 365 and also under Section\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_266\">364.      The involvement of A7 is clear. He makes his\n\nmaiden\n\nappearance in the accomplice evidence as early as on\n\n05.12.2001.      PW10 has witnessed him standing along with\n\ncertain other accused by the side of the deceased who\n\nwas then clearly in the state of illegal confinement.\n\nHe further establishes his complicity by bringing down\n\nthe body of the deceased on 01.01.2002 along with three\n\nothers.       His role is also corroborated by the testimony\n\nof PW21 and PW35, Police officers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_267\">67. A7    and    A14   we   would     think      ought     to    have    been\n\nconvicted under Section 365 read with <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_447\">Section 109</a> of\n\nthe    IPC.     We   notice   that        A3,   A5,   A6   and    A8    stood\n\nconvicted under Section 365 read with <a href=\"/doc/1630403/\" id=\"a_448\">Section 109</a>.                         We\n\nnotice however that the charge as against A7 and A14\n\nwas under Section 365.        We further notice the charge as\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">                                    197</span>\n\fagainst A14 is concerned is also under Section 365 read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_449\">Section 109</a> of the IPC. As already noticed all the\n\nappellants have been convicted also under <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_450\">Section 364</a>\n\nof IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_268\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1347962\" id=\"span_234\">68. In this connection as regards the lack of a charge\n\nor defect in a charge is concerned, it is one which is\n\nessentially intertwined with the question of prejudice\n\nto the accused.       See in this regard the judgment of\n\nthis   Court   in   <a href=\"/doc/1347962/\" id=\"a_451\">Willie   (William)   Slaney   v.   State   of\n\nMadhya Pradesh</a> AIR 1956 SC 116.          We do not think that\n\nprejudice is caused in this regard in the facts.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_269\">69.    It must be noticed that the evidence in this case\n\nno doubt through the mouth of PW10 and PW11 who alone\n\nhave witnessed what truly happened would establish that\n\non 31.12.2001, PW10 saw A5, A6, A7, A8, A11 and A14\n\nwhen he saw the deceased who was at that time tied up\n\non the first floor.     We notice indeed that A10 has been\n\nacquitted by the High Court, for which reason, stands\n\ngiven by the High Court.       Thus A5, A6, A7, A8, A11 and\n\nA14 are persons who can be and have also been convicted\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_235\">                               198</span>\n\fin    connection       with   the    illegal      confinement       of      the\n\ndeceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_270\">70.       A4, A7, A11, A14, A15, A16 and A17 are persons who\n\nhave been found guilty under <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_452\">Section 365</a> of the IPC.\n\nA3, A5, A6 and A8 stand convicted under <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_453\">Section 365</a> of\n\nthe IPC with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_454\">Section 109</a> of IPC.                         All of\n\nthem have also been convicted under <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_455\">Section 364</a> of the\n\nIPC.       In this regard there is a dichotomy involved.\n\nThe law attaches criminality to the act or omission by\n\na    person.      Another     person       may   become    liable      as   an\n\nabettor, a person who has conspired and thus liable\n\nunder Section 120B, a person who has shared a common\n\nobject and thus become vicariously liable and if there\n\nbe    5    or   more   persons      under    <a href=\"/doc/181136/\" id=\"a_456\">Section      141</a>   read     with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1060179/\" id=\"a_457\">Section 149</a> or if the principle of vicarious liability\n\nembedded in <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_458\">Section 34</a> of the IPC is attracted.                             In\n\nother words, for a conviction under Section 364 actual\n\nabduction is necessary.              A person could no doubt be\n\nliable under Section 364 read with <a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_459\">Section 34</a> or under\n\nSection 364 read with <a href=\"/doc/1060179/\" id=\"a_460\">Section 149</a> or under Section 364\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_236\">                                     199</span>\n\fread with <a href=\"/doc/1630403/\" id=\"a_461\">Section 109</a> or if he is found guilty under\n\nSection 120B.           In this case there is no scope for\n\neither 120B or 149.             However just as they have been\n\nfound guilty under Section 365 we would support the\n\nconviction under Section 364 in the same manner namely\n\nthe abduction within the meaning of Section 364.                             The\n\nabduction    is    alleged          to    have    been     taken     place    on\n\n30.12.2001. Be it remembered, that essence of abduction\n\nis forced movement, inter alia, from any place. The\n\noffence would be committed by any one who effects such\n\nabduction at any or all points of the route. We have\n\nalready noticed that in a given case, an abduction may\n\nattract both sections 364 and 365. The distinguishing\n\nfeature    between      the    two       kinds    of    abduction,     is    the\n\ndifference    in    the       intent       with    which    the     abduction,\n\ninter alia (as Sections 364 and 365 also deal with\n\nkidnapping),       is    carried          out.    But    so    far    as     the\n\nintention    attracts both               provisions in        a given      case,\n\nconviction under both sections is not impermissible.\n\nHowever,    when    some       of    the       appellants     are    convicted\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_237\">                                         200</span>\n\funder Section 365 simpliciter and others are convicted\n\nunder   Section   365    read   with   <a href=\"/doc/1630403/\" id=\"a_462\">Section     109</a>,   then     the\n\nposition   of   those    accused/     appellants    in    regard    to\n\nconviction under Section 364 must also be the same.\n\nHowever, this difference in our approach in the matter\n\nof   conviction under      Section 364,     cannot advance         the\n\ncase of the appellants, as abduction whether it is with\n\nthe aid of <a href=\"/doc/1630403/\" id=\"a_463\">Section 109</a> or which is under Section 364\n\nsimpliciter, enables the Court to raise the presumption\n\nof murder, in the absence of any explanation offered\n\nwithin the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_464\">Section 106</a> of the Evidence Act.\n\nIn other words, while we would find A4, A11, A15, A16\n\nand A17 guilty under Section 364 which is already found\n\nby the courts below, we would support the conviction\n\nunder Section 364 of other appellants on the basis that\n\nthey have been actively aided the abduction.               In other\n\nwords they would be guilty under Section 364 read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_465\">Section 109</a> IPC.        Also as far as A5, A6, A7, A8,             A11\n\nand A14 are concerned, there is the evidence of PW10\n\nthat when he saw the deceased in a clear state of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_238\">                                201</span>\n\fwrongful confinement, as he was found tied on the first\n\nfloor of the factory, A5, A6, A7, A8, A11 and A14 were\n\npresent. They have also been convicted under <a href=\"/doc/996413/\" id=\"a_466\">Sections\n\n347</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1688284/\" id=\"a_467\">387</a> of the IPC.            Also, in fact, we have already\n\nnoted that on 30.12.2001, PW11 has deposed about three\n\ncars out of which the deceased emerged out of one of\n\nthem, viz., the Ford Escort.                  A4, A11, A16 and A17 have\n\nbeen referred in the evidence of PW 11 as emerging out\n\nof the car along with the deceased but it is quite\n\nclear that there were more persons than A4, A11, A16\n\nand A17 who were involved in the abduction. In this\n\nregard    it     is     profitable       to    remember        that   PW3    has\n\nwitnessed three persons pushing another into a Maruti\n\nVan early in the morning on 30.12.2001.                        No doubt there\n\nis also a man on the Motorcycle.                     Within hours when he\n\nis brought to the factory building, he comes out of a\n\nFord     Escort.          There    were        two    other       cars   which\n\naccompanied      it.       We     must     bear      in   mind    that   under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/390542/\" id=\"a_468\">Section 362</a> of the IPC, abduction has been defined,\n\ninter    alia,     as    compelling       a    person     to     go   from   any\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_239\">                                     202</span>\n\fplace.    It,    no    doubt,       also   includes,       such     movement\n\nprocured by deceitful means. To make it more clear, if\n\nwe see the plot unravelling, viz., the abduction, the\n\nillegal confinement, the death of the deceased and his\n\nsubsequent cremation, the role of A3, A5, A6, A7, A8\n\nand A14 in aiding the abduction, appears to be made\n\nout.     It is also clear that A5, A6, A7, A8, A11 and A14\n\nwere     involved      in    the    wrongful      confinement        of    the\n\ndeceased. We, no doubt, noticed that as far as A14 is\n\nconcerned, there is no recovery, as such, effected from\n\nhim under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_469\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act and there is\n\nessentially      the evidence         of PW10,      as aforesaid.          The\n\nsame is position about A17, whose involvement has been\n\nreferred to by PW11, the other accomplice. We, however,\n\nfind that that the accomplice witnesses, who have been\n\nrelied    upon    by    two    courts,      are     to    be     treated   as\n\ncredible      witnesses       and,     even    in        the    absence     of\n\ncorroborative evidence, in the facts and circumstances\n\nof     this   case,     we    see    no    reason    to        disturb    that\n\nconviction. If that is so, even in the absence of any\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_240\">                                     203</span>\n\fdirect evidence relating to murder, the presumption of\n\nmurder, being committed by the appellants before us,\n\nwould apply.           In fact, the courts below have drawn a\n\npresumption       about murder        being committed.             This is    a\n\npresumption which cannot be said to be drawn without\n\nany basis. Having regard to the facts and circumstances\n\nbefore    us,     we    are    of   the     view    that      it   cannot    be\n\ncontended       that     no    case    is    made       out    against      the\n\nappellants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_271\">71.
