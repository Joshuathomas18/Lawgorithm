Challenge in this appeal is to the order passed by a\n\nlearned Single Judge of the Punjab and Haryana High Court\n\naccepting the prayer of respondent No.1 for quashing the\n\nproceedings pending before the Judicial Magistrate, First\n\nClass, Ludhiana. The proceedings related to the complaint\n\nfiled by the appellant      alleging commission of offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 138</a> of the Negotiable Instruments\n\nAct, 1881 (in short the `Act&#x27;).   In all, 8 petitions were filed\n\nwhich were disposed of by the common judgment.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.   The present appeals relate to Criminal Miscellaneous\n\nNo.52153 of 2002 and connected cases. The High Court\n\nquashed the proceedings primarily on the ground that\n\nrespondent No.1-Virsa Singh Sidhu in the first case had\n\nresigned from the Directorship before the cheques were\n\nissued. The other petitions were allowed on the ground that\n\nthere were some general allegations that all Directors were\n\nresponsible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                            2</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">\f4.   Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the\n\nHigh Court&#x27;s judgment is clearly unsustainable. So far as\n\nrespondent No.1 is concerned he claims to have resigned on\n\n2.4.1999 whereas cheques were issued on various dates vis in\n\nDecember 2000 and February 2001. It is pointed out that the\n\nForm No.32 which was required to be filed with the Registrar\n\nof Companies was filed on 5.7.2001 i.e. much after the\n\ncheques were issued. Whether in fact the respondent No.1&#x27;s\n\nclaim to have resigned was factually correct would have been\n\nestablished in trial and the High Court could not have passed\n\nthe impugned judgment while dealing with the application\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (in\n\nshort the `Code&#x27;)? It is further pointed out that the High Court\n\nwas not justified in holding that there was no specific\n\nallegation against other accused persons. With reference to\n\nthe complaint it was pointed out that specific allegation is to\n\nthe effect that the accused persons were in charge of day to\n\nday management work. In any event, this is not a question\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                            3</span>\n\fwhich could have been gone into in a proceeding under\n\nSection 482 of Code. It is a matter of trial.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">5.   Learned counsel for respondent No.1 on the other hand\n\nsubmitted that the High Court was justified in its view that\n\nrespondent No.1 had intimated the company about his desire\n\nto resign. If the company delayed in submitting the requisite\n\nform before the Registrar of Companies, he cannot be made to\n\nsuffer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">6.   As rightly contended by learned counsel for the appellant\n\nfactual disputes are involved. What was the effect of delayed\n\npresentation before the Registrar of Companies is essentially a\n\nmatter of trial. Whether respondent No.1 had intimated the\n\ncompany and whether there was any resolution accepting his\n\nresolution are matters in respect of which evidence has to be\n\nled. Therefore, the High Court was not justified in its view.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">7.   So far as allegations against the Directors are concerned\n\nabout their position in the company the complaint specifically\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                4</span>\n\fcontained the averments regarding the position of the accused\n\nDirectors in the company.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">8.   At this juncture, it would be relevant to take note of\n\ncertain observations made by this Court in various cases.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">9.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1794319\" id=\"span_4\">In <a href=\"/doc/1794319/\" id=\"a_3\">S.V. Muzumdar v.      Gujarat State Fertilizer Co. Ltd.\n\nand Anr.</a> (2005 (4) SCC 173), it was inter-alia observed as\n\nfollows:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           &quot;3. The facts as projected by the respondents\n           in the complaint were to the effect that the\n           respondent no.1 (hereinafter referred to as the\n           `complainant&#x27;) supplied goods on credit to M/s\n           Garware Nylons Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as\n           the `Company&#x27;) (accused no.14). Cheques\n           issued by the company were not honoured by\n           the drawee bank on the ground of insufficient\n           funds. Payments were not made even after\n           legal notices. There were 14 accused persons\n           including the company named in the\n           complaint. Some of the accused persons were\n           Directors and while others were employees.\n           Learned Chief Judicial Magistrate, Vadodara\n           after recording statement of marketing\n           manager who had filed the complaint for\n           himself and on behalf of the complainant-\n           company, issued summons to all the accused\n           persons for facing trial for alleged commission\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                             5</span>\n\fof offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 138</a> of\nthe Act read with <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 420</a> and <a href=\"/doc/112749/\" id=\"a_6\">114</a> of the\nIndian Penal Code, 1860 (in short the `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_7\">IPC</a>&#x27;).\nThe order issuing summons was challenged by\nfiling criminal revision applications which were\ndismissed by order dated 21.3.1996. Said\ncommon judgment and order was challenged\nbefore the High Court by filing special criminal\napplications and these applications were\npermitted to be withdrawn to enable the\nappellants to move applications before the\nlearned Chief Judicial Magistrate as stated by\nthe petitioners. Application was filed with\nprayer to drop proceedings. That application\nwas rejected by order dated 21.8.1997. Same\nwas questioned before the High Court. The\nchallenge before the High Court was primarily\non the ground that there was no material to\nshow that the accused persons at the time of\noffence as allegedly committed were in charge\nand/or responsible to the company for the\nconduct of the business as required under\n<a href=\"/doc/1755330/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 141(1)</a> of the Act.          It was also\nsubmitted that the deeming provision under\nsub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 141</a> which covers\npersons with whose consent or connivance or\nany attributable negligence for commission of\nthe offence by the company was also not\napplicable. The High Court did not accept the\npleas and held that the controversy was to be\nadjudicated at the trial. It considered the\npetition to be unacceptable attempt to stall the\ncriminal proceedings at the threshold.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">xx              xx              xx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">8.   We find that the prayers before the courts\nbelow essentially were to drop the proceedings\non the ground that the allegations would not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                   6</span>\n\fconstitute a foundation for action in terms of\n<a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 141</a> of the Act. These questions have\nto be adjudicated at the trial. Whether a\nperson is in charge of or is responsible to the\ncompany for conduct of business is to be\nadjudicated on the basis of materials to be\nplaced by the parties.       Sub-section (2) of\n<a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 141</a> is a deeming provision which as\nnoted supra operates in certain specified\ncircumstances. Whether the requirements for\nthe application of the deeming provision exist\nor not is again a matter for adjudication\nduring trial. Similarly, whether the allegations\ncontained are sufficient to attract culpability is\na matter for adjudication at the trial.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">9.   Under Scheme of the Act, if the person\ncommitting an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 138</a> of\nthe Act is a company, by application of <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_13\">Section\n141</a> it is deemed that every person who is in\ncharge of and responsible to the company for\nconduct of the business of the company as\nwell as the company are guilty of the offence.\nA person who proves that the offence was\ncommitted without his knowledge or that he\nhad exercised all due diligence is exempted\nfrom becoming liable by operation of the\nproviso to sub-section (1). The burden in this\nregard has to be discharged by the accused.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">10.

Whether or not the evidence to be led\n           would establish the accusations is a matter for\n           trial.

Therefore, a person in the commercial\n           world having a transaction with a company is\n           entitled to presume that the Directors of the\n           company are in charge of the affairs of the\n           company. If any restrictions on their powers\n           are placed by the memorandum or articles of\n           the company, it is for the Directors to establish\n           it at the trial. It is in that context that <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_17\">Section\n           141</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act provides\n           that when the offender is a company, every\n           person, who at the time when the offence was\n           committed was in charge of and was\n           responsible to the company for the conduct of\n           the business of the company, shall also be\n           deemed to be guilty of the offence along with\n           the company.
