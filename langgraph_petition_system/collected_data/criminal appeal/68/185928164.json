In all the aforesaid cases, it is held that in absence of\nmain charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 302</a> of IPC, if charge is\nappended of <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 149</a> of IPC then\nthe accused cannot be convicted for the main charge of\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 302</a> of IPC. However, such contention is not\nacceptable in the present case. In the present case, it is\napparent that the charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 302</a> of IPC was\nappended against the appellants Suresh Singh and Rajesh\nSingh. In para 99 of the judgment, on internal page 49, the\n                           9                 Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                            Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                            Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\ntrial court has convicted the appellants Suresh Singh and\nRajesh Singh for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 302</a> of IPC and\nconvicted the remaining accused persons for offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 149</a> of IPC. It appears that\nby mistake while dealing with the matter for sentence in\npara 119 of the judgment, it is mentioned that appellants\nRajesh Singh and Hukum Singh are punished with a\nparticular sentence for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 302</a> of IPC\nand it appears that by typing mistake name of Suresh\nSingh was replaced by Hukum Singh. Hence, it is not a\nmistake of non-framing of charges. The charge of <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_26\">Section\n302</a> of IPC relating to deceased Govind Singh was framed\nagainst each of the appellants, namely, Suresh Singh and\nRajesh Singh and in para 99 of the judgment only those\ntwo persons have been convicted of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_27\">Section\n302</a> of IPC, hence, looking to the factual difference, the\naforesaid judgments are not applicable to the present case.\nSince appellant Hukum Singh was convicted for offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 149</a> of IPC in para 99\nof the judgment then there was no dispute relating to his\ncharges and conviction.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">(12) This case is having sufficient number of injured\npersons and sufficient number of accused persons and\ntherefore   in   order   to   avoid   the    complexity      of   the\ndiscussion, it would be appropriate to consider the points\nin a sequence. It should be considered as to whether the\ndeath of the deceased Govind Singh was homicidal in\nnature? Whether victims Raghuveer Singh Raghuvanshi\n(PW-2), Vijay @ Mannu (PW-11), Uttam Singh (PW-8) and\nShivram Singh (PW-4) have sustained any fatal injury. It is\nto be examined as to who assaulted the particular victim\n                          10               Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                          Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                          Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nand what is the crime constituted against that person who\nassaulted the particular victim. Thereafter, whether the\nappellants could be convicted for the aforesaid offences\nwith the help of common intention or common object and\nwhether unlawful assembly was constituted and some of\nthe persons had deadly weapons in that unlawful assembly.\n(13) Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW-15) has performed the post\nmortem on the body of the deceased Govind Singh and\ngave a report Ex.P-14. He found 25 firearm wounds on the\nbody of the deceased caused by pellets. Three pellets were\nfound in the body of the deceased and those were removed\nand given to the police for their ballistic examination.\nHeart, brain, both the lungs, liver and omentum were\nfound damaged due to impact of pellets and therefore due\nto damage of these vital parts of the body, deceased\nGovind Singh died. According to Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW-15),\ndeath of the deceased Govind Singh was homicidal in\nnature. There is no reason to disbelieve Dr. P.K. Sharma\n(PW-15) and hence looking to so many injuries, death of\nthe deceased Govind Singh is proved to be homicidal in\nnature. Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW-15) examined victims Uttam\nSingh (PW-8), Raghuveer Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-2), Vijay\n@ Mannu (PW-11) and gave his reports Ex.P-64 to P-66.\nAccording to him Uttam Singh (PW-8) sustained four\ninjuries of firearm on his right buttock whereas five\nwounds were found on his chest and abdomen. Wounds\nwere also found on left forearm and right elbow. Victim\nUttam   Singh   (PW-8)        was   referred   for   radiological\nexamination. Dr. Sitaram Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-19)\nexamined him radiologically and gave his report Ex.P-131.\nNo fracture was found to the victim Uttam Singh (PW-8)\n                         11             Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                       Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                       Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nwhereas one radio opaque shadow was found on the right\nelbow. Two such shadows were found on abdomen. Two\nsuch shadows were found on the pelvic region and one on\nthe chest. Such shadows should be caused due to presence\nof small pellets.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">(14) Dr. Ganesh Sugra (PW-22), CMO, at Choithram\nHospital, Indore (M.P.) examined Uttam Singh (PW-8) and\ngave a report Ex.P-138. He found various wounds caused\nby pellets but he did not mention as to whether Uttam\nSingh (PW-8) would have died due to such injuries or not.\nNo bed-head ticket or surgical report was submitted by\nany of the doctors to show that any vital part of the injured\nUttam Singh was damaged. Out of all the doctors like Dr.\nP.K. Sharma (PW-15), Dr. Sitaram Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">19) and Dr. Ganesh Sugra (PW-22), none has opined that\ninjuries caused to the victim Uttam Singh (PW-8) were\nfatal in nature. Hence, the prosecution has failed to prove\nthat injuries caused to victim Uttam Singh (PW-8) were\nfatal in nature.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">(15) Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW-15) has also examined the victim\nRaghuveer Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-2) and gave his report\nEx.P-65. One firearm injury was found near his left eye.\nTwo injuries on right chest, four injuries on left upper arm\nand four injuries on right arm were found by Dr. P.K.,\nSharma (PW-15) which could be caused by pellets. Dr.\nSitaram Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-19) examined the injured\nRaghuveer Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-2) radiologically and\ngave his report Ex.P-125. He found nine radio opaque\nshadows on the corresponding portion of the body where\nDr. P.K. Sharma (PW-15) found the injuries of pellets,\nhowever, no fracture was found to the victim Raghuveer\n                                12             Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                              Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                              Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nSingh Raghuvanshi (PW-2). Raghuveer Singh Raghuvanshi\n(PW-2) was also referred to Choithram Hospital, Indore,\nhowever, Dr. Ganesh Sugra did not opine in his report Ex.P-\n137 that any of the injuries caused to the victim Raghuveer\nSingh Raghuvanshi (PW-2) was fatal in nature. No bed-\nhead ticket or surgical report was produced before the\ntrial court to show that some surgery was done to the\nvictim Raghuveer Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-2) or any vital\npart      of   his    body    was   found   damaged,     hence,     the\nprosecution has failed to prove that the victim Raghuveer\nSingh Raghuvanshi (PW-2)             sustained any fatal or grave\ninjury.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">(16) Similarly, Dr. Manish Jain (PW-5) examined injured\nShivram Singh (PW-4) and gave his report Ex.P-8. He found\none lacerated wound 7 cms above left heel, one lacerated\nwound          on    left   knee.   Shivram   Singh     (PW-4)      was\ncomplaining of pain on right shoulder but no injury was\nfound. According to Dr. Manish Jain (PW-5), injuries caused\nto Shivram Singh (PW-4) were simple in nature. It is not\nmentioned by Dr. Manish Jain (PW-5) that any of the\ninjuries caused to the victim Shivram Singh (PW-4)                 was\ncaused by gunshot. Shivram Singh (PW-4) was not referred\nfor his radiological examination or admission. Hence, it\nwould be apparent that the victim Shivram Singh (PW-4)\nsustained simple injuries.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">(17) Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW-5) examined the victim Vijay\nSingh @ Mannu (PW-11) and gave his report Ex.P-66. One\nfirearm injury was found on his left cheek whereas blood\nwas oozing from his nose. Five such injuries were found on\nright shoulder. Two injuries were found on left abdomen\nand one or two injuries were found on left thigh. Dr. P.K.\n                             13              Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                            Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                            Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nSharma (PW-5) referred the victim, Vijay Singh @ Mannu\n(PW-11) to ENT specialist because blood was oozing from\nhis nose. However, no report of ENT specialist was\nsubmitted.    On      the   other   hand,   Dr.   Sitaram      Singh\nRaghuvanshi (PW-19) who performed the X-ray of victim\nVijay Singh @ Mannu (PW-11) and gave his report Ex.P-\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">117. He found that some radio opaque shadows were\npresent below the wounds described by Dr. P.K. Sharma\n(PW-15). Some air was collected on upper lobe on the right\nlung   of    victim     Vijay    Singh      @   Mannu       (PW-11).\nHaemorrhagic fluid was present on right chest, however,\nsuch opinion was not confirmed by any surgical specialist.\nDr. Ganesh Sugra (PW-22) examined Vijay Singh @ Mannu\n(PW-11) and gave a report Ex.P-136. He repeated the\nopinion given by Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW-15). According to Dr.\nP.K. Sharma (PW-15) except the symptom of blood oozing\nfrom the nose of Vijay Singh @ Mannu, all the remaining\ninjuries were simple in nature. In the absence of any bed-\nhead ticket or surgical report, it can not be established\nthat Vijay Singh @ Mannu sustained any fatal or grave\ninjury. No fracture was found on any portion of his body.\nNo ENT specialist was examined to show that blood was\noozing from the nose of victim Vijay Singh @ Mannu due to\nany internal injury of brain etc. Hence, the prosecution has\nfailed to prove that the victim Vijay Singh @ Mannu\nsustained any fatal or grave injury and therefore his\ninjuries shall be counted as simple injuries.\n(18) Dr. Manish Jain (PW-5) examined Babulal, Parmal\nSingh (PW-13), Ravindra Singh, Ratan Singh and Manna\nand gave his reports Ex.P-9 to P-13. According to Dr.\nManish Jain (PW-5), all the injuries of these persons were\n                        14            Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                     Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                     Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nsimple in nature. These injuries were either abrasions or\nlacerated wounds. According to him, Babulal sustained a\nlacerated wound on his head and he made complaint of\npain on right buttock but no injury was found. Parmal\nSingh (PW-13) sustained a lacerated wound on right palm\nin between the palm and thumb that was simple in nature.\nRavindra Singh sustained two abrasions on right leg.\nThose were simple in nature. Ratan Singh sustained mainly\ntwo injuries; one incised wound was found on right knee of\nRatan Singh and above that wound there were three\nparallel lacerated wounds. One abrasion was found on his\nleft knee. He was making complaint of pain on left leg but\nnothing was found in that leg. He found two injuries to\nvictim Manna. One lacerated wound was found on right\npalm and another one was found on right temporal and\noccipital region. According to Dr. Manish Jain (M.P.), one\ninjury of victim Ratan Singh was found to be caused by\nsharp cutting weapon whereas all the injuries of these\nvictims were caused by hard and blunt objects.\n(19)   Witness Bhupendra Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-1),\nRaghuveer Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-2), Manna (PW-3),\nShivram Singh (PW-4), Uttam Singh (PW-8), Vijay Singh @\nMannu (PW-11) and Parmal Singh (PW-13) etc. were\nexamined as eyewitnesses. All of them have categorically\nstated that on exhortation extended by appellants Anant\nSingh and Onkar Singh, first of all, appellant Suresh Singh\nfired with a 12-bore gun and injury was caused on the\nchest of deceased Govind Singh. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"567993\" id=\"span_28\">Again when Govind Singh\ntried to stand up appellant Rajesh Singh again fired upon\nhim causing injury on his chest and head and thereafter\ndeceased Govind Singh again fell down on the ground and\n                         15                Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                          Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                          Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\ndied. There is no any contradiction in the evidence given\nby all these eyewitnesses so that there is a difference in\ntheir story. Learned counsel for the appellants Suresh\nSingh and Rajesh Singh has submitted that according to\nFIR Ex.P-2, complainant Bhupendra Singh Raghuvanshi\n(PW-1) went to the police station along with Akhilesh Singh\nand Jaswant Singh and those were not examined by the\nprosecution and therefore an adverse inference be drawn\nagainst the prosecution. He has also relied upon the\njudgment passed by the Apex Court in the case of &quot;<a href=\"/doc/567993/\" id=\"a_30\">Brijpal\nSingh Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>&quot; [2004 SCC (Cri)\n90] in which it is held that non-examination of independent\nwitnesses present at the spot creates a doubt in the\nprosecution story.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"535683\" id=\"span_31\">Reliance is also placed on the judgment\npassed by the Apex Court in the <a href=\"/doc/535683/\" id=\"a_31\">Case of &quot;Lallu Manjhi\nand another Vs. State of Jharkhand</a>&quot; [AIR 2003 SC\n854] in which it is held that if the sole eyewitness was\ninterested   being   brother   of   the   deceased      then     his\ntestimony can be accepted if it is corroborated fully by the\nmedical evidence and therefore, no conviction can be\nsustained on the basis of the interested witnesses.\nHowever, submissions made by the learned counsel for the\nappellants Suresh Singh and Rajesh Singh cannot be\naccepted. Initially, in the FIR Ex.P-2 it was mentioned that\ncomplainant Bhupendra Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-1) went to\nthe police station along with Akhilesh Singh and Jaswant\nSingh and he did not mention that those were the\neyewitnesses. In the end of FIR, he has expressed that\nAkhilesh Singh was present at the spot at the time of\nincident but he did not mention that Jaswant Singh was\nalso present at the time of incident. In the present case,\n                         16                Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                          Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                          Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nthere were so many persons who sustained injuries and it\nis the settled principle of the Apex Court that number of\nwitnesses is not important to prove a case. All of the\neyewitnesses are not required to be examined.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"567993\" id=\"span_34\">It is not\nproved by the appellants that Akhilesh Singh and Jaswant\nSingh   were   not   the     relatives   of   Bhupendra       Singh\nRaghuvanshi (PW-1) or those were not the interested\nwitnesses, hence, the law <a href=\"/doc/535683/\" id=\"a_32\">laid down by</a> the Hon&#x27;ble Apex\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/567993/\" id=\"a_33\">Brijpal</a> (supra) cannot be applied.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"535683\" id=\"span_35\">Similarly, since it is a case of multiple eyewitnesses, out of\nthem, so many witnesses are injured witnesses and\ntherefore, the judgment passed by the Apex Court in the\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/535683/\" id=\"a_34\">Lallu Manjhi</a> (supra) relating to sole eyewitness\ncannot be applied in the present case.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1038933\" id=\"span_36\">(20) Learned counsel for the appellants Suresh Singh and\nRajesh Singh has also submitted that if marg intimation\nEx.P-1 and FIR Ex.P-2 are compared then both the\ndocuments are shown to be written at the same time\nwhereas it was not possible for the police officer to write\ndown    both   the   documents      simultaneously      and    also\ncompliance under <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 157</a> of Cr.P.C. is not established\nby the prosecution and possibility cannot be ruled out that\ninitially a marg intimation was registered and later on the\nFIR was registered by due deliberations etc and therefore\ncompliance of <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 157</a> of Cr.P.C. was essential.

State of Uttar Pradesh</a>&quot; [1995 Cri.L.J. 457]\nin support of the aforesaid submissions. The contention\nadvanced by the learned counsel for the appellants Suresh\nSingh and Rajesh Singh cannot be accepted. If various\ncolumns of marg intimation and FIR are examined then\ncolumn about date and time of intimation is shown in both\nthe documents. In that column, it is not mentioned that\ndate and time of document be mentioned when the\ndocument    was   written.   When   FIR   was     lodged     by\ncomplainant Bhupendra Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-1) then\nduring writing of that FIR police officer knew that Govind\nSingh had expired and therefore while recording the FIR\nhe had received the information about the death of the\ndeceased Govind Singh and therefore in the column of date\nand time of intimation, date and time when information\nreceived by the police should be written and hence it\nwould be the same in the FIR as well as in the marg\nintimation. It is not accepted by the police officer who had\nwritten the FIR that marg intimation was written prior to\nthe FIR. Hence, when intimation of crime committed by\nthe appellants and death of the deceased Govind Singh\nwas received by the police at the same time then the police\nis bound to write down the same date and time in both the\ndocuments. This fact is immaterial that how much time\nwas consumed in recording the FIR and how much time\nwas consumed in recording the marg intimation because\nthere was no such column in either document so that such\ntime be mentioned which was consumed in writing of\n                           18               Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                           Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                           Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\ndocument. Under these circumstances, contention of\nlearned counsel for the appellants Suresh Singh and\nRajesh Singh has no effect on the prosecution&#x27;s case.\n(21) So far as compliance of <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 157</a> of Cr.P.C. is\nconcerned, it is the settled view of the Apex Court that it\nwould be hyper-technical for the trial court or the\nappellate court to reject every FIR if compliance of\nprovision under <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 157</a> of Cr.P.C. is not established.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1825522\" id=\"span_43\">It\nis held in the case of &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1825522/\" id=\"a_43\">State of U.P.

Learned counsel for the appellants\nSuresh Singh and Rajesh Singh has submitted that since\nno complete data is given in the marg intimation Ex.P-1,\ntherefore, it shall be presumed that the FIR Ex.P-22 was\nante-time and written much after the marg intimation.\nHowever, according to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_44\">Code of\nCriminal Procedure</a> while recording the marg intimation,\nonly sufficient facts relating to death of the deceased are\nrequired to be shown and it is not necessary to give the\ndescription of any crime committed whereas in the FIR the\ndescription is to be given as to how the crime was\ncommitted. When the marg intimation Ex.P-1 and the FIR\nEx.P-2 were written at the same time then only by the fact\nthat    no   detailed   description   is   given   in   the    marg\nintimation, it cannot be said that FIR was ante time.

According to the\neyewitnesses, appellants Suresh Singh fired with a 12-bore\ngun and injuries were caused on the chest and thereafter\nappellant Rajesh Singh fired with a gun and injuries were\ncaused on the chest as well as on the remaining portion of\nthe body.

Narendra\nSingh Choudhary (DW-5) who proved the report Ex.P-141\nhas accepted that he cannot give a specific opinion that\nthe live or missed fire cartridges sent for examination\ncould be fired again from various guns or not. He has also\naccepted that three pellets which were found in the body\nof the deceased Govind Singh could be fired by a gun\nwhich was marked as A-3 and according to the report Ex.P-\n141, the gun allegedly recovered from Hukum Singh was\nmarked as A-3. Hence, it is submitted that there is a\ncontradiction between the ocular evidence and report of\nballistic expert.

Similarly, on fire bullet marks of\nbarrel may be obtained and if such marks of barrel are\nfound on the piece of bullet found inside the body of\nsomeone then the comparison may be possible that\nwhether such bullet was fired with a particular gun or not.\nIn case of 12-bore gun, a cartridge of 12-bore may be fired\nby a single barreled 12-bore gun, a double barreled 12-\nbore gun or pistol of 12-bore. It can never be ascertained\nwhether there would be a one piece of lead or different\npellets would be found in such cartridge. There is no hard\nand fast rule that particular number or particular size of\npellet or particular number of pellet would be filled up in a\nparticular cartridge of 12-bore gun. It is possible that all\nthe pellets filled up by a particular company may be of\nequal size and those may not be of equal size but this fact\nis positive that if a cartridge is prepared to be fired with a\n12 bore gun then it may be fired by longer barrel gun as\nwell as a handmade pistol of 12-bore and therefore if the\nballistic expert has stated that those pellets which were\nfound in the body of the deceased Govind Singh could be\nfired by a gun A-3 that was allegedly recovered from\nHukum Singh then he did not give such an opinion that\nthese pellets could not be fired by the guns held by Suresh\nSingh and Rajesh Singh. If post mortem report Ex.P-14\nproved by Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW-15) is considered then as\nmany as 25 injuries of pellets were found to the deceased\nGovind Singh and therefore such injuries were caused by\nfiring from 12-bore guns, hence, the opinion given by\nballistic expert Narendra Singh Choudhary (DW-5) does\nnot help the appellants in any manner whatsoever. The\naforesaid judgments passed by the Apex Court are not\n                         23             Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                       Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                       Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\napplicable in the present case due to different factual\npositions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">(25) Learned counsel for the appellants Suresh Singh and\nRajesh Singh have also submitted that seizure of guns from\nthe appellants Suresh Singh and Rajesh Singh is highly\ndoubtful. But in the present case where so many accused\npersons have used 12-bore guns causing injuries to various\npersons and so many victims have sustained injuries of\npellets fired by the 12-bore gun therefore if a 12-bore gun\nis recovered from any accused then it makes no difference.\nIt cannot be said positively by the report of FSL that\nparticular cartridge was fired by a particular gun and the\nfiring mark of barrel can be found on the piece of lead\navailable in the body of any victim. In case of 12-bore gun,\nno such mark can be seen on any of the pellets where the\ncartridge was filled up by so many pellets. Hence, by\nseizure of a gun offence under <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 25</a> of the Arms Act\nmay constitute but it cannot be said definitely that fire was\ndone by the same gun which was recovered and therefore\npresent case is to be considered without giving much\nweight to the report Ex.P-141 given by the FSL.\n(26) Learned counsel for the appellants Suresh Singh and\nRajesh Singh has submitted that according to the spot map\nand recovery, one used empty cartridge was found 100 ft\naway from the spot and no other cartridge could be\nrecovered by the police. Looking to the distance of the\ncartridge it cannot be said that both the fires were done\nwith the gun or were fired with a distance of 100 ft. Such\nsubmission is not acceptable in the case. It is proved by\nvarious doctors that so many persons have sustained\ninjuries of pellets fired by more than one person. It can be\n                          24              Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                         Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                         Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nsaid because some blackening etc was found by Dr. P.K.\nSharma (PW-15) on the injuries of Uttam Singh (PW-8)\nwhereas no blackening etc was found on the body of\ndeceased Govind Singh. So many injuries of pellets were\nfound to various victims and such injuries could not be\ncaused by a single shot. Blackening may be caused if fire is\ndone with a distance of 4-5 ft and no blackening would be\nfound if fire is done from a distant place. Looking to the\nblackening found on the wounds of victim Uttam Singh\n(PW-8) and as no blackening was found on the wounds of\nremaining persons it would be apparent that at least one\nfire was made with a distance of 4-5 ft and other fires were\nmade from a longer distance. Police reported at the spot\nafter sometime and therefore there was possibility for the\nappellants to remove the empty cartridges from the spot or\nthey also had an opportunity to change the distance of\nempty cartridge which was found on the spot, hence, if\nonly one empty cartridge was found at the spot with a\ndistance of 100 ft then it gives no advantage to the\nappellants whereas evidence of eyewitnesses is duly\ncorroborated by the timely lodged FIR Ex.P-2 and post\nmortem report Ex.P-14 proved by Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW-15).\n(27) Learned counsel for the appellants has submitted\nthat if there is a contradiction between the statements of\nwitnesses recorded under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 161</a> of Cr.P.C. and their\nstatements recorded before the court then a deliberate\nchange creates a doubt. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"51359270\" id=\"span_65\">In this connection, the judgment\npassed by the Apex Court in the case of &quot;<a href=\"/doc/51359270/\" id=\"a_57\">Shingara Singh\nVs.

He has read out the evidence of Ghanshyam\n                            26                Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                             Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                             Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nRaghuvanshi (DW-4) to show that the complainant and his\ncompanions were fully armed and they initiated criminal\nactivity, however, such evidence is not acceptable because\nif 5-6 persons armed with guns etc had attacked the\nappellants already then some cartridges should have been\nfound near the spot as told by witness Ghanshyam\nRaghuvanshi (DW-4), an FIR would have been lodged by\nthe injured persons and they would have been examined by\nthe doctor. It is not possible that the complainant and his\ncompanions fired with the guns and assaulted various\nvictims and no-one sustained any injury. No counter FIR or\nno medico-legal report of any of the appellants was\nproduced before the trial court. Hence, the story told by\nGhanshyam       Raghuvanshi         (DW-4)        appears     to    be\nhypothetical which cannot be accepted. The appellants\nhave failed to prove that any right of private defence had\naccrued to them.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">(29) Learned counsel for the appellants Suresh Singh and\nRajesh Singh has also submitted that there was no\nintention of the appellants to kill the deceased Govind\nSingh. There was no previous enmity proved by the\nprosecution between the parties. It is true that enmity\nbetween   the    parties    could    not     be    proved     by   the\nprosecution because apparently there was no previous\nenmity as such between Govind Singh and Rajesh Singh or\nSuresh Singh, however, motive is ingredient which can be\nan additional circumstance in the chain of circumstantial\nevidence if it is proved. Sometimes, it is not possible to\nknow the motive of the accused who killed the deceased\nand therefore motive is not an essential ingredient to prove\nthe offence of murder. In the present case, initially, hot\n                         27             Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                       Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                       Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\ntalks took place between Ram Singh and complainant\nBhupendra     Singh   Raghuvanshi    (PW-1)   and     therefore\nappellants would have reached the spot to cause harm to\ncomplainant    Bhupendra     Singh    Raghuvanshi        (PW-1)\nwhereas after reaching the spot appellants Suresh Singh\nand Rajesh Singh aimed at the deceased Govind Singh and\nfired on his chest. If they had appeared in the scene of\ncrime to commit offence against complainant Bhupendra\nSingh Raghuvanshi (PW-1) then it was not possible for\nthem to aim Govind Singh. Repeated firing done by Rajesh\nSingh after Suresh Singh on vital parts of the body of the\ndeceased Govind Singh clearly indicates that they had\nintended to kill the deceased Govind Singh. If initially\nGovind Singh was not the target of mob then there was no\nneed to the appellant Suresh Singh to fire upon the\ndeceased Govind Singh. He would have fired upon\ncomplainant Bhupendra Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-1) but he\nstarted firing with a 12-bore gun, on the chest of the\ndeceased Govind Singh and when he again stood up,\nsecond fire was made by Rajesh Singh on his chest and\nupper portion of the body. Hence, looking to the conduct as\nestablished by the prosecution before the trial court\nclearly indicates that the appellants Suresh Singh and\nRajesh Singh had an intention to kill the deceased Govind\nSingh. Initially, appellant Suresh Singh fired with a gun\ncausing fatal injuries to the deceased Govind Singh on\nvarious vital parts like chest and Govind Singh would have\ndied due to such fatal injuries on lungs, liver and heart.\nAgain, Rajesh Singh fired with the gun causing injury on\nbrain of the deceased Govind Singh. One pellet was also\nfound in the brain. Under these circumstances, the\n                        28             Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nappellants Suresh Singh and Rajesh Singh had not only\ncaused fatal injuries to the deceased Govind Singh but also\nthey had intended to kill him and therefore the trial court\nhas rightly convicted them of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 302</a> of\nIPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">(30) So far as the injuries of victims Raghuveer Singh\nRaghuvanshi (PW-2), Vijay Singh @ Mannu (PW-11), Uttam\n(PW-8 and Shivram Singh (PW-4) are concerned, as\ndiscussed above, none of their injuries was found to be\nfatal. Though it is stated by Dr. Sitaram Singh Raghuvanshi\n(PW-19) that some air was found collected above the right\nlung of victim Vijay Singh @ Mannu (PW-11) due to hole on\nthe lung but thereafter it could not be proved that such\ninjury was either grievous or fatal and therefore since no\nsurgery was done and no doctor has given any opinion\nabout the injury to be fatal or grave then it shall be\npresumed that the prosecution could not prove the injuries\nof Vijay Singh @ Mannu (PW-11) to be fatal or grave. There\nare allegations of various witnesses as to who assaulted\nwhom and with which weapon but when so many accused\npersons have fired and so many victims have sustained\ninjuries it was difficult for every eyewitness to locate all\nthe assaults with their respective victims and accused and\ntherefore if such contradiction in the evidence of witnesses\narrives then it cannot be said to be material. If the victim\nwho sustained injuries knows that who caused injuries to\nhim, then the evidence of such witness can be accepted as\nit is. Raghuveer Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-2) has stated\nabout the injuries caused to the deceased Govind Singh\nand thereafter he told that Chandu @ Chandrabhan\nassaulted him with a ballam causing injuries on his right\n                         29                  Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                            Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                            Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nfingers and left side of his head but Dr. P.K. Sharma (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"528730\" id=\"span_80\">15)   who    examined        the   victim     Raghuveer        Singh\nRaghuvanshi (PW-2) in his MLC report Ex.P-65 did not find\nany such injury and therefore it cannot be accepted that\nappellant Chandu @ Chandrabhan assaulted the victim\nRaghuveer    Singh   Raghuvanshi        (PW-2)       with    ballam.\nWitness Raghuveer Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-2) has also\nstated that Hukum Singh fired with a gun and he sustained\nso many injuries of pellets. This version was proved by Dr.\nP.K. Sharma (PW-15) in MLC report Ex.P-65 where 10 to 11\nfirearm injuries were found on his person viz. near the left\neye, on the right chest, left upper arm and right arm. Such\nversion was also mentioned in the FIR and therefore it is\nproved beyond doubt that appellant Hukum Singh fired\nwith a gun causing simple injuries to the victim Raghuveer\nSingh Raghuvanshi (PW-2). Hence, in the light of the\njudgments passed by the Apex Court in the case of\n&quot;<a href=\"/doc/528730/\" id=\"a_66\">Pashora Singh and another Vs. State of Punjab</a>&quot;</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1124581\" id=\"span_81\">[AIR 1993 SC 1256], &quot;Parsuram Pandey and others\nVs.

The\nappellant Hukum Singh did not repeat his fire upon the\nvictim Raghuveer Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-2) and therefore\nhe did not intend to kill him and therefore the act of\nappellant Hukum Singh relating to victim Raghuveer Singh\nRaghuvanshi (PW-2) shall fall within the purview of <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_68\">Section\n324</a> of IPC and not under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 307</a> of IPC.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(31) Witness Vijay Singh @ Mannu (PW-11) has stated that\ninitially Lallu @ Surendra Singh fired upon him and\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">                        30             Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nthereafter Pancham Singh fired upon him and he sustained\nvarious injuries of pellets.

Hence, the evidence of Vijay Singh\n@ Mannu (PW-11) is acceptable that appellants Lallu @\nSurendra Singh and Pancham Singh fired upon him\ncausing simple injuries to him and on the same logic as\nmentioned for victim Raghuveer Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">2), the appellants Lallu @ Surendra Singh and Pancham\nSingh would be liable for offence under <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 324</a> of IPC\nonly, however, since the appellant Pancham Singh has\nexpired during the pendency of the appeal, therefore, only\nappellant Lallu @ Surendra Singh shall be liable for\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 324</a> of IPC for the injuries caused to\nthe victim Vijay Singh @ Mannu (PW-11).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">(32) Victim Uttam Singh (PW-8) has stated that appellants\nVishnu Raghuvanshi and Bhure Singh fired with 12-bore\nguns causing injuries to him and one Banti @ Hindu Singh\nassaulted him with Farsa causing injury on left elbow,\nhowever, according to the MLC report Ex.P-64 proved by\nDr. P.K.

Dr. Manish Jain\n(PW-5) proved the MLC report of victim Shivram Singh\n(PW-4) as Ex.P-8. He found one lacerated wound 7 cm\nabove the left heel and one lacerated wound below the left\nknee. The size of the first wound was 1/2 x 1/2 cms and the\nsize of second wound was 2 x 1 cms. Hence, the wound\ncaused below the left knee could not be caused by firing. It\ncould be caused by assault done by Dalup @ Dilip Singh\nwith a stick. Though Dr. Manish Jain (PW-5) did not\nexpress as to whether the injury found 7 cms above left\nheel was caused by firearm and whether blackening or\ncharring would be found, if fire was done from a distance\nof more than 5 ft. If pellet would not have struck directly in\nthe deep skin then doctor cannot say definitely as to\nwhether injury was caused by firearm or not. Thus,\ncorroboration of medical report Ex.P-8 Shivram Singh (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">4) has sustained gunshot injury just above his left heel and\nstick injury below left knee, hence when his statement is\ncorroborated by other eyewitnesses, FIR Ex.P-2 and MLC\nreport Ex.P-8 proved by Dr. Manish Jain (PW-5), it is\nproved that the appellant Hariom fired with a gun causing\nsimple injury to the victim Shivram Singh (PW-4) whereas\nDalup @ Dilip Singh assaulted him with a stick causing\n                        32                 Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                          Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                          Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nsimple injury. On the basis of logic, as discussed above,\nHariom shall be liable for offence under Section 324 of IPC\nand Dalup @ Dilip Singh shall be liable for offence under\nSection 323 of IPC in relation to victim Shivram Singh (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">4).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">(34) None other victim was considered for offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 307</a> of IPC, however, the other injured witnesses\nmay also be considered for their injuries and the co-\nrelative accused who assaulted them. Dr. Manish Jain (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">5) has proved the MLC report Ex.P-10 relating to victim\nParmal Singh (PW-13) and found a lacerated wound on his\nright palm between the palm and thumb. According to Dr.\nManish Jain (PW-5) the injury found to the victim Parmal\nSingh (PW-13) was simple in nature. Parmal Singh (PW-13)\nhas stated that accused Radheshyam assaulted him with\nballam which caused injury on his right palm near thumb\nand there was a wound which was stitched by the doctor.\nHe did not state that appellant Radheshyam stabbed the\nballam on his right palm and therefore it is possible that\npointed portion of ballam would not have caused any injury\nto the victim Parmal Singh (PW-13), however, if pointed\nportion of the ballam had touched the skin of victim Parmal\nSingh (PW-13) so that skin was lacerated then wound could\nbe    caused.   Evidence    of   Parmal    Singh     (PW-13)      is\ncorroborated by other eyewitnesses along with FIR Ex.P-2\nand medical report Ex.P-10 proved by Dr. Manish Jain and\ntherefore it is established that the accused/appellant\nRadheshyam is liable for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 323</a> of IPC\ncausing simple injuries to victim Parmal Singh (PW-13).\n(35) Dr. Manish Jain (PW-5) has proved the MLC report\nEx.P-13 of victim Manna (PW-3). According to Dr. Jain,\n                         33             Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                       Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                       Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nthere were two simple injuries to the victim Manna (PW-3);\none was lacerated wound on his right palm and second was\na blunt injury on right temporal and occipital region of size\n12x1 cms. Manna (PW-3) has stated that Setu @ Satendra\nSingh gave a blow of Farsa on his head and Neta @\nNarendra gave a blow of ballam causing injury on his right\npalm. It is true that the Farsa and Ballam are the sharp\ncutting and stabbing weapons respectively and it is not\nmentioned by Manna (PW-3) that Neta @ Narendra\nstabbed the ballam in his palm and therefore if ballam was\nnot stabbed and it was used to cause injury otherwise then\nsuch injury could be caused to the victim Manna (PW-3) as\nproved by Dr. Manish Jain (PW-5). Similarly, if farsa was\nnot so sharp, such lacerated wound would have been\ncaused on his right temporal and occipital region. Looking\nto the size of wound it is also possible that if Farsa was not\nso sharp such lacerated wound could be caused. Evidence\ngiven by Manna (PW-3) is duly corroborated by MLC report\nEx.P-13 proved by Dr. Manish Jain (PW-5). His statement is\nalso corroborated by other eyewitnesses. Hence, on the\nbasis of aforesaid logic, appellant Setu @ Satendra Singh\nand Neta @ Narendra shall be liable for offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 323</a> of IPC to voluntarily cause hurt to the victim\nManna (PW-3).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_36\">(36) Similarly, if injuries of victim Ratan Singh are\nconsidered then Dr. Manish Jain (PW-5) has proved his\nMLC report Ex.P-12. According to him, Ratan Singh\nsustained incised wound on the joint of right knee and it\nwas followed by three lacerated wounds. Those were one\nupon the other and one abrasion was found on his left\nknee. The injured Ratan Singh was not examined by the\n                          34                 Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                                            Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                            Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nprosecution,   however,       complainant     Bhupendra        Singh\nRaghuvanshi (PW-1) and other eyewitnesses have stated\nthat Ram Singh assaulted victim Ratan Singh with a stick\nbut no-one has stated that any of the appellants has\nassaulted the victim Ratan Singh with a sharp cutting\nweapon. Hence, when it is not established that any of the\nappellants assaulted the victim Ratan Singh with sharp\ncutting weapon no-one can be convicted for the injury\nvoluntarily caused by sharp cutting weapon, however, on\nthe basis of the logic as mentioned above, appellant Ram\nSingh is liable for offence of voluntarily causing hurt to the\nvictim under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 323</a> of IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">(37) Similarly, Dr. Manish Jain (PW-5) has proved the MLC\nreport Ex.P-11 of the victim Ravindra Singh. According to\nDr. Jain, Ravindra Singh sustained two minor abrasions on\nhis right leg. Out of them one was on right knee. Ravindra\nSingh was not examined by the prosecution, however, if\nevidence    given   by    complainant         Bhupendra        Singh\nRaghuvanshi (PW-1) and other eyewitnesses is considered\nthen Ram Singh assaulted Ravindra Singh causing such\ninjuries. Looking to the corroborative evidence of various\ninjured eyewitnesses it is proved that Ram Singh had\nvoluntarily caused injuries to victim Ravindra Singh and\ntherefore he is liable for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 323</a> of IPC\nfor victim Ravindra Singh.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">(38) Dr. Manish Jain (PW-5) has proved the MLC report\nEx.P-9 of victim Babulal. According to him Babulal had\nsustained two injuries; one was lacerated wound on left\nparietal region and he had a complaint of pain on the joint\nof right buttock, however, no injury was found and hence it\nwas for the prosecution to prove the author of the injury\n                           35           Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                       Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                       Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\ncaused on the left side of the head of Babulal. If evidence\nof complainant Bhupendra Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-1) and\nother eyewitnesses is considered then accused Dalup @\nDilip Singh had caused injury on the head of victim Babulal\nwith the help of a stick. On the basis of the aforesaid\ndiscussion and logic as state above, appellant Dalup @\nDilip Singh is liable for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 323</a> of IPC\nfor the victim Babulal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_39\">(39) As discussed above no right of private defence is\navailable to any of the appellants. They were the assailants\nwho entered into the scene of crime with various weapons\nand therefore their intention can be presumed that they\ndid not assault anyone due to sudden or grave provocation.\nIf complainant Bhupendra Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-1) had\nrefused to go with accused Ram Singh to purchase a DP\n(transformer) then such denial could not result in such\ngrave or sudden provocation caused to either Ram Singh\nor any of the aforesaid appellants so that many injuries to\nvarious victims could have been caused and therefore they\nshould be held liable for various offences under <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_79\">Sections\n324</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_80\">323</a> of IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_40\">(40) When any accused enters the scene of crime having\ngun or any other weapon then it shall be presumed that he\nknows the result of assault if it is done by that particular\nweapon and since thereafter he assaulted various victims\nwithout any sudden or gave provocation or right of private\ndefence then as per the provisions contained under <a href=\"/doc/1284765/\" id=\"a_81\">Section\n39</a> of IPC his act of assault and causing injury shall be held\nto be done voluntarily. Hence, as discussed above,\nappellants Hukum Singh, Lallu @ Surendra Singh, Vishnu\nRaghuvanshi with Bhure Singh are responsible for offence\n                        36             Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nunder Section 324 of IPC for voluntarily causing simple\ninjuries to the victims Raghuveer Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">2), Vijay @ Mannu (PW-11) and Uttam Singh (PW-8) by\nfiring with the guns. As discussed above, Hariom caused\ngunshot injury to Shivram Singh (PW-4) and due to his\nvoluntary act he shall be liable for conviction of offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 324</a> of IPC, however, trial court convicted\nhim only of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 323</a> of IPC relating to\nthe injuries caused to Shivram Singh and therefore in the\nabsence of counter appeal filed by the State now no\naccused can be convicted of offence under <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 324</a> of\nIPC relating to victim Shivram Singh (PW-4) and hence it\nwould be appropriate to convict the appellant Hariom for\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 323</a> of IPC. Similarly, appellants\nSetu @ Satendra Singh and Neta @ Narendra who\nvoluntarily caused simple injuries to the victim Manna\n(PW-3) and both of them are liable for conviction of offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 323</a> of IPC. Dalup @ Dilip Singh had\nvoluntarily caused simple injuries to Shivram Singh (PW-4)\nand Babulal and therefore they are liable for conviction of\ntwo count charges of <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 323</a> of IPC. Similarly, Ram\nSingh had voluntarily caused hurt to the victims Ratan\nSingh and Ravindra Singh and therefore, he is also liable\nfor conviction of two count charges of <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 323</a> of IPC.\n(41) Now, at this stage, it shall be considered as to\nwhether any unlawful assembly was constituted and what\nwas the object of the unlawful assembly. Whether any\nappellant can be convicted for the offence done by the\nother with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/968081/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 34</a> or 149 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_90\">IPC</a>. As discussed\nabove, it is true that the appellants Suresh Singh and\nRajesh Singh fired with the guns causing death of the\n                            37               Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                            Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                                            Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\ndeceased Govind Singh. Accused Hukum Singh, Lallu @\nSurendra Singh, Vishnu Raghuvanshi, Bhure Singh and\nHariom     have   caused     simple   injuries    to   the    victims\nRaghuveer Singh Raghuvanshi (PW-2), Vijay Singh @\nMannu (PW-11), Uttam Singh (PW-8) and Shivram Singh\n(PW-4) with the help of firearms etc. Appellants Dalup @\nDilip Singh, Radheshyam, Setu @ Satendra Singh, Neta @\nNarendra and Ram Singh have voluntarily caused hurt to\nthe various victims like Shivram Singh (PW-4), Parmal\nSingh (PW-13), Manna, Babulal, Ratan Singh and Ravindra\nSingh and therefore at that time these many persons had\ncaused various injuries to various victims. Hence when\nmore   than   five   persons      have     used    criminal     force\nsimultaneously at the same time in the incident then the\nunlawful assembly is constituted. It was to be established\nby the prosecution to show about the common object of the\nunlawful    assembly.   If      evidence   of     eyewitnesses      is\nconsidered then initially the appellants had gathered to\nteach a lesson to the victim Bhupendra Singh Raghuvanshi\n(PW-1) and his companions by firing with the guns. If\nsomeone had already carried a gun in the unlawful\nassembly then it was in the knowledge of various accused\npersons that grave injury could be caused by firing of the\nguns to various victims. It was not necessary to be known\nby each of the appellants that someone would be killed in\nthe incident because it was not pre-planned. If other\nappellants except appellants Suresh Singh and Rajesh\nSingh were interested to kill the deceased Govind Singh\nthen they would have assaulted the deceased Govind Singh\nby firing or by any other weapon. According to the\nprosecution&#x27;s case, only appellants Rajesh Singh and\n                         38              Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                                        Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                                        Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nSuresh   Singh   participated   in   committing     murder      of\ndeceased Govind Singh.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_42\">(42) It was stated by various witnesses that appellants\nOnkar Singh and Anant Singh had exhorted appellant\nSuresh Singh to kill the deceased Govind Singh, however,\nthere is a contradiction between the evidence of various\nwitnesses. Complainant - Bhupendra Singh Raghuvanshi\n(PW-1)   has stated that Anant Singh and Onkar Singh\nexhorted the appellant Suresh Singh to kill Govind Singh\nwhereas some of the eyewitnesses have stated against\nOnkar Singh and some of them have stated against Anant\nSingh that he exhorted the appellant Suresh Singh to kill\nthe deceased Govind Singh, however, in this connection if\nFIR Ex.P-2 is perused then it was mentioned in the FIR\nEx.P-2 that Onkar Singh and Anant Singh suggested\nSuresh Singh to fire with a gun to kill Govind Singh and\nthereafter he fired. Again, there is no allegation on Anant\nSingh and Onkar Singh that they exhorted the accused\nRajesh Singh to kill the deceased. All the eyewitnesses\nhave stated that Onkar Singh and Anant Singh had no\nweapon in their hands and therefore it was mentioned in\nthe FIR Ex.P-2 and stated by the witnesses that, in the last,\nappellants Onkar Singh and Anant Singh pelted stones\nupon various victims, however, none of the victims has\nsustained any injury caused by pelting of stones. Hence,\nthe version of the witnesses cannot be accepted that\nappellants Onkar Singh and Anant Singh pelted stones.\nWhen there was no previous enmity between the parties\nand it was not established against Anant Singh and Onkar\nSingh that they had any specific enmity with the deceased\nGovind Singh then it was not possible that instead of\n                        39             Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nassaulting the complainant Bhupendra Singh Raghuvanshi\n(PW-1) they would have instigated the appellant Suresh\nSingh to kill the deceased Govind Singh.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">(43) It appears that since there was no weapon in the\nhands of Onkar Singh and Anant Singh, eyewitnesses have\ntried to implicate them with the allegation that they\nexhorted the appellant Suresh Singh to fire upon the\ndeceased Govind Singh. When the appellants Anant Singh\nand Onkar Singh did not have any enmity with the\ndeceased Govind Singh then there was no reason to exhort\nthe appellant Suresh Singh to kill the deceased Govind\nSingh and hence the allegation of exhortation made by the\nwitnesses against Onkar Singh and Anant Singh cannot be\naccepted. No overt act of Onkar Singh and Anant Singh is\nproved to show that they had any common intention with\nany other accused to commit any crime, hence, they had\nno common object of unlawful assembly and therefore they\nare not liable for the offence done by other accused with\nthe help of <a href=\"/doc/968081/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 34</a> or 149 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_92\">IPC</a>. Similarly, since they\ndid not participate in the crime, by mere presence, they\ncannot be held liable for the offence punishable under\nSections 147 or 148 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_93\">IPC</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">(44) When there was no object of unlawful assembly to\ncause death of the deceased Govind Singh and suddenly\nSuresh Singh and Rajesh Singh fired on the vital part of\nbody of Govind Singh and killed him, therefore it cannot be\nsaid that there was common intention or object of all the\nappellants who participated in the crime to kill the\ndeceased Govind Singh and therefore it cannot be said that\nthere was a common object of the unlawful assembly to kill\nthe deceased Govind Singh. Hence, common object of the\n                        40             Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nunlawful assembly could be to cause harm to the opposite\nparty by firing and that common object may be considered\nup to the offence under Section 326 or 324 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_94\">IPC</a>.\nHowever, it is not settled between the accused persons as\nto who was their target and why. It is not proved beyond\ndoubt against several appellants that they assaulted\nanyone or participated in the crime and therefore it cannot\nbe presumed that they were the part of the unlawful\nassembly or they would be liable for the offence done by\nthe other accused persons. Under these circumstances, the\npersons who have participated in the crime of assault with\nany weapon are liable for constitution of unlawful assembly\nto cause hurt to various victims and hence each of them\nshall be liable for the offence under Sections 147 or 148 of\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_95\">IPC</a> according to the weapon held by him. But the\nappellants whose overt act is not proved that they\nparticipated in assaulting anyone cannot be held to be the\npart of unlawful assembly and those cannot be convicted\nfor any offence done by any of the other appellants either\nwith the help of Section 149 or 34 or <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_96\">IPC</a> and by mere\npresence they will not be held liable for offence under\nSections 147 or 148 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_97\">IPC</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">(45) As discussed above, it is established that overt act of\nChandu @ Chandrabhan, Banti @ Hindu Singh, Onkar\nSingh and Anant Singh could not be proved beyond doubt\nthat they were the members of unlawful assembly or in\nfurtherance of the common object of unlawful assembly or\notherwise they used any criminal force upon any of the\nvictims and therefore they will be entitled to get the\nbenefit of doubt, hence, these four persons cannot be\nconvicted of any offence either directly or with the help of\n                        41             Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 149</a> of IPC. Since it was not proved that they were\nthe members of unlawful assembly, they cannot be even\nconvicted of offence under Section 147 or 148 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_99\">IPC</a> also.\n(46) As discussed above, it is established that Dalup @\nDilip Singh and Ram Singh had one stick each in their\nhands and since stick is not a deadly weapon, therefore,\nthough being a member of unlawful assembly and in\nfurtherance of his common object they used criminal force\nupon various victims still then these two appellants are\nliable for conviction of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 147</a> of IPC\nbecause they did not have any deadly weapon with them,\nwhereas remaining 10 accused persons, namely, Hariom,\nVishnu Raghuvanshi, Lallu @ Surendra Singh, Rajesh\nSingh, Radheshyam, Neta @ Narendra, Setu @ Satendra\nSingh, Bhure Singh, Hakim Singh and Suresh Singh had\nparticipated as members of unlawful assembly with deadly\nweapons like Farsas, guns or ballams and therefore as\ndiscuss above for their overt act they are liable for\nconviction of offence under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 148</a> of IPC.\n(47) Except of Suresh Singh and Rajesh Singh, remaining\nappellants are not liable for conviction of offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 302</a> of IPC either directly or with the help of\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 149</a> of IPC and therefore they would get the\nadvantage of acquittal for that offence. But it is proved\nbeyond doubt that they formed an unlawful assembly with\nthe object to voluntarily cause grievous or simple injuries\nto the various victims with guns, farsas and ballams and\ntherefore they shall be liable for each offence which is\ncommitted by any of the members of the unlawful\nassembly, hence, all of the appellants who are not entitled\nto be acquitted are liable to be convicted of three count\n                         42                  Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                            Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                            Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\ncharges of offence under Section 324 read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_104\">Section\n149</a>   of   IPC   relating    to   victims     Raghuveer        Singh\nRaghuvanshi (PW-2), Vijay @ Mannu (PW-11) and Uttam\nSingh (PW-8). Similarly, all of such appellants are liable for\nconviction of six count charges of offence under Section\n323 read with Section 149 of IPC relating to the victims\nShivram Singh (PW-4), Parmal Singh (PW-13), Manna (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">3), Babulal, Ravindra Singh and Ratan Singh. However,\naccording to para 123 of the judgment passed by the trial\ncourt the appellants have been sentenced for two count\ncharges of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 323</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_106\">149</a> of IPC and one\nconviction of offence under <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_108\">149</a> of IPC is now\nreduced to <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 323</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_110\">149</a> of IPC, hence, in the absence\nof any appeal filed by the State the appellants cannot be\nconvicted for six count charges of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_111\">Section\n323</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_112\">149</a> of IPC. Thus, the appellants shall be convicted of\nthree count charges of <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 323</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_114\">149</a> of IPC.\n(48) The trial court has convicted all the appellants of\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 506</a> of IPC that they threatened the\nvictims after the incident that they would kill them in\nfuture. When the entire criminal force was used by the\nappellants and one Govind Singh was killed then nothing\nremained with the appellants to do in future. Such\nwordings can not be considered as threatening or criminal\nintimidation if much harm was caused to the victims,\nhence, such words uttered by the accused persons shall\nnot constitute the offence of criminal intimidation but such\nwords may be considered to be used simply by the\nappellants to satisfy their ego. Hence, the trial court has\ncommitted an error in convicting the appellants of offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 506</a> of IPC and therefore it would be\n                        43             Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                                      Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nappropriate to acquit all the appellants from that charge.\n(49) So far as sentence is concerned, for offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 302</a> of IPC, the trial court has recorded a minimum\nsentence whereas after considering the fact that the\nappellants fired with the guns upon the various victims,\nthe trial court recorded the sentence of six months of RI\nwith a fine of Rs.100/- for offence under Section 324 read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 149</a> of IPC. If the trial court found crime of\n<a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 324</a> of IPC done by the accused with any sharp\ncutting weapon and at present it is found that three\nvictims have sustained simple injuries by firing then such\noffence is grave, however, it is not so grave that the\nappellants may be sentenced for more than a year for\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 324</a> of IPC. Similarly, only a fine of\nRs.1,000/- was imposed for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 323</a> of\nIPC for each count. Similarly for offence under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 148</a>\nof IPC the trial court recorded the sentence of six months&#x27;\nRI with a fine of Rs.100/- and for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 147</a>\nof IPC three months&#x27; RI with a fine of Rs.100/- was\nimposed. Hence, no further dilution is required in the\norder of sentence whereas each of the appellants has\nremained in custody for more than 400 days during trial\nand thereafter they remained in custody again for a few\ndays during appeal. Since the trial court has also ordered\nall the sentences to run concurrently and all of the accused\npersons have already undergone the sentence which could\nbe imposed for three count charges of Section 324 read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_124\">Section 149</a> of IPC and three count charges of Section\n323 read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 149</a> of IPC or under Section 147 or\n148 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_126\">IPC</a>. Hence, it would be appropriate to reduce the\nsentence for aforesaid offences to the period for which the\n                        44            Criminal Appeal No.172/2007\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                     Criminal Appeal No.176/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                     Criminal Appeal No.177/2007</span>\n\nappellants remained in custody.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">(50) On the basis of the aforesaid discussion, appeal filed\nby the appellants Onkar Singh, Anant Singh, Chandu @\nChandrabhan, Banti @ Hindu Singh is hereby allowed.\nTheir conviction and sentence for all the offences are\nhereby set aside.
