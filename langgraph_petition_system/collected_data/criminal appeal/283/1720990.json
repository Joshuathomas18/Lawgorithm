Ultimately,  on\nNovember  9, 1964, the Deputy Commissioner passed an  order,\ndirecting  the\tsaid  Mehboob  Khan  Usman  Khan  to  remove\nhimself, with two days of the service of the order,  outside\nthe district of Ahmedabad City and the contiguous  Districts\nof  Ahmedabad  Rural,  Kaira  and  Mehsana.   The  order  of\nexternment  contains  recitals that, after  considering\t the\nevidence &#x27;before him, and the explanation, furnished by\t the\nrespondent,  the Deputy Commissioner of Police is  satisfied\nthat the respondent is a desperate and dangerous man, and is\nengaged\t in  the  commission  of  acts\tinvolving  force  or\nviolence,  and acts punishable under Chapters XVI and  XVII,\nof  the\t <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_20\">Indian Penal Code</a>, within the localities  known  as\nRantiawadi,  Halimkhadki  and round about  areas,  and\tthat\nthere  are  reliable  materials to  prove  the\tallegations,\ncontained in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3), of the said order.\nThose allegations, it may be stated, are identical with\t the\nthree offences, referred to, in the notice, dated August 13,\n1964.\tThe Deputy Commissioner further states that, in\t his\nopinion the witnesses to the above incidents are not willing\nto  come forward to give evidence in public against  him  by\nreason\tof apprehension on their part as regards the  safety\nof their person and Pr\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">750</span>\nFinally, the order concludes by reciting that in exercise of\nthe  powers,.vested in the Deputy Commissioner, under<a href=\"/doc/26892158/\" id=\"a_21\"> S.  56</a>\nof  the\t Act, he directs the respondent to  remove  himself-\noutside\t the District of Ahmedabad City and  the  contiguous\nDistricts of Ahmedabad Rural, Kaira and Mehsana, within\t two\ndays from the date of service of the order.  The order\talso\nconcludes,  by-saying that the respondent should not  return\nto or reenter the places mentioned therein, for a period  of\ntwo years from the date of the order, without obtaining\t the\npermission, in writing, of the competent authority.\nThe  respondent\t in  Criminal Appeal  167/65  filed  Special\nCriminal  Application  No. 3 of 1965, in  the  Gujarat\tHigh\nCourt,\tunder  Arts. 226 and 227, of the  Constitution,\t for\nquashing this order of externment, passed against him.\t The\nmain  ground, on which the order was challenged, appears  to\nbe  that  the notice, dated August 13, 1964,  on  which\t the\nsubsequent  order of externment is based, was too vague\t and\ngeneral,  both\twith regard to the time and  places  of\t his\nalleged activities, and that the allegations made,  therein,\nwere  so general that he could not offer,  effectively,\t any\nexplanation, or substantiate his defence.  In short, it\t was\nthe grievance of the respondent that, in the notice,  issued\nunder<a href=\"/doc/178047173/\" id=\"a_22\"> S. 50</a>, the material allegations, had not been set out,\nand therefore, there had been no proper compliance with\t the\nprovisions  of\tthat  section, so as to\t enable\t the  Deputy\nCommissioner,  to take action, under<a href=\"/doc/26892158/\" id=\"a_23\"> S. 56</a> of the Act.\t The\nrespondent raised certain other objections, to the  validity\nand  legality of the order, one of which was that the  order\nof  externment,\t had  not  been\t passed,  by  the  competent\nofficer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">In the counter-affidavits, filed before the High Court,\t the\nDeputy Commissioner has stated that though the notice, under<a href=\"/doc/169724781/\" id=\"a_24\">\ns.  59</a>,\t was served on August 20, 1964, fixing the  date  of\nhearing as August 21, 1964, the respondent herein,  appeared\nbefore\tthe  officer,  on  that date  and,  after  making  a\npreliminary statement, at his request, the proceedings\twere\nadjourned  to  August 29, 1964, for submitting\this  written\nexplanation  and  also a list of witnesses, proposed  to  be\nexamined  by him.  On the said date also, at the request  of\nthe  respondent,  further adjournment was  granted  and,  on\nSeptember  14,\t1964, the respondent submitted\this  written\nstatement,  traversing\tthe averments made, in\tthe  notice,\ndated  August 13, 1964.\t He further examined  witnesses,  in\nhis   defence.\t  Therefore,   according   to\tthe   Deputy\nCommissioner,  the respondent had reasonable opportunity  of\ntendering his explanation, regarding the matters,  mentioned\nin  the\t notice.  It is further stated that  the  witnesses,\nexamined  by  the respondent, claimed no  knowledge  of\t the\ncriminal  activities, mentioned in the notice, and that\t the\nentire material, consisting of the evidence of the  victims,\nwho had suffered at the hands of the respondent, which\twere\nbefore the officer, was considered, and the officer was also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">751</span>\nsatisfied  that\t the respondent was indulging  in  offences,\npunishable under Chapters XVI and XVII, of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_25\">Indian  Penal\nCode</a>.  The officer was further satisfied that those  persons\nwere not willing to depose against him, in public, by reason\nof  apprehension, on their part, as regards the\t safety\t of,\ntheir  person  and property.  The  Deputy  Commissioner\t has\nfurther\t stated\t that,\tfrom  the  record   and\t information\navailable  with him, the respondent was a  wellknown  bully,\nterrorizing law-abiding citizens, in the areas, mentioned in\nthe notice, and that it was, after following the  procedure,\nindicated  in  s. 59, that an order was\t ultimately  passed,\nunder  s.  56.\tIt is further averred  that  the  notice  is\nexplicit  and  contains the general nature of  the  material\nallegations,  against the respondent, as is required, by  s.\n59  of\tthe  Act.  The, respondent, herein,  it\t is  further\nstated, has fully understood the nature of the\tallegations,\nmade  against  him,  as\t is clear from\tthe  nature  of\t the\ndefence, taken by him, and the evidence, adduced to  support\nthat  plea.   On  these and other  averments  made,  in\t the\ncounter-affidavit,  the Deputy Commissioner  submitted\tthat\nthe  order did not suffer from any infirmity, as alleged  by\nthe respondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">The  learned Judges of the Gujarat High Court, in the  order\nunder attack, have accepted the position that, under<a href=\"/doc/169724781/\" id=\"a_26\"> s.\t 59</a>,\nthe competent officer should inform the person, in  writing,\nof  the general nature of the material\tallegations  against\nhim.   It  is  their view that the nature  of  the  material\nallegations  should not be so general, as to make it  vague,\nand not precise, and that it must be of such a character  as\nto  give the person, concerned, a reasonable opportunity  of\ntendering    an\t  explanation,\t regarding   the    material\nallegations.   Having held that this is the principle to  be\napplied,  the learned Judges held that ground No. 3, of\t the\nnotice dated August 13, 1964, served on the-respondent,\t was\nopen  to the objection of &#x27;vagueness&#x27;.\tIn this\t connection,\nthe   learned  Judges  .refer  to  the\tdefinition  of\t the\nexpression  &#x27;place of public entertainment, as contained  in<a href=\"/doc/75295323/\" id=\"a_27\">\ns.  2(10)</a>,  of the Act.\t They further hold  that  to  allege\nagainst\t any individual that he consumed,  without  payment,\neatables,  i.e., articles of food, from a place\t of  public,\nentertainment&#x27;,\t which\twill  take in  the  various  places,\nmentioned  in  s.  2(10),  of  the  Act,  would\t not  afford\nsufficient  opportunity\t to  the  respondent,  as  to\twhat\nparticular   places   of  public  entertainment,   or\twhat\nparticular establishment Ike is supposed to have visited and\nconsumed eatables, without payment, and had ,beaten persons,\nwhen  legal  dues  were\t demanded.

In this view, the learned  Judges,\nultimately,  held  that\t ground No. 3 of  the  notice  dated\nAugust 13, 1964, was vague, as it could not have afforded  a\nreasonable oppertunity to the respondent herein, of offering\nhis  explanation,  or-\tleading evidence,  in  his  defence.\nInasmuch as this ground also, had taken into account, by the\nDeputy\tCommissioner, for passing the order  of\t externment,\nand as this ground was held to be vague, the learned  Judges\nultimately  quashed  the notice, issued under<a href=\"/doc/169724781/\" id=\"a_29\"> s.  59</a>,  dated\nAugust\t13, 1964, as well as the order of externment,  dated\nNovember  9,  1964,  passed against  the  respondent.\tThis\norder, is the subject of attack, by the State of Gujarat, in\nCriminal Appeal No. 167 of 1965.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">Similarly, a notice, dated-July 28, 1964, under<a href=\"/doc/169724781/\" id=\"a_30\"> s. 59</a> of the\nAct,  was  served  on Ahmed  Noor  Mohammad,  respondent  in\nCriminal Appeal No. 168 of 1965, by the Deputy Commissioner,\nAhmedabad  City, stating that the said officer\tproposed  to\nextern\tthe respondent, for a period of two years, under  s.\n56  of\tthe  Act.  In the  allegations,\t contained  in\tthis\nnotice, it was mentioned that the respondent was a desperate\nman, indulging in acts of violence and force, and that since\nSeptember 1963, till the date of the notice, he was  engaged\nin  the commission of the three acts, mentioned therein,  in\nthe  localities, known as Kazi-na-dhaba,  Maruwas,  Jamalpur\nand round about those places.  It is enough only to refer to\nthe  first  allegation, contained in this notice,  which  is\nsubstantially similar to the third allegation, mentioned  in\nthe notice, issued against Mahboob Khan Usman Khan; and that\nallegation  was\t to the effect that the\t respondent  visited\nplaces\tof public entertainment and refused to pay  for\t the\narticles,  consumed by him, under threats of Violence.\t The\nnotice\tfurther-stated that the witnesses to  the  incident,\nmentioned  therein,  were not willing to, come\tforward\t and\ndepose\tagainst\t the  respondent in  public,  by  reason  of\napprehension, on their part, as regards the safety of  their\nperson and property.  It was hence stated in the notice that\nit  was proposed to extern the respondent, from\t the  areas,\nmentioned  therein, for a period of two years.\t The  notice\nalso  intimated that 11 a.m., on August 6, 1964,  was  fixed\nfor receiving the explanation of the respondent, as well  as\nfor  hearing  him  and any of the witnesses  that  he  might\nproduce,  with\treference to the allegations,  made  in\t the\nnotice.\t  It  is seen from the records that  the  respondent\nappeared  before the officer dnd filed\twritten\t statements,\nexamined  witnesses  in support of his defence and  that  an\nadvocate appeared for him.  On February 9, 1965, the  Deputy\nCommissioner  passed  an  order, under<a href=\"/doc/26892158/\" id=\"a_31\"> s.  56</a>  of  the\tAct,\ndirecting  the respondent to remove himself from the  areas,\nmentioned in the order, for a period of two years and not to\nenter the same, without permission in writing, obtained from\na corn-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">753</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">petent\t authority.    In  this\t order\t also\tthe   Deputy\nCommissioner  has  stated that, on the\tmaterials  available\nbefore\thim and, after considering the explanation and\tthe.\nevidence, produced by the respondent, he was satisfied\tthat\nthe respondent was a desperate and dangerous person and\t was\nengaged\t in the commission of acts, involving  violence\t and\nacts, punishable under Chapters XVI and XVII, of the  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_32\">Indian\nPenal Code</a>, in the areas, mentioned in the notice, and\tthat\nthe three allegations, mentioned therein, were\testablished,\nand,  in view of the fact that the witnesses, regarding\t the\nabove  incidents, were not willing to come forward  to\tgive\nevidence, the order of externment was passed.\nThe  respondent challenged this order of externment,  passed\nagainst\t him,  as well as the notice, issued  under  s.\t 59,\nbefore\t the  Gujarat  High  Court,  in\t  Special   Criminal\nApplication  No. 8 of 1965, under Arts. 226 and 227, of\t the\nConstitution.\t Here  again,  the  stand,  taken   by\t the\nrespondent,  was  that\tthe allegations,  contained  in\t the\nnotice\tissued under<a href=\"/doc/169724781/\" id=\"a_33\"> s. 59</a>, were very vague  and  indefinite\nand inconclusive and, as such, it could not be said that  he\nwas   given   a\t reasonable  opportunity,   to\t offer\t his\nexplanation,   as  contemplated\t under\tthe  said   section.\nCertain\t other\tobjections, regarding the  legality  of\t the\norder, were also raised.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">In the counter-affidavit, filed by the Deputy  Commissioner,\nit  is\tstated that the order, dated February 2,  1965,\t was\npassed\tby  him,  under<a href=\"/doc/26892158/\" id=\"a_34\"> s. 56</a> of the Act,  after  a  careful\nconsideration, of all materials placed before him, including\nthe  written statement and the defence evidence, adduced  by\nthe  respondent.   It was further stated  that\tthe  notice,\nissued\tunder  s.  59, was in  strict  conformity  with\t the\nprovisions  of\tthat  section,\tand  the  respondent  had  a\nreasonable   opportunity   of  tendering   an\texplanation,\nregarding  the allegations, made against him.\tThe  learned\nJudges\tof  the Gujarat High Court, adopting  the  reasoning\ngiven  in Special Criminal Application No. 3 of\t 1965,\theld\nthat   the  notice,  under  s.\t59,  was  invalid  and,\t  in\nconsequence, the order of externment, also, must fall to the\nground.\t The learned Judges have held that allegation No. 1,\nin  the notice, dated July 28, 1964, is analogous to  ground\nNo.  3,\t in the connected application, and that\t ground\t had\nbeen  held to be vague.\t In consequence, the learned  Judges\nstruck down the order of externment, dated February 9, 1965,\nas  well as the notice, dated July 28, 1964.  This  order.is\nattacked, by the Deputy Commissioner, in Criminal,Appeal No.\n168 of 1965.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">Mr.  G.\t L.

But they  have  held  that\t the\nallegations,   regarding  the  two  respondents,   consuming\neatables,  from\t places\t of  public  entertainment,  without\npayment, and beating persons, when legal dues were demanded,\ncontained  in the two notices, are vague.  The reasoning  of\nthe  learned  Judges that the said allegations\tshould\thave\ncontained all the particular places of public entertainment,\nor  what  particular  establishment  the  respondents\twere\nsupposed   to  have  visited,  is  not\twarranted,  by\t the\nprovisions  of<a href=\"/doc/169724781/\" id=\"a_81\">\ts.  59</a>.\t In fact, if we\t may  say  so,\twith\nrespect, there is a slight inconsistency in the reasoning of\nthe  learned  Judges,  because, in the\tlater  part  of\t the\njudgment  they\tsay  that  a party is  not  entitled  to  be\nsupplied  with particulars of the allegations  made  against\nhim.   We  are therefore. not inclined to accept  the  above\nreasoning of the Gujarat High Court.  The notices,  referred\nto the periods during which the acts are stated to have been\ncommitted,  as well as the area where they are said to\thave\nbeen  committed.  No doubt, the expression &#x27;place of  public\nentertainment&#x27;,\t is defined in<a href=\"/doc/75295323/\" id=\"a_82\"> s. 2(10)</a> of the Act; but\t the\nmere fact that the said definition takes in various types of\nplaces,\t does not militate against the allegation No. 1,  in\nSpecial\t Criminal Application No. 3 of 1965,  or  allegation\nNo.  3,\t in the connected application, being  of  a  general\nnature\tof the material allegations, as contemplated,  under<a href=\"/doc/169724781/\" id=\"a_83\">\ns.  59</a>.\t  Without attempting to be exhaustive we  may  state\nthat  when  a person is stated to be a &#x27;thief&#x27;,\t that  alle-\ngation\tis  vague.  Again, when it is said that &#x27;A  stole  a\nwatch from X on a particular day and at a particular place&#x27;,\nthe allegation can be said to be particular.  Again, when it\nis stated that &#x27;X is seen at crowded bus stands and he picks\npockets&#x27; it is of a general nature of a material allegation.\nUnder  the  last illustration, given above,  will  come\t the\nallegations,  which,  according to the Gujarat\tHigh  Court,\nsuffer\tfrom  being too general, or vague.   Considering  it\nfrom the point of view of the party against whom an order of\nexternment  is proposed to be passed, it must be  emphasized\nthat when he has to tender an explanation to a notice, under<a href=\"/doc/169724781/\" id=\"a_84\">\ns.  59</a>, he can only give an explanation, which can be  of  a\ngeneral nature.\t It may be open to him to take a defence, of\nthe  action  being  taken,  due to  mala  fides,  malice  or\nmistaken identity, or he may be able to tender proof of\t his\ngeneral good conduct, or alibi, during the period covered by\nthe  notice  and  the like.  The  allegations  made  in\t the\nnotices,  issued  under\t s. 59, as  against  the  respective\nrespondents,  in our opinion, contain the general nature  of\nthe material allegations made against each of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">758</span>\nthem,  in respect of which the respondents had been given  a\nreasonable opportunity of tendering an explanation,  regard-\ning  them.   Therefore,\t it follows that  the  view  of\t the\nGujarat\t High Court that the notices, under<a href=\"/doc/169724781/\" id=\"a_85\"> s. 59</a>,  and\t the\norders\tof  externment, passed under<a href=\"/doc/26892158/\" id=\"a_86\"> s.\t 56</a>,  are  invalid,&#x27;\ncannot\tbe sustained.  The orders of the Gujarat High  Court\nare,  accordingly,  set aside, and these  criminal  appeals,\nallowed.  But, we may make it again clear, that in spite  of\nour decision, in favour of the appellants, no action can  be\ntaken  against\tthe respondents, in these  appeals,  on\t the\nbasis of the orders, which are now held to be valid.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">R.K.P.S.\t\t    Appeals allowed.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> 759</span>\n\n\n\n</pre>","numcites":17,"numcitedby":25,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":1720990,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"externment order","formInput":"externment%20order"},{"value":"bombay police act, 1951","formInput":"bombay%20police%20act%2C%201951"},{"value":"bombay police act","formInput":"bombay%20police%20act"},{"value":"reasonable opportunity ","formInput":"reasonable%20opportunity%20"},{"value":"threat","formInput":"threat"},{"value":"public place","formInput":"public%20place"},{"value":"Vague","formInput":"Vague"},{"value":"mehsana","formInput":"mehsana"},{"value":"external","formInput":"external"},{"value":"police act ","formInput":"police%20act%20"},{"value":"gujarat high court ","formInput":"gujarat%20high%20court%20"},{"value":"no further adjournment","formInput":"no%20further%20adjournment"},{"value":"adducing evidence","formInput":"adducing%20evidence"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
