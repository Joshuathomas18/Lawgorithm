The trial\n\n     Court held both the appellants guilty for commission of offence\n\n     punishable under <a href=\"/doc/329571/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 392</a> of IPC and awarded a sentence of RI\n\n     three years and fine amount of Rs.200/- each, in default of payment\n\n     of fine further RI for one month.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">  2.

Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant No.1 did not\n\n  contest the appeals on merit. He has contented that the appellant No.1\n\n  has already undergone actual jail sentence of near about seven years\n\n  from the date of his arrest and including remission he has completed\n\n  jail sentence of near about 10 years. It is further contended by the\n\n  learned counsel that if all these sentences, as awarded by the trail\n\n  Court, be run consecutively then last sentence would be over on\n\n  07.09.2029. Hence, the appellant No.1 shall remain in jail for a period\n\n  of 19 years. The learned counsel for the appellant No.1 placed\n\n  reliance on a judgment of the Apex Court passed in the matter of\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/133495790/\" id=\"a_8\">Benson vs State of Kerala</a>, (2016) 10 SCC 307 and contended that\n\n  this Court may order that the remaining jail sentence of the appellant\n\n  No.1 shall run concurrently and the appellant No. 1 be released from\n\n  jail.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">6.

In the present case, the appellant No.1 has already completed\n\n       actual jail sentence of near about seven years and including remission\n\n       he has completed more than nine years. All the cases are in regard to\n\n       same offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/329571/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 392</a> of IPC.

Now, the next question is in regard to deposition of fine\n\n  amount. The appellant No. 1 is a poor person. This fact is evident\n\n  from the fact that in one case the he has been granted suspension of\n\n  sentence, however, he could not deposit the fine amount and he is still\n\n  in jail. The appellant No. 1 has already completed the jail sentence in\n\n  default of payment of fine amount. Hence, it would not be proper that\n\n  the appellant No. 1 shall undergo the jail sentence in default of\n\n  payment of fine amount.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">12.
