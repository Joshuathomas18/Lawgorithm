On 18.10.2019 the accused persons were abusing the\n\n     deceased in filthy language and when the deceased objected to the same,\n\n     he was beaten by them.

Supporting the impugned judgment, it has been argued by the State\n\n   Counsel that;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">   •   all the eyewitnesses, out of which three are injured witnesses, are\n\n       natural witnesses and the question of planting them or fabricating the\n\n       case of prosecution does not arise. These witnesses have identified\n\n       the accused/appellants in the Court and stated on oath that they have\n\n       actively participated in the crime in question. Therefore, conviction of\n\n       accused/appellants with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 149</a> of IPC is in accordance\n\n       with law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">   •   TIP proceeding is merely a corroborative in nature and the purpose\n\n       behind TIP is to give direction to the investigation.        Thus, non-\n\n       conduction of TIP parade would not be fatal to the case of prosecution.\n\n   •   case of the appellants does not fall under any exception to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 300</a>\n\n       of IPC and therefore it cannot be converted for any lesser offence.\n\n   •   if accused No.12 has wrongly been arrayed as accused, he ought to\n\n       have objected the same at the initial stage, but he failed to do so and\n\n       now at the appellate stage he cannot be permitted to raise such\n\n       objection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">9. Bhagwati Bai (PW-1) is the lodger of FIR (Ex.P-1). He is also sister of the\n\n   deceased. She has deposed that she knew all the accused persons\n\n   present in the Court and also other accused persons who have not been\n\n   arrested yet. She has further deposed that on the date of occurrence she\n   along with her husband Gaurishankar had gone to village Dunda to meet\n\n  her brother Suresh (deceased). When they reached near the boring of\n\n  village, she found her brother Suresh lying there. She along with others\n\n  took her brother to his house. She has further stated that all of a sudden,\n\n  accused/appellant    Chhabiram,     Bhagwati,   Santram,    Anant,    Ramu,\n\n  Khilawan and his brother, whose name is not known to her, came there\n\n  and brought all of them near the canal. Accused Chhabi started shouting\n\n  &#x27;thief - thief&#x27; and thereafter all the accused persons attacked and assaulted\n\n  her, Suresh, Kumari Bai, Bindu &amp; Santosh. Accused Chhabiram caused\n\n  injury on the head of deceased by stone.        Santram &amp; Khilawan were\n\n  carrying knife and they caused injuries to deceased by the same. Accused\n\n  Anant, who was carrying club in his hand, also caused injury to the\n\n  deceased. Accused Khilawan caused injury on the head of Kumari Bai by\n\n  stone. Chhabiram assaulted her by belt. She has further stated that wives\n\n  of Chhabiram, Khilawan &amp; Bhagwati had snatched her earrings and\n\n  mangasutra. They have also snatched mobile and necklace of her sister\n\n  Kumari Bai. After tying a rope around the neck of Suresh they toed him to\n\n  the motorcycle and dragged him upto the pond. She somehow managed\n\n  to flee from there and straight-away went to the police station and lodged\n\n  the report. She has further stated that when accused Chhabiram was\n\n  about to cause injury to her sister Kumari Bai by stone, the same was\n\n  snatched by one police person namely Mahesh.             Thereafter all the\n\n  accused persons fled from there. She has further deposed that accused\n\n  Santram, Khilawan, Chhabi, Anant made Kumari Bai naked by removing\n\n  her clothes. Nothing could be elicited in the lengthy cross-examination of\n\n  this witness which makes her testimony unreliable or untrustworthy.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">10.Jagatram Yadav (PW-2) is the witness of seizure memo Ex.P-4.\n\n  Ravishankar (PW-3) is the witness of inquest Ex.P-3.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\"> 11.

He has further\n\n   stated that when they were taking the deceased with them to their house\n\n   situate at Tikrapara, Raipur on the way the accused persons attacked and\n\n   assaulted them.    He received injury on his face.      Accused persons\n\n   assaulted him by club &amp; belt. On being asked, this witness has pointed\n\n   towards accused Santram as the person who caused injuries to him by\n\n   belt &amp; club.   This witness further pointed towards accused Mahendra\n\n   Kumar as the one who had assaulted the deceased by stone.

On reaching there, they found the deceased lying beside the\n\n   road in unconscious condition. They brought back the deceased to home\n\n   where on regaining consciousness, he informed them names of accused\n\n   Chhabilal, Santram, Ramu &amp; others as the persons who assaulted him. He\n\n   has further deposed that when they were going to Raipur along with\n\n   deceased, on the way the accused persons attacked &amp; assaulted them.\n\n   This witness had identified accused Mahendra Singh, Khilawan, Bhagwati,\n\n   Lalaram, Chhabiram &amp; Tilak in the Court by touching them.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">14.

According to these witnesses, when they were\n\n  going to Raipur along with the deceased, the accused persons encircled\n\n  them and beat them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">        According to Kumari Bai (PW-10), the accused persons present in\n\n  the Court were the assailants, however, she denies the presence of lady\n\n  accused at the time of occurrence.

While pointing towards accused Chhabiram,\n\n  Dhanriam &amp; Bhagwati, she told that they assaulted the deceased with\n\n  club. She pointed out towards accused Chhabiram as the person who had\n\n  assaulted on her head by club. She has further stated that accused\n\n  persons have not only undressed her but also inserted hands in her\n\n  private part.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">        According to Bindu Sahu (PW-12), when they were going in auto-\n\n  rickshaw to Raipur, one lady shouted do not allow them to go else they\n\n  would lodge report in the police and hearing this, many persons came\n\n  there and started beating them. She has further stated that after tying a\n\n  rope around the neck of Suresh (deceased) they toed him to the\n\n  motorcycle.     She has admitted that she does not know names of the\n\n  assailants but recognized them by face. Thereafter she has identified\n\n  accused persons namely Bhagwati, Raju alias Manharan, Laxminarayan,\n\n  Tilak, Lala alias Ramcharan, Chhabiram, Khilawan &amp; Mahendra in the\n\n  Court, that is to say, points to him in the dock and states that they were\n\n  the assailants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">15.

As regards the complicity of accused/appellants in the crime in question,\n\n   the prosecution has examined Bhagwati (PW-1), Santosh Sahu (PW-8),\n\n   Gouri Shankar (PW-9), Kumari Bai (PW-10) &amp; Bindu Bai (PW-12) as\n\n   having witnessed the occurrence. Bhagwati (PW-1), Santosh Sahu\n\n   (PW-9), Kumari Bai (PW-10) are sisters &amp; brother, whereas Gouri Shankar\n\n   (PW-9) &amp; Bindu Bai (PW-12) are his brother-in-law &amp; sister-in-law.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_39\">         Bhagwati Bai (PW-1) was also injured during the occurrence and\n\n   according to him, on the occurrence day i.e. 19.10.2009 at about 5-6 in\n the evening when she along with her husband (PW-9) reached village\n\nDunda to meet her brother (deceased), they found her lying beside the\n\nroad in unconscious state. They took the deceased to his home. Accused\n\nChhabiram, Bhagwati, Santram, Anant,Ramu, Khilawan &amp; his brother\n\nwhose name is not known to her, entered the house and forcibly took\n\nthem towards the canal where accused Chhabi raised shout &quot;thief-thief&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">and thereafter all the accused persons beat them. Thereafter this witness\n\nstated as to the manner in which the incident took place and they were\n\nsubjected to assault by the accused persons. This witness sustained two\n\nabrasion injuries on her person as a result of attacks made by the\n\naccused on her at the time of occurrence. She has also identified the\n\naccused persons in the Court as the persons who caused injuries to the\n\ndeceased and injured persons.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      Testimony of Bhagwati (PW-1) to the extent of attack and assault by\n\naccused/appellants gets corroboration from the statements of Santosh\n\nSahu (PW-8) &amp; Kumari Bai (PW-10), other injured eyewitnesses of the\n\nincident, who have deposed in the Court as to the manner in which they\n\nwere assaulted by the appellants. According to these witness, while they\n\nwere going to Raipur in auto-rickshaw, the accused persons attacked and\n\nassaulted the deceased as a result of which he died. These witnesses\n\nhave also identified the accused persons in the Court as the persons who\n\ncaused injuries to the deceased and injured persons. Evidence of injured\n\neyewitnesses finds due support from other eyewitnesses i.e. Gouri\n\nShankar (PW-9), &amp; Bindu Bai (PW-12) and the medical evidence also.\n\nFurther, FSL report (Ex.P-41) shows that blood stains were found on the\n\narticles seized from accused Tilak &amp; Chhabiram and they failed to offer\n\nany explanation as to how the articles seized at their instance were found\n\nto be bloodstained.   This apart, no previous enmity has been alleged\n    between the accused persons and the eyewitnesses to give suspicion to\n\n   false implication of accused by them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">         It appears that there is some contradiction in the evidence of PW-1\n\n   and other eyewitnesses with respect to genesis of incident, but the main\n\n   substratum    of   testimony   of   PW-1,    that     is   to   say,   it   is   the\n\n   accused/appellants who attacked and assaulted her and the deceased,\n\n   has remained unshaken. It is now by well settled law that it may be in\n\n   given case, a particular statement of the witnesses or the testimony of the\n\n   witnesses may not be in conformity with the statement of other eye-\n\n   witnesses or that there is contradiction in the cross-examination to a\n\n   particular portion of the testimony but thereby it cannot be said that whole\n\n   testimony of the witness is to be discarded unless the Court finds that the\n\n   witness has no sanctity for the truth and is stating falsehood before the\n\n   Court. Thus, un-contradictory testimony of PW-1 to the extent of attacking\n\n   and   assaulting    the   deceased      &amp;   injured    eyewitnesses         by   the\n\n   accused/appellants can be relied upon and it would not be judicious to\n\n   reject her statement on that count. Even on ignoring the testimony of\n\n   Bhagwati Bai (PW-1), the testimonial assertions of other eyewitnesses i.e.\n\n   Santosh Sahu (PW-8), Gouri Shankar (PW-9), Kumari Bai (PW-10) &amp;\n\n   Bindu Bai (PW-12) proved to the hilt that the assailants of deceased\n\n   Suresh were the accused/appellants and none else.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">20. As regards the submission of learned counsel for accused/ appellants that\n\n   even though accused/appellants have been identified by the eyewitnesses\n\n   in the Court as the perpetrators of offence in question, the same cannot be\n\n   relied against them since no formal TIP was got conducted by the\n\n   investigating officer at the time of investigation. It is true that formal test\n\n   identification parade was not got conducted by the investigating officer\n\n   and had it been done by him, it would have further strengthened the\n   prosecution case, but its absence in the facts and circumstances of the\n\n  case cannot have the effect of proper identification of accused persons by\n\n  witnesses in the court. In the case in hand, Bhagwati Bai (PW-1), lodger\n\n  of FIR, had disclosed the names of assailants in the promptly lodged FIR\n\n  (Ex.P-1). Accused/appellants were also named in her statement recorded\n\n  by the police under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 161</a> CrPC.         In the Court, she identified the\n\n  accused involved in the incident by saying that &quot;the accused persons\n\n  present in Court today are the same persons who were assaulting\n\n  deceased Suresh and others&quot;. Other injured witnesses have also duly\n\n  identified their assailant who are none but amongst the persons named in\n\n  the FIR.    No anomaly has been pointed out by the defence in the\n\n  identification in Court.   It is settled legal preposition that identification of\n\n  the accused by witness in the court during the course of trial while his\n\n  deposition is being recorded is substantive piece of evidence whereas\n\n  holding of TIP during the course of investigation is mere corroborative\n\n  piece of evidence. The defence cannot be allowed to dislodge the\n\n  substance piece of evidence on a plea that the corroboration piece of\n\n  evidence which could have been arranged is not available. Thus, non-\n\n  conducting of TIP is not fatal to the prosecution case. Moreover, it is\n\n  further settled legal preposition that irregularity or omission on the part of\n\n  investigating officer during the course of investigation should not be\n\n  allowed to make a tool to dislodge the otherwise believe-worthy\n\n  prosecution story.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">21. So far as the submission of learned counsel for accused/appellant\n\n  Mahendra Sahu in Criminal Appeal No.194/2012 that his name is\n\n  &#x27;Mahendra Sahu&#x27; and not &quot;Mahesh Sahu&#x27; and he has been wrongly\n\n  prosecuted by the police by showing him as &#x27;Mahendra alias Mahesh\n\n  Sahu&#x27; is concerned, from perusal of the record, it is clear that when this\n    accused was heard at the time of framing of charge, no such objection or\n\n   protest was raised by him that he is &#x27;Mahendra Sahu&#x27; and not &#x27;Mahesh\n\n   alias Mahendra Sahu&#x27;. On the contrary, he appended his signature on the\n\n   order framing charge as &quot;Mahesh alias Mahendra&quot;.         Furthermore, any\n\n   application for discharge on the aforesaid ground has also not been filed\n\n   by this appellant before or at the time of framing charge. Most importantly,\n\n   this appellant was duly identified by the injured eyewitnesses i.e. PW-8,\n\n   PW-9, PW-10 in the Court and a specific overtact was attributed to this\n\n   appellant by them that he is the person who caused stone injury on the\n\n   head of deceased. In this situation, the discrepancy, as tried to be\n\n   projected by the defence, in the FIR is of no help to this appellant and\n\n   accordingly, the argument in this regard is rejected.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">22. As far as involvement of accused/appellant Hiroo Bai in Criminal Appeal\n\n   No.197/2012 is concerned, though the eyewitnesses to the incident have\n\n   attributed specific overtact to each of the appellants, but they did not\n\n   attribute any overtact against this appellant. Even one of the eyewitnesses\n\n   had denied presence of this appellant on the spot at the relevant point of\n\n   time. In absence of any overtact against this appellant, she is entitled for\n\n   the benefit of doubt since the death was caused due to the assaults made\n\n   by all the accused/appellants collectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">23. According to Kumari Bai (PW-10), all the accused persons were pressing\n\n   her breast. Accused/appellant Raju tore her saree and inserted his finger\n\n   in her private parts. This has been corroborated by Bhagwati Bai (PW-1) &amp;\n\n   Gaurishankar (PW-9). Thus, it is clear that there was intentional assault\n\n   or use of criminal force to Kumari Bai (PW-10) by the accused/appellants\n\n   to outrage her modesty. Being so, the offence under <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 354</a> of IPC is\n\n   proved against the accused/appellants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\"> 24. For the foregoing discussion, we are of the considered view, that the\n\n   prosecution    has   successfully   proved   the   complicity   of   all   the\n\n   accused/appellants, except accused/appellant Hiroo Bai, in the crime in\n\n   question.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">25. Accused/appellants have been sentenced for life under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 302</a> of\n\n   IPC with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 149</a> of IPC. <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 149</a> of IPC says that every\n\n   member of an unlawful assembly at the time of committing the offence is\n\n   guilty of that offence. This section creates a specific and distinct offence\n\n   by creating constructive or obligatory liability of the members of unlawful\n\n   assembly for the unlawful acts committed pursuant to the common object.\n\n   For proving common object the prosecution has to establish that the\n\n   accused persons were having common object as laid down under <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_36\">Section\n\n   141</a> of IPC. The prosecution must show that the illegal act was committed\n\n   by a member of assembly which had common object. In the case in hand,\n\n   the common object for which the accused/appellants have been convicted\n\n   is of murdering Suresh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">26. From the entire facts of the case, it appears that the common object of the\n\n   appellants was to catch and teach lesson to the thieves. No evidence has\n\n   come that they were having common object of murdering the deceased.\n\n   As per prosecution case, as many as 19 accused persons had attacked\n\n   the complainant party. Post-mortem report of the deceased reveals that\n\n   he received abrasions &amp; contusions caused by hard &amp; blunt object\n\n   although sufficient to cause his death in the ordinary course of nature.\n\n   Further, MLC reports of injured persons show the nature of injuries as\n\n   &#x27;simple&#x27;.   Had there been any common object to cause murder of the\n\n   deceased or any member of complainant side, there would have been\n\n   many injuries on deceased as well as other injured persons on the vital\n\n   parts of their body. Evidence on record further goes to show that there is\n    no evidence of motive or previous enmity between the complainant party\n\n   and the accused party. The available evidence would further show that it\n\n   was a case of sudden quarrel and as such ethere was no premeditation\n\n   on the part of the appellants. In these circumstances, in our opinion, the\n\n   charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_38\">149</a> of IPC against the accused/appellants is\n\n   not proved, however, looking to the nature of injuries sustained by the\n\n   deceased, which were sufficient to cause his death, and manner in which\n\n   the deceased was assaulted, it can be safely held that while inflicting\n\n   injuries on the deceased, the appellants had the intention of causing such\n\n   injuries as would result in his death but had no knowledge that such\n\n   injuries   were    likely   to   cause   his   death   and   being   so,   the\n\n   accused/appellants cannot escape their conviction under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 304</a>\n\n   Part I read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 149</a> of IPC.            In these circumstances, the\n\n   accused/appellants could, at the most, can be held guilty under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_41\">Section\n\n   304</a> Part-I/149 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_42\">IPC</a> and not under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_44\">149</a> of IPC as has been\n\n   done by the trial Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">27. From the facts and circumstances of the instant case, as discussed herein\n\n   above, commissioning of offence in question by the accused/appellants or\n\n   their participation in unlawful assembly using force or violence as a\n\n   member of unlawful assembly is proved beyond reasonable doubt. So,\n\n   we are of the opinion that the learned trial Judge was right in convicting\n\n   the appellants for commissioning of offence under Section 147 of I.P.C.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">28.
