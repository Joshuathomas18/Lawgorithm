We\n\nnote with some surprise and consternation that despite the\n\nsaid Order, as per the office report, while the suo moto\n\nproceedings have been so registered, they were not listed on\n\n16.11.2021 nor on any date thereafter.\n\n    We have a report of the High Court of Allahabad which\n\nseeks to suggest that the 18 matters remitted to the High\n\nCourt for consideration of bail were listed on 15.11.2021,\n\n16.11.2021 and 17.11.2021 and that appearances were not put\n\nin on behalf of the appellants despite the matters being\n\nlisted in the roster bench and none appeared to press the\n\nmatters for being taken up on board. The affidavit is dated\n\n15.11.2021 and learned counsel for the High Court seeks to\n\nfile an updated report as he states that some matters have\n\nbeen dealt with while in other matters though listed on\n\nnumerous occasions, none appeared for the accused.\n\n    We   have   also   emphasized   to    learned   counsel    for   the\n\nState that in reference to our observation on the last date\n\nabout    consideration   of   cases      under   the   Uttar   Pradesh\n\nPrisoners Release on Probation Rules, 1938, there should be\n\nbetter coordination between the States and the Registry of\n\nthe High Court.

It is not appropriate that those\n\ncases lie in the High Court with sentences much beyond 14\n\nyears    being   served     without        even    being     examined      on   the\n\nquestion of their release under the Policy.\n\n    We    thus      call   upon      the    High     Court    and    the    State\n\nGovernment to prepare a list of such of the cases where the\n\naccused have already served out 14 years of sentence and for\n\none reason or the other, the appeal has not been heard (even\n\nif it be fault of the lawyer) and those cases should be put\n\nbefore the Board. It is also possible that in some of these\n\ncases, once the accused is released, the person may not at\n\nall be interested in prosecuting the appeal.\n\n    There     may    be    cases     where    for     whatever       reason     the\n\nadvocate may not be present as has been set out in the\n\nreport of the High Court but if they have already completed\n\n14 years of actual sentence, the State itself should take an\n\nappropriate stand and the learned Judge can himself pass\n\nappropriate      orders    to   at    least       examine    those    cases     for\n\nrelease and the absence of the advocate cannot come in the\n\nway in such a scenario.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">    We have put to learned AAG and the learned counsel for\n\nthe High Court that a list should be prepared of all cases\n\nwhere the person has served out a sentence of 14 years, is\n\nnot a repeat offender, and in any case if in these cases at\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                                  3</span>\n\fone   go    bail     can    be     granted     and   cases    remitted     for\n\nexamination under the Uttar Pradesh Prisoners Release on\n\nProbation Rules, 1938.

Thereafter, the\n\nappeal was listed on four occasions for hearing but was not\n\ntaken up though the counsel was ready.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                              13</span>\n\f     In our view, there is apparently a misconception that\n\nif   the   Court    is   ready   to    hear    the    appeal,   the   bail\n\napplication should not be considered in all circumstances.\n\nThis would normally be true as counsels can’t get away with\n\nunpreparedness to argue the appeal and and claim bail. The\n\ncaveat to this would be in cases where a person has already\n\nserved out 14 years of actual sentence as in that case, a\n\ndifferent norm comes into place requiring the case to be\n\nconsidered    throughly     under     the     Uttar   Pradesh   Prisoners\n\nRelease on Probation Rules, 1938. Thus to deny even bail to\n\nsuch a person for the fault of the counsel who does not\n\nargue, the accused having nothing to gain, would be really a\n\nparity of justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">     We are thus of the view that this is a fit case to\n\ngrant bail to the accused on terms and conditions to the\n\nsatisfaction   of    the   trial      Court.
