He pointed out that the contention  that  the  judgments  of\nthis Court have held that the prosecution can rely on the confession  of  an\naccused made before a police officer in every  case  where  the  accused  is\ncharged of a TADA  offence,  as  long  as  the  trial  is  joint,  has  been\nmisconceived.  He also pointed out that if the language  of  the  provisions\nled to a situation that  a  confession  to  the  police  becomes  admissible\nirrespective of the  fate  of  the  TADA  charge,  then  it  would  lead  to\ninvidious  discrimination  between  the  accused,  who  were  charged   (but\nacquitted) under TADA along with other offences and those who  were  accused\nonly of non-TADA offences.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"402202\" id=\"span_4\">8)    Mr. Harish Salve further pointed out that in <a href=\"/doc/402202/\" id=\"a_67\">Prakash Kumar  @  Prakash\nBhutto vs. State of Gujarat</a> (2005) 2 SCC 409, it was  contended  before  the\nCourt that “rigours of <a href=\"/doc/1387296/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 12</a> are discriminatory and attract  the  wrath\nof <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_69\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_70\">21</a> of the Constitution  as  it  empowers  the  Designated\nCourt to try and convict the accused for the offences  committed  under  any\nother law along with the offences committed  under  TADA  thereby  depriving\nthe rights available  to  the  accused  under  the  ordinary  law.”     This\ncontention was rejected by holding that “<a href=\"/doc/1387296/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 12</a> is to take care  of  the\noffences connected with or incidental to terrorist  activities.   The  other\noffences being connected and inextricably  intertwined  with  the  terrorist\nact.”</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"818140\" id=\"span_5\">9)    He further pointed out that a Bench of five Judges of  this  Court  in\n<a href=\"/doc/818140/\" id=\"a_72\">Sanjay Dutt vs. State</a> (1994) 5 SCC 410, had observed in  paragraph  14  that\n“the construction made of any provision of this Act  must  therefore  be  to\npromote the object  of  its  enactment  to  enable  the  machinery  to  deal\neffectively  with  the  persons  involved  in,  and  the  associated   with,\nterrorist and disruptive activities while ensuring that any  person  not  in\nthat category  should  not  be  subject  to  the  rigors  of  the  stringent\nprovisions of the ….Act.  It must, therefore, be  borne  in  mind  that  any\nperson who is being  dealt  with  and  prosecuted  in  accordance  with  the\nprovisions of the TADA must ordinarily have the opportunity to show that  he\ndoes not belong to the category of persons governed by TADA.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"905055\" id=\"span_6\">Such a  course\nwould permit exclusion from its ambit of persons not intended to be  covered\nby it……”   In paragraph 17,  this  Court  cited  with  approval  an  earlier\ndecision, viz., <a href=\"/doc/905055/\" id=\"a_73\">Niranjan Singh Karam  Singh  Punjabi  vs.  Jitendra  Bhimraj\nBijayaI</a>, (1990) 4 SCC 76 in which it was observed that “when a law visits  a\nperson with serious penal consequences, extra care must be taken  to  ensure\nthat those whom the Legislature did not intend  to  become  by  the  express\nlanguage of the Statute are not roped in by stretching the language  of  the\nlaw.”  This Court read down the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1601096/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 5</a>  of  TADA  and  held\nthat the presumption under the said section in  relation  to  possession  of\nweapons was a rebuttable presumption and an accused could  always  establish\nhis innocence in relation to that statute.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">10)   According to him, only where the transactions in respect of  which  an\naccused is convicted are interrelated  inextricably  with  the  transactions\nwhich fall under TADA, then <a href=\"/doc/1387296/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 12</a> would enable the prosecution to  rely\nupon the confession of the accused made to a  police  officer.   He  further\npointed out that it would be a travesty  to  apply  this  principle  in  the\npresent case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">11)   By poining out  the  confession  of  the  appellant  (A-117),  learned\nsenior counsel contended that even if we believe  the  statements  made,  it\nwould simply establish a case of violation of the  <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_76\">Arms  Act</a>,  there  is  no\nsuggestion of  any  terrorist  act.   On  the  contrary,  the  act  was  the\nresultant of the personal as well as the security need of the family of  the\nappellant.  He further contended that judicial notice must be taken  of  the\nstate of affairs in Bombay during the post Babri Masjid  demolition  period,\nparticularly, in  January,  1993.   It  is  further  pointed  out  that  the\nLegislature did not intend to cover such persons ever in a law dealing  with\nterrorism.  The victims of terrorism of  a  kind  (vicious  communal  riots)\ncannot and should not be treated at par with perpetrators.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">12)   He further pointed out that the  unchallenged  finding  of  the  trial\nCourt in the present case is that  the  alleged  acquisition  of  2  illegal\nweapons by the appellant (A-117) was at a  different  point  of  time,  much\nbefore even the conspiracy in relation to the Bombay blasts  was  commenced.\nHe further contended that the provocation for the  alleged  acquisition  was\nnot the conspiracy or any act or omission related to the Bombay blasts,  but\nrelated to an entirely different event, i.e., the riots in January 1993  and\nthe appellant (A-117) allegedly, out of fear for his own life  and  for  the\nsecurity of his family, acquired those weapons.  Under  such  circumstances,\nthe question of any connection leave alone the  acquisition  of  weapons  or\nany act or omission relating to the Bombay  blasts  is  conspicuous  by  its\nabsence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_43\">13)   With regard to the evidence in order to establish that  the  appellant\nwas in conversation with Anees over phone, learned senior counsel  contended\nthat the alleged confession of Samir Hingora (A-53)  as  well  as  of  Hanif\nKandawala (A-40) (his partner) to the effect that the appellant (A-117)  was\nin conversation with Anees relates to A-53’s  visit  to  the  house  of  the\nappellant (A-117) on the night of 15th  January  whereas  the  call  records\nrelied on were of 16th January, 1993.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_44\">14)   Learned senior counsel also pointed out that the prosecution  has  not\nappealed the findings of the Designated Court  and  the  alleged  confession\nwhich suggested that the appellant (A-117) was in  conversation  with  Anees\nis, in fact, unbelievable. One significant reason for the same  is  that  it\ndoes not explain as to how Samir could have known that the appellant was  in\nconversation with someone on a  landline  telephone  which  was  inside  his\nhouse.  This attempt of the prosecution to  unnecessarily  create  prejudice\nagainst the appellant (A-117) is baseless  and,  therefore,  merits  summary\nrejection.  The judgment of this Court in Sanjay Dutt’s case  (supra)  dealt\nwith a pure interpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1601096/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 5</a> of TADA.  It clearly lays down  that\nthe possession of a weapon is not per se a TADA offence.  <a href=\"/doc/1601096/\" id=\"a_78\">Section  5</a>  mearly\nraises a presumption that a person, who is  in  possession  of  unauthorized\narms or ammunitions  of  the  specified  variety,  would  be  liable  to  be\npunished under TADA.  According to him, this Court, in fact, read  down  the\nplain language of <a href=\"/doc/1601096/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 5</a> to make it  applicable  only  as  a  presumptive\nrule of evidence.  This  issue  is  no  longer  open  because  it  has  been\nconclusively  found  that  the  alleged  acquisition  of  the   weapon   had\nabsolutely nothing to do with any of the  alleged  terrorist  activities  of\nthe other accused  in  the  conspiracy.   Learned  senior  counsel  for  the\nappellant further contended that the State has not filed an  appeal  in  the\nmatter, hence, stands concluded.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">15)   In addition to  the  above  arguments,  Mr.  Surendra  Singh,  learned\nsenior counsel for A-118 contended that everything was manufactured  at  the\nCrime Branch Police Station.  He further contended that even  if  A-118  was\nhaving possession of AK 56 rifle, memorandum for the same was not signed  by\nhim and <a href=\"/doc/1387296/\" id=\"a_80\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1972990/\" id=\"a_81\">15</a> of TADA have no  application  in  his  case.   He\nfurther submitted that his confession is hit by <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 25</a> of  the  Evidence\nAct, 1872 and his alleged  statement  is  compelled  one  which  is  hit  by\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">16)   Similar to the contentions of  Mr.  Salve  and  Mr.  Singh,  Mr.  B.H.\nMarlapalle, learned senior counsel for A-124 also contended that  there  was\nno constructive possession of any  weapon  and  A-124  was  not  having  any\nknowledge about it.  He also contended that he was charged  only  under  the\nArms act and <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_84\">IPC</a> which has nothing to do with TADA and the  offence  against\nhim, if any, ought to have been referred to the normal  criminal  court  and\nfor that reason, the confession recorded  under  TADA  ought  to  have  been\nerased.  He also very much relied on the decisions of this Court  in  Sanjay\nDutt (supra), Prakash Kumar (supra) and Mohd. Amin vs.  CBI  (2008)  15  SCC\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_47\">49.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">17)   Learned ASG met all the contentions and took us through  the  relevant\nmaterials relied on by the prosecution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">Confesssional Statement of Sanjay Dutt (A-117)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_50\">18)   The confessional statement of A-117 was duly  recorded  under  <a href=\"/doc/1972990/\" id=\"a_85\">Section\n15</a> of TADA on 26.04.1993 at 15.30 hrs.

After about 15-20 min., he took out three rifles and they\n      said it is AK-56 rifles.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">(xi)  I got some cloth from my house and gave it to  them.

I returned two AK-56 rifles\n      and a part of the ammunition to them but retained one AK-56 rifle  and\n      some ammunitions with me.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">(xviii)     Around Sept. 1992, during one of my  shooting  at  R.K.

They offered me a 9 mm pistol with ammunition.  When\n      I saw it, I liked it and had a strong desire  to  purchase  the  same.\n      They offered it to me for a sum  of  Rs.40,000/-.   I  paid  the  said\n      amount in cash to them at my house and purchased the same.  I  do  not\n      know the name of that person who was brought by Kayyum.

I contacted my friend Mr. Yusuf Nullwala  on\n      telephone and asked him that something is lying in  a  black  coloured\n      bag which is kept in my hall at the second floor of my  house  and  it\n      should be taken away immediately and  destroy  the  things  completely\n      which are there in the bag,  otherwise, I shall be in a great trouble.\n       By this time, the news  about  my  possession  of  AK-56  rifles  had\n      appeared in the press and on coming to  know  about  this,  my  father\n      asked me about the truthfulness of this news, but I denied  the  same.\n      My anxiety about the whole episode became unbearable and I decided  to\n      return to Bombay in between.  My father informed my flight details  to\n      the Police and I was picked up by police as soon as I landed at Bombay\n      and I confessed the whole things to them.”\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_66\">19)    The  abovesaid  confession  highlighted  the  crime  for  which   the\nappellant-Sanjay Dutt has been charged.

The following  extracts  from  the\nconfession of the appellant are pertinent:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">      “Somewhere around the year, 1970, I came in contact with one person by\n      name Azhar Hussain and later on I became very friendly  with  him.  He\n      was cousin of Sanjay Dutt through him I met Sanjay Dutt and  developed\n      friendship with him as he  was  also  fond  of  hunting,  fishing  and\n      staying in camp life.  After this myself and Sanjay Dutt  used  to  go\n      out for hunting with other friends occasionally.  I  came  in  contact\n      with  Sanjay  Dutt’s  father  and  other  family  members  due  to  my\n      friendship with Sanjay Dutt and his cousin Azhar  Hussain.   Later  on\n      Sanjay Dutt had started taking on drugs and because of this he used to\n      remain out off from us and started avoiding me.  However,  my  contact\n      with Sanjay’s father and other family members was as it  is  and  they\n      normally used to ask me to convince Sanjay to give up the drugs but my\n      convincing and persuasion did not help him.”\n\n\n      “Somewhere in the year 1984, Sanjay has taken me out  to  one  of  his\n      friend by name Tariq Ibrahim’s place in Kanpur.  From there his friend\n      had taken us out of his farm in Tarai and  we  stayed  there  for  one\n      week.  During the stay, I casually mentioned to Tariq Ibrahim  that  I\n      am quite fond of guns but I am not getting arms license.  Then he told\n      me that don’t worry my brother is Supdt. of Police at  Ratlam  and  he\n      will get you arms license  as  and  when  you  wanted.   Later  on,  I\n      contacted his brother Asif Ibrahim, who was Supdt. of  Police,  Ratlam\n      to give me arms license, he did it and subsequently  he  gave  me  two\n      more arms licenses.  After getting these licenses, I  was  gifted  two\n      guns by Sunil Dutt out of which one was 12 Bore DBBL gun  and  another\n      was 22 Rifle.  I purchased the 3rd weapon, which is single barrel  375\n      Magnum Rifle.”\n\n\n      “In the meanwhile,  I  had  come  in  contact  with  one  Kesi  Bapuji\n      Adajenia, who was also in steel fabrication business and was  also  an\n      old hunter so we  became  friends.   He  also  used  to  give  me  sub\n      contracts for steel fabrication.  I had introduced him to Sanjay  Dutt\n      also and later on he went with us for hunting to a  place  near  Surat\n      once.”\n\n\n      “Later on Sanjay Dutt became quite popular in Hindi movies and most of\n      the times he used to remain busy in his shootings.  Many times, I also\n      used to get to the place for shooting to meet  Sanjay  Dutt.   He  had\n      taken me to Bangalore, Mysore, Ooty, Kodai  Kanal  and  various  other\n      places during this outdoor shooting to these places.  Normally, I used\n      to meet Sanjay two to three times in a week either at his house or  at\n      the place of shootings.”\n\n\n      “In the first week of April, he left for Mauritius and I got busy with\n      my normal business.  Then one day, I read in newspaper the  news  item\n      that “Sanjay dutt is in possession of AK-56 Rifles.”\n\n\n      In the same day evening, I received a telephone call at my residential\n      telephone from Sanjay dutty, who was speaking from Mauritius.  He told\n      me that there is something which is kept in a black coloured bag  kept\n      in his room at his residence (i.e. 58, Pali  Hill  Bandra,  Bombay-50)\n      and I shall take that bag from his room and destroy the things  inside\n      it immediately otherwise he will be in a great trouble.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">      Next day morning, I went to Sanjay’s residence and took the black  bag\n      from his second floor room and opened it there only.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">      When I opened it I found it containing  one  AK-56  rifle,  two  empty\n      magazines and approximately two hundred fifty  rounds  of  AK-56,  one\n      pistol and one loaded magazines of pistol.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">      I took out the AK-56 rifle there only and cutted it in pieces  with  a\n      hexa, which I had taken along with me then I put all the cut pieces in\n      the bag and came to my friend Kersi Bapuji Adajenia’s house as he used\n      to keep all the tools of his steel fabrication in the  godown  in  his\n      house.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">      I told him the whole story and also that Sanju is in great trouble, so\n      I required your help in melting and destroying the cutted pieces of AK-\n      56 rifles.  Both of us came to his godown and  I  tried  to  melt  the\n      cutted pieces of AK-56 with the help of cutter, but could not succeed,\n      then my friend Adajenia melted all the pieces of AK-56 rifle with  the\n      help of gas cutter.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\">      After that I gave the pistol to Kersi Bapuji  Adajenia  asked  him  to\n      burn it also after sometime.

Bishnoi, the then DCP, Zone-III, Bombay.  The  following  extracts\nfrom the confession of the appellant-Kersi Bapuji Adajenia are relevant:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">      “I am Kersi Bapuji Adajenia, age 63  years.   I  stay  at  605,  Karim\n      Manzil, JSS Road, Bombay-2 with my family.  I normally take  contracts\n      for steel fabrications and the work  is  done  at  the  sites  of  the\n      parties only.  I normally keep the equipments and the tools for  steel\n      fabrications at the temporary godown in my  house  and  I  take  these\n      equipments to the sites as and when it is required.  Due to  the  work\n      load, I have purchased two or three sets of  all  the  equipments  and\n      tools.  Whenever there is a heavy work load, I give the excess work on\n      sub-contracts to other persons.  Sometimes, I provide my own tools and\n      equipments to sub-contractors.  Yusuf Mohsin Nullwala was my one  such\n      sub-contractor.  I had come in contact with him about ten years  back.\n      Since then, I used to give him sub-contracts regularly.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">      During the days of my youth, I used to be very  fond  of  hunting  and\n      used to go out for hunting occasionally with my friends.   But  I  had\n      given up  this  hobby  (hunting)  since  1969  onwards.   This,  Yusuf\n      Nullwalla was also very fond of hunting and he  used  to  talk  a  lot\n      about  hunting  and  about  his  friend  cineactor  Sanjay  Dutt.   He\n      introduced me with him about seven years back and they  had  taken  me\n      out once for hunting to a place near  Surat,  I  stayed  with  Sanjay,\n      Yusuf and three – four their other friends there for two days  and  we\n      all came back.  After that I met Sanjay Dutt for two  or  three  times\n      more.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">      Somewhere around the end of first week of April, 1993, one  day  Yusuf\n      Mohsin Nullwalla came to my house around 10.00 a.m. in the morning, he\n      was having a black coloured Rexin bag hung to his  shoulder  with  him\n      and he said to me that Sanjay Dutt had telephoned him saying  that  on\n      AK-56 rifle and other things are lying at this house  and  police  had\n      come to know about his and he is in great trouble and he has asked  me\n      to collect it and destroy it, so I had gone to his house and collected\n      it and I have also cut it into pieces and now I want gas  cutting  set\n      to completely destroy it, then he showed me the cut  pieces  of  AK-56\n      rifle by opening the bag.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">      Since I have read about Sanjay Dutt’s possession of  AK-56  rifle  and\n      police being after him in the newspaper about a day  or  two  earlier.\n      So initially, I told him that I do not went to get  involved  in  this\n      thing.  Then Yusuf said to me that in case he goes out to  some  other\n      place for destroying it he is likely to be caught and requested me  to\n      again to give my gas cutter, so I agreed.  Then he went to  my  godown\n      and started destroying the cut pieces of AK-56 rifle with the help  of\n      gas cutter.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">      I also went to the place to see that no mishap takes  place.   When  I\n      went there I saw that he was fumbling with the gas cutter and  was  in\n      no position to destroy the pieces properly.  Then I adjusted  the  gas\n      and started melting the pieces of AK-56  rifle  myself  with  the  gas\n      cutter.  These parts were having lot of grease on them so lot of smoke\n      was coming out.  Somehow, I managed to destroy all the parts of  AK-56\n      which he had brought in the bag.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">      Then he took out one pistol from the bag and wanted me to destroy that\n      alo but I was quite tired and had some breathing problem  due  to  the\n      smoke which was coming out while the pieces of AK-56 reifle were being\n      destroyed.  So I told him to leave  te  weapon  with  me  and  I  will\n      destroy it some other time.  Then he collected the meted remains of AK-\n      56 rifle in a plastic bag, gave the pistol to me for  destruction  and\n      he went away.  After two days, he telephoned me and enquired whether I\n      have destroyed pistol or not.  I told him not to worry about that.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">      As I was to go to Calcutta on 9th April morning so  I  telephoned  and\n      called a friend of mine, by name Rusi Framrose Mulla to my house.   He\n      came to my house next day morning and I gave the  pistol  to  him  and\n      asked to keep it in sae custody as I was going out to Calcutta.  I did\n      not tell him anything about the history of the  pistol  and  told  him\n      that I will collect it as soon as I come back from Calcutta.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_109\">27)   From the above confession, the following facts emerge:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">(i)   A-118 was a sub-contractor of A-124.  A-124 was also  acquainted  with\n      A-117.

In our considered opinion the High Court ignored the fact  that\n   there is evidence  of  PW  64,  the  typist  who  had  deposed  that  the\n   preliminary warning was in fact given which was so recorded on 23-7-1999.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">      82.

A voluntary and  truthful\nconfessional statement  recorded  under  <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_144\">Section  15</a>  of  TADA  requires  no\ncorroboration.  However, as a matter of prudence, the  court  may  look  for\nsome corroboration if confession is to be used against  co-accused.   It  is\nmade clear that whether such confession requires corroboration or not  is  a\nmatter  for  the  court  to  consider  such  confession  on  the  facts  and\ncircumstances of each case.   If  the  confession  made  by  an  accused  is\nvoluntary and true, it is admissible against  co-accused  as  a  substantive\npiece of evidence and minor  and  curable  irregularities  in  recording  of\nconfession, such as omission in obtaining the certificate of  the  competent\nofficer with respect to the confession do not affect  the  admissibility  of\nthe said evidence.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">Retracted Confessions:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">38)   It has been contended that since the confession  of  the  appellant  -\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">Sanjay Dutt (A-117) has been retracted, hence, it is not trustworthy and  it\nwould not be safe to place reliance upon it.

There is one more point which we  would  like  to  discuss  i.e.\n   whether pointing out a material object  by  the  accused  furnishing  the\n   information is a necessary concomitant of <a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_179\">Section 27</a>. We think  that  the\n   answer should be in the negative. Though in most of the cases the  person\n   who makes the disclosure himself leads the police officer  to  the  place\n   where an object is concealed and points out the same to him, however,  it\n   is not essential that there should be such pointing out in order to  make\n   the information admissible under <a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_180\">Section 27</a>. It could very well  be  that\n   on the basis of information furnished by the accused,  the  investigating\n   officer may go to the spot in the company of other witnesses and  recover\n   the material object. By doing  so,  the  investigating  officer  will  be\n   discovering a fact viz. the concealment of an incriminating  article  and\n   the knowledge of the accused furnishing  the  information  about  it.  In\n   other words, where the information furnished by the person in custody  is\n   verified by the police officer by going to  the  spot  mentioned  by  the\n   informant and finds it to be correct, that amounts to discovery  of  fact\n   within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_181\">Section 27</a>. Of course, it is subject to  the  rider\n   that the information so furnished was the immediate and  proximate  cause\n   of discovery. If the police officer chooses not  to  take  the  informant\n   accused  to  the  spot,  it  will  have  no  bearing  on  the  point   of\n   admissibility under <a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 27</a>, though it may be one of the aspects  that\n   goes into evaluation of that particular piece of evidence.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_208\">      145. Before parting with the discussion on the subject of  confessions\n   under <a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_183\">Section 27</a>, we may briefly refer to the legal position  as  regards\n   joint disclosures. This point assumes relevance in the  context  of  such\n   disclosures made by the first two accused viz.  Afzal  and  Shaukat.  The\n   admissibility of information said to have been furnished by both of  them\n   leading to the discovery of the hideouts of the deceased  terrorists  and\n   the recovery of a laptop computer, a mobile phone and cash of Rs 10 lakhs\n   from the truck in which they were found at Srinagar is in issue.  Learned\n   Senior Counsel Mr Shanti Bhushan and Mr Sushil Kumar  appearing  for  the\n   accused contend, as  was  contended  before  the  High  Court,  that  the\n   disclosure and pointing out attributed to both cannot fall within the ken\n   of <a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_184\">Section 27</a>, whereas it is the contention of Mr Gopal Subramanium  that\n   there  is  no  taboo  against  the  admission  of  such  information   as\n   incriminating evidence against both the accused informants. Some  of  the\n   High Courts have taken the view that the wording “a person” excludes  the\n   applicability of the section to more than one person. But,  that  is  too\n   narrow a view to be  taken.  Joint  disclosures,  to  be  more  accurate,\n   simultaneous disclosures, per se, are not inadmissible under <a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_185\">Section  27</a>.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">   “A person accused” need not necessarily be a single person, but it  could\n   be plurality of the accused. It seems to us that the real reason for  not\n   acting upon the joint disclosures by taking resort to <a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_186\">Section 27</a>  is  the\n   inherent difficulty in placing reliance on such information  supposed  to\n   have emerged from the mouths of two or more accused at a time.  In  fact,\n   joint or simultaneous disclosure is a myth, because two or  more  accused\n   persons would not have uttered informatory words in a  chorus.  At  best,\n   one person would have made the statement  orally  and  the  other  person\n   would have stated so substantially in similar  terms  a  few  seconds  or\n   minutes later, or the second person would have given unequivocal  nod  to\n   what has been said by the first person. Or, two persons in custody may be\n   interrogated separately and simultaneously and both of them  may  furnish\n   similar information leading to the discovery of fact. Or, in rare  cases,\n   both the accused may reduce the information into writing  and  hand  over\n   the written notes to the police officer at the same time. We do not think\n   that such disclosures by two or more persons in police custody go out  of\n   the purview of <a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_187\">Section 27</a> altogether. If information is given  one  after\n   the  other  without  any  break,  almost  simultaneously,  and  if   such\n   information is followed up by pointing out the material thing by both  of\n   them, we find no good reason to eschew such evidence from the  regime  of\n   <a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_188\">Section 27</a>. However, there  may  be  practical  difficulties  in  placing\n   reliance on such evidence. It may be difficult for the witness (generally\n   the police officer), to depose which accused spoke what words and in what\n   sequence. In other words, the deposition in  regard  to  the  information\n   given by the two accused may be exposed to criticism from the  standpoint\n   of  credibility  and  its  nexus  with   discovery.   Admissibility   and\n   credibility are  two  distinct  aspects,  as  pointed  out  by  Mr  Gopal\n   Subramanium. Whether and to what extent such  a  simultaneous  disclosure\n   could be relied upon by the Court is really a  matter  of  evaluation  of\n   evidence……”\n\n\n   It was contended that under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_189\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, only recovery\nof object is permissible and identification of the  person  instead  of  the\nplace where the article is to be found  cannot  attract  the  provisions  of\n<a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_190\">Section 27</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_159\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"195961\" id=\"span_52\">62)   The very same situation has been considered by this  Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/195961/\" id=\"a_191\">Jaffar\nHussain Dastagir vs. State of Maharashtra</a>, (1969) 2  SCC  872,  875  wherein\nthe following observations are pertinent:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_209\">   “4…..In order that the section may apply the prosecution  must  establish\n   that the information given by the appellant led to the discovery of  some\n   fact deposed to by him. It is evident that the discovery must be of  some\n   fact which the police had not previously learnt from  other  sources  and\n   that the knowledge of the fact was first derived from  information  given\n   by the accused. If the police had no information before of the complicity\n   of Accused 3 with the crime and had no idea as to  whether  the  diamonds\n   would be found with him and the appellant had made  a  statement  to  the\n   police that he knew where the diamonds were and would lead  them  to  the\n   person who had them, it can be said that the discovery  of  the  diamonds\n   with the third accused was  a  fact  deposed  to  by  the  appellant  and\n   admissible in evidence under <a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_192\">Section 27</a>. However, if it be shown that the\n   police already knew that Accused 3 had got the diamonds but did not  know\n   where the said accused was to be  found,  it  cannot  be  said  that  the\n   information given by the appellant that Accused 3 had  the  diamonds  and\n   could be pointed out in a large crowd at the  waiting  hall  led  to  the\n   discovery of a fact proving his complicity  with  any  crime  within  the\n   meaning of <a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_193\">Section 27</a>. The fact deposed to by him would at best  lead  to\n   the discovery of the whereabouts of Accused 3.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_210\">      5. Under <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_194\">Section 25</a> of the Evidence  Act  no  confession  made  by  an\n   accused to a police officer can be admitted in evidence against  him.  An\n   exception to this is  however  provided  by  <a href=\"/doc/156450655/\" id=\"a_195\">Section  26</a>  which  makes  a\n   confessional statement made before a Magistrate  admissible  in  evidence\n   against an accused notwithstanding the fact that he was in the custody of\n   the police when he made the incriminating  statement.  <a href=\"/doc/27592018/\" id=\"a_196\">Section  27</a>  is  a\n   proviso to <a href=\"/doc/156450655/\" id=\"a_197\">Section 26</a> and makes admissible so much of  the  statement  of\n   the accused which leads to the discovery of a fact deposed to by him  and\n   connected with the crime, irrespective of  the  question  whether  it  is\n   confessional or otherwise. The essential ingredient  of  the  section  is\n   that the information given by the accused must lead to the  discovery  of\n   the fact which is the direct outcome of such information. Secondly,  only\n   such portion of the information given as is distinctly connected with the\n   said recovery is admissible against the accused. Thirdly,  the  discovery\n   of the fact must relate to the commission of some offence. The embargo on\n   statements of the accused before the police will not  apply  if  all  the\n   above conditions are fulfilled. If an accused charged  with  a  theft  of\n   articles or receiving stolen articles, within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/812083/\" id=\"a_198\">Section  411</a>\n   IPC states to the police, “I will show you  the  articles  at  the  place\n   where I have kept them” and the articles are actually found there,  there\n   can be no doubt that the information given by him led to the discovery of\n   a fact i.e.  keeping  of  the  articles  by  the  accused  at  the  place\n   mentioned. The discovery of the fact deposed to in such a case is not the\n   discovery of the articles but the discovery of the fact that the articles\n   were kept by the accused at a particular place. In principle there is  no\n   difference between the above statement and that made by the appellant  in\n   this case which in effect is that “I will show you the person to  whom  I\n   have given the diamonds exceeding 200 in  number”.  The  only  difference\n   between the two statements is that a “named person”  is  substituted  for\n   “the place” where the article is kept. In neither case are  the  articles\n   or the diamonds the fact discovered.”\n\nRecoveries:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_211\">63)   The rod and the spring recovered from the  possession  of  A-124  were\nsent to FSL for examination.

The\nother case is of <a href=\"/doc/402202/\" id=\"a_201\">Prakash Kumar</a> (supra), wherein this Court  held  that  even\nif the accused was to be acquitted of the TADA charges,  still  in  a  joint\ntrial, the confessions recorded under <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_202\">Section 15</a> of TADA can be relied  upon\nin respect of the said accused.

There is no controversy about the facts necessary  to  constitute\n   the first  two  ingredients.  For  proving  the  non-existence  of  facts\n   constituting the third ingredient of the offence, the  accused  would  be\n   entitled to rebut the above statutory  presumption  and  prove  that  his\n   unauthorised possession of any such arms and ammunition etc.  was  wholly\n   unrelated to any terrorist  or  disruptive  activity  and  the  same  was\n   neither used nor available  in  that  area  for  any  such  use  and  its\n   availability in a “notified area” was innocuous. Whatever be  the  extent\n   of burden on  the  accused  to  prove  the  non-existence  of  the  third\n   ingredient, as a matter of law he has such a right which flows  from  the\n   basic right of the  accused  in  every  prosecution  to  prove  the  non-\n   existence of a fact essential to constitute an ingredient of the  offence\n   for which he is being tried. If the  accused  succeeds  in  proving  non-\n   existence of the facts necessary to constitute the third ingredient alone\n   after his unauthorised possession of any such arms and ammunition etc. in\n   a notified area is proved by the prosecution, then he cannot be convicted\n   under <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_204\">Section 5</a> of the TADA Act and would  be  dealt  with  and  punished\n   under the general law. It is obviously to meet situations  of  this  kind\n   that <a href=\"/doc/128238853/\" id=\"a_205\">Section 12</a> was incorporated in the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_206\">TADA Act</a>.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_218\">      28. The non-obstante clause in <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_207\">Section 5</a> of the TADA  Act  shows  that\n   within  a  notified  area,  the  general  law  relating  to  unauthorised\n   possession of any of the specified arms and ammunition etc. is superseded\n   by the special enactment for that area, namely, the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_208\">TADA Act</a>. If  however\n   the third ingredient to constitute the offence under  <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_209\">Section  5</a>  of  the\n   TADA Act is negatived by the accused while the first two ingredients  are\n   proved to make out an offence punishable under the general  law,  namely,\n   the <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_210\">Arms Act</a>, then the Designated Court is empowered  to  deal  with  the\n   situation in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/128238853/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 12</a>  of  the  TADA  Act.  <a href=\"/doc/128238853/\" id=\"a_212\">Section  12</a>\n   itself shows that Parliament envisaged a  situation  in  which  a  person\n   tried under the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_213\">TADA Act</a> of any offence may ultimately be found  to  have\n   committed any other offence punishable under any other law  and  in  that\n   situation, the Designated Court is empowered to punish  the  accused  for\n   the offence under such other law. The offence under <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_214\">Section 5</a> of the TADA\n   Act is graver and visited with more severe punishment as compared to  the\n   corresponding offence under the general  law.  This  is  because  of  the\n   greater propensity of misuse of such  arms  and  ammunition  etc.  for  a\n   terrorist or disruptive act  within  a  notified  area.  If  the  assumed\n   propensity of such use is negatived by  the  accused,  the  offence  gets\n   reduced to one under the general law and is punishable  only  thereunder.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_162\">   In such a situation, the accused is punished in the same  manner  as  any\n   other person found to be in unauthorised possession of any such arms  and\n   ammunition etc. outside a notified area. The presumption in law is of the\n   greater and natural  danger  arising  from  its  unauthorised  possession\n   within a notified area more prone to terrorist or disruptive activities.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">      37. It is a settled rule of criminal jurisprudence that the burden  on\n   an accused of proving a fact for rebutting a statutory presumption in his\n   defence is not as heavy as on the prosecution to prove  its  case  beyond\n   reasonable  doubt  but  the  lighter  burden  of  proving   the   greater\n   probability. Thus, the burden on the accused of rebutting  the  statutory\n   presumption which arises against him under <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 5</a> of the TADA  Act  on\n   proof by the prosecution that the accused was in unauthorised  possession\n   of any of the specified arms and ammunition etc. within a notified  area,\n   is of greater probability. When the prosecution has proved  these  facts,\n   it has to do nothing more and conviction under <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_216\">Section 5</a> of the TADA  Act\n   must follow unless  the  accused  rebuts  the  statutory  presumption  by\n   proving that any such arms and ammunition etc. was neither used  nor  was\n   meant to be used for a terrorist or disruptive activity. No further nexus\n   of his unauthorised possession of the same with any specific terrorist or\n   disruptive activity is required to  be  proved  by  the  prosecution  for\n   proving the offence under <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_217\">Section  5</a>  of  the  TADA  Act.  The  nexus  is\n   implicit, unless  rebutted,  from  the  fact  of  unauthorised  conscious\n   possession of any such  weapon  etc.  within  a  notified  area  and  the\n   inherent lethal and hazardous nature  and  potential  of  the  same.  The\n   observations of Sahai, J. alone  in  Kartar  Singh1  cannot  be  read  to\n   enlarge the burden on the prosecution to  prove  the  implicit  nexus  by\n   evidence aliunde, or to require the prosecution to  prove  anything  more\n   than what we have indicated.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_164\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"402202\" id=\"span_56\">69)   Similary, in <a href=\"/doc/402202/\" id=\"a_218\">Prakash Kumar</a> (supra), this Court held as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_219\">      “18.

Does it mean: “Thou shalt have teeth, but not bite?” We\n   think not. When the courts have the power to try, it is  implicit  in  it\n   that they have the power to convict  also.  In  the  present  case,  sub-\n   section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/128238853/\" id=\"a_233\">Section 12</a> expressly empowered  the  Designated  Court  to\n   convict the accused person of such other offence and  pass  any  sentence\n   authorised by the Act — if the  offence  is  connected  with  such  other\n   offence and — if it is found that the accused person  has  committed  any\n   other offence.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_169\">      36. <a href=\"/doc/31911315/\" id=\"a_234\">Section 12(1)</a> as quoted above authorises the Designated  Court  to\n   try offences under TADA along with another offence with which the accused\n   may be charged under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_235\">CrPC</a> at the same trial. The only embargo imposed  on\n   the exercise of the power is that the offence  under  TADA  is  connected\n   with any other offence  being  tried  together.  Further,  <a href=\"/doc/175018089/\" id=\"a_236\">Section  12(2)</a>\n   provides that the Designated Court may  convict  the  accused  person  of\n   offence under that Act or any rule made thereunder or under any other law\n   and pass any sentence authorised under that Act or the Rules or under any\n   other law, as the case may be for  the  punishment  thereof,  if  in  the\n   course of any trial under TADA the accused  persons  are  found  to  have\n   committed any offence either under that Act or  any  rule  or  under  any\n   other law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_170\">      37.

The language “if the offence is connected with such  other\n   offence” employed in <a href=\"/doc/31911315/\" id=\"a_238\">Section 12(1)</a> of the Act has great significance. The\n   necessary corollary is that once the other offence is connected with  the\n   offence under TADA and if the accused is charged under the Code and tried\n   together in the same trial, the Designated Court is empowered to  convict\n   the accused for the offence under any other law, notwithstanding the fact\n   that no offence under TADA is made out.

Where, after taking cognizance of any  offence,  a  Designated\n      Court is of opinion that the offence is not triable by it,  it  shall,\n      notwithstanding that it has  no  jurisdiction  to  try  such  offence,\n      transfer the case for the trial of such offence to  any  court  having\n      jurisdiction under the Code  and  the  court  to  which  the  case  is\n      transferred may proceed with the trial of the offence  as  if  it  had\n      taken cognizance of the offence.”\n                                          (emphasis supplied)\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_172\">      42. It is contended that the words “after taking cognizance”  employed\n   in <a href=\"/doc/59750862/\" id=\"a_241\">Section 18</a> of the Act would include any stage of trial  including  the\n   stage when the judgment is to  be  delivered.  This  submission  is  also\n   misconceived. If it ought to have been the intention of  the  legislature\n   they could have said so. The  legislature  deliberately  uses  the  words\n   “after taking cognizance of any offence” to mean that <a href=\"/doc/59750862/\" id=\"a_242\">Section 18</a> would be\n   attracted only at the stage where the Designated Court  takes  cognizance\n   of offence i.e. after the investigation is complete and  charge-sheet  is\n   filed. The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/887219/\" id=\"a_243\">Section 209</a> CrPC on which the  counsel  for  the\n   appellants sought to rely are not in pari materia  with  <a href=\"/doc/59750862/\" id=\"a_244\">Section  18</a>.  In\n   <a href=\"/doc/887219/\" id=\"a_245\">Section  209</a>  CrPC  the  words  “after  taking  cognizance”  are   absent\n   conspicuously. <a href=\"/doc/59750862/\" id=\"a_246\">Section  18</a>  is  a  filtered  provision.  The  section  is\n   attracted only at a stage the Designated Court takes  cognizance  of  the\n   offence. It is at the stage of taking cognizance, the Designated Court is\n   expected to scan the documents and evidence collected therewith.  If  the\n   Designated Court is of the opinion that the offence is not triable by it,\n   it shall then, notwithstanding that it has no jurisdiction  to  try  such\n   offence, transfer the case for the trial of such  offence  to  any  court\n   having jurisdiction under the Code and the court to  which  the  case  is\n   transferred may proceed with the trial of the offence as if it had  taken\n   cognizance of the offence. In our view, there  is  no  ambiguity  in  the\n   language used in <a href=\"/doc/59750862/\" id=\"a_247\">Section 18</a>. If the submissions of the  counsel  for  the\n   appellant are accepted, it would amount to  reading  something  into  the\n   statute which is not there.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\">70)   In the case  on  hand,  at  the  time  of  taking  cognizance  by  the\nDesignated Court, there were sufficient evidence against the  appellants  to\nproceed against them in the joint trial.  In the case of  Sanjay  Dutt,  the\nDesignated Court took a view on the basis of his  own  confession  that  the\nweapons were not acquired for any terrorist activity but they were  acquired\nfor self-defence, therefore, acquittal was recorded  in  respect  of  charge\nunder <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_248\">Section 5</a> of TADA. We fully agree with the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\">71)   For the same reasons discussed above, we are  in  agreement  with  the\nconclusion arrived at by the Designated Court and reject  the  arguments  of\nthe counsel for the other appellants, viz., A-118 and A-124.  In  the  light\nof the above discussion, we are of the view that the course adopted  by  the\ntrial Court was correct in view of both  the  abovesaid  judgments  of  this\nCourt.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_175\">Sentence:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_224\">72)   Coming to sentence, A-117 has  filed  an  additional  affidavit  dated\n24.07.2012 highlighting the circumstances under  which  he  was  implicated,\nrelationship of his family members with the  victims  etc.   It  is  not  in\ndispute that though the appellant was also charged under <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_249\">TADA Act</a>, the  fact\nremains that he was acquitted of those charges and admittedly  the  CBI  has\nnot filed an appeal against the  same.   As  said  earlier,  the  Designated\nCourt convicted him for the offences  under  <a href=\"/doc/17720539/\" id=\"a_250\">Sections  3</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/85348422/\" id=\"a_251\">7</a>  read  with\n<a href=\"/doc/115215639/\" id=\"a_252\">Sections 25</a>(1-A) and (1-B)(a) of the <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_253\">Arms Act, 1959</a>.  Consequently,  in  his\nadditional affidavit, the appellant has asserted  that  he  is  entitled  to\nseek the benefit of <a href=\"/doc/14315/\" id=\"a_254\">Section 4</a> of Probation of Offenders Act.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_176\">73)   The appellant (A-117) asserted that though  the  prosecution  involved\nhim in Bombay Bomb Blast Case that he had knowledge  as  to  the  conspiracy\nand had kept in his possession fire arms and ammunitions  as  well  as  hand\ngrenades knowing that the same were from the  consignment  that  had  landed\nfor use in the said Blasts, the fact remains that the Designated  Court  did\nnot accept the prosecution story against him and  rejected  his  involvement\nin the conspiracy as well as any knowledge of the events  as  charged.   The\nTADA Court has also held that the prosecution has failed to prove  that  the\nalleged arms in possession of the  appellant  were  from  the  same  alleged\nconsignment that was used in the said blasts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">74)   It was also contended from the side of the appellant that in the  year\n1992-93, the appellant and his  family  members  were  involved  in  helping\npeople residing in riots  affected  areas,  more  particularly,  Behrampada,\npredominantly having a Muslim population which was objectionable to  certain\ngroup of  persons  who  were  of  the  opinion  that  the  Dutt  family  was\nsympathizers of only the Muslim  community.   In  fact,  this  leads  to  an\nattack on Sunil Dutt in January, 1993 as well  as  threatening  phone  calls\nwere being received at their residence,  including  threats  to  the  family\nmembers being  killed  as  well  as  the  sisters  of  the  appellant  being\nkidnapped and raped.  This lead to a great and serious apprehension that  an\nattack could be perpetrated upon the Dutt family in view of  the  fact  that\nShri Sunil Dutt had already been attacked.  This  apprehension  was  clearly\nset out in the letter of Shri Sunil Dutt to the then DCP of Zone  VII  dated\n06.01.1993, wherein he asked for  enhancing  security  arrangements  further\nand for more police protection at his house as deposed  by  PW-219  in  this\ncase.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_178\">75)   It is stated that A-117 had  no  previous  involvement  or  conviction\nprior to one in 1992 which ended in acquittal.  Thus, according to  him,  he\nis not a previous offender or a convict. In the event, this  Court  releases\nthe appellant  on  Probation  under  the  provisions  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/167447/\" id=\"a_255\">Probation  of\nOffenders Act</a>, neither  any  injustice  would  occasion  to  anyone  as  the\noffence in which he was convicted, is not even  a  social  offence  nor  any\nprejudice be caused to the prosecution.   He  asserted  that  he  is  not  a\nhabitual offender, and is not likely to commit any offence in  future.   The\nTADA Court did not get any opportunity to complain about the conduct of  the\nappellant in 19 years.  He further submitted that he has also  suffered  the\nagony of long trial of 13 ½ (thirteen and a half)  years.   The  stress  and\ntrauma of the same, besides the fact that he  has  carried  the  tag  of  an\nalleged terrorist for 13 ½ (thirteen and a half) years  though  unwarranted,\nand has been deprived of the company of his daughter,  is  a  punishment  in\nitself. He has also stated that he had  suffered  mentally,  physically  and\nemotionally in the last several years.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_179\">76)   He also informed this Court that he got  married  again  in  the  year\n2008 and is blessed with two children aged 1  and  ½  years  and  they  need\ntheir father’s presence in their life.  He further  submitted  that  he  has\nbeen actively involved in an AIDS charity and  raises  funds  for  the  free\ntreatment of aids patients who cannot afford the same, besides visiting  the\nhospitals/centres.  It is further submitted that  he  is  on  the  Board  of\nDirectors of “Save the Children Foundation” and  helping  in  raising  funds\nfor  children  who  are  needy,  orphaned  and  destitute  as  their   Brand\nAmbassador for a long time, even prior to his being charged in this case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_180\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1690903\" id=\"span_58\">77)   In  view  of  the  above,  learned  senior  counsel  for  A-117  draws\nattention of this Court towards the following decisions, viz.,  <a href=\"/doc/1690903/\" id=\"a_256\">Ved  Prakash\nvs. State of Haryana</a>, 1981 (1) SCC 447, this Court observed that the  social\nbackground and the personal factors of  the  crime-doer  are  very  relevant\nalthough in practice Criminal Courts  have  hardly  paid  attention  to  the\nsocial milieu or the personal circumstances of the offender.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_181\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1187238\" id=\"span_59\">78)   In <a href=\"/doc/1187238/\" id=\"a_257\">Jugal Kishore vs. State of Bihar</a>,  (1972)  2  SCC  633  this  Court\nobserved that the modern criminal jurisprudence recognizes that no one is  a\nborn criminal and that a good many crimes are the product of  socio-economic\nmilieu.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_182\">79)   This Court in Ratanlal vs. State of  Punjab,  (1964)  7  SCR  676  has\nobserved to the effect that the <a href=\"/doc/167447/\" id=\"a_258\">Probation  of  Offenders  Act</a>,  was  enacted\nwith a view to provide for the release of offenders  of  certain  categories\non Probation or alter due admonition and for  matters  connected  therewith.\nThe object of the Act  is  to  prevent  the  conversion  of  offenders  into\nobdurate  criminals  as  a  result  of  their  association   with   hardened\ncriminals.  The above object is in consonance with the present trend in  the\nfield of penology, according to which,  efforts  should  be  made  to  bring\nabout correction and reformation of the  individual  offenders  and  not  to\nresort to retributive justice.  Although, not much can be done for  hardened\ncriminals, considerable stress has been laid on  bringing  about  reform  of\noffenders  not  guilty  of  serious  offences  and   of   preventing   their\nassociation with hardened criminals.  <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_259\">The Act</a>  gives  statutory  recognition\nto the above objective.  It is, therefore, provided  that  offenders  should\nnot be sent to jail, except in certain circumstances.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_183\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"987966\" id=\"span_60\">80)   The scope of <a href=\"/doc/14315/\" id=\"a_260\">Section 4</a> of the  Probation  of  Offenders  Act  is  much\nwider.  It applies to  any  person  found  guilty  of  having  committed  an\noffence not punishable with death or imprisonment for life.   The  same  has\nalso been held by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/987966/\" id=\"a_261\">Chhani vs. State of U.P.</a>, (2006) 5 SCC  396.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_184\">81)   <a href=\"/doc/755395/\" id=\"a_262\">Section 360</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure  does  not  provide  for\nany role for probation officers in  assisting  the  courts  in  relation  to\nsupervision and other matters while the  <a href=\"/doc/167447/\" id=\"a_263\">Probation  of  Offenders  Act</a>  does\nmake such a provision.  While <a href=\"/doc/1678715/\" id=\"a_264\">Section 12</a> of the Probation of  Offenders  Act\nstates that a person found  guilty  of  an  offence  and  dealt  with  under\n<a href=\"/doc/17720539/\" id=\"a_265\">Section 3</a> or  4  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/167447/\" id=\"a_266\">Probation  of  Offenders  Act</a>,  shall  not  suffer\ndisqualification, if any, attached to the conviction  of  an  offence  under\nany  law.   The  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_267\">Code  of  Criminal  Procedure</a>  does  not  contain  parallel\nprovision.  Two statutes with such  significant  differences  could  not  be\nintended to co-exist at the same time in the same area.   Such  co-existence\nwould lead to anamolous results.  The intention to retain the provisions  of\n<a href=\"/doc/167447/\" id=\"a_268\">Section 360</a> of the Code and the Probation of Offenders Act as applicable  at\nthe same time in a given area cannot be  gathered  from  the  provisions  of\nSection 360 or any other provisons of the Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_185\">82)   Keeping those information in the form of an additional affidavit,  let\nus consider  his  claim  and  eligibility  of  applying  <a href=\"/doc/14315/\" id=\"a_269\">Section  4</a>  of  the\nProbation of Offenders Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_186\">83)   Sub-<a href=\"/doc/14315/\" id=\"a_270\">section 4</a> of the Probation of Offenders  Act  contains  the  words\n“Notwithstanding anything contained in any other law for the time  being  in\nforce”.  The above non obstante clause points to  the  conclusion  that  the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/14315/\" id=\"a_271\">Section 4</a> of the Probation of  Offenders  Act  would  have  an\noverriding effect and shall  prevail  if  the  other  conditions  prescribed\ntherein are fulfilled.  Those conditions are:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_225\">(i)   The accused is  found  guilty  of  having  committed  an  offence  not\n      punishable with death or imprisonment for life;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_226\">(ii)  The Court finding him guilty is of the opinion that having  regard  to\n      the circumstances of the case, including the nature of the offence and\n      the character of the offender, it  is  expedient  to  release  him  on\n      probation;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_227\">(iii) The accused in such an event  enters  into  a  bond  with  or  without\n      sureties to appear and receive sentence when called upon  during  such\n      period not exceeding three years as the court may direct and,  in  the\n      meantime, to keep the peace and be of good behaviour.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_228\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"763947\" id=\"span_61\">84)   The underlying object of the above provisions  obviously  is  that  an\naccused person should be given a chance of reformation, which he would  lose\nin  case  he  is  incarcerated  in  prison  and  associates  with   hardened\ncriminals.  It is  submitted  that  the  provisions  of  the  said  Act  are\nbeneficial   provisions   and,   therefore,   they   should   receive   wide\ninterpretation and should not be read in a restricted sence vide  <a href=\"/doc/763947/\" id=\"a_272\">Ishar  Das\nvs. State of Punjab</a>, 1973 (2) SCC 65.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_229\">85)   <a href=\"/doc/14315/\" id=\"a_273\">Section 4</a> of the Probation of Offenders Act applies to  all  kinds  of\noffenders, whether under or above the age of  21  years.   This  section  is\nintended  to  attempt  possible  reformation  of  an  offender  instead   of\ninflicting upon him the normal punishment of his  crime.   It  is  submitted\nthat it is settled law that while extending benefit of the  said  provision,\nthis  Court  has  to  exercise  its  discretion   having   regard   to   the\ncircumstances in which the crime was committed,  viz.,  the  age,  character\nand antecedents of the offender.  It is also settled law that such  exercise\nof discretion needs a sense of responsibility.  The section itself is  clear\nthat before applying  the  same,  this  Court  should  carefully  take  into\nconsideration the attendant circumstances.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_230\">86)   The circumstances and the  nature  of  the  offence  as  analysed  and\ndiscussed above are so serious and we are of  the  view  that  they  do  not\nwarrant A-117 the benefit of the provisions of the  <a href=\"/doc/167447/\" id=\"a_274\">Probation  of  Offenders\nAct</a>, however, taking note of various aspects,  we  reduce  the  sentence  to\nminimum period, viz., 6 years to 5 years.

Consquently, the appeal is dismissed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_232\">88)   Insofar as A-124 is concerned, the Designated Court has convicted  him\nunder <a href=\"/doc/17720539/\" id=\"a_275\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/85348422/\" id=\"a_276\">7</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/115215639/\" id=\"a_277\">Sections 25</a>(1-A)(1-B)(a) of the  <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_278\">Arms  Act,\n1959</a>, as well as under <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_279\">Section 201</a> of IPC and sentenced him  to  undergo  RI\nfor 2 years on both the counts separately.  A perusal of all  the  materials\nrelating to A-124 shows that  the  Designated  Court  itself  convicted  and\nsentenced him under <a href=\"/doc/115215639/\" id=\"a_280\">Section 25</a>(1-B)(a) of the <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_281\">Arms Act</a>  along  with  <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_282\">Section\n201</a>  of  IPC.

The  only\npoint for consideration in this appeal is whether  the  order  of  acquittal\nrendered by the Designated Court is justifiable or requires interference  by\nthis Court.  Keeping  the  basic  principles  in  mind,  in  a  matter  when\nacquittal is recorded by the trial  Court  and  the  grounds  on  which  the\nAppellate Court can interfere, let us consider  and  dispose  of  the  above\nappeal.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_240\">94)   It is not in dispute that A-120 has not made any  confession  and  his\nco-accused A-125 relied  on  by  the  prosecution  has  also  not  made  any\nconfession and even the confessional statements of other  co-accused  failed\nto disclose any involvement of A-120 in any  manner.   The  only  allegation\nagainst the present accused is that of seizure of a box containing a  pistol\nfrom his house.  The Designated Court, after  considering  the  evidence  of\npanch witness (PW-211) regarding the  statement  made  by  A-125  and  after\nfinding that there was lot of variation in their statements  and  bereft  of\nmaterials about the  role  of  A-120  and  further  finding  that  different\nstories have been projected by the prosecution, refused to accept the  same.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_196\"> After analyzing the entire statement of A-125, the trial Court  came  to  a\nconclusion that the same are insufficient to  connect  A-120  as  being  the\nperson who had received the same pistol and rounds.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_197\">95)   As has been rightly observed by the Designated Court, mere  recoveries\nof a .9mm pistol and the rounds from the bungalow  of  A-120  would  not  be\nsufficient to connect him with the said articles.  It is  settled  law  that\nthe recoveries made must be found to have been made as a consequence to  the\nstatement made by the accused in custody.  In other words, if the  nexus  in\nbetween is not established, the said statement made  would  be  inadmissible\nin evidence.  The Designated  Court,  after  considering  the  well  settled\nprinciples and the materials placed  concluded  that  “it  will  be  further\nnecessary to say that scrutiny of the evidence also does not  reveals  A-120\nhaving purchased .9mm pistol and rounds……”  The Designated  Court  has  also\nconcluded that even if the statement made by A-125  is  acceptable,  in  the\nabsence of any supporting oral and documentary evidence and taking  note  of\nthe improvement made by panch witness  as  well  as  in  the  statements  of\nwitnesses stage by stage “hardly there would be any evidence to  connect  A-\n120 with the relevant contraband articles” and rightly discarded the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_198\">96)    In the light of the categorical finding by the trial Court and  after\nanalyzing the materials placed by the prosecution, we fully concur with  the\nsaid conclusion and according  to  us,  with  the  above  said  insufficient\nevidence, the order  of  acquittal  cannot  be  lightly  interfered  in  the\npresent appeal, consequently, the appeal filed by  the  CBI  fails  and  the\nsame is dismissed.</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n                      Criminal Appeal No. 1104 of 2007\n\n\nSamir Ahmed Hingora (A-53)                        ....

They will bring one vehicle  loaded  with  weapons.\nYou make arrangements for off-loading and hand over  weapons  to  A-117  and\nthe rest  will  be  taken  by  them  for  distribution  to  other  persons”.\nFurther, inspite of the unwillingness of Hanif Kandawala,  he  proceeded  to\nhelp the co-accused.

In addition to the same,  the\nappellant was also associated with co-accused even after  the  blasts  which\nfact is clearly discernible from the confession of A-96 wherein  she  stated\nthat after coming back to her house, her father informed her that  owner  of\nMagnum Videos (A-53) had come and gave Rs. 50,000/- for help.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_226\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"194120\" id=\"span_62\">107)  Mr. Rohtagi, learned senior counsel  for  the  appellant  pointed  out\nthat without establishing the pre-requisites as held in the  case  of  <a href=\"/doc/194120/\" id=\"a_352\">State\nvs. Nalini</a>, (1999) 5 SCC 253, it is only on the ground of acquaintance  with\nthe main conspirators and alleged knowledge acquired  on  phone  that  after\nhanding over weapons to A-117, the balance would be taken for  distribution,\nfor which the appellant has been erroneously convicted under  <a href=\"/doc/105771932/\" id=\"a_353\">Section  3(3)</a>.\nWe are unable to accept the said claim.  We have  already  pointed  out  the\nappellant’s proximity with Anees Ibrahim.  It was  on  the  instructions  of\nAnees that the arms were  delivered  to  Sanjay  Dutt  and  because  of  the\nrelationship of Anees and Tiger/Dawood  Ibrahim,  it  establishes  a  strong\nlink between A-53 and Anees.   Though  it  was  argued  that  there  was  no\nproximity between the appellant  and  Anees,  materials  relied  on  by  the\nprosecution clearly prove their relationship.  Further,  their  relationship\ncannot be simply  construed  as  a  business  relationship.   The  materials\nplaced on record by the prosecution, relied on and accepted by  the  Special\nJudge show that the appellant was guilty of  distributing  arms  to  persons\nother than Sanjay Dutt.  The finding recorded by the trial Judge is that  A-\n53 not only distributed weapons to A-117 but also to third parties.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_227\">108)  The CBI has successfully placed materials to show that  the  appellant\nwas responsible for arranging garages for the storage of weapons.   We  have\nalready  adverted  to  the  confessional  statement  of  A-41   wherein   in\ncategorical terms it was asserted that A-53, the  present  appellant,  along\nwith A-41 and A-139 searched for garages in Pali Hill  areas,  Bandra  where\nthe weapons could be off loaded and after that they were to  be  distributed\nto various persons as suggested by Anees Ibrahim.  In view of the same,  the\nargument of the learned senior counsel for the appellant  is  liable  to  be\nrejected.  The confessional statement of A-41 also shows that the  appellant\nhelped the co-accused persons to look for garages.   In  such  circumstance,\nit cannot be claimed that at no point of time A-53 was ever  aware  of  what\nwas to be stored in the garages.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_228\">109)  Mr. Rohtagi, learned senior  counsel  disputed  the  admissibility  of\nconfession made by the appellant and voluntariness of  his  statement.   The\nDesignated Court, on going through the evidence of the officer who  recorded\nhis confession, the procedure followed, opportunity given to the  appellant,\nrejected the similar objection raised before him.  Upon  going  through  all\nthe materials, we agree with the reasoning of the Special Judge and  we  are\nof the view that there is no flaw  in  the  procedure  while  recording  the\nconfession of the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_229\">Appeal by the State of Maharashtra through CBI:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_284\">Criminal Appeal No. 1026 of 2012\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_285\">110)  Though Mr. Rawal, learned ASG, prayed for conviction of A-53  for  the\ncharge framed at head firstly, i.e.,  larger  conspiracy,  in  view  of  the\nabove discussion, we are satisfied that the  materials  available  establish\nhis involvement only to  the  extent  of  the  smaller  conspiracy  and  the\nDesignated Court was justified in arriving at such conclusion and  we  fully\nagree with the same, hence, the appeal filed by the State is  liable  to  be\ndismissed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_286\">Sentence:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_287\">111)  According to learned senior counsel  for  A-53,  out  of  9  years  of\nsentence awarded, he has completed 6 ½ (six and a half) years and there  are\nseveral extenuating circumstances for reduction of the sentence.

It has also been observed that  such  confessional\n      statement is admissible as a substantive piece  of  evidence.  It  was\n      further observed that the said confession need not be tested  for  the\n      contradictions to be found in the confession of the co-accused. It  is\n      for that reason that even if the other oral evidence goes  counter  to\n      the statements made in the confession, one&#x27;s confession can  be  found\n      to be voluntary and reliable and  it  can  become  the  basis  of  the\n      conviction.”\n\n\nIn addition to the proposition of law mentioned above, the acceptability  of\nconfession of co-accused has already been discussed and  considered  in  the\nearlier part of our judgment, there is no  need  to  repeat  the  same  once\nagain.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_242\">Other evidence:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_314\">Deposition of Dilip Bhandur Gosh (PW-283)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_315\">122)  PW-283 deposed as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_316\">(i)   At  the  relevant  time,  he  was  working  as  the  watchman  in  the\n      Vidhyanchal Society.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_317\">(ii)  He further deposed that he will be able to identify the  occupants  of\n      the said society in the year 1993\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_318\">(iii) He stated that the appellant was residing on  the  first  floor  of  B\n      Wing of the said society\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_319\">(iv)  He identified the appellant before the court.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_243\">The aforesaid evidence corroborates the fact that the appellant was  staying\non the first floor of the Vidyanchal Building.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_244\">123)  Upon appreciation of the entire evidence, the  Designated  Court  held\nas under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_320\">      “32)  With regard to the case of A-119  there  appears  similarity  in\n      many of the aspects with A-89.  With regard to the  defence  criticism\n      of the material evidence against her being in  shape  of  material  in\n      confession of  A-89  all  the  dilation  made  about  the  submissions\n      canvassed that conviction cannot be made on the basis of  material  in\n      confession of co-accused would be applicable.  In the said context, it\n      will be necessary to add that material in the confession of co-accused\n      being now held to be substantive piece of evidence and considering the\n      circumstances relevant to the role played by A-119 i.e. only 3 persons\n      being present when the relevant act of taking and storing the  weapons\n      was effected and thus there being  no  other  corroborative  material,\n      which could have been available the said  matters  in  the  confession\n      will not be liable to be discarded on the  count  of  there  being  no\n      corroborations as stated earlier.  Now considering the period in which\n      the relevant had occurred and the period after which  the  police  had\n      received the information, merely because evidence does not  reveal  of\n      any material being found at the house of A-119 will not  be  a  ground\n      for discarding the said material in the  confession  of  A-89.   As  a\n      matter of fact, event the said material itself reveals that  the  said\n      weapons were to be kept with her and were to be collected back by  Abu\n      Salem;  non-finding  of  weapon  with  her  clearly  appears   to   be\n      insignificant circumstance.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_321\">      33)   Thus the evidence having clearly denoted that weapons were  kept\n      with her for storage purpose and they were to be collected back, A-119\n      cannot be said to be in possession of contraband material as  all  the\n      time the possession of the said weapons would have been that  of  main\n      conspirator who had kept the same with her.   In  view  of  the  same,\n      alike A-89 she cannot be said to be guilty for commission  of  offence\n      under <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_390\">Section 5</a> of TADA and the relevant sections under the <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_391\">Arms  Act</a>,\n      for which she is charged  at  the  trial.   Similarly,  for  the  same\n      reasons because of which A-89 cannot be said to be guilty for  offence\n      of conspiracy.  She also cannot be said tobe guilty for commission  of\n      such offence.  It is indeed true that considering the role  played  by\n      her in storing the weapons in her house or even for  A-89  being  also\n      instrumental  for  taking  the  said  weapons  does  create  a  strong\n      suspicion  of  both  of  them  being  man  of  confidence   of   prime\n      conspirator.  However, since shrouding of suspicion  cannot  take  the\n      place of proof and there being paucity of material that both  of  them\n      had knowledge of object of any  particular  conspiracy  both  of  them\n      cannot be held guilty for commission of offence of conspiracy.   Thus,\n      alike A-89 she will be  also  required  to  be  held  not  guilty  for\n      commission of offence for which she was charged at head firstly.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_322\">      34)   However, considering the  repeated  participation  of  A-119  in\n      allowing absconding accused Anees Ibrahim to store the weapons at  her\n      house or with her, herself taking up the weapons in spite  of  knowing\n      the purpose for which the  same  were  sent  by  Anees,  the  evidence\n      pertaining to second occasion clearly revealing that the weapons  were\n      2 AK-56 Rifles  and  the  ammunition  and  thereby  all  the  evidence\n      establishing that the same being brought to India  for  commission  of\n      terrorists Act i.e. by and for the terrorists, act  committed  by  her\n      will clearly fall within the four corners of  <a href=\"/doc/105771932/\" id=\"a_392\">Section  3(3)</a>  of  TADA.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_245\">      Similarly, her act of keeping such a material in the house, even after\n      knowing the purpose for which the same were brought to  India  clearly\n      reveals that by the same she was aiding and abetting the terrorists by\n      contravening the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_393\">Arms Act</a>.   As  such  she  will  be\n      required to be held guilty for commission of offence under  <a href=\"/doc/47052902/\" id=\"a_394\">Section  6</a>\n      of TADA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_246\">      35)   As a result of the aforesaid discussion, Point No.  163  to  166\n      and so also relevant points framed for offence of conspiracy  will  be\n      required to be answered in consonance with conclusions arrived  during\n      the aforesaid discussion i.e. affirmative for holding A-89  and  A-119\n      guilty for offence under <a href=\"/doc/105771932/\" id=\"a_395\">Section 3(3)</a> of TADA and  A-119  also  guilty\n      for offence under <a href=\"/doc/47052902/\" id=\"a_396\">Section 6</a> of TADA and negative with  regard  to  the\n      other charges framed against them at a trial.  Thus Point No.  163  to\n      166 stands answered accordingly.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_247\">124)  The above discussion shows that the  Designated  Court  convicted  the\nappellant under <a href=\"/doc/105771932/\" id=\"a_397\">Section 3(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/47052902/\" id=\"a_398\">Section 6</a> of TADA only on the basis of  the\nconfessional  statement  of  A-89  and  the  evidence  of  PW-283  Chowkidar\n(watchman in the building).  Admittedly,  the  appellant,  at  no  point  of\ntime, had made any confession admitting her guilt.  Equally, it  is  not  in\ndispute that no recovery  has  been  affected  from  her  house.   The  only\nincriminating circumstance against her is the statement of A-89  that  while\nhanding over a plastic bag, he mentioned that it contains  AK-56  rifle  and\nother arms.  It is also his claim  that  after  knowing  the  contents,  she\nreceived the same and kept it in her house.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_248\">125)  Taking note of  all  these  aspects,  absolutely,  there  is  no  case\ninsofar as the main conspiracy against her and we  are  satisfied  that  the\nDesignated Court has rightly acquitted her of the main  charge  i.e.  charge\nfirstly.
