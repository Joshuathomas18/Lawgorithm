The notification under <a href=\"/doc/169774/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 4(1)</a> of the \nLand Acquisition Act, 1894 [hereinafter, &#x27;the Act&#x27;] was \nissued on 24th December 1968 and on 13th October, \n1969, declaration under <a href=\"/doc/1792838/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 6</a> of the Act was \npublished.  The Land Acquisition Collector made his \naward in October 1974 awarding Rs.12,000/- per acre \nfor &#x27;nal land&#x27; and Rs.9,000/- per acre for &#x27;chara land&#x27;.  \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">On 21.10.1974, the appellants filed an application for \nreference under <a href=\"/doc/1517117/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 18</a> of the Act for \nenhancement of compensation.  On reference, the \nlearned L.A. Judge passed an award enhancing \ncompensation, allowing Rs.36,000/- per acre and also \ngranted 15% solatium, and interest under <a href=\"/doc/981477/\" id=\"a_4\">Section \n23(2)</a> of the Act in 1985.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"82262912\" id=\"span_1\">On appeal to the High Court, the claim for \nenhancement was dismissed.  The High Court also \ndenied the appellants benefits under <a href=\"/doc/981477/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 23(2)</a> of \nthe Act by relying on the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/82262912/\" id=\"a_6\">K.S. \nParipoornan vs. State of Kerala</a>,AIR 1995 SC 1012.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\tBefore this Court, the main issues are as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(1)\tWas the High Court justified in not awarding \nenhanced compensation?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(2)\tAre the appellants entitled to solatium and \ninterest @ 30% under <a href=\"/doc/981477/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 23(2)</a> of the Act?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">Compensation payable on a piece of land \nacquired under the Act is determined by taking into \naccount the market value of the land so acquired.  The \nmost reliable way to determine the market value is to \nrely on the instances of sale of portions of the same \nland as has been acquired or adjacent lands made \nshortly before or the after the <a href=\"/doc/43654/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 4</a> notification .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">Accordingly, the appellants had produced before \nthe High Court a certified copy of an award passed by \nthe learned L.A. Judge in another acquisition \nproceedings.  In this case, the land was 150 ft. away \nfrom the lands involved in the present proceedings.  \nIn those proceedings, the learned L.A. Judge had \nawarded Rs.1 lakh per acre as compensation.  This \nwas sought to be relied on by the appellants.  The \nHigh Court chose not to rely on this document as no \nevidence was led to show that both lands are similar \nin nature having similar potentiality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">While determining the market value of land, it \nmust be with reference to a piece of land which is \ncomparable to the present lands being acquired.  It \nmust be similar in potentiality and nature.  The \ndocument which the appellants seek to rely on relates \nto land which was acquired for the purpose of Assam-\nAgartala Road.  It was 3 feet higher than the acquired \nland.  Further, the two lands were not proved to be \ncomparable in nature and potentiality.  Therefore, the \nHigh Court is right in not relying on the said document \nand disallowing the claim for enhancement for \ncompensation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">The second issue relates to the payment of \nsolatium @ 30% under <a href=\"/doc/981477/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 23(2)</a> of the Act.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">Solatium is &#x27;money comfort&#x27; quantified by the statute \nand given as a conciliatory measure for the \ncompulsory acquisition of land of the citizen, by a \nwelfare state such as India &quot;.   Thus the statutory \namount of solatium is intended to compensate the \nowner for his disinclination to part with his property.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">The main aspect that arises for consideration is \nthe issue of the rate of solatium.  By an amendment in \n1984, the rate was increased to 30% from the original \n15% by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 30(2)</a> of the Amending Act.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">This increase was given a limited retrospectivity, in \nthe sense that, the <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_11\">Amending Act</a>, under Section \n30(2) provided that the increased solatium is \napplicable to those awards passed by the Collector or \nthe Court between 30.4.1982 and 29.9.1984.  Can it \nbe said that the present case would be entitled to this \nadditional benefit?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">The award was made by the L.A. Collector way \nbefore the said period i.e. in 1974.  However, the \nreference Court passed its award after the said period, \ni.e. in 1985.  Therefore, the issue is whether the \namendment would apply to a case pending during the \nperiod of 2 years from 30.4.1982 to 29.9.1984.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">This precise issue has come up for consideration \na number of times before this Court.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"505842\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/505842/\" id=\"a_12\">Union of \nIndia v. Raghubir Singh</a>, (1989) 2 SCC 754, it was \nheld that the benefit of enhanced solatium would \napply only in cases where the award by the Collector \nor Court is made between 30.4.1982 and 24.9.1984 \nor appeals against such awards decided by the High \nCourts or this Court, whether rendered before \n24.9.1984 or after that date.  This Court found that \nthe language of the Section ruled out the applicability \nof the benefit to all pending proceedings.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"689330\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/689330/\" id=\"a_13\">Union of India v. Filip Tiago De Gama</a>, AIR \n1990 SC 981, the issue was whether the amendment \nwould apply to an award made subsequent to \n24.9.1984 even though the acquisition proceedings \nhad commenced prior to the date.  This Court looked \nat the intention behind giving retrospective effect to \nthe amending Section.  If the literal interpretation is \ntaken, it was held, it will result in an anomaly.  In \norder to avoid it, regard must be had to the purpose \nof Section 30(2).  Consequently, this Court awarded \nhigher solatium even though the Reference Court \nmade the award in 1985.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"505842\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"82262912\" id=\"span_5\">Again in <a href=\"/doc/82262912/\" id=\"a_14\">K.S. Paripoornan</a>&#x27;s case [supra], this \nCourt widened the restricted interpretation given in \n<a href=\"/doc/505842/\" id=\"a_15\">Raghubir Singh</a>&#x27;s case.  It held that the enhanced \nsolatium would apply even to a case pending at the \ntime the Act came into force.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">Following this train of thought, the benefit of \nenhanced solatium would extend to the present case.  \nDuring the period between 30.4.1982 and 29.9.1984, \nthe reference was pending in the Reference Court.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">The court&#x27;s award was passed in 1985.  Following the \nabove interpretation, the appellants are thus entitled \nto enhanced solatium @ 30% and interest under \n<a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 23(2)</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">The High Court in considering the case under \nSection 23(1-<a href=\"/doc/54424454/\" id=\"a_17\">A) of the Act</a> has committed an error.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">The appellants are entitled to solatium under <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_18\">Section \n23(2)</a> of the Act and, therefore, the reference by the \nHigh Court to Section 23(1-A) is irrelevant in the \npresent case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">The learned counsel for respondents has \ncontended that solatium is not applicable because the \n<a href=\"/doc/50799924/\" id=\"a_19\">West Bengal Land Development and Planning Act, \n1948</a>, under which this present area falls, does not \ncontemplate it.  The provision of solatium is \nmandatory and cannot be done away with.  It has \nbeen held in a number of cases that the deprivation of \nsolatium by the <a href=\"/doc/50799924/\" id=\"a_20\">West Bengal Land Development and \nPlanning Act</a> is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 8(2)</a> \nof the Act is held to be invalid. (See : Monoranjan \nRouth v. State of W.B., AIR 1972 Cal 487 and \nRamendranath v. State of W.B., AIR 1975 Cal \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">325).  Therefore, the contention that <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 8(2)</a> of \nthe Act excludes compensation by way of solatium \ndoes not hold good.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">\tIn the light of the above, the compensation @ \n36,000/- per acre as awarded by the L.A. Judge is \nupheld.  The solatium is to be paid @ 30% under \n<a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 23(2)</a> of the Act and an interest @ 9% per \nannum is also payable under <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 28</a> of the Act.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">The award made by the Reference Court as affirmed \nby the High Court shall stand modified accordingly and \nthe appeal is allowed to that extent.  No orders as to \ncosts.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">L.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T....R.\nAppeal (civil)#Appeal (civil)  4051 of 1996#1996#M/s Pepsi Foods Limited#Collector of Central Excise, Chandigarh#2003-11-25#25622#4051#P.
