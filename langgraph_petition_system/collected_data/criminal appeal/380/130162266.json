Appellant has been\nfurther convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 376</a> of IPC with ten years of RI\nand fine of Rs.500/-. In default of payment of fine, appellant is\nrequired to undergo further RI of two months each.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_2\">2.      As nobody was appearing for the appellant, this Court\nappointed Shri B.S.Gaur as counsel from the Legal Aid and\nrequested him to prepare and argue this case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.      The facts of the case, which are not in dispute, are that on\n12.1.2005 at about 12.30 am when prosecutrix was in her room,\naccused had entered her room and made himself comfortable by\nthe side of the prosecutrix, on her bed. Thereafter, he committed\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">               -( 2 )-              Criminal Appeal No.26/2006\n\nrape and when prosecutrix tried to oppose, he put a piece of cloth\nin her mouth, as a result she could not shout. Once the act was\nover, she shouted, which was heard by her sister-in-law Suman\n(PW-3) and she called Bhaggo (PW-2), mother-in-law of the\nprosecutrix, and Lalu (PW-4), husband of the prosecutrix, who\nwas available in the house of Bhaggo at a distance of 20-25\nsteps. It is also the case of prosecution that at that point of time,\nwitness Hariram (PW-6) had arrived at the scene of crime and he\nhad seen the whole incident. FIR was lodged on the same day at\n1.30 pm i.e. there is a gap of 13 hours between the incident and\nthe time when FIR was lodged.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.    It is the contention of learned counsel for the appellant that\nthis is a case of false accusation whereby appellant has been\nfalsely accused of committing rape. It is submitted that prosecutrix\n(PW-1) is habitual of making false allegations and this can be\nverified by the statements of Prosecutrix (PW-1), Bhaggo (PW-2)\nand Suman (PW-3). It is submitted that because of rivalry over\nthe election to the post of Sarpanch, accused has been falsely\nframed. It is further submitted that the version of the prosecution\nwitnesses is full of contradictions and is not reliable. He has taken\nthis Court through the detailed evidence of each of the\nprosecution witnesses, namely prosecutrix (PW-1) who has\nadmitted in her cross-examination that accused had taken about\na minute&#x27;s time in committing rape and when thereafter he started\nrunning, then her sister-in-law, who was in the neighbouring room,\ncalled her husband and mother-in-law. She has admitted that she\nhad not sustained any injury during the said incident either on the\nbody or on her face including mouth. In para 6 of her cross-\nexamination, she has admitted that accused was opposing her\nmother-in-law in the election. She also admitted that about 1 and\nhalf years prior to the present incident, she had filed a case for\ncommitting rape against Badam, Lakhan, Bhassu and Raghuvar\nand all those persons have been acquitted in that case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">5.    Bhaggo (PW-2), mother-in-law of the prosecutrix, has\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">                -( 3 )-              Criminal Appeal No.26/2006\n\nmentioned that when she reached the incident, then accused was\nnot present there. She saw her son Lalu lying down on floor and\nshe offered water to him and then he informed her that accused\nPansingh had throttled his neck and ran away. In cross-\nexamination, Bhaggo (PW-2) has admitted that she was a\ncandidate for the election to the post of Sarpanch, but later on\nshe withdrew her candidature by supporting one Dubeyji. She\nalso admitted that accused Pansingh was her opponent in the\nelection. She has further improvised the story which has not been\nmentioned by the prosecutrix to the effect that not only the\naccused had tried to scuffle with her son Lalu, but also had given\ntwo kick blows to her daughter-in-law. This portion of giving kick\nblows to her daughter-in-law is not mentioned in the statement of\nthe prosecutrix (PW-1). She has also admitted that earlier a case\nwas lodged against other persons with whom matter was\ncompromised.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">6.    Suman (PW-3), sister-in-law of the prosecutrix, has\nmentioned in her examination-in-chief that when she heard voice\nof her sister-in-law, the prosecutrix, she opened door of her room\nand came out and saw that a scuffle was going on between her\nbrother-in-law Lalu and accused Pansingh, then she went to call\nher mother-in-law. This is another material contradiction in the\nprosecution story because as per the prosecutrix it was Suman\nwho had gone and called both husband Lalu and mother-in-law\nBhaggo. Bhaggo (PW-2) has on the contrary submitted that when\nshe reached the scene of crime, her son was lying in a semi-\nconscious state. Suman (PW-3) has admitted that prosecutrix had\ninformed her that she was insulted by Pansingh. In cross-\nexamination,     she     has   admitted   that   in   the   immediate\nneighbourhood there are houses of Chironji and Bindaram. She\nfurther admitted that in the interrogation she informed the police\nthat her sister-in-law had informed her that she was insulted by\nthe accused. She further narrated that scuffle between her\nbrother-in-law and accused took place for about 5 minutes. She\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">              -( 4 )-               Criminal Appeal No.26/2006\n\nadmitted in para 3 that her mother-in-law was a candidate for\nelection to the post of Sarpanch and accused Pansingh was her\nopponent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">7.    Lalu (PW-4), husband of the prosecutrix, on the other hand\nhas narrated in his examination-in-chief that when he heard voice\nof her sister-in-law, then he came running to his house from the\nhouse of his mother where he was having dinner and he saw his\nwife in a naked state when the accused was in a compromising\nposition and was raping her. In para 2, Lalu (PW-4) has\nmentioned that they could not lodge the report in time because\nthey had first gone to Surendra Maharaj, Sarpanch, and then\nwhen they tried to approach police Station, accused met them\nwith a Farsa and threatened them with their life, as a result of\nwhich, he could not lodge the report. It is submitted that\nprosecution has not examined Sarpanch Surendra Maharaj and\nthere is no such version of the prosecutrix or Bhaggo (PW-2),\nwho had gone to lodge the report, that since the accused was\narmed with a Farsa and had threatened them, they could not\nlodge the FIR during night time.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">8.    Learned counsel for the appellant has further pointed out\nthat in the cross-examination, there is material omission and\ncontradiction in the testimony of Lalu (PW-4) inasmuch as it is not\nthe case of the prosecutrix that Lalu, her husband, had seen the\naccused committing rape on her. In reply to question that if he\nhad seen the accused committing rape on his wife, then why he\nhad not given such statement before the police in case diary\nstatement EXD/2, Lalu (PW-4) could not give any reason for such\nomission. Lalu (PW-4) has further mentioned that when he had\ncaught hold of the accused, at that point of time, his mother had\nlighted Chimni. It is submitted that this is again contradictory to\nthe statement of Suman (PW-3) that there was a source of light,\nwhereas as per the statement of Bhaggo (PW-2) when she\narrived at the scene of crime accused had already run away and\nshe saw her son lying in a semi-conscious state. In para 5, Lalu\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">               -( 5 )-               Criminal Appeal No.26/2006\n\n(PW-4) submitted that there were injury marks on the body of the\nprosecutrix and her blouse and petticoat were torn. It is further\npointed out that this is also contradictory to the version of the\nprosecutrix (PW-1), Bhaggo (PW-2) and Suman (PW-3).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">9.    Dr. Aneeta Bhilwar (PW-9), who had conducted MLC on the\nbody of the prosecutrix, categorically reported that there was no\nsign of injury on the body or private parts of the prosecutrix. There\nwere many spots on the petticoat of the prosecutrix which she\nhad sealed and given to the Woman Constable alongwith vaginal\nslides. She has further deposed that no definite opinion about\nrape could have been given on the basis of the evidence. In\ncross-examination, she admitted that there were no sign of any\nprotest on the body of the prosecutrix.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">10.   Woman Constable Prabhawati (PW-8) has admitted\nreceiving sealed packet of petticoat and slides for which\nPanchnama (Ex.P/4) was prepared, but IO of the case G.L.\nParihar (PW-7) has nowhere deposed that as to what report was\nreceived in regard to such petticoat and such slides which were\nreceived from the doctor and whether they were sent for FSL\nexamination or not. On such premises, learned counsel for the\nappellant prays for allowing this appeal by acquitting the\nappellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">11.   Learned Public Prosecutor for the State on the other hand\nsubmits that in rural areas such minor omissions cannot be\nexaggerated to record a finding of acquittal in favour of the\naccused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">12.   Learned Public Prosecutor further submits that in para 27\nof the impugned judgment reason for delay has been dealt with\nby the learned Additional Sessions Judge and it is mentioned that\nthere is no sufficient cross-examination either on G.L.Parihar\n(PW-7) or on the prosecutrix (PW-1) who have categorically\nmentioned that FIR could be lodged with delay because of night\nand the fact that they were required to walk upto the police\nStation. It is further submitted that in the aforesaid backdrop, it is\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">                -( 6 )-                Criminal Appeal No.26/2006\n\nnot such a case where accused be acquitted because of certain\nminor    omissions       and   contradictions   in   the   testimony of\nprosecution witnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">13.     As far as FIR (Ex.P/1) is concerned, distance of police\nStation is mentioned as 8 kms. The hypothesis put forth by Lalu\n(PW-4) that they were confronted by the accused is not supported\nby any other witness, even there is no mention of such threat in\nthe FIR as has mentioned by Lalu (PW-4). Travelling a distance\nof 8 kms will not take 13 hours for the prosecutrix and her\nrelatives.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">14.     There is no independent witnesses though Suman (PW-3)\nhas admitted that there are two persons living in the immediate\nneighbourhood. There is no testimony of Sarpanch to whom Lalu\n(PW-4) says that they had visited before lodging of the FIR. Now,\nin view of such facts, when there is no independent witnesses,\ntestimony of each of the witnesses is to be examined and\nanalyzed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">15.     As far as Lalu (PW-4) is concerned, his testimony does not\ninspire any confidence. He cannot be said to be a witness at the\ntime of the incident because he has given a version that he had\nseen his wife naked being raped by the accused which is contrary\nto the version given by the prosecutrix (PW-1), Bhaggo (PW-2)\nand Suman (PW-3), who was the first to hear the cries of the\nprosecutrix, therefore, evidence of Lalu (PW-4) is not of much use\nto uphold the conviction of the accused, and hence, it needs to be\nbrushed aside.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">16.     As far as Bhaggo (PW-2) is concerned, there is material\ncontradiction in her statement. She states that when she arrived\nat the scene of incident she saw her son lying in a semi conscious\nstate and she offered water to him and he narrated that accused\nPansingh tried to throttle him as a result of which he fell down,\nwhereas Lalu (PW-4) has mentioned that he had seen the\naccused in the light of Chimni which was lit by his mother\nBhaggo, therefore, presence of Lalu at the place of incident at\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">               -( 7 )-               Criminal Appeal No.26/2006\n\nthat very point of time becomes doubtful. It is doubtful that he had\nseen the accused as Bhaggo says that she had arrived on the\nscene after accused had run away, then Lalu could not have seen\nhim in the light of Chimni lit by Bhaggo. Further her testimony to\nthe effect that earlier also certain persons were implicated in the\ncase of rape and matter was compromised, reveals that no\nwoman worth her salt will compromise her chastity and make\nsuch accusation and compromise the matter when such serious\noffence is committed not only against her body but also having\nserious ramifications of psychological and social dimensions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">17.   Suman (PW-3) has admitted that when she opened door of\nher room on hearing cries of her sister-in-law, she saw Lalu (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">4) fighting with the accused Pansingh. Therefore, version of the\nprosecutrix that Suman had called her husband and mother-in-\nlaw gets diluted inasmuch as Suman has also admitted that she\nhad never called her brother-in-law and her brother-in-law Lalu\nwas already present at the scene of incident. Further, Suman has\ndeposed that prosecutrix had only informed that she has been\ninsulted. This fact has been reiterated in her cross-examination\nand she had narrated the same version to the police that her\nsister-in-law was insulted by accused Pansingh. There is a\ndifference between insult and rape and if insult would have been\ncommitted, it would be a case under <a href=\"/doc/594493/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 294</a> of IPC and if it\nwould have been a case of physical insult, then it would be a case\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 323</a> of IPC but by no stretch of imagination it would\nhave been a case under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 376</a> of IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">18.   Dr. Anita Bhilwar (PW-9) has not supported the prosecution\ncase by giving any independent finding. Though the learned\nAdditional Sessions Judge has placed reliance on the judgment\nof this High Court in the case of Ram Vilas vs. State of M.P. as\nreported in 2004(2) M.P.H.T. 135 wherein it is held that even if a\nprosecutrix, who was a major, married woman and accustomed to\nsexual intercourse, dose not sustain any injury on her private part,\nit cannot be said that either story of the prosecutrix is false or she\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">              -( 8 )-              Criminal Appeal No.26/2006\n\nwas a consenting party. This judgment is to be seen in the light of\nthe testimony of prosecution witnesses. Lalu (PW-4) has\nmentioned that his wife, the prosecutrix, had sustained injuries on\nface, however, the doctor does not corroborate any of the injuries\nas mentioned by Lalu. It is also true that prosecutrix, who is a\ngrown up married woman and mother of three children, may not\nhave sustained any injury on the private part when she was being\nraped, but at the same time, there would have been some protest\nmarks on the other parts of her body and the story of the\nprosecution witness Lalu would have been corroborated either by\nthe prosecutrix or by the independent medical evidence. In\nabsence of there being any sign of protest, as mentioned by Dr.\nAnita Bhilwar (PW-9) this judgment in the case of Ram Vilas\n(supra) is distinguishable on facts and is not applicable in the\nfacts and circumstances of the present case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">19.   In view of such analysis of the evidence, it is apparent that\nit is a case of political rivalry and the accused who was a\nopponent to the mother-in-law of the prosecutrix has been framed\nin a case of rape by falsely accusing the appellant and also there\nis no justification for not getting the FSL report on the basis of\nsealed petticoat and the vaginal slides which were given by Dr.\nAnita Bhilwar (PW-9) to Woman Constable Prabhawati (PW-8) for\nwhich Panchnama Ex.P/4 was prepared. In absence of even any\nindependent scientific evidence to point out that any rape was\ncommitted, which would have been the best piece of evidence for\nthe prosecution, but prosecution has failed to produce such\nevidence, specially when there was no independent eye-witness,\nthe case of the prosecution does not appear to be standing on the\nfoundation of truth but appears to be a case of vindictive false\naccusation. Thus, appellant deserves to be acquitted and is\nacquitted. He will be free to claim compensation from the\nprosecution as well as State for such false accusation by\nundertaking independent proceedings. This appeal is accordingly\nallowed with cost which is quantified at Rs.10,000/- to be borne\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">                                 -( 9 )-              Criminal Appeal No.26/2006\n\n                  by the State and which will be payable to the appellant.
