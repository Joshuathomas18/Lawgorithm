This judgment will dispose of Criminal Appeal Nos. 716-717 of 2008,\n\nCriminal Appeal Nos. 119-122 of 2009, Criminal Appeal No. 833 of 2008\n\nand Criminal Appeal No. 1907 of 2009. All these appeals are against the\n\ncommon judgment passed by the High Court, whereby the appeals filed by\n\nthe appellants herein came to be dismissed.     Initially, as many as 10\n\naccused persons came to be tried for the offences punishable under\n\nSections 147, 148, 302, 302 read with Section 34 as also read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 109</a> and <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_2\">149</a> of the Indian Penal Code (&quot;<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">IPC</a>&quot; for short\n\nhereinafter) and <a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 27</a> of the Arms Act. The prosecution alleged that\n\non the fateful day, i.e. 5.7.1973, at about 7 a.m., the accused persons\n\nformed an unlawful assembly and committed the murder of one Shambhu\n\nNath Singh and his brother Prabhu Nath Singh, both deceased persons, in\n\npursuance of their common object. The First Information Report (FIR) was\n\nlodged by one Baijnath Singh and it was alleged therein that one Thakur\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                    3</span>\n\n\nOjha (A-4), Patiram Ojha (now dead), Akhilesh Ojha (A-5), Jitendra Singh\n\n(A-6), Raj Nath Singh (A-7), Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3), Keshav Singh (A-9),\n\nBachcha Singh (A-8), Adalat Pandit (A-10), Thakur Singh (A-1) and Ram\n\nPravesh Singh (A-2) went to his Mango orchard standing on Plot No. 4905,\n\nsituated in Mauza - Mohammadpur, P.S. Gorkha, Distt. Saran, which was\n\nsituated at a distance of about three furlong from village for forcibly\n\nplucking mango fruits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">2.    It was further stated by Baijnath Singh that he alongwith his two\n\nsons namely Shambhu Nath Singh and Prabhu Nath Singh went to his\n\norchard and protested against the act of the accused persons in plucking\n\nthe mangoes.     It was stated that Pati Ram Ojha (the dead accused)\n\nordered Thakur Ojha (A-4) to attack on those three persons, on which\n\nThakur Ojha (A-4) fired two shots aiming at Shambhu Nath Singh, who\n\nwas injured due to fire and tried to run away towards his house, but fell on\n\nthe ground at some distance in the nearby orchard of one Arjun Singh. It\n\nwas then contended that Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) went after him and gave\n\nspear blow on the back of Shambhu Nath Singh while Shambhu Nath\n\nSingh was still lying on the ground. In the meantime, Thakur Ojha (A-4)\n\nagain fired two shots on the elder son of Baijnath namely Prabhu Nath\n\nSingh, who also fell on the ground in the orchard of Arjun Singh. After he\n\nfell down, Raj Nath Singh (A-7), Bachcha Singh (A-8) and Adalat Pandit\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                      4</span>\n\n\n(A-10) rushed to Prabhu Nath Singh and indiscriminately assaulted him by\n\nmeans of spear and his body was dragged by Raj Nath Singh (A-7) and\n\nRam Pravesh Singh (A-2). It was further stated in the FIR that on seeing\n\nthis, Baijnath Singh asked himself to be killed; however, Patiram Ojha\n\n(dead accused) said that it was useless to cause the death of an old\n\nperson like him and that he should better be left to flee. It was suggested\n\nthat one Laxman Singh (PW-8), Arjun Singh, Bhrigunath Singh (PW-7),\n\nRam Prasad Singh (PW-4) and others were present on the spot and had\n\nseen the entire incident. There was a fierce enmity between the two sides\n\nthough they were related to each other, on account of ownership and\n\npossession of the said orchard and a civil dispute was pending in the Court\n\nof 3rd Additional District Judge, Saran.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">3.       The FIR was recorded by A.S.I. Abdul Malik of Garkha Police Station\n\nand the investigation ensued. The Investigating Officer arrested the dead\n\naccused Patiram Ojha, Thakur Ojha (A-4), Jitendra Singh (A-6), Raj Nath\n\nSingh (A-7), Keshav Singh (A-9), Bachcha Singh (A-8), Thakur Singh (A-1)\n\nand Ram Pravesh Singh (A-2) from the house of Raj Nath Singh (A-7).\n\nThe Investigating Officer effected the search of the house and recovered a\n\ndouble barrel gun kept on the cot under the bed. Two spears were also\n\nrecovered during the investigation, the blades of which were stained with\n\nblood.     The seizures were effected and arrests were made.         In the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                    5</span>\n\n\nmeantime, one Shantruhan Singh (PW-15), the Officer-in-charge, Garkha\n\nPolice Station reached the spot and took charge of the investigation from\n\nA.S.I. Abdul Malik.   He carried out the further investigation; effected\n\nSeizure Memo and Spot Panchnama etc. and recorded the statement of\n\nthe witnesses. On 21.9.1974, he made over the charge of investigation to\n\none S.D. Ghos, who made over the investigation to one Madhav Kant and\n\nit was Madhav Kant who submitted the chargesheet against, in all, 11\n\naccused persons (including the dead accused Patiram Ojha).            The\n\naccused persons were committed to Sessions Court. The Sessions Court\n\nframed the charges.    The accused having abjured the guilt, the trial\n\nproceeded and after the trial was over, the accused persons came to be\n\nconvicted for the various offences i.e. offences punishable under Sections\n\n147, 148, 302, 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/968081/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 34</a> as also read with <a href=\"/doc/513074/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 109</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_7\">149</a> IPC and <a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 27</a> of the Arms Act. Patiram Ojha (the dead\n\naccused) was not convicted as he died during the trial itself. Out of all\n\nthese accused persons, Thakur Singh (A-1) and Ram Pravesh Singh (A-2)\n\nwere held guilty by the Sessions Court for the offence punishable under\n\nSection 147 while the remaining 8 accused persons were held guilty under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 148</a> IPC. Thakur Ojha (A-4) and Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) were\n\nconvicted for the substantive offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 302</a> IPC for committing\n\nthe murder of Shambhu Nath Singh while Thakur Ojha (A-4), Raj Nath\n\nSingh (A-7), Bachcha Singh (A-8) and Adalat Pandit (A-10) were convicted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                    6</span>\n\n\nfor the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 302</a> IPC for causing the death of\n\nPrabhu Nath Singh. The remaining 5 accused persons namely Akhilesh\n\nOjha (A-5), Jitendra Singh (A-6), Keshav Singh (A-9), Ram Pravesh Singh\n\n(A-2) and Thakur Singh (A-1) were booked under Section 302 read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 149</a> IPC. Separate appeals were filed by these accused persons\n\nbefore the High Court. While the appeals of the other accused persons\n\nwere dismissed, the appeal filed on behalf of Bachcha Singh (A-8) was\n\nallowed, giving him the benefit of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_13\">Juvenile Justice Act</a>.\n\nThe other appeals were dismissed and that is how 9 accused persons\n\nhave come up before us in the present appeals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">4.    It is significant to note that Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) had raised a\n\nplea of alibi and examined as many as 11 defence witnesses in support of\n\nthat plea. That plea was of course rejected by the Trial Court. There were\n\nsome defence witnesses examined on behalf of Adalat Pandit (A-10) also,\n\nraising the plea of alibi even in his case. But even that contention was\n\nrejected by the Trial Court. The other accused persons had merely made\n\na plea of denial and their defence was also rejected. The High Court has\n\ntaken stock of evidence of all the witnesses in great details. In fact, the\n\nevidence of practically each witness of the prosecution as well as the\n\ndefence was examined.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                     7</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">5.    Shri Nagendra Rai, Learned Senior Counsel has appeared for the\n\nappellants Thakur Singh (A-1), Ram Pravesh Singh (A-2), Akhilesh Ojha\n\n(A-5), Jitendra Singh (A-6) and Keshav Singh (A-9) in Criminal Appeal\n\nNos. 119-122 of 2009 and addressed on various aspects of the matter.\n\nSimilarly, Shri S.B. Sanyal, Learned Senior Counsel has appeared for the\n\nappellant Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) in Criminal Appeal No. 833 of 2008 and\n\naddressed on various aspects, while Shri M.P. Jha, Shri Ram Ekbal Roy,\n\nShri Harshvardhan Jha and Shri Bhattacharjee, Learned Counsel (acted\n\nas Amicus Curiae) addressed on behalf of other appellants/accused\n\npersons, namely Thakur Ojha (A-4), Raj Nath Singh (A-7) and Adalat\n\nPandit (A-10).   Ms. Kumud Lata Das and Shri Gopal Singh, Learned\n\nCounsel have appeared for the State in all the cases and supported the\n\nconviction of the accused persons. We will, therefore, consider the matter\n\nas per the appeals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">6.    Shri Nagendra Rai, learned Senior Counsel, who represented the\n\nappellants Thakur Singh (A-1), Ram Pravesh Singh (A-2), Akhilesh Ojha\n\n(A-5), Jitendra Singh (A-6) and Keshav Singh (A-9) in Criminal Appeal\n\nNos. 119-122 of 2009, addressed firstly on behalf of Thakur Singh (A-1),\n\nAkhilesh Ojha (A-5) and Keshav Singh (A-9). The learned Senior Counsel\n\nwas at pains to point out that no witness has attributed any overt act to any\n\nof these accused persons and that they were mere mute bystanders. Shri\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                    8</span>\n\n\nRai invited our attention to the evidence of the eye-witnesses, they being\n\nSukeshwar Singh (PW-2), Ram Prasad Singh (PW-4), Badrinath Singh\n\n(PW-5), Bhrigunath Singh (PW-7) and Laxman Singh (PW-8). He was at\n\npains to point out that the High Court has specifically referred to each of\n\nthese witnesses individually considering their evidence who were almost\n\nunanimous that they saw eleven accused persons when they came to the\n\norchard of the informant (Baijnath Singh).     The witnesses stated that\n\nBaijnath Singh alongwith his two sons Shambhu Nath Singh and Prabhu\n\nNath Singh had come a little later in the said orchard and the accused\n\npersons who wanted to pluck the mangoes, were stopped from doing so by\n\nBaijnath and in that the exchange of hot words took place. The witnesses\n\nclaimed that thereafter, on the orders of Patiram Ojha (the dead accused),\n\nThakur Ojha (A-4) fired two shots with his gun hitting Shambunath Singh\n\nwho ran towards the West and fell down in the orchard of Arjun Singh.\n\nThereafter, he was assaulted by Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) on the back with\n\na spear. When Prabhu Nath Singh ran towards Shambhu Nath Singh,\n\nThakur Ojha (A-4) again fired two shots on Prabhu Nath Singh and he also\n\nfell down in the orchard of Arjun Singh, whereafter, he was assaulted by\n\nRaj Nath Singh (A-7), Bachcha Singh (A-8) and Adalat Pandit (A-10). It is\n\nto be seen that beyond this version, nothing more has come in the\n\nevidence. It is further to be seen that the witnesses Ram Prasad Singh\n\n(PW-4), Badrinath Singh (PW-5), Bhrigunath Singh (PW-7) and Laxman\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                    9</span>\n\n\nSingh (PW-8) had seen the occurrence.        The witnesses then saw the\n\naccused persons running away from the spot towards the house of Raj\n\nNath Singh (A-7). Almost same story was repeated by Ram Prasad Singh\n\n(PW-4) who claimed that he was present, as he had to cut bamboos from\n\nthe place which was near the orchard of the informant Baijnath Singh. He\n\nalso admitted about the litigation between the parties. There was omission\n\nabout Thakur Ojha (A-4) having ordered for dragging the dead body to the\n\norchard of the informant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">7.    Badrinath Singh (PW-5) also claimed that he had accompanied Ram\n\nPrasad Singh (PW-4) for cutting bamboos and he has also given almost\n\nthe same version. Bhrigunath Singh (PW-7) and Laxman Singh (PW-8)\n\nalso have repeated the same story but without attributing any overt act to\n\nthe aforementioned three accused persons, namely, Thakur Singh (A-1),\n\nAkhilesh Ojha (A-5) and Keshav Singh (A-9).         After appreciating the\n\nevidence of these witnesses, the High Court recorded a finding in Para 20\n\nof its judgment that the genesis of the incident lied only in the fact that\n\nwhen the accused persons insisted on plucking the mangoes, the same\n\nwas objected to by the complainant and his sons.          The High Court,\n\nundoubtedly, is correct in recording the finding that it is on that point of\n\ntime when the exchange of words took place between the parties that the\n\nseeds of the further incident were sown.       Ultimately, the High Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                    1</span>\n\n\nrecorded the finding that the identity of the accused persons was fully\n\nestablished by the prosecution witnesses and that all the appellants had\n\ngone to the place of occurrence alongwith their respective arms as\n\nmembers of an unlawful assembly with a common object of asserting right\n\nof harvesting the mango crops in the orchard of the informant and were\n\nprepared for meeting any resistance with the help of arms carried by the\n\naccused persons and that was the common object behind the firing on the\n\ntwo deceased, who met their instantaneous death. It was on this basis\n\nthat the High Court proceeded to convict the accused persons against\n\nwhom there was specific evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">8.    In our opinion, at least insofar as the aforementioned three accused\n\npersons, namely Thakur Singh (A-1), Akhilesh Ojha (A-5) and Keshav\n\nSingh (A-9) are concerned, it cannot be said that they had the intentions to\n\ncommit the murder and they cannot be said to be the members of the\n\nunlawful assembly on account of their mere presence at the place of\n\noccurrence and cannot be convicted of the offence under Section 302 read\n\nwith <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 149</a> IPC.      We have closely seen the evidence of the\n\nwitnesses. These three accused persons were undoubtedly referred to\n\nand all that has been stated by Sukeshwar Singh (PW-2) is that Akhilesh\n\nOjha (A-5) was carrying a lathi. The witness has not referred to even\n\nThakur Singh (A-1) and Keshav Singh (A-9) having any arms. As regards\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                   1</span>\n\n\nRam Prasad Singh (PW-4), he has attributed Thakur Singh (A-1) and\n\nAkhilesh Ojha (A-5) carrying a lathi while Keshav Singh (A-9) carrying a\n\nbhala (spear). However, he has not referred to any overt act on part of\n\nthese accused persons or use of the same by them. Badrinath Singh (PW-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">5) has mentioned about Thakur Singh (A-1) and Ram Pravesh Singh (A-2)\n\nhaving lathi. He has made a general statement that all other accused\n\npersons were holding a bhala. However, this witness also has not referred\n\nto any overt act on the part of the above accused persons, namely Thakur\n\nSingh (A-1), Akhilesh Ojha (A-5) and Keshav Singh (A-9). As regards\n\nRam Lakhan Singh (PW-6), he has turned hostile. Bhrigunath Singh (PW-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">7) has also stated that these three accused persons were carrying lathi.\n\nThe story is no different in respect of Laxman Singh (PW-8). His evidence\n\nis extremely general. Some of the witnesses have also not referred to the\n\nexhortation given by Patiram Ojha (the dead accused). At least insofar as\n\nthe present accused persons are concerned, the role played by these\n\nthree accused persons, namely Thakur Singh (A-1), Akhilesh Ojha (A-5)\n\nand Keshav Singh (A-9) appears to be that of the bystanders. There was\n\na dispute between the parties on account of the possession of the field.\n\nEven the Court litigation was on between the parties. Therefore, merely\n\nbecause the accused persons went to the field carrying lathis and arms, at\n\nleast till such time when the exchange of words started and the shot was\n\nfired, it cannot be said that the whole assembly had become unlawful. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                    1</span>\n\n\nassembly would become unlawful when Patiram Ojha (the dead accused)\n\nallegedly gave the firing orders to Thakur Ojha (A-4) and who in pursuance\n\nof that, fired on Shambhu Nath Singh. Undoubtedly, these three accused\n\npersons [Thakur Singh (A-1), Akhilesh Ojha (A-5) and Keshav Singh (A-9)]\n\nacted as mere mute bystanders, as there is no evidence also that they\n\ntook part in the exchange of words. Under such circumstances, it would\n\nbe difficult to attribute a common object to these accused persons on\n\naccount of their presence even if they were armed with lathis. There is no\n\nevidence about Akhilesh Ojha (A-5) carrying a spear.         Under such\n\ncircumstances, benefit of doubt must go to these three accused persons.\n\nThey would be entitled to acquittal as the prosecution has failed to prove\n\nthat they had a common intention to commit murder.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">9.    Insofar as the rest of the accused persons are concerned, Shri\n\nNagendra Rai, learned Senior Counsel insisted that admittedly Ram\n\nPravesh Singh (A-2) and Jitendra Singh (A-6) had only dragged the body\n\nof Prabhu Nath Singh.      That would certainly amount to the active\n\nparticipation of these two accused persons. Their continuance even after\n\nthe firing in doing overt act of dragging the body from the field would\n\ncertainly make them the part of the unlawful assembly, which had the\n\ncommon object of eliminating Shambhu Nath Singh and Prabhu Nath\n\nSingh. The part played by these two accused persons of dragging the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                    1</span>\n\n\nbody of Prabhu Nath Singh is clearly referred to by the witnesses. We,\n\ntherefore, reject the contention raised by Shri Rai, learned Senior Counsel\n\nthat these two accused persons would also be entitled to be acquitted for\n\nthe same reasons as we have acquitted Thakur Singh (A-1), Akhilesh Ojha\n\n(A-5) and Keshav Singh (A-9) for. The appeals of these two accused\n\npersons would be liable to be dismissed as we are satisfied on the point\n\nthat they were the members of the unlawful assembly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">10.   Similar is the case as regards Thakur Ojha (A-4) who had actually\n\nfired the guns, Raj Nath Singh (A-7) and Adalat Pandit (A-10).         The\n\nevidence is against them as accepted by both the Courts below. They\n\nwere certainly the members of the unlawful assembly and specific overt\n\nacts have been attributed to them by almost all the witnesses. As regards\n\nThakur Ojha (A-4), all the witnesses are unanimous that he was the one\n\nwho had fired. His appeal will, therefore, have to be dismissed.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">11.   Insofar as Raj Nath Singh (A-7) and Adalat Pandit (A-10) are\n\nconcerned, they took active part in assaulting Prabhu Nath Singh while the\n\nbody of Prabhu Nath Singh was dragged by Ram Pravesh Singh (A-2) and\n\nJitendra Singh (A-6). The witnesses have specifically attributed the overt\n\nacts regarding assaulting of Prabhu Nath Singh to these accused persons.\n\nWe are satisfied with the evidence led on behalf of the prosecution in\n\nrespect of these accused persons, which has been accepted by both the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                    1</span>\n\n\nCourts below and we have no reason to disbelieve the witnesses who\n\nhave attributed specific overt acts as regards the assault on Prabhu Nath\n\nSingh to these accused persons.         Insofar as Adalat Pandit (A-10) is\n\nconcerned, the plea was that of alibi, which plea has been rejected by the\n\nTrial Court and the High Court. Very heavy reliance was placed on the\n\nevidence of Rajiv Ranjan Shrivastava (DW-20), Praduman Dubey (DW-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">21), A.B. Prasad (DW-22), Col. Pritam Singh (DW-25) and Col. Amrik\n\nSingh (DW-26) for his alibi.   Rajiv Ranjan Shrivastava (DW-20) was a\n\nhandwriting expert for proving the signatures of Adalat Pandit (A-10) over\n\nthe postal receipt Exhibit-6. His evidence has rightly been disbelieved on\n\nthe ground that he had prepared his report on the previous evening after\n\ntaking fees. Praduman Dubey (DW-21) was a Head Clerk in the Sainik\n\nOffice, Danapur and he proved the leave register of Adalat Pandit (A-10)\n\nas Exhibit O. A.B. Prasad (DW-22) was also an employee in the Pay &amp;\n\nAccounts Office, Sainik Office, Danapur.      He proved the pay book of\n\nAdalat Pandit (A-10) as Exhibit P and his acquittance roll as Exhibit Q. It\n\nwas suggested that Adalat Pandit (A-10) was on leave from 11.6.1973 till\n\n2.7.1973 and that he received the payment on 26.5.1973 as also on\n\n3.7.1973. The High Court has disbelieved this evidence on the ground that\n\nthe document did not show the date 3.7.1973. Col. Pritam Singh (DW-25)\n\nwas a commanding officer of 10, Bihar Regiment at the relevant time and\n\nhe had admitted that he had no personal knowledge regarding actual\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                    1</span>\n\n\npresence of Adalat Pandit (A-10) on the said date. Similarly, Col. Amrik\n\nSingh (DW-26) had claimed that by an order dated 26.1.1973, the leave of\n\nAdalat Pandit (A-10) was extended for 14 days from 6.4.1973 to 19.4.1973\n\nbecause Adalat Pandit (A-10) did not resume his duty on 6.4.1973. The\n\nHigh Court has rejected his evidence and for good reasons. The assertion\n\nof Col. Amrik Singh (DW-26) that Adalat Pandit (A-10) was present in the\n\nunit on 3.7.1973 was only on the basis of Exhibits P and Q being the pay\n\nbook and acquittance roll of Adalat Pandit (A-10) respectively. Exhibits P\n\nand Q have rightly been disbelieved by the High Court giving good\n\nreasons.   The High Court has rightly held that Exhibits P and Q were\n\ncasually maintained by the Havildar and a poor attempt had been made to\n\nshow that Adalat Pandit (A-10) had reported for duty on 3.7.1973. We are\n\nconvinced that the plea of alibi by Adalat Pandit (A-10) cannot be accepted\n\nand has to be disbelieved as has been done by the Trial Court and the\n\nappellate Court.   We would accept the evidence of the prosecution\n\nwitnesses, more particularly the eye-witnesses, who had specifically\n\nattributed an active role to this accused person. The appeals of Raj Nath\n\nSingh (A-7) and Adalat Pandit (A-10) will, therefore, have to be dismissed\n\nholding that they were members of the unlawful assembly. We, therefore,\n\nconfirm the judgments of the Trial Court and the appellate Court convicting\n\nRaj Nath Singh (A-7) and Adalat Pandit (A-10) with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 149</a>\n\nIPC.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                     1</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">12.   That leaves us with the case of Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3). It must be\n\nappreciated that Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) has been mentioned practically\n\nby all the witnesses.    All the eye-witnesses have also referred to the\n\nspecific overt act of this accused of following Shambhu and hitting him with\n\nspear on his back.      Sukeshwar Singh (PW-2) is very specific in his\n\nevidence insofar as the said act of the accused was concerned. Some\n\ncross-examination was directed to suggest that Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3)\n\nwould have no reason or motive to take part in the assault. However, the\n\nmain claim in the evidence of this witness regarding the overt act remained\n\nunshaken. Similar is the story of Ram Prasad Singh (PW-4). The cross-\n\nexamination of Ram Prasad Singh (PW-4) is also of no consequence\n\ninsofar as the main incident is concerned. Badrinath Singh (PW-5) also\n\nrepeated the same story without any substantial challenge to this version\n\nin the cross-examination.     A typical suggestion was given to all the\n\nwitnesses as if Gorakh Nath Singh had issued a warrant for lagan (tax) on\n\nthese witnesses. Bhrigunath Singh (PW-7) also repeated the same story\n\nand there is very little or no cross-examination on the main incident. In the\n\ncross-examination of this witness itself, the same stereotyped suggestion\n\nwas given that Gorakh Nath had issued a lagaan against the father of this\n\nwitness, thereby suggesting an enmity. Laxman Singh (PW-8) is the only\n\nexception, who though referred to the presence of this accused duly\n\narmed, has not referred to the overt act of this accused of piercing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                    1</span>\n\n\nShambhu with a spear.       We will not attach much importance to the\n\nevidence of this witness in view of the evidence of the other eye-witnesses.\n\nIt is again to be seen that the evidence of the eye-witnesses in respect of\n\nthe spear injuries on Shambhu Nath Singh and Prabhu Nath Singh is\n\nfurther corroborated by the medical evidence inasmuch as both Shambhu\n\nNath Singh and Prabhu Nath Singh had suffered penetrating wounds and\n\nincised wounds in addition to the wounds caused by pellets. The Post\n\nMortem Report was prepared by Dr. B.M. Srivastava (dead) as proved by\n\nDr. J.C. Brahmo, who has proved all the injuries which are to be found in\n\nthe Post Mortem Report (Exhibits 5 and 5/1). Therefore, there is very little\n\nscope for the argument that Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) was not a part of the\n\nunlawful assembly and had not caused the wound to Shambhu Nath Singh\n\nwith spear after he was fired at.       The argument of Shri S.B. Sanyal,\n\nLearned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of the appellant/accused\n\nGorakh Nath Singh (A-3) that this accused was not concerned and has\n\nbeen falsely implicated, cannot, therefore, be accepted. Finding this, the\n\nlearned Senior Counsel heavily relied on the evidence of defence\n\nwitnesses, who were examined in support of the plea of alibi of this\n\naccused as also the evidence of Sultan Ahmad (PW-14).\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">13.   Sultan Ahmad (PW-14) was a Block Development Officer (BDO) of\n\nthe said area. He deposed that Gorakh Nath Singh was a Gram Sewak in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f                                    1</span>\n\n\nhis block and was working in Devariya Panchpariya village Panchayat.\n\nRegarding the fateful day, the witness deposed that he went on that day to\n\nDevariya to collect levy of wheat crops and reached Devariya at about 1 o&#x27;\n\nclock in the afternoon. He stated that Gorakh Nath Singh reached after\n\nhalf an hour later when he reached there. He also suggested that there\n\nwas a Special Planning for levying wheat in those days.       The witness\n\nsuggested that one Umashankar was Block Agriculture Officer and he\n\nalongwith Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) and other witnesses like one Kuldeep\n\nSingh, Karamchari (DW-8), Ram Sewak, Jan Sewak and Mukhiya and\n\nSarpanch of the Panchyat (DW-7) were levying wheat at that time. Shri\n\nSanyal, learned Senior Counsel, while trying to taking advantage of the\n\nevidence of this witness, also asserted that his claim that Gorakh Nath\n\nSingh (A-3) reached there at about 1 o&#x27; clock, was not correct.        The\n\nlearned Senior Counsel relied on an omission in that behalf. The learned\n\nSenior Counsel also heavily relied on the evidence of Kapil Narayan Sinha\n\n(DW-1), a Deputy Superintendent of Police, who proved the carbon copy of\n\na report which he had prepared in pursuance of the orders passed by the\n\nSuperintendent of Police. This was on account of an application having\n\nbeen made by Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3), claiming that he was in fact not\n\npresent at the spot and was busy in the activity of wheat levy in the other\n\nvillage. The witness also proved the application of Gorakh Nath Singh at\n\nExhibit C. It is to be seen that he had to admit that even after preparing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                    1</span>\n\n\nthe said so-called report, the Superintendent of Police had ordered to file\n\nthe chargesheet against Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">14.   The other witness relied on by the learned Senior Counsel was\n\nKailash Singh (DW-2), who deposed that the levy was being collected from\n\n6 o&#x27; clock in the morning at the door of Mukhiya Ram Barai Singh and the\n\npayment of the levied wheat was being paid after taking its weight there.\n\nAccording to him, other witness namely Ram Sewak Roy was weighing the\n\nwheat. According to him, the weight of his wheat was also taken and the\n\nreceipt for that was written and signed by Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) and the\n\npayment was also made to him after obtaining his signatures on the\n\nreceipt.   He produced Exhibit D being a receipt written and signed by\n\nGorakh Nath Singh (A-3) on that day. In his cross-examination, however,\n\nhe was unable to show any notice having been given by BDO to him and\n\nhad to admit that BDO had never asked for levy to him. Similar was the\n\nevidence of Munshilal Roy (DW-3), who spoke about his reaching the spot\n\nat about 6 o&#x27; clock in the morning to the house of Ram Barai, Mukhiya with\n\nwheat of levy. He also spoke that Ram Sewak Roy was weighing the\n\nwheat and Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) was writing on the receipts (Exhibit D-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">1) for that. He could not produce the notice which was allegedly given to\n\nhim by the Department for levy. He did not even know how much levy\n\nwheat was required to be given by him. The witness also could not show\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">\f                                    2</span>\n\n\nanything to suggest that the levy was being collected from a particular\n\nhouse. He frankly admitted that he never met BDO.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">15.     To the same effect was the evidence of Ram Pravesh Singh (DW-4),\n\nwho generally spoke about the levy activity and asserted that it was\n\nGorakh Nath Singh (A-3) who was writing the receipts and was distributing\n\nthe amounts on that day and that the levy work was started at 6 o&#x27; clock in\n\nthe morning and Gorakh Nath Singh was with the Group of levy since that\n\ntime.   Similar was the evidence of Fulkan Manjhi (DW-5), who was a\n\nChowkidar at Madhupur, P.S. Gorkha, District Saran. He also spoke about\n\nthe said activity of levy and the fact that Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) was\n\npresent writing the receipt and paying money to the farmers. Ram Barai\n\nSingh (DW-7) was Mukhiya of Devariya, Panchpariya Gram Pranchayat,\n\nwho asserted that it was at his door that the special levy collection was\n\ngoing on, which exercise started at 6 o&#x27; clock in the morning. The witness\n\nfurther asserted that Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) was paying the cost of levy\n\nwheat after making receipts of that and he had done this work from 6 o&#x27;\n\nclock in the morning to 11 o&#x27; clock in day time on that day. The witness,\n\nhowever, could not produce any documentary evidence to show that the\n\nlevy work was done at his place. The evidence of Kuldeep Narayan Singh\n\n(DW-8) was to the same effect. He was a Karamchari and said that there\n\nwas a levy going on on 5.7.1973. He also suggested that Gorakh Nath\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">\f                                     2</span>\n\n\nSingh (A-3) was present for the levy and was continuously working from 6\n\no&#x27; clock in the morning till 12 o&#x27; clock in the day time on that day. The\n\nevidence of Ram Lal Manjhi (DW-9) was to the same effect, so also the\n\nevidence of the landlord of Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3), namely Vidya\n\nNarayan Singh, who as DW-10 claimed that Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) had\n\ntaken room in his house and had gone for the levy work at 5.45 a.m. The\n\nevidence of Adya Narayan Singh (DW-11), who was a Panchayat Sewak\n\nin the Gorkha Block, was also to the same effect. He proved a document\n\nas Exhibit DF, which was a carbon copy of the slip (receipt), as also\n\nExhibits 3/2 and 3/3 being the registers bearing the signatures of Gorakh\n\nNath Singh (A-3). Ram Nagina Singh (DW-16) and Sona Lal Sah (DW-17)\n\nalso asserted about the levy. Both the Courts had chosen to accept the\n\nevidence of the eye-witnesses and have rejected the evidence led on\n\nbehalf of the defence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">16.   It is to be noted that these witnesses were all interested witnesses in\n\nthe sense that they were the colleagues of Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3).\n\nBefore we venture to appreciate this evidence, it must be noted that the\n\ndistance between the spot where the incident took place and the place\n\nwhere the accused Gorakh Nath Singh claimed to have been present is\n\nextremely short. Admittedly, it is 3 or 4 kilometers. When all the witnesses\n\nclaimed that the work of levy began from 6 o&#x27; clock in the morning, it is a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                           2</span>\n\n\nvery difficult claim to be accepted.           In the first place, there is nothing\n\nproved by way of documentary evidence to show that the levy of wheat\n\nwas to be collected at the house of Ram Barai Singh, Mukhiya (DW-7) or\n\nthat the levy was proposed to be held at village Devariya Panchpariya on\n\nthat day. We cannot accept that there would be no documentary evidence,\n\nparticularly if it was an exercise of levy.          There is bound to be some\n\nrecords somewhere. We are not much impressed by the receipts, which\n\nhave been filed by the witnesses because there is nothing on those\n\nreceipts as to when they were actually prepared. In fact, the evidence of\n\nSultan Ahmad (PW-14) could not be demolished when he said that he had\n\nreached the place where the levy work was going on and it was at about 1\n\no&#x27; clock that Gorakh Nath Singh (A-3) arrived there alongwith others. The\n\nTrial Court thoroughly discussed this evidence and held it to be not\n\nreliable. In view of the very short distance of 4 kilometers between the two\n\nplaces i.e. the place of incident Mauza - Mohammadpur and the village\n\nDevariya Panchpariya, the evidence appears to be extremely doubtful. We\n\nare also not impressed by the evidence of Kapil Narayan Sinha (DW-1),\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Police, as nothing would turn open the so-called\n\nreport prepared by him in view of the direct evidence led by the\n\nprosecution. In our opinion, the Trial Court and the appellate Court were\n\nright in rejecting the defence of alibi.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\f                                    2</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">17.

This decision was relied upon to show that the\n\n             non-examination of the concerned medical officer would affect\n\n             the prosecution case. This was probably in order to show that\n\n             the original Doctor (Dr. B.M. Srivastava) who had done the\n\n             Post Mortem, had expired and the Post Mortem Report had to\n\n             be proved by another Doctor namely Dr. J.C. Brahmo. We do\n\n             not find anything wrong with the Report having been proved\n\n             by the other Doctor.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1239375\" id=\"span_22\">(<a href=\"/doc/1239375/\" id=\"a_16\">ii)   Maranadu &amp; Anr.

We have given the reasons for\n\n        acceptance of that evidence and also for the acquittal of three\n\n        accused persons, who could not be held to be the part of the\n\n        unlawful assembly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"662558\" id=\"span_25\">(iii)   Yunis alias <a href=\"/doc/662558/\" id=\"a_20\">Kariya Vs.
