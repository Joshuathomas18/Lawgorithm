In all the \ncases the allegation was that the concerned accused was either transporting or \nstoring black jaggery/molasses  for the purpose of manufacturing illicit distilled \nliquor or was an abettor so far as the offence of manufacturing illicit liquor is \nconcerned.  On being moved by application under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 482</a> of the Code of \nCriminal Procedure, 1973 ( in short the &quot;Code&quot;) by the concerned accused for \nquashing the FIR, the High Court accepted the plea holding that there was no \nmaterial to show that the seized articles were intended to be used for \nmanufacturing of illicit distilled liquor. Accordingly the FIR in each case was \nquashed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">\tIn support of the appeals, learned counsel appearing for the State of \nAndhra Pradesh submitted that the High Court&#x27;s approach is clearly erroneous. \nThese are not  cases where there was no material to show the commission of a \ncrime. Whether there was adequate material already in existence or which could \nhave been collected during investigation and their relevance is essentially a \nmatter of trial. The High Court was not therefore justified in quashing the FIR.  \nThe exercise of power under Section 482 of the Code is clearly indefensible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">\tPer contra, learned counsel for the concerned accused-respondents \nsubmitted that on mere surmises and conjectures that the black jaggery/molasses \nbeing transported or stored were intended to be used for the purpose of \nmanufacturing illicit distilled liquor, the FIR was lodged.   Suspicion however \nstrong cannot be a ground to initiate criminal proceedings thereby unnecessarily \nharassing the innocent traders/transporters. In some cases, it was pointed out that \nthere was absolutely no material to even show that the seized articles were \nintended for manufacturing illicit distilled liquor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">Exercise of power under Section 482 of the Code in a case of this nature is \nthe exception and not the rule.  The Section does not confer any new powers on \nthe High Court.  It only saves the inherent power which the Court possessed \nbefore the enactment of the Code.  It envisages three circumstances under which \nthe inherent jurisdiction may be exercised, namely, (i) to give effect to an order \nunder the Code, (ii) to prevent abuse of the process of court, and (iii) to otherwise \nsecure the ends of justice.  It is neither possible nor desirable to lay down any \ninflexible rule which would govern the exercise of inherent jurisdiction.  No \nlegislative enactment dealing with procedure can provide for all cases that may \npossibly arise.  Courts, therefore, have inherent powers apart from express \nprovisions of law which are necessary for proper discharge of functions and \nduties imposed upon them by law.  That is the doctrine which finds expression in \nthe Section which merely recognizes and preserves inherent powers of the High \nCourts.  All courts, whether civil or criminal possess, in the absence of any \nexpress provision, as inherent in their constitution, all such powers as are \nnecessary to do the right and to undo a wrong in course of administration of \njustice on the principle quando lex aliquid alique concedit, conceditur et id sine \nquo res ipsa esse non potest (when the law gives a person anything it gives him \nthat without which it cannot exist).  While exercising powers under the Section, \nthe Court does not function as a court of appeal or revision. Inherent jurisdiction \nunder the Section though wide has to be exercised sparingly, carefully and with \ncaution and only when such exercise is justified by the tests specifically laid \ndown in the Section itself.  It is to be exercised ex debito justitiae to do real and \nsubstantial justice for the administration of which alone courts exist.  Authority \nof the court exists for advancement of justice and if any attempt is made to abuse \nthat authority so as to produce injustice, the court has power to prevent such \nabuse.  It would be an abuse of process of the court to allow any action which \nwould result in injustice and prevent promotion of justice.  In exercises of the \npowers court would be justified to quash any proceeding if it finds that initiation \nor continuance of it amounts to abuse of the process of court or quashing of these \nproceedings would otherwise serve the ends of justice.  When no offence is \ndisclosed by the complaint, the court may examine the question of fact.  When a \ncomplaint is sought to be quashed, it is permissible to look into the materials to \nassess what the complainant has alleged and whether any offence is made out \neven if the allegations are accepted in toto.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1033301\" id=\"span_1\">In <a href=\"/doc/1033301/\" id=\"a_5\">R.P. Kapur v. State of Punjab</a> (AIR 1960 SC 866), this Court \nsummarized some categories of cases where inherent power can and should be \nexercised to quash the proceedings.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">(i)\twhere it manifestly appears that there is a legal bar \nagainst the institution or continuance e.g. want of \nsanction;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">(ii)\twhere the allegations in the first information report \nor complaint taken at its face value and accepted in \ntheir entirety do not constitute the offence alleged;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">(iii)    where the allegations constitute an offence, but there \nis no legal evidence adduced or the evidence \nadduced clearly or manifestly fails to prove the \ncharge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1033637\" id=\"span_2\">In dealing with the last category, it is important to bear in mind the \ndistinction between a case where there is no legal evidence or where there is \nevidence which is clearly inconsistent with the accusations made, and a case \nwhere there is legal evidence which, on appreciation, may or may not support the \naccusations.  When exercising jurisdiction under Section 482 of the Code, the \nHigh Court would not ordinarily embark upon an enquiry whether the evidence in \nquestion is reliable or not or whether on a reasonable appreciation of it accusation \nwould not be sustained.  That is the function of the trial Judge.  Judicial process \nno doubt should not be an instrument of oppression, or, needless harassment.  \nCourt should be circumspect and judicious in exercising discretion and should \ntake all relevant facts and circumstances into consideration before issuing \nprocess, lest it would be an instrument in the hands of a private complainant to \nunleash vendetta to harass any person needlessly.  At the same time the Section is \nnot an instrument handed over to an accused to short-circuit a prosecution and \nbring about its sudden death.  The scope of exercise of power under Section 482 \nof the Code and the categories of cases where the High Court may exercise its \npower under it relating to cognizable offences to prevent abuse of process of any \ncourt or otherwise to secure the ends of justice were set out in some detail by this \nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1033637/\" id=\"a_6\">State of Haryana v. Bhajan Lal</a> (1992 Supp (1) SCC 335) A note of \ncaution was, however, added that the power should be exercised sparingly and \nthat too in rarest of rare cases.  The illustrative categories indicated by this Court \nare as follows:</span> \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;(1)\tWhere the allegations made in the first information \nreport or the complaint, even if they are taken at their \nface value and accepted in their entirety do not prima \nfacie constitute any offence or make out a case against \nthe accused.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(2)\tWhere the allegations in the first information report and \nother materials, if any, accompanying the FIR do not \ndisclose a cognizable offence, justifying an investigation \nby police officers under Section 156(1) of the Code \nexcept under an order of a Magistrate within the purview \nof Section 155(2) of the Code.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(3) \tWhere the uncontroverted allegations made in the F.I.R. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">or complaint and the evidence collected in support of the \nsame do not disclose the commission of any offence and \nmake out a case against the accused. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">(4)  Where the allegations in the F.I.R. do not constitute a \ncognizable offence but constitute only a non-cognizable \noffence, no investigation is permitted by a Police Officer \nwithout an order of a Magistrate as contemplated under S. \n155(2) of the Code. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">(5)     Where the allegations made in the FIR or complaint are so \nabsurd and inherently improbable on the basis of which \nno prudent person can ever reach a just conclusion that \nthere is sufficient ground for proceeding against the \naccused. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">(6)     Where there is an express legal bar engrafted in any of the \nprovisions of the Code or the concerned Act (under which \na criminal proceeding is instituted) to the institution and \ncontinuance of the proceedings and/or where there is a \nspecific provision in the Code or the concerned Act, \nproviding efficacious redress for the grievance of the \naggrieved party. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_15\">(7)    Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly attended with \nmala fide and/or where the proceeding is maliciously \ninstituted with an ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance \non the accused and with a view to spite him due to private \nand personal grudge. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">As noted above, the powers possessed by the High Court under Section \n482 of the Code are very wide and the very plenitude of the power requires great \ncaution in its exercise. Court must be careful to see that its decision in exercise of \nthis power is based on sound principles. The inherent power should not be \nexercised to stifle a legitimate prosecution. High Court being the highest Court of \na State should normally refrain from giving a prima facie decision in a case \nwhere the entire facts are incomplete and hazy, more so when the evidence has \nnot been collected and produced before the Court and the issues involved, \nwhether factual or legal, are of magnitude and cannot be seen in their true \nperspective without sufficient material. Of course, no hard and fast rule can be \n<a href=\"/doc/1033637/\" id=\"a_7\">laid down in</a> regard to cases in which the High Court will exercise its \nextraordinary jurisdiction of quashing the proceeding at any stage. (See : The \nJanata Dal etc. v. H.S. Chowdhary and others, etc. (AIR 1993 SC 892), Dr. \nRaghubir Saran v. State of Bihar and another (AIR 1964 SC 1)). It would not be \nproper for the High Court to analyse the case of the complainant in the light of all \nprobabilities in order to determine whether a conviction would be sustainable and \non such premises, arrive at a conclusion that the proceedings are to be quashed. It \nwould be erroneous to assess the material before it and conclude that the \ncomplaint cannot be proceeded with. In proceeding instituted on complaint, \nexercise of the inherent powers to quash the proceedings is called for only in a \ncase where the complaint does not disclose any offence or is frivolous, vexatious \nor oppressive. If the allegations set out in the complaint do not constitute the \noffence of which cognizance has been taken by the Magistrate, it is open to the \nHigh Court to quash the same in exercise of the inherent powers under Section \n482 of the Code. It is not, however, necessary that there should be meticulous \nanalysis of the case before the trial to find out whether the case would end in \nconviction or acquittal. The complaint/F.I.R. has to be read as a whole. If it \nappears that on consideration of the allegations in the light of the statement made \non oath of the complainant or disclosed in the F.I.R. that the ingredients of the \noffence or offences are disclosed and there is no material to show that the \ncomplaint/F.I.R. is mala fide, frivolous or vexatious, in that event there would be \nno justification for interference by the High Court. When an information is \nlodged at the police station and an offence is registered, then the mala fides of the \ninformant would be of secondary importance. It is the material collected during \nthe investigation and evidence led in Court which decides the fate of the accused \nperson. The allegations of mala fides against the informant are of no consequence \nand cannot by itself be the basis for quashing the proceeding. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1014506\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1841921\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"444736\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"266365\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"444095\" id=\"span_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"579822\" id=\"span_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1218313\" id=\"span_9\">(See : <a href=\"/doc/1218313/\" id=\"a_8\">Mrs. \nDhanalakshmi v.

Nos. 4702-4704/2003, 513/2003,  \n2636/2003  are concerned. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">\tIn all these cases there was either statements of  witnesses or seizure of \nillicit distilled liquor  which factors cannot be said to be without relevance.  \nWhether the material already in existence or to be collected during investigation \nwould be sufficient for holding the concerned accused persons guilty  has to be \nconsidered at the time of trial.  At the time of  framing the charge it can be \ndecided  whether  prima facie case has been made out showing commission of an \noffence and involvement of  the charged persons.  At that stage also evidence \ncannot be gone into meticulously.  It is immaterial whether the case is based on \ndirect or circumstantial evidence.  Charge can be framed, if there are materials \nshowing possibility about the commission of the crime as against certainty.  That \nbeing so, the interference at the threshold with the F.I.R. is to be in very \nexceptional circumstances as held in R.P. Kapoor and Bhajan Lal cases (supra).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">Ultimately, the acceptability of the materials to fasten culpability on the \naccused persons is a matter of trial. These are not the cases where it can be said \nthat the FIR did not disclose commission of an offence.  Therefore, the High \nCourt was not justified in quashing the FIR in the concerned cases. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">\tSo far as Criminal Appeal Nos. 1183/2003, 1193-1196/2003   and Criminal \nAppeals arising out of  SLP(Crl.) Nos. 2191/2003, 2632/2003, 2633/2003,  and \n3463/2003 are concerned,  we find that the FIR did not disclose commission of \nan offence without anything being added or subtracted from the recitals therein. \nThough the FIR is not intended to be an encyclopedia of the background \nscenario, yet even skeletal features must disclose the commission of an offence. \nThe position is not so in these cases. Therefore, the High Court&#x27;s interference \ndoes not suffer from any legal infirmity, though the reasonings indicated by the \nHigh Court do not have our approval.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\"> In the ultimate analysis, Criminal Appeal Nos. 1180/2003, 1181/2003, \n1184-1189/2003, 1191-1192/03 and Criminal Appeals arising out of SLP (Crl.) \nnos.4702-4704/2003, 513/2003, 2636/2003 are allowed and Crl.
