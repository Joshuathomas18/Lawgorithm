We may now refer to the development which occurred during the\n\n   pendency of the writ petition. In FIR No. 314, as well as in the application\n\n   preferred thereafter, insinuation was definitely made that Respondent No.7\n\n   was responsible for the incident that occurred on 17.10.2019. It was also\n\n   submitted that the petitioner was hit by a car and suspicion was expressed in\n\n   clear terms that Respondent No.7 was behind the episode. As it now turns\n\n   out, she was not hit by a car but by a thela which prima facie means that the\n\n   allegations in her sworn statement before this Court were not truthful.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">   15.
