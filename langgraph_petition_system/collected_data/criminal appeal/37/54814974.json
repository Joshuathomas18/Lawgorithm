Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned\n\njudgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the Bombay High\n\nCourt, original accused nos. 1, 2 &amp; 4 have preferred Criminal Appeal\n\nNos. 1008-1009 of 2007.     The State of Maharashtra has also filed\n\nCriminal Appeal Nos. 881-882 of 2009 challenging the alteration of\n\ndeath sentence to life imprisonment in respect of original accused nos.\n\n3,5, &amp; 6 are concerned.

That the judgment and order dated\n\n30.04.2009 passed by this Court was sought to be reviewed at the\n\ninstance of the original accused nos. 3, 5 &amp; 6 on the ground that\n\naccused nos.3, 5 &amp; 6 had no opportunity to be heard by the Bench,\n\nbefore the appeals filed by the State of Maharashtra for enhancement\n\nof sentence were decided.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">2.2 That a three Judge Bench of this Court by its order dated\n\n31.10.2018 allowed the review applications, and recalled the judgment\n\nand order dated 30.04.2009 rendered by this Court not only qua\n\naccused nos. 3, 5 &amp; 6, but qua other accused also by observing that\n\nthe evidence is common and the offences relate to the same incident,\n\nand therefore, it is appropriate and proper that the judgment dated\n\n30.04.2009 should be recalled in its entirety, in relating to all the six\n\naccused. While allowing the review applications, this Court recalled\n\nthe judgment dated 30.04.2009 and directed the criminal appeals to\n\nbe restored to the file of this Court and directed that the appeals be\n\nplaced before the appropriate Bench for hearing afresh. It is to be\n\nnoted that this Court while restoring the appeals which have been\n\npreferred by the original accused nos. 1, 2 &amp; 4 and State of\n\nMaharashtra, also granted permission to accused nos. 3, 5 &amp; 6 to file\n\nappeals against the judgment of the High Court convicting them, if so\n\nadvised, and that is how accused nos.3, 5 &amp; 6 have preferred Criminal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                  5</span>\n\nAppeal Nos. 268-269 of 2019 against the judgment of the High Court\n\nconvicting them. Hence, all these appeals are now before the Court for\n\na fresh hearing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">3.   The prosecution version in nut and shell is as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     On 5/6/2003 Trambak and all his family members as well as the\n\nguest Bharat More were chitchatting after dinner and at about 10.30\n\np.m. seven to eight unknown persons entered his hut and all of them\n\nwere on banyan and half pant and they started threatening the family\n\nmembers. They demanded money as well as ornaments and Trambak\n\ntook out Rs. 3000/-from his pocket and handed over to one of them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">Some of the gang members forcibly took away the mangalsutra as well\n\nas ear-tops and dorley from the person of Vimalabai, ear-tops from the\n\nperson of Savita and silver rings which were around her feet. From the\n\nperson of Manoj they removed a silver chain and a wrist watch.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">Thereafter they went out of the hut and consumed liquor. After some\n\ntime they re-entered the hut with weapons like knife, axe handle,\n\nsickle, spade with handle and yokpin etc., so as to rob the house\n\nmembers and collect more money and ornaments etc. They started\n\nbeating the family members and Trambak was the first person who\n\nreceived assault. Sandeep and other members of the family told the\n\ndacoits to take away whatever they could collect from the house but\n\nno family members should be assaulted. At this stage Sandeep was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                    6</span>\n\nassaulted and so also Shrikant @ Bhurya, Bharat and Manoj. The\n\ndacoits did not spare Vimalabai as well. They tied hands and legs of all\n\nthe family members except Manoj and Vimalabai. As a result of\n\nassault Manoj, Trambak, Sandeep, Shrikant and Bharat had fallen\n\nunconscious. Three of the dacoits dragged Savita out of the hut and\n\ntook her to the guava garden. Two of the dacoits then picked up\n\nVimalabai and dragged her towards the well. One of them raped her\n\nnear the well and then she was taken to the guava garden where\n\nSavita was taken. Vimalabai was assaulted and brought back to the\n\nhut. After some time the three dacoits brought Savita back but in\n\nnaked condition and with injuries on her body. When the dacoits had\n\nentered the hut at about 10.30 p.m. the light bulb in the hut was\n\nburning and TV was on. The dacoits increased the volume of the tape\n\nrecorder and after they dropped Savita in the hut, they put on shoes\n\nand started walking on the persons lying injured and they thought\n\nthat all of them were dead. Vimalabai (PW 8) lost her consciousness\n\naround 12 O’ Clock in the night and till then the dacoits were present\n\nin the hut and they left the hut under the belief that all of the victims\n\nwere dead. However, PW 1 Manoj and his mother PW 8 Vimalabai\n\nsurvived.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">3.1 As per the case of the prosecution, in the morning at about 6:30\n\na.m. on 6.6.2013, one Vishnu Hagwane (PW12), nephew of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                    7</span>\n\nlandlord reached the spot and had seen the dead bodies.         By that\n\ntime, PW1 – Manoj Satote became conscious.         PW1 – Manoj Satote\n\nlodged the first information report against unknown persons.         The\n\ninvestigating officer started investigation. It appears that at different\n\ntimes, the investigation was carried out by four different officers. The\n\ninvestigating officer recorded the statement of the concerned witnesses\n\nincluding PW1 – Manoj Satote and PW8 – Vimalabai.\n3.2       The investigating officer also collected the medical evidence.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">The clothes from the five deceased persons, as well as, on the person\n\nof Manoj and Vimalabai were seized. From the spot some weapons\n\nlike wooden handle, spade with handle, yokpin and sickle were also\n\nseized.   The seized articles were sent for chemical analysis and CA\n\nreports from Exhibit 58 to Exhibit 72 were received.       That original\n\naccused nos. 1 &amp; 2 came to be arrested under arrest panchanamas\n\n(Exhibits 44 and 45) on 23.6.2003 by the Crime Branch. According to\n\nthe prosecution, the police during the course of investigation also got\n\ninformation that some other accused were also involved in a separate\n\ncrime registered with the police station at Bhokardhan in Jalna\n\ndistrict on 19.06.2003 and the police, therefore, filed an application\n\nbefore the competent Court seeking transfer of the accused in Crime\n\nNo. 74 of 2003 registered with the Bhokardhan police station and\n\nfinally accused nos. 3 to 5 came to be arrested on 27.06.2003 under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                   8</span>\n\narrest panchanamas (Exhibits 53, 54 and 55) after their custody was\n\ntransferred from the police station at Bhokardhan. That on the arrest\n\nof accused nos. 1 to 5 their clothes were seized and they were\n\nsubjected to medical examination.      On medical examination, some\n\ninjuries were found on accused nos. 1, 2 &amp; 4. The aforesaid accused\n\nnos. 1, 2 &amp; 4 were seen to have sustained some injuries within three\n\nweeks.   Medical certificates were issued by the concerned doctor\n\n(Exhibits 133 to 135 and Exhibits 195 &amp; 196). That during the course\n\nof the investigation, test identification parade of accused nos. 1 to 5\n\nwas held on 25.07.2003 by the Executive Magistrate.        In the test\n\nidentification parade, PW1 – Manoj Satote identified the five accused.\n\nPW8 – Vimalabai also identified accused nos. 1, 3, 4 and 5 as the\n\nunknown persons who had entered the hut and assaulted the family\n\nmembers. However, she could not identify accused no.2. It appears\n\nthat thereafter accused no.6 came to be arrested on 07.10.2004 and\n\nhis test identification parade was held on 9.10.2004.

By the common order dated\n\n14.11.2006 in both these applications, the High Court issued the\n\nfollowing directions:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">         “(i) The prosecution be allowed to lead additional\n              evidence of the Sub-Divisional Magistrate who\n              conducted the test identification parade in relation\n              to accused Nos.1 to 5 and all relevant documents\n              pertaining thereto.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">         (ii)       The defence be permitted to recall and\n                cross-examine PW-8 in relation to Exh. 122 which is\n                already on record.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">         (iii) In the event contradictions are established on record\n                in the cross-examination of PW-8, the learned Trial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                    15</span>\n\n               Judge should also recall PW-13 for directions of\n               those contradictions, if any.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        (iv)    Since the matter of confirmation is pending, it is\n               desired that the necessary recording of additional\n               evidence be completed before 7th of January, 2007.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">               List the matter for further orders in relation to\n               hearing on 9th January, 2007. The record may be\n               transmitted to the Trial Court for this purpose.”\n\n\n4.1 Consequently, PW8 and PW13 were further cross-examined by\n\nthe defence and the prosecution examined one additional witness i.e.\n\nShri Govind Alhate, City Magistrate at Nashik as PW25.          He had\n\nconducted the TI parade of accused nos. 1 to 5 on 25.07.2003.\n\nThrough his evidence the additional documents at Exhibits 217 to 229\n\nwere brought on record. Exhibits 224 to 228 are the memorandum of\n\nTI parade of each of the accused nos. 1 to 5 and Exhibit 229 is the\n\nexplanation submitted by the Sub-Divisional Magistrate.         At this\n\nstage, it is required to be noted that before the Sessions Court, the\n\nSub-Divisional Magistrate, who conducted the TI parade on 25.7.2003\n\nwas not examined, and therefore the High Court passed the aforesaid\n\norder and directed the prosecution to lead additional evidence of\n\nSub-Divisional Magistrate, who conducted the TI parade in relation to\n\naccused nos. 1 to 5, conducted on 25.7.2003.            That from the\n\ncross-examination of PW8 and PW13 and their additional depositions\n\nrecorded, consequent to the order passed by the High Court in\n\nCriminal Application Nos. 1 and 2 of 2006, it was found that PW13\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">\f                                    16</span>\n\nreceived the requisition for recording the dying declaration of PW8\n\nafter she had regained consciousness on 7.6.2003 and she had\n\nidentified the four accused from the photographs shown to her in File\n\nNo. 80 out of the three files handed over to him by the police, i.e., File\n\nNos. 70, 76 and 80. It also came on record that PW8 had, in fact,\n\nidentified four persons from the photographs with name, who are\n\nother than accused nos. 1 to 6.          That it was found that the\n\nprosecution withheld the aforesaid material evidence and suppressed\n\nthe material fact.   Therefore, it was also the case on behalf of the\n\naccused before the High Court that the prosecution was not fair and\n\nthey have suppressed/withheld the material evidence from the Court\n\nand, in fact, there was no investigation whatsoever with respect to\n\nthose four persons, who were identified by PW8. The High Court did\n\nnot agree with the submission on behalf of the accused and ignored\n\nthe Exhibit 122 as dying declaration of PW8 – Vimalabai, recorded by\n\nthe Executive Magistrate, Sonawane on the ground that PW8\n\nsubsequently survived,     Exhibit 122 cannot be said to be a dying\n\ndeclaration, and that it could at the most be termed as her previous\n\nstatement during the course of investigation, and that it cannot be\n\ntreated as a substantive evidence and at the most it could be used for\n\nthe limited purpose of corroboration or contradiction of the testimony\n\nof its maker and in any case it cannot be admissible under <a href=\"/doc/115795280/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 6</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                                   <a href=\"/doc/180268514/\" id=\"a_65\">17</a></span>\n\nor <a href=\"/doc/1959734/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 32</a> of the Evidence Act.      That thereafter, considering the\n\nmaterial on record and appreciating of evidence, the High Court by the\n\nimpugned judgment and order confirmed the conviction and sentence\n\nimposed upon accused nos. 1, 2 &amp; 4.         However, altered the death\n\nsentence to life imprisonment in respect of accused nos. 3, 5 &amp; 6. The\n\nHigh Court also acquitted accused nos. 3, 5 &amp; 6 for the offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1284610/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 376(2)(g)</a> of the IPC.     Hence, the present appeals by the\n\noriginal accused as well as the State of Maharashtra, as observed\n\nhereinabove.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">5.   Shri (Dr.) Yug Mohit Chaudhary, learned counsel has appeared\n\non behalf of the original accused and Shri Nishant Katneshwarkar,\n\nlearned counsel has appeared on behalf of the State of Maharashtra.\n\n5.1 Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the original accused has\n\nvehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the case,\n\nthe courts below have materially erred in convicting the accused.\n\n5.2 It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the original accused that the incident occurred after 10:30\n\np.m. at night. The victims were living in a hut made of gunny bags in\n\nthe Guava Orchard. There was no light facility in the hut. Even as\n\nper the case of the prosecution, the accused put off the light and\n\nthereafter whatever has happened, the same was in the torchlight. It\n\nis submitted therefore that it was very difficult for the witnesses, more\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                   18</span>\n\nparticularly PW1 and PW8 to identify the assailants/accused.\n\n5.3 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that in the present case the prosecution in\n\nsupport of its case has only relied upon the evidence of identification,\n\nand it is on this evidence alone that 6 people have been sentenced to\n\ndeath.   It is submitted that though the charge was for rape and\n\nmurder, there is no forensic evidence corroborating the prosecution\n\ncase. It is submitted by the learned counsel appearing on behalf of\n\nthe accused that, in fact, the DNA, finger print evidence and the initial\n\nidentification made by the victim contradict the prosecution case. It is\n\nsubmitted that there are no recoveries, finger print evidence, CA\n\nevidence or DNA evidence linking the accused to the crime.\n\n5.4 It is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that in the present case, the prosecution has\n\nrelied upon the deposition of two eye witnesses, PW1 and PW8. It is\n\nvehemently submitted that as such both the witnesses - PW1 &amp; PW8\n\nare not reliable and their deposition is not trustworthy.           It is\n\nsubmitted therefore both the courts below have materially erred in\n\nrelying upon or considering the deposition of PW1 &amp; PW8, while\n\nholding the accused guilty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">5.5 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that according to the two eye witnesses, PW1 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">\f                                  19</span>\n\nPW8, the offence was committed by 7-8 persons.         It is submitted\n\nhowever that PW1, as per the deposition of PW12 - nephew of the\n\nlandlord of Guava Orchard who was the first person to reach the spot,\n\ntold him that offence was committed by four persons.\n\n5.6 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that PW8’s entire evidence about the incident\n\nand the role played by the different accused persons is an omission\n\nand/or it can be said to be an improvement. It is submitted that none\n\nof what was stated in the deposition before the Court was stated to the\n\npolice in the various statements of the said witness that were recorded\n\nduring investigation and the first time the allegations are made after\n\ntwo and a half years later during the deposition in Court.        It is\n\nsubmitted that when the aforesaid was specifically pointed out by the\n\ndefence before the learned Sessions Court as well as before the High\n\nCourt, both the courts below have ignored the same by observing that\n\nthe omissions/improvements/contradictions are not major which\n\nwould fatal the case of the prosecution.   It is submitted that as such\n\nthe omissions/improvements/contradictions in the deposition of PW8\n\nare   major   contradictions/omissions/improvements     which    would\n\ndestroy the case of the prosecution and which are fatal to the case of\n\nthe prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">5.7 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                    20</span>\n\nbehalf of the accused that PW8 identified A2 in the court as the person\n\nwho had taken Savita outside the hut and impliedly raped her. It is\n\nfurther submitted that PW8 was not able to identify him in the TIP. It\n\nis submitted that her failure to identify him in the TIP soon after the\n\noffence renders her identification in court many years later nugatory.\n\nIt is submitted that it is on the basis of PW8’s statement about A2\n\nbeing the rapist that he has been given the death penalty by the High\n\nCourt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">5.8 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that there was no light in the hut and the\n\nculprits had used torches.     It is submitted that it would be highly\n\nunlikely that the witnesses could have either been able to get a good\n\nlook at their faces or even remember them two months later.          It is\n\nsubmitted that it is required to be noted that neither PW1 nor PW8\n\ngave details about the description of the culprits – heights, hair, facial\n\nfeatures, complexion, beard etc. to the police during the investigation,\n\nyet they claim to be able to recognise/identify the accused in the TIP.\n\nIt is submitted that A1 to A5 were put up in a TIP almost 2 months\n\nafter the incident and 1 month after the arrest. It is submitted that A6\n\nwas put up in a TIP more than one year later and he too is purported\n\nto be identified by PW1 &amp; PW8.       It is submitted that therefore the\n\naccused could not have been convicted on the basis of their being\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">\f                                   21</span>\n\nidentified by PW1 &amp; PW8 in the TIP, which were conducted after a long\n\ntime and that too when no specific description was given either by\n\nPW1 or PW8 in the FIR and/or in their earlier statements before the\n\npolice recorded during the investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">5.9 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that before evidence of identification can be\n\nrelied upon, the court has to be convinced that there was sufficient\n\nlight to enable the witness to observe the features of the culprit, and\n\nthat the witness was in a fit condition to see and remember.      It is\n\nsubmitted that in the present case, PW1 &amp; PW8 had fallen\n\nunconscious during the incident; PW1 very early when the incident\n\ntook place, and PW8 a little later. They both had been severely injured\n\nand their capacity to observe and notice the features of the assailants\n\nwould have been severely compromised.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">5.10 It is further submitted by the learned counsel on behalf of the\n\naccused that the incident occurred at night at 10:30 p.m. The hut\n\nwas made of gunny bags and its walls were made from stems and\n\nplants. There was no door to the hut. There was no electricity meter\n\nin the hut.   It is submitted that the IO(PW20), who made the spot\n\npanchnama, had admitted in his evidence that “there is no mention in\n\nthe panchnama as to whether there was light or not in the shed (hut)”.\n\n5.11 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">\f                                   22</span>\n\nbehalf of the accused that though PW1 insists that the electric light\n\nwas on, he also states that the culprits were using battery torches and\n\nwere searching in torchlight. He admits that he had told the police\n\nthat the culprits had switched off the lights when they had started\n\nassaulting the victims. It is submitted that even if it is assumed that\n\nthere was some light, the prosecution case at its highest would show\n\nthat during the incident the light bulb was burning for a few minutes\n\nbefore it was turned off, and the rest of the incident took place under\n\ntorchlights carried by the culprits.    It is submitted that in these\n\ncircumstances, neither PW1 nor PW8 would have been able to get a\n\nproper look at the persons who committed the offence. According to\n\nthe learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused, the following\n\nfacts would prove that PW1 &amp; PW8 were not able to get a proper look\n\nat the persons who committed the offence:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      (i)   neither PW1 nor PW8 were able to describe the accused to\n\n      the police or the clothes worn by them;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      (ii) no identifying features were given;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      (iii) during the trial, the clothes seized from the accused were\n\n      not identified by either PW1 or PW8;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      (iv) though the weapons of assault were seized from the spot of\n\n      the offence, these were not shown to PW1 probably because he\n\n      would not have been able to identify them;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">\f                                  23</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      (v) even though the age of one of the appellants was 17, and 2\n\n      were around 20, PW1 and PW8 told the police that the culprits\n\n      were aged 25-30 years;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">      (vi) neither PW1 nor PW8 were able to ascribe specific roles to\n\n      the culprits. The allegations about the commission of the\n\n      assault were in omnibus terms. PW1 especially does not assign\n\n      any role to A2, A4, A5 and A6;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      (vii) most importantly, PW8 has identified an entirely different\n\n      set of people from the photo albums shown to her soon after the\n\n      offence. Her evidence during the trial shows that even at the\n\n      point of time she was convinced that the persons she had\n\n      identified in the photographs shown to her by the magistrate,\n\n      which admittedly were of some other persons, were photographs\n\n      of the accused’ and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      (viii)   the aforesaid deficiencies in the testimonies of PW1 &amp;\n\n      PW8 can only be explained by the insufficiency of light at the\n\n      time of the incident.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">5.12 In so far as the identification of the accused by PW1 &amp; PW8 is\n\nconcerned, it is vehemently submitted by the learned counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of the accused that such an identification is not\n\nbelievable on number of grounds. It is submitted that as such it can\n\nbe said to be a mistaken identity. It is submitted that PW8 had earlier\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">\f                                     24</span>\n\nidentified some other persons. It is submitted that on 7.6.2003m i.e.\n\n2 days after the offence, PW8 – Vimalabai identified the photographs of\n\n4 people from a file of notorious criminals shown to her by PW13 –\n\nRamesh Sonawane, Special Executive Magistrate in the hospital as\n\nthose who committed the offence.          The present accused were not\n\namong those four persons identified by PW8 from the photo album.\n\n5.13 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that PW8’s statement identifying 4 other people\n\non 7.6.2003 is the first identification made less than 2 days after the\n\nincident and is closest to the date of incident. This identification was\n\nmade by PW8 when the images were still fresh in her mind and\n\nmemory had not faded.       The subsequent identification by PW1 and\n\nPW8 identifying the present accused occurred on 25.7.2003 which is\n\nmore than 1 ½ months after the date of incident wherein PW8 failed to\n\nidentify A2, and attributed an entirely contrary role to A6. It is\n\nsubmitted that the photo identification being first in point of time and\n\nclose to the date of offence is of great significance.\n\n5.14 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that the results of photo identification\n\ncompletely contradict PW8’s identification of the accused in TIP and\n\nthe court. It is submitted that in the light of this contradiction, her\n\nTIP identification and court identification are liable to be set aside. It\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">\f                                   25</span>\n\nis further submitted, that the identification in the court is a\n\nsubstantive evidence which is materially contradicted by the photo\n\nidentification and therefore identification in court cannot be relied\n\nupon.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">5.15 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that PW8’s identification of 4 other people even\n\ncontradicts the identification made by PW1 in the TIP and court and\n\ntherefore renders the same unreliable. It is further submitted that as\n\nper PW1’s own testimony, he lost consciousness soon after the\n\nassailants entered the hut.      It is also submitted that PW1 lost\n\nconsciousness much before PW8.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">5.16 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that accounting for PW8’s earlier identification of\n\n4 persons and subsequent identification of the present 6 accused,\n\nPW8 has in all identified 10 people as accused whereas it is the case of\n\nthe prosecution that only 7 persons have committed the said offence.\n\nIt is submitted that due to this mistaken identification by PW8, no\n\nreliance can be placed on PW8’s evidence of identification of the\n\naccused.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"117134\" id=\"span_31\">In support of his submission, he has relied upon the\n\ndecisions of this Court in the cases of <a href=\"/doc/117134/\" id=\"a_68\">Vaikuntam Chandrappa vs.\n\nState of Andhra Pradesh</a>, AIR 1960 SC 1340.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_37\">5.17 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                   26</span>\n\nbehalf of the accused that PW1 in his evidence in court had said that\n\nthe offence was committed by 7-8 persons.       He had said the same\n\nthing in his FIR recorded on the day of the offence i.e. on 6.6.2003.\n\nHowever, before recording of the FIR, at the spot of the incident itself,\n\nbefore being taken to hospital, he had told PW12 (the person who\n\ndiscovered the crime) that the offence was committed by 4-5 persons.\n\nIt is submitted that this huge discrepancy in the number of assailants\n\ncasts a serious doubt over the reliability of the evidence of PW1 and\n\nPW8 that this offence was committed by 7-8 persons.                Their\n\nsubsequent evidence in court about the number of assailants and role\n\nplayed by each of the accused is clearly an improvement and\n\ncontradicts what they had said earlier.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_38\">5.18 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that similarly in her testimony in Court, PW8\n\nhad said that the offence was committed by 7 persons. In her first\n\nstatement to the police, she had said that the offence was committed\n\nby 7-8 persons.      It is submitted that the likelihood of mistaken\n\nidentification by PW1 and PW8 of the accused is strengthened by the\n\nfollowing facts:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      (i)   PW1 has repeatedly stated that the culprits spoke with\n\n      them in Hindi. According to him, they were also speaking\n\n      amongst themselves in Hindi. PW8 has confirmed this. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">\f                                   27</span>\n\n      victims are all Marathi speakers. According to the police\n\n      investigation,   the   accused-appellants    too    hail        from\n\n      Maharashtra      and   are   Marathi    speakers.          If    the\n\n      accused-appellants were to speak with the victims they\n\n      would have spoken in Marathi not in Hindi. The fact that\n\n      the culprits spoke in Hindi clearly indicates that they were\n\n      not Marathi speakers.        This also points to the false\n\n      implication of the accused-appellants in this offence.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_39\">5.19 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that as such PW8’s entire testimony in the court\n\nhas the omission and/or improvement. It is submitted that prior to\n\nher deposition in court, two statements dated 6.6.2003 and 7.6.2003\n\nwere recorded by the police and the magistrate respectively.            It is\n\nsubmitted that what is stated by PW8 in the court was not stated by\n\nher in her earlier statements, more particularly with respect to how\n\nthe incident had taken place. It is submitted that this evidence has\n\ncome for the first time through her deposition in court by way of an\n\nimprovement amounting to a contradiction. It is submitted that PW8\n\nin her earlier statements, recorded during the investigation, has\n\nneither given any details of the assault or of the roles played by\n\ndifferent persons. It is submitted that even in the TIP, she did not\n\nattribute any role to the persons she identified, and neither did she do\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">\f                                   28</span>\n\nso after the TIP in any statement recorded by the police.          It is\n\nsubmitted that for the first time PW8 gave any details about the\n\nincident for ascribed role to the accused persons, two and a half years\n\nlater in the court and never before that. It is submitted therefore that\n\nher failure to give any information or statement to the police and the\n\ntwo magistrates either about the events occurring during the incident\n\nor the role played by the different persons renders her evidence on\n\nthis point unreliable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">5.20 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that in fact PW8 suppressed the material fact\n\nfrom the court when her first deposition was recorded by the learned\n\nSessions Court. It is submitted that PW8 suppressed the material fact\n\nfrom the Court that in fact on 7.6.2003 she was shown the\n\nphotographs before the executive magistrate and that she identified\n\nfour persons who are other than the accused who came to be tried. It\n\nis submitted that when she was further confronted with the same, in\n\nher further cross-examination, which was recorded pursuant to order\n\ndated 14.06.2006 passed by the High Court while hearing the\n\nConfirmation Case, she turned around and stated that she identified\n\nfour persons having committed the offence, who were out of the six\n\npersons she identified in TIP and before the Court. It is submitted\n\nthat the same is a material contradiction and it was a case of material\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">\f                                   29</span>\n\nsuppression and therefore PW8’s testimony is not reliable and\n\ntrustworthy and therefore it would be unsafe to rely upon the\n\ndeposition of such witness as PW8 and to convict the accused relying\n\nupon the deposition of such a witness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">5.21 In so far as A2 is concerned, it is further submitted by the\n\nlearned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused that though PW8\n\nclaimed that A2 had taken Savita out of the hut and raped her and\n\nbrought her back in a naked condition, she was unable to identify A2\n\nin TIP.    It is submitted that her identification in court of A2,\n\nunsupported by a previous identification in the TIP cannot be\n\naccepted, especially given the light conditions at that time and the\n\nfact that she herself became unconscious during the proceedings. It\n\nis submitted that there is no recovery from A2. PW8 is the only one\n\nwho said that A2 was involved in Savita’s rape. It is submitted that it\n\nis on the basis of this statement, uncorroborated by a previous TIP,\n\nthat A2 has been singled out and given the death sentence.        It is\n\nsubmitted that as such the learned Sessions Court erred in holding\n\nthat PW8 identified all the accused in the TIP and identified A6 in the\n\nsecond TIP. It is submitted that it is a clear error as PW8 did not\n\nidentify A2 in the first TIP.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">5.22 In so far as the identification of and role attributed to A6 is\n\nconcerned, It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                    30</span>\n\non behalf of the accused that A6 was put up for identification in the\n\nsecond TIP conducted by PW13 on 7.10.2004. It is submitted that\n\nonly PW1 deposes to having identified A6 in the second TIP.         PW8\n\ndoes not speak of attending any TIP where she identified A6. It is\n\nsubmitted that PW13’s statement that PW8 identified A6 in the\n\nsecond TIP is hearsay and inadmissible as such because PW8 does\n\nnot mention anything about the second TIP. She says that she was\n\ncalled for a TIP where she identified four persons and that these four\n\npersons were present in court out of the six accused persons.\n\n5.23 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that PW13, the Special Executive Magistrate\n\nconducted the TI parade for A6. It is submitted that he is the same\n\nmagistrate who earlier recorded PW8’s statement on 7.6.2003 where\n\nshe identified 4 other persons. It is submitted therefore that he had\n\ntherefore already participated in the investigation prior to this parade.\n\nIt is submitted that PW13, the executive magistrate, does not mention\n\nany precautions taken by him to prevent the witnesses seeing the\n\naccused prior to the parade.    It is submitted that on the contrary he\n\nadmits that the parade was held in an open space. It is submitted\n\nthat TI parade should have been held in a closed room to prevent the\n\nwitnesses who are outside from seeing the accused being brought to\n\nthe parade or his place in the line up. It is submitted that there is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                                  31</span>\n\nalso no statement that the dummies resembled the accused persons.\n\nIt is submitted that as such neither PW1 nor PW8 who claimed to be\n\nthe eye witnesses gave any description with respect to the accused or\n\nthe persons who committed the offence, and therefore, on what basis\n\ndummies were selected is questionable. It is submitted that as such\n\nthe executive magistrate was required to be selected the dummies\n\nhimself but he admits that dummies were selected by the police.\n\n5.24 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that as per PW13’s evidence, PW8 identified A6\n\nas the person who had assaulted her, dragged her daughter out of the\n\nhut and raped her. However, in the absence of PW8 having deposed\n\nanything about the second TIP or about having identified A6 in any\n\nTIP, this evidence of PW13 is inadmissible as hearsay.\n\n5.25 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that PW13’s statement attributed to PW8 that\n\nA6 had dragged Savita outside the hut is contradicted by her oral\n\nevidence in court where she says that A1, A2 and A4 dragged Savita\n\noutside the hut. The persons who had dragged Savita outside the hut\n\nwere obviously the same ones who had raped her. In her evidence in\n\ncourt PW8 was quite clear that it was three persons who done this,\n\nand she named A1, A2 and A4 as those three. In court, she does not\n\nattribute this role to A6. It was on this basis that the High Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                   32</span>\n\nupheld their death sentence and distinguished their case from the\n\nothers whose sentences were commuted. Her statement during the\n\nTIP contradicts her statement in court and gives an inconsistent\n\naccount of the events.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_43\">5.26 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that if the ‘her’ refers to PW8 herself, then this\n\nrole attributed by PW8 to A6 is inconsistent with the role of PW1\n\nattributes to A6 when he identifies him in the parade, which is that\n\nA6 had dragged Savita outside the hut.      As mentioned earlier, the\n\npersons who dragged Savita outside the hut were the ones who raped\n\nher.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_44\">5.27 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that in court PW1 does not mention Savita\n\nbeing taken outside the hut at all. In fact, his deposition makes it\n\nclear that he had fainted and did not witness any assault on Savita.\n\n5.28 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that even in the present case the delay in test\n\nidentification parade is fatal to the case of the prosecution.     It is\n\nsubmitted that in the present case, the offence occurred on 5.6.2003,\n\nthe date of arrest of the accused is 23rd and 27th June, 2003, and the\n\nTIP was held on 25.7.2003, i.e., 50 days from the date of the offence\n\nand 33 days after the arrest of A1 and A2. It is submitted that there\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                                   33</span>\n\nis no explanation forthcoming from the prosecution for the delay in\n\nconducting TIP.   According to the learned counsel, the most likely\n\nexplanation is that this period was used by the police to show\n\nphotographs to PW1 and PW8 so as to make them memorize the\n\nfeature of the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">5.29 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that in so far as the TIP in respect of A6 is\n\nconcerned, the TIP is vitiated on account of delay as A6 was arrested\n\nmore than one year later and the TIP for A6 was conducted more than\n\none year later.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_46\">5.30 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that PW8 has admitted that she had come twice\n\nor thrice to court prior to her deposition. It is submitted that during\n\nthese visits, she would have definitely seen the accused persons in\n\nthe dock and therefore her deposition in court does not have much\n\nsignificance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_47\">5.31 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that even otherwise no reliance can be placed\n\nupon the deposition of PW8. It is submitted that first of all PW8 does\n\nnot say anything in her first deposition with respect to her statement\n\nrecorded by the executive magistrate on 7.6.2003, and that she was\n\nshown the photographs from the album and she having identified four\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                                   34</span>\n\npersons having committed the offence were other than six accused\n\npersons who were tried. It is submitted that it is important to note\n\nthat PW8 denied in her first deposition that the photographs of the\n\naccused were shown to her by the police. It is clear from the evidence\n\nthat when PW8 denied the suggestion that she was not shown the\n\nphotographs, she was not telling the truth. It is submitted that when\n\nshe was called for further cross-examination, pursuant to the order\n\npassed by the High Court, she then admitted that , (i) police had\n\nshown 4 photographs of the accused persons, and that she herself\n\ntold that those were the same accused persons of the incident; and (ii)\n\nthat when my statement was recorded by the magistrate, the persons\n\nwho I had identified as accused persons were some other persons\n\nother than the present accused.     It is therefore submitted that the\n\naforesaid is just contrary to what the executive magistrate has\n\nrecorded in the first statement of PW8 on 7.6.2003.\n\n5.32 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that DNA or Forensic evidence will not support\n\nthe case of the prosecution and/or linked the accused to the crime. It\n\nis submitted that though the charge is of rape and murder, there is\n\nno forensic evidence corroborating the prosecution case.\n\n5.33 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that the case of the prosecution is that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">\f                                   35</span>\n\naccused-appellants were consuming liquor at the spot from liquor\n\nbottles and from a handi. Empty liquor bottles, a handi and some\n\nglasses were seized from the scene of crime. It is submitted that there\n\nis no DNA or finger prints on the glass and liquor bottles to connect\n\nthe appellants with the crime. The IO, PW20 admitted that the finger\n\nprint report did not implicate the accused.      It is important to note\n\nthat the appellants’ DNA samples were collected during              the\n\ninvestigation, as admitted by the IO, PW18 and were sent for DNA\n\nanalysis, but the prosecution never presented the report to the court\n\nfor the obvious reason that it would have exonerated the appellants.\n\n5.34 It is further submitted that no public hair, DNA, semen or blood\n\nof the appellants was found on any of the victims.        Samples were\n\ncollected from the appellants and sent for analysis but the results did\n\nnot incriminate the appellants. It is submitted that the police seized\n\n14 slippers from the scene of the crime, but the same could not be\n\nlinked to the appellants by either matching them or making the\n\naccused were them. No one identified those slippers as being worn by\n\nthe appellants or belonging to the appellants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">5.35 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused - appellants that clothes were seized from the\n\nappellants when they were arrested, as well as from the homes during\n\nthe house searches, but nothing was found to connect the accused\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">\f                                    36</span>\n\nwith the said crime.       It is submitted that footprints were found\n\naround the house the next morning when the bodies were discovered,\n\nbut those finger prints were not matched to the appellants.      It is\n\nsubmitted that even the blood found in the nail clippings of Savita,\n\nwas not connected to the appellants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_49\">5.36 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that as such there is no recovery of the cash\n\nand/or any of the gold ornaments alleged to have been stolen/looted\n\nfrom the place.     It is submitted that as per the prosecution case,\n\nRs.3,000/- in cash were taken from Trambak; a mangalsutra, dorley\n\nand ear tops were taken from PW8; anklets and ear tops were taken\n\nfrom Savita; and a watch and chain were taken from PW1 by the\n\nculprits.     It is submitted that no stolen property was found or\n\nrecovered from any of the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_50\">5.37 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that a while metal chain was allegedly seized\n\nduring the house search of Bhojubai Appa Shinde, the mother of A5\n\non 26.6.2003.      Her signature is also not there on the panchnama.\n\nMoreover, the panchnama does not state that the seized property was\n\nsealed.     It is submitted that the chain is described as “one white\n\nmetal chain with 30 links, middle link is broken and tied with a\n\nstring.     Value 0”.   It is submitted that the chain had no special\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">\f                                     37</span>\n\nmarkings on it and was of a mass-produced type that is freely\n\navailable. The prosecution claimed that this belonged to PW1. PW1\n\nhimself admitted that he had not given any description of the chain to\n\nthe police. A white metal chain is not such an item that could only be\n\npossessed by PW1.       It is submitted that apart from this chain,\n\nnothing was seized or recovered from any of the accused in this case.\n\nIt is vehemently submitted that had this crime been committed by the\n\naccused, surely all the stolen property would have been recovered.\n\nThe seizure of a commonly available silver chain without any\n\ndistinctive markings is too feeble a link to be held against the\n\naccused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_51\">5.38 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf   of   the   accused   that   no   Magistrate/Special   Executive\n\nMagistrate/Tehsilder has been examined regarding conducting of the\n\nTIP for the silver chain.     No witness has been examined who was\n\npresent when the chain was identified by PW1. PW14 is the panch\n\nbefore whom the packet containing the chain was opened and then\n\nresealed on the very day that PW1 claims he identified it, but PW14 is\n\nnot a witness to the identification and he does not depose about it.\n\n5.39 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that PW8 does not identify the chain. It is not\n\nshown to her during her evidence. In Court, PW8 stated “Muddemal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">\f                                   38</span>\n\narticle nos. 72 and 40 are the ornaments of Savita”.        In inquest\n\npanchnama dated 6.6.2003 (Exhibit 27) conducted over Savita’s dead\n\nbody, the corpse is described as “on her neck there is a white pearl\n\nnecklace, and on each of her hands there are 2-2 white metal\n\nbangles”.   These articles, among others, have been seized vide\n\npanchnama (Exhibit 42 dated 6.6.2003).       It is submitted that it is\n\npossible that some of these ornaments seized from Savita’s person\n\nhave been shown to and identified by PW8 during her testimony.\n\n5.40 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that in the absence of any recovery or seizure of\n\nany kind that connects the appellants to the crime and the\n\nprosecution has not been able to adduce any evidence corroborating\n\nthe identification by PW1 and PW8, the conviction of the accused\n\ncannot be sustained based on identification alone. In support of his\n\nsubmission, learned counsel has heavily relied upon the decision of\n\nthis Court in the case of Iqbal vs. State of Uttar Pradesh (2015) 6 SCC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_52\">623.\n\n5.41 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that insofar as conviction of the accused under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1284610/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 376(2)(g)</a> of the IPC is concerned, the same is based on no\n\nevidence. It is submitted that prosecution case is that according to\n\nthe evidence of PW8, the A1, A2 and A4 dragged the deceased Savita\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                   39</span>\n\nout of the hut and brought her back naked and bleeding by which\n\ntime she was dead. It is submitted that as per the CA report dated\n\n27.11.2003, no semen was found in the pubic hair, vaginal or uterus\n\nswab of deceased Savita. It is submitted that the blood found in the\n\nnail clippings of the deceased Savita matched with her own blood\n\ngroup and it could not be proven that the blood group belonged to the\n\naccused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_53\">5.42 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that PW8 on whose testimony the prosecution is\n\nrelying upon to convict the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1284610/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 376(2)(g)</a> of the IPC\n\nfailed to identify A2 in the TIP conducted on 25.7.2003 and identified\n\nA2 for the first time in court. It is submitted that in the absence of\n\nany previous identification of A2, it is extremely dangerous to convict\n\nA2 under <a href=\"/doc/1284610/\" id=\"a_71\">section 376(2)(g)</a> of the IPC, solely on the basis of\n\nidentification in court by PW8.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_54\">5.43 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that while convicting the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1284610/\" id=\"a_72\">Section\n\n376(2)(g)</a> of the IPC, the High Court considered the failure of the\n\naccused to explain their injuries as an incriminating circumstance\n\nagainst them.   It is submitted that mere failure of the accused to\n\nexplain injuries cannot be held against them if the nature of the\n\ninjuries are such that they can be caused due to other events.      In\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">\f                                   40</span>\n\nsupport of his submission, learned counsel for the accused has\n\nheavily relied upon the decision of this Court in the case of Ram\n\nSunder Sen vs. Narender, (2016) 15 SCC 440.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">5.44 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that one of the reasons the High Court has\n\nconvicted the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1284610/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 376(2)(g)</a> of the IPC is the\n\npresence of injury marks on the accused. The High Court has held\n\nthat deceased Savita caused these injuries on the accused as a result\n\nof resistance.   It is submitted that it has come in the evidence of\n\nPW16-Dr. Shimpi, who examined A4 that the injuries sustained by A4\n\ncould have been caused by labour or agricultural work and the said\n\ninjuries could be older than three weeks, i.e., before the date of the\n\noffence. It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that even from the arrest memo, it can be seen\n\nthat and even otherwise the accused are agriculturist labourer and\n\ntherefore such minor injuries were possible while doing the labour\n\nwork   or   agricultural   work.    It    is   submitted   that   therefore\n\nnon-explanation of the said injuries by the accused in their 313\n\nstatement could not have been held to be an incriminating\n\ncircumstance against the accused.        It is submitted therefore that the\n\nHigh Court has committed a grave error in considering the above\n\ncircumstance against the accused and/or drawing an adverse\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">\f                                   41</span>\n\ninference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_56\">5.45 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that PW24-Dr. Vilas Appasaheb Patil examined\n\nA1 &amp; A2 and stated that the injuries found on them were possible if a\n\nperson tried to resist another person.    It is submitted that merely\n\nbecause the injuries are possible on account of resistance does not\n\nmean that the injuries can be considered as conclusively to have been\n\ncaused during commission of rape. It is submitted that such injuries\n\ndo not link the present accused with the rape of Savita.\n\n5.46 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the accused that even the investigation was not fair and the\n\nprosecution suppressed the material facts before the Court.        It is\n\nsubmitted by the learned counsel that firstly the prosecution\n\nsuppressed that on 7.6.2003 the statement/dying declaration of PW8\n\nwas recorded aby the executive magistrate and that PW8 was shown\n\nthe photographs from the album and that she identified 4 persons\n\nhaving committed the offence, who were not the accused who came to\n\nbe tried.    It is submitted by the learned counsel that despite PW8\n\nidentified the 4 persons having committed the offence, neither they\n\nwere arrested nor there was any further investigation with respect to\n\nthose four persons, who were identified by PW8.            It is further\n\nsubmitted, that even the executive magistrate, who even subsequently\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">\f                                    42</span>\n\nconducted the TI parade on 25.7.2003 did not say anything in his\n\ndeposition. It is submitted by the learned counsel that therefore the\n\nprosecution has failed to perform its duty insofar as the fair\n\ninvestigation is concerned.    It is submitted that the duty of the\n\nprosecution is not to get the conviction of some persons, but it is the\n\nduty of the prosecution to see that the real culprits are not scot free\n\nand the innocent persons are not held guilty. It is submitted that the\n\nprosecution owes an obligation to be fair and just. It is submitted by\n\nthe learned counsel appearing on behalf of the accused that it is the\n\nduty of the prosecution to ensure that all material facts are brought\n\non record so that there might not be any miscarriage of justice. It is\n\nsubmitted that the prosecution is not expected to show a thirst to\n\nreach the case in the conviction of the accused somehow or the other\n\nirrespective of the true facts involved in the case. It is submitted that\n\nthe expected attitude of the prosecution must be couched in fairness\n\nnot only to the court, but to the accused as well. It is submitted that\n\neven it was the duty of the prosecution to winch it to the fore and\n\nmake it available to the accused any material which may even help\n\nthe accused. It is submitted that in the present case, it appears that\n\nthe   prosecution/investigating    officer/the   executive    magistrate\n\ndeliberately withheld/suppressed the aforesaid material facts from\n\nthe court. It is submitted that if the investigation would have been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">\f                                   43</span>\n\nconducted even with respect to those four persons who were identified\n\nby PW8, in that case the result would have been different.          It is\n\nsubmitted that if the fact that PW8 in her statement before the\n\nexecutive magistrate recorded on 7.6.2003 identified four persons\n\nwho committed the offence with names and they were other than the\n\npresent accused, would have come on record, in that case, it would\n\nhave gone against the prosecution case and more particularly the\n\ncase on behalf of PW1 &amp; PW8 that there were 7-8 persons who\n\ncommitted the offence.     It is submitted that if the aforesaid four\n\npersons would have been added, in that case, the accused would have\n\nbeen more than 12 and therefore it would have fatal to the case of the\n\nprosecution, and therefore the prosecution/investigating officer had\n\ndeliberately and wilfully suppressed the aforesaid material fact.\n\n5.47 It is further submitted by the learned counsel that in fact all the\n\naccused persons were belonging to nomadic tribes, and in fact, they\n\nwere arrested by transfer warrant and were forcefully involved in the\n\ncase, that too after a period one month and only with a view to show\n\nthat the police has solved the case.    It is submitted that otherwise\n\nthere was no reason to arrest the accused persons by way of transfer\n\nwarrant, when neither PW1 nor PW8 gave any description of the\n\npersons, who committed the offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">5.48 Making the above submissions, it is prayed to allow the appeals\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">\f                                   44</span>\n\npreferred by the accused and acquit them for the offences for which\n\nthey are convicted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_58\">5.49 Shri (Dr.) Yug Mohit Chaudhary, learned counsel appearing for\n\nthe accused has further submitted that in view of the above facts and\n\ncircumstances of the case, the accused are not only to be acquitted,\n\nbut as they suffered a lot and they are in jail since last 16 years and\n\nfor no fault of them they are languished in the jail since last 16 years\n\nand their valuable years have gone in the jail, all of them are entitled\n\nto a reasonable compensation. It is submitted that in fact out of the\n\nsix accused who were convicted, one of the accused was a juvenile.\n\nTill the year 2012 and till he was declared a juvenile and thereafter\n\nreleased, he was under a constant trauma which affected his health,\n\nphysical as well as mental.    In support of the above, he has relied\n\nupon a certificate of one Psychiatrist Doctor, Dr. Ashit Sheth. It is\n\nfurther submitted that even other accused who are in jail since last\n\n16 years were also under trauma and under the hanging sword on\n\nthem and the threat of the death sentence and therefore they\n\nremained under constant stress which are affecting their health and\n\nlife. It is submitted therefore that this is a fit case to exercise the\n\npowers under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_74\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India to award a\n\nreasonable compensation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_59\">6.

It is\n\nsubmitted that in the present case both PW1 &amp; PW8 who are the eye\n\nwitnesses and who were present at the time of the incident have fully\n\nsupported the case of the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_62\">6.3 It is further submitted by the learned counsel for the State of\n\nMaharashtra that as such all the accused persons have been\n\nidentified by PW1 &amp; PW8 in the TIP/before the Court.

It is submitted\n\ntherefore that the High Court has rightly ignored such minor\n\ncontradictions/omissions/improvements,         while    appreciating    the\n\ndeposition of PW1 &amp; PW8.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_64\">6.5 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the State that so far as non-disclosure of the factum of\n\nrecording the statement of PW8 on 7.6.2003 by the executive\n\nmagistrate   and   she   having   identified   four    persons   from   the\n\nphotographs is concerned, it is submitted that as such the said\n\nomission will not be fatal to the case of the prosecution as PW1 &amp;\n\nPW8 have specifically identified all the accused persons either in the\n\nTIP and/or before the Court.      It is submitted that merely because\n\nsome other four persons who might have been identified by PW8\n\nmight not have been arrested and/or there was no further\n\ninvestigation qua them, the said benefit cannot be given to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">\f                                   47</span>\n\naccused in the present case as all the accused persons were identified\n\nby PW1 &amp; PW8.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">6.6 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing on\n\nbehalf of the State that in the present case one of the articles stolen\n\nfrom the place of the incident was found from the house of the one of\n\nthe accused and therefore to that extent recovery was made and\n\ntherefore merely because other articles looted were not found, the\n\nrecovery of one of the articles cannot be ignored.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_66\">6.7 It is further submitted that even some of the accused failed to\n\nexplain the injuries found on their bodies in their statement under\n\nSection 313 of the Code and therefore an adverse inference has\n\nrightly been drawn against them and they are rightly convicted.\n\n6.8 It is further submitted by the learned counsel appearing for the\n\nState that even the prosecution has been successful in proving that\n\nSavita was subjected to rape and it is established and proved by\n\nleaving the medical evidence. It is submitted therefore that factum of\n\nthe rape on the deceased Savita has been established and proved. It\n\nis submitted that even the prosecution has been successful in proving\n\nthe rape on PW8 also.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_67\">6.9 It is submitted by the learned counsel that all the six accused\n\nhave committed a very serious offence and have committed the\n\nmurder of 5 persons and two ladies were raped and the entire family\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">\f                                      48</span>\n\nwas finished, their conviction is required to be upheld and all the\n\naccused are required to be sentenced to death penalty. Therefore, it\n\nis prayed to dismiss the appeals preferred by the accused and to allow\n\nthe appeals preferred by the State and to restore the death penalty so\n\nfar as accused nos. 3, 5 &amp; 6 are concerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">7.   We have heard the learned counsel appearing on behalf of the\n\nrespective parties at great length.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">7.1 At the outset, it is required to be noted that in the present\n\nappeals, respective accused were charged for the offences punishable\n\nunder Sections 395, 302 read with 34 of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_80\">IPC</a>, Section 376 (2)(g),\n\nSection 307 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 34</a> of the IPC, <a href=\"/doc/958439/\" id=\"a_82\">Sections 396</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1865117/\" id=\"a_83\">397</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/835557/\" id=\"a_84\">398</a> of the IPC. The learned Sessions Court convicted the accused\n\nunder Sections 395, 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/51553508/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 34</a>, Section 376(2)(g),\n\nSection 307 read with <a href=\"/doc/51553508/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 34</a>, Sections 396, 397 read with\n\nSection 395 and <a href=\"/doc/835557/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 398</a> of the IPC. Over and above the other\n\nsentences, all the accused were awarded the death penalty by the\n\nlearned Sessions Court.     The High Court confirmed and conviction\n\nand sentence imposed by the learned Sessions Court so far as A1, A2\n\nand A4 are concerned, and even confirmed the death penalty. While\n\nmaintaining the conviction for the offences punishable under Sections\n\n302 read with 34, 307 read with 34, 397 read with 395 and 396 of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_88\">IPC</a>, the High Court acquitted A3, A5 and A6 for the offences\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">\f                                  49</span>\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1284610/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 376(2)(g)</a> of the IPC and commuted the\n\ndeath sentence to life imprisonment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_70\">8.   Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned common\n\njudgment and order passed by the High Court, both the accused as\n\nwell as the State of Maharashtra have preferred the present appeals.\n\nThe accused are before this Court challenging their conviction and\n\nsentence imposed by the High Court, and the State of Maharashtra is\n\naggrieved by the impugned judgment and order passed by the High\n\nCourt insofar as acquitting the original accused nos. A3, A5 and A6\n\nfor the offences under <a href=\"/doc/1284610/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 376(2)(g)</a> of the IPC and commuting the\n\ndeath sentence to life imprisonment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">9.   We have perused and gone through in depth the impugned\n\njudgment and order passed by the High Court as well as the\n\njudgment and order passed by the learned Sessions Court. We have\n\ngone through and considered in detail the evidence on record, both\n\noral as well as documentary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_72\">9.1 As observed hereinabove, and even as per the case of the\n\nprosecution, the incident occurred after 10:30 p.m. at night.    The\n\nvictims were living in a hut made by gunny bags in guava orchard.\n\nAs per the case of the prosecution, the accused committed the\n\nmurder, robbery as well as the rape of one lady, named Savita and\n\nPW8 – Vimalabai. As per the case of the prosecution, the accused\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">\f                                    50</span>\n\nstripped the ornaments from the wife and daughter of Trambak, and\n\nalso took Rs.3,000/- from him. As per the case of the prosecution, A2\n\nraped Savita and took her outside the hut and thereafter she was\n\nkilled. As per the case of the prosecution, one Trambak was living in\n\nthe hut in the guava orchard with his family (wife, three sons and one\n\ndaughter).   In the unfortunate incident, Trambak, his daughter\n\nSavita, his nephew Bharat, his sons Sandeep and Bhurya died. PW1\n\n&amp; PW8 – son Manoj and Trambak’s wife Vimalabai survived.\n\nTherefore, according to the prosecution case, PW1 &amp; PW8 were the\n\neye witnesses to the whole incident.     Therefore, as such, the case\n\nrests on the deposition of these two eye witnesses PW1 &amp; PW8, and\n\nthey identified the accused either in the TI parade and/or before the\n\nCourt. Considering the entire material on record, it appears that the\n\nprosecution in support of its case has solely relied on the evidence of\n\nidentification. At this stage, it is required to be noted that though the\n\ncharge is of rape and murder, there is no forensic evidence\n\ncorroborating the prosecution case. Though, as per the case of the\n\nprosecution, the accused stripped the ornaments from the wife and\n\ndaughter of Trambak and took Rs.3,000/- from Trambak, there is no\n\nrecovery except one broken white metal chain, which was allegedly\n\nseized during the house search of Bhojubai Appa Shinde, the mother\n\nof A5 on 26.06.2003.      The aforesaid in detail shall be discussed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">\f                                   51</span>\n\nhereinbelow.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">9.2 As observed hereinabove, the case rests on the deposition of\n\nPW1 &amp; PW8 and they identified the accused in the TI parade as well\n\nas before the Court. Other than the evidence of PW1 &amp; PW8, there is\n\nno other evidence to link the accused to the offence. Looking to the\n\nnature of the crime committed in which five persons were killed\n\nbrutally and one was also raped, and the serious consequence it may\n\nhave for those convicted, it is necessary that the evidence should be\n\nof a very high quality and satisfy the higher burden of proof.\n\nTherefore, we have minutely gone through and considered the\n\ndeposition of PW1 &amp; PW8.      We have also minutely considered the\n\ndeposition of other witnesses, more particularly the deposition of\n\nPW13 – special executive magistrate – Ramesh Sonawane, PW12 –\n\nVishnu Hagwane, nephew of the landlord, who was the first person to\n\nreach the spot and the deposition of the investigating officer, PW18 –\n\nACP Bhaskarrao Dhus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">9.3 As per the case of the prosecution, which has been believed by\n\nthe learned Sessions Court as well as the High Court, PW1 &amp; PW8\n\nidentified the accused persons in the TI parade as well as before the\n\nCourt. At this stage, it is required to be noted that PW8 identified A2\n\nin the Court as the person who had taken Savita outside the hut, and\n\nraped her.     However, she was not able to identify him in the TI\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">\f                                  52</span>\n\nparade.   The first TI parade was conducted on 25.07.2003.        The\n\noffence occurred on 5.6.2003; accused nos. 1 to 5 were arrested on\n\n23rd and 27th June, 2003 and the TI parade was held on 25.07.2003,\n\ni.e., 50 days from the date of offence and 33 days after the arrest of\n\nA1 &amp; A2. It is required to be noted that the accused persons were\n\narrested on transfer warrant. None of the eye witnesses, i.e., PW1 &amp;\n\nPW8 were able to give any particulars/description of the accused.\n\nEven A6 was arrested more than one year, and the TI parade for A6\n\nwas conducted more than one year later.      There is no explanation\n\nforthcoming from the prosecution for the delay in conducting the TI\n\nparade. Therefore, the identification of the accused by PW1 &amp; PW8,\n\nwhich is the sole basis for convicting the accused and awarding the\n\ndeath penalty, is required to be considered very minutely.\n\n9.4 There is very serious doubt whether at the time of incident, there\n\nwas sufficient light in the hut. Even, according to PW1 &amp; PW8, the\n\nculprits had used torches. The incident had occurred at 10:30 p.m.\n\nThe hut was made of gunny bags and its walls were made from stems\n\nand plants. There was no door to the hut. There is no mention in the\n\npanchnama as to whether there was light or not in the shed (hut).\n\nThough, PW1 has stated that the electric light was on, he also states\n\nthat the culprits were using battery torches and were searching in\n\ntorchlight. According to him, he told the police that the culprits had\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">\f                                   53</span>\n\nswitched off the lights when they had started assaulting the victims.\n\nEven if it is assumed that there was some light initially, and the case\n\nof the prosecution is believed that during the incident the light bulb\n\nwas burning for a few minutes before it was turned off, the rest of the\n\nincident took place under torchlights carried by the culprits. Under\n\nthe circumstances, neither PW1 nor PW8 would have been able to get\n\na proper look at the persons who committed the offence.           It is\n\nrequired to be considered coupled with the fact that neither PW1 nor\n\nPW8 were able to describe the accused to the police or the clothes\n\nworn by them. No identifying features were given. In the trial, the\n\nclothes seized from the accused were not identified by either PW1 or\n\nPW8.   Even the age of one of the accused was 17 and two other\n\naccused were around 20 years, PW1 &amp; PW8 told the police that the\n\nculprits were aged 25-30 years. Neither PW1 nor PW8 were able to\n\nascribe the specific roles to the culprits.   Even, according to the\n\nprosecution, PW1 &amp; PW8 had fallen unconscious during the incident.\n\nTherefore, the said witnesses were not in a fit condition to see and\n\nremember and that is why neither PW1 nor PW8 gave details about\n\nthe description of the culprits – heights, hair, facial features,\n\ncomplexion, beard, etc. to the police during the investigation. Even\n\nPW8’s entire evidence about the incident and the role played by\n\ndifferent accused persons is an omission/improvement. Whatever is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">\f                                   54</span>\n\nstated by PW8 in her deposition, the same is stated for the first time\n\nin her deposition, which was recorded two and a half years later.\n\nWhatever is alleged in her deposition in the Court, which was\n\nrecorded two and a half years later, was not stated to the\n\npolice/special executive magistrate in her statements that were\n\nrecorded during the investigation. When the same was pointed out to\n\nthe courts below, the courts below, more particularly the High Court\n\nhas not accepted the case of the defence by observing that the\n\nomissions are minor omissions. On scanning the entire evidence of\n\nPW8, we do not accept the observation of the High Court that the\n\nomissions are minor omissions.      On considering the deposition of\n\nPW8 about the incident and the role alleged to have been played by\n\ndifferent accused persons, we are of the opinion that the omissions\n\nare major omissions and improvements which are fatal to the case of\n\nthe prosecution and in any case, it creates reasonable doubt on the\n\ntrustworthiness and the reliability of PW8.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">9.5 Even the identification of the accused by PW1 in the TI parade\n\nalso creates a serious doubt, apart from the fact that there was a\n\ndelay in conducting the TI parade, and that there is no explanation by\n\nthe prosecution in conducting the TI parade belatedly. As observed\n\nhereinabove, and for the reasons stated above, it is very doubtful\n\nwhether PW1 &amp; PW8 could have properly seen the accused.            As\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">\f                                   55</span>\n\nobserved hereinabove, there was no specific description of the\n\naccused given by the said two witnesses.     There are contradictions\n\nwith respect to the age of some of the accused. PW1 has categorically\n\nstated that the culprits spoke with him in Hindi. According to him,\n\nthey were also speaking amongst themselves in Hindi. PW8 has also\n\nconfirmed the same.     All the victims are Marathi speakers.      The\n\naccused also hail from Maharashtra and are Marathi speakers.\n\nTherefore, if the accused were to speak with the victims, they would\n\nhave spoken in Marathi and not in Hindi.        Therefore, there is a\n\npossibility that the culprits who were speaking in Hindi were not\n\nMarathi speakers and they might be outsiders – non-Marathis.\n\n9.6 As observed hereinabove, neither PW1 nor PW8 gave any\n\ndescription to the I.O. and/or to the Sub-Divisional Magistrate who\n\nconducted the TI parade. Therefore, on what basis the other dummy\n\npersons were brought and were present in TI parade is not\n\nforthcoming from the prosecution. There is also no statement that\n\nthe dummies resembled the accused persons.        Though, the special\n\nexecutive magistrate who had conducted the TI parade is required to\n\nselect the dummy persons, in the present case and even admitted by\n\nPW13 – special executive magistrate that dummy persons were\n\nselected by the police.       Considering the aforesaid facts and\n\ncircumstances, we are of the opinion that it is not safe to convict the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">\f                                    56</span>\n\naccused solely on the basis of their identification by PW1 &amp; PW8 in\n\nthe TI parade and/or before the Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">9.7 As observed hereinabove, except the deposition of PW1 &amp; PW8\n\nand they identified the accused in the TI parade and/or before the\n\nCourt (which for the reasons stated hereinabove, the conviction\n\ncannot rest on such identification), there is no other evidence, either\n\nscientific and/or other, corroborating the prosecution case. There is\n\nno forensic evidence corroborating the prosecution case. In fact, the\n\nDNA, finger prints evidence and CA evidence do not support the case\n\nof the prosecution, and/or link the accused to the crime. The case of\n\nthe prosecution is that the accused had some liquor at the spot from\n\nliquor bottles and from a handi. Empty liquor bottles, a handi and\n\nsome glasses were seized from the scene of crime. There is no DNA or\n\nfinger prints on the glass and liquor bottles to connect the accused\n\nwith the crime. In fact, PW20 – IO has admitted that the finger print\n\nreport did not implicate the accused. At this stage, it is required to be\n\nnoted that the accused’ DNA samples were collected during the\n\ninvestigation and in fact were sent for DNA analysis, but the\n\nprosecution never presented the report to the Court. No pubic hair,\n\nDNA, semen or blood of the accused were found on any of the victims.\n\nIt appears that the samples were collected from the accused and were\n\nsent for analysis, but the result did not incriminate the accused.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">\f                                   57</span>\n\n9.8 As per the case of the prosecution, Rs.3,000/- in cash were\n\ntaken from Trambak, a mangalsutra, dorley and ear tops were taken\n\nfrom PW8; anklets and ear tops were taken from Savita; and a watch\n\nand chain were taken from PW1 by the culprits. However, no stolen\n\nproperty has been found or recovered from any of the accused except\n\na broken white metal chain which was seized during the house search\n\nof the mother of A5 on 26.06.2003. However, her signature is not\n\nthere on the panchnama. The panchnama also does not state that\n\nthe seized property was sealed.     The chain was described as “one\n\nwhite metal chain with 30 links, middle link is broken and tied with a\n\nstring. The value of the same was stated to be zero”. The chain had\n\nno special markings on it and the same is freely available. Though\n\nthe prosecution claimed that the said chain belongs to PW1, PW1 had\n\nadmitted that he has not given any description of the chain to the\n\npolice. Barring this chain, nothing was seized or recovered from any\n\nof the accused. Therefore, the seizure of a commonly available white\n\nmetal silver chain without any distinctive markings would be a weak\n\npiece of evidence to hold the accused guilty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">9.9 Apart from the above, on considering the entire deposition of\n\nPW8, we are of the opinion that PW8 who claims to be an eye witness,\n\nshe is not a reliable and trustworthiness witness.          Her entire\n\ntestimony       in       Court       is         full   of     material\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">\f                                   58</span>\n\nomissions/contradictions/improvements.      Prior to her deposition in\n\nCourt, her two statements dated 6.6.2003 and 7.6.2003 were\n\nrecorded by the police and the magistrate respectively.      The entire\n\ndescription of incident given by PW8 in the Court has not been stated\n\nby her in her earlier statements. This evidence has come for the first\n\ntime during the deposition in Court by way of an improvement. In\n\nher earlier statements, PW8 has never given any details of the assault\n\nor the roles played by different persons during the incident. Even in\n\nthe TI parade, she did not attribute any role to the persons she\n\nidentified. The first time PW8 gave any details about the incident or\n\nascribed the roles to the accused persons was two and a half years\n\nlater in the Court and never before that. Her failure to give any\n\nstatement to the police and the two magistrates either about the\n\nevents occurring during the incident or the roles played by different\n\npersons     render    her   evidence    unreliable.   When     in    her\n\ncross-examination,       she     was     confronted     with        such\n\nomissions/improvements, she has taken only one thing that she told\n\nthis to the police but she does not know why the police did not record\n\nthe same.      However, the same is not corroborated by any other\n\nevidence, more particularly the deposition of the IO and/or the\n\nmagistrates.    Therefore, it is unsafe to rely upon the deposition of\n\nPW8 and to convict the accused. It is also required to be noted that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">\f                                     59</span>\n\neven according to PW8, she was subjected to rape, however, the\n\nprosecution has miserably failed to prove the rape on her by leading\n\ncogent evidence, more particularly the forensic evidence. Therefore,\n\nto that extent also she is not reliable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">9.10 There is one another reason why PW8 is not to be believed on\n\nthe ground that she is unreliable and not trustworthy. It is required\n\nto be noted that on 7.6.2003, i.e, two days after the incident, her\n\nstatement was recorded by PW13 – Ramesh Sonawane – Special\n\nExecutive Magistrate in the hospital.       PW13 was called by the\n\ninvestigating officer to record her dying declaration. It has come on\n\nrecord that her dying declaration/statement was recorded on\n\n7.6.2003, i.e., two days after the incident, PW8 identified photographs\n\nof four people from album of notorious criminals as those who\n\ncommitted the offence.      Admittedly, the present accused are not\n\namongst those four persons identified by PW8 from the photo album.\n\nIt is required to be noted that in her deposition she had not stated\n\nanything about her statement recorded by PW13 on 7.6.2003 and she\n\nidentified the photographs of four people from album of notorious\n\ncriminals shown to her.      Therefore, to that extent, there is also a\n\nsuppression of material fact by PW8.       In fact, the aforesaid was\n\nwithheld by the prosecution during the trial. Only during hearing of\n\nthe appeal before the High Court, it came to the light and therefore\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">\f                                  60</span>\n\npursuant to the order passed by the High Court she was recalled and\n\nwhen she was confronted with the above, very surprisingly, she stated\n\nthat four persons who were identified by her were the same persons\n\nout of the present accused. However, such a stand is just contrary to\n\nthe deposition of PW13 – special executive magistrate. What is stated\n\nby her in her deposition when she was recalled pursuant to the order\n\npassed by the High Court is not corroborated by other evidence. On\n\nthe contrary, PW13 – special executive magistrate in his further\n\nevidence has categorically stated as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">      “It is true that I was called on 7.6.03 by P.I of Crime\n      Branch to civil hospital Nashik to record the dying\n      declaration of Vimalbai Trambak Satote. Accordinglhy, I\n      have gone to civil hospital Nashik. After reaching to civil\n      hospital, I had taken the letter of PI Crime Branch. I am\n      having the Xerox copy of that letter. Today I am producing\n      the same. Police had given me the file nos. 70, 76, 80 and\n      I was requested to see whether that lady can identify the\n      accused from that file. I was given those files by the same\n      person who had given me the letter. I had asked that lady\n      whether she could identify the accused, if photographs\n      shown to her and she told that she could identify.\n      Therefore, I had shown her the photographs from all the\n      three files. She had identified the 4 persons as the\n      accused present. Witness volunteers that at that time, it\n      came to my notice that the lady was much frightened. All\n      the four photographs were from file No.80. The names\n      were written below all those four photographs. They are 1.\n      Gautam Hari Kale, R/o Zapwadi Shiv, TQ Nawasa, Dist.\n      Ahmednagar, 2. Shivaji @ Shivlya Bhosale R/o Tarwand\n      Muktapur Shiwar, TQ Nevasa, Dist – Ahmednagar 3.\n      Khandya Rama Chavan R/o Bhendala Shiwar, TQ\n      Gangapur, Dist. Aurangabad, 4. Suresh Sitaram Kale, R/o\n      Kasarakada, Karkhana Shiwar, TQ Ashti, Dist. Beed.\n      These persons had entered her house and had committed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">\f                                  61</span>\n\n      theft of Rs.3,000/- is told by the lady. That lady had not\n      stated that she could identify the accused persons. Prior\n      to recording the statement of that lady, said lady was got\n      examined from Dr. Yuvraj Pawar, that she was conscious\n      to give the statement. The statement was read over to that\n      lady after it was recorded. It was understood by her. I\n      had asked whether the said statement was as per her\n      narration. She had replied in affirmative. I had obtained\n      her thumb impression on the said statement. I myself had\n      obtained her thumb impression.         After completion of\n      recording of the statement of that lady, she had got again\n      examined from the medical officer, that she was in a\n      condition to give the statement. Medical officer had signed\n      on both certificate in my presence. I had not taken any\n      noting that said lady was frightened (The ld. A.P.P. has\n      taken the objection that the witness voluntarily had made\n      the statement that the lady was frightened; therefore,\n      such question cannot be asked in cross examination). I\n      had not written so in my notes. It is not true to say that I\n      was directed to state that said lady was frightened, before\n      coming to court for giving evidence.”\n\n9.11 Thus, the deposition of PW8 is full of contradictions/omissions\n\nand improvements and that she has not stated true and correct facts.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">Therefore, she is not a reliable witness who can be believed. When\n\nthe aforesaid was pointed out to the High Court by the defence, the\n\nHigh Court unfortunately has not accepted the case of the defence by\n\nobserving that the statement of PW8 recorded by PW13 – special\n\nexecutive magistrate recorded on 7.6.2003 cannot be said to be a\n\ndying declaration and it can be said to be a mere statement which can\n\nbe used only for corroboration and contradiction. Therefore, even as\n\nper the High Court also, her statement dated 7.6.2003 recorded by\n\nPW13 in which she identified altogether 4 other persons with names\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">\f                                     62</span>\n\ncan be used for the purpose of contradiction.                As observed\n\nhereinabove, the contradictions are material contradictions and that\n\nas such she has also suppressed the material fact from the Court.\n\n9.12 Even otherwise, for the reasons stated hereinafter, it appears\n\nthat   there   was    no   fair   investigation   by   the   investigating\n\nagency/prosecution.    Prosecution has suppressed the material fact\n\nfrom the Court. Neither the investigating officer nor even the PW13 –\n\nspecial executive magistrate initially stated anything about recording\n\nof the statement of PW8 on 7.6.2003 and she having identified four\n\npersons from the album of the photographs of the notorious\n\ncriminals. In fact, it came to the light during the course of hearing of\n\nthe appeal before the High Court, and PW8 and PW13 were recalled\n\nas per the directions of the High Court. Nothing is on record whether\n\nthose four persons, who were identified by PW8 on 7.6.2003, were\n\never arrested and/or any investigation was carried out qua them. It\n\nis required to be noted that PW8 identified those four persons\n\nimmediately after the incident. None of the accused in the present\n\ncase are those who were identified by PW8 before the Special\n\nExecutive Magistrate on 7.6.2003.         Therefore, when PW8 identified\n\nfour persons having committed the offence on 7.6.2003, her memory\n\nwas fresh and it ought to have been given more weightage than her\n\nidentifying the accused persons after a long delay. Thus, it appears\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">\f                                    63</span>\n\nthat the investigation was not fair and in fact there was suppression\n\nof material fact from the court by the prosecution.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_80\">10. It has to be uppermost kept in mind that impartial and truthful\n\ninvestigation is imperative.   It is judiciously acknowledged that fair\n\ntrial includes fair investigation as envisaged by <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_91\">Articles 20</a> <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_92\">&amp; 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. The role of the police is to be one for protection\n\nof life, liberty and property of citizens, that investigation of offences\n\nbeing one of its foremost duties.        That the aim of investigation is\n\nultimately to search for truth and to bring the offender to book.\n\n10.1 Apart from ensuring that the offences do not go unpunished, it\n\nis the duty of the prosecution to ensure fairness in the proceedings\n\nand also to ensure that all relevant facts and circumstances are\n\nbrought to the notice of the court for just determination of the truth\n\nso that due justice prevails.        It is the responsibility of the\n\ninvestigating agency to ensure that every investigation is fair and does\n\nnot erode the freedom of an individual, except in accordance with law.\n\nOne of the established facets of a just, fair and transparent\n\ninvestigation is the right of an accused to ask for all such documents\n\nthat he may be entitled to under the scheme contemplated by the\n\nCr.PC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"166228518\" id=\"span_70\">10.2 Nothing is allowed by the law which is contrary to the truth.     In\n\nIndian criminal jurisprudence, the accused is placed in a somewhat\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">\f                                   64</span>\n\nadvantageous position than under different jurisprudences of some of\n\nthe countries in the world. The criminal justice administration system\n\nin India places human rights and dignity for human rights at a much\n\nhigher pedestal and the accused is presumed to be innocent till proven\n\nguilty. The alleged accused is entitled to fair and true investigation\n\nand fair trial and the prosecution is expected to play a balanced role in\n\nthe trial of a crime.     The investigation should be judicious, fair,\n\ntransparent and expeditious to ensure compliance with the basic rule\n\nof law.     These are the fundamental canons of our criminal\n\njurisprudence and they are quite in conformity with the Constitutional\n\nmandate contained in <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_93\">Articles 20</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_94\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n10.3 As observed by this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/166228518/\" id=\"a_95\">V.K. Sasikala v. State</a>\n\nrepresented by Superintendent (2012) 9 SCC 771, though it is only\n\nsuch reports which support the prosecution case that are required to\n\nbe forwarded to the Court under Section 173(5), in every situation\n\nwhere some of the seized papers and the documents do not support\n\nthe prosecution case and, on the contrary, support the accused, a\n\nduty is cast on the investigating officer to evaluate the two sets of\n\ndocuments and materials collected and, if required, to exonerate the\n\naccused at that stage itself.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1956224\" id=\"span_72\">10.4 Even in a case where the public prosecutor did not examine the\n\nwitnesses who might have supported the accused, this Court in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">\f                                    65</span>\n\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/1956224/\" id=\"a_96\">Darya Singh v. State of Punjab</a> AIR 1965 SC 328 has\n\nobserved that the prosecution must act fairly and honestly and must\n\nnever adopt the device of keeping back from the Court only because\n\nthe evidence is likely to go against the prosecution case. It is further\n\nobserved that it is the duty of the prosecution to assist the court in\n\nreaching to a proper conclusion in regard the case which is brought\n\nbefore it for trial. It is further observed that it is no doubt open to the\n\nprosecutor not to examine witnesses who, in his opinion, have not\n\nwitnessed the incident, but, normally he ought to have examined all\n\nthe eye-witnesses in support of his case.    It is further observed that it\n\nmay be that if a large number of persons have witnessed the incident,\n\nit would be open to the prosecutor to make a selection of those\n\nwitnesses, but the selection must be made fairly and honestly and not\n\nwith a view to suppress inconvenient witnesses from the witness box.\n\nIt is further observed that if at the trial it is shown that the persons\n\nwho had witnessed the incident have been deliberately kept back, the\n\nCourt may draw an inference against the accused and may, in a\n\nproper case, record the failure of the prosecution to examine the said\n\nwitnesses as constituting a serious infirmity in the proof of the\n\nprosecution case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">10.5 Murder and rape is indeed a reprehensive act and every\n\nperpetrator should be punished expeditiously, severely and strictly.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">\f                                    66</span>\n\nHowever, this is only possible when guilt has been proved beyond\n\nreasonable doubt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\">10.6 The prosecution/investigating agency is expected to act in an\n\nhonest and fair manner without hiding anything from the accused as\n\nwell as the Courts, which may go against the prosecution.           Their\n\nultimate aim should not be to get conviction by hook or crook.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">11. Applying the aforesaid principles to the facts of the case on hand,\n\nwe are of the opinion that there was no fair and honest investigation\n\nand even prosecution tried to suppress the material fact from the\n\ncourt. In the present case, the investigating officer, PW13 – special\n\nexecutive magistrate and even PW8 – injured eye witness suppressed\n\nfrom the court the material fact of the statement of PW8 recorded on\n\n7.6.2003, recorded by PW13 -special executive magistrate in which\n\nshe specifically identified four persons who have committed the offence\n\nfrom the album of the photographs of the notorious criminals. Thus,\n\nspecial executive magistrate being an independent witness was\n\nsupposed to state the correct facts before the court. At this stage, it is\n\nrequired to be noted that PW13 – Ramesh Sonawane – Special\n\nExecutive Magistrate is the same Special Executive Magistrate who\n\nconducted the TI parade subsequently.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">11.1 Even the conduct on the part of the investigating officer in\n\nsuppressing the aforesaid fact from the court is required to be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">\f                                   67</span>\n\ncondemned. It appears that in fact the investigating officer and the\n\nprosecution deliberately withheld the aforesaid fact from the court.\n\nAccording to PW1 &amp; PW8, there were 7-8 persons who committed the\n\noffence. Though, PW12 – Vishnu Hagwane, nephew of the landlord –\n\nfirst person to reach the spot clearly stated in his deposition that PW1\n\ntold him that four persons were the assailants and committed the\n\noffence.   Be that as it may, according to PW1 &amp; PW8 and even\n\naccording to the prosecution, there were 7-8 persons who committed\n\nthe offence. PW8 identified four persons on 7.6.2003 from the album\n\nof the photographs of notorious criminals whose names were\n\nspecifically noted as per the statement of PW8. None of the accused in\n\nthe present case are out of those four persons identified by PW8 on\n\n7.6.2003. Therefore, if those four persons who were identified by PW8\n\nas other than the accused in the present case are added in the present\n\ncase, it can be said that there were 12 persons/assailants who\n\ncommitted the offence and therefore the prosecution case that there\n\nwere 7-8 persons would fail and that is why the aforesaid fact seems\n\nnot to have been stated by the investigating officer and the same was\n\nsuppressed by him deliberately and wilfully. Even the investigation\n\nalso does not seem to be fair and honest investigation. From the\n\nstatement of PW8 recorded by the special executive magistrate\n\nrecorded on 7.6.2003 in which she identified four named persons from\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">\f                                   68</span>\n\nthe album of the photographs of notorious criminals, nothing is on\n\nrecord whether those four persons were arrested or not or any further\n\ninvestigation was carried out with respect to those four persons. It is\n\nto be noted that none of the accused in the present case are out of\n\nthose four persons who were identified by PW8 on 7.6.2003, i.e.,\n\nimmediately after the incident. The investigating officer ought to have\n\nconducted an investigation on that line and ought to have arrested\n\nthose four persons and ought to have conducted the investigation qua\n\nthose four persons. On the contrary, the accused in the present case\n\nwere arrested after a period of one and a half months and that too on\n\ntransfer warrants, though there was no description of the accused\n\ngiven by either PW1 or PW8. A6 was arrested after a period of one and\n\na half year. It is to be noted that all the accused persons are nomadic\n\ntribes coming from the lower strata of the society and are very poor\n\nlabourers. Therefore, in the facts and circumstances of the case, false\n\nimplication cannot be ruled out since it is common occurrence that in\n\nserious offences sometime innocent persons are roped in. At the cost\n\nof the repetition, it is to be noted that there is no explanation\n\nwhatsoever why those four persons who were identified by PW8 on\n\n7.6.2003 were neither arrested nor there was any investigation qua\n\nthem.    Therefore, there is a serious lapse on the part of the\n\ninvestigating agency, which has affected the fair investigation and fair\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">\f                                   69</span>\n\ntrial, and therefore, we are of the opinion that the same is violative of\n\nfundamental rights of the accused guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_97\">Articles 20</a> <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_98\">&amp; 21</a>\n\nof the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">12. In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the\n\nconviction and sentence imposed by the High Court cannot be\n\nsustained. The prosecution has failed to prove the case against the\n\naccused beyond reasonable doubt.         Therefore, we have no other\n\nalternative, but to acquit the accused for the offences for which they\n\nare convicted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">13. At the same time, we cannot loose sight of the fact that five\n\npersons have been killed/murdered, out of whom even one lady was\n\nraped.   Therefore, it is the duty of the Court to see that the real\n\nculprits are booked and are punished. The Court cannot shut its eyes\n\nto the aforesaid fact that five persons have been killed/murdered and\n\nthat there is no fair investigation and because of the lapse on the part\n\nof the prosecution/investigating agency in not conducting any\n\ninvestigation qua those four persons who were identified by PW8 on\n\n7.6.2003 before the special executive magistrate. The benefit of the\n\nlapse in investigation and/or unfair investigation cannot be permitted\n\nto go to the persons who are real culprits and in fact who committed\n\nthe offence. As observed hereinabove, unfortunately, there was no\n\ninvestigation at all with respect to those four persons who were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">\f                                    70</span>\n\nidentified by PW8 in her statement on 7.6.2003.          It has come on\n\nrecord and as observed hereinabove, those four persons who were\n\nidentified by PW8 on 7.6.2003, which was just after two days’ of the\n\nincident, were other than the appellants – six persons who came to be\n\ntried. Therefore, we are of the opinion that this is a fit case for further\n\ninvestigation under <a href=\"/doc/274924/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 173(8)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure\n\nqua those four persons, who were identified by PW8 on 7.6.2003, the\n\nreference of whom is in the statement recorded by PW13.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">14. Now so far as the submission and prayer on behalf of the\n\naccused, not only to acquit them, but to award an adequate\n\ncompensation is concerned, it deserves consideration. From the above\n\nfacts and circumstances of the case, it has emerged that there was no\n\nfair investigation and fair trial and the fundamental rights of the\n\naccused guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_100\">Articles 20</a> <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_101\">&amp; 21</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia have been infringed. The investigation is not fair and honest.\n\nThere is no investigation at all qua the four persons who were\n\nidentified by PW8 on 7.6.2003. On the contrary, the accused in the\n\npresent case were nomadic tribes and falsely implicated and are roped\n\nin. Except one, all of them are in jail since last 16 years. All were\n\nfacing the hanging sword of death penalty.          Out of six accused\n\npersons, one was subsequently found to be a juvenile.          As per the\n\nreport of Dr. Ashit Sheth, a Psychiatrist, who examined one of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">\f                                  71</span>\n\naccused – Ankush Maruti Shinde, who was subsequently found to be\n\na juvenile, he has clearly opined that he has lived under sub-human\n\nconditions for several years.   He was kept in isolation in solitary\n\nconfinement with very restricted human contact and under perpetual\n\nfear of death. He was only allowed to meet his mother, and that too\n\nonly infrequently.   He was not even allowed to mix with other\n\nprisoners. Therefore, all the accused remained under constant stress\n\nand in the perpetual fear of death.    As they were facing the death\n\npenalty, they might not have availed any other facilities of parole,\n\nfurlon etc. All of them who were between the age of 25-30 years (and\n\none of the accused was a juvenile) have lost their valuable years of\n\ntheir life in jail. Their family members have also suffered. Therefore,\n\nin the facts and circumstances of the case, and in exercise of our\n\npowers under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India, we direct the\n\nState of Maharashtra to pay a sum of Rs.5,00,000/- to each of the\n\naccused by way of compensation, to be deposited by the State with the\n\nlearned Sessions Court within a period of four weeks from today and\n\non such deposit, the same be paid to the concerned accused on proper\n\nidentification. The learned Sessions Court is directed to see that the\n\nsaid amount shall be used for their rehabilitation. At the cost of the\n\nrepetition, it is observed that the aforesaid compensation is awarded\n\nto the accused and in the peculiar facts and circumstances of the case\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">\f                                   72</span>\n\nand in exercise of powers under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_103\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of\n\nIndia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"24057125\" id=\"span_81\">15. Before parting with the present order, we strongly deprecate the\n\nconduct on the part of the investigating agency and the prosecution.\n\nBecause of such lapses, and more particularly in not conducting the\n\ninvestigation insofar as those four persons who were identified by PW8\n\non 7.6.2003, the real culprits have gone out of the clutches of the law\n\nand got scot free. At this stage, the decision of this Court in the case\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/24057125/\" id=\"a_104\">State of Gujarat v. Kishanbhai</a> (2014) 5 SCC 108 is required to be\n\nreferred to, in which this Court has directed in paragraphs 22 and 23\n\nas under:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">              “22.

Likewise, every acquittal should\n         ordinarily lead to the inference, that an innocent person\n         was wrongfully prosecuted. It is therefore essential that\n         every State should put in place a procedural mechanism\n         which would ensure that the cause of justice is served,\n         which would simultaneously ensure the safeguard of\n         interest of those who are innocent.

We\nfurther direct, that the above training programme be put\nin place within 6 months. This would ensure that those\npersons who handle sensitive matters concerning\ninvestigation/prosecution are fully trained to handle the\nsame. Thereupon, if any lapses are committed by them,\nthey would not be able to feign innocence when they are\nmade liable to suffer departmental action for their\nlapses.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">     23. On the culmination of a criminal case in\nacquittal, the concerned investigating/prosecuting\nofficial(s) responsible for such acquittal must necessarily\nbe identified. A finding needs to be recorded in each\ncase, whether the lapse was innocent or blameworthy.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"24057125\" id=\"span_84\">Each erring officer must suffer the consequences of his\nlapse, by appropriate departmental action, whenever\ncalled for. Taking into consideration the seriousness of\nthe matter, the official concerned may be withdrawn\nfrom investigative responsibilities, permanently or\ntemporarily, depending purely on his culpability. We\nalso feel compelled to require the adoption of some\nindispensable measures, which may reduce the malady\nsuffered by parties on both sides of criminal litigation.\nAccordingly, we direct the Home Department of every\nState Government, to formulate a procedure for taking\naction against all erring investigating/prosecuting\nofficials/officers. All such erring officials/officers\nidentified, as responsible for failure of a prosecution\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">\f                                      74</span>\n\n         case, on account of sheer negligence or because of\n         culpable lapses, must suffer departmental action. The\n         above mechanism formulated would infuse seriousness\n         in the performance of investigating and prosecuting\n         duties, and would ensure that investigation and\n         prosecution are purposeful and decisive.
