Harpal Singh (PW-1) in his statement (Ex-PA)\n\nhas stated that he is a resident of Village Badauchi Kalan, Police Station Sirhind,\n\nDistt. Fatehgarh Sahib. He had since 1995 opened a transport company in the name\n\nof B.S. Rehal at Amloh Road, Mandi Gobindgarh. On 15.03.2001 he received a\n\ntelephone call from Vishal Bansal (PW-9) proprietor of Vijay Steel Corporation\n\nOverlock Road, Ludhiana that they need a truck to take iron goods from Gobindgarh\n\nto Ludhiana. They, therefore, asked for a truck being sent. Complainant Harpal Singh\n\n(PW-1) on their asking sent Shingara Singh, driver (PW2) with a truck from his\n\ntransport company bearing registration No.PUR 3743 to the Bansal Steel Rolling\n\nMill, G.T. Road Sirhind side Gobindgarh. There Vishal Bansal (PW-9) from different\n\nmills got loaded iron Girder, Angle, Rods, Pati (strips), Chakor etc. and gave the bills\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                         -3-</span>\n\n\n\nregarding purchase of iron goods from different mills to Shingara Singh, driver\n\n(PW-2) and Vishal Bansal (PW9) himself left for Ludhiana. These goods were to be\n\ntaken to Ludhiana Steel Corporation. On 17.03.2001 at about 6.00 a.m. Vishal\n\nBansal (PW-9) on telephone rang up the complainant-Harpal Singh (PW-1) and\n\ninformed him that the truck that he had got loaded with goods had not reached there.\n\nOn this Vishal Bansal (PW-9) reached Gobindgarh and they i.e. Harpal Singh (PW-1)\n\nand Vishal Bansal (PW-9) searched for driver Shingara Singh (PW-2) and the truck.\n\nShingara Singh (PW-9) the driver of the truck then met them at 9.00 a.m. and he told\n\nthem that on 16.3.2001 in the evening he had parked the loaded truck near Allahabad\n\nBank and he (Shingara Singh) himself went to his house and he left his elder brother\n\nMukhtiar Singh (deceased) with the truck. Shingara Singh (PW-2) further informed\n\nthat on 17.3.2001 when he reached Allahabad Bank in the morning at about 3.00 a.m.\n\nfor taking the truck to Ludhiana, he found that the truck and his brother were missing.\n\nAfter making a search for the truck, the driver Shingara Singh (PW-2) informed\n\nHarpal Singh (PW2) on telephone at about 6.00 a.m. The loaded weight of goods in\n\nthe truck was 13 tonnes one quintal. They had till that time searched for the truck\n\nquite substantially in their own manner but nothing could be ascertained.       Harpal\n\nSingh (PW1) had full doubt that Shingara Singh, driver (PW-2) had in connivance\n\nwith his brother embezzled the material loaded in the truck and had committed mis-\n\nappropriation. Harpal Singh (PW-1) at that time along with the owner of the goods\n\nVishal Bansal (PW-9) were going to inform about the incident when the police met\n\nthem near Lal Batian Wala Chowk, G.T. Road, Mandi Gobindgarh and recorded his\n\nstatement. Legal action was requested to be taken. The statement (Ex.PA) was\n\nsigned by Harpal Singh (PW1) in English. ASI Joga Singh (PW-18) recorded the\n\nstatement (Ex.PA) and the police proceedings (Ex.PA/1). The statement was read over\n\nand explained to the complainant-Harpal Singh (PW-1). From the said statement, an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                      -4-</span>\n\n\n\noffence in terms of <a href=\"/doc/988620/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 406</a> and <a href=\"/doc/940928/\" id=\"a_7\">407</a> IPC was found to be made out.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">            ASI Joga Singh (PW-18), after recording the statement (Ex-PA) of the\n\ncomplainant Harpal Singh (PW-1) made his endorsement (Ex.PA/1) and sent the same\n\nfor registration of FIR and on its basis formal FIR (Ex.PA/2) was recorded by SI/SHO\n\nBachhitar Singh (PW-17). Then he (ASI Joga Singh) went to the spot from where the\n\ntruck was stolen and prepared site plan (Ex.PW18/A) with correct marginal notes.\n\nHe recorded the statement of Vishal Bansal (PW-9) and other PWs. On 18.03.2001,\n\nShingara Singh (PW-2) was produced by Avtar Singh (PW-8) and Baldev Singh\n\n(PW-12). Joga Singh ASI (PW18) recorded the statements of witnesses and produced\n\nShingara Singh (PW-2) before SHO Sukhdev Singh          (PW-10).    Shingara Singh\n\n(PW-2) was let off being innocent. On 19.03.2001, he (ASI Joga Singh) along with\n\nSHO Sukhdev Singh (PW10) and other police officials were present at Batian Wala\n\nChowk, Gobindgarh where Avtar Singh (appellant in CRA No.D-452-DB of 2004)\n\nwas produced before SHO Sukhdev Singh (PW10) by Parminder Singh, Lambardar\n\n(PW-16).   Avtar Singh (appellant) was interrogated and he made a disclosure\n\nstatement before SHO Sukhdev Singh (PW10) that he (Avtar Singh-appellant)\n\nalongwith Karnail Singh (appellant in CRA No.D-406-DB of 2004) had concealed\n\nthe dead body of Mukhtiar Singh (deceased) in the area of Village Mohanpur near\n\nChuna Bhathi under the grass and only he had knowledge about it.

Parminder Singh (PW16) who had produced\n\nAvtar Singh (appellant) before SHO Sukhdev Singh (PW10) disclosed that the\n\naccused (Avtar Singh) had made an extra-judicial confession before him regarding\n\nthe murder of Mukhtiar Singh. The detailed statement of Parminder Singh (PW16)\n\nwithout any addition or omission was recorded by SHO Sukhdev Singh (PW10).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">            On 23.03.2001 ASI Joga Singh (PW-18) was accompanying SI/SHO\n\nBachhittar Singh (PW-17) and was present at the police station. SI/SHO Bachhittar\n\nSingh (PW-17) received secret information about Karnail Singh (appellant). Karnail\n\nSingh (appellant) was arrested by SI/SHO Bachhittar Singh (PW-17) near the Octroi\n\nPost Bhadla.    He (Karnail Singh-appellant) was interrogated and he made a\n\ndisclosure statement (Ex.PW5/A) regarding concealment of truck bearing registration\n\nNo.PUR 3743. On the basis of his disclosure statement the said truck was recovered\n\nfrom the disclosed place given in memo Ex.PW5/A i.e. from the open place near\n\nDana Mandi. A memo (Ex.PW5/C) of personal search was also prepared. All these\n\nmemos were signed by ASI Joga Singh (PW-18) and Bhagwan Singh (PW-5).          On\n\n25.03.2001 the accused (Karnail Singh-appellant) who was already in custody of SI\n\nBachhittar Singh (PW-17) was interrogated in the presence of ASI Joga Singh\n\n(PW-18) and Shingara Singh (PW-2). He made a disclosure statement that he had\n\nconcealed the iron goods loaded in truck bearing No. PUR 3743 near the minor canal\n\nin the bushes. His statement (Ex.PB) was recorded, which was signed by the accused\n\nand attested by ASI Joga Singh (PW-18) and Shingara Singh (PW2).

The\n\nstatements of other witnesses were also recorded. After completion of investigation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                       -6-</span>\n\n\n\nthe challan was filed in the Court of the Ilaqa Magistrate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">             In view of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 302</a> IPC being alleged, the case was\n\ncommitted to the Court of Session for trial.         The learned Sessions Judge on\n\n28.08.2001 charged the appellants namely Karnail Singh and Avtar Singh on the\n\nallegations that on 15.03.2001 in the area of Gobindgarh they both intentionally\n\ncommitted murder of Mukhtiar Singh and thereby committed an offence punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 302</a> IPC.      Besides, on the same date, time and place, they both\n\nknowing that murder of Mukhtiar Singh had been committed which is punishable\n\nwith death caused certain evidence connected with this offence to disappear and took\n\nthe dead body of Mukhtiar Singh from the place of his murder and concealed it under\n\nthe grass and shrubs in the area near Lime-Kiln in the area of Village Libra with\n\nintention to screen themselves from legal punishment and thereby they both\n\ncommitted an offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 201</a> IPC. Lastly, on the same date,\n\ntime and place both they both (appellants) intended to dishonestly take truck No.PUR\n\n3743 along with iron loaded in it out of the possession of Mukhtiar Singh without his\n\nconsent and moved it in order to take it away and thereby committed an offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1101188/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 379</a> IPC. All the said offences were within the cognizance\n\nof the learned Sessions Judge and the accused (appellants) were directed to be tried\n\nby the said Court of the aforesaid charges. The appellants had heard the charges and\n\npleaded not guilty to the same and claimed trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">             The prosecution in order to establish its case examined as many as 18\n\nwitnesses; besides tendered documents in evidence. The statements of the appellants\n\nin terms of <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure (<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_13\">Cr.P.C</a>.-for short) were\n\nrecorded. Karnail Singh (appellant) in his defence stated that he was innocent. It\n\nwas stated that Mukhtiar Singh (deceased) was habitually addicted to various types of\n\ndrugs. He had died under some mysterious circumstances. The police had fabricated\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                       -7-</span>\n\n\n\nand concocted the papers relating to the loading of iron goods in the truck. They\n\nwere kept in illegal custody for several days by the police and beaten mercilessly to\n\nplease the complainant party and later on the whole evidence had been fabricated and\n\nrecoveries had been planted on them for their false implication for the reasons known\n\nto the police. Avtar Singh (appellant) in his defence took the same stand as that of\n\nKarnail Singh (appellant). No evidence was lead by the appellants in defence. The\n\nlearned Sessions Judge, Fatehgarh Sahib after considering the evidence and material\n\non record convicted the appellants Karnail Singh and Avtar Singh for the offences\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_14\">Sections 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_15\">201</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1101188/\" id=\"a_16\">379</a> IPC. Both the appellants have been sentenced to\n\nimprisonment for life, besides, pay a fine of `250/- each and in default thereof, to\n\nundergo R.I for two months each, for the commission of the offence punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 302</a> IPC. They have also been sentenced to undergo RI for 3 years each,\n\nbesides, pay a fine of `200/- each and in default thereof, to undergo RI for 2 months\n\neach, for the commission of the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 201</a> IPC. They\n\nhave also been sentenced to undergo RI for one year each for the commission of the\n\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1101188/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 379</a> IPC. All the sentences were, however, ordered\n\nto run concurrently. Aggrieved against the judgment and order dated 19.02.2004\n\npassed by the learned Sessions Judge, Fatehgarh Sahib, the present appeals have been\n\nfiled in this Court seeking setting aside of the judgment of conviction and order of\n\nsentence dated 19.02.2004 passed by learned Sessions Judge, Fatehgarh Sahib.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">            Mr. S.S. Rangi, Advocate learned counsel for the appellants has\n\nsubmitted that the case is one of a blind murder of Mukhtiar Singh, brother of\n\nShingara Singh (PW-2), during the intervening night of 16/17.03.2001.            It is\n\nsubmitted that the case is based only on circumstantial evidence which in the facts\n\nand circumstances does not establish the guilt of the appellants beyond shadow of\n\ndoubt. It is submitted that Parminder Singh (PW-16), who was the lambardar and is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                          -8-</span>\n\n\n\nsaid to have produced Avtar Singh (appellant) before SHO Sukhdev Singh (PW10) on\n\n19.03.2001, was declared hostile and he did not support the prosecution case.\n\nBesides, it is submitted that the appellants had no motive to commit the murder of\n\nMukhtiar Singh.    It is also submitted that Avtar Singh (PW-8), who is said to have\n\nlast seen Mukhtiar Singh (deceased) with the appellants is a chance witness and it\n\nwould be entirely unsafe to rely on the testimony of a chance witness. It is submitted\n\nthat the recovery of iron goods with the truck was from the disclosed place and in any\n\ncase nothing was recovered from Avtar Singh (appellant) so as to establish his\n\ninvolvement with the crime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">             Mr. S.S. Gill, Addl. Advocate General, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nState of Punjab has submitted that the prosecution has proved its case against the\n\nappellants beyond shadow of reasonable doubt. Besides, the facts and circumstances\n\nof the case point only to the guilt of the appellants and there is nothing to show that\n\nthey have been falsely implicated. It is submitted that the prosecution evidence\n\ncompletes the chain of circumstances which points only to the guilt of the appellants\n\nand rules out any possibility of their innocence. From the evidence and material on\n\nrecord the learned trial Court, it is submitted, recorded a firm finding of conviction\n\nagainst the appellants and sentenced them which would not warrant any interference\n\nby this Court. It is submitted that Avtar Singh (PW-8) though may be a chance\n\nwitness but he was driving his truck and had parked it at a &#x27;dhabha&#x27; near village\n\nBhatian, beyond Khanna, District Ludhiana when he saw the appellants in truck\n\nNo.PUR 3743 loaded with iron material. Therefore, for truck drivers to meet at a\n\n&#x27;dhaba&#x27; in the area is quite normal. In the present case the truck was that of his close\n\nrelative i.e. his mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s husband (massar). Therefore, there was no difficulty\n\nfor Avtar Singh (PW-8) to identify the truck and ascertain as to who was driving it.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">             We have given our thoughtful consideration to the contentions of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                          -9-</span>\n\n\n\nlearned counsel appearing for the parties and with their assistance have gone through\n\nthe records of the case. The case was initially registered on the basis of statement of\n\nHarpal Singh (PW-1) who received a telephone message from Vishal Bansal (PW-9),\n\nwho is proprietor of Vijay Steel Corporation, Overlock Road, Ludhiana that they\n\nneed a truck to take some iron goods from Mandi Gobindgarh to Ludhiana on the\n\nnext morning. Vishal Bansal (PW-9) appeared in the witness box and stated that he\n\nwas trading with iron and steel at Ludhiana and the name of their firm was Vijay\n\nSteel Corporation. On 15.03.2001 he telephoned to Harpal Singh (PW-1), proprietor\n\nof B.S. Rehal Transport Company for supplying one truck, which was required for\n\ntransporting iron and steel from Gobindgarh.       Truck no.PUR 3743 was sent to\n\nGobindgarh which was being driven by Shingara Singh (PW-2). Vishal Bansal\n\n(PW-9) gave instructions to load iron from Bansal Iron and Steel Rolling Mills, Raj\n\nSteel Rolling Mills and Malwa Iron and Steel Co. Ltd. at Gobindgarh.                On\n\n15.03.2001 iron was loaded from two mills while from the third mill it was loaded\n\non 16.03.2001. The truck loaded with iron was to be received by their firm at\n\nLudhiana on 17.03.2001. However, the goods did not reach him (Vishal Bansal, PW-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">9) on 17.03.2001. Therefore, in the morning he (Vishal Bansal, PW-9) rang the\n\nowner of the truck (Harpal Singh, PW-1) and informed him about the matter. At\n\nabout 6.15 a.m. Shingara Singh (PW-2) driver of the truck also rang him (Vishal\n\nBansal, PW-9) and informed that he had parked the truck outside Allahabad Bank\n\nMandi Gobindgarh and his brother Mukhtiar Singh (deceased) was in the vehicle\n\nalong with &#x27;billties&#x27; (consignment receipts) and bills. After receipt of this message he\n\n(Vishal Bansal, PW-9) reached Gobindgarh at 9.15 a.m. and met Harpal Singh\n\n(PW-1), owner of the truck. He (Vishal Bansal, PW-9) and Harpal Singh (PW-1)\n\nsearched for driver Shingara Singh (PW-2), however, they could not find him. Upon\n\nthis they got suspicious that Shingara Singh (PW-2) had misappropriated the iron and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                        -10-</span>\n\n\n\nsteel loaded in the truck. They then met ASI Joga Singh (PW18) and produced\n\nbefore him duplicate copies of bills. ASI Joga Singh (PW-18) recorded the statement\n\n(Ex.PA) of Harpal Singh (PW-1) on the basis of which FIR (Ex.PA/2) was registered.\n\nHis (Vishal Bansal, PW-9) statement was also recorded. Iron and steel was recovered\n\nby the police later on, which he (Vishal Bansal, PW-9) took on &#x27;sapurdari&#x27;\n\n(entrustment of case property during trial). The iron taken into possession was lying\n\nin their factory, which being heavy could not be produced in the Court on the date he\n\nwas deposing i.e. on 26.02.2003. The case property was produced on a subsequent\n\ndate i.e. 11.06.2003 and he (Vishal Bansal, PW-9) stated that it was the same, which\n\nwas taken on &#x27;sapurdari&#x27;. Vishal Bansal (PW-9) was cross examined at length by the\n\ndefence. In cross-examination it is inter alia stated that on 17.03.2001 the goods did\n\nnot reach them and a telephone message was received early in the morning at 4/5.00\n\na.m. from Shingara Singh (PW-2) driver of the concerned truck that the truck was\n\nparked at some place, however, the same was not traceable. He (Vishal Bansal PW-9)\n\nreached Gobindgarh at 9.00 am on 17.03.2001. First of all he contacted Baldev\n\nSingh (PW-12) (owner of truck No.PUR 3743) and Harpal Singh, complainant\n\n(PW-1) (Transporter). Thereafter, the matter was reported to the Police. The police\n\nstarted collecting information and made enquiries from many persons. Vishal Bansal\n\n(PW-9) along with Harpal Singh (PW-1), Baldev Singh (PW-12), Shingara Singh\n\n(PW-2) and Avtar Singh (PW-8) remained sitting in the Police Station. Avtar Singh\n\n(PW-8), Baldev Singh (PW-12) and Harpal Singh (PW-1) it is stated are all related to\n\neach other. The police registered the case at about 5.00 p.m on 17.03.2001. Till that\n\ntime no clue regarding the truck was available. The police had also interrogated\n\nShingara Singh (PW-2) driver before registration of the case. Therefore, it may be\n\nnoticed that it is indeed from the deposition of Harpal Singh (PW-1) and Vishal\n\nBansal (PW-9) that the truck of M/s B.S. Rehal Transport Company was engaged by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                       -11-</span>\n\n\n\nVishal Bansal (PW-9) for taking iron material from Gobindgarh to Ludhiana. The\n\niron material was to be collected from three mills. Iron was loaded from two mills on\n\n15.03.2011 and was loaded from the third mill on 16.03.2001. The truck was to reach\n\nat Ludhiana on 17.03.2001 but it did not reach.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">            Harpal Singh (PW-1) while appearing in the witness box has stated that\n\nhe had been running a transport company in the name of B.S. Rehal. On 15.3.2001\n\nhe let out the truck bearing registration No.PUR 3743 to Vishal Bansal (PW9) of\n\nLudhiana for taking iron material from Mandi Gobindgarh to Ludhiana. It is stated\n\nthat the truck bearing registration No.PUR 3743 belongs to his transport company,\n\nwhich was owned by Baldev Singh (PW-12) and was sent through driver Shingara\n\nSingh (PW-2) for taking the iron material from Mandi Gobindgarh to Ludhiana in\n\ncompliance with the orders (sic. requirement) of Vishal Bansal (PW-9). The driver\n\nShingara Singh (PW-2) got the iron bars and other material of iron loaded from\n\ndifferent mills as asked by the trader. The total weight of load was 13 tonnes. The\n\ntruck was to depart from Mandi Gobindgarh in the evening of 15.03.2001 and was to\n\nreach on the next night. In fact the truck was loaded on 16.03.2001 in the evening\n\nand it was to start at night and was to reach at Ludhiana early in the morning. He\n\n(Harpal Singh PW-1) received a telephone message from Vishal Bansal (PW-9) that\n\nthe truck in which iron goods and other material were loaded had not reached\n\nLudhiana. He (Harpal Singh PW-1) was asked to verify in this regard. The trader\n\nalso reached Mandi Gobindgarh in the morning of 17.03.2001 and narrated to Harpal\n\nSingh, (PW-1) that the truck had not reached Ludhiana.        Harpal Singh (PW-1)\n\nreceived a message on telephone at 6.00 a.m. and he verified from the truck driver\n\nShingara Singh (PW-2) who informed him (Harpal Singh PW-1) that at about 9.00\n\na.m. (sic. 9.00 p.m.) he had parked the truck near Allahabad Bank after loading the\n\nsame and as he was tired, he asked his brother (Mukhtiar Singh-deceased) to remain\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                        -12-</span>\n\n\n\nnear the truck and after his arrival, driver Shingara Singh (PW2) went to his house\n\nfor taking rest. When Shingara Singh (PW-2), came to the truck for taking the same\n\nto Ludhiana, the truck and his brother (Mukhtiar Singh-deceased) were not available.\n\nHe (Shingara Singh PW-2) searched for the truck and his brother for whole of the\n\nnight and he also went to the police station in this regard but the truck could not be\n\ntraced. Thereafter, Harpal Singh (PW-1) in the evening reported the matter to the\n\npolice. His statement (Ex.PA) was recorded which was read over and explained to\n\nhim and he signed it in token of its correctness. Harpal Singh (PW-1) was also cross-\n\nexamined by the defence. It is inter alia stated that on 17.3.2001, Vishal Bansal\n\n(PW-9) the owner of the goods came to him (Harpal Singh-PW1) at 9.00 a.m. and\n\nShingar Singh (PW-2) driver had met them at 9.30 a.m. Avtar Singh (PW8), it is\n\nstated never met them in the course of investigation for searching the truck and he\n\nmet them in the evening on 17.3.2001. Avtar Singh (PW8) it is stated had met him\n\nbefore lodging the FIR and again said he met him after his statement was recorded.\n\nAvtar Singh (PW-8) it is stated met him at 9.00 p.m. while they were going to their\n\nhouse. Avtar Singh (PW8) did not tell them anything about this occurrence on\n\n17.3.2001 when he met him (Harpal Singh PW-1). On 17.3.2001 they suspected that\n\nShingara Singh (PW2) and his brother Mukhtiar Singh (deceased) had taken the truck\n\nto some where else and had misappropriated the goods and a report was lodged\n\nagainst them. On 19.3.2001 they did not know about the whereabouts of Mukhtiar\n\nSingh (deceased).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">            Avtar Singh (PW-8) is a material witness in this case and in his\n\ndeposition he has stated that he is the owner of truck No.PB-11 J 2380 and he drives\n\nthe said truck himself. On 16.03.2001, he brought sand on the above-said truck. At\n\nabout 11.00 p.m., he parked his truck near a &#x27;dhaba&#x27; near Khanna, near Village\n\nBhatian beyond Khanna, Distt. Ludhiana.          In the meantime a truck bearing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                       -13-</span>\n\n\n\nregistration No. PUR 3743 which belongs to his mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s husband (massar)\n\ncame there and it stopped. He (Avtar Singh PW-8) thought that the truck driver had\n\nstopped the truck on seeing him then he went near the truck and saw that accused\n\nKarnail Singh (appellant) was driving the truck and accused Avtar Singh (appellant)\n\nwas sitting on the conductor seat. He knew both the accused as he used to meet them\n\nat Transport Company, Gobindgarh. He also saw Shingara Singh (PW-2) who was\n\nthe actual driver of truck No. PUR 3743. The truck was loaded with iron material.\n\nOn seeing him (Avtar Singh PW-8), both the accused (Karnail Singh and Avtar Singh)\n\ntook truck no. PUR 3743 towards Ludhiana. He (Avtar Singh PW-8) thought that\n\nShingara Singh (PW-2) might have become ill and due to that reason Karnail Singh\n\n(appellant) might have been sent as the driver on the truck. Next day he (Avtar\n\nSingh PW-8) came to know that the above-said truck i.e. PUR 3743 was stolen. He\n\ndisclosed the said fact to his mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s husband (Baldev Singh PW-12) that he\n\nsaw accused Karnail Singh and Avtar Singh (appellants) taking the truck towards\n\nLudhiana. His statement was recorded by the police. Avtar Singh (PW-8) in his\n\ncross-examination stated that on 17.03.2001 a telephonic message about the theft of\n\nthe truck was received at about 10/11.00 a.m. and he (Avtar Singh PW-8) on\n\ntelephone stated that he had seen the truck moving towards Ludhiana with Karnail\n\nSingh and Avtar Singh (appellants). He had come to Gobindgarh on 18.03.2001 and\n\nhe did not come to Gobindgarh on 17.03.2001. Harpal Singh (PW-1) belongs to\n\nVillage Badauchhi and was his (Avtar Singh PW-8) brother-in-law i.e. husband of his\n\nwife&#x27;s sister. He had two trucks which were attached with the Union of Nabha and\n\nGobindgarh. During the days of occurrence he (Avtar Singh PW-8) had been residing\n\nin Gobindgarh and had been coming to the Union. Again said there was no Union of\n\nTransport. His brother in law (Harpal Singh PW-1) was also having trucks in the\n\ntransport at Gobindgarh. Baldev Singh (PW-12) was also having trucks and his truck\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                      -14-</span>\n\n\n\nwas stolen. On the day of occurrence he (Avtar Singh PW-8) had loaded sand from\n\nKohara and was going to Nabha. He was not in possession of receipts etc. The sand\n\nwas filled from the fields and it is stated to be sold in the Truck Union at Nabha.\n\nAfter parking the truck in the Union, they go to their house. He had reached the\n\n&#x27;dhaba&#x27; at 11.00 p.m. The &#x27;dhaba&#x27; was on the left side of the road when one comes\n\nfrom Ludhiana. He was not in possession of the receipt regarding selling of the sand\n\nat Nabha. On that day he had carried/uploaded iron rods at Ludhiana and on his way\n\nback he loaded sand. Harpal Singh (PW-1) had not met him on 17.03.2001 at Mandi\n\nGobindgarh at any time. After receiving of telephone, no other message had been\n\ntaken on 17.03.2001. He (Avtar Singh PW-8) had disclosed every thing on\n\n17.03.2001 to Baldev Singh (PW12). He had no information regarding the dead body\n\nof Mukhtiar Singh. He did not remember the day when he came to know about the\n\ndead body of Mukhtiar Singh, may be it was of 18th and 19th of that month. He had\n\nnot searched the dead body of Mukhtiar Singh. He had no information regarding\n\nsearch of dead body. Baldev Singh (PW-12) etc. might had done it. His statement\n\nwas recorded on 18.03.2001 by ASI Joga Singh (PW-18) at about noon.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">            Baldev Singh (PW-12) also appeared in the witness box and stated that\n\nhe was owner of truck bearing registration No.PUR 3743. This truck was being plied\n\nat Gobindgarh. Shingara Singh (PW-2) was working as driver on the above said\n\ntruck. Shingara Singh (PW-2) loaded the above said truck with iron and steel from\n\nGobindgarh which was to be taken to Ludhiana. He (Shingara Singh PW-2) parked\n\nhis truck near Allahabad Bank, Gobindgarh. He (Shingara Singh PW-2) had gone to\n\nhis house after leaving his brother Mukhtiar Singh (deceased) near the truck.\n\nAccused had taken his truck along with the iron material and had killed Mukhtiar\n\nSingh brother of Shingara Singh (PW-2). On 19.03.2001, he (Baldev Singh PW-12)\n\nidentified the dead body of Mukhtiar Singh. His statement was recorded. In his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                         -15-</span>\n\n\n\ncross-examination he stated that only Shingara Singh (PW-2) was driver of his truck,\n\nwhich was without a cleaner. Mukhtiar Singh (deceased) was not working as cleaner\n\non his truck. He was told by Shingara Singh (PW-2) on 16.03.2001 that his truck had\n\nbeen stolen. It was at night time. On next morning i.e 17.03.2001, he (Baldev Singh\n\nPW-12) met Shingara Singh (PW-2) at about 6/7.00 a.m. Shingara Singh (PW-2)\n\ninformed him at about 3/4.00 a.m. on 17.03.2001 about the theft on telephone. They\n\nsearched for truck up to Ludhiana and even up to Jalandhar on all the octroi posts.\n\nHe did not inform his relatives. His (Baldev Singh PW-12) son-in-law Harpal Singh\n\n(PW-1) and his son Balkar Singh were also with him. Vishal Bansal (PW-9) came\n\nand joined them in the evening on 17.03.2001 at about 6.00 p.m. Harpal Singh\n\n(PW-1), his son-in-law of Badocchi also came to him at 6/7.00 a.m. on 17.03.2001. It\n\nis stated that Avtar Singh (PW-8) of village Galwati is the son-in-law of the sister of\n\nhis wife. He (Avtar Singh PW-8) owns two trucks at Gobindgarh with them. He\n\n(Avtar Singh PW-8) plies his trucks from Gobindgarh and daily comes to\n\nGobindgarh. Avtar Singh (PW-8) did not meet him on 17.03.2001. After learning\n\nabout the theft of truck they did not report the matter to the police and they left for\n\nsearch of truck. Again said that they had informed the police of Gobindgarh on\n\n17.03.2001 in the morning but they told them to search for the truck on their own.\n\nThey did not search for the truck around the area of Mandi Gobindgarh. They had\n\ngone only on G.T. Road towards Ludhiana. They searched the truck in Ludhiana\n\nCity, Focal Point, and all the octroi posts of Ludhiana. They kept on searching the\n\ntruck up to 9/10.00 p.m. on 17.03.2001 but they did not get any clue. The police\n\nrecorded their report on 17.03.2001 at 6/7 a.m then said they orally informed the\n\npolice but their report was not recorded. They met the police after 9/10 p.m. when\n\nthey could not find any clue about their truck and goods. He (Baldev Singh PW-12)\n\ndid not lodge FIR and the FIR was not lodged in his presence. FIR was got recorded\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                        -16-</span>\n\n\n\nby his son-in-law Harpal Singh (PW-1) and at that time he (Baldev Singh PW-12)\n\nwas not present there. He could not say whether the FIR was got recorded on\n\n18.03.2001 or not. His truck was detected on 18.03.2001 from the grain market of\n\nMandi Gobindgarh.      The iron goods were loaded in the truck at that time on\n\n18.03.2001 but some goods were missing. He did not remember the weight of the\n\ngoods then again said it was 13/14 tonnes. The accused were arrested on 18.03.2001\n\nalong with the truck. They learnt from the accused about the death of Mukhtiar\n\nSingh on 18.03.2001. They did not search for the dead body. The accused were\n\narrested from the place in the grain market from where the truck and goods were\n\nrecovered. Avtar Singh (PW8) remained with them and he met them on 18.03.2001.\n\nThe accused were not yet arrested when Avtar Singh (PW8) had met them. It was\n\nwrong to state that the accused had been falsely implicated in this case and his\n\nrelation Avtar Singh (PW8) had been made a false witness in this case to fill up the\n\nlacuna. It was also wrong to state that the accused were active members of the\n\nLabour Union of Mandi Gobindgarh and there had been quarrel between the truck\n\ntransporters of Mandi Gobindgarh and Labour Union of Gobindgarh and due to this\n\nthe accused had been falsely implicated in this case by them in connivance with the\n\npolice. He (Baldev Singh PW-12) did not disclose to the police regarding the\n\nrecovery of truck and material. It was wrong to suggest that he was deposing falsely.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">            The learned trial Court has observed that Avtar Singh (PW-8) is a\n\nmaterial witness of last seen. It may, however, be noticed that Avtar Singh (PW-8) in\n\nhis statement stated that on 16.03.2001 he brought sand on his truck bearing No.PB\n\n11 J 2380 and at about 11.00 p.m. when he parked his truck near a &#x27;dhaba&#x27; near\n\nKhanna, near Village Bhatian beyond Khanna, he saw truck bearing registration\n\nNo.PUR 3743, belonging to his mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s husband i.e. Baldev Singh (PW-12).\n\nBesides, when he went near the truck, he saw the two accused (appellants). He also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                      -17-</span>\n\n\n\nsaw Shingara Singh (PW-2) who he says was the actual driver of the truck No. PUR\n\n3743. Accused-Karnail Singh was driving the truck and accused-Avtar Singh was\n\nsitting on the conductor seat. He knew them from earlier as he used to meet them at\n\nTransport Company Gobindgarh. It is pertinent to note that Avtar Singh (PW-8) does\n\nnot state that he saw Mukhtiar Singh (deceased) with them. It is nowhere mentioned\n\nin his statement that he saw Mukhtiar Singh (deceased) with the appellants.\n\nTherefore, evidence of last seen of Mukhtiar Singh (deceased) with the appellants is\n\nnot established and it does not stand proved that Mukhtiar Singh (deceased) was last\n\nseen with the appellants. Besides, Avtar Singh (PW-8) also states that on the next\n\nday i.e. 17.03.2001, he came to know that the above said truck (PUR 3743) had been\n\nstolen and he disclosed this fact to his mother&#x27;s sister&#x27;s husband (Baldev Singh\n\nPW-12), who was the owner of the said truck. In cross-examination, it is stated by\n\nAvtar Singh (PW-8) that on 17.03.2001 a telephonic message about the theft of the\n\ntruck No.PUR 3743 was received at about 10/11.00 a.m. and he on telephone stated\n\nthat he had seen the truck moving towards Ludhiana with Karnail Singh and Avtar\n\nSingh (appellants).   In further cross-examination he states that after receiving\n\ntelephonic message, no other message had been taken on 17.03.2001. He disclosed\n\neverything on 17.03.2001 to Baldev Singh (PW-12). It is also stated by Avtar Singh\n\n(PW-8) that he had no information regarding the dead body of Mukhtiar Singh.\n\nBaldev Singh (PW-12), who is the owner of the truck No.PUR 3743 does not state in\n\nhis deposition that Avtar Singh (PW-8) had informed him on 17.03.2001 about the\n\ntheft of the truck and Karnail Singh and Avtar Singh (appellants) were taking the\n\ntruck towards Ludhiana. Rather in cross-examination, it is stated by Baldev Singh\n\n(PW-12) that they had searched for the truck up to 9/10.00 p.m. on 17.03.2001 but\n\nthey did not get any clue. In fact according to Avtar Singh (PW-8) an information\n\nwas given on 17.03.2001 at about 10/11.00 a.m. that the truck was seen going\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                         -18-</span>\n\n\n\ntowards Ludhiana near a &#x27;dhaba&#x27; near Khanna, near Village Bhatian beyond Khanna\n\non 16.03.2001. Therefore, if this was so there was no reason for Baldev Singh\n\n(PW-12) to say that he did not get any clue about the truck till 9/10.00 p.m. on\n\n17.03.2001. As such, the possibility of Avtar Singh (PW-8) not seeing the truck at all\n\ncan not be ruled out. Besides, Avtar Singh (PW-8) is a chance witness and it is\n\nproverbially unsafe and rash to rely on the testimony of a chance witness.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">            The case is based on circumstantial evidence. The Court is to guard\n\nitself against the danger of allowing conjecture or suspicion to take place of proof.\n\nHowever, if all the facts established by the prosecution are consistent only with the\n\nhypothesis of guilt of the accused and totally inconsistent with their innocence such\n\nevidence can be accepted. The circumstances from which the guilt of the accused is\n\nto be proved, however, are to be proved and established beyond shadow of reasonable\n\ndoubt.   Besides, the circumstances taken cumulatively should form a chain so\n\ncomplete that there is no escape from the conclusion that within all human\n\nprobability the crime was committed by the accused and none else. For the conviction\n\nto be based on circumstantial evidence, the circumstances are to be complete and\n\nincapable of explanation of any other hypothesis than that of guilt of the accused.\n\nBesides, such evidence is to be consistent not only with the guilt of the accused but\n\nalso inconsistent with his innocence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">            Harpal Singh (PW-1) in his deposition has denied that Mukhtiar Singh\n\n(deceased) was working as a cleaner on his truck. According to Shingara Singh\n\n(PW-2) he was told that one Avtar Singh (appellant) was arrested by the police and\n\ngiven a beating by the police. Avtar Singh (appellant) confessed before the police\n\nthat he alongwith Karnail Singh (appellant) had concealed the dead body of Mukhtiar\n\nSingh (deceased).    Karnail Singh (appellant) on interrogation in the presence of\n\nShingara Singh (PW2) and ASI Joga Singh (PW18) made a disclosure statement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                       -19-</span>\n\n\n\n(Ex.PW-5/A) on 23.3.2001 that he had concealed truck No. PUR 3743, which was in\n\nan empty condition and was parked at an open space of an unconstructed shop in the\n\ngrain market at Mandi Gobindgarh. On the basis of the said disclosure statement\n\n(Ex.PW-5/A), the truck was recovered vide memo (Ex.PW-5/B) on 23.3.2001 itself.\n\nHe further disclosed on 25.3.2001 vide disclosure statement (Ex.PB) that the iron\n\nmaterial contained in the truck had been concealed on the side of Sirhind near the to\n\nG.T. Road close to the bridge on the canal minor in the bushes in a four walled\n\nenclosure and he could get the same recovered. In pursuance of memo (Ex.PB/1) the\n\niron material was recovered on 25.3.2001. However, according to Harpal Singh\n\n(PW-1), the remaining iron goods were recovered from the place from where the\n\ntruck was recovered by the police. This is in contradiction to the statement of\n\nShingara Singh (PW-2) who stated that the iron goods contained in the truck were\n\nrecovered from near the canal minor close to G.T. Road in a four walled enclosure.\n\nTherefore, there is an inconsistency as regards the recovery of the goods inasmuch as\n\naccording to Shingara Singh (PW2), the iron goods contained in the truck were\n\nrecovered from near the canal minor close to G.T. Road in a four walled enclosure\n\nwhereas according to Harpal Singh (PW1) the remaining iron goods were recovered\n\nfrom the place from where the truck was recovered by the police. In fact the truck\n\nwas recovered in an empty condition, which would mean it was not loaded. Besides,\n\nthere are two disclosure statements of Karnail Singh appellant. One was made on\n\n23.3.2001 (Ex.PW-5/A) regarding the truck being concealed in an empty condition at\n\nan open place of an unconstructed shop in the grain market at Mandi Gobindgarh. In\n\npursuance of the said disclosure statement the truck No.PUR 3743 was recovered\n\nvide memo Ex.PW 5/B. The other disclosure statement (Ex.PB) was made by Karnail\n\nSingh (appellant) on 25.3.2001 in pursuance of which the iron material was\n\nrecovered vide memo (Ex.PB/1). This shows that the investigation was being\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                         -20-</span>\n\n\n\nconducted in a piece meal manner. There was no occasion in the facts and\n\ncircumstances of the present case for Karnail Singh (appellant) to have made two\n\ndisclosure statements on 23.3.2001 (Ex.PW-5/A) and again on 25.03.2001(Ex.PB).\n\nKarnail Singh could have made both the statements on 23.3.2001 itself. It appears\n\nthat it was to cover up the recovery of the iron material that the second disclosure\n\nstatement (Ex.PB) was recorded on 25.3.2001.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">            Parminder Singh (PW-16) had produced the appellant Avtar` Singh\n\nbefore the police. The appellant Avtar Singh is said to have made an extra judicial\n\nconfession before him. It is stated by Parminder Singh (PW16) that Avtar Singh\n\n(appellant) about 2-2½ years back had come to him and said that the police was\n\nraiding his house and as he had good relations with the SHO, he should produce him\n\nbefore the police. However, it is stated that Avtar Singh (appellant) did not confess\n\nbefore him regarding the murder of Mukhtiar Singh and also about taking truck No.\n\nPUR 3743 forcibly by him. He was declared hostile and in cross-examination it is\n\nstated that his statement was recorded by the Police but it was not read over to him.\n\nIt was neither a fact nor had he stated to the police that Avtar Singh (appellant) made\n\nan extra judicial confession before him that he alongwith Karnail Singh (appellant) in\n\nbetween the night of 16/17.03.2001 took Mukhtiar Singh (deceased) in truck No.\n\nPUR 3743 after he consumed liquor which was offered by them and they killed\n\nMukhtiar Singh by throttling and took the dead body of Mukhtiar Singh in truck No.\n\nPUR 3743 along with the material lying in truck and the truck was driven by Karnail\n\nSingh. Attention of the witness was drawn to his statement Ex. PW16/A portion A to\n\nA-1 where it was so recorded. Parminder Singh (PW16) denied that he had made any\n\nsuch statement.   It was stated that it was neither a fact nor had he stated before the\n\npolice that Karnail Singh (appellant) was driving the truck and .Avtar Singh\n\n(appellant) was sitting with him and had thrown the dead body of Mukhtiar Singh\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                          -21-</span>\n\n\n\nafter crossing village Libra near the Lime Kiln and took the truck along with its\n\nmaterial and left the truck at a &#x27;dhabha&#x27;. Attention of the witness was drawn to his\n\nstatement Ex.PW16/A portion B to B-1 where these facts were recorded.                It is\n\naccepted as correct that he produced Avtar Singh (appellant) before the Police.\n\nParminder Singh (PW16) states as incorrect that he had been won over by the\n\naccused and he was deposing falsely. Parminder Singh (PW-16), therefore, did not\n\nsupport the prosecution case in Court. He was declared hostile but nothing could be\n\ngot out which may help the prosecution. As such his testimony is not of much help to\n\nthe prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">             The prosecution case also is that Mukhtiar Singh was administered\n\npoison. Dr. Harish Tulli (PW4) conducted the post mortem examination on the dead\n\nbody of Mukhtiar Singh on 20.3.2001. On examination of the dead body Dr. Harish\n\nTulli (PW4) observed that the body was badly decomposed and foul smelling. There\n\nwere multiple abrasions on front and middle on the neck.               Small petechia\n\nhaemorrhages were present underneath the abrasions. Mild synosis was present in\n\neyes, lips, tongue and nails. The body organs were congested and routine visceras\n\nwere sent to the Chemical Examiner for Chemical Analysis.      The cause of death was\n\nto be given after receiving the Chemical Examiner&#x27;s report. The time between death\n\nand post mortem was mentioned as 3½ days. According to the Chemical Examiner&#x27;s\n\nreport (Ex.PW4/B), no poison was found in the contents of the exhibits i.e. a sealed\n\njar said to contain stomach and part of small intestine with contents; a sealed jar said\n\nto contain part of liver, spleen and half of each kidney; a sealed jar said to contain\n\nsample of blood and a sealed jar said to contain sample of preservative. After the\n\nreceipt of Chemical Examiner&#x27;s report (Ex.PW4/B), Dr. Harish Tulli (PW-4) gave his\n\nopinion Ex.PW4/B1 that death in this case was due to asphyxia due to throttling. In\n\ncross-examination, it is stated by Dr. Harish Tulli (PW-4) that alcohol was not found\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\"> Criminal Appeal No. D-406-DB of 2004                                        -22-</span>\n\n\n\nin viscera sent for Chemical Examination. The duration between injury and death\n\ncould be 8 minutes. It may be noticed that no alcohol was found present as per the\n\nChemical Examiner&#x27;s report (Ex.PW4/B) from the dead body of Mukhtiar Singh\n\nwhereas the prosecution case was that liquor had been administered to Mukhtiar\n\nSingh (deceased) before taking his truck and before nipping his neck.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">            In the circumstances, it may be noticed that :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      (1)   Avtar Singh (PW-8) states that he saw Karnail Singh and Avtar Singh\n\n(appellants) at a &#x27;dhaba&#x27; on 16.03.2001 at about 11.00 pm.
