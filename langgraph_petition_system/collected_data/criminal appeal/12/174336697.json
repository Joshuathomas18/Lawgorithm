As a result of orders passed by this Court from time to time, the\n\n      Central Bureau of Investigation (for short ‘the CBI’) filed a charge sheet\n\n      against the appellant Girish Kumar Suneja and others. On 29 th April, 2016\n\n      the learned Special Judge appointed to hear the criminal cases arising out of\n\n      the illegal allocation of coal blocks, directed framing of charges in the case\n\n      titled CBI v.

Being aggrieved by the order passed by the learned Special Judge,\n\n      Criminal Misc. Case No. 3847 of 2016 was filed in the Delhi High Court by\n\n      Girish Kumar Suneja. In the High Court, a preliminary issue arose regarding\n\n      the maintainability of the petition in view of paragraph 10 of the order\n\n      passed by this Court on 25th July, 2014.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">      7.    A learned Single Judge of the High Court heard elaborate submissions\n\n      of learned counsel and by a well reasoned order, after relying upon several\n\n      decisions of this Court and of the Delhi High Court, concluded that in view\n\n      of the order passed by this Court on 25th July, 2014 the petition deserves to\n\n      be dismissed as not maintainable. Against that decision of the High Court,\n\n      the present appeal has been preferred by Suneja.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">      8.    Appeals raising a similar issue have been preferred by other accused\n\n      persons arising out of the same order and also by others in other proceedings\n\n      before the learned Special Judge. The learned Special Public Prosecutor Mr.\n\n      R.S. Cheema placed before us a tabular statement of all appeals raising the\n\n      same substantive issue as has been raised by Suneja. With consent, we took\n\n      up all these appeals and heard learned counsel for the appellants as also the\n\n      learned Special Public Prosecutor and learned counsel for the CBI.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">      9.    Learned counsel for the appellants raised several contentions, all of\n\n      them directed towards the conclusion that paragraph 10 of the order passed\n\n        Crl.

The submission made on behalf of the appellants was that they have a\n\n      right to file a revision petition against orders passed by the learned Special\n\n      Judge but the order passed by this Court effectively prevents the High Court\n\n      from entertaining any such petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1322317\" id=\"span_12\">12.     The Constitution Bench of this Court considered the scope of the\n\n      revision jurisdiction of the High Court under Section 439 of the Criminal\n\n        Crl. Appeal Nos.______/2017 etc. (@ SLP (Crl.) Nos. 9503/2016 etc.)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">Page 6 of 53</span>\n\f      Procedure Code, 1898 (the old Code) in <a href=\"/doc/1322317/\" id=\"a_19\">Pranab Kumar Mitra v. State of\n\n      West Bengal.3 The</a> consideration was in the context of an application for\n\n      substitution filed by the son of a convict who had challenged his conviction\n\n      and sentence, but had expired during the pendency of the revision petition.\n\n      The Constitution Bench held that the revision jurisdiction of the High Court\n\n      is a discretionary jurisdiction to be exercised in aid of justice. What is\n\n      significant is that a litigant does not have a right to have a revisable order set\n\n      aside. Whether the High Court chooses to exercise its revision jurisdiction in\n\n      a particular case or not depends upon the facts of that case - hence, the\n\n      reference to the revision jurisdiction as a discretionary jurisdiction. The\n\n      revision jurisdiction of the High Court only conserves the power of the High\n\n      Court to ensure that justice is done in accordance with the recognized rules\n\n      of criminal jurisprudence and that criminal courts subordinate to the High\n\n      Court do not exceed their jurisdiction or abuse the powers vested in them by\n\n      the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_20\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> (the old Code). In view of these conclusions of\n\n      the Constitution Bench, there is no doubt that the appellants do not have any\n\n      right to the revision of a revisable order. It was held as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                   “In our opinion, in the absence of statutory provisions, in terms\n                   applying to an application in revision, as there are those in Section\n                   431 in respect of criminal appeals, the High Court has the power to\n                   pass such orders as to it may seem fit and proper, in exercise of its\n                   revisional jurisdiction vested in it by Section 439 of the Code.\n      3      1959 Supp. (1) SCR 63\n        Crl.

Whether or not the High Court will exercise its revisional\n                   jurisdiction in a given case, must depend upon the facts and\n                   circumstances of that case.

Similarly, an order for\n\n      framing of charges if reversed has the effect of discharging the accused\n\n      person and resulting in a final order in his or her favour. Therefore, an\n\n      intermediate order is one which if passed in a certain way, the proceedings\n\n      would terminate but if passed in another way, the proceedings would\n\n      continue.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"371567\" id=\"span_25\">22.

A\n                   harmonious construction of Sections 397 and 482 would lead to the\n                   irresistible conclusion that where a particular order is expressly\n                   barred under Section 397(2) and cannot be the subject of revision by\n                   the High Court, then to such a case the provisions of Section 482\n                   would not apply.

Moreover and quite obviously, since this Court had directed in\n\n      Antulay that the trial would have to be conducted not by the Special Judge\n\n      but by the High Court, no revision would lie to the High Court from its own\n\n      order. Therefore, we are of opinion that the appellants cannot draw any\n\n      support for their submissions from Antulay.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">      27.   Our conclusion on this subject is that while the appellants might have\n\n      an entitlement (not a right) to file a revision petition in the High Court but\n\n      that entitlement can be taken away and in any event, the High Court is under\n\n      no obligation to entertain a revision petition – such a petition can be rejected\n\n      at the threshold. If the High Court is inclined to accept the revision petition\n\n      it can do so only against a final order or an intermediate order, namely, an\n\n      order which if set aside would result in the culmination of the proceedings.\n\n      As we see it, there appear to be only two such eventualities of a revisable\n\n      order and in any case only one such eventuality is before us. Consequently\n\n      the result of paragraph 10 of the order passed by this Court is that the\n\n      entitlement of the appellants to file a revision petition in the High Court is\n\n      taken away and thereby the High Court is deprived of exercising its\n\n      extraordinary discretionary power available under <a href=\"/doc/1457888/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 397</a> of the Cr.P.C.\n\n\n\n        Crl. Appeal Nos.______/2017 etc. (@ SLP (Crl.) Nos. 9503/2016 etc.)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">Page 16 of 53</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">\f      28.   However, this does not mean that the appellants have no remedy\n\n      available to them - paragraph 10 of the order does not prohibit the appellants\n\n      from approaching this Court under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution. Therefore\n\n      all that has happened is that the forum for ventilating the grievance of the\n\n      appellants has shifted from the High Court to this Court. It was submitted by\n\n      one of the learned counsel that this is not good enough for the appellants\n\n      since this Court is not obliged to give reasons while dismissing such a\n\n      petition unlike the High Court which would necessarily have to give reasons\n\n      if it rejected a revision petition. In our opinion, the mere fact that this Court\n\n      could dismiss the petition filed by the appellants under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 136</a> of the\n\n      Constitution without giving reasons does not necessarily lead to the\n\n      conclusion that reasons will not be given or that some equitable order will\n\n      not be passed. The submission of learned counsel has no basis and is only a\n\n      presumption of what this Court might do. We cannot accept a submission\n\n      that has its foundation on a hypothesis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">      29.   This leads us to another facet of the submission made by learned\n\n      counsel that even the avenue of proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C.\n\n      is barred as far as the appellants are concerned. As held in Amar Nath and\n\n      with which conclusion we agree, if an interlocutory order is not revisable\n\n      due to the prohibition contained in <a href=\"/doc/1846048/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 397(2)</a> of the Cr.P.C. that cannot\n\n        Crl.

What then is the utility of <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C.? This was\n\n      considered and explained in Madhu Limaye which noticed the prohibition in\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1846048/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 397(2)</a> of the Cr.P.C. and at the same time the expansive text of\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 482</a> of the Cr.P.C. and posed the question: In such a situation, what\n\n      is the harmonious way out? This Court then proceeded to answer the\n\n      question in the following manner:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">                   “In such a situation, what is the harmonious way out? In our opinion,\n                   a happy solution of this problem would be to say that the bar\n                   provided in sub-section (2) of Section 397 operates only in exercise\n                   of the revisional power of the High Court, meaning thereby that the\n                   High Court will have no power of revision in relation to any\n                   interlocutory order. Then in accordance with one of the other\n                   principles enunciated above, the inherent power will come into play,\n                   there being no other provision in the Code for the redress of the\n                   grievance of the aggrieved party. But then, if the order assailed is\n                   purely of an interlocutory character which could be corrected in\n                   exercise of the revisional power of the High Court under the 1898\n                   Code, the High Court will refuse to exercise its inherent power. But\n                   in case the impugned order clearly brings about a situation which is\n                   an abuse of the process of the Court or for the purpose of securing\n                   the ends of justice interference by the High Court is absolutely\n                   necessary, then nothing contained in Section 397(2) can limit or\n                   affect the exercise of the inherent power by the High Court. But such\n                   cases would be few and far between. The High Court must exercise\n                   the inherent power very sparingly.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1033637\" id=\"span_35\">31.

In our opinion, it is not as if one single case has been taken up for\n\n      allegedly discriminatory treatment out of an entire gamut of cases. All the\n\n      cases relating to the allocation of coal blocks have been compartmentalized\n\n      and are required to be treated and dealt with in the same manner. The coal\n\n      block allocation cases form one identifiable category of cases that are\n\n      distinct from other cases since they have had a massive impact on public\n\n      interest and there have been large scale illegalities associated with the\n\n      allocation of coal blocks.     It is therefore necessary to treat these cases\n\n      differentially since they form a unique identifiable category. The treatment\n\n      of these cases is certainly not arbitrary – on the contrary, the classification is\n\n      in public interest and for the public good with a view to bring persons who\n\n      have allegedly committed corrupt activities, within the rule of law. It is\n\n      hence not possible to accept the submission that by treating the entire batch\n\n      of coal block allocation cases in a particular manner different from the usual\n\n      cases that flood the Courts, there is a violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 14</a> of the\n\n      Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">\n\n\n      19     1952 SCR 284\n        Crl.

Very often, public interest is lost sight of while\n\n      dealing with an accused person and the rights of an accused person are given\n\n      far greater importance than societal interests and more often than not greater\n\n      importance than the rights of individual victims. This is a delicate balance\n      23     (1998) 4 SCC 409\n        Crl. Appeal Nos.______/2017 etc. (@ SLP (Crl.)

However, it was then submitted that in passing the order of 25 th July,\n\n      2014 this Court has prevented the grant of any interim stay by any court and\n\n      has even otherwise gone beyond its remit as stated in <a href=\"/doc/1203995/\" id=\"a_143\">Vineet Narain v.\n\n      Union of India27</a> wherein it was specifically held that the task of monitoring\n\n      investigations by a court is over the moment a charge sheet is filed in respect\n\n      25      AIR 1969 SC 430\n      26      (2012) 13 SCC 614\n      27      (1998) 1 SCC 226\n        Crl.

It was submitted that paragraph 10 of the order\n\n      permits the continuation of the monitoring process at the stage of trial as\n\n      well and therefore goes beyond the stage of investigation. In other words, it\n\n      was submitted that the terms of the order passed by this Court result in\n\n      monitoring and supervising the trials by this Court, which is impermissible.</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">      57.   There is obviously some misconception in this regard as far as the\n\n      appellants are concerned. This Court is not in any manner monitoring the\n\n      progress of the trial in the coal block allocation cases nor is it supervising\n\n      the trial. Conducting the trial is entirely the business of the learned Special\n\n      Judge. Paragraph 10 of the order only results in the removal of any\n\n      impediment in the progress of the trial. To ensure that the trial is concluded\n\n      at the earliest not only in the interest of the accused persons but also in\n\n      public interest, any application intended to stay or impede the trial will be\n\n      subject to orders of this Court. This out of the ordinary step has been taken\n\n      given the serious nature of allegations made against those believed to be\n\n      involved in the illegal allocation of coal blocks and in the interest of the\n\n      accused as well as in larger public interest. As mentioned above, there is a\n\n      need for maintaining a balance between the rights of an accused and the\n\n      rights of an individual victim and society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">        Crl.

In Vineet Narain it was further observed by this Court that a proper\n\n      investigation must be followed by an equally effective prosecution so as not\n\n      to make the exercise completely futile. This is an important aspect of the\n\n      rule of law, the emphasis being on a strong and competent prosecution\n\n      machinery and not merely a fair and competent investigation followed by an\n\n      equally fair trial. This is in the nature of an entire package and to obtain\n\n      appropriate results (one way or the other) is to ensure there is no\n\n      unnecessary impediment in a trial, in the form of a stay of proceedings or in\n\n      any other manner. The emphasis given by learned counsel on the right of the\n\n      appellants to apply for a stay of proceedings gives the impression that the\n\n      appellants are primarily concerned with an interim order of stay and not in\n\n      the conclusion of the trial. It should be clear that a stay of proceedings is not\n\n      the most important part of a trial and should not be the main or the sole\n\n      objective of an accused. We need to think beyond a stay of criminal\n\n      proceedings which has played havoc with our criminal justice delivery.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_88\">      59.   The submission that paragraph 10 of the order passed by this Court\n\n      fetters the discretion of the High Court in granting a stay of proceedings\n\n      proceeds on the assumption that the High Court has an unfettered discretion\n\n      to stay a trial. This is simply not so – the stay of a trial is a rather\n\n      extraordinary step and cannot be given for the asking.\n\n        Crl. Appeal Nos.______/2017 etc. (@ SLP (Crl.)

In this context, we may note that we are not concerned with any\n\n      ordinary criminal trial, but a trial for an offence punishable under the\n\n      provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_144\">Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988</a>. We may draw\n\n      attention to the Statement and Objects and Reasons for introducing the\n\n      Prevention of Corruption Bill in Parliament, with which we are concerned. It\n\n      is stated, inter alia, that “In order to expedite the proceedings, provisions for\n\n      day-to-day trial of cases and prohibitory provisions with regard to grant of\n\n      stay and exercise of powers of revision on interlocutory orders have also\n\n      been included.” Both these objectives have been incorporated in the\n\n      provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_145\">Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988</a> through <a href=\"/doc/97670/\" id=\"a_146\">Section 19</a> and\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/731949/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 4</a> thereof.

A reading of <a href=\"/doc/181/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 19(3)</a> of the PC Act indicates that it deals with\n\n      three situations: (i) Sub-clause (a) deals a situation where a final judgment\n\n      and sentence has been delivered by the Special Judge. We are not concerned\n\n      with this situation. (ii) Sub-clause (b) deals with a stay of proceedings under\n\n      the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_163\">PC Act</a> in the event of any error, omission or irregularity in the grant of\n\n      sanction by the concerned authority to prosecute the accused person.

Sub-section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/97670/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 19</a> of the PC Act is also important in this\n\n      context inasmuch as the time lapse in challenging an error, omission or\n\n      irregularity in the sanction resulting in a failure of justice is of considerable\n\n      significance. Unless the challenge is made at the initial stages of a trial and\n\n      within a reasonable period of time, the court would not be obliged to\n\n      consider the absence of, or any error, omission or irregularity in the sanction\n\n      for prosecution.    Therefore, it is not as if the accused can, after an\n\n      unreasonable delay, raise an issue about the sanction; but if that accused\n\n      does so, the court may not decide that issue both at the appellate stage as\n\n      well as for the purposes of stay of the proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">      67.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1385093\" id=\"span_78\">In <a href=\"/doc/1385093/\" id=\"a_170\">Central Bureau of Investigation v.

It\n\n      was explained that a trial involves judicial scrutiny of the entire material\n\n      before the Special Judge. Therefore, if on a judicial scrutiny of the evidence\n\n      on record the Special Judge comes to a conclusion that there was sufficient\n\n      reason to convict the accused person, the absence or error or omission or\n\n      irregularity would actually become a surplusage. The necessity of a sanction\n\n      is only as a filter to safeguard public servants from frivolous or mala fide or\n\n      vindictive prosecution. However, after judicial scrutiny is complete and a\n\n      conviction is made out through the filtration process, the issue of a sanction\n\n      really would become inconsequential. It was held in paragraphs 10 and 11 of\n\n      the Report as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">                   “A court of appeal or revision is debarred from reversing a finding\n                   (or even an order of conviction and sentence) on account of any\n                   error or irregularity in the sanction for the prosecution, unless failure\n                   of justice had been occasioned on account of such error or\n                   irregularity.

It has to be determined on\n                   the facts of each case. But an accused who did not raise it at the trial\n                   stage cannot possibly sustain such a plea made for the first time in\n                   the appellate court…...\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">                   In a case where the accused failed to raise the question of valid\n                   sanction the trial would normally proceed to its logical end by\n                   making a judicial scrutiny of the entire materials. If that case ends in\n                   conviction there is no question of failure of justice on the mere\n                   premise that no valid sanction was accorded for prosecuting the\n                   public servant because the very purpose of providing such a filtering\n                   check is to safeguard public servants from frivolous or mala fide or\n                   vindictive prosecution on the allegation that they have committed\n                   offence in the discharge of their official duties. But once the judicial\n                   filtering process is over on completion of the trial the purpose of\n                   providing for the initial sanction would bog down to a surplusage.\n                   This could be the reason for providing a bridle upon the appellate\n                   and revisional forums as envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/338903/\" id=\"a_171\">Section 465</a> of the Code of\n                   Criminal Procedure.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">      68.

While dealing with the submissions made in relation to the aforesaid\n\n      order (submissions that are similar to those made before us) this Court held\n\n      that considering the width and ambit of the investigation which could even\n\n      spread overseas and also considering the larger public interest, the aforesaid\n\n      order was passed reserving the right of the accused to move this Court if\n\n      there is a grievance against the order passed by the Special Judge during the\n\n      trial and that this would ensure that progress in the trial is not hampered.\n\n      Such an order was permissible under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_193\">Article 136</a> read with\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_194\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution.

This Court held in paragraphs 22 and 23 of the Report as\n\n      follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">                   “We may, at the very outset, point out that CBI as well as the\n                   Enforcement Directorate are yet to complete the investigation of the\n                   cases relating to 2G Scam and the case which is being tried by the\n                   Special Judge is only one amongst them, wherein the charge-sheet\n                   has been filed and the trial is in progress. This Court, taking into\n                   consideration the width and ambit of the investigation which even\n                   spreads overseas and the larger public interest involved, passed the\n                   orders impugned, reserving the right of all, including the accused\n                   persons, to move this Court if their prayer would amount to staying\n                   or impeding the progress of the trial. In case they have any grievance\n                   against the orders passed by the Special Judge during trial, they are\n                   free to approach this Court so that the progress of the trial would not\n                   be hampered by indulging in cumbersome and time-consuming\n                   proceedings in the other forums, thereby stultifying the peremptory\n                   direction given by this Court for day-to-day trial.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">                   <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_197\">Article 136</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_198\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India enables\n                   this Court to pass such orders, which are necessary for doing\n                   complete justice in any cause or matter pending before it and, any\n                   order so made, shall be enforceable throughout the territory of India.\n                   The parties, in such a case, cannot invoke the jurisdiction under\n                   <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_199\">Article 226</a> or 227 of the Constitution of India or under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_200\">Section 482</a>\n                   CrPC so as to interfere with those orders passed by this Court, in\n                   exercise of its constitutional powers conferred under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_201\">Article 136</a> read\n                   with <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_202\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution of India.

Appeal Nos.______/2017 etc. (@ SLP (Crl.) Nos. 9503/2016 etc.)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">Page 51 of 53</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">\f      81.   It was further held that the order passed only facilitates the progress of\n\n      the trial by ordering that it must proceed on a day to day basis. It was noted\n\n      that the backlog of cases is often an incentive to the litigants to take unfair\n\n      advantage of the delays and therefore, it was necessary to pass the order\n\n      dated 11th April, 2011. It was stated as follows in paragraph 31 of the\n\n      Report:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">                   “We also, therefore, find no basis in the contention of the petitioners\n                   that the orders dated 11-4-2011 and 9-11-2012 have the effect of\n                   monitoring the trial proceedings. No court, other than the court\n                   seized of the trial, has the power to monitor the proceedings pending\n                   before it. The order dated 11-4-2011 only facilitates the progress of\n                   the trial by ordering that the trial must proceed on a day-to-day basis.\n                   Large backlog of cases in the courts is often an incentive to the\n                   litigants to misuse the courts’ system by indulging in unnecessary\n                   and fraudulent litigation, thereby delaying the entire trial process.\n                   Criminal justice system’s procedure guarantees and elaborateness\n                   sometimes give, create openings for abusive, dilatory tactics and\n                   confer unfair advantage on better heeled litigants to cause delay to\n                   their advantage. Longer the trial, witnesses will be unavailable,\n                   memories will fade and evidence will be stale. Taking into\n                   consideration all those aspects, this Court felt that it is in the larger\n                   public interest that the trial of 2G Scam be not hampered. Further,\n                   when larger public interest is involved, it is the bounden duty of all,\n                   including the accused persons, who are presumed to be innocent,\n                   until proven guilty, to cooperate with the progress of the trial. Early\n                   disposal of the trial is also to their advantage, so that their innocence\n                   could be proved, rather than remain enmeshed in criminal trial for\n                   years and unable to get on with their lives and business.”\n\n      Conclusion\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">      82.
