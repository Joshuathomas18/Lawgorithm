The   initial   investigation   with   regard   to \n\n\n\nthe incident  was carried out by Inspector  Niranjan  Singh  but \n\n\n\npursuant   to   the   orders   of   the   Government   of   India   made   on \n\n\n\nthe 1st  April of 1997 the investigation was handed over to the \n\n\n\nCentral   Bureau   of   Investigation   (hereinafter   called   the   CBI) \n\n\n\nand   the   two   FIRs   were   amalgamated   for   the   purpose   of \n\n\n\ninvestigation.     The   CBI,   on   investigation,   came   to   the \n\n\n\nconclusion that the police party headed by ACP Satyavir Singh \n\n\n\nRathi   and   Inspector   Anil   Kumar   had   fired   on   the   Maruti \n\n\n\nEsteem   car   without   provocation   and   that   FIR   No.   448/97 \n\n\n\ndated   31st  March   1997,   registered   on   the   complaint   of \n\n\n\nInspector   Anil   Kumar,   was   intended   to   act   as   a   cover-up   for \n\n\n\nthe   incident   and   to   justify   the   police   action.     The   CBI \n\n\n\naccordingly found that no shot had been fired from inside the \n\n\n\ncar by Jagjit Singh, as alleged, and that the claim in this FIR \n\n\f\n                       Crl.

As a result of the investigation made in both the \n\n\n\nFIRs,   a   charge   sheet   was   filed   before   the   Chief   Metropolitan \n\n\n\nMagistrate   on   the   13th  June   1997.

It   has \n\n\n\nbeen  pointed  out   that  the   investigation  had   revealed that  the \n\n\n\nincident   had   happened   as   the   police   party   was   under   the \n\n\n\nimpression that Jagjit Singh was in fact Mohd.

These   relate   to   the   place   and   time   of   incident,     the \n\n\n\npresence   of   the   appellants   duly   armed   with   most   of   them \n\n\n\nhaving   fired   into   the   car   with   their   service   weapons,   that \n\n\n\nMohd.   Yaseen   was   admittedly   a   notorious   criminal   and   that \n\n\n\nJagjit   Singh   (deceased)   had   been   mistaken   by   Inspector   Anil \n\n\n\nKumar   for   Mohd.   Yaseen,   and   that   Pradeep   Goyal   owned   a \n\n\n\nblue Esteem Car with a Uttar Pradesh number plate, and had \n\n\n\nhis office in Patparganj near the Mother Dairy Booth.   It is in \n\n\n\nthis background that the prosecution and the defence versions \n\n\n\nhave   to   be   examined.         The   prosecution   story   has   already \n\n\n\nbeen   narrated   above   and   does   not   require   any   recapitulation \n\n\n\nin detail.    Suffice it to say that Inspector Anil Kumar and his \n\n\n\ntwo associates had followed the car driven by Pradeep Goyal to \n\n\n\nthe   Dena   Bank   Branch   at   Connaught   Place   and   it   was   after \n\n\n\nPradeep   Goyal   and   the   others   had   left   the   Dena   Bank \n\n\n\npremises   and   were   near   the   Barakhamba   Road   crossing   that \n\n\n\nthe   two   police   parties,   one   headed   by   Inspector   Anil   Kumar, \n\n\f\n                         Crl.

It   is   at   this   stage   that   the   prosecution   and   the \n\n\n\ndefence   deviate   as  it   is   the   case   of   the   defence   that   after   the \n\n\n\ncar had been surrounded, Inspector Anil Kumar had knocked \n\n\n\nat  the   driver&#x27;s  window  asking   the  occupants  to  come  out  but \n\n\n\ninstead   of   doing   so   Jagjit   Singh   had   fired   two   shots   at   the \n\n\n\npolice   which   had   led  to   a   fusillade   in  self   defence.     It   is   true \n\n\n\nthat   Avtar   Singh   PW,   who   was   an   injured   witness   and   ASI \n\n\n\nOmbir Singh, PW-13 did say that the multiple firing had been \n\n\n\npreceded   by   one   solitary   shot   which   apparently   is   in \n\n\n\nconsonance   with   the   defence   version.     Likewise,   PW-13   ASI \n\n\n\nOmbir   Singh,   PW15   Inspector   Ram   Mehar,   PW-35   Inspector \n\n\n\nRishi Dev, PW41 Constable Samrat Lal, and PW-57 S.I.

We have perused the photograph \n\n\n\nourselves   and   find   that   the   driver&#x27;s   window   was   definitely \n\n\n\nintact.     The   photograph   is   in   black   and   white   and   has   been \n\n\n\ntaken through the driver&#x27;s window and the man wearing white \n\n\n\nwith   a   dark   tie   seen   in   the   photograph   has   two   shades   of \n\n\n\nwhite, the portion through the window having a dull hue and \n\n\n\nthe portion above, far brighter.  It has come in the evidence of \n\n\n\nPW-Tarunpreet that the car A.C. was on when the firing took \n\n\n\nplace and the windows had been drawn up.  We can also take \n\n\n\nnotice   that   in   this   background,   the   windows   and   windshield \n\n\n\nwould be of tinted glass.   Likewise, we are also of the opinion \n\n\n\nthat  had  the   shots   been  fired  through   the   driver&#x27;s  window   or \n\n\n\nthe   windshield   some   powder   residues   would   have   been   left \n\n\n\naround   the   bullet   holes   as   the   shots   would   have   been   fired \n\n\n\nfrom almost a touching distance.

He  also   stated   that in  all  at   least  29   bullet   holes   had \n\n\n\nbeen detected on the car of 9 mm, 7.62 mm and .380 calibre \n\n\n\nweapons and that most of the seven exit holes in the car could \n\n\n\nhave   been  caused  by   bullets   fired  from   the   rear   and  left  side \n\n\n\ninto the car and exiting thereafter, although the possibility of \n\n\n\nan exit hole being caused by a bullet fired from inside the car \n\n\n\ncould also not be ruled out.  He further pointed out that as the \n\n\n\nbullet fired at Constable Subhash Chand remained embedded \n\n\n\nin his body and had not been taken out for medical reasons, it \n\n\n\nwas not possible to give an opinion whether it was a bullet of \n\n\n\n7.65   mm   calibre.       The   defence   story   that   Constables   Sunil \n\n\n\nand Subhash had suffered injuries on account of the firing of \n\n\n\ntwo shots from inside the car, is further belied by the medical \n\n\n\nevidence.     PW-16-Dr. Harmeet Kapur carried out the medico \n\n\n\nlegal   examination   of   Constable   Subhash   Chand   Ex.PW16/B. \n\n\n\nHe found three bullet injuries on his person, which indicated \n\n\n\nblackening.     These   injuries   could   not   have   been   caused   by \n\n\n\nfiring from inside the car as the blackening from a pistol would \n\n\f\n                        Crl.

Likewise,   PW-17   Dr.   Neeraj   Saxena   who \n\n\n\nhad   examined   Constable   Subhash   Chand,   also   found   three \n\n\n\nseparate gun shot injuries on his person.  He also produced in \n\n\n\nevidence   his   treatment   record   Ex.PW17/B.     This   doctor   was \n\n\n\nnot   even   cross-examined   by   the   prosecution.     It   needs   to   be \n\n\n\nemphasized   that   all   the   weapons   used   in   the   incident   fired \n\n\n\nsingle   projectiles   (i.e.   bullets),   whereas   the   distance   between \n\n\n\nthe   gun   shot   injuries   on   the   two   injured   policemen   show   at \n\n\n\nleast   3   different   wounds   of   entry   on   each   of   them.     On   the \n\n\n\ncontrary,   it   appears   that   the   injuries   suffered   by   them   were \n\n\n\ncaused   by   the   firing   amongst   the   policemen   as   they   had \n\n\n\nsurrounded and fired into the car indiscriminately and without \n\n\n\ncaution ignoring that they could be a danger to themselves on \n\n\n\ncross-fire on uncontrolled firing.   It has, in fact, been pointed \n\n\n\nout by Mr. Sharan that ACP Rathi had written to his superiors \n\n\n\npointing   to   the   ineptitude   of   his   team   of   officers   but   he   had \n\n\n\nbeen told that no other staff was available.   The present case \n\n\n\nillustrates and proves the adage that a weapon in the hands of \n\n\n\nan   ill   trained   individual   is   often   more   of   a   danger   to   himself \n\n\f\n                         Crl.

In this background, the evidence of PW&#x27;s Geeta Ram \n\n\n\nSharma,   Sayeed   Ahmad   and   Shah   Nawaz,   PW-50   Constable \n\n\n\nK.K.Rajan   and   PW-51   Constable   Rajinderan   Pilley   becomes \n\n\n\nextremely   relevant.     PW-13   ASI   Ombir   Singh   who   was   the \n\n\n\nOfficer   In-Charge   of   the   PCR   Gypsy   parked   near   the   Fire \n\n\n\nStation   Building   adjoining   Barakhamba   Road,   had \n\n\n\nundoubtedly supported the defence version that a single shot \n\n\n\nhad been followed by a volley.  Constable Rajan and Constable \n\n\n\nPilley,   who   were   present   along   with   ASI   Ombir   Singh, \n\n\n\ncategorically stated that they had not heard any single fire and \n\n\n\nit   was   only   the   continuous   firing   that   had   brought   them \n\n\n\nrushing to the site and having reached there, they had taken \n\n\n\nthe   three   victims   to   the   R.M.L.   Hospital.     Their   story   is \n\n\n\ncorroborated   by   the   evidence   of   the   three   newspaper \n\n\n\nemployees.     Tarunpreet   Singh   PW   was   also   categoric   that   no \n\n\n\nshot   had   been   fired   from   inside   the   car.     The   story   therefore \n\n\n\nthat  Jagjit   Singh   had  fired   at  the   police   party   when   accosted \n\n\n\nis,   therefore,   on   the   face   of   it,   unacceptable.

First   and \n\n\n\nforemost,   it   appears   that   even   prior   to   the   arrival   of   PW-42 \n\n\n\nSHO Niranjan Singh, the Car had already been searched and \n\n\n\nthe site violated as a cell phone belonging to one of the victims \n\n\n\nhad been picked up by appellant ASI Ashok Rana and handed \n\n\n\nover to the SHO.  The fact that undue interest had been taken \n\n\n\nby   the   offending   police   officials   is   also   clear   from   Ex.   P/10   a \n\n\n\nphotograph   showing   the   ASI   looking   into   the   car.     More \n\n\n\nsignificantly,   however,   PW-12   Sant   Lal,   the   official \n\n\n\nPhotographer   of   the   Delhi   Police,   took   two   photographs   Ex. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">PW12/28   and   PW12/29   of   the   driver&#x27;s   seat   from   very   close \n\n\n\nrange   but   they   show   no   pistol   or   empty   shells.

It is \n\n\n\nalso   relevant   that   the   pistol   had   been   sent   to   the   Central \n\n\n\nForensic   Science   Laboratory   but   PW-46   S.K.Chadha   who \n\n\n\nexamined  the   weapon,   could   find  no  identifiable   finger   prints \n\n\n\nthereon.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">      The   cumulative   effect   of   the   above   evidence   reveals   the \n\n\n\nstarkly   patent   fact   that   the   defence   story   projected   was   a \n\n\n\npalpably   false   one   and   the   police   officials   involved   having \n\n\n\nrealized   almost   immediately   after   the   incident   (perhaps   on \n\n\n\nquestioning   Tarunpreet   Singh-PW)   that   they   had   made   a \n\n\n\nhorrific   mistake,   immediately   set   about   creating   a   false \n\n\n\ndefence.

In the light \n\n\n\nof the fact that the positive case set up the defence has been \n\n\n\nrejected by the trial court, the High Court as well as by us, the \n\n\n\nquestion of any good faith does not arise.

As already mentioned above, the obligation \n\n\n\nto prove an exception is on the preponderance of probabilities \n\n\n\nbut   it   nevertheless   lies   on   the   defence.

It   is   true   that   the   High   Court   has \n\n\n\nacquitted the appellants of planting the 7.65 mm bore pistol in \n\n\n\nthe car.

It \n\n\n\nwill also be seen that as per the prosecution story, appellants \n\n\n\nSunil   Kumar   and   Subhash   Chand,   had   been   caused   injuries \n\n\n\nby   shots   fired   from   the   weapons   of   Head   Constable   Tej   Pal \n\n\n\nSingh   and   Constable   Kothari   Ram   appellants.     As   per   the \n\n\n\nreport   of   the   CFSL   Ex.P/37F,   the   bullet   recovered   from   the \n\n\n\nperson of Constable Sunil Kumar had been fired from the .380 \n\n\n\nrevolver   of   Head   Constable   Tej   Pal   Singh   and   as   per   the \n\n\n\nevidence of PW-37 Roop Singh, the possibility that the metallic \n\n\n\nbullet   which   was   embedded   on   the   person   of   Constable \n\n\n\nSubhash Chand appellant could be the steel core portion of a \n\n\n\nshattered 7.62 mm bullet of the weapon of Constable Kothari \n\n\n\nRam.     Much   argument   has,   however,   been   made   by   the \n\n\n\nlearned defence counsel on the evidence of PW-37 Roop Singh \n\n\n\nwherein  some  doubt has  been expressed  as  to  the  identity  of \n\n\n\nthe bullet allegedly recovered from the hand of Constable Sunil \n\n\f\n                        Crl.

He stated \n\n\n\nin his examination-in-chief that he had received parcel No.12 \n\n\n\nalong   with   a   covering   letter   dated   7th  April,   1997   referring   to \n\n\n\nthe   bullet   recovered   from   Sunil   Kumar&#x27;s   hand.     He   further \n\n\n\nstated that he had opened the parcel and had found one .380 \n\n\n\ncalibre bullet and no other object therein and that he had re-\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">sealed the bullet in the parcel.  It appears from the evidence of \n\n\n\nPW-37   that   parcel   No.12   was   again   opened   in   Court   and   at \n\n\n\nthat   stage   it   was   found   to   contain   not   only   a   .380   calibre \n\n\n\nbullet   but   also   one   fired   7.65   mm   bullet.     The   witness, \n\n\n\nhowever,   stated   that   when   the   parcel   had   been   received   by \n\n\n\nhim in the Ballistics Department from the Biology Department \n\n\n\nof   the   Laboratory,   the   7.65   mm   bullet   had   not   been  in  it.     A \n\n\n\npointed question was thereafter put to him as to how he could \n\n\n\nexplain the presence of the 7.65 mm bullet in parcel No.12.  In \n\n\n\nanswer to this question, he stated as under:\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      &quot;When   this   parcel   was   opened   on   the   earlier \n\n      hearing and at that time after .380 bullet was \n\n      exhibited   the   other   bullet   i.e.   7.65   mm \n\n      (Ex.PW37/24)   was   found   lying   on   the   table, \n\n      and   so  in  these   circumstances   the   said  7.65 \n\n      mm bullet was exhibited.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">\f\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">                        Crl.

A reply \n\n\n\nthereto   was   filed   by   the   defence   on   the   4th  of   January   2000. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">On   re-examination,   the   witness   suggested   that   the   7.65   mm \n\n\n\nbullet   had   been   mixed   up   with   the   .380   bullet   by   some \n\n\n\nAdvocate   when   the   parcel   had   been   opened   in   Court   on   an \n\n\n\nearlier date during court proceedings.   In the light of the fact \n\n\n\nthat the trial court and the High Court have already held (and \n\n\n\nalso   held   by   us)   that   no   shot   had   been   fired   from   inside   the \n\n\n\ncar   from   the   7.65   mm   pistol,   the   possibility   of   a   7.65   mm \n\n\n\nbullet being in the parcel becomes suspect and it appears that \n\n\n\nsome mischief was being played out.  We must also notice that \n\n\n\nwe are dealing with appellants who are all police officials and \n\n\n\nthe   trial   court   has   clearly   hinted   that   there   appeared   to   be \n\n\n\nsome   connivance   between   the   appellants   and   the \n\n\n\ninvestigation.  In any case, the creation of some confusion vis-\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">`-vis   the   bullets,   is   a   matter   which   would   undoubtedly   help \n\n\n\nthe   defence   and   a   presumption   can   thus   be   raised   that   this \n\n\f\n                       Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                       45</span>\nhad   been   stage \n\n\n\nmanaged  by   the   defence.     This  aspect  too  cannot  be  ignored. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_37\">The argument raised by the learned counsel for the appellants, \n\n\n\ntherefore,   that   the   application   filed   for   clarification   had   been \n\n\n\nwithdrawn as the prosecution was shying away from the truth \n\n\n\nis   not   sustainable   as   this   had   happened   in   the   light   of   the \n\n\n\nclarification given by PW-37 Roop Singh.   Nothing ominous or \n\n\n\nsinister can be read into this.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">      The   learned   counsel   has   also   challenged   the   recovery   of \n\n\n\nthe bullet from the ashes of Jagjit Singh.   This submission is \n\n\n\nbased on the evidence of PW-8 Didar Singh, the elder brother \n\n\n\nof  Jagjit   Singh   and   PW-49   ASI   Ram   Dutt   to   whom   the   bullet \n\n\n\nhad   been  handed   over   by   Didar   Singh   and   the   statements   of \n\n\n\nDr.   G.K.Sharma   and   PW-24   Yashoda   Rani   who   had   X-rayed \n\n\n\nthe dead body and found no image of a bullet therein.   It has \n\n\n\naccordingly been argued that this too was the brainchild of the \n\n\n\nCBI   and   a   crude   attempt   to   inculpate   Constable   Mahavir \n\n\n\nSingh.  The trial court had accepted the prosecution story that \n\n\n\nthis  spent  bullet  had been  recovered from  the   ashes   of Jagjit \n\n\n\nSingh.   This part of the prosecution story has, however, been \n\n\f\n                        Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                        46</span>\nrejected   by   the \n\n\n\nHigh   Court   by   observing   that   the   trial   court   had   ignored   the \n\n\n\nevidence   on   this   score   as   Didar   Singh   PW-8   had   nowhere \n\n\n\nstated   that   he   had   picked   up   of   a   bullet   from   the   ashes   and \n\n\n\nhanded   it   over   to   Sub-Inspector   Ram   Dutt   and   more \n\n\n\nparticularly as the two doctors who had X-rayed the dead body \n\n\n\nhad found no trace of a bullet.  We endorse this finding of the \n\n\n\nHigh Court in the light of the uncertain evidence on this score \n\n\n\nbut to allege that the CBI officials had a hand in planting the \n\n\n\nbullet,   is   unwarranted.     It   will   be   seen   from   the   evidence   of \n\n\n\nPW-49 Ram Dutt that Jagjit Singh had been cremated on the \n\n\n\n2nd  of  April   1999   and   the   bullet   had   been  recovered   the   next \n\n\n\nday when the ashes were being collected and had been handed \n\n\n\nover   to   him   the   same   day   and   that   it   had   thereafter   been \n\n\n\nsealed and deposited in the Malkhana.  The CBI, at this stage, \n\n\n\nhad   nothing   to   do   with   the   recovery   of   the   bullet   as   PW-72 \n\n\n\nInspector Sumit Kumar of the CBI had taken it into possession \n\n\n\nduly sealed vide Memo Ex. PW49/A dated 11th  April, 1999.   It \n\n\n\nis   also   relevant   that   the   weapon   bearing   Butt   No.518   carried \n\n\n\nby   Head   Constable   Mahavir   Singh   had   been   seized   by   the \n\n\f\n                        Crl. Appeal No.2231/2009 etc.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                       47</span>\nDelhi   Police   on \n\n\n\nthe 1st  April 1997 itself and the CBI did not have access to it \n\n\n\nwhich   could   have   enabled   it   to   create   any   false   evidence   on \n\n\n\nthis   score.     We   must   also   recall   that   the   police   party \n\n\n\ncomprised   15   personnel.     Only   10   who   played   an   active   role \n\n\n\nhad   been   prosecuted.     This   background   points   to   a   fair \n\n\n\ninvestigation.     We   are,   therefore,   of   the   opinion   that   no   fault \n\n\n\nwhatsoever can be found in the investigation made by the CBI.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_39\">      The   primary   argument,   however,   of   the   appellants   that \n\n\n\neven   assuming   the   prosecution   story   to   be   the   correct,   there \n\n\n\nwas   no   common   intention   on   the   part   of   the   appellants   to \n\n\n\ncommit murder, must now be examined.  Highlighting the role \n\n\n\nattributed to the two appellants ACP Rathi and Inspector Anil \n\n\n\nKumar, it has been submitted that ACP Rathi had not fired at \n\n\n\nthe car and was in fact sitting 20 meters away from the firing \n\n\n\nsite.     Mr.   Lalit,   appearing   for   Inspector   Anil   Kumar,   has   also \n\n\n\nsupported   this   argument   and   submitted   that   Inspector   Anil \n\n\n\nKumar too had not fired at the car and the only role attributed \n\n\n\nto him was a knock at Jagjit Singh&#x27;s window calling upon him \n\n\n\nto step out but instead of doing so he had fired back leading to \n\n\f\n                        Crl.

It   bears   reiteration   that   the   trial   court   had \n\n\n\nconvicted   all   the   appellants   on   the   primary   charge   under \n\n\n\nSection 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_227\">section 120-B</a> of the IPC, but the High \n\n\n\nCourt has acquitted them under that provision and convicted \n\n\n\nthem   under   Section   302/<a href=\"/doc/193921/\" id=\"a_228\">34</a>   etc.   of   the   <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_229\">IPC</a>   instead.     This \n\n\n\naspect   would   have   to   be   examined   in   the   background   of   the \n\n\n\ndefence story that had been projected and as the entire police \n\n\n\noperation   had   been   conducted   in   a   secret   manner   as   no \n\n\n\noutsider   had   any   access   to   what   is   going   on   in   the   matter \n\n\f\n                        Crl.

Admittedly, the target was Mohd. Yaseen, concededly \n\n\n\na   notorious   criminal   with   a   bounty   on   his   head,   as   he   had \n\n\n\nbeen   involved   in   a   large   number   of   very   serious   criminal \n\n\n\nmatters.  The incident happened on account of a mistake as to \n\n\n\nthe identity of Jagjit Singh who could pass off as a Muslim and \n\n\n\nit   is   nobody&#x27;s   case   that   the   police   party   had   intended   to \n\n\n\neliminate Jagjit Singh and his friends.  The courts below have \n\n\n\nbeen very clear on this score and have observed that keeping \n\n\n\nin mind the background in which the incident happened, that \n\n\n\nit   was   not   the   outcome   of   an   act   in   self   defence   but   was \n\n\n\npursuant to the common intention to kill Mohd. Yaseen.   The \n\n\n\npossibility   of   a   hefty   cash   reward   and   accelerated   promotion \n\n\n\nacted   as   a   catalyst   and   spurred   the   police   party   to   rash   and \n\n\n\nhasty  action.     As to   the   role   of ACP   Rathi  and   Inspector  Anil \n\n\n\nKumar, the High  Court has  found  that it was Rathi  who was \n\n\n\nthe   leader   of  the   police   party   in   his  capacity   as  the   ACP   and \n\n\n\ntherefore, it was not necessary for him to be in the forefront of \n\n\n\nthe   attack   on  the   Esteem   car   and   Inspector  Anil   Kumar   who \n\n\n\nhad   admittedly   knocked   at   the   window   could   be   treated \n\n\f\n                        Crl.

We have  seen the site  plan \n\n\n\nand notice that ACP Rathi was sitting   in his Gypsy about 15 \n\n\n\nmeters away from the car when the incident happened.  It has \n\n\n\ncome   in   evidence   that   when   Inspector   Anil   Kumar   had \n\n\n\nconveyed   the   fact   of   Jagjit   Singh&#x27;s   and   Tarunpreet   Singh&#x27;s \n\n\n\npresence   at   the   Mother   Dairy   Booth   at   Patparganj,   the   ACP \n\n\n\nhad   got   together   a   police   party   of   heavily   armed   officers, \n\n\n\nbriefed them, and they had thereafter moved on to Connaught \n\n\n\nPlace.     It   has   been   found   as   a   matter   of   fact   that   when \n\n\n\nInspector Anil Kumar had followed the Car to the Dena Bank, \n\n\n\nJagjit   Singh   had   been   left   behind   in   the   car   alone   for   quite \n\n\n\nsome   time   but   Inspector   Anil   Kumar   and   his   two   associates \n\n\n\nhad   made   absolutely   no   attempt   to   apprehend   him   at   that \n\n\n\nstage   or   to   counter   check   his   identity   as   the   Inspector   had \n\n\n\nMohd.

It   is   the   case   of   the \n\n\n\ndefence   that   the   car   had   been   surrounded   to   immobilize   the \n\n\n\ninmates   and   to   prevent   them   from   escaping   and   that   it   was \n\n\n\nwith this intention that Inspector Anil Kumar had knocked on \n\n\n\nthe driver&#x27;s window asking the inmates to get out but he had \n\n\n\nbeen answered by firing from inside the car.  This plea cannot \n\n\n\nbe accepted  for the  reason that the defence  has already been \n\n\n\nrejected   by   us.     Moreover   PW-37   testified   that   there   were   no \n\n\n\nbullet marks on the tyres and they remained intact even after \n\n\n\nthe   incident,   despite   34   shots   being   fired   at   the   car,   and   29 \n\n\n\nbullet   holes,   most   of   them   of   entry,   thereon.     On   the   other \n\n\n\nhand, the appellants presupposed that one of the inmates was \n\n\n\nMohd. Yaseen, the wanted criminal and that the firing was so \n\n\n\ninsensitive  and indiscriminate that  some  of the  shots  had hit \n\n\n\nConstables Subhash Chand and Sunil Kumar.  The post-facto \n\n\n\nconduct   of   the   appellants   is   again   relevant.     Inspector   Anil \n\n\n\nKumar   gave   a   report   on   the   1st  April   1997   immediately   after \n\n\n\nthe incident, which was followed by a report by ACP Rathi the \n\n\n\nnext day giving the counter version.   This has been found by \n\n\f\n                        Crl.

The High Court was, therefore, justified \n\n\n\nin   holding   that   in   the   light   of   the   above   facts,   it   was   not \n\n\n\nnecessary to assign a specific role to each individual appellant \n\n\n\nas the firing at the Car was undoubtedly with a clear intent to \n\n\n\nannihilate those in it and was resorted to in furtherance of the \n\n\n\ncommon   intention   of   all   the   appellants.

This   argument   is \n\n\n\nbased   on   a   clear   misconception   and   does   not   take   into \n\n\n\naccount   the   normal   tendency   of   a   person   at   a   crime   scene, \n\n\n\n(more   particularly   where   indiscriminate   gun   fire   had   been \n\n\n\nresorted to) would be to run far and away.

We have also perused the large number \n\n\n\nof   photographs   of   the   site   and   see   that   the   crowd   that   had \n\n\n\ngathered   after   the   shooting,   was   perfectly   disciplined   and \n\n\n\nkeeping a reasonable distance away from the Esteem car and \n\n\n\nthe   dead   bodies   lying   around   it.     Admittedly   also,   there   is \n\n\n\nabsolutely   no   evidence   with   regard   to   the   defence   taken   by \n\n\n\nConstable Mahavir Singh.   An effort could have been made by \n\n\n\nthe defence  to elicit some  information  about the behaviour  of \n\n\n\nthe   crowd   from   the   policemen   and   the   Statesman   employees \n\n\n\nwho   had   appeared   as   prosecution   witnesses.     Not   a   single \n\n\n\nquestion was, however, put to them on this aspect.       We are \n\n\n\ntherefore of the opinion that the story projected by him in his \n\n\n\n313   statement   is   not   supported   by   any   evidence   whatsoever. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\">His   case,   therefore,   cannot   be   distinguished   from   the   other \n\n\n\nseven accused who had admittedly fired at the car.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">      We   have   already   dealt   with   Mr.   Balasubramaniam&#x27;s \n\n\n\narguments in  the case of Inspector  Anil Kumar who has filed \n\n\n\nCriminal   Appeal   No.2484/2009   while   dealing   with   the \n\n\f\n                           Crl.
