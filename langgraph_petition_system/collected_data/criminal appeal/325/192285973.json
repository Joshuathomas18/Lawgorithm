She took them to the Police\n\nStation Dolriya (for short the Police Station).\n\nThereafter, she made him sit in her government\n\nresidence, which is on the campus of the police\n\nstation. There, she got a letter written by him\n\nforcing   him   to     admit      that    he    had        sexual\n\nintercourse with Gomti Bai several times in the\n\npast and he had also intercourse with her today.\n\nLater, she had gone to the police station.

A\n\nshort while later, acquitted accused Maluk Chand\n\ncame. She asked him to take money from the\n\ncomplainant. Thereupon, he received the money\n\nfrom him.

She, therefore, asked\n\n         Rajendra    Singh     Rajput   (DW-2),      who    was\n\n         attached to the police station at the relevant\n\n         time, to arrange a mobile phone for her time-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">         being   use.

Thereupon, the complainant lodged\n\n       the complaint Ex.P-18 making false allegations\n\n       against her that she has demanded bribe from\n\n       him. If the said defence of accused Archana is\n\n       read vis-a-vis the above admissions made by\n\n       the complainant, it is clear like day time that\n\n       when accused Archana did not bow down to\n\n       their pressure, the complainant made the false\n\n       complaint against her.

But this factor itself does not\n\nweaken the prosecution case because of the availability of\n\noverwhelming evidence on record.

There is no gainsaying the fact that the tainted money\n\nis not recovered from the possession of accused Archana.

Upon     perusal   of     the    examination-in-chief            of\n\ncomplainant Yaswant Singh (PW-10), we find that it is almost\n\nreiteration of averments made by him in his written complaint\n\nEx.P-18. Hence, there is no need to reproduce the same.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_74\">26.

Constable   Devi     Singh   took   Gomti     Bai    and\n\nKanchhedi Lal (PW-5) by a bus. Thus, he has improved his\n\nversion in his court statement. The complainant in his\n\ncomplaint Ex.P-18 and examination-in-chief has stated that\n\non 15.08.2003 itself accused Archana took his mobile phone\n\nas    security against the bribe money to be given by him,\n\nwhereas he has stated in paras 1 and 23 of his evidence that\n\naccused Archana took his mobile phone from him two or three\n\ndays later from 15.08.2003 and while taking his mobile\n\nphone, she told him that his mobile phone was out of order\n\nand that she had sent the same for repairs. She also told him\n\nthat she would return his mobile phone after her own mobile\n\nphone being repaired. In our considered opinion, these are\n\nmaterial contradictions, which affects the truthfulness of the\n\ncomplainant&#x27;s evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">27.     The complainant has stated in his complaint Ex.P-18\n\nand examination-in-chief that on 15.08.2003 accused Archana\n\nmade him sit in his government residence for three long\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                 (36)</span>\n                                          Criminal Appeal No. 2325/2006\n                                          Criminal Appeal No. 1398/2007\n\nhours. At that time, the mobile phone was with him. He has\n\nadmitted that during the said period he had not made a call\n\nthrough his mobile phone to any person of his acquittance\n\nintimating that accused Archana has forcibly made him sit in\n\nher   government   residence.     Upon   reading    of   his   entire\n\nevidence, we could say that his above conduct is very\n\nabnormal because he is schemer and wily as per evidence\n\navailable on record. Had he been detained by accused\n\nArchana in her government residence for such a long hours,\n\nhe would have informed politically influential persons of his\n\narea about his wrongful detention by accused Archana. There\n\nis no other evidence on record in this regard. In the\n\ncircumstances, we are of the view that his aforesaid evidence\n\nis not reliable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">28.     The complainant has stated in his complaint Ex.P-18\n\nas well as in his evidence that accused Archana got a letter\n\nEx.P-20 written by him after putting pressure upon him to the\n\neffect that he had sexual intercourse several times with Gomti\n\nBai in past and he had sexual intercourse today itself (i.e.\n\n15.08.2003) with her. The language of the letter is not such\n\nthat he has admitted to have committed rape upon Gomti Bai.\n\nAs per evidence of Gomti Bai (PW-4), she is a 33 years old\n\nwoman and mother of two growing children. She has denied\n\nin her statement having written the letter Ex.P-13. Moreover,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                               (37)</span>\n                                         Criminal Appeal No. 2325/2006\n                                         Criminal Appeal No. 1398/2007\n\nthe language of the letter Ex.P-13 is not such that the\n\ncomplainant committed rape upon her. At the most upon the\n\ntenor of letter, it can be said that it is a case of consensual\n\nsex for which the complainant could not be prosecuted in the\n\ncourt of law for the charge of rape. Hence, we strongly doubt\n\nthat accused Archana would blackmail the complainant upon\n\nthe letter Ex.P-13 threatening him that she would register a\n\nrape case against him upon the said letter in case of non-\n\npayment of bribe by him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">29.    The complainant in para 20 of his evidence has\n\nadmitted that he had not met Gomti Bai again the period\n\nbetween 15.08.2003 to 05.09.2003, the date of lodging the\n\nwritten report Ex.P-18 with the S.P. Hence, the complainant&#x27;s\n\nevidence against accused Archana that she got a report\n\nforcibly written by Gomti Bai against him is false.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">30.

As per the order-sheet dated 18.09.2006 of the trial\n\nCourt, it appears that the complainant came from jail to\n\nrecord his evidence in the case.

Taking   into   account         the     aforesaid      attendant\n\ncircumstances and criminal background of the complainant,\n\nwe feel unsafe to rely upon his evidence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">31.

There is evidence on record that the\n\ncomplainant had gone to his residence before going to the\n\ngovernment residence of accused Archana in the night of\n\n05.09.2003. As already stated that Gomti Bai and Kanchhedi\n\nLal have denied that the letters Ex.P-13 and Ex.P-14 are in\n\ntheir   handwritings   or   bear     their   signatures.    Under     the\n\ncircumstances, there is a strong possibility that when the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                               (41)</span>\n                                             Criminal Appeal No. 2325/2006\n                                             Criminal Appeal No. 1398/2007\n\ngovernment residences of accused Archana and acquitted\n\naccused Maluk Chand were being searched for recovery of the\n\ntainted money, someone on the side of prosecution has kept\n\nthe aforesaid letters secretly in the drawer to implicate\n\naccused Archana. In view of the aforestated evidence and\n\ncircumstances, we are of the view that it is unsafe to draw a\n\nconclusion on the basis of the letters that accused Archana\n\nhad demanded illegal gratification from the complainant.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">36.    The complainant has admitted in para 23 of his\n\nstatement that when he had given his mobile phone to\n\naccused Archana, she told him that her mobile phone had\n\nbeen in disorder and that she had sent it for repairs. In the\n\nlight of aforesaid admission of the complainant, the recovery\n\nof his mobile phone from the government residence of\n\naccused Archana is not sufficient evidence to hold that she\n\ndemanded bribe from the complainant keeping it as security.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">37.    Ex.D-7 and Ex.D-8 are the Rojnamcha entries dated\n\n15.08.2003 of the police station, which is the material date in\n\nthe case. There is no evidence on record to hold even\n\nremotely that these entries are tampered with and anti-dated.\n\nMoreover,   their   correctness   is   not     challenged      by    the\n\nprosecution in the cross-examination of Constable Lachhi Ram\n\n(DW-1), who brought relevant Rojnamcha record in the trial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                 (42)</span>\n                                            Criminal Appeal No. 2325/2006\n                                            Criminal Appeal No. 1398/2007\n\nCourt for proving the entries. In normal course, Rojnamcha\n\nentries are reliable as they are records of day to day working\n\nof a particular police station until they are disproved by\n\ncogent evidence. Hence, the aforesaid entries are reliable. It\n\nis mentioned therein without any overwriting that accused\n\nArchana with police force in government vehicle bearing\n\nregistration No. MP-03-1700 left the police station at 12:40\n\np.m. for the arrest of accused Rakesh Rajput against whom a\n\ncriminal   case   at   crime   No.72/2003    is   registered     under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1599401/\" id=\"a_65\">Sections 341</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_66\">376</a>, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_67\">506</a> and <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_68\">34</a> of the IPC and she brought\n\nhim in the state of arrest at police station at 05:50 p.m. As\n\nper the evidence of the complainant appearing in para 18,\n\naccused Archana met him on 15.08.2003 at the place at about\n\n03:00 p.m. to 03:30 p.m. It has been held by us that the\n\naforesaid entries are reliable. Hence, these entries lay bare\n\nthe falsehood of the aforesaid statement of the complainant.\n\nIn para 28, the complainant has admitted that he knows\n\nRakesh Rajput as he belongs to his caste. It is the defence of\n\naccused Archana that the complainant and one Chandan\n\nSingh Parihar, who is a leader of BJP party of Dolriya village,\n\npressurized her not to arrest him. She refused to give in their\n\npressure. Her refusal made them revengeful. In retaliation,\n\nthe complainant has implicated her taking the advantage of\n\nhis mobile phone being with her at the relevant time. In the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                (43)</span>\n                                            Criminal Appeal No. 2325/2006\n                                            Criminal Appeal No. 1398/2007\n\nfacts and circumstances of the case, her defence appears to\n\nbe most probable. Therefore, we hold that there exists a\n\nstrong possibility of false implication of accused Archana by\n\nthe complainant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_87\">38.      Upon the perusal of entire evidence on record, we\n\nhave found that learned trial Judge had not confronted and\n\nsought    her   explanation   over    the   admissions      made      by\n\nacquitted accused Maluk Chand in his examination under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 313</a> of the Cr.P.C. Hence, the learned trial Judge has\n\ncommitted a grave error in law by using his admissions in\n\nestablishing that she has demanded illegal gratification from\n\nthe complainant. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"612149\" id=\"span_47\">In this regard, reference can also be made\n\nto the decisions rendered in <a href=\"/doc/612149/\" id=\"a_70\">Zwinglee Ariel Vs. State of M.P.</a>\n\n(AIR 1954 SC 15), Narayan Swami Vs. State of Maharashtra\n\n(AIR 1968 SC 609) and Raju Paul Vs. State of H.P. (1985 CRL.\n\nL.J. 1501 H.P.).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">39.      It is expected of a panch witness of a trap case under\n\nthe Act to overhear the conversation between the bribe-giver\n\nand bribe-taker and to see on the sly the bribe-giver giving\n\nbribe money to bribe-taker. We find that the evidence of\n\npanch witness Ajay Kumar Shrivastava is totally silent on the\n\naforesaid material points. On the other hand, it is evident\n\nthat he remained seated throughout the material time in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                               (44)</span>\n                                        Criminal Appeal No. 2325/2006\n                                        Criminal Appeal No. 1398/2007\n\ngovernment vehicle. Hence, his evidence has no evidentiary\n\nvalue at all.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">40.    Navratan Singh (PW-2) and K.S. Sisodiya (PW-9) are\n\npolice officers. There is no denying the fact that they are\n\nconnected with the investigation of the case, therefore, it is\n\nbut natural that they would support the prosecution case.\n\nDespite that there is nothing in their evidence by which the\n\ninference may be drawn that accused Archana had demanded\n\nbribe money from the complainant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">41.    In the aforesaid close analysis of evidence on record,\n\nwe hold that the learned trial Judge has committed gross\n\nerrors in law and on facts that the prosecution has proved\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt the factum of demand of illegal\n\ngratification by accused Archana from the complainant on the\n\nbasis of his sole oral evidence. Hence, the recovery of tainted\n\nmoney from the possession of acquitted accused Maluk Chand\n\nhas no evidentiary value insofar as it relates to accused\n\nArchana&#x27;s case. Consequently, his conviction and sentence\n\nrecorded by the learned trial Judge are unsustainable in law\n\nand liable to be set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\">42.    Now, the next question falls for our determination is\n\nwhether the acquitted accused Maluk Chand has abetted\n\naccused Archana in demanding illegal gratification from the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                  (45)</span>\n                                            Criminal Appeal No. 2325/2006\n                                            Criminal Appeal No. 1398/2007\n\ncomplainant at any material point of time?\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1340977\" id=\"span_50\">43.    As we have already held that the prosecution has\n\nfailed to prove that accused Archana has demanded illegal\n\ngratification    as a motive or reward from the complainant.\n\nTherefore, upon the said finding itself the charge against\n\nacquitted accused Maluk Chand under <a href=\"/doc/1882893/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 12</a> of the Act\n\nwould fail squarely (see-G.V. <a href=\"/doc/1340977/\" id=\"a_72\">Nanjundiah Vs. State (Delhi\n\nAdministration</a>) 1987 (Supp) SCC 266).</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">44.    The complainant in para 53 of his statement has\n\nhonestly admitted that acquitted accused Maluk Chand had\n\nnever talked him as to the demand of bribe on behalf of\n\naccused Archana. Having gone through the entire evidence on\n\nrecord, we find that there is no evidence on the issue that\n\nany material point of time acquitted accused Maluk Chand\n\nhad associated with accused Archana in demanding bribe\n\nfrom the complainant or abetting him to give her bribe. The\n\ncomplainant in para 7 has stated that on the fateful night in\n\nhis presence accused Archana asked the receiver of her\n\ndirections on wireless set to send a person without naming to\n\nher government residence from the police station. This means\n\nthat she had not called by name to send acquitted accused\n\nMaluk Chand to her government residence. It has not come in\n\nthe   evidence    of   the   complainant   that   he   had     a   little\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                  (46)</span>\n                                               Criminal Appeal No. 2325/2006\n                                               Criminal Appeal No. 1398/2007\n\nconversation    with   accused      Archana    in   the    presence      of\n\nacquitted accused Maluk Chand. Therefore, it cannot be held\n\nthat through their conversation, he had come to know that\n\naccused Archana had demanded bribe from the complainant\n\nand the money which he was to receive from the complainant\n\nat her instance being bribe money. Hence, we are of the view\n\nthat from the factual aspect of the case, it is proved that\n\nacquitted accused Maluk Chand had innocently taken money\n\nfrom the complainant upon the direction of accused Archana.\n\nHence, the commission of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1882893/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 12</a> of the Act\n\nby acquitted accused Maluk Chand is not proved.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">45.    In the examination under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 313</a> of the Cr.P.C.\n\nacquitted accused Maluk Chand in reply to question No.78 has\n\nstated that at the relevant time he was present at the police\n\nstation. Havaldar, Gendalal told him that accused Archana had\n\ndirected him to send someone to her government residence.\n\nThereupon,     he   went   there.       He   took   money      from    the\n\ncomplainant at her instance without knowing that it being\n\nbribe money. Hence, taking money by acquitted accused\n\nMaluk Chand upon the direction of accused Archana without\n\nknowing the background facts cannot be equated with the\n\nabetment as per the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1882893/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 12</a> of the Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">46.    It is a settled proposition of law that any admission\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                              (47)</span>\n                                        Criminal Appeal No. 2325/2006\n                                        Criminal Appeal No. 1398/2007\n\nmade by an accused in his examination under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 313</a> of\n\nthe Cr.P.C. cannot be made sole basis for conviction of the\n\noffence with which he is charged. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"469763\" id=\"span_53\">In this regard, reference\n\nmay be had to the decisions rendered in <a href=\"/doc/469763/\" id=\"a_77\">Mohan Singh Vs.\n\nPrem Singh</a> (AIR 2002 SC 3582), Sanatan Naskar &amp; Another\n\nVs.
