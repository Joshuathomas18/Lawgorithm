Criminal Appeal No. 781 of 2002, D.B.  Criminal  Appeal  No.\n718 of 2002 and D.B. Criminal Appeal No. 105 of 2003. Criminal  Appeals  No.\n1535-1538 of 2004 are filed by PW-4 Balbir and Criminal  Appeal  Nos.  1539,\n1540 and 1541 of 2004 are filed  by  the  State  of  Rajasthan  against  the\nacquittal of the  accused.  Since  these  appeals  arise  out  of  the  same\njudgment they are being disposed of by this common judgment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">Gist of the prosecution case:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">2.     Deceased Krishna Gir (also referred to  as  ‘Krishna  Gir’)  was  the\nHead Priest of ‘Balakdera Ashram’  situated at Hissar in  Haryana.   Krishna\nGir was also having ultimate supervision  and  control  over  other  Ashrams\nassociated with this Ashram. Baba Lal  Gir  Ashram  at  village  Rampura  in\nRajasthan  where the incident occurred was also one of  such  Ashrams  which\nwas under  the  supervision  and  control  of  ‘Balakdera  Ashram’.  Amongst\nothers, one Pokhar-Khedi Ashram situated at  village  Pokhar-Khedi  in  Jind\nDistrict of  Haryana  and  its  Priest  were  also  under  the  control  and\nsupervision of ‘Balakdera Ashram’.  Pokhar-Khedi Ashram had about 100  acres\nof land.  In the past, it was  managed  by  its  Priest  Mangeram.    Priest\nMangeram transferred that land in the names of his nephew Joragir and  other\nmembers of his family.  He also executed a  Will  in  respect  of  the  said\nland. When this fact came to  the  knowledge  of  Krishna  Gir  through  the\nvillagers of Pokhar-Khedi, he filed a civil suit  for  cancellation  of  the\ntransfer of said land made by Priest Mangeram. The civil  suit  was  decreed\nin favour of Krishna Gir.  The decree  was  maintained  by  the  Punjab  and\nHaryana High Court as well as by the Supreme Court.  During the pendency  of\nthe said litigation,   Priest Mangeram  died. Joragir, the nephew of  Priest\nMangeram, claimed to be his successor   but  he  was  not  allowed  to  take\ncharge. Subsequently, Krishna Gir was appointed as  Priest  of  Pokhar-Khedi\nAshram. Krishna Gir  recovered the possession of the  land  of  Pokhar-Khedi\nAshram in execution of the  decree.  Because  of  this  dispute   there  was\nenmity between Krishna Gir and the accused.  An  attempt  was  made  on  the\nlife of Krishna Gir in Jind Court premises.   The  accused  party  tried  to\nregain  possession  of  the  land.   In  that  dispute   one   child   died.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">Thereafter, Krishna Gir was assaulted with knife  at  Balakdera.   Cases  in\nrelation to all these incidents  are  stated  to  be  pending  in  different\ncourts in Haryana State.  It is the prosecution case  that  on  12.7.2000  a\nconspiracy was hatched in the house of  accused  Hoshiyar  Singh  at  Pokhar\nKhedi whereby Hoshiyar Singh, Rajmal, Jage Gir, Joragir,  Vazir,  Sohan  Gir\nand Lichman conspired to kill  Krishna  Gir.   In   pursuance  of  the  said\nconspiracy Krishna Gir  and his disciple Sewanand  Gir  were  shot  dead  on\n23.7.2000 at 11.05 A.M at Baba Lalgiri Ashram in village Rampura.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">3.    FIR relating to the incident:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      On 23/07/2000  at 11.05 a.m. PW-23 Lakhma Ram Rathore,   Station House\nOfficer of RPS, Hamirvas, Rajasthan received  an   intimation   from  Police\nStation In-charge, Rajgarh, District Churu, Rajasthan that there was  firing\nat the Ashram of Baba Lal Giri in Rampura Village.  On  the  basis  of  this\ninformation, PW-23 Lakhma Ram Rathore along with one ASI  and  police  force\nreached the site of occurrence  where  PW-1  Puranmal  submitted  a  written\nreport.  According to this  report,  Baba  Lalgiri  Ashram  is  situated  in\nvillage Rampura, Tehsil Rajgarh, District Churu, Rajasthan and  there  is  a\n‘Samadhi’ of  Baba Lalgiri. The Ashram was under the supervision  of  Priest\nMangal  Gir.  Every  year,  at  the  Samadhi,  on  the  occasion  of   death\nanniversary of Baba Lalgiri, a ‘Yagya’ was being performed.   Following  the\nsaid tradition, on 17/7/2000,  a ‘Yagya’ was  arranged at the  Baba  Lalgiri\nAshram.   The  ‘Yagya’  was  scheduled  to  culminate  on   23/7/2000.    On\n23/7/2000, a community lunch  was  in  progress.     Number  of  Saints  and\ncommunity people  had  gathered  to  take  part  in  this  ‘Yagya’.   Priest\nKrishna Gir was supervising the ‘Yagya’.   Priest Krishna  Gir  was  sitting\nalone on a wooden  bench  in  the  Satsang  Hall  of  Baba  Lalgiri  Ashram.\nDisciple Sewanand  was sitting on a mat  at a distance of 2  feet  from  the\nwooden bench. Some other villagers including  PW-4  Balbir  Singh  and  PW-5\nPratap Singh were sitting at a distance of 10 feet from  the  wooden  bench.\nThe Priest  Mangal Gir was sitting  near  the  gate  of  the  Ashram.   PW-1\nPuranmal (informant) was sitting in the store room of  the  Ashram.    PW-10\nUmmed Singh of Beri village was also sitting  in  the  Ashram.  People  were\nmoving around for paying their respect to  Krishna Gir.  All  of  a  sudden,\nbetween 10.30 a.m to 10.45 a.m,  two persons  armed with fire  arms  entered\nthe Satsang Hall from the rear gate of the Ashram.  One of them was  wearing\npant and bush shirt and another was in kurta pyjama. The  man  wearing  pant\nand bush shirt fired at  Krishna Gir.   Resultantly,   Krishna  Gir  started\nbleeding  profusely.  Sewanand  tried  to  grab  the  person  who  fired  at\nKrishna Gir.  Then the man wearing kurta  payjama  fired  at  Sewanand  with\nintention to kill him. Consequently, Sewanand also  became  unconscious  and\nfell down. Seeing this, PW-1 Puranmal, PW-10 Ummed Singh and  Priest  Mangal\nGir   raised cries and ran after  the  assailants.  They  noticed  one  more\nperson  standing at the rear gate armed with a double-barrel gun.  This  was\nalso witnessed by PW-12 Jagdish Prasad,  Prajapat  of  village  Rampura  and\nBaba Samundra Gir of Bhiwani. All these three persons ran  towards  the  car\nwhich was parked on the road. One person was standing near the  parked  car.\nThe man armed with double-barrel gun fired in the air  after  reaching  near\nthe car.  Those four persons sat in the  car  and  escaped  towards  railway\nstation.   This was witnessed by PW-9 Veer Singh and Krishan Singh.   Manish\nSingh  noted the number of car parked on the  road  as  HR-26-G-8928   which\nwas of Ceilo make  and of Grey colour.  Krishna Gir and Sewanand were  taken\nto ‘Bedwal Nursing Home’  at  Pilani  in  injured  state  by  two  different\nvehicles. Sewanand (‘deceased Sewanand’) died on the way.   PW-2  Dr.  Tarun\nBedwal of ‘Bedwal Nursing Home’  after  giving  first  aid  to  Krishna  Gir\nadvised to take Krishna  Gir   either    to  Hissar  or  Delhi  for  further\ntreatment. Krishna Gir was taken to CMC Hospital, Hissar where he  succumbed\nto the injuries.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">4.    At 12.30 p.m. report was forwarded to Police Station, Hameervas by PW-\n23 Lakhma Ram Rathore through Constable PW-18 Kunad Ram, which was  recorded\nby PW-19 Sugan Singh at 2.00 p.m. as Case  No.130/2000  under  Section  302,\n307, 120-B read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 34</a> of IPC and <a href=\"/doc/1507082/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 3</a> read  with  <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_3\">Section  25</a>\nof the Arms Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">5.

A7, A10 and A11 were charged under Sections 148 and 302 read  with\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 149</a> of the IPC. The prosecution, in support of  its  case,  examined\nas many as 31 witnesses (PW-1 to PW-31).  No defence evidence  was  adduced.\nIn their statements recorded under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_15\">Section  313</a>  of  the  Code  of  Criminal\nProcedure, (for short, “the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_16\">Cr.P.C</a>.”), the appellants stated that they  were\ninnocent.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">6.      The trial court convicted  A1 and A2 under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_17\">Sections  120B</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_18\">148</a>  and\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_19\">302</a>  of the IPC for committing the murder of   Krishna  Gir  and   Sewanand.\nThey were sentenced to death for offence punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_20\">Section  302</a>  of\nthe IPC.

Gist of the submissions on behalf of appellant-Balbir.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">i)    The prosecution case  basically  hinges  upon  the  evidence  of  PW-3\n      Prithvi Gir, PW-4 Balbir Singh and PW-5 Pratap Singh.  The High  Court\n      wrongly overlooked their evidence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">ii)   PW-2 Dr. Bedwal had testified that on 23/07/2000 deceased Krishna  Gir\n      was brought by PW-3 Prithvi Gir at his nursing  home.   At  that  time\n      deceased Krishna Gir was conscious and was in a position to speak.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">iii)  PW-3 Prithvi Gir stated that deceased Krishna Gir  was  taken  to  the\n      hospital of PW-2 Dr. Bedwal and Krishna Gir made dying declaration  in\n      the car.  PW-3 Prithvi Gir also stated that deceased Krishna Gir  told\n      him that he was shot at by accused Vazir and his disciple Sewanand was\n      shot at by accused-Joragir.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">iv)    Eyewitnesses  PW-4  Balbir  Singh  and   PW-5   Pratap   Singh   have\n      corroborated PW-3 Prithvi Gir.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">v)    PW-3 Prithvi Gir gave detailed narration of the motive as well as  the\n      earlier two attempts made by the accused to kill deceased Krishna Gir.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">       He stated that the accused had grudge against deceased Krishna Gir as\n      he had taken possession of the Dera Land  situated  at  Village  Pokar\n      Kheri from their uncle Mange Giri.  He also stated that accused  Wazir\n      was a habitual criminal and he  had  made  earlier  attempts  to  kill\n      deceased Krishna Gir.  PW-4  Balbir  Singh,  PW-5  Pratap  Singh  have\n      corroborated PW-3 Prithvi Gir on the aspect of motive.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">vi)   This is a case of strong motive.  The accused had lost  possession  of\n      the  Dera  land  which  was  taken  by  deceased  Krishna  Gir.    The\n      complainant cannot be said to have any ill-design as they were already\n      in possession of the land.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">vii)  The first attempt on the life of deceased Krishna Gir was made in  the\n      year 1996 when the deceased had gone  to  court  to  pursue  the  case\n      against the accused.  The second attempt was  made  in  Hissar  court.\n      This attempt was also unsuccessful.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">viii) The conduct of  accused Vazir speaks for itself  as  he  escaped  from\n      jail and killed deceased Krishna Gir in broad daylight.  Thus, he  has\n      no fear of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">ix)   The High Court has not come to the conclusion that  evidence  of  PW-4\n      Balbir Singh and PW-5 Pratap Singh was, in any way, infirm as  regards\n      the actual occurrence. The High Court  has  unnecessarily  given  much\n      importance to technical flaws in the investigation.  The High  Court’s\n      judgment  is  perverse.    It  has  acquitted  the   accused   thereby\n      completely effacing the cogent  eye-witness  account  of  PW-4  Balbir\n      Singh and PW-5 Pratap Singh, the consistent evidence of  PW-3  Prithvi\n      Giri and other relevant evidence on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">x)    As held in  Swami  Shradanand(2)  alias  Murali  Manohar  Mishra    v.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">      State of Karnataka [1] at the most sentence could have  been  commuted\n      to life imprisonment.  It could have been altered to 20  years  or  30\n      years imprisonment without remission. The  accused  certainly  do  not\n      deserve any leniency.

PW-1  Puranmal  who  was\n      present at the site filed written complaint at 12.30 p.m. and FIR  No.\n      30 of 2000 came to be registered at 2.00 p.m.   Written  complaint  or\n      the FIR does not disclose the names of the  assailants,  though,  they\n      were recorded promptly after the incident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">ii)    There  are  two  prosecution  stories,  one  is  introduced  by  PW-1\n      Puranmal, who has filed the FIR and the other is  introduced  by  PW-3\n      Prithvi Gir, 3 days after the incident.  These two versions differ.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">iii)  PW-1 Puranmal in complaint/FIR specifically says that  the  assailants\n      could be identified if seen.  However, no  identification  parade  was\n      held.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">iv)   Presence of PW-3 Prithvi Gir is not mentioned in  any  contemporaneous\n      documents.

A bare look at the contents  of  the\n      dying declaration show that it is a concocted piece of evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">vi)   The High Court has correctly analysed the  evidence  of  PW-3  Prithvi\n      Gir, PW-4 Balbir Singh and PW-5 Pratap Singh and rightly come  to  the\n      conclusion that the entire evidence  is  concocted  and  suffers  from\n      improvements and contradictions.  The High Court  has  rightly  stated\n      that the story is concocted by the successor of  Balakdera  i.e.  PW-3\n      Prithvi Gir to implicate as many rivals as possible  due  to  existing\n      bitter rivalry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">vii)  The presence of PW-3 Prithvi Gir, PW-4 Balbir Singh  and  PW-5  Pratap\n      Singh at the scene of offence is  not  proved.    After  perusing  the\n      evidence   on  record  and  having  regard  to  the  other   attendant\n      circumstances,  the High Court has  rightly  observed  that  the  said\n      witnesses were not present at all. They  directly  reached  Hissar  at\n      about 4.30 p.m. i.e. much after the death of deceased-Krishna Gir.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">viii) The High Court has rightly acquitted the  accused  after  disbelieving\n      the evidence of PW-3 Prithvi Gir and PW-4 Balbir Singh and PW-5 Pratap\n      Singh.  The High Court’s judgment does not merit any interference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">11.   Gist of submissions on behalf of State of Rajasthan:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">i)    It is an admitted position that there was enmity between the  deceased\n      and the accused on  account  of  land  dispute  which  fact  has  been\n      corroborated by the evidence of PW-3 Prithvi Gir, PW-4  Balbir  Singh,\n      PW-5 Pratap Singh, PW-6 Maha  Singh.    PW-13  SI  Chandrabhan,  PW-17\n      Kartar Singh and PW-26 Randhir Singh  have  confirmed  FIRs  in  cases\n      relating to previous attempts made on the  life  of  deceased  Krishna\n      Gir.

The High Court has wrongly overlooked the evidence of  PW-4\n      Balbir Singh and PW-5 Pratap Singh.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">iv)   There is  nothing  unnatural  about  the  dying  declaration  made  by\n      deceased Krishna Gir.  Deceased Krishna Gir was taken to  hospital  at\n      Pilani by PW-3 Prithvi Gir, which is corroborated by the statement  of\n      PW-2 Dr. Bedwal.   Further, deceased Krishna Gir was with PW-3 Prithvi\n      Gir from 11 a.m. to approximately 3.30 –  3.45  p.m.,  therefore,  the\n      possibility of his making dying declaration during this period  cannot\n      be ruled out as he was alive at Pilani.  This is corroborated by  PW-2\n      Dr. Bedwal who referred deceased Krishna Gir to Hissar hospital.   The\n      High Court fell  into  a  grave  error  in  not  believing  the  dying\n      declaration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">v)    The eye-witnesses were disciples of deceased Krishna Gir  and  have  a\n      reasonable and justified explanation as to why they gave statements on\n      26/7/2000.  The evidence of   these witnesses is corroborated by other\n      evidence on record.   There exists no  discrepancy  in  the  same  and\n      cannot be discarded merely because  they  were  recorded   three  days\n      after the incident.   In  the  circumstances  of  the  case  delay  in\n      recording  statements  of  the  witnesses  does  not   discredit   the\n      prosecution case.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">vi)   The accused were identified by  PW-4  Balbir  Singh  and  PW-5  Pratap\n      Singh in court.

The  High  Court  has  ignored\n      cogent evidence of eye-witnesses and given undue importance  to  minor\n      discrepancies.  The High Court grossly erred in setting aside the well\n      reasoned judgment of the trial court.   This  has  resulted  in  grave\n      miscarriage of justice.  It is, therefore, necessary to set aside  the\n      impugned judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">12.   We are dealing with an appeal against  acquittal.   The  acquittal  is\nnot recorded by the trial court but by the High Court.  We  shall  therefore\nsee whether there were sufficient reasons for the High Court  to  set  aside\nthe conviction.  We must however bear in mind that if the view taken by  the\nHigh Court is a reasonably possible view it should not be disturbed  because\nthe acquittal of the  accused  by  the  High  Court   has  strengthened  the\npresumption of their innocence.  We must also mention that according to  the\nprosecution this is a case of strong motive.  Land disputes between the  two\nsides and earlier attacks made on deceased Krishna Gir have been deposed  to\nby the witnesses.  The High Court has observed that no documentary  evidence\nis produced by the prosecution in support of this case.  However, we  cannot\ndismiss the prosecution  case  of  enmity  between  the  two  sides  lightly\nbecause reference to it is made by several witnesses.  But  that  by  itself\ndoes not help the prosecution.  Just as there is a  possibility  of  murders\nhaving been committed because of motive due  to  enmity,  there  is  also  a\npossibility of false implication of innocent people to settle  past  scores.\nThat is why it is said that motive is a double edged weapon.  We shall  keep\nthis in mind and approach the case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">13.   PW-1 Puranmal a resident of Rampura lodged the FIR  (Ex.P1)  at  12.30\nP.M on 23/7/2000.  He involved four persons as assailants but did  not  name\nthem.  He turned hostile.  We shall advert to the FIR a little later.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_33\">14.   The prosecution relied on two eye-witnesses.   They  are  PW-4  Balbir\nSingh and PW-5  Pratap  Singh.  Before  turning  to  their  evidence  it  is\nnecessary to refer to evidence of PW-3 Prithvi Gir, a disciple  of  deceased\nKrishna Gir who deposed about the  presence  of  the  eye-witnesses  at  the\nscene of offence  and also about the dying  declaration  allegedly  made  by\ndeceased Krishna Gir to him. PW-3 Prithvi Gir is not an eye witness  to  the\nincident.  He stated that deceased Krishna Gir had asked him to come to  the\nDera of Lalgiri Maharaj situate at Rampura on 23/7/2000, as the Yagya  which\ndeceased  Krishna  Gir  was  supervising  was  to  conclude  on  that   day.\nAccordingly, PW-3 Prithvi Gir went to Rampura on  22/7/2000.   According  to\nPW-3 Prithvi Gir at 10.30 in the morning of 23/7/2000 deceased  Krishna  Gir\nwas sitting on a bench in the small Satsang room inside the Dera.   Deceased\nSewanand was sitting at a distance of 2’ from  deceased  Krishna  Gir  on  a\nmat.  PW-4 Balbir Singh, PW-5 Pratap Singh, Hari Singh,  Rajvir  Singh  were\nsitting at a distance of 10’ from deceased  Krishna  Gir.  Deceased  Krishna\nGir’s driver Leela was also sitting there.  PW-3 Prithvi Gir further  stated\nthat at 10.30 in the morning there was a sound of gunfire and stampede.   He\nand Ramgiriji ran towards deceased Krishna Gir.  They saw him lying  on  the\nbench with blood on his body.  Deceased Sewanand  was  lying  on  the  floor\nwith bullet injuries.  PW-3 Prithvi Gir further  stated  that  Sewanand  was\nput in one vehicle and deceased Kirshna Gir was put in a  Sumo  vehicle  for\nbeing taken to hospital at Pilani.  Along with PW-3 Prithvi Gir,   Ramgiriji\nand one person from Rampura were there in the  Sumo  vehicle.  PW-3  Prithvi\nGir further stated that deceased Krishna Gir  was  conscious  and  told  him\nthat he and deceased Sewanand were shot at by Vazir son  of  Hoshiar  Singh,\nCaste Gosain and Joragir son of Dunigir, caste  Gosain,  both  residents  of\nPokarkhedi; both of whom he  recognized  at  the  spot.  According  to  PW-3\nPrithvi Gir deceased Krishna Gir further told him that  in  this  conspiracy\nto kill him Dalelgiri disciple Ram Gir resident  of  Maham,  Hoshiar  Singh,\nRajmal, Jageram resident of Pokarkhedi and Sohangir disciple of  Gulab  Gir,\ncaste Gosain resident of Sukhura, District Jind and Baljit Singh, caste  Jat\n Gosain, village Pokarkhedi  and  Devnand  village  Mahiwal,  caste  Gusain,\npresently employed with Delhi Police are also involved and  Lichman  son  of\nJagannath, caste Gusain, Village Pinjpura, District Kaithal, maternal  uncle\nof Vazir conspired to shoot him.  According to PW-3 Prithvi Gir  the  doctor\nat  the hospital at Pilani asked him to  take  deceased  Krishna  Gir  to  a\nbigger hospital.  He was taken to CMC hospital at  Hissar,  where  he  died.\nDeceased Sewanand died on way to Pilani.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">15.   The prosecution heavily relied on  this  dying  declaration  allegedly\nmade by deceased Krishna Gir to PW-3 Prithvi Gir.  It is submitted that  the\nfact that PW-3 Prithvi Gir took deceased Krishna Gir to hospital  at  Pilani\nis corroborated by PW-2 Dr. Bedwal.  Presence of PW-3 Prithvi Gir  has  also\nbeen mentioned in the inquest proceedings  conducted  by  PW-31  Prem  Singh\nHuda after the death of deceased Krishna Gir. It is submitted that PW-2  Dr.\nBedwal stated  that  deceased  Krishna  Gir  was  in  a  position  to  talk.\nAssuming, however, that deceased Krishna Gir could talk  and  make  a  dying\ndeclaration, the question is how far the narration of  the  facts  contained\nin the alleged dying  declaration  is  true  and  whether  it  inspires  any\nconfidence.  Deceased Krishna Gir was seriously injured.   He  succumbed  to\nthose injuries in the Hissar hospital.  He must have  been  in  great  pain.\nIt is inconceivable that deceased  Krishna  Gir  would  make  such  a  dying\ndeclaration giving minute particulars like fathers name, caste  and  village\nof each  alleged conspirator when he was  on  death  bed  with  excruciating\npain. It would have been natural for him to just give the names.  But he  is\nstated to have given details of each of the  ten  alleged  conspirators  and\nthat makes this dying declaration suspect.  A bare  reading  of  this  dying\ndeclaration makes it evident that it is a doctored document.   Such  details\ncould not have been given by deceased Krishna Gir  at  that  stage.   It  is\npossible that they have been supplied by PW-3 Prithvi Gir.  The  High  Court\nin our   opinion has rightly observed that such  a  dying  declaration  does\nnot appear to be natural, but  portrays  an  attempt  by  the  successor  of\nBalakdera i.e. PW-3 Prithvi Gir to plant  names  of  all   those  with  whom\nBalakdera  had axe to grind through the  statement  attributed  to  deceased\nKrishna Gir.   We  find  it  difficult  to  place  reliance  on  this  dying\ndeclaration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">16.   It is well settled that an oral dying declaration can  form  basis  of\nconviction if the deponent is in a fit condition  to  make  the  declaration\nand if it is found to be truthful.  The courts as a matter of prudence  look\nfor corroboration to oral dying declaration. As we have already  noted,  the\ndying declaration of deceased Krishna Gir does not inspire confidence.   One\ncan perceive an effort to involve number of persons by giving  their  minute\nparticulars.  It does not appear to be a natural voluntary  statement  of  a\ndying man.  The prosecution could have infused some credibility in it if  it\nhad examined the driver of the car in which deceased Krishna Gir  was  taken\nto the hospital  and  Ramgiriji  who  was  also  in  the  car.   It  is  not\nunderstood why such  vital  evidence  is  kept  back.   Thus,  there  is  no\ncorroboration to  lend  assurance  to  the  dying  declaration  of  deceased\nKrishna Gir.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1836597\" id=\"span_2\">In this connection, we may usefully refer to <a href=\"/doc/1836597/\" id=\"a_30\">Heikrujam  Chaoba\nSingh vs. State of Manipur</a>[3] where the deceased was stated to have  made  a\ndying declaration to his brother in the ambulance.  There  were  four  other\npersons in the ambulance.  None of them was examined.   This  Court  refused\nto place reliance on the dying  declaration  as  the  disinterested  persons\nsitting in the van were not examined.  In the instant case, admittedly  PW-3\nPrithvi Gir was very close to deceased Krishna Gir.  He  was  the  successor\nof deceased Krishna Gir.  There was enmity between the accused and  deceased\nKrishna Gir’s followers.  The prosecution should have,  therefore,  examined\nthe driver or Ramgiriji who was in the car.  This is  an  additional  reason\nwhy alleged dying declaration of  deceased  Krishna  Gir  cannot  be  relied\nupon.  Besides PW-3 Prithvi Gir’s statement was recorded  three  days  after\nthe incident casting further doubt  on  the  dying  declaration.   We  shall\nadvert to that aspect now.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">17.   The dying declaration is allegedly made by deceased  Krishna  Gir  and\nnames of PW-4 Balbir Singh, PW-5 Pratap Singh, Hawa Singh and  Rajvir  Singh\nwere disclosed by PW-3 Prithvi Gir first  time  on  26/7/2000  at  Balakdera\nwhen his statement was recorded by the police.   PW-3 Prithvi Gir’s  silence\nfor three days creates a grave doubt about the truthfulness  of  prosecution\nstory.  He was the  principal disciple and  successor  of  deceased  Krishna\nGir.  If deceased Krishna Gir had made a dying declaration and  communicated\nthe names of the assailants to him, his devotion to  his  Guru  should  have\nprompted him to immediately disclose the names  of  the  assailants  to  the\npolice and others. His  silence  gives  scope  to  the  possibility  of  his\nconcocting a story involving number of persons from the  opposite  group  as\nthe perpetrators of crime.   As already  stated  by  us  in  this  statement\nrecorded three days after the incident PW-3 Prithvi Gir came out with  names\nof four  persons  as  eye-witnesses.   If  PW-3  Prithvi  Gir  had  so  much\ninformation, he should not have waited for three days to  disclose  it.   We\nshall soon go to the evidence of the eye-witnesses  named  by  PW-3  Prithvi\nGir.  But the fact that their names surfaced three days after  the  incident\ncreates a doubt as to whether they were  really  present  at  the  scene  of\noffence or whether this was a conscious decision  taken  within  three  days\nafter the incident to  create  evidence  by  citing  four  persons  as  eye-\nwitnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">18.   PW-4 Balbir Singh stated that on 23/7/2000 at about 8.00  a.m  in  the\nmorning, deceased Krishna Gir was sitting on a ‘Divan’  in  Satsang  Bhawan.\nSewanand was sitting on a mat  and  some  other  saints  were  also  sitting\nthere.   He stated that he and other saints were sitting under  a  Zal  tree\noutside the Satsang Bhawan where deceased Krishna Gir was sitting.   But  he\nalso added that they were sitting 10 to 12 feet away from  deceased  Krishna\nGir.  It is pertinent to note that his statement that he was sitting  10  to\n12 feet away from deceased Krishna Gir does not find place in his  statement\nrecorded under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 161</a> of the Cr.P.C. and, therefore, it is  clearly  an\nafterthought.  He and the other saints were, therefore,  sitting  under  the\nZal tree situated outside the Satsang Bhawan. Before we proceed further,  it\nis necessary to note that the High Court has observed that according to  the\nsite plan, the situation of two Zal trees standing in  the  Ashram  is  such\nthat from that place it is not possible to  see  what  is  happening  inside\nthe Satsangh Bhawan.  PW-23 Lakmaram Rathore also stated that  according  to\nthe site plan, it is not possible  to  see  what  is  happening  inside  the\nSatsangh Bhawan from the Zal  tree  standing  outside  the  Satsang  Bhawan.\nCounsel for the State tried to argue  that  what  is  happening  inside  the\nSatsang Bhawan is visible from  the  Zal  tree.   We  are  not  inclined  to\ndisturb this finding of fact recorded by the High Court which  we  are  sure\nhas been recorded after  carefully  perusing  the  evidence  on  record  and\nscrutinizing the site plan. If the witnesses  including  PW-4  Balbir  Singh\nwere sitting under a Zal tree from  where  what  was  happening  inside  the\nSatsang Bhawan was not visible, their  claim  that  they  saw  the  incident\nbecome suspect.  Even otherwise, the  tenor  of  their  evidence  and  their\nconduct make their evidence  suspect.  PW-4  Balbir  Singh  stated  that  at\naround 10.30 a.m two persons came through the crowd  near  deceased  Krishna\nGir. The man in front was  wearing pant and shirt and he fired  as  soon  as\nhe reached near the door of the Satsangh Bhawan.  He  fired  three  to  four\ntimes. Sewanand grabbed the person who had fired at  deceased  Krishna  Gir.\nThe man, who was  behind the man in pant  and  shirt  and  who  was  wearing\nkurta pyjama  fired  at Sewanand and Sewanand  fell  down.   The  assailants\nran towards the gate. They went out firing at a  wall.   He  further  stated\nthat he recognized them when they turned around. According to him,  the  man\nwho fired at deceased Krishna Gir was Vazir s/o Hoshiar Singh,  and the  man\nwho fired at Sewanand was Jora Giri s/o Duni  Gosain.   He  stated  that  he\nalong with Pratap Singh, Hawa Singh  and  Rajveer  followed  the  assailants\nafter the assailants had gone out of the gate.  He stated that at the  gate,\nBalraj s/o Krishan Chand was firing in the air with his  double-barrel  gun.\nAt some distance, Lachman s/o Jagannath was standing.  At some  distance,  a\ncar was parked.  Two persons were standing near the car, whom he  could  not\nidentify. Thus, according to PW-4  Balbir  Singh,  there  were  in  all  six\npersons whereas as per FIR Ex. P/1, only four persons were involved  in  the\nincident. It is pertinent to note that PW-4 Balbir Singh stated that all  of\nthem reached Hissar at about 4.30 to  5.00  p.m.   By  that  time,  deceased\nKrishna Gir had died and  after they reached  the  hospital,  Hissar  Police\ncame there.  But PW-4 Balbir Singh did not tell anything to the police.   He\nfurther stated that he had met Mangal Gir  immediately  after  the  incident\nand he had told Mangal Gir about the entire incident.   If Mangal   Gir  was\ncommunicated the names of the assailants Mangal Gir  should  have  disclosed\nthem to the police. Mangal Gir’s statement was recorded only  on  30/8/2000,\nin which, Mangal Gir did not disclose the names of  assailants.   Therefore,\nPW-4 Balbir Singh’s claim that he disclosed  the  names  to  Mangal  Gir  is\nsuspect. Moreover, Mangal Gir was  not  examined  by  the  prosecution.   He\nfurther stated that  when  he  went  inside  the  Satsangh  Bhawan  deceased\nKrishna Gir was talking. He had heard deceased Krishna Gir.  If that was  so\nhe should have  reported the incident to the police. He did not do  so.  His\nstatement came to be recorded after  three  days  on  26/7/2000  after  PW-3\nPrithvi Gir disclosed the dying declaration to the police and names  of  the\neye-witnesses.  The High Court has referred to  several  inconsistencies  in\nthe evidence of PW-4 Balbir Singh.  In  our  opinion,  the  High  Court  has\nrightly not placed reliance on  his  statement.   Evidence  of  PW-5  Pratap\nSingh also suffers from  the  same  infirmities.   His  statement  was  also\nrecorded three days after the incident. No reliance can  be  placed  on  his\nevidence.  The other two witnesses Rajveer Singh and Hawa Singh named by PW-\n3 Prithvi Gir  have  not  been  examined  by  the  prosecution.   Thus,  the\nevidence of so-called eye-witnesses does not inspire confidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">19.    We have already noted that PW-1 Puranmal who claimed  to  be  at  the\nscene of offence lodged FIR (Ex.P1).   He turned hostile.  It  is,  however,\npertinent to note that in the FIR, PW-1   Puranmal  involved  four  persons.\nHe did not name them but he stated that he could identify  them.   According\nto the FIR, deceased Krishna Gir and deceased Sewanand were sent in a  Ceilo\nCar to Pilani.  This version differs from the version of  PW-3  Prithvi  Gir\nbecause PW-3 Prithvi Gir states that they were taken in two different  cars.\n The FIR further states that on the way  Sewanand died and deceased  Krishna\nGir was taken to hospital at Hissar.  Thus, when  the  FIR  was  written  at\n12.30 P.M on 23/7/2000, information about Sewanand’s death and departure  of\ndeceased Krishna Gir to Hissar was conveyed at Rampura village. No names  of\npersons who accompanied the deceased to hospital were  stated  in  the  FIR.\nNames of Ummed Singh,  Jagdish  Prakash,  Baba  Samundra  Gir,  Veer  Singh,\nKrishna Singh and Manish Singh were mentioned as persons who  had  seen  the\nincident.  Out of them Veer Singh was examined  as  PW-9,  Ummed  Singh  was\nexamined as PW-10 and Jagdish Prakash was examined as PW-12.   Rest  of  the\npersons were not examined.  The persons named in the FIR did  not  know  the\nassailants.  They stated that they could identify  the  assailants  if  they\nare brought before them.  However, no identification parade was  held.    We\nshall advert to the absence of identification parade a little   later.  PW-9\nVeer Singh, PW-1 Ummed Singh and PW-12 Jagdish Prakash  turned  hostile  and\nhence their evidence is of no use to the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">20.   The High Court has rightly noted that when the FIR was lodged by  PW-1\nPuranmal at about 12.30 P.M, the fact that deceased  Sewanand  had  died  on\nthe way to Pilani and deceased Krishna Gir was taken to Hissar was known  at\nthe Ashram at Rampura village.  By the time, alleged dying  declaration  was\nalso made by deceased Krishna Gir.  Therefore, the names of  the  assailants\nalso should  have  reached  Rampura  village  along  with  information  that\ndeceased Krishna Gir was being taken to Hissar.   PW-3  Prithvi  Gir  should\nhave communicated the names  of  the  assailants.   However,  names  of  the\nassailants were not disclosed by anyone to the police.    PW-4 Balbir  Singh\nstated that Sewanand was taken to Pilani  by  Raghavanand.   When  he  along\nwith others reached Pilani, Raghavanand told him that Krishna Gir  has  been\ntaken to Hissar.  The  prosecution  should  have  examined  Raghavanand  who\ncould have said whether any information about  assailants  was  communicated\nto him.  The prosecution failed to examine Raghavanand.  All  this  casts  a\nshadow of doubt on PW-3 Prithvi Gir’s evidence  that  deceased  Krishna  Gir\nmade a dying declaration to him in which  he  disclosed  the  names  of  the\nassailants.  It may also be mentioned that PW-12 Jagdish Prakash who  turned\nhostile made a statement that Mangal  Gir  who  was  present  disclosed  the\nnames of the  assailants  to  him,  but  he  did  not  remember  the  names.\nPertinently Mangal Gir’s name is mentioned in the FIR hence he  was  present\nat the scene of offence. However, Mangal Gir’s  statement  was  recorded  by\nthe police as  late  as  on  30/8/2000  and  he  was  not  examined  by  the\nprosecution.  It bears repetition to state that in  his  statement  recorded\non 30/8/2000, Mangal Gir did not disclose names of the assailants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">21.   PW-3 Prithvi Gir stated that he disclosed the names of the  assailants\nto PW-31 Prem Singh  Huda  at  Hissar  where  PW-31  conducted  the  inquest\nproceedings.  However, the names  of  the  assailants  find  no  mention  in\ninquest report.  In fact, PW-31 Prem Singh Huda stated that he had  recorded\nthe statement of PW-3 Prithvi Gir, but PW-3 Prithvi Gir  had  not  disclosed\nto him the dying declaration or the names of the  assailants.   PW-29  Laxmi\nNarayan, the  Investigating  Officer  stated  that  he  went  to  Hissar  on\n23/7/2000 and met PW-31 Prem Singh Huda.  He got a lot of information  about\nthe incident from PW-31 Prem Singh Huda except the names of the  assailants.\n According to PW-29 Lakshmi Narayan, he went to Balakdera on 25/7/2000,  but\nnobody disclosed the names of the assailants to  him.    The  names  of  the\nalleged  assailants  surfaced  three  days  after  the  incident  when   the\nstatements of PW-3 Prithvi Gir, PW-4 Balbir  Singh  and  PW-5  Pratap  Singh\nwere recorded.  No acceptable explanation is given for  delay  in  recording\nthe statements. The reluctance of the  prosecution  witnesses  to  come  out\nwith the  truth  and  name  the  assailants,  the  delay  in  recording  the\nstatements  of  eye-witnesses  and  statement  of  PW-3  Prithvi  Gir,   the\nunnatural dying declaration giving  minute  diverse  particulars  about  the\nassailants reflect on the credibility of the prosecution case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">22.   Another significant aspect of this case is absence  of  identification\nparade. Persons who were named in the FIR and others, who had witnessed  the\nincident at different stages did  not  know  all  the  assailants  but  they\nclaimed that they  could  identify  the  assailants.   But  the  prosecution\nfailed  to  hold  test   identification   parade.    It   is   argued   that\nidentification  made  in  court  is  sufficient.  Reliance  is   placed   on\nMalkhansingh where this Court has held  that  substantive  evidence  is  the\nevidence  of  identification  in  court.   The  test  identification  parade\nprovides corroboration to the identification of  the  witness  in  court  if\nrequired and what weight must be attached to the evidence of  identification\nin court, is a matter for the court of fact to examine.   There  can  be  no\ndispute about this proposition.  But in Malkhansingh this Court was  dealing\nwith a  case  of  gang  rape.   This  Court  noted  that  courts  below  had\nconcurrently found the evidence of prosecutrix to  be  implicitly  reliable.\nThis Court noted  that  the  appellants  raped  the  prosecutrix  one  after\nanother.  She was threatened and intimidated.   All  this  must  have  taken\ntime.  This Court noted that  it  was  not  a  case  where  the  identifying\nwitness had only a fleeting glimpse of the appellants.  The prosecutrix  had\na reason to remember the faces of the appellants as  they  had  committed  a\nheinous offence and put her to shame.  She had abundant opportunity to  note\nthe appellants features and due to the traumatic  experience  the  faces  of\nthe appellants must have been imprinted in  her  memory  and  there  was  no\nchance of her making a mistake about their identity.   The  observations  of\nthis Court will have to be read against the backdrop of these  facts.  Facts\nof this case are different.  The incident does not seem to have  lasted  for\na long time.  The eye-witnesses were sitting outside the Satsang  hall.   It\ncannot be said that they had sufficient opportunity to see the faces of  the\naccused who were on the run.  In such a case failure to hold  identification\nparade is a serious drawback in the prosecution case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">23.   Having applied our mind to the evidence  on  record,  we  are  of  the\nopinion that the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond  reasonable\ndoubt.  We are mindful of the fact that this case involves two  murders  and\nuse of firearms. Crime is grave. But the  High  Court  has  scrutinized  the\nevidence correctly in light of settled legal principles.   The  evidence  on\nrecord creates some suspicion, but does not prove the offence to  the  hilt.\nThe accused are, therefore, entitled to benefit of doubt.   Besides,  as  we\nhave already noted the instant appeals challenge  the  order  of  acquittal.\nWe do not find the High Court’s judgment to be perverse.   The  High  Court,\nin our opinion, was justified in interfering  with  the  conviction  of  the\naccused.  The view taken by the High Court is  legally  unassailable  and  a\nfactually possible view. We, therefore, affirm it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">24.
