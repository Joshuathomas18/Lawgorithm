So far as lodging of Dehati Naleshi is\n                           concerned, a close scrutiny of the evidence available on record in\n                           this regard reveals that it appears to be an antedated document as\n                           according to the Dehati Naleshi, the date of incident is 02/11/2005\n                           at around 9:30 in the night whereas the Dehati Naleshi itself was\n                           lodged at 22:15 i.e. 10:15 pm. On the face of this document it\n                           appears to be suspicious so far as the timing is concerned for the\n                           reason that in a case where as many as 4 murder have taken place\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">Signed by: KHEMRAJ JOSHI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">Signing time: 29-09-2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">14:42:37</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                                                  19</span>\n\n                           and many persons have also been injured, it is, if not impossible but\n                           is very improbable that the FIR would be lodged within a span of\n                           45 minutes.

There is no\n                                 embargo on the appellate Court reviewing the evidence upon\n                                 which an order of acquittal is based. Generally, the order of\n                                 acquittal shall not be interfered with because the presumption of\n                                 innocence of the accused is further strengthened by acquittal.\n                                 The golden thread which runs through the web of administration\n                                 of justice in criminal cases is that if two views are possible on\n                                 the evidence adduced in the case, one pointing to the guilt of the\n                                 accused and the other to his innocence, the view which is\n                                 favourable to the accused should be adopted. The paramount\n                                 consideration of the Court is to ensure that miscarriage of justice\n                                 is prevented. A miscarriage of justice which may arise from\n                                 acquittal of the guilty is no less than from the conviction of an\n                                 innocent. In a case where admissible evidence is ignored, a duty\n                                 is cast upon the appellate Court to re-appreciate the evidence\n                                 where the accused has been acquitted, for the purpose of\n                                 ascertaining as to whether any of the accused really committed\n                                 any offence or not.
