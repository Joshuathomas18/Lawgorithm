The case of the prosecution in brief is that Atma Ram\n\nGupta (hereinafter ‘deceased’) who was a Councillor of the\n\nMunicipal   Corporation   of   Delhi   ( hereinafter   “MCD’)   went\n\nmissing                        on 24.08.2002. On that day, he left\n\nhis residence around 10.30 a.m. informing his wife Sumitra\n\nGupta (PW-18) that he would first be going to the house of\n\nanother Councillor of the MCD, Sharda Jain (A-1) and then be\n\nproceeding to attend a Congress Party rally at the Ferozshah\n\nKotla Grounds along with her. His driver, Prabhu Yadav (PW-17)\n\ndrove him to the residence of Sharda Jain and upon reaching\n\nthere, the deceased instructed the driver to take the car back\n\nto their residence. When the deceased did not return home\n\nuntil evening, enquiries were made by his wife and family\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                  2</span>\n\fmembers. A missing report was consequently lodged at 1 a.m.\n\non 25.08.2002. Ultimately, the body of the deceased was found\n\non 31.08.2002 in a sub-canal of the Bulandshar Rajwaha/Sanota\n\nCanal. A charge sheet came to be filed against nine accused,\n\nnamely, Sharda Jain (A-1), Raj Kumar (A-2), Pushpender (A-3),\n\nNirvikar (A-4), Rajender (A-5), Roshan Singh (A-6), Shri Pal\n\nSingh Raghav (A-7), Satender Kumar (A-8) and Rakesh Kumar\n\n(A-9). All the accused were tried before the Fast Track Court,\n\nRohini in S.C. No. 139 of 2006.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">3.   The Trial Court convicted Sharda Jain (A-1), Raj Kumar\n\n(A-2), Pushpender (A-3), Nirvikar (A-4), Rajender (A-5) and\n\nRoshan Singh (A-6) for the charges framed against them. As\n\nregards the other three accused Shri Pal Singh Raghav (A-7),\n\nSatender Kumar (A-8) and Rakesh Kumar (A-9), the Trial Court\n\nfound that they were not party to the conspiracy hatched by\n\nthe other convicted persons. However, they were convicted\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 201</a> IPC for causing disappearance of evidence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">4.   All the six accused (A-1 to A-6) filed criminal appeals\n\nbefore the High Court, namely, Criminal Appeal Nos. 19 of\n\n2007, 51        of 2007, 121 of 2007, 139 of 2007, 144 of 2007\n\nand 65 of 2007. After re-appreciating the entire material on\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                  3</span>\n\frecord, the High Court dismissed Criminal Appeal Nos. 51 of\n\n2007, 139 of 2007 and 144 of 2007 and allowed Criminal\n\nAppeal Nos. 19 of 2007, 121 of 2007 and 65 of 2007. In effect,\n\nthe conviction of Sharda Jain (A-1), Raj Kumar (A-2), Rajender\n\n(A-5) and Roshan Singh (A-6) was affirmed, while the other\n\naccused Pushpender (A-3), Nirvikar (A-4), Shri Pal Singh Raghav\n\n(A-7), Satender Kumar (A-8) and Rakesh Kumar                (A-9)\n\nwere acquitted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.   The convicted persons have approached this Court in the\n\ninstant appeals. Among them, Roshan Singh (A-6) who had filed\n\nAppeal No. 1888 of 2010 expired on 02.05.2017 and his appeal\n\nhas therefore been dismissed as abated. Accordingly, only the\n\nappeals filed by Sharda Jain (A-1), Raj Kumar (A-2) and\n\nRajender (A-5) were heard and have been decided by this\n\ncommon judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6.   It is the case of the prosecution that Sharda Jain (A-1) had\n\ndeveloped close relations with the deceased. When he began\n\nignoring her for another woman, she hatched a conspiracy with\n\nher brother, Raj Kumar (A-2) and two other persons, Rajender\n\n(A-5) and Roshan Singh (A-6) to murder him. Pursuant to this,\n\nthe deceased was taken to village Chajjupur in her car, where\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                4</span>\n\ftwo hired assassins, namely, Pushpender (A-3) and Nirvikar (A-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">4), shot him dead. It is alleged that the dead body was disposed\n\nof with the help of three police officers, namely, Shri Pal Singh\n\nRaghav (A-7), Satender Kumar (A-8), and Rakesh Kumar (A-9)\n\nwho threw it in a canal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">7.         There are no eye witnesses to the incident in question.\n\nThe case of the prosecution fully rests on circumstantial\n\nevidence, which has been used to weave a chain that points to\n\nthe guilt of each of the convicted persons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">7.1 With respect to Sharda Jain (A-1), the Trial Court and the\n\nHigh Court have considered the following circumstances:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     (a)       that she pointed out the place of the murder of the\n\n           deceased;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     (b)       that the deceased was last seen alive in her company\n\n           and that the time gap between the last seen and the time\n\n           of death of the deceased is so small that it makes the\n\n           possibility that the deceased could have come in the\n\n           contact of any other person too remote;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     (c)       no plausible explanation has been given by her as to\n\n           how and when the deceased parted company with her on\n\n           24.08.2002;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                    5</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">\f (d)          a false claim was made by her that she did not visit\n\n       Ghaziabad on 24.08.2002;</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n\n (e)        she misled the family members of the deceased\n\n       when    they   made    enquiries   from      her   about   the\n\n       whereabouts of the deceased;\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\"> (f) two meetings took place between Sharda Jain, Raj Kumar,\n\n       Rajender and Roshan Singh at the residence of Sharda\n\n       Jain, just a few days prior to 24.08.2002;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\"> (g)        her conduct of visiting the house of her driver, Om\n\n       Prakash in the late hours of the night on 24.08.2002 is\n\n       suspicious;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\"> (h) that she had motive to kill the deceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">7.2 As regards Raj Kumar (A-2), the brother of Sharda Jain, the\n\nlower Courts have considered the following circumstances:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"> (a) that he visited the house of Sharda Jain (A-1) on two\n\n       occasions along with two other persons just a few days\n\n       prior to 24.08.2002;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\"> (b) that he pointed out the place of the murder of the\n\n       deceased;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\"> (c) that his place of residence was in the vicinity of the place\n\n       of murder of the deceased;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                  6</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\f (d) that he did not controvert the fact of acquaintance with\n\n       other co-accused, Rajender (A-5) and Roshan Singh (A-6);\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">       and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\"> (e) that the wrist watch of the deceased was recovered at his\n\n       instance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">7.3 As regards Rajender (A-5), the Trial Court and the High\n\nCourt have considered the following circumstances:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\"> (a) that the deceased was last seen alive in his company and\n\n       that the time gap between the last seen and time of the\n\n       death of the deceased is so small that it makes the\n\n       possibility that the deceased could have come in the\n\n       contact of any other person too remote;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\"> (b)         no plausible explanation has been given by him as to\n\n       how and when he parted company with the deceased on\n\n       24.08.2002;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\"> (c)         that he has not controverted the fact that he used to\n\n       drive the car of Roshan Singh (A-6) on a temporary basis\n\n       and therefore, he was associated with Roshan Singh;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\"> (d) that he made a false claim about never having visited the\n\n       house of Sharda Jain (A-1);\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                  7</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">\f     (e)        that he refused to participate in the test identification\n\n           parade (TIP) and the reasons for such refusal are not\n\n           plausible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">8.         Upon considering the aforementioned circumstances and\n\nappreciating the material on record, the High Court found that\n\nthe chain of circumstances as against Sharda Jain (A-1), Raj\n\nKumar (A-2), and Rajender (A-5) was complete and it was\n\nproven that these persons had entered into a conspiracy to\n\nmurder the deceased. Accordingly, the conviction of these\n\npersons under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_7\">364</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 120-B</a>,\n\nIPC was affirmed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">9.         It is well-settled that in cases where the prosecution relies\n\non     circumstantial      evidence    to   establish   its   case,   such\n\ncircumstances should be duly proved and the chain of\n\ncircumstances so proved should be complete. This means that\n\nthe chain formed must unerringly point towards the guilt of the\n\naccused and not leave any missing links for the accused to\n\nescape from the clutches of law. Further, with respect to\n\nconspiracy, it is trite law that the existence of three elements\n\nmust be shown– a criminal object, a plan or a scheme\n\nembodying means to accomplish that object, and an agreement\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                      8</span>\n\for understanding between two or more people to cooperate for\n\nthe accomplishment of such object.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">10. In light of these observations, we shall proceed to examine\n\nthe cases of each of the three appellants, Sharda Jain (A-1), Raj\n\nKumar (A-2) and Rajender (A-5) in order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">\nSharda Jain (A-1)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">11. As mentioned supra, the lower Courts have considered\n\nvarious circumstances against Sharda Jain (A-1). While some\n\ncircumstances used by the Trial Court have been found to be\n\nproven by the High Court as well, some others have been ruled\n\nout. For the purpose of our consideration, given that the\n\nlearned Counsels for both sides have premised their arguments\n\non the circumstances finally used by the High Court to establish\n\nthe guilt of Sharda Jain, we will be adverting to each of those in\n\nturn.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">11.1    To prove the first circumstance of Sharda Jain pointing\n\nout the place of the murder of the deceased ( hereinafter ‘Spot\n\nA’), the prosecution has examined police officials, namely,\n\nInspector V.S. Meena (PW-62), HC Sunita (PW-31), SI Ram\n\nKumar (PW-32), SI Anil Kumar Chauhan (PW-44), and SI Shiv Raj\n\nSingh (PW-55). It also examined one Mahender Pal Gupta (PW-\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                9</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">\f8), but the High Court has entirely disbelieved his testimony\n\ndue to several discrepancies. We agree with the reasons\n\nassigned by the High Court for disbelieving the testimony of\n\nPW-8.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">     Apart from this, with respect to the evidence of the police\n\nofficials who accompanied Sharda Jain (A-1) to Spot A, i.e. PW-\n\n62, PW-31, PW-32, PW-44 and PW-55, we find that their\n\nevidence cannot be discarded. These prosecution witnesses\n\nhave withstood the test of cross-examination and clearly stated\n\nthat Spot A was not in the knowledge of the police up until\n\n28.08.2002, which is when Sharda Jain (A-1) took the police\n\nofficials to this spot. We do not find any valid ground to\n\ndisbelieve   their   testimony,    particularly   when   they   are\n\nindependent, unbiased police officials. There was no reason for\n\nthem to falsely depose against Sharda Jain, who was also a\n\npublic servant, being a Councillor of the MCD. Therefore, in our\n\nconsidered opinion, the circumstance of Sharda Jain pointing\n\nout the place of the murder of the deceased is proved.\n\n11.2 To establish the second circumstance that the deceased\n\nwas last seen alive in the company of Sharda Jain, the\n\nprosecution has examined Sumitra Gupta (PW-18), Prabhu\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                  10</span>\n\fYadav (PW-17), Om Prakash Chauhan (PW-11), and Manish\n\nKumar (PW-14).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">     In her testimony, PW-18 (wife of the deceased) has stated\n\nthat on the morning of 24.08.2002, when the deceased was\n\nleaving the house, he told her that he would be going to the\n\nresidence of Sharda Jain. Further, PW-17 (the driver of the\n\ndeceased) has deposed that he drove the deceased to the\n\nresidence of Sharda Jain at about 10.30 a.m. on 24.08.2002.\n\nLikewise, Om Prakash Chauhan (PW-11), who is the driver of\n\nSharda Jain, has stated that the deceased came to the house of\n\nSharda Jain in a car driven by PW-17 and thereafter sent the car\n\nback to his residence. He has also deposed that he was driving\n\nthe car of Sharda Jain in which the deceased and Sharda Jain\n\nwere sitting and they were heading towards the Ferozshah\n\nKotla Grounds, Delhi to attend a Congress party rally. Notably,\n\nnone of these statements have been controverted by the\n\ndefence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">     In addition to this, Manish Kumar (PW-14) has stated that,\n\nas a matter of chance, he saw the deceased at this rally,\n\naround 12 noon. Thereafter, he saw him leave in a car where\n\nSharda Jain was also seated. It is well-established that the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                               11</span>\n\ftestimony of a chance witness, though not necessarily false, is\n\nproverbially unsafe to rely upon. It is for this reason that the\n\nHigh Court chose not to rely on the evidence of PW-14 with\n\nrespect to the circumstance of last seen of the deceased.\n\nHowever, it was found that the evidence of the other witnesses,\n\nviz. Sumitra Gupta (PW-18), Prabhu Yadav (PW-17), and Om\n\nPrakash Chauhan           (PW-11) conclusively proved that the\n\ndeceased went to the house of Sharda Jain, sent his car back to\n\nhis house, and then went with Sharda Jain and attended the\n\nrally in the afternoon of 24.08.2002.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">     During her examination under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 313</a> of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure (hereinafter ‘<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_10\">Cr.P.C</a>.’), Sharda Jain (A-1) has\n\nadmitted that the deceased was present with her till the\n\nafternoon of 24.08.2002. The law on the point is very clear. A\n\nstatement made by an accused under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 313</a>, Cr.P.C. can\n\nbe used as an aid to lend credence to the evidence led by the\n\nprosecution. Therefore, in light of the testimonies of PW-18,\n\nPW-17, and PW-11, as well as the statement of Sharda Jain, we\n\nfind that the prosecution has proved that the deceased was\n\npresent with Sharda Jain (A-1) in the afternoon of 24.08.2002\n\nand was not seen alive by anyone after such time.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                               12</span>\n\f     Having observed so, it is crucial to note that the\n\nreasonableness of the explanation offered by the accused as to\n\nhow and when he/she parted company with the deceased has a\n\nbearing on the effect of the last seen in a case. <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 106</a> of\n\nthe Indian Evidence Act, 1872 provides that the burden of proof\n\nfor any fact that is especially within the knowledge of a person\n\nlies upon such person. Thus, if a person is last seen with the\n\ndeceased, he must offer an explanation as to how and when he\n\nparted company with the deceased. In other words, he must\n\nfurnish an explanation that appears to the Court to be probable\n\nand satisfactory, and if he fails to offer such an explanation on\n\nthe basis of facts within his special knowledge, the burden cast\n\nupon him under <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 106</a> is not discharged. Particularly in\n\ncases resting on circumstantial evidence, if the accused fails to\n\noffer a reasonable explanation in discharge of the burden\n\nplaced on him, such failure by itself can provide an additional\n\nlink in the chain of circumstances proved against him. This,\n\nhowever, does not mean that <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 106</a> shifts the burden of\n\nproof of a criminal trial on the accused. Such burden always\n\nrests on the prosecution. <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 106</a> only lays down the rule\n\nthat when the accused does not throw any light upon facts\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                               13</span>\n\fwhich are specially within his/her knowledge and which cannot\n\nsupport    any   theory   or   hypothesis   compatible   with   his\n\ninnocence, the Court can consider his failure to adduce an\n\nexplanation as an additional link which completes the chain of\n\nincriminating circumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">     Notably, a circumstance of last seen does not, by itself,\n\nnecessarily lead to an inference that the accused committed\n\nthe crime. There must be something more that establishes a\n\nconnection between the accused and the crime. For instance,\n\nthere may be cases where close proximity between the event\n\nof last seen and the factum of death may persuade a rational\n\nmind to reach the irresistible conclusion that the last seen of\n\nthe deceased is material and merits an explanation from the\n\naccused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">     In the instance case, there is proximity between the time\n\nof last seen of the deceased with Sharda Jain and the time of\n\nhis death. As mentioned supra, it is proved that the deceased\n\nwas last seen with Sharda Jain on 24.08.2002. It has also been\n\nshown that the deceased expired on 24.08.2002, as indicated\n\nin the testimony of Dr. S.K. Aggarwal (PW-21) who conducted\n\nthe post-mortem examination of the deceased at 2.30 p.m. on\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                 14</span>\n\f31.08.2002. He has deposed that the probable date of death of\n\nthe deceased was about a week prior to the post-mortem\n\nexamination, i.e. on 24.08.2002. Thus, the proximity between\n\nthe time of last seen and the time of death of the deceased is\n\nestablished. This, in turn, connects the accused to the crime in\n\nquestion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">     Further, the records show that the place of murder of the\n\ndeceased was a secluded area. In such a scenario, given that\n\nthe deceased had last been seen with Sharda Jain, the\n\nexplanation given by her as to how she parted company with\n\nthe deceased becomes crucial. In her statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_16\">Section\n\n313</a>, Cr.P.C., she has stated that she parted company with the\n\ndeceased on the afternoon of 24.08.2002, when the deceased\n\ngot down from her car at the Inter State Bus Terminus (I.S.B.T.).\n\nThis explanation has been disbelieved by the lower Courts in\n\nlight of the conduct of Sharda Jain prior and subsequent to the\n\nincident in question – she did not depose about her movements\n\non 24.08.2002 after the deceased allegedly got down from her\n\ncar at I.S.B.T., and she also denied being in the vicinity of Spot\n\nA on 24.08.2002. Both these claims have been found to be\n\nfalse by the Trial Court and the High Court and thereby\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                15</span>\n\fundermine the explanation offered by her on how she parted\n\nwith the deceased. We find that the explanation given by\n\nSharda Jain is also falsified by the evidence of her driver, Om\n\nPrakash Chauhan (PW-11). PW-11 has emphatically deposed\n\nthat he got down from the car at I.S.B.T. and the deceased\n\nproceeded on the onward journey to Ghaziabad along with\n\nSharda Jain and Rajender (A-5), who were also seated in the\n\ncar. There is no reason for PW-11 to depose against Sharda\n\nJain, especially since he was her driver. Thus, having regard to\n\nthe material on record, we find that the Courts below are\n\njustified in concluding that the deceased was last seen in the\n\ncompany of Sharda Jain and that the time gap between the last\n\nseen and the time of the death of the deceased is so small so\n\nas to make it impossible for the deceased to come in the\n\ncontact of any other person. Further, since no plausible\n\nexplanation has been given by Sharda Jain as to how and when\n\nshe parted company with the deceased                         on\n\n24.08.2002, this forms a link in the chain of incriminating\n\ncircumstances against her.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">11.3   We now turn to the third circumstance that a false claim\n\nwas made by Sharda Jain that she did not visit Ghaziabad\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                               16</span>\n\fon 24.08.2002. In this regard, the testimony of Om Prakash\n\nChauhan (PW-11) is again relevant. He has deposed that\n\non 24.08.2002, when the deceased and Sharda Jain returned\n\nfrom the rally, Sharda Jain had instructed him to go towards\n\nGhaziabad. As mentioned supra, PW-11 is a reliable witness\n\nwho has withstood the test of cross-examination. Thus, his\n\ntestimony establishes that the car of Sharda Jain was to be\n\ndriven to Ghaziabad on 24.08.2002. In addition to this, it is\n\nrelevant that mud having similar characteristics as soil found at\n\nSpot A was found stuck on the car of Sharda Jain. In her\n\nstatement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 313</a>, Cr.P.C., she has not given any\n\nexplanation as to why such mud was there on her car or as to\n\nher whereabouts after the rally on 24.08.2002. Given that she\n\nwas uniquely placed to explain these facts, we agree with the\n\nHigh Court that an inference can be drawn that Sharda Jain was\n\npresent at or around Ghaziabad             on 24.08.2002 which\n\nis close to the place where the incident in question has\n\noccurred.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"25220929\" id=\"span_21\">This is also supported by the mobile records of Sharda\n\nJain, which show that she visited Ghaziabad on 24.08.2002.\n\nThough the High Court has held that these records have not\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                               17</span>\n\fbeen proved, as no certificate was issued in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_18\">Section\n\n65-B(4)</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, we find that these\n\nrecords can be relied upon. This is because an objection\n\nrelating to the non-production of              a certificate under\n\nSection 65-B(4) relates to the mode and method of proof and\n\ncannot be raised at the appellate stage as has been held by\n\nthis Court     in <a href=\"/doc/25220929/\" id=\"a_19\">Sonu v. State of Haryana</a>, (2017) 8\n\nSCC 570. In that case, an objection regarding the mode/method\n\nof proof of call detail records (CDRs) of mobile phones\n\nrecovered from the accused was raised for the first time before\n\nthe Supreme Court. Drawing a distinction between objections\n\nrelating to admissibility or relevance of facts and objections as\n\nto the mode or method of proof of facts, the Court observed as\n\nfollows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">     “32. It is nobody&#x27;s case that CDRs which are a form\n     of electronic record are not inherently admissible in\n     evidence. The objection is that they were marked\n     before the trial court without a certificate as required\n     by Section 65-B(4). It is clear from the judgments\n     referred to supra that an objection relating to the\n     mode or method of proof has to be raised at the\n     time of marking of the document as an exhibit and\n     not later. The crucial test, as affirmed by this Court,\n     is whether the defect could have been cured at the\n     stage of marking the document. Applying this test to\n     the present case, if an objection was taken to the\n     CDRs being marked without a certificate, the Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                18</span>\n\f     could have given the prosecution an opportunity to\n     rectify the deficiency. It is also clear from the above\n     judgments that objections regarding admissibility of\n     documents which are per se inadmissible can be\n     taken even at the appellate stage. Admissibility of a\n     document which is inherently inadmissible is an\n     issue which can be taken up at the appellate stage\n     because it is a fundamental issue. The mode or\n     method of proof is procedural and objections, if not\n     taken at the trial, cannot be permitted at the\n     appellate stage. If the objections to the mode of\n     proof are permitted to be taken at the appellate\n     stage by a party, the other side does not have an\n     opportunity of rectifying the deficiencies. The\n     learned Senior Counsel for the State referred to\n     statements under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 161</a> CrPC, 1973 as an\n     example of documents falling under the said\n     category of inherently inadmissible evidence. CDRs\n     do not fall in the said category of documents. We are\n     satisfied that an objection that CDRs are unreliable\n     due to violation of the procedure prescribed in\n     Section 65-B(4) cannot be permitted to be raised at\n     this stage as the objection relates to the mode or\n     method of proof.”\n                                         (emphasis supplied)\n\n     Applying this to the instant case, we find that the\n\nobjection as to the reliability of the call records of Sharda Jain\n\non account of non-compliance with the procedure under\n\nSection 65-B(4) was raised for the first time before the High\n\nCourt. Since no such objection was raised at the time of\n\nmarking of these records before the Trial Court, we find that\n\nthese records can be considered.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                19</span>\n\f       A perusal of these call records shows that Sharda Jain had\n\nvisited Ghaziabad on 24.08.2002. Thus, in light of this, and the\n\nother circumstances discussed above, we find that it is proved\n\nthat Sharda Jain made a false claim in her examination under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_21\">Section    313</a>,   Cr.P.C.   that   she   did   not   visit   Ghaziabad\n\non 24.08.2002.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">11.4       The    fourth circumstance relates to Sharda Jain\n\nmisleading the family members of the deceased about his\n\nwhereabouts. In this regard, Sumitra Gupta (PW-18) and\n\nRajender Pal Gupta (PW-9; younger brother of the deceased),\n\nhave deposed that Sharda Jain gave misleading and false\n\nanswers to them when they made enquiries from her about the\n\nwhereabouts of the deceased. In our considered opinion, the\n\nHigh Court has correctly relied upon the evidence of these\n\nwitnesses to conclude that Sharda Jain had given a false\n\nexplanation to the family members of the deceased about his\n\nwhereabouts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">11.5    The fifth circumstance against Sharda Jain concerns her\n\nconduct of visiting the house of her driver (PW-11) in the late\n\nhours of night of 24.08.2002. Om Prakash Chauhan (PW-11) has\n\ndeposed that Sharda Jain had sent a fat man to his residence in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                   20</span>\n\fthe late hours of 24.08.2002 and the said person had told him\n\nthat Sharda Jain is calling him. This fact has not been\n\ncontroverted by the defence. Likewise, the evidence of his\n\nmother, Shanti (PW-10) that a boy came to her house and told\n\nher that Sharda Jain was calling Om Prakash has also not been\n\ncontroverted. Admittedly, there was some vagueness in the\n\nevidence of PW-10, but in our considered opinion, given that\n\nshe is a rustic woman, the High Court was justified in reading\n\nher evidence harmoniously with that of PW-11. Since the scene\n\nof murder in the present case is rural, the Court should judge\n\nthe matter after accounting for the rustic behavioral pattern of\n\nthe   witnesses   and   not   adopt   extremely    sophisticated\n\napproaches familiar in courts based on unreal assumptions\n\nabout human conduct. Keeping this in mind, it becomes clear\n\nthat when Shanti (PW-10) was told by the boy that Sharda Jain\n\nis calling her son, she perceived that Sharda Jain was present\n\noutside her house. It is on the basis of this perception that she\n\ndeposed that Sharda Jain had come to her house. However, a\n\ncombined reading of the testimonies of PW-11 and PW-10\n\nestablishes that Sharda Jain tried to contact her driver (PW-11)\n\non 24.08.2002. This conduct of attempting to establish contact\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                               21</span>\n\fwith her driver in the late hours of the day of the incident,\n\nraises a strong suspicion against Sharda Jain and indicates an\n\nattempt to request or pressurize PW-11 to not disclose the\n\nincident to any other person.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">11.6   Lastly, as regards the motive of Sharda Jain based on her\n\nclose relations with the deceased and her discontent with his\n\ngrowing relationship with another woman, (Memwati Berwala),\n\nwe agree with the High Court. The material on record is\n\ninsufficient to prove that the deceased had intimate relations\n\nwith Sharda Jain or Memwati Berwala. At best, the evidence on\n\nrecord indicates that the deceased and Sharda Jain were good\n\nfriends. Thus, the High Court has rightly concluded that the\n\nmotive, as put forth by the prosecution, is not proved.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">12. Be that as it may, the foregoing discussion on the other\n\ncircumstances against Sharda Jain clearly establishes that she\n\nwas last seen in the company of the deceased in the afternoon\n\nof 24.08.2002, which is the day on which he went missing and\n\nwas killed. Further, it is established that she was going with the\n\ndeceased to Ghaziabad on that day and was the first to point\n\nout the place of murder to the police. In addition to this, she\n\nhas made false claims as to the whereabouts of the deceased\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                22</span>\n\fas well as her actions post the afternoon of 24.08.2002. In light\n\nof all these circumstances, we find that the prosecution has\n\nsucceeded in making a case against her for the offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 302</a>, IPC. Further, given that the body of the deceased\n\nwas recovered from a sub-canal, and not from the place of\n\ncommission of murder, it is clear that the evidence of the\n\noffence was caused to be disappeared and the involvement of\n\nSharda Jain (A-1) was screened through false claims.       Thus,\n\ncharge under <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 201</a> of the IPC is also proved.\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">Raj Kumar (A-2)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">13. With respect to Raj Kumar (A-2), two circumstances merit\n\nour consideration – first, that he visited the house of Sharda\n\nJain along with two other persons on two occasions just a few\n\ndays prior            to 24.08.2002; and second, that the wrist\n\nwatch of the deceased was recovered by the police at his\n\ninstance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">13.1   With respect to the first circumstance, we agree with the\n\nHigh Court that there is nothing incriminating in this conduct of\n\nRaj Kumar (A-2). Being the brother of Sharda Jain, it is but\n\nnatural for him to visit her house frequently. Merely because he\n\nvisited her house on two occasions, just a few days before the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                               23</span>\n\fdate of incident, an inference cannot be drawn that these visits\n\nwere for conspiring to commit the murder of the deceased. In\n\nany case, it is not clear from the material on record as to who\n\nwere the other two persons who accompanied him to the house\n\nof Sharda Jain and how many days prior to date of the incident\n\nwere such visits made. Thus, in our considered opinion, this\n\ncircumstance has not been proven against Raj Kumar.\n\n13.2   The second circumstance is that the wrist watch of the\n\ndeceased was recovered at the instance of Raj Kumar. To prove\n\nthis circumstance, the prosecution examined police officials,\n\nnamely, Inspector V.S. Meena (PW-62), Anil Kumar Chauhan\n\n(PW-44), and SI Shiv Raj Singh (PW-55). These officials have\n\ndeposed that             on 28.08.2002, Raj Kumar got the wrist\n\nwatch of the deceased recovered from behind a speaker kept\n\nat a ventilator in the balcony of his house. It is further claimed\n\nby the prosecution that the watch so recovered was deposited\n\nin the malkhana on the same date,      i.e. 28.08.2002.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">       Before we discuss these claims, it is important to bear in\n\nmind that the instant case is not that of a robbery. Being an\n\naffluent businessman, Raj Kumar cannot be expected to have\n\ncommitted the theft of a wrist watch. Moreover, the wrist watch\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                24</span>\n\fseized from his house was identified by one Rajender Pal Gupta\n\n(PW-9), who resides about 10 km away from the residence of\n\nthe deceased. In his cross-examination, PW-9 has admitted that\n\nhe went to the spot of the murder on 31.08.2002 and that the\n\nwrist watch was still on the hand of the deceased at that time.\n\nHowever, as mentioned supra, Inspector V.S. Meena (PW-62)\n\nhas deposed that the wrist watch of the deceased was\n\ndeposited by him in the malkhana on 28.08.2002. This is\n\nsupported by the testimony of Dinesh Kumar (PW-43) who has\n\nalso deposed that the said wrist watch was deposited in the\n\nmalkhana on 28.08.2002 and that he had made an entry in the\n\nmalkhana register accordingly. Clearly, the testimony of the\n\npolice officials directly belies the evidence of PW-9. However,\n\ngiven that these officials are independent, unbiased witnesses\n\nand the fact that none of the close family members of the\n\ndeceased were called on to identify his wrist watch, we are\n\ninclined to believe the testimony of these officials. Thus, it\n\nappears that the prosecution has tried to improve its case by\n\nplanting the said wrist watch so as to falsely implicate Raj\n\nKumar in this case. In light of this, we find that the prosecution\n\nhas failed to prove the recovery of the wrist watch at the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                25</span>\n\finstance of Raj Kumar (A-2). Given that the High Court had\n\nsustained the conviction of A-2 primarily on the basis of this\n\nrecovery, we are of the opinion that he should given the benefit\n\nof doubt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">13.3 As regards other circumstances considered by the lower\n\nCourts against Raj Kumar (A-2), we find that there is no\n\nadequate material brought on record. As mentioned supra, the\n\nplace of the incident (Spot A) was first shown by Sharda Jain\n\nand not by A-2. Clearly, there cannot be a discovery of an\n\nalready discovered fact. Moreover, merely because A-2 knew\n\nthe other accused Rajender (A-5) and Roshan Singh (A-6), it\n\ncannot be said that he was complicit in the commission of a\n\ncrime with them. Something more such as a common criminal\n\nobject, or a plan or scheme to achieve it must be shown to\n\nprove the complicity of A-2. In our considered opinion, the\n\nentire evidence on record is insufficient to bring home the guilt\n\nof Raj Kumar (A-2). Accordingly, he deserves to be acquitted for\n\nthe charges framed against him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">\nRajender (A-5)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">14. With respect to Rajender (A-5), the major circumstances\n\nconsidered by the High Court are that the deceased was last\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                               26</span>\n\fseen alive in his company on 24.08.2002; that the time gap\n\nbetween the last seen and the time of the death of the\n\ndeceased is so small that it makes it impossible that the\n\ndeceased could have come in the contact of any other person;\n\nand that no plausible explanation has been given by Rajender\n\n(A-5) as to how and when he parted company with the\n\ndeceased on 24.08.2002.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">14.1 As regards the circumstance relating to the last seen of\n\nRajender (A-5), it is relevant to note that the driver of the\n\ndeceased (PW-17) has deposed that he drove the deceased to\n\nthe residence of Sharda Jain in the morning of 24.08.2002. This\n\nis corroborated by the testimony of Om Prakash Chauhan (PW-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">11) who has deposed that the deceased arrived at the\n\nresidence of Sharda Jain in the morning, sent back his car with\n\nPW-17, and then proceeded to the rally with Sharda Jain in a car\n\nthat he was driving. As mentioned supra, PW-11 has also\n\ndeposed that while coming back from the rally, Rajender (A-5),\n\nthe deceased and Sharda Jain were in the same car which was\n\nbeing driven by him towards Ghaziabad. It was during this\n\njourney that Sharda Jain instructed him to get down from the\n\ncar near I.S.B.T. and go back to his house. Accordingly, PW-11\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                               27</span>\n\fgot down from the car at I.S.B.T. and left the company of the\n\naccused and the deceased. From that point onwards, it is\n\nstated that Rajender (A-5) was driving the vehicle.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">       The testimony of Om Prakash Chauhan (PW-11) was\n\nvehemently challenged by the defence. During his cross-\n\nexamination, many suggestions were made to him, but they\n\nwere all turned down. In light of his reliable testimony, we do\n\nnot find any ground to disagree with the reasoning adopted by\n\nthe lower Courts to conclude that the last seen circumstance in\n\nrespect of Rajender (A-5) stands proved. Further, it is important\n\nto note that no explanation is forthcoming from Rajender (A-5)\n\nas to how and when he parted company with the deceased\n\nwhich thus becomes an additional link in the chain of\n\ncircumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">14.2    In addition to this Rajender (A-5) has admitted that he\n\nwas the driver of the car of Roshan Singh (A-6) on a temporary\n\nbasis. This establishes his association with another convicted\n\nperson in this case. Notably, this connection has not been\n\ncontroverted. Moreover, it has been found that the claim made\n\nby Rajinder Singh (A-5) that he has never visited the house of\n\nSharda Jain is false. This is clear in light of the reliable evidence\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                 28</span>\n\fof Om Prakash Chauhan (PW-11) who has stated that Rajender\n\n(A-5), Sharda Jain, and the deceased had left from the house of\n\nSharda Jain to proceed for the rally at the Ferozshah Kotla\n\nGrounds.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">14.3   Another circumstance against Raj Kumar relates to the\n\nplace of the murder of the deceased. It has been proved that\n\nSpot A is the place of the incident. On a close perusal, the\n\nevidence on record reveals that the car in which the deceased,\n\nSharda Jain, and Rajender (A-5) were seated went up to this\n\nspot on 24.08.2002. This is evident from the fact that the mud\n\nfound stuck to the tyres of the car of Sharda Jain had similar\n\nphysical characteristics as the soil found at spot A. Moreover,\n\nthe car of Sharda Jain was found by the police at her residence\n\non 27.08.2002. No explanation has been given by Rajender as\n\nto his movements on 24.08.2002 or any time thereafter. If it\n\nwere the case that the car of Sharda Jain, (which has been\n\nproved to be driven by Rajender), had not gone to Spot A, the\n\nmud of the scene of the offence would not have been found\n\nstuck to the tyre of the car. However, this is not the case. Thus,\n\nwe find that this circumstance indicates the involvement of\n\nRajender (A-5) in the commission of the crime.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                29</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">\f15. In light of the foregoing discussion, it is proved that\n\nRajender was driving the car in which the deceased was last\n\nseen with him and Sharda Jain (A-1). Further, it is also proven\n\nthat this car went up till Spot A, which is the place of the\n\nincident as is evident from the existence of the mud from the\n\nspot on the tyres of the car. In the absence of any plausible\n\nexplanation put forth by Rajender as to his actions on\n\n24.08.2002 and thereafter, and given the totality of material on\n\nrecord, we find that the circumstances considered against him\n\nestablish his complicity in committing the murder of the\n\ndeceased. The lower Courts, were therefore, justified in\n\nconvicting him under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 302</a> of the IPC. In addition to this,\n\ngiven the false claims made by him and the fact that the body\n\nof the deceased was recovered from a sub-canal where it had\n\nbeen thrown, charge under <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 201</a> of the IPC is also\n\nestablished against Rajender (A-5).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">16. However, as regards the charge of conspiracy, we do not\n\nfind that the conduct of Sharda Jain (A-1) and Rajender (A-5)\n\nconstitutes a criminal conspiracy to murder the deceased.\n\nStrangely, the High Court has observed that the prosecution\n\nhas proven that Sharda Jain was complicit in such a conspiracy.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                               30</span>\n\fHowever, on a closer reading of the impugned judgment, we\n\nfind that the High Court has not assigned any appropriate\n\nreasoning for arriving at this conclusion. Merely observing that\n\nit has been proven that A-1 and A-5 were complicit in a\n\nconspiracy to murder the deceased is insufficient to conclude\n\nthe existence of such a conspiracy. As mentioned supra, three\n\nessential elements must be shown – a criminal object, a plan or\n\nscheme embodying means to accomplish that object, and an\n\nagreement between two or more persons to cooperate for the\n\naccomplishment of such object. Admittedly, the incorporation\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1946503/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 10</a> to the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_27\">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a>, suggests that\n\nproof of a criminal conspiracy by direct evidence is not easy to\n\nget. While we acknowledge this constraint, we do not find any\n\ndiscussion by the High Court on what circumstances indicate\n\nthe existence of the essential elements of a criminal conspiracy\n\nin the instant case. On going through the entire material on\n\nrecord, we find that a criminal conspiracy has not been proved\n\nin the instant case. Thus, the charge against Sharda Jain (A-1)\n\nand Rajender (A-5) under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 120-B</a>, IPC for conspiring to\n\nmurder the deceased cannot be sustained. Be that as it may,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                               31</span>\n\fwe find that their acts have been done in pursuance of a\n\ncommon intention and attract <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 34</a> of the IPC.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">17. Having considered the entire evidence on record in proper\n\nperspective, we conclude that the prosecution has proved the\n\naforementioned circumstances against A-1 and A-5, which form\n\na complete chain pointing towards their guilt. In the absence of\n\nany missing links, they cannot be given a chance to escape\n\nfrom the clutches of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">18.
