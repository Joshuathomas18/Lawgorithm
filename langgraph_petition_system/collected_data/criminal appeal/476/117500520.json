The\n\ncountry made pistol was recovered from the spot which had been\n\nused at the time of commission of crime. As per the report of\n\nForensic Science Laboratory (Ex. PX), the fired bullet recovered\n\nfrom the body of deceased Joginder Kaur had been fired from the\n\ncountry made .315 bore pistol recovered from the spot. However,\n\nthere is nothing further on record to substantiate that the said\n\npistol had been used by appellant Sandeep.               The case of the\n\nprosecution was that the shot had been fired by appellant\n\nSandeep. However, no effort was made by the prosecution to get\n\nthe fingerprints on the pistol tallied with the fingerprints of\n\nappellant Sandeep.           PW-17, in whose presence the occurrence\n\nhad taken place, has failed to identify appellant Sandeep. The\n\ncomplainant has also stated that he could not apprehend the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> Crl.

PW-24 Constable Ramesh Kumar,\n\nwho had been deputed as Gunman of Joginder Kaur, had also\n\nnot witnessed the occurrence.                  As per this witness, he had\n\nfollowed the assailant who might have been 3-4 in number but\n\nhe could not identify them. PW-25 Constable Rajpal deposed that\n\nhe could not see anything after hearing the gun shot as there\n\nwas rush at the spot. He did not notice anybody fleeing after the\n\nincident. Thus, appellant Sandeep is liable to be acquitted for\n\nwant of his identification at the time of commission of crime.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">               So    far    as    appellant        Naveen   is   concerned,     the\n\nprosecution case is that he was standing at some distance from\n\nthe spot armed with a pistol and had accompanied his\n\nco-accused to the court premises. Thus, as per the prosecution\n\ncase itself Naveen had not fired at the deceased.                     Since the\n\nidentity of the person who had fired at Joginder Kaur has not\n\nbeen established during trial, the prosecution case against\n\nappellant Naveen is also rendered doubtful. As per PW-28\n\nDeputy Superintendent of Police Badan Singh (Inspector at the\n\nrelevant time), appellant Naveen had been produced before him\n\nby PW Ekram, Sarpanch of village Nawada. PW Ekram while\n\nappearing in the witness box as PW-13 has not supported the\n\nprosecution case. He has stated that he had neither produced\n\nNaveen before the police nor he ever confessed his guilt before\n\nhim.        Further        Ex.PO        is   the   memo     vide   which      letter\n\nEx. PFF, recovered from personal search of appellant Naveen was\n\ntaken in possession. However, a perusal of Ex.PO reveals that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> Crl. Appeal No. 576-DB of 2004 (O&amp;M),                                      - 11-</span>\nCrl.

In case appellant Naveen\n\nhad been produced by PW-13, the recovery memo Ex.PO should\n\nhave been attested by him.              The fact that one country made\n\npistol was recovered on the basis of disclosure statement\n\nsuffered      by    appellant       Naveen   also   fails   to   advance   the\n\nprosecution case as there is no expert opinion on record that the\n\nsaid pistol was, in fact, in a working order. Letter Ex. PEE dated\n\n25.12.2001 allegedly written by appellant Naveen Kumar to\n\nSurjit Singh recovered from the house of appellant Gurmeet was\n\ntaken in possession on 7.1.2002. Letter Ex. PFF dated 7.1.2002\n\nwas taken in possession at the time of arrest of appellant\n\nNaveen. The possibility that the said letters might have been got\n\nwritten from appellant Naveen when he was in police custody to\n\ninvolve him falsely in this case cannot be ruled out especially\n\nwhen the identity of the assailant who had fired at Joginder Kaur\n\nhas not been established in this case. A perusal of Ex. PEE\n\nreveals that the same was written by Naveen Kumar to Surjit\n\nSingh but it has been recovered from the possession of appellant\n\nGurmeet Singh.           It is also mentioned in the letter that Naveen\n\nKumar had been told by Gurmeet Singh that Surjit Singh and\n\nSandeep along with Gurmeet Singh had gone to Sheelu or Kuldip\n\nKalwa for receipt of money.             He (Naveen Kumar) and Sandeep\n\nhad committed the murder of Joginder Kaur at the instance of\n\nSurjit Singh. However, the letter Ex. PEE fails to advance the\n\nprosecution case as the identity of the main assailant who had\n\nfired at Joginder Kaur is not established in this case. Further\n\nthe letter is although alleged to have been written on 25.12.2001\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\"> Crl.

Appellants Surjit Singh and Gurmeet Singh are\n\nresidents of different villages. Hence, no reliance can be placed\n\non letters       Ex. PEE and Ex.

In\n\nhis cross examination, he deposed that he had not been\n\ninstructed by Inspector Badan Singh to verify qua the holders of\n\nthe said phone numbers from the company.        PW-28 Inspector\n\nBadan Singh had taken in possession mobile phone from\n\nGurmeet Singh at the time of his arrest bearing sim card\n\nNo. 98121-46589. The said witness further deposed that from\n\naccused Surjit on 22.1.2002 mobile phone with sim card was\n\ntaken in possession. The prints of the said mobile phone proved\n\non record by PW-8 fail to advance the prosecution case as no call\n\ndetails inter se the mobile phones recovered from appellants\n\nNaveen and Surjit at or around the time of occurrence have been\n\nproved on record.
