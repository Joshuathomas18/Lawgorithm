A complaint was  lodged  at  Navrangpura  Police  Station,  Ahmedabad,\nalleging the  kidnapping/abduction  of  a  six  year  old  girl  child  Gomi\ndaughter of Keshabhai Mathabhai Solanki and Laliben on 27.2.2003  at  around\n6:00 p.m. by the accused Kishanbhai son of Velabhai  Vanabhai  Marwadi.   It\nwas alleged, that the accused had enticed Gomi with a “gola”  (crushed  ice,\nwith sweet flavoured syrup), and thereupon had taken her  to  Jivi’s  field,\nwhere he raped her.  He had murdered her by inflicting injuries on her  head\nand other parts of the body with bricks. In order to  steal  the  “jhanjris”\n(anklets) worn by her, he had chopped off her feet just  above  her  ankles.\nThe aforesaid complaint was lodged, after the body of the deceased Gomi  was\nfound from Jivi’s field, at the instance of the accused Kishanbhai.  On  the\nreceipt of the above complaint, the first  information  report  came  to  be\nregistered at Navrangpur Police Station, Ahmedabad.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">2.  The prosecution version which emerged consequent upon the completion  of\nthe investigation  reveals,  that  the  family  of  the  deceased  Gomi  was\ndistantly related to the family of the accused Kishanbhai.  In  this  behalf\nit would be pertinent to mention that  Baghabhai  Naranbhai  Solanki  was  a\nresident of Gulbai Tekra, in the Navrangpura area of Ahmedabad.  He  resided\nthere, along with his  family.   For  his  livelihood,  Baghabhai  Naranbhai\nSolanki was running a shop in the name of Mahakali  Pan  Centre.   The  said\nshop was located near  his  residence.    Baghabhai  Naranbhai  Solanki  was\nrunning the business of selling “pan  and  bidi”  in  his  shop.   Naranbhai\nManabhai Solanki, father of Baghabhai Naranbhai Solanki used to live in  the\npeon’s quarters at Ambavadi in Ahmedabad.  Modabhai Manabhai Solanki,  uncle\nof Baghabhai Naranbhai Solanki, had expired.  His  son  Devabhai’s  daughter\nLaliben, was married to Keshabhai Mathabhai  Solanki.   Keshabhai  Mathabhai\nSolanki  and  Laliben  were  residing  at  Shabamukhiwas,  Gulbai  Tekra  in\nAhmedabad.  Keshabhai Mathabhai Solanki and  Laliben  had  two  children,  a\ndaughter Gomi aged six years, and a son Himat aged three  years.   Laliben’s\nsister-in-law (her husband’s, elder brother’s  wife)  Fuliben  Valabhai  was\nresiding near the residence of  Keshabhai  Mathabhai  Solanki  and  Laliben.\nKishanbhai the accused, is the brother of Fuliben,  and  was  residing  with\nher.  It is therefore, that the family of the deceased as also the  accused,\nbesides being distantly related, were acquainted with one  another  as  they\nwere residing close to one another.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.    Insofar as the occurrence is concerned, according to the  prosecution,\non 27.2.2003 Laliben, niece of Baghabhai, was confined to her residence,  as\nshe was expecting.  At about 6:00  p.m.  her  daughter  Gomi,  then  aged  6\nyears, had wandered out of her house.  The accused Kishanbhai then  aged  19\nyears, entice her by giving  her  a  “gola”.   Having  enticed  her  he  had\ncarried Gomi to Jivi’s field.  On the way to Jivi’s field, he stole a  knife\nwith an 8 inch blade from Dineshbhai  Karsanbhai  Thakore  PW6,  a  “dabeli”\n(bread/bun, with spiced  potato  filling)  seller.   Having  taken  Gomi  to\nJivi’s field he had raped her.  He had then killed her by  causing  injuries\non her head and other parts of the body with bricks.   In  order  to  remove\nthe “jhanjris” worn by her, he had amputated her legs with the knife  stolen\nby him, from just above her ankles.  He had then covered her body  with  his\nshirt, and had left Jivi’s field.  Kishanbhai the  accused,  then  took  the\nanklets stolen by him to  Mahavir  Jewellers,  a  shop  owned  by  Premchand\nShankerlal.  He pledged the  anklets  at  the  above  shop,  for  a  sum  of\nRs.1,000/-.  The accused Kishanbhai was confronted by Baghabhai  and  others\nconstituting the search party,  whilst  he  was  on  his  way  back  to  his\nresidence.  Kishanbhai, despite stating that he had not taken her away,  had\ninformed those searching for Gomi, that she could be at  Jivi’s  field.   On\nthe suggestion of Kishanbhai, the search party  had  gone  to  Jivi’s  farm,\nwhere they found the body of Gomi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.     Based  on  the  aforesaid  fact  situation,  confirmed  through   the\ninvestigation carried on by the Police, a charge-sheet  was  framed  against\nthe accused Kishanbhai under <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1684623/\" id=\"a_2\">369</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_3\">376</a>, <a href=\"/doc/764237/\" id=\"a_4\">394</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">302</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_6\">201</a>  of\nthe Indian Penal Code, and <a href=\"/doc/124700273/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 135(1)</a> of the  Bombay  Police  Act.   The\nabove charge-sheet was filed before the Metropolitan Magistrate,  Ahmedabad.\n Since the offences involved could be tried only by a Court of Session,  the\nMetropolitan Magistrate, committed the matter to the Court of  Session.   On\n8.3.2004, the Sessions Court to which the matter came to  be  assigned,  for\ntrial, framed charges.  Since the accused Kishanbhai denied his  involvement\nin the matter, the court permitted the prosecution to lead evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.  The prosecution examined 14 witnesses.  The  statement  of  the  accused\nKishanbhai was  thereafter  recorded  under  <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_8\">Section  313</a>  of  the  Code  of\nCriminal Procedure.  In his above statement, the accused  Kishanbhai  denied\nhis involvement.  Even though an opportunity was afforded to Kishanbhai,  he\ndid not lead any evidence in his  defence.   After  examining  the  evidence\nproduced by the  prosecution,  the  Trial  Court  vide  its  judgment  dated\n18.8.2004, arrived at  the  conclusion  that  prosecution  had  successfully\nproved its  case  beyond  reasonable  doubt.   By  a  separate  order  dated\n18.8.2004 the Trial Court sentenced Kishanbhai to death by hanging,  subject\nto confirmation of the said  sentence  by  the  High  Court  of  Gujarat  at\nAhmedabad (hereinafter referred to as the ‘High Court’)  under  <a href=\"/doc/1146308/\" id=\"a_9\">Section  366</a>\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">6.  In the above view of the matter, the proceedings conducted by the  Court\nof Session, were placed before the High Court at the behest of the State  of\nGujarat,  as  Confirmation  Case  No.  7  of  2004.   Independently  of  the\nconfirmation proceedings, the accused Kishanbhai, aggrieved by the  judgment\nand order of sentence dated 18.8.2004, in Sessions Case  No.  346  of  2003,\nfiled Criminal Appeal No. 1549 of 2004 before the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">7.    The criminal appeal filed by the accused Kishanbhai  was  accepted  by\nthe High Court.  Kishanbhai was acquitted  by  giving  him  the  benefit  of\ndoubt.  The Confirmation Case No. 7 of 2004 was turned down in view  of  the\njudgment of acquittal rendered by the High  Court  while  allowing  Criminal\nAppeal no. 1549 of 2004.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">8.  Dissatisfied with the order passed by  the  High  Court,  the  State  of\nGujarat approached this Court  by  filing  Petition  for  Special  Leave  to\nAppeal (Crl.) No. 599 of 2006.  On 11.9.2008 leave to  appeal  was  granted.\nThereupon, the matter came to be registered as Criminal Appeal No.  1485  of\n2008.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">9.    Before this Court, learned counsel for  the  appellant,  in  order  to\nsubstantiate the guilt of the accused-respondent Kishanbhai,  has  tried  to\nproject that the prosecution was successful  in  demonstrating  an  unbroken\nchain  of  circumstances,  clearly  establishing  the  culpability  of   the\naccused.  In fact, the endeavour at the hands of  the  learned  counsel  for\nthe  appellant  was  to  project  an  unbroken  chain  of  circumstances  to\nestablish the guilt of the accused.  Despite the  defects  in  investigation\nand the prosecution of the case, as also,  the  inconsistencies  highlighted\nby the High Court in the  evidence  produced  by  the  prosecution,  learned\ncounsel for the State expressed confidence, to establish the  guilt  of  the\naccused-respondent.  In this behalf, it is essential to record  the  various\nheads under which submissions were advanced at  the  hands  of  the  learned\ncounsel for the appellant-State.  We  shall,  therefore,  briefly  summarise\nall the contentions, and while doing so, refer to the  evidence  brought  to\nour notice by the learned counsel for the appellant, to establish the  guilt\nof the accused-respondent, Kishanbhai.  The submissions advanced  before  us\nare accordingly being recorded hereunder :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">(a)   First and foremost, learned counsel for the  appellant,  in  order  to\nconnect the accused with the crime under reference, extensively relied  upon\nthe  evidence  produced  by  the  prosecution  to  show  that  the  accused-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">respondent Kishanbhai was last seen with the victim.   He  was  seen  taking\naway the victim Gomi.  For the above, reliance was placed on  the  statement\nof Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5, who had deposed  that  he  had  seen  the\ndeceased Gomi with the accused-respondent Kishanbhai on 27.2.2003 at  around\n6:00 p.m.  As per his deposition, he had seen Gomi eating a  “gola”  outside\nhis (the witness’s) residence.  At the same juncture, he had also  seen  the\naccused-respondent  Kishanbhai  coming  from  the   side   of   Polytechnic.\nKishanbhai, according  to  the  deposition  of  PW5,  had  approached  Gomi.\nThereafter, as per the statement of PW5, the accused had carried  away  Gomi\ntowards the side of the Polytechnic.  In his testimony,  Naranbhai  Manabhai\nSolanki PW5, had also stated, that at about 9:00 pm, when he had again  seen\nthe accused-respondent Kishanbhai  coming  from  the  road  leading  to  the\nGulbai Tekra Police Chowki, he was asked, by those who  were  searching  for\nGomi,  about  her  whereabouts.   The  accused  was  also  asked  about  the\nwhereabouts of Gomi, by Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5 and by the son of  PW\n5 i.e., by Bababhai  Naranbhai  Solanki  PW2.   To  the  aforesaid  queries,\naccording  to  Naranbhai  Manabhai  Solanki  PW5,   the   accused-respondent\nKishanbhai had stated, that she  might  be  sitting  in  Jivi’s  field.   In\naddition to the testimony of Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5,  reference  was\nalso made to the testimony of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6.   PW6,  during\nhis deposition, had asserted, that  the  accused-respondent  Kishanbhai  had\ncome to his “lari” (handcart used by hawkers, to sell  their  products)  for\npurchasing a “dabeli”.  It was pointed out  by  Dinesh  Karshanbhai  Thakore\nPW6, that he had noticed the accused  carrying  a  child  aged  about  seven\nyears, wearing a red frock.  In his statement, he  also  affirmed  that  the\naccused-respondent Kishanbhai,  had  asked  him  for  a  knife  but  he  had\ndeclined  to  give  it  to  him.   Thereupon,  whilst  leaving  his  “lari”,\nKishanbhai had stolen a knife from his “lari”.  It  was  also  pointed  out,\nthat  the  knife  recovered  at  the  instance  of  the   accused-respondent\nKishanbhai, was identified by  him  as  the  one  stolen  from  his  “lari”.\nAccording to the learned counsel for the appellant, the last  seen  evidence\nreferred to above stands duly corroborated by  the  deposition  of  Bababhai\nNaranbhai Solanki PW2, not only in his deposition before  the  Trial  Court,\nbut also in the complaint filed by him at the first instance  at  Navrangpur\nPolice Station, Ahmedabad, immediately after the recovery of the  dead  body\nof Gomi from Jivi’s field.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">(b)   Learned counsel for the appellant also laid emphasis on  the  recovery\nof the weapon of offence, i.e., a blood stained knife, at  the  instance  of\nnone other than the accused-respondent  Kishanbhai  himself.   In  order  to\nsubstantiate the instant  aspect  of  the  matter,  learned  counsel  placed\nreliance on the testimony of Dinesh Karshanbhai  Thakore  PW6,  who  deposed\nthat the accused had visited his “lari” on the evening of 27.2.2003 for  the\npurchase of a “dabeli”.  The accused respondent, as noticed earlier, as  per\nthe statement of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6, was carrying a  small  girl\naged about 7 years.  He also deposed, that the accused-respondent had  asked\nhim for his knife, but upon his  refusal,  had  stolen  the  same  from  his\n“lari”.  Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6, had identified the knife which  had\nbeen recovered at the instance of the accused, as  the  one  stolen  by  the\naccused-respondent  Kishanbhai  from  his  “lari”.   Additionally   it   was\nsubmitted, that the accused had led the police to Jivi’s field,  from  where\nhe got recovered the murder weapon,  i.e.,  the  same  knife  which  he  had\nstolen from the “lari” of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6.  The  above  knife\nhad a blade measuring  eight  inches,  including  a  steel  handle  of  four\ninches.  At the time of recovery of  the  knife,  the  same  had  stains  of\nblood.  The above knife was recovered by the  police  on  1.3.2003,  in  the\npresence of an independent witness, namely, Rameshbhai Lakhabhai Bhati  PW1,\nwho in his deposition clearly narrated,  that  the  knife  in  question  was\nrecovered from Jivi’s field, from under some stones at the instance  of  the\naccused-respondent Kishanbhai.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">(c)   Learned counsel for  the  appellant,  then  referred  to  the  medical\nevidence produced by the prosecution, so  as  to  contend  that  the  wounds\ninflicted on the person of Gomi, were with  the  murder  weapon,  i.e.,  the\nknife recovered at the instance of the accused-respondent  Kishanbhai.   For\nthis, learned counsel  placed  reliance  on  the  statement  of  Dr.  Saumil\nPremchandbhai Merchant PW8, who had conducted  the  post-mortem  examination\nof the deceased Gomi on 28.2.2003.  In the post-mortem report, according  to\nlearned counsel, mention was  made  about  several  incised  injuries  which\ncould have been inflicted with the knife stolen  by  the  accused-respondent\nKishanbhai.  In this respect, reference was made  to  serial  No.14  of  the\npost-mortem notes (Exhibit 29) proved by Dr. Saumil  Premchandbhai  Merchant\nPW8, clearly indicating, that the injuries caused to the victim  which  have\nbeen referred to at serial No.7, could  have  been  caused  with  the  knife\n(muddamal Article No.19), i.e., the same knife, which had been recovered  at\nthe instance of the accused.  Even in the inquest  panchnama  (Exhibit  14),\nit was recorded that both legs of the victim Gomi  were  mutated  from  just\nabove the ankle with a  sharp  weapon,  with  the  object  of  removing  the\nanklets in the feet of the victim Gomi.  This  document,  according  to  the\nlearned counsel, also indicates the use of a knife in the  occurrence  under\nreference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">(d)   It was also the submission of the learned counsel for  the  appellant,\nthat at the time of recovery of the body of the victim  from  Jivi’s  field,\nthe same was found to  be  covered  with  a  shirt  with  stripes.   It  was\nsubmitted, that the aforesaid shirt was identified as the shirt worn by  the\naccused-respondent Kishanbhai, when he was seen  carrying  away  the  victim\nGomi, on 27.2.2003.  In this behalf, reliance  was  placed  by  the  learned\ncounsel for the appellant, on the testimony of  Naranbhai  Manabhai  Solanki\nPW5.  The above witnesses had identified the shirt as  a  white  shirt  with\nlines.  To give credence to the  testimony  of  Naranbhai  Manabhai  Solanki\nPW5, learned counsel also pointed out,  that  when  the  accused  was  found\ncoming from the direction of the police station after the commission of  the\ncrime, he was seen wearing a black  T-shirt.   The  statement  of  Naranbhai\nManabhai Solanki PW5, was sought to be corroborated with  the  statement  of\nDinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6.  The accused respondent is  stated  to  have\napproached the “lari” of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore  PW6  for  purchasing  a\n“dabeli”, and at that juncture, the accused-respondent  is  stated  to  have\nbeen wearing a white lined shirt, and a green trouser.  On the  recovery  of\nthe shirt and trouser, they were  marked  as  Mudammal  <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_10\">Articles  8</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_11\">14</a>\nrespectively.  Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6 had identified the  shirt,  as\nalso, the trouser during the course  of  his  deposition  before  the  Trial\nCourt.   The  green  trouser  worn  by  the  accused-respondent   was   also\nidentified  by  Bababhai  Naranbhai  Solanki  PW2.   Additionally,  Bababhai\nNaranbhai Solanki PW2 deposed that a black colour T-shirt was  worn  by  the\naccused-respondent when  he  was  apprehended  and  brought  to  the  police\nstation.  The above articles were also identified by Angha Lalabhai  Marwadi\nPW12 and Naranbhai Lalbhai Desai PW13 who were the panch  witnesses  at  the\ntime of seizure of the abovementioned clothing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">(e)   It was also the submission of the learned counsel for  the  appellant,\nthat the report  of  the  forensic  science  laboratory  was  sufficient  to\nconfirm, that the accused respondent was the one who  was  involved  in  the\ncommission of the crime under reference.  In this  behalf,  it  was  pointed\nout that the victim Gomi was shown to have blood  group  “B+ve”.   According\nto the report of the Forensic Science Laboratory, the bricks recovered  from\nthe place of occurrence (which had been used  in  causing  injuries  on  the\nhead and other body parts of the victim), the panties worn by  the  deceased\nvictim Gomi, the white shirt which was found on the body of  the  victim  at\nthe time of its recovery from  Jivi’s  field,  the  T-shirt  and  the  green\ntrouser worn by the accused  respondent  Kishanbhai  (at  the  time  he  was\napprehended), and even the weapon of the crime, namely, the knife  recovered\nat the instance  of  the  accused-respondent,  were  all  found  with  blood\nstains.  The forensic report reveals that the blood stains on all the  above\narticles were of blood group “B+ve”.  It was, therefore, the  submission  of\nthe learned counsel for  the  appellant,  that  the  accused-respondent  was\nunmistakably shown to be connected with the crime under reference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">(f)   In  order  to  substantiate  the  motive  of  the  accused-respondent,\nlearned  counsel  for  the  appellant  relied  upon  the  statement  of  the\ninvestigating officer Ranchhodji Bhojrajji Chauhan PW14, who had  stated  in\nhis  deposition  that  the  owner  of  Mahavir  Jewellers,  i.e.,  Premchand\nShankarlal  Mehta  had  presented  himself  at  the  police  station.    The\nabovementioned jeweler is stated to  have  informed  the  police,  that  the\naccused respondent Kishanbhai  had  pawned  the  anklets  belonging  to  the\nvictim  Gomi  with  him  for  a  sum  of   Rs.1,000/-.    Insofar   as   the\nidentification of the anklets  is  concerned,  reference  was  made  to  the\nstatement of Keshobhai Madanbhai Solanki PW7, i.e.,  father  of  the  victim\nwho had  identified  the  anklets  marked  as  Muddamal  Article  No.18,  as\nbelonging to his daughter Gomi, which she was  wearing  when  she  had  gone\nmissing.  Reference was also made to the statement of Jagdishbhai  Bhagabhai\nMarwadi PW11, as also, the panchnama  of  recovery  of  the  silver  anklets\nwhich also, according to  learned  counsel,  connects  the  accused  to  the\ncrime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">(g)   Last but not the least, learned  counsel  for  the  appellant  invited\nthis Court’s attention to  the  statement  tendered  by  the  accused  under\n<a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.  During  the  course  of  his\nabove testimony, he  was  confronted  with  the  evidence  of  the  relevant\nwitnesses depicting, that the victim Gomi was last seen in  his  company  at\n6:00 p.m. on 27.2.2003.  He was also  confronted  with  the  fact,  that  he\nhimself had informed the search party, that Gomi  may  be  found  at  Jivi’s\nfield.  It is submitted, that the  accused-respondent  Kishanbhai,  who  had\nspecial knowledge about the  whereabouts  of  the  deceased,  was  bound  to\nexplain and prove when and where he had  parted  from  the  company  of  the\nvictim Gomi.  It was submitted that during  the  course  of  his  deposition\nunder <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, the accused  could  not\ntender any satisfactory explanation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">Based on the above evidence, it was the submission of  the  learned  counsel\nfor the appellant, that even in the absence of any eye witness account,  the\nprosecution should be held to  have  been  successful  in  establishing  the\nguilt of the accused-respondent Kishanbhai through circumstantial  evidence.\n The claim of circumstantial  evidence  emerging  from  different  witnesses\nsummarized above, according to the learned counsel, leads to  one  and  only\none conclusion, namely, that the  accused-respondent  Kishanbhai  alone  had\ncommitted the criminal acts under reference.  It  was  submitted,  that  the\nchain of circumstantial evidence, was sufficient  to  establish,  that  none\nother than the accused-respondent could have committed the alleged  criminal\nactions.   It  was  also  contended,  that  no  link   in   the   chain   of\ncircumstantial evidence was missing, so as to render any  ambiguity  in  the\nmatter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">10.  We have heard the learned counsels for the parties.  To  determine  the\ncontroversy arising out of the  instant  criminal  appeal,  we  shall  first\nendeavour to summarise  the  conclusions  drawn  by  the  High  Court  under\ndifferent  heads.   We  have  decided  to  adopt  the  above  procedure   to\nunderstand the implications of various aspects of the evidence  produced  by\nthe prosecution before the Trial Court.  This procedure has been adopted  by\nus (even though the same was neither adopted by the Trial Court, or  by  the\nHigh Court) so as to effectively understand, and  thereupon,  to  adequately\ndeal with the contentions advanced at the hands  of  the  appellant,  before\nthis Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">11.  We would first of all, like to deal with the lapses  committed  by  the\ninvestigating and prosecuting agencies in the process  of  establishing  the\nguilt of the accused before  the  Trial  Court.   It  will  be  relevant  to\nmention  that  all  these  lacunae/deficiencies,  during   the   course   of\ninvestigation and prosecution, were pointed out by the High  Court,  in  the\nimpugned judgment.  These constitute relevant aspects, which are  liable  to\nbe taken into consideration while examining the evidence relied upon by  the\nprosecution.  We have summarised the aforesaid lapses, pointedly  to  enable\nus to correctly deal with the submissions advanced  at  the  behest  of  the\nState.  Since the guilt of the accused in the instant case is  to  be  based\non circumstantial evidence, it is essential for us to determine  whether  or\nnot a complete chain of events stand established from the evidence  produced\nby the prosecution.  The  above  deficiencies  and  shortcomings  are  being\nsummarised below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(a)   According to the prosecution story after having  removed  the  anklets\nfrom Gomi’s feet, the accused Kishanbai had taken  the  anklets  to  Mahavir\nJewellers, a shop owned  by  Premchand  Shankerlal.   He  pledged  aforesaid\nanklets with Premchand Shankerlal, for a sum of Rs.  1,000/-.   The  anklets\nunder reference, were handed over by Premchand Shankerlal to  the  investing\nofficer on 1.3.2003, in the presence of two panch witnesses.   According  to\nthe prosecution case, the jeweller had gone to the police station  with  the\nanklets on his own, after having read newspaper reports to the effect,  that\na girl had been raped and murdered and her anklets had been taken away.   He\nhad approached the police station under  the  suspicion,  that  the  anklets\npledged with  him,  might  have  belonged  to  the  girl  mentioned  in  the\nnewspaper reports.  One of the panch witnesses, namely, Jagdishbhai  Marwari\nPW15 had  deposed,  that  above  Premchand  Shankerlal  had  identified  the\naccused Kishanbhai, as the very person who  had  pledged  the  anklets  with\nhim.  In this behalf it is relevant to mention,  that  Premchand  Shankerlal\nwas not produced as a prosecution witness.  It is important to notice,  that\nthe anklets handed over to the Police, were successfully established by  the\nprosecution as the ones worn  by  the  deceased  Gomi.   The  lapse  of  the\nprosecution on account of not producing Premchand Shankerlal as  prosecution\nwitness, according to the High Court, resulted in  a  missing  link  in  the\nchain of events which  would  have  established  the  link  of  the  accused\nKishanbhai, with the anklets, and thereby convulsively connecting  him  with\nthe crime.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(b)  The prosecution story further discloses, that Premchand Shankerlal  the\nowner of  Mahavir  Jewellers,  had  executed  a  receipt  with  the  accused\nKishanbhai, depicting the pledging of the anklets for a sum  of  Rs.1,000/-.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">The aforesaid receipt was placed on record of the  Trial  Court  as  exhibit\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">52.  The above receipt according to Premchand Shankerlal, was  thumb  marked\nby the accused Kishanbhai.  Even though the receipt indicates  the  name  of\nthe person who had pledged the anklets as Rajubhai, the same  could  clearly\nbe a false name given by the person who  pledged  the  anklets.   Certainly,\nthere could be no mistake in the identity of the thumb mark affixed  on  the\nsaid receipt.  The prosecution could have easily  established  the  identity\nof the pledger, by comparing the thumb impression on  the  receipt  (exhibit\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">52), with the thumb impression of the accused-respondent  Kishanbhai.   This\nwas however not done.   The  lapse  committed  by  the  prosecution  in  not\nproducing  Premchand  Shankerlal  as  a  witness,  could  have  easily  been\novercome by proving the identity of the person who had pledged the  anklets,\nby identifying  the  thumb  impression  on  the  receipt  (exhibit  52),  in\naccordance with law.  In case the thumb impression turned out to be that  of\nthe accused Kishanbhai, he would be unmistakably linked with the crime.   In\ncase it was found not to be the thumb impression of the accused  Kishanbhai,\nhis innocence could also have been inferred.  According to  the  High  Court\nthis important lapse in  proving  the  prosecution  case  before  the  Trial\nCourt, had resulted in a major obstacle in establishing the  guilt/innocence\nof the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">(c)  It is  also  the  case  of  the  prosecution,  that  when  the  accused\nKishanbhai was apprehended,  a  sum  of  Rs.940/-  was  recovered  from  his\npossession.  According to the prosecution story the accused  Kishanbhai  had\npledged the anklets at Mahavir Jewellers with  Premchand  Shankerlal  for  a\nsum of Rs.  1,000/-.   In  order  to  link  the  money  recovered  from  his\npossession at  the  time  of  his  detention,  it  was  imperative  for  the\nprosecution to establish how and why a sum of Rs.940/- only,  was  recovered\nfrom the possession of the accused Kishanbhai.  He ought  to  have  been  in\npossession of  at  least  Rs.1,000/-  i.e.,  the  amount  given  to  him  by\nPremchand Shankerlal  when he pledged the anklets at his shop,  even  if  it\nis assumed that he had no money with him when he  had  pawned  the  anklets.\nThis important link having not been established by the  prosecution,  breaks\nthe chain of  events  necessary  to  establish  the  guilt  of  the  accused\nKishanbhai, and constitutes a serious lapse in the prosecution evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">(d)  It is apparent from the prosecution story, that  the  victim  Gomi  was\nraped.  In establishing the factum of the rape the  prosecution  had  relied\nupon  the  note  prepared  at  the  time  of  conducting   the   post-mortem\nexamination of the deceased Gomi.  The same inter  alia  reveals,  that  dry\nblood was present over  the  labia,  and  deep  laceration  of  subcutaneous\ntissues was present on the left margin of the vaginal  opening,  just  above\nthe posterior commission.  The hymen was also found ruptured at 3  and  6,O’\nclock.  It is therefore, that the accused was deputed  for  being  subjected\nto medical examination, during the course of investigation.  For  the  above\npurpose he was examined by Dr. P.D. Shah.  In  fact  Dr.  P.D.  Shah  was  a\ncited witness before the Trial Court.  Despite the above Dr. P.D.  Shah  was\nnot examined as a prosecution witness.  Clearly a vital link in a  chain  of\nevents, to establish  the  rape  of  the  victim  Gomi  came  to  be  broken\nconsequent upon by the non-examination of Dr. P.D.  Shah  as  a  prosecution\nwitness.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">(e)  The High Court has  also  noticed,  that  even  the  report/certificate\ngiven by the medical officer relating to  the  medical  examination  of  the\naccused Kishanbhai was not produced by  the  prosecution  before  the  Trial\nCourt.  It is apparent, that the lapse in not producing Dr. P.D. Shah  as  a\nprosecution witness, may have been overcome if the report  prepared  by  him\n(after examining the accused Kishanbhai) was placed on  the  record  of  the\nTrial Court, after being proved in  accordance  with  law.   The  action  of\nprosecution in not producing the aforesaid report before  the  Trial  Court,\nwas another serious lapse in proving the case before the Trial Court.   This\nhad also resulted a missing vital link, in the chain of events  which  could\nhave established, whether or not accused Kishanbhai had  committed  rape  on\nvictim Gomi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">(f)  The High Court having noticed the injuries  suffered  by  Gomi,  a  six\nyear old girl child on her genitals, had expressed the view, that  the  same\nwould have resulted in reciprocal injuries to the male organ of  the  person\nwho had committed rape on her.  It was pointed  out,  that  if  the  accused\nKishanbhai had been sent  for  medical  examination  the  testimony  or  the\nreport of the medical officer would have revealed  the  presence  of  smegma\naround the corona-glandis, which would have either established innocence  or\nguilt of the accused, specially if the accused had been  medically  examined\nwithin 24 hours.  In the instant case the sequence  of  the  events  reveal,\nthat the occurrence had been committed between 6:00 p.m.  to  8:00  p.m.  on\n27.2.2003.  At the time of recovery  of  the  body  of  deceased  Gomi  from\nJivi’s field, at about 9:00 pm, it came to be believed  that  she  had  been\nsubjected to rape.  The accused Kishanbhai was shown to have  been  formerly\narrested at 6:40 a.m. on 28.2.2003 (even if the inference drawn by the  High\nCourt, that the accused Kishanbhai was in police custody since 9:00 p.m.  on\n27.2.2003 itself, is  ignored).   The  accused  could  have  been  medically\nexamined within a period of 24 hours of  the  occurrence.   The  prosecution\ncase does not show whether or not such action was taken.  This lapse in  the\ninvestigation of the case, had also resulted the omission of  a  vital  link\nin the chain of events  which  would  have  unquestionably  established  the\nguilt of the accused Kishanbhai of having committed rape  (or  possibly  his\ninnocence).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">(g)  It needs to be noticed, that when the accused Kishanbhai was  arrested,\nthere were several injuries on his person.   The  said  injuries  were  also\ndepicted in his arrest panchnama.  At 7:15  am  on  28.2.2003,  the  accused\nKishanbhai filed a first information report alleging, that he was beaten  by\nsome of the relatives of the victim Gomi, as also, by some  unknown  persons\naccompanying the search party,  under  the  suspicion/belief,  that  he  was\nresponsible for the occurrence.  In the above first information report,  the\naccused Kishanbhai had also depicted the  nature  of  injuries  suffered  by\nhim.   The  statement  of  the  investigating  officer  Ranchodji  Bhojrajji\nChauhan PW14 reveals, that the accused Kishanbhai had  been  sent  to  Civil\nHospital, Ahmedabad, for his medical examination.  Neither  the  doctor  who\nhad examined the accused was produced as  a  prosecution  witness,  nor  the\nreport/certificate given by the medical officer disclosing  the  details  of\nhis observations/findings was placed on record.   This  evidence  was  vital\nfor the success of the prosecution  case.   According  to  the  High  Court,\nblood of group “B +ve” was found on the clothes of the  accused  Kishanbhai.\nThe important question to be determined thereupon was, whether  it  was  his\nown blood or blood of  the  victim  Gomi.   The  statement  of  the  medical\nofficer who had examined  the  accused  Kishabhai,  when  he  was  sent  for\nmedical examination  to  Civil  Hospital,  Ahmedabad,  would  have  disclose\nwhether  or  not  accused  Kishanbhai  had  any  bleeding   injuries.    The\nimportance of nature of the injuries  suffered  by  the  accused  Kishanbhai\nemerges from the fact, that both the accused Kishanbhai and the victim  Gomi\nhad the same blood group        “B +ve”.  An inference could have only  been\ndrawn that the blood on his clothes was that of the victim, in case  it  was\nestablished that the accused-respondent  Kishanbhai  had  not  suffered  any\nbleeding injuries, and therefore, the possibility of his own blood being  on\nhis clothes was ruled out.  This important link in the chain  of  events  is\nalso missing from the evidence produced by the prosecution, and  constitutes\na serious lapse in the investigation/prosecution of the case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">In view of the above factual position, the High  Court  made  the  following\nobservations “Looking to the advancement in the field  of  medical  science,\nthe investigating agency should not have stopped at this stage.  Though  ABO\nsystem of blood grouping is one of  the  most  important  system,  which  is\nbeing normally used for distinguishing blood  of  different  persons,  there\nare about 19 genetically determined blood  grouping  systems  known  to  the\npresent day science,  and  it  is  also  known  that  there  are  about  200\ndifferent blood groups, which have been identified by the modern  scientific\nmethods  (Source:  Mc-Graw-Hill  Encyclopedia  of  Science  and  Technology,\nVol.2).  Had such an effort been made by the  prosecution,  the  outcome  of\nthe said effort would have helped a lot to the trial Court  in  ascertaining\nwhether the accused had in fact visited the scene of  offence.”   This  also\nconstitutes a  glaring  lapse  in  the  investigation  of  the  crime  under\nreference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">There has now been a great advancement in scientific  investigation  on  the\ninstant aspect of the  matter.   The  investigating  agency  ought  to  have\nsought DNA profiling of the blood samples, which would have  given  a  clear\npicture whether or not the blood of the victim Gomi  was,  in  fact  on  the\nclothes   of   the   accused-respondent   Kishanbhai.     This    scientific\ninvestigation would  have  unquestionably  determined  whether  or  not  the\naccused-respondent was linked with the crime.  Additionally,  DNA  profiling\nof the blood found on the knife used in the commission of the  crime  (which\nthe  accused-respondent,  Kishanbhai  had  allegedly  stolen   from   Dinesh\nKarshanbhai Thakore PW6), would have  uncontrovertibly  determined,  whether\nor not the said knife had been used for severing  the  legs  of  the  victim\nGomi, to remove her anklets.  In spite of so much advancement in  the  field\nof forensic science, the investigating agency seriously  erred  in  carrying\nout an effective investigation to genuinely  determine  the  culpability  of\nthe accused-respondent Kishanbhai.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">(h)  It is also apparent from the complaint submitted by Bababhai  Naranbhai\nSolanki PW 2, that he had been informed by one Kalabhai Ganeshbhai, that  he\nhad seen the accused Kishanbhai taking away Gomi.  In  such  an  event,  the\nproof of the fact of the accused-respondent having abducted Gomi could  have\nonly been substantiated, through the statement of  Kalabhai  Ganeshbhai  who\nhad  allegedly  actually  seen  the  accused  Kishanbhai  taking  her  away.\nAccording to the  High  Court,  for  the  reasons  best  known  to  it,  the\nprosecution did not produce Kalabhai Ganeshbhai as a witness.   Even  though\naccording to the High Court the above-mentioned Kalabhai  Ganeshbhai  was  a\nresident in one of the peon quarters, and was  also  a  government  servant,\nthe absence of the evidence of the above  factual  position,  results  in  a\ndeficiency  in  the  confirmation  of  a  factual  position  of  substantial\nimportance, from the chain of events necessary  for  establishing  the  last\nseen evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">(i)  It is also apparent, that there is no dispute about the recovery  of  a\ngreen blood stained “dupatta”, from the person of  the  victim.   The  green\nblood stained “dupatta” (veil)  was  found  by  the  medical  officer  while\nconducting the post-mortem examination on Gomi.  The existence of the  green\n“dupatta” was also duly mentioned in the post-mortem report.   According  to\nthe High Court, none of  the  prosecution  witnesses  had  referred  to  the\nfactum of the victim having  worn  a  green  “dupatta”.   According  to  the\nprosecution evidence, the deceased was wearing  a  red  frock  and  panties,\nwhereas, the accused was  wearing  a  full  sleeve  white  shirt  and  green\ntrousers.  According to the High  Court,  if  neither  the  victim  nor  the\naccused had a green “dupatta”, a question would arise, as to how  the  green\nblood stained “dupatta” was found on the dead  body  of  the  victim.   Even\nleading to the inference of the presence of a third party  at  the  time  of\noccurrence.  The above omission in not explaining the presence of the  green\n“dupatta”, has also been taken by the High Court, as a glaring  omission  at\nthe hands of the prosecution in the process of investigation/prosecution  of\nthe charges levelled against the accused Kishanbhai.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">(j)   While deposing before the  Trial  Court,  Dinesh  Karshanbhai  Thakore\nPW6, affirmed that the  accused-respondent  Kishanbhai  had  approached  his\n“lari” for the first time to purchase  a  “dabeli”  on  27.2.2003.   It  is,\ntherefore, apparent that Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6 had  not  known  the\naccused-respondent before 27.2.2003.  In the above view of  the  matter,  it\nwas imperative for the investigating agency to hold  a  test  identification\nparade in order to determine whether Dinesh  Karshanbhai  Thakore  PW6,  had\ncorrectly identified the accused-respondent, as the person who had  come  to\nhis “lari” to purchase a “dabeli” on 27.2.2003.  And  also  whether  he  was\nthe same person, who had stolen a knife from his “lari” on 27.2.2003.   This\nis also a serious deficiency in the investigation/prosecution of the case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">(k)   Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2, the complainant in the  present  case,\nduring the course of his examination-in-chief, observed as under :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">           “This incident was occurred on 27/2/2003, on  that  day  Lilaben\n           came to my house for pregnancy.  On the day of the  incident  at\n           6.00 o clock in the evening I came  to  know  that  Gomiben  the\n           daughter of Lilaben is not found.  Therefore, all our  relatives\n           have started searching her.   We  went  to  the  quarter  of  my\n           father, and inquired about the Gomiben, my father  told  that  I\n           saw Gomiben with Lalis Sister in law brother Kisan, he gave  ice\n           cream to Gomi.  Therefore, we have searched in the quarters  and\n           other places.  At around 8.00 o clock in the  night  kishan  was\n           coming from police Station, we have started asking him, at  that\n           time along with me Shri Jagabhai Molabhai,  Mohanbhai  Molabhai,\n           Hirabhai were present.  This police Chawky  means  Gulbai  Tekra\n           Police Chawky.  He told me that I  have  left  her  at  Jivivala\n           Field.  Therefore, we went at the Jivivala Field, at around 8.00\n           or 9.00 o clock, we went there and  we  found  Gomiben  in  dead\n           conditions, she had a several injuries on  her  head  and  other\n           parts of the body.  She was being raped.”\n\n\nFrom the above statement, it is apparent that Gomi  was  found  missing  for\nthe  first  time  at  6:00  pm.   The  search  for  her  began   immediately\nthereafter.  The search party met the accused-respondent  Kishanbhai  coming\nfrom the side of the police  station  at  8:00  p.m.   All  the  prosecution\nwitnesses have been equivocal about the  fact  that  Gomi  went  missing  at\nabout 6:00 p.m., i.e., the time when she was last seen  in  the  company  of\nthe accused-respondent Kishanbhai, and  thereafter,  the  search  party  met\nKishanbhai at 8:00 pm.   In  order  to  give  credence  to  the  prosecution\nversion, it was imperative  to  establish  that  it  was  possible  for  the\naccused-respondent Kishanbhai, after having taken  Gomi  at  6:00  p.m.,  to\nhave stopped at the “lari” of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore  PW6,  purchased  a\n“dabeli” from him. Thereupon, to have had  time  to  steal  his  knife,  the\naccused-respondent proceeded on with Gomi to Jivi’s field.  There  ought  to\nhave been enough time for him thereafter to have raped her,  then  assaulted\nher with bricks on her head and other parts  of  the  body  leading  to  her\ndeath, and finally to cut her legs just above  her  ankles,  to  remove  her\nanklets.  He should thereupon have also had time to hide the knife  used  in\nthe commission of the crime, under the stones. And thereafter further  time,\nto have taken the anklets to Mahavir Jewellers so as to pawn the  same  with\nPremchand Shankarlal Mehta, as also, time to  execute  a  receipt  in  token\nthereof.  Over and above the above, he ought have had  time,  to  visit  his\nresidence so as to able to wear a fresh shirt i.e., the shirt which  he  was\nwearing when he was detained.  After all that, he should have  had  time  to\ncover the area from Jivi’s field to Premchand Shankarlal  Mehta’s  shop  and\nfurther on from the above  shop  to  his  residence  and  finally  from  his\nresidence till the  place  where  he  was  detained.   It  is  difficult  to\nappreciate how all the activities depicted in the prosecution  story,  could\nhave been carried out from 6:00 p.m. on 27.2.2003 to 8:00 p.m. on  the  same\nday, i.e., all in all within a period of two hours.   It  is  in  the  above\ncontext that  the  cross-examination  of  Naranbhai  Manabhai  Solanki  PW5,\nassume significance.  Relevant extract from his cross-examination  is  being\nreproduced hereunder :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">           “It is true that the accused was coming from  police  Chawky  at\n           around 8.00 or 8.30 p.m. as I was not wearing the watch I cannot\n           say the exact time.  It is true that it takes 15 to  20  minutes\n           to go to Panjrapole from my quarters, and it will take 30 to  35\n           minutes to go to the field of JIVI.  It is  true  that  it  will\n           taken half an hour to come to the Office of BSNL through  Jivi’s\n           Field and C.N. Vidhayalaya.  It is  true  that  from  the  Jivis\n           field  towards  Panjrapole  and  through  Panjrapole  main  road\n           towards BSNL office, by walking it will take 40 minutes.  It  is\n           true that both the roads are public roads, and many  people  are\n           passing through this road.”\n                                                          (emphasis is ours)\n\n\nWhether or not the above sequence of events could have taken  place  in  the\ntime referred to above, would have been easily overcome if  the  prosecution\nhad placed on record a sketch map  providing  details  with  regard  to  the\ndistance between different places.  In that  event,  it  would  have  become\npossible to determine whether the activities at different places,  projected\nthrough the prosecution version of  the  incident  were  possible.   In  the\nabsence of any knowledge about the distance between  the  residence  of  the\nvictim Gomi as well as that of the accused  from  the  Polytechnic  or  from\nJivi’s field; it would  be  impossible  to  ascertain  the  questions  which\nemerge from the cross-examination of Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5.  Had  a\nsketch map been prepared or details with regard to the distance been  given,\nthe courts concerned would have been able to determine all that was  alleged\nin the  prosecution  version  of  the  incident.   This  deficiency  in  the\nprosecution evidence, must be  construed  as  a  serious  infirmity  in  the\nmatter.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">12.   We would now  like  to  deal  with  the  discrepancies  found  in  the\nevidence produced by the prosecution before the Trial Court.  We would  also\nsimultaneously summarise the effect of defences adopted  on  behalf  of  the\naccused-respondent Kishanbhai.  These aspects of the matter are  also  being\nsummerised hereunder, so as to  enable  us  to  effectively  deal  with  the\nsubmissions advanced at the behest of  the  State.   These  aspects  of  the\nmatter are liable to be taken into consideration, to  determine  whether  or\nnot, a complete chain of events stands proved to establish the guilt of  the\naccused-respondent.  The above considerations are summarized hereunder:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(a)   The post mortem report relied upon by the prosecution leaves  no  room\nfor any doubt that injuries on the genitals of  Gomi  were  post  mortem  in\nnature.   The  question  which  arises  for  consideration  is  whether  the\ninjuries under reference  had  been  inflicted  on  the  victim  first,  and\nthereupon, rape was committed on the victim.  It is natural to assume,  that\nthe first act of aggression by the  person  who  had  committed  assault  on\nGomi, was by inflicting injuries on her head and other parts  of  the  body,\nonly thereafter the legs just above the ankles, would have  been  cut  (with\nthe object of  removing  her  anklets).   It  is  not  possible  for  us  to\ncontemplate that the legs of the deceased were cut whilst  she  was  in  her\nsenses,  is  incomprehensible  and  therefore,  most  unlikely.   Now,   the\nquestion to be considered is, whether it was humanly possible for  even  the\nmost perverted person, to have committed rape  on  a  child,  who  had  been\nkilled by causing injuries on head and other parts of body,  and  after  her\nfeet had been severed from  her  legs.   We  would  have  no  hesitation  by\nresponding in the negative.  The prosecution in the instant case  apparently\nprojected a version including an act of rape, which is impossible to  accept\non the touchstone of logic and common sense.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(b)   The evidence produced by the  prosecution  also  reveals,  that  pubic\nhair  of  the  accused-respondent  Kishanbhai,  had  been  examined  by  the\nscientific  officer  of  the  Forensic  Science  Laboratory.    The   report\nsubmitted by the Forensic Science  Laboratory  (Exhibit  48)  reveals,  that\nthere was neither any semen nor any blood on the pubic hair of the  accused.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\"> Reference to the possibility of there being blood on  the  public  hair  of\nthe accused-respondent Kishanbhai emerges  from  the  fact,  that  the  post\nmortem report of the deceased revealed, that there was blood on  the  vagina\nof the deceased.  Whilst accusing the respondent-Kishanbhai of  the  offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 376</a> of the Indian  Penal  Code,  it  was  imperative  for  the\nprosecution to have kept in its mind the aforesaid aspects  of  the  matter.\nAbsence of semen or blood from the pubic  hair  of  the  accused-respondent,\nwould prima facie exculpate him from the offence of rape.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">(c)   According to the  testimony  of  the  complainant  Bababhai  Naranbhai\nSolanki PW2, the accused-respondent Kishanbhai was wearing a white shirt  at\nthe time of occurrence.  It is, therefore, when  a  white  shirt  was  found\ncovering the dead body of the victim Gomi, he had  identified  the  same  as\nthe shirt which the accused-respondent Kishanbhai was  wearing,  before  the\noffence was committed.  From the prosecution story, as it emerged  from  the\nstatements of different witnesses, it is apparent  that  Bababhai  Naranbhai\nSolanki PW2, had  had  no  occasion  to  have  seen  the  accused-respondent\nKishanbhai, wearing the said white shirt.  When Bababhai  Naranbhai  Solanki\nPW2, was questioned as to  how  he  knew  that  the  accused-respondent  was\nwearing a white shirt, when he first saw the shirt covering  the  dead  body\nof the victim, his response was, that he had been told  about  that  by  his\nfather Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5.  In the above  view  of  the  matter,\nthe question arises whether the testimony  of  Bababhai,  Naranbhai  Solanki\nPW2 about the shirt  referred  to  above  was  truthful.   And  whether  his\ntestimony can be described as fair and honest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_37\">(d)   Additionally when the accused–respondent Kishanbhai was arrested,  the\nT-shirt worn by him, was taken from him by recording a panchnama.  The  said\nT-shirt is available on the record of the Trial Court as Exhibit-39.  It  is\nnot a matter of dispute that the T-shirt (Exhibit 39), worn by the  accused-\nrespondent, Kishanbhai at the time of his arrest, is  actually  a  white  T-\nshirt with a trident design on it.  But, as per the  narration  recorded  by\nBababhai Naranbhai PW2, contained in the  complaint  which  constituted  the\nbasis of registering  the  first  information,  it  is  mentioned  that  the\naccused-respondent Kishanbhai was wearing a black T-shirt  at  the  time  of\nhis  detention.   It  is  apparent  from  the   factual   position   noticed\nhereinabove,  that  the  factual  position  expressed  by  the   complainant\nBababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2 was absolutely  incorrect,  and  contrary  to\nthe factual position.  In the above view of the  matter,  a  question  would\narise, whether the deposition of Bababhai Naranbhai  Solanki  PW2  was  fair\nand honest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_38\">(e)   According to the prosecution  version  of  the  incident,  the  search\nparty met the accused-respondent Kishanbhai at about  8:00  p.m.   The  said\nparty had thereupon proceeded to Jivi’s field, from where the dead  body  of\nthe victim was recovered.  According  to  Naranbhai  Manabhai  Solanki  PW5,\nafter finding the dead body, he had proceeded to  the  police  station.   At\nthe police station, he had requested the police personnel to visit the  site\nof occurrence.  Simultaneously, Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5  had  stated,\nthat when enquiries were being made from Kishanbhai,  police  personnel  had\ntaken away the accused-respondent.  According to the testimony of  Naranbhai\nManabhai Solanki PW5, therefore, at the most,  the  accused-respondent  must\nbe deemed to have been taken into police custody from  about  9:00  p.m.  on\n27.2.2003.  It is apparent, that the occurrence had come  to  the  knowledge\nof a large number  of  persons  constituting  the  search  party,  when  the\nvictim’s body was found on Jivi’s field.  Even  before  that,  the  accused-\nrespondent was already in police custody.  As if,  the  police  had  already\nconcluded on the guilt of Kishanbhai, even before  the  recovery  of  Gomi’s\nbody from Jivi’s farm.  Despite  the  above,  the  arrest  of  the  accused-\nrespondent Kishanbhai was shown at 6.40 a.m. on  28.3.2003.   The  detention\nof the accused-respondent Kishanbhai from 9:00 pm on 27.2.2003 to 6.40  a.m.\non 28.2.2003, shows that the prosecution has not presented the case  in  the\nmanner the events unfolded to the investigating agencies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">(f)   It also needs to  be  noticed,  that  the  inquest  panchnama  besides\nmentioning the amputation of the legs of the victim above her  ankles,  also\nrecords, that the silver  anklets  worn  by  Gomi  were  missing.   In  this\nbehalf, it would also be relevant to mention, that even though  the  inquest\npanchnama was drawn at 0030 a.m. on 28.2.2003, the  complaint  resulting  in\nthe registration of the first information  report  was  lodged  by  Bababhai\nNaranbhai Solanki PW2 at 3:05 a.m. on 28.02.2003.  It is strange,  that  the\ninquest panchnama should be drawn  before  the  registration  of  the  first\ninformation report.  It is  also  strange  as  to  how,  while  drawing  the\ninquest panchnama, the panchas of the same could have recorded,  that  after\namputation of the victim’s legs, her silver anklets had been taken  away  by\nthe offender.  There was no occasion for the panchas  to  have  known,  that\nGomi used to wear silver anklets.  Accordingly, there was  no  occasion  for\nthem to have recorded that the silver anklets usually worn by Gomi had  been\ntaken away by the offender.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_40\">(g)   From the prosecution version  (emerging  from  the  evidence  recorded\nbefore the Trial Court), it is apparent, that the  search  party,  as  also,\nthe relatives of the victim were aware at about 8:00 p.m. on 27.2.2003  that\nGomi had been murdered, with a possibility of her having  been  raped  also,\nand her silver anklets had been stolen.  Despite  the  above,  no  complaint\nwhatsoever came to be filed in connection with the above occurrence  at  the\npolice station on 27.2.2003, despite  the  close  coordination  between  the\nsearch party and the police from 8:00 pm onwards no 27.2.2003  itself.   The\ncomplaint leading to the filing of the first information was made  at  about\n3:05 a.m. on 28.2.2003.  Not only  is  the  delay  of  seven  hours  in  the\nregistration of  the  complaint  ununderstandable,  but  the  same  is  also\nrendered extremely suspicious, on the account of the fact that the  accused-\nrespondent Kishanbhai is acknowledged to be in police detention  since  9:00\np.m. on 27.2.2003 itself.  This may be the result of fudging  the  time  and\ndate at which the victim Gomi went missing, as also, the time  and  date  on\nwhich the body of the victim was discovered resulting in  the  discovery  of\nthe occurrence itself.  The question  which  arises  for  consideration  is,\nwhether the investigation agency adopted the usual practice  of  padding  so\nas  to  depict  the  occurrence  in  a  manner  different  from  the  actual\noccurrence.  A question also arises as to  why  it  was  necessary  for  the\ninvestigating agency to adopt the above practice, despite the fact  that  it\nwas depicted as an open and shut case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">(h)   As noticed above, that  from  the  statements  of  Bababhai  Naranbhai\nSolanki PW2 and Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5,  it  is  apparent  that  the\naccused  was  detained  by  the  police  informally  around  9:00  p.m.   on\n27.2.2003.  It is also essential to  notice,  that  an  acknowledgement  was\nmade to the above effect even  by  Sub  Inspector  Naranbhai  Lalbhai  Desai\nPW13, who had commenced investigation of the crime under reference.   It  is\napparent that when Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2, had  contacted  him  with\ndetails about the offence under reference, he had not recorded any entry  in\nthe station diary before leaving the police  station.   This  constitutes  a\nserious lapse in itself.  In his cross-examination, he had affirmed that  he\nwas taken by Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2, i.e., the  complainant  to  the\nscene of occurrence.  Having gone to the scene  of  occurrence,  and  having\nmade on the spot investigation,  he  acknowledged  having  returned  to  the\npolice station.  In his statement, he accepted, that when  he  had  returned\nto the police station after visiting the site of  occurrence,  the  accused-\nrespondent Kishanbhai was already  present  at  the  police  station.   When\nquestioned, he could not tender any explanation,  as  to  how  the  accused-\nrespondent Kishanbhai had come to the police station.  In his  statement  as\na witness, he had expressed, that  for  the  first  time  he  had  seen  the\naccused-respondent  Kishanbhai  only  on  28.2.2003  at  around  5:30   a.m.\nWhereafter, the accused-respondent was formally arrested at 6.40  a.m.   The\ninconsistency between the  statements  made  by  the  complainant  (Bababhai\nNaranbhai Solanki PW2) and his father (Naranbhai Manabhai  Solanki  PW5)  on\nthe one hand, and by Sub-Inspector  Naranbhai  Lalbhai  Desai  PW13  on  the\nother, discloses a serious contradiction with respect to  the  time  of  the\ndetention of the accused-respondent Kishanbhai.  It  needs  to  be  noticed,\nthat it was an aberration for Naranbhai Lalbhai Desai  PW13,  to  have  left\nthe police station without making  an  entry  in  the  station  diary.   Why\nshould a police officer, investigating a crime of  such  a  heinous  nature,\ncommit such a lapse?  The fact that he did so, is not a matter  of  dispute.\nThe truth of the matter is, that Naranbhai Lalbhai Desai PW13, did not  make\nany note either in the station diary or in any other register;  he  did  not\ntake any informal complaint from the complainant, even though  he  had  been\napprised about the commission of an offence.  It  is  therefore  clear  that\nNaranbhai Lalbhai Desai PW13, had left the police station without making  an\nentry depicting the purpose of his departure.  All this further adds to  the\nsuspicion of the manner in which investigation of the matter was conducted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">(i)   So  far  as  the  statement  of  Dinesh  Karshanbhai  Thakore  PW6  is\nconcerned, he had supported the prosecution  story  by  deposing,  that  the\naccused had visited his “lari” with a small child, about  seven  years  old.\nHe  had  further  asserted,  that  the  accused-respondent  Kishanbhai   had\npurchased a “dabeli” from him.  He  had  also  testified  that  the  accused\n–respondent had asked for a knife but he had  refused  to  give  it  to  him\nbecause, at the time when the accused-respondent  had  visited  the  “lari”,\nthere were several customers waiting for purchasing “dabelis”.   He  further\nconfirmed, that the accused-respondent had stolen a knife, used by  him  for\ncutting vegetables  from  his  “lari”.   Another  important  aspect  of  the\nmatter, out of the statement of Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6 is,  that  he\nidentified the shirt that the accused-respondent Kishanbhai was wearing,  at\nthe time when he had  visited  his  “lari”  for  purchasing  a  “dabeli”  on\n27.2.2003.  He had also identified  the  red  frock  which  the  victim  was\nwearing at the said juncture.  Additionally, he identified the  knife  which\nthe  accused-respondent  Kishanbhai  had  stolen  from  his   “lari”.    The\nstatement  of  Dinesh  Karshanbhai  Thakore  PW6  was   considered   to   be\nuntrustworthy by the High Court, primarily for  the  reason  that  he  could\nidentify the shirt worn by the accused-respondent, Kishanbhai  when  he  had\napproached his “lari” for the purchase of a  “dabeli”,  at  which  juncture,\nthe accused-respondent Kishanbhai may have remained at  the  “lari”  at  the\nmost for 10 to 15 minutes, when there was a rush of customers.   As  against\nthe above,  he  had  remained  with  the  accused-respondent  Kishanbhai  at\nNavrangpur Police Station, Ahmedabad, for approximately four hours.   During\nthe course of his cross-examination, he could not depose about the  sort  of\nshirt which the accused respondent was wearing,  at  the  Navrangpur  Police\nStation, Ahmedabad.  It is,  therefore,  apparent  that  Dinesh  Karshanbhai\nThakore PW6 was deposing far in excess of  what  he  remembered,  and/or  in\nexcess of what was actually to his knowledge.  He appears to  be  a  tutored\nwitness.  This aspect of the matter also renders  the  testimony  of  Dinesh\nKarshanbhai Thakore PW6, suspicious.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">(j)   There is yet another aspect of  the  controversy  relating  to  Dinesh\nKarshanbhai Thakore PW6.  The investigating agency  became  aware  from  the\ndisclosure  statement  of  the  accused-respondent  Kishanbhai  tendered  on\n1.3.2003, that he had procured the weapon of offence by way  of  theft  from\nthe  “lari”  of  Dinesh  Karshanbhai  Thakore  PW6.   The  above  knife  was\nrecovered at the instance of the accused-respondent Kishanbhai on  1.3.2003,\nin the presence of panch witnesses.  In the above view  of  the  matter,  in\nthe ordinary course of investigation, it would have been imperative for  the\ninvestigating agency  to  have  immediately  approached  Dinesh  Karshanbhai\nThakore  PW6,  to  record  his  statement.   His  statement  was   extremely\nimportant for the simple reason, that it would have  connected  the  accused\nwith the weapon with which the crime had been committed, as  also  with  the\nvictim.  Despite the above, the investigating agency recorded the  statement\nof Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6, for  the  first  time  on  4.3.2003.   No\nreason  is  forthcoming  why  his  statement  was  not  recorded  either  on\n1.3.2003, or on the  intervening  dates  before  4.3.2003.   The  inordinate\ndelay by the investigating agency, in confirming the version of the accused-\nrespondent, in respect of the weapon of the crime, renders  the  prosecution\nversion suspicious.  Such delay would not have taken place in  the  ordinary\ncourse of investigation.  If there were good reasons  for  the  delay,  they\nought to have been made  known  to  the  Trial  Court  by  way  of  reliable\nevidence.  This fact too  raises  a  doubt  about  the  correctness  of  the\nprosecution version of the incident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">The above discrepancies in the prosecution version,  were  duly  noticed  by\nthe High Court.  These constitute some of the glaring instances recorded  in\nthe impugned order.  Other instances of contradiction were also  noticed  in\nthe impugned order.  It is not necessary for  us  to  record  all  of  them,\nsince the above instances themselves are sufficient  to  draw  some  vitally\nimportant inferences.  Some of the inferences  drawn  from  the  above,  are\nbeing noticed below.  The prosecution’s  case  which  mainly  rests  on  the\ntestimony of Bababhai Naranbhai Solanki PW2, Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki  PW5\nand Dinesh Karshanbhai Thakore PW6, is unreliable because  of  the  glairing\ninconsistencies in their statements.  The  testimony  of  the  investigating\nofficer Naranbhai Lalbhai Desai PW13 shows fudging and padding,  making  his\ndeposition untrustworthy.  In the  absence  of  direct  oral  evidence,  the\nprosecution case almost wholly rested on the above mentioned witnesses.   It\nis for the above reasons, that the High Court through  the  impugned  order,\nconsidered  it  just  and  appropriate  to  grant   the   accused-respondent\nKishanbhai, the benefit of doubt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">13.

We  have  given  our  thoughtful  consideration  to  the  submissions\nadvanced at the hands of the learned counsel for the appellant,  which  have\nbeen duly noticed in paragraph 9 hereinabove.  It is also  relevant  for  us\nto record, that the learned counsel for the  appellant  did  not  advance  a\nsingle submission  in  addition  to  the  contentions  we  have  noticed  in\nparagraph 9 above.  The submissions advanced at the  hands  of  the  learned\ncounsel for  the  appellant,  were  sought  to  be  supported  by  judgments\nrendered by this Court, all of which have been referred to in  paragraph  13\nabove.  The submissions advanced at the hands of  the  learned  counsel  for\nthe appellant, based  on  each  of  the  judgments  cited,  have  also  been\nrecorded by us in the said paragraph.  Having  considered  the  totality  of\nthe facts and circumstances of  this  case,  specially  the  glaring  lapses\ncommitted in the investigation and prosecution  of  the  case  (recorded  in\nparagraph 11 of the instant judgment), as also the  inconsistencies  in  the\nevidence  produced  by  the  prosecution   (summarized   in   paragraph   12\nhereinabove),  we  are  of  the  considered  view,  that  each  one  of  the\nsubmissions advanced at the hands of the learned counsel for  the  appellant\nis meritless.  For the circumstantial evidence produced by the  prosecution,\nprimary reliance has been placed on the  statements  of  Bababhai  Naranbhai\nSolanki PW2, Naranbhai Manabhai Solanki PW5, and Dinesh Karshanbhai  Thakore\nPW6.  By demonstrating inconsistencies and infirmities in the statements  of\nthe above witnesses, their statements have  also  been  rendered  suspicious\nand accordingly unreliable.  There is also a serious impression  of  fudging\nand padding at the hands of the agencies involved.  As  a  matter  of  fact,\nthe  lack  of  truthfulness  of  the  statements  of  witnesses   has   been\ndemonstrated by means of simple logic emerging  from  the  factual  position\nexpressed through different prosecution witnesses (summarized in  paragraphs\n11 and 12 above).  The evidence produced to  prove  the  charges,  has  been\nsystematically  shattered,  thereby  demolishing  the  prosecution  version.\nMore than all that, is the non production of evidence which the  prosecution\nhas unjustifiably withheld, resulting in dashing all the States  efforts  to\nthe  ground.   It  is  not  necessary  for  us  to   record   our   detailed\ndetermination on the submissions  advanced  at  the  hands  of  the  learned\ncounsel for the appellant, for such reasons clearly emerge from the  factual\nposition noticed in paragraphs 11 and 12 hereinabove.  Recording of  reasons\nall over again, would just be a  matter  of  repetition.   In  view  of  the\nabove, we find  no  merit  in  this  appeal  and  the  same  is  accordingly\ndismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">15.    The  investigating  officials  and  the   prosecutors   involved   in\npresenting this case, have miserably failed  in  discharging  their  duties.\nThey have been instrumental in denying to serve the cause of  justice.   The\nmisery of the family of the  victim  Gomi  has  remained  unredressed.   The\nperpetrators of a horrendous crime, involving extremely ruthless and  savage\ntreatment  to  the  victim,  have  remained  unpunished.   A  heartless  and\nmerciless criminal, who has committed an extremely heinous crime,  has  gone\nscot-free.  He must be walking around in Ahmedabad, or some other  city/town\nin India, with his head held high.  A criminal on the  move.   Fearless  and\nfearsome.   Fearless  now,  because  he  could  not  be   administered   the\npunishment, he ought to have suffered.  And  fearsome,  on  account  of  his\nhaving remained unaffected by  the  brutal  crime  committed  by  him.   His\nactions now, know of no barriers.   He  could  be  expected  to  act  in  an\nunfathomable savage manner, uncomprehendable to a sane mind.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">16.   As we discharge our responsibility in deciding  the  instant  criminal\nappeal, we proceed to apply principles of law, and  draw  inferences.   For,\nthat is our job.  We are trained, not to be swayed by mercy  or  compassion.\nWe are trained  to  adjudicate  without  taking  sides,  and  without  being\nmindful of the consequences.  We are required to adjudicate on the basis  of\nwell drawn parameters.  We have done all that.   Despite  thereof,  we  feel\ncrestfallen, heartbroken and sorrowful.  We could not  serve  the  cause  of\njustice, to an innocent child.   We  could  not  even  serve  the  cause  of\njustice, to her immediate family.  The members of the family  of  Gomi  must\nnever have stopped cursing themselves, for not adequately  protecting  their\nchild from a prowler, who had snatched  an  opportunity  to  brutalise  her,\nduring their lapse in attentiveness.  And if the prosecution  version  about\nmotive is correct, the crime was  committed  for  a  mere  consideration  of\nRs.1,000/-.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">17.   Every time there is an acquittal, the consequences are just the  same,\nas have been noticed hereinabove.  The  purpose  of  justice  has  not  been\nachieved.  There is also another side to be taken  into  consideration.   We\nhave declared the accused-respondent innocent, by  upholding  the  order  of\nthe High Court, giving him the benefit of doubt.  He may be truly  innocent,\nor  he  may  have  succeeded  because  of  the  lapses  committed   by   the\ninvestigating/prosecuting teams.  If he has escaped, despite  being  guilty,\nthe investigating and the  prosecution  agencies  must  be  deemed  to  have\nseriously messed it all up.  And if the accused was  wrongfully  prosecuted,\nhis  suffering  is  unfathomable.   Here   also,   the   investigating   and\nprosecuting agencies are blameworthy.  It is  therefore  necessary,  not  to\noverlook even the hardship suffered by the accused, first during  the  trial\nof the case, and then at the appellate stages.  An innocent person does  not\ndeserve to suffer the turmoil of a long drawn litigation,  spanning  over  a\ndecade, or more.  The expenses incurred by an accused  in  his  defence  can\ndry up all his  financial  resources  –  ancestral  or  personal.   Criminal\nlitigation could also ordinarily involve financial borrowings.   An  accused\ncan be expected to be under a financial debt, by  the  time  his  ordeal  is\nover.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_63\">18.    Numerous  petitions  are  filed  before  this  Court,   praying   for\nanticipatory bail (under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 438</a> of the Code of Criminal  Procedure)  at\nthe behest of persons apprehending arrest, or for bail  (under  <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_30\">Section  439</a>\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure) at the behest of  persons  already  under\ndetention.  In a large number of such petitions, the main contention  is  of\nfalse implication.  Likewise, many petitions seeking  quashing  of  criminal\nproceeding (filed under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure)  come\nup for hearing day after day,  wherein  also,  the  main  contention  is  of\nfraudulent  entanglement/involvement.   In   matters   where   prayers   for\nanticipatory bail or for bail made under Sections 438 and  439  are  denied,\nor where a quashing  petition  filed  under  <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_32\">Section  482</a>  of  the  Code  of\nCriminal Procedure is declined, the person  concerned  may  have  to  suffer\nperiods of  incarceration  for  different  lengths  of  time.   They  suffer\ncaptivity and confinement most  of  the  times  (at  least  where  they  are\naccused of serious offences), till the culmination of their trial.  In  case\nof  their  conviction,  they  would  continue  in  confinement  during   the\nappellate stages also, and in matters which reach the  Supreme  Court,  till\nthe disposal of  their  appeals  by  this  Court.   By  the  time  they  are\nacquitted at the appellate stage, they may  have  undergone  long  years  of\ncustody.  When acquitted by this Court, they may have suffered  imprisonment\nof 10 years, or more.   When  they  are  acquitted  (by  the  trial  or  the\nappellate court), no one returns to them; what  was  wrongfully  taken  away\nfrom them.  The system responsible for the  administration  of  justice,  is\nresponsible for having deprived them of   their  lives,  equivalent  to  the\nperiod of their detention.   It is  not  untrue,  that  for  all  the  wrong\nreasons, innocent persons are subjected to suffer the ignominy  of  criminal\nprosecution and to suffer shame  and  humiliation.   Just  like  it  is  the\nbounden duty of a court to serve the cause of  justice  to  the  victim,  so\nalso, it is the bounden duty of a court to ensure that  an  innocent  person\nis not subjected to the rigours of criminal prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">19.   The situation <a href=\"/doc/130636232/\" id=\"a_33\">referred to above</a> needs to be remedied.   For  the  said\npurpose, adherence to a simple procedure  could  serve  the  objective.   We\naccordingly direct, that  on  the  completion  of  the  investigation  in  a\ncriminal case, the prosecuting agency should  apply  its  independent  mind,\nand require all shortcomings to be  rectified,  if  necessary  by  requiring\nfurther investigation.   It  should  also  be  ensured,  that  the  evidence\ngathered  during  investigation  is  truly  and  faithfully   utilized,   by\nconfirming that  all  relevant  witnesses  and  materials  for  proving  the\ncharges are conscientiously presented during the  trial  of  a  case.   This\nwould achieve two purposes.  Only persons against whom there  is  sufficient\nevidence, will have to  suffer  the  rigors  of  criminal  prosecution.   By\nfollowing the above procedure, in most criminal prosecutions, the  concerned\nagencies will be able to successfully establish the guilt of the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">20.   Every acquittal should be understood  as  a  failure  of  the  justice\ndelivery  system,  in  serving  the  cause  of  justice.   Likewise,   every\nacquittal should ordinarily lead to the inference, that an  innocent  person\nwas wrongfully prosecuted.  It is  therefore,  essential  that  every  State\nshould put in place a procedural mechanism,  which  would  ensure  that  the\ncause of justice is served, which would simultaneously ensure the  safeguard\nof interest of  those  who  are  innocent.   In  furtherance  of  the  above\npurpose, it is considered essential to direct the Home Department  of  every\nState, to examine all orders of acquittal and  to  record  reasons  for  the\nfailure of each prosecution case.  A standing committee of  senior  officers\nof the police and prosecution departments, should be vested  with  aforesaid\nresponsibility.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"130636232\" id=\"span_13\">The consideration at the  hands  of  the  above  committee,\nshould   be   utilized   for   crystalizing   mistakes   committed    during\ninvestigation, and/or prosecution, or both.  The Home  Department  of  every\nState Government will incorporate in its existing  training  programmes  for\njunior investigation/prosecution officials course- content  drawn  from  the\nabove consideration.  The same  should  also  constitute  course-content  of\nrefresher  training   programmes,   for   senior   investigating/prosecuting\nofficials.  The above responsibility for preparing training  programmes  for\nofficials, should be  vested  in  the  same  committee  of  senior  officers\n<a href=\"/doc/130636232/\" id=\"a_34\">referred to above</a>.  Judgments like the one in hand (depicting more  than  10\nglaring lapses in the investigation/prosecution of the  case),  and  similar\nother judgments, may also be added to the training programmes.   The  course\ncontent will be reviewed by the above committee annually, on  the  basis  of\nfresh  inputs,  including  emerging  scientific  tools   of   investigation,\njudgments of Courts, and on the basis of experiences gained by the  standing\ncommittee while examining failures, in unsuccessful  prosecution  of  cases.\nWe further direct, that the above training programme be put in place  within\n6 months. This would ensure that those persons who handle sensitive  matters\nconcerning investigation/prosecution are fully trained to handle  the  same.\nThereupon, if any lapses are committed by them, they would not  be  able  to\nfeign innocence, when they are made liable to  suffer  departmental  action,\nfor their lapses.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">21.   On the culmination of a criminal  case  in  acquittal,  the  concerned\ninvestigating/prosecuting official(s) responsible for  such  acquittal  must\nnecessarily be identified.  A finding needs to be  recorded  in  each  case,\nwhether the lapse was innocent or blameworthy.   Each  erring  officer  must\nsuffer the consequences of his lapse, by  appropriate  departmental  action,\nwhenever called for.  Taking  into  consideration  the  seriousness  of  the\nmatter,  the  concerned  official  may  be  withdrawn   from   investigative\nresponsibilities,  permanently  or  temporarily,  depending  purely  on  his\nculpability.  We also  feel  compelled  to  require  the  adoption  of  some\nindispensable measures, which may reduce the malady suffered by  parties  on\nboth  sides  of  criminal  litigation.   Accordingly  we  direct,  the  Home\nDepartment of every State Government, to formulate a  procedure  for  taking\naction  against  all  erring  investigating/prosecuting  officials/officers.\nAll such erring officials/officers identified, as  responsible  for  failure\nof a prosecution  case,  on  account  of  sheer  negligence  or  because  of\nculpable lapses, must  suffer  departmental  action.   The  above  mechanism\nformulated would infuse seriousness in the performance of investigating  and\nprosecuting duties, and would ensure that investigation and prosecution  are\npurposeful and decisive.  The instant direction shall also be  given  effect\nto within 6 months.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">22.   A copy of the instant judgment shall be transmitted  by  the  Registry\nof this Court, to the Home Secretaries of all State  Governments  and  Union\nTerritories, within one week.  All the  concerned  Home  Secretaries,  shall\nensure  compliance  of  the  directions  recorded  above.   The  records  of\nconsideration, in compliance with the above direction, shall be maintained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">23.   We hope and trust the Home Department of the State  of  Gujarat,  will\nidentify the erring officers in the instant case, and will take  appropriate\ndepartmental action against them,  as  may  be  considered  appropriate,  in\naccordance with law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">24.
