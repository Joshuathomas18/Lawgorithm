The\n\nsurvey of the house belonging to accused No. 5 was completed. Between 10 am\n\nand 10:30 am, the survey officials came to survey the house of CW 29. At that\n\nstage there was a verbal exchange between accused No. 5, Krishnappa and CW\n\n29, during the course of which, accused No. 5 sought to prevent survey of the\n\nhouse of CW 29 on the ground that there was a dispute in regard to the property\n\nin the civil court. There was an altercation between the two sides as a result of\n\nwhich the survey officials left the location. Subsequently, at around 12 noon, the\n\naccused came to the house of CW 29, allegedly armed with deadly weapons\n\nincluding a baku, knife, cycle chain and explosives. The case of the prosecution is\n\nthat accused No. 1 assaulted Krishnappa with a dagger. Accused No. 6 assaulted\n\nhim with a cycle chain. As a result, Krishnappa sustained severe injuries and\n\ncollapsed on the ground. Kenchappa, who was standing near Krishnappa was\n\nassaulted with a knife in the stomach by accused No. 3. Accused No. 2 was\n\nhandling an explosive, which he threw on the road which injured Sriramappa.

As a result of this,\n\nhe sustained injuries. The case of the prosecution is that accused No. 4 assaulted\n\nCW 29. Accused No. 6 assaulted Krishnappa with a cycle chain. Accused Nos. 7\n\nand 11 assaulted PW 7 while accused No. 8 assaulted CW 4 with a cycle chain. A\n\nrole is sought to be ascribed to three women i.e. accused Nos. 10, 11 and 12 from\n\nthe family who are alleged to have assaulted the side of the complainants with\n\nclubs. Both Kenchappa and Krishnappa died as a result of the injuries suffered by\n\nthem in the incident.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\n\n\n6     The First Information Report (FIR) was lodged by PW 1 Rani (the\n\ncomplainant) at 14:15 hours on the date of the incident at the Malur circle police\n\nstation. The prosecution examined twenty five witnesses in order to establish its\n\ncase. The defence of the accused was of total denial. The complainant was\n\nexamined as PW 1.

However, the evidence of\n              these witnesses uniformly indicates that A1 stabbed with a\n              baku on the right shoulder of Krishnappa and A6 hit with a\n              cycle chain on the back of deceased Krishnappa. A3 stabbed\n              with the knife on the abdomen of Kenchappa, it pierced\n              towards his back. Further it is also uniformly states A2 hurled\n              a hand bomb, it exploded, due to which PW5 Sriramappa\n              sustained injuries. When A2 tried to run, he fell into the\n              roadside ditch. Another hand bomb, which he was holding,\n              exploded and therefore A2 himself sustained injuries on both\n              the thighs. In this way it is stated by all these witnesses that\n              deceased Krishnappa and deceased Kenchappa were\n              murdered by these accused persons.”\n\n\n\n\nHowever, the Trial Court came to the conclusion that the accused were entitled to\n\nacquittal for the following reasons :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(i)     The evidence of PW 20 indicated that accused Nos. 2, 3, 4 and 5 had\n\n        sustained injuries in the course of the incident. The injuries which were\n\n        sustained by the accused were severe in nature. This indicates that the\n\n        incident had taken place in the course of a free fight between the families\n\n        of Gopalappa and Bachappa;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(ii)    Except for explaining the injury which was sustained by accused No. 2,\n\n        PWs 1 to 8 and 13 gave no explanation as to how the injuries were\n\n        sustained by accused Nos. 2 to 4;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(iii)   A cross complaint by accused No. 4 to the Malur Police Station against PW\n\n        3 was registered as Crime No. 112 of 1995 in which a B-final report was\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                          7</span>\n\f         submitted in 1999 to the JMFC, Malur.

Since the deceased was 6 feet in height, if he was hit with a\n\n         weapon like MO 5 by accused No. 1 whose height was 5.1 feet, the nature\n\n         of the injury would not have been slanting but vertical;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">(vi)     The Investigating officer had not collected the bloodstained earth for\n\n         analysis;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">(vii)    While the case of the prosecution is that Krishnappa was stabbed with a\n\n         knife, what has been seized was a baku or dagger which is stated to have\n\n         been used to stab him, which was marked as MO 5; and\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">(viii)   CW 29, who was one of the eye-witnesses, had not been examined.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">         Besides, there were certain contradictions in the evidence of PW 3 and\n\n         PW 4.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">\n8        The High Court, in the course of its judgment, adverted to the principles\n\nwhich it was required to follow in an appeal against acquittal, formulating them in\n\nthe following terms :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                 “1.

If the Appellate Court finds that the appreciation of\n                evidence by the Trial court is without evidence or\n                capricious or against the interest of justice, then only the\n                Appellate Court would venture to reverse the order of\n                acquittal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">             4.

Moreover, it\n\nwas specifically stated that accused No. 2 was injured, as the explosive\n\nsubstances in his custody exploded as he was fleeing. In the view of the High\n\nCourt, the evidence of the injured eye-witnesses namely PWs 3, 5, 6, and 7\n\nadverted to the overt acts of each of the accused. PWs 2, 4, 8 and 13 were eye-\n\nwitnesses to the incident. The evidence of the injured eye-witnesses could not be\n\nlightly brushed aside. The High Court noted that none of the injured witnesses\n\nwere armed with any weapons at the time of the offence. On the other hand, the\n\naccused were in possession of weapons including baku, knife, cycle chain and\n\nclubs. Hence, it was proved that the accused had taken part in the incident on the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                       9</span>\n\fdate of the offence and had caused the death of two persons and injuries on four\n\nothers. As regards the alleged failure of the prosecution to explain the injury on\n\nthe accused, the High Court noted that the FIR adverts to the injury sustained by\n\naccused No. 2. As far as the other injured accused were concerned, the police\n\nfiled a B-report, which was accepted by the Magistrate and had not been pursued\n\nfurther by the accused. While reversing the acquittal of the accused, the High\n\nCourt nonetheless noted that there was an age old enmity between the side of\n\nthe accused and the family of the deceased, as a result of which a quarrel took\n\nplace and the offence cannot be regarded as having been committed with an\n\nintention to cause the death of the deceased. The High Court held that having\n\nregard to the nature of the weapons in their custody, the accused would have the\n\nknowledge that their acts would cause the death of Kenchappa and Krishnappa.\n\nHence, the conviction was ordered under Section 304 Part I, besides the\n\nconviction under Section 324, both read with Section 149.\n\n\n\n\n10        Assailing the judgment of the High Court, Shri V Krishnamurthy, learned\n\nSenior Counsel appearing on behalf of the accused appellants urged the\n\nfollowing submissions:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(i)       In an appeal against acquittal, the High Court has not found the judgment of\n\nthe Trial court to be either perverse or resulting in a miscarriage of justice.

State of Bihar</a> [(1976) 4 SCC 394 :\n               1976 SCC (Cri) 671 : AIR 1976 SC 2263] ).”\n\n\n\nIn <a href=\"/doc/140419148/\" id=\"a_8\">Raghubir Singh v State of Rajasthan6</a>, a two judge Bench of this Court held\n\nthus:</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">4 (2002) 7 SCC 91\n5 (2005) 9 SCC 705\n6 (2011) 12 SCC 235\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                              19</span>\n\f              “14...each and every injury on an accused is not required to\n              be explained and more particularly where all the injuries\n              caused to the accused are simple in nature (as in the present\n              case) and the facts of the case have to be assessed on the\n              nature of probabilities...”\n\n\nThe evidence of PW 20 notes the injuries which were sustained by accused No. 2\n\nthus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">              “1. A white blast injury tearing of the skin cub-cutaneous\n              tissue and partly of quadriceps muscle covering almost entire\n              half of left thigh with profused bleeding a doubtful fracture of\n              left femur.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">              2.

The injuries sustained by the\n\nother accused were evidently simple injuries.                The pellet injuries suffered by\n\naccused No. 3 were traceable to the bomb blasts caused by accused No. 2. The\n\ninjuries suffered by accused Nos. 4 and 5 were of a simple nature.\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_32\">20      On the above state of the record, it is abundantly clear that the judgment of\n\nthe Trial court suffers from a manifest perversity. The Trial court at one stage,\n\nadverted to the injuries sustained by the four accused persons as “fatal injuries”\n\nignoring that there had been no death in the course of the incident on the side of\n\nthe accused. At other places in the course of the judgment, the Trial court opined\n\nthat the injuries were severe. Here again, there was an evident and manifest\n\nerror on the part of the Trial court in failing to notice that the pellet injuries which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                             20</span>\n\fwere sustained by accused No. 3 were a result of the explosion of the bomb\n\nwhich had been handled by accused No. 2. The other injuries sustained by the\n\naccused were relatively of a minor nature. That apart, it has emerged on the\n\nrecord that in the cross complaint which was filed by the side of the accused, the\n\npolice, after investigation, submitted a B summary report which was accepted by\n\nthe Magistrate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">\n21      The principal basis on which the Trial court acquitted the accused is\n\ncontrary to the evidence on the record and suffers from a manifest perversity.\n\nThe evidence on the record is indicative of the following circumstances:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">(i) As a result of the incident, two persons – Kenchappa and Krishnappa\n\n     suffered homicidal death in the family of the complainant and as many as six\n\n     persons were injured;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">(ii) None of the persons in the family of the complainant were armed;\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">(iii) On the contrary, it was the side of the accused which came to the house of\n\n     the complainant armed with weapons such as baku, knife, cycle chains and\n\n     explosives;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">(iv) The injury sustained by the two deceased persons were on vital parts of the\n\n     body namely, lungs and kidney; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">(v) After the initial altercation took place at 10:30 am and the survey officers had\n\n     left the location, the accused returned armed with lethal weapons and during\n\n     the course of the incident caused serious injuries on Krishnappa and\n\n     Kenchappa resulting in their death.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                  21</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">\fBesides the perversity in the judgment of the Trial Court noted earlier, it is evident\n\nthat the judgment proceeded on the basis of surmises.                            The Trial court\n\nhypothesised that since the deceased was 6 ft. in height and accused No. 1 was\n\n5 ft. in height, the injuries, if caused by a dagger, would have been slanting and\n\nnot vertical in nature. This has completely ignored the vital aspects of the medical\n\nevidence on the record. The contradictions which the Trial court adverted to in\n\nthe evidence of PWs 3 and 4 were not of a nature that should result in\n\ndiscrediting the entire case of the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">\n\n22     For these reasons, we have come to the conclusion that the High Court\n\nwas fully justified in reversing the judgment of acquittal, having due regard to the\n\nparameters which govern the exercise of its jurisdiction in an appeal against\n\nacquittal. Having regard to the facts and circumstances of this case, we are of the\n\nview that the High Court was correct in coming to the conclusion that the\n\nprovisions of Section 149 of the Code stand attracted. Section 149 reads thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1048134\" id=\"span_32\">“Section 149.

Once a\n\ncommon object of an unlawful assembly is established, it is not necessary that all\n\npersons who form the unlawful assembly must be demonstrated to have\n\ncommitted the overt act.

The “common object” of\n               an assembly is to be ascertained from the acts and language\n               of the members composing it, and from a consideration of all\n               the surrounding circumstances.
