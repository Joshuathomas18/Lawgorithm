Brief facts of the case are that on 17/06/09 at about\n2-00 p.m., unknown person informed police station Sitamau on\ntelephone that Roop Kunwar Sathan has been shot near old\nCourt gate,   Post Office Gali, Sitamau. The aforesaid\ninformation was recorded in Roznamacha Sanha No. 701 and\nSHO Police B.L.Avasya        (PW/17) along with police force\nreached the Post Office Gali, Sitamau where Roop Kunwar\nwas lying in the injured condition. Anita (PW/5) along with\nPalladi Bai and Naurangi Bai (PW/8) were present, injured\nRoop Kunwar was taken to Govt. Hospital, Sitamau. The\ndaughter of the injured Roop Kunwar lodged the report alleging\nthat she was coming with her mother Roop Kunwar from bank.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                  3</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">When they reached near old Court gate, Post Office Gali,\nSitamou, Rameshchandra S/o Onkarlal Sharma, Sunil S/o\nRameshchandra, Rajesh S/o Rameshchandra, Pramod S/o\nKanhaiyalal,   Narendra    S/o       Shyamkumar,   Sanjay   S/o\nShyamkumar, Sharda Bai W/o Rameshchandra and Anju d/o\nRameshchandra have surrounded her mother. Sunil, Sanjay\nand Narendra were having pistol. They fired at her mother.\nRamesh Sharma also fired on her mother, who sustained\ninjuries on her head, jaw and fell down. The incident was\nwitnessed by Palladi Bai and Naurangi Bai (PW/8). The\nincident has been caused due to previous enmity. Dehati\nNalishi (Ex.P/3) was recorded by O.K.Singh (PW/12) on the\nspot which was sent through Surendra Singh, P.S. Sitamau\nwhere Crime No. 193/09 under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_11\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_12\">149</a> and <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_13\">307</a>\nof the IPC was registered. The injured was referred to District\nHospital, Mandsaur, where she was declared dead. The\ninformation was sent to Kotwali Mandsaur where Merg\nintimation No. 65/09 was recorded. During enquiry, Panchnama\nof the dead body was prepared and dead body was sent for\npostmortem examination. During investigation, B.L.Avasya\n(PW/17) has recorded the statements of the witnesses. He also\ncollected blood stained earth and plane earth, empty\ncartridges, sleeper of the injured Roop Kunwar. Site map was\nalso prepared. The articles were sent for examination to FSL\nSagar. Thereafter, accused persons were arrested and after\ncompletion of the investigation, charge-sheet has been filed in\nthe Court of Judicial Magistrate, First Class, Sitamau, who has\ncommitted the case to the learned trial Court. The learned trial\nCourt frame and explained the charges. Appellants abjured\ntheir guilt and claimed that they have falsely been implicated\ndue to enmity. Defence of accused person Ramesh Chandra,\nSharda Bai, was that they were not present at the spot.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                4</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">Defence of accused Sanjay was that he has gone with Medical\nOfficer on tour and came alongwith him thereafter he took\nRoop Kunwar on vehcle to Mandsour. Defence of Megha is that\nshe was in her Saural. The prosecution has examined as many\nas 18 witnesses in support of its case while in defence, four\nwitnesses have been examined. Learned trial Court after\nscrutinizing the evidence and material on record, convicted the\nappellants   Narendra,   Rameshchandra        and   Sunil    while\nacquitted Sanjay, Pramod, Sharda and Anju. Feeling aggrieved\nwith the conviction and acquittal, the aforesaid appeal has\nbeen preferred.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_5\">3.    Learned     counsel   appearing    on    behalf   of    the\nappellant/Narendra in criminal appeal No. 397/11 submitted\nthat learned trial Court has not correctly and properly\nappreciated the evidence. Learned trial Court erred in relying\non the statement of Anita (PW/5), who claimed to be eye\nwitness of the incident pointing out that Anita has specifically\nstated that who caused gun shot injury, she doesn&#x27;t know. It is\nfurther submitted that the testimony of Anita (PW/5) and\nNaurangi Bai (PW/8) cannot be believed as they are relative\nand interested witness and no any independent witness has\nbeen examined though available. No weapon has been\nrecovered from the possession of the appellant. It is further\nsubmitted that learned trial Court on the same set of evidence\nacquitted co-accused Sanjay, Pramod, Sharda and Anju while\nconvicted the appellant disbelieving the statements of the\ndefence witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">4.    Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the appellants\nRamesh and Sunil submitted that appellants have wrongly\nbeen convicted. There is no reliable evidence against the\npresent appellants. Learned trial Court has not properly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                 5</span>\n\nconsidered the evidence and material on record. There is\ninterpolation in the report regarding time of the incident.\nLearned trial Court has failed to consider that the presence of\nAnita (PW/5), the daughter of the deceased at the time of\nalleged incident at the spot is doubtful. Referring the statement\nof B.L.Avasya (PW/17), the investigating Officer, it is contended\nthat shopkeepers of the shop situated near the place of the\nincident have stated that two Nakabposh persons have shot\nfire at the deceased and flew away. He invited our attention\ntowards the statement of Shankarlal (PW/10) and has\nsubmitted that on the date of incident, Yashpal Katlana had\nannounced &quot;Sitamau Band&quot; on the pretext that some unknown\npersons have murdered Roop Kunwar. It was also announced\nthat the memorandum should be given to SDM. This\nannouncement was made at 8-9 p.m. At this call, Sitamau was\nclosed on the next day of the incident. It is submitted that\nappellants have falsely been implicated due to previous enmity.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">5.    Learned     counsel    appearing     on   behalf   of   the\nappellant/State in criminal appeal No. 371/15 has submitted\nthat learned trial Court has wrongly acquitted the respondents\nSanjay, Pramod, Sharda and Anju while on the same evidence\nrespondents Narendra, Rameshchandra and Sunil have been\nconvicted. It is further submitted that from the evidence led by\nthe prosecution, it is proved that respondents were the\nmembers of the unlawful assembly. They came armed with\npistol. Respondent/Sharda Sharma has caught hold the hand\nof the deceased. It is further submitted that the evidence of the\neye witness is fully corroborated by the medical evidence.\nLearned trial Court has not properly appreciated the evidence\nand erred in acquitting the respondents.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                 6</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">6.     Learned Govt. Advocate appearing on behalf of\nrespondent/State in criminal appeal No. 397/11 and 456/11\nsupported the conviction of the appellants and submitted that\nlearned trial Court has rightly convicted these appellants on the\nbasis of the evidence available on record. It is further submitted\nthat in the report lodged by Anita (PW/5), the appellants have\nbeen named in the FIR. The testimony of eye witness Anita is\nfully corroborated by the medical evidence, therefore, there is\nno ground to interfere in the well merited findings recorded by\nthe learned trial Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.     Learned counsel appearing on behalf of respondents\nSanjay, Pramod, Sharda and Anju submitted that learned trial\nCourt has rightly appreciated the evidence available on record.\nProsecution has miserably failed to prove the charges against\nthe respondents, therefore, there is no reason to interfere in the\nwell merited acquittal of the respondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">8.     We have heard the arguments advanced by the parties\nand carefully perused the evidence and material available in\nrecord of the trial Court. As regards the homicidal death of\ndeceased, Anita (PW/5), Naurangi Bai (PW/8) have stated that\nRoop Kunwar has sustained injury by means of gun shot.\nDoctor Bhupendra Jain (PW/1) examined Roop Kunwar and\naccording to him, he found one lacerated wound behind right\near caused by gun shot, one lacerated wound over right angle\nof mouth and neck and lacerated wound of both upper and left\nlip. He found Roop Kunwar in a serious condition and referred\nher for further treatment to District Hospital, Mandsaur where\ndoctor Pradeep Sharma (PW/6) found her dead. Doctor\nM.S.Chouhan (PW/14) conducted the postmortem and mode of\ndeath was shock and cause of death was haemorrhage due to\ngun shot injury.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                    7</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">9.     Thus, from the evidence, it is proved that the death of\nRoop Kunwar was homicidal in nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">10.     The conviction of the appellants Narendra, Ramesh\nChandra and Sunil is recorded relying on the testimony of Anita\n(P.W/3) and Naurangi Bai (P.W/8), who are daughter and sister\nof the deceased. Learned Counsel assailed the evidence of the\naforesaid eye witness submitting that they are close relives of\nthe deceased and there is previous enemity, no independent\nwitness have been examined hence their evidence can not be\nrelied on.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"105640015\" id=\"span_7\">11.    It is well settled that only on the ground of relationship,\nthe testimony of the witnesses cannot be disbelieved or thrown\nout if it is otherwise found to be believable and trustworthy.\nHowever, the evidence of such relative/interested witnesses\nhas to be closely scrutinized. In other words, the evidence of\nrelative/interested witnesses requires greater care and caution\nwhile scrutinizing the evidence, Court has to address to itself\nwhether there are any infirmities in the evidence of such a\nwitness, whether the evidence is reliable and trustworthy and\nwhether the genesis of the crime unfolded by such an incident\nis probable or not. If the evidence of any interested\nwitness/relative witness on a careful scrutiny is found to be\nconsistent and trustworthy, free from infirmities or any\nembellishment, there is no reason not to place reliance on the\nsame.

Anita (PW/5) has deposed that on 17/06/09 at about 1-30\np.m., she along with her mother Roop Kunwar were coming\nafter withdrawing amount from the bank when they reached in\nfront of old Court, five persons namely Narendra, Sanjay, Sunil,\nRamesh and Rajesh came from Rajwada Chowk side and\nAnju, Sharda and Pramod came from the side of Post Office\nGali. After seeing them, her mother told her to run, then she\nmoved ahead and reached near milk dairy. She saw that Sunil,\nRajesh, Rameshchandra and Narendra holding pistol with\nthem. Anju caught hold left hand of her mother and Sharda\ncaught hold right hand of her mother. She heard 3-4 shots of\nfire arm, her mother fell down. Who fired gun shot, she could\nnot say. Those, who came from the side of Rajwada, went\ntowards Rajwada side and those, who came from the side of\nPost Office Gali, went towards that side. She further stated that\nthereafter she rushed to the spot. Her maternal aunt Naurangi\nBai (PW/8) was coming from the side of Rajwada along with\nPalladi Bai. She left them near her mother and went to her\nhouse and brought spirit and bandage and did bandage of her\nmother. Police reached the spot, they took         her mother to\nSitamau hospital, from where she was taken to Mandsaur\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                 9</span>\n\nwhere she lodged the report which was recorded as Dehati\nNalishi vide Ex.P/3.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">13.   Naurangi Bai (PW/8) testified that at about 1-30 p.m.,\nAnita and Roop Kunwar were going towards house, Sharda,\nPramod and Anju came from the side of Post Office Gali and\nSunil, Rajesh, Sanjay, Narendra and Ramesh came from the\nside of Rajwada and surrounded Roop Kunwar. Sunil, Rajesh,\nRamesh and Narendra were armed with pistol and fired at\nRoop Kunwar. She further stated that she and Palladi Bai were\ncoming from Khadi market, Sharda and Anju caught hold the\nhand of Roop Kunwar. Roop Kunwar sustained injuries near\nright ear, eye and right side of the face and mouth. Anita came\nthere shouting to save her mother, but none turned up. She\nand Palladi Bai rushed to the spot, Anita brought bandage and\npolice reached the spot. Police took her to Sitamau and\nthereafter to District Hospital, Mandsaur where doctor told that\nRoop Kunwar is dead.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">14.   Naurangi Bai (PW/8) in para-26 has stated that she used\nto sleep in footpath of the bus stand. In the night, prior to the\ndate of incident, she slept in bus stand along with Palladi Bai.\nAfter she got awaken in the morning, she went to collect\nKachra for about 2-3 hours. Thereafter, she went to beg meal\nand was going to bus stand from Khadi Bazar. She has not\nseen Roop Kunwar and Anita going towards bank. In para-28,\nshe denied that she was coming behind Anita and Roop\nKunwar. She has stated that she was coming from the side of\nKhadi Bazar and Anita and Roop Kunwar were coming from the\nside of Bhagoria Darwaza. In para-29, she denied that in her\ncase-diary statement (Ex.D/7) she has stated that she along\nwith Palladi Bai were coming behind Roop Kunwar and Anita.\nWhy the statement marked A to A is mentioned in case-diary\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                10</span>\n\nstatement (Ex.D/7) she can&#x27;t say.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">15.   In para-38, B.L.Avasya (PW/17) has stated that he has\nwritten the statement marked A to A in (Ex.D/7) as stated by\nNaurangi Bai (PW/8). Naurangi Bai (PW/8) has not stated in\nher case-diary statement that Anita and Roop Kunwar were\ncoming from the side of Bhagoria Darwaza. In para-39 of his\nstatement, he has categorically stated that Naurangi Bai\n(PW/8) has not stated in her case-diary statement (Ex.D/7) that\nshe was coming along with Palladi Bai from Khadi Bazar. In the\nsite map (Ex.P/22) it appears that post office gali and Bhagoria\nDarwaza are on opposite side. The location of Khadi Bazar has\nnot been shown. According to Anita (PW/5), she and her\nmother were coming from the side of post office gali. In light of\nthe statement of Anita (PW/5), the statement of Naurangi Bai\nthat Anita and her mother were coming from the side of\nBhagoria Darwaza becomes doubtful. The statement of\nNaurangi Bai that she along with Palladi Bai were coming from\nthe side of Khadi Bazar is contradicted by her own case-diary\nstatement (Ex.D/7), wherein she has stated that she was\ncoming along with Palladi Bai behind Anita and Roop Kunwar.\nThis contradiction raises a doubt about the presence of\nNaurangi Bai at the time of alleged incident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">16.   Naurangi Bai (PW/8) in para-30 of her statement has\nstated that she has told the police that Sharda Sharma,\nPramod and Anju Sharma came from the side of post office gali\nand Sunil Sharma, Rajesh, Sanjay, Narendra and Ramesh\ncame from the side of Rajwada. Why the aforesaid fact is not\nmentioned in her case-diary statement (Ex.D/7) she cannot\nsay. B.L.Avasya (PW/17) in para-39 of his statement has\ncategorically denied that Naurangi Bai (PW/8) told him in\n(Ex.D/7) that Sharda, Pramod and Anju came from post office\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                               11</span>\n\ngali and Sunil, Rajesh, Sanjay, Narendra and Ramesh came\nfrom Rajwada side. According to Naurangi Bai (PW/8), she also\nstated the police that she and Palladi Bai were coming from the\nside of Khadi Bazar and were 20 paces away from the place of\nincident. Why this fact is not mentioned in (Ex.D/7), she can&#x27;t\nsay. B.L.Avasya (PW/17) in para-39 of his statement says that\nNaurangi Bai (PW/8) has not told him that she and Palladi Bai\nwere coming from the side of Khadi Bazar and they were 20\npaces away from the place of occurrence. Naurangi Bai (PW/8)\nin para-31 of her statement says that she told the police that\nAnju Sharma and Sharda Sharma caught hold the hands of\nRoop Kunwar. Roop Kunwar sustained injures near right ear on\nthe face and mouth. She also stated that Anita came running\nand shouted. She also stated that accused persons have\nsurrounded the mother and her daughter had shouted to save\nher mother, but none turned up. She also stated that she and\nPalladi Bai rushed to the spot and picked up Roop Kunwar and\nAnita brought bandage from her house and applied the\nbandage. Why the aforesaid facts are not mentioned in her\nstatement (Ex.D/7) she can&#x27;t say. B.L.Avasya in para-39 and 40\ndenied that the aforesaid facts have been mentioned by\nNaurangi bai in her case-diary statement (Ex.D/7). Thus, the\nomission of the aforesaid facts in the case-diary statement\n(Ex.D/7) of Naurangi Bai (PW/8) indicates that she has made\nimprovement in her version before the Court statement on\nmaterial points.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">17.   Naurangi Bai (PW/8) in para-33 of her statement has\nstated that Roop Kunwar was taken by the police on jeep to\nSitamau Hospital. Doctor checked her and thereafter she was\nreferred to Mandsaur. She doesn&#x27;t know that the vehicle on\nwhich Roop Kunwar was taken to Mandsaur was driven by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                 12</span>\n\naccused Sanjay, but immediately said that the vehicle was\ndriven by accused Sanjay. Accused Sanjay was among the\naccused persons, who surrounded Roop Kunwar and Anita at\nthe time of commission of the incident and had incident was\nwitnessed by Naurangi Bai (PW/8) then there was no reason\nfor Naurangi Bai not to tell the police, who were present in the\nvehicle on which Roop Kunwar was taken to Mandsaur that the\ndriver driving the vehicle is involved in the commission of the\nincident. But Naurangi Bai (PW/8) remained mum. This\nconduct of Naurangi Bai (PW/8) is most unnatural and raises a\ndoubt about presence of Naurangi Bai (PW/8) at the time of\nincident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">18.   In para-10, Naurangi Bai (PW/8) says that she has never\naccompanied Roop Kunwar to attend the Court in criminal\ncases. She came for the first time in the Court for giving\nstatement, but in para-12 she says that she had appeared in\ntwo cases as a witness on the report of Roop Kunwar. Thus,\nthis witness is trying to hide the fact that she was the witness in\nthe earlier cases instituted on the report of Roop Kunwar. In\npara-11, she says that she doesn&#x27;t remember that on 03/03/10,\nshe went to give the statement in Sitamau Court. When the\ncertified copy of the statement (Ex.D/6) was read over to this\nwitness, she denied that such statement has been given by\nher. This again shows that this witness can make a false\nstatement to any extent. The suggestion has been given to\nNaurangi Bai (PW/8) in para-45 that she was sitting near Aara\nmachine, where Abdul Hamid informed her that somebody\nkilled her sister, then she went to post office gali. This\nsuggestion has been denied by Naurangi Bai (PW/8).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">19.   Considering the aforesaid analysis of the statement of\nNaurangi Bai (PW/8), who is the real sister of the deceased, we\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                 13</span>\n\nfind that she has improved her version before the Court on the\nmaterial facts, there are material contradiction in her case-diary\nstatement and the statement before the Court and also there\nare material omission in her case diary statements. Her\ntestimony is not free from embellishment. The presence         of\nNaurangi Bai (PW/8) at the place of incident appears to be\ndoubtful. It seems to us that Naurangi Bai reached the spot\nafter she came to know about the incident. Naurangi Bai is the\nreal sister of the deceased hence she is interested witness. Her\nstatements suffers from various infirmities and not cogent and\nconsistent hence does not inspire confidence of the Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">20.     Anita (PW/5) in para-70 of her statement has stated that\non the date of the incident, she was in her house. She left\nalong with her mother at 11-30 a.m. In para-77 she stated that\nshe and her mother spent half and hour in the bank. Thereafter,\nsome ladies met and her mother talked to them. She can not\nsay how much time her mother talked with other ladies. In\npara-78 she says that marriage of his brother was settled and\nRs. 5,000/- has been withdrawn for the purpose of shopping by\nwithdrawal form which was filled up by her. To show the\npresence of this witness along with Roop Kunwar, the\npassbook and the withdrawal form filled by this witness were\nvery material but has not been brought on record. B.L.Awasya\n(P.W.17) in para-69 says that he has not verified the above\nfact.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">21.     Anita (PW/5) in para-86 of her statement says that\nNaurangi Bai and Palladi Bai were coming from the side of\nRajwada Chowk and she did not see other person, but\nimmediately changed her version and says that five accused\npersons also came from the side of Rajwada, who were ahead\nof Naurangi Bai and Palladi Bai. In para-100 of her statement,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                 14</span>\n\nshe stated that in the report and in the statement made to\npolice, she told that five accused persons came from the side\nof Rajwada and three accused persons came from the side of\npost office gali. She also stated the police that        Sharda,\nPramod and Anju came from post office gali and Sunil, Rajesh,\nSanjay, Narendra and Ramesh came from Rajwada side. She\nalso stated that on seeing the accused persons, her mother\ntold her to run away, then she rushed to the milk dairy and\nstood there. In para-102, she also stated that all the eight\naccused persons surrounded her mother. She also said that\nfour persons were having pistol in their hands. In para-103, she\nalso stated that Anju caught hold the left hand of her mother\nand Sharda caught hold the right hand of her mother. In para-\n103 she stated that 3-4 fires were made and five persons went\ntowards the side from where they came and three persons\nwent to the side from where they came. Why the aforesaid\nfacts are not mentioned in the report (Ex.P/3) and the case-\ndiary statement (Ex.D/5), she can&#x27;t say.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">22.   Shri O.K.Singh (PW/12) in para-4 has denied that\ncomplainant has told him that Sharda, Pramod and Anju came\nfrom post office gali and Sunil, Rajesh, Sanjay, Narendra and\nRamesh came from Rajwada side. Anita has also not\nmentioned that on seeing them, her mother told her to run\naway, then she rushed towards the milk dairy and stood there.\nAnita has also not told that all the eight accused persons\nsurrounded them and four of them armed with pistol. Anita has\nalso not told him that Anju caught hold the left hand of her\nmother and Sharda caught hold the right hand of her mother. In\npara-5, he further stated that Anita has also not told him that 3-\n4 fire was shot and her mother fell down and Sunil was\nstanding behind her mother. Pramod and Ramesh saw the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                15</span>\n\nbody of her mother and five persons went towards the side\nfrom where they came and three persons went towards those\nside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">23.     B.L.Avasya (PW/17) has also stated in para-33, 34, 35,\n36 &amp; 37 that Anita (PW/5) has not told him in her statement\n(Ex.D/5) that Sharda, Pramod and Anju came from post office\ngali and Sunil, Rajesh, Sanjay, Narendra and Ramesh came\nfrom Rajwada side. On seeing the accused persons, her\nmother asked her to run away and she rushed to the milk dairy\nand stood there. Anita (PW/5) has also not stated that four\npersons were having pistol in their hands. She has also not told\nhim that accused Sunil was standing on the back side of her\nmother and five persons went on the side from where they\ncame and three persons went to the side from where they\ncame.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_26\">24.     Thus, from the aforesaid statement of O.K.Singh\n(PW/12) and B.L.Avasya (PW/17) it becomes clear that Anita\nhas improved her version before the Court. The omission of the\nmaterial facts in the report (Ex.P/3) and (Ex.D/5) raises a doubt\nas to the presence of Anita (PW/5) at the time of alleged\nincident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">25.     According to Anita (PW/5) she witnessed the incident\nfrom milk dairy. As per the site map (Ex.P/13), the distance of\nplace from where Anita was standing, the place of the incident\nhas been shown as 40 ft. 6 inches. Anita in para-108 says that\nwhen she was crying, noone came there. She further admitted\nthat shopkeepers of the shops adjacent to the place of incident\nwere open. Shopkeepers were present in their shops, but they\nhave not come.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                   16</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">26.   From perusal of the site map (Ex.P/13) and the\nstatement of Anita (PW/5), it is gathered that there were many\nshops There is a Rajwada chowk near the place of occurrence\nand also an old Court building. The incident alleged to have\nbeen taken place at about 1-30 P.M. according to Anita (PW/5).\nIn such circumstances, it is very difficult to believe the\nstatement of Anita (PW/5) that none including the shopkeepers\nreached the place of occurrence even after she was shouting.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">27.   Anita (PW/5) is the daughter of the deceased. Her\nconduct even after seeing the accused persons appears to be\nunnatural. It also appears very unnatural that the deceased\nafter seeing the accused persons asked her daughter to run\naway, but she herself did not tried to save herself by running\naway. Had the mother of Anita (PW/5) after seeing the accused\npersons asked Anita to run away, the natural conduct of Anita\nwould have been to save her mother but she ran away alone.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">28.   The omission of the fact that after seeing the accused\npersons, mother of Anita (PW/5) asked her to run away and\nshe ran away and stood near milk dairy from where she\nwitnessed the incident does not find place in the report (Ex.P/3)\nas well as in the statement (Ex.D/5) of Anita (PW/5). The\nomission of this material fact again raises a question mark as\nto reliability of Anita (PW/5).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">29.   Anita (PW/5) in para-88 says that she reached near her\nmother from milk dairy, the accused persons had already left\nthe place. In para-87, Anita (PW/5) says that she put head of\nher mother on hand and on seeing blood, she ran to her\nhouse,which is about one furlong away (as per statement of\npara 41 of B.L Awasya(P.W.17), took the bandage and reached\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                17</span>\n\nthe spot. When specific question was asked where Naurangi\nBai and Palladi Bai reached the spot when she came at the\nspot, she replied that when she did &quot;GardanToki&quot; then Naurangi\nBai and Palladi Bai came. In para-89, Anita (PW/5) says that\nNaurangi Bai and Palladi Bai have not extended any help when\nshe administered medicine and did bandage after raising the\nneck of her mother. From this statement, it appears that\nNaurangi Bai (PW/8) and Palladi Bai reached the spot after the\nincident. Had Naurangi Bai (PW/8) witnessed the incident and\nreached the spot immediately there was no reason for\nNaurangi Bai (PW/8) not to help Anita Bai (PW/5) in\nadministering the medicine and bandage the deceased\nbecause Naurangi Bai (PW/8) is the real sister of the\ndeceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">30.   It is surprising that Anita (PW/5) after seeing the accused\npersons firing at her mother and her mother fell down, and\naccused persons have left the place instead of taking care of\nher mother goes to her house which is one furlong away and\ndid not inform the police or took her mother to hospital. The\nnatural conduct of Anita (PW/5) would have been to inform the\npolice and took her mother to hospital. This unnatural conduct\nof Anita (PW/5) compel us to infer that she has reached the\nspot after the incident has taken place and assailants have left\nthe spot. In para-90, Anita (PW/5) stated that her mother was\ntaken to hospital at Sitamau. Thereafter, she was taken to\nMandsaur, she doesn&#x27;t remember that the vehicle from which\nher mother have taken to Mandsaur was driven by accused\nSanjay. In para-91, Anita (PW/5) says that when they reached\nat District Hospital, Mandsaur, accused Sanjay was present.\nShe doesn&#x27;t know that accused Sanjay accompanied her from\nMandsaur to Sitamau. It is very surprising that this witness was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                18</span>\n\npresent in the vehicle from which her mother was taken from\nSitamau to Mandsaur, but she don&#x27;t remember that the vehicle\nwas driven by accused Sanjay. Naurangi Bai (PW/8) had\ncategorically admitted in para-33 that the vehicle by which\nRoop Kunwar, Anita and she went from Sitamau to Mandsaur\nwas driven by accused Sanjay. Thus, in light of the statement\nof Naurangi bai (PW/8), it appears that Anita (PW/5) has\ndeliberately given a false statement that she doesn&#x27;t remember\nthat the vehicle was driven by accused Sanjay.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">31.   Anita (PW/5) in para-9 of her statement says that her\nmother contested the election against the accused Shardra\nSharma, who is the wife of accused Ramesh Chandra Sharma\nand her mother has lost the election. Thereafter, she contested\nthe election against the accused Sunil Sharma and again she\nlost the election of Parshad. She further says that on 27/10/05,\naccused Sunil, Rameshchandra, Nahar, Vinod and Pawan\nassaulted her mother by means of sword. As a result of which,\nleft hand of her mother was cut and in that criminal case\nPawan, Vinod and Nahar were convicted by life imprisonment\nand accused Sunil Sharma was absconded. In para-10, she\nfurther says that 15 days prior to the incident, quarrel took\nplace between her mother and accused Ramesh Chandra and\nRajesh, when FIR was not recorded, then they made a\ncomplaint   to    the   Human       Rights   Commission     and\nSuperintendent of Police. Prior to this incident, Ramesh\nChandra and his son Rajesh threatened her mother to kill her.\nThe report was lodged and the case is pending. In para-17, she\nfurther says that civil suit was going on with regard to the\nhouse situated at Bus Stand, Sitamau in between her mother\nand Bhawarlal. In para-19, she further says that she doesn&#x27;t\nknow that the suit was filed on behalf of Bhawarlal by accused\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                19</span>\n\nRamesh Chandra Sharma. In para-21, she says that she has\ncontested the election in the year 1999, wherein accused\nSharda Sharma was also the candidate. In para-26, she says\nthat she lodged the report against Kailash and Narsingh and\ndoesn&#x27;t remember that the case was under <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 354</a> of the\nIPC, but says that the case was of &quot;Ched-Chaad&quot;. In para-27,\nshe says that compromise has taken place between them. She\nadmitted that another report under <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 354</a> of the IPC was\nlodged by her against Shiv Singh and Gajraj Singh. She herself\nhas stated that Shiv Singh and Gajraj Singh were the friends of\naccused Sunil Sharma. She further admitted that <a href=\"/doc/137587/\" id=\"a_22\">in that case</a>,\naccused Ramesh Chandra Sharma was the defence counsel\nand accused Shivraj Singh and Gajraj Singh were acquitted <a href=\"/doc/137587/\" id=\"a_23\">in\nthat case</a>. In para-31, she says that order was passed against\naccused Ramesh Chandra Sharma in the case of 307 of the\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_24\">IPC</a> by the trial Court and the order was set aside by the High\nCourt. She has filed the SLP before the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court.\nThus, from the aforesaid statement of Anita (PW/5), it is crystal\nclear that there was the long standing enmity between the\ndeceased and accused Ramesh Chandra Sharma, Sunil son of\nR.C.Sharma, Sharda Sharma, wife of R.C.Sharma and Anju,\ndaughter of R.C.Sharma.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"137587\" id=\"span_25\">32.   Anita (PW/5) in para-35 of her statement has admitted\nthat Vinod has lodged the report against her. She herself has\nstated that she has been acquitted <a href=\"/doc/137587/\" id=\"a_25\">in that case</a>. She further\nadmitted that another report was lodged against her and her\nbrothers regarding rape. In para-113, she says that she doesn&#x27;t\nknow that on the date of incident, the shops were open from 8-\n00 a.m. She doesn&#x27;t remember that at the time of incident,\nshops adjacent to the place of occurrence were open or not.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">33.   In view of the aforesaid analysis of the statement of Anita\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                   20</span>\n\n(PW/5), it is evident that there was deep enmity between the\ndeceased, accused Ramesh Chandra Sharma and his family\nmembers. There are several contradictions and omissions on\nthe material points. The conduct of Anita (PW/5) during incident\nand after incident has also been found unnatural. Anita (PW/5)\nhas improved her version before the Court. Further Anita\n(PW/5) has avoided the answers on vital questions saying that\nshe doesn&#x27;t remember. The statement of Anita (PW/5) is also\nnot in consonance with the statement of eye witness Naurangi\nBai (PW/8) on the vital points.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">34.   The prosecution has not examined Palladi Bai, who is\nnamed as eye witness in the report (Ex.P/3). No explanation\nwhat so ever has been furnished by the prosecution in non-\nexamination of such material witness. Anita (PW/5) in her\nstatement has categorically admitted in para-117 that there is\nresidential house, wherein persons are residing and there are\nalso shops around the place of incident. Despite this,\nprosecution has not examined any witness. Considering that\nthere was deep enmity between the deceased and the accused\nRamesh Chandra Sharma and his family members. It was\nnecessary for the prosecution to examine the witnesses, who\nare residing and having the shops around the place of\noccurrence because the incident alleged to have been taken\nplace at 11-30 a.m. But none have been examined and no\nexplanation has been furnished by the prosecution regarding\nnon examination of such witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">35.   Dehati Nalishi (Ex.P/3) has been lodged by Anita (PW/5)\nand it has been recorded by O.K.Singh (PW/12). This witness\nhas stated in para-2 that wrong date has been mentioned\nwhich has been corrected by him and the same is marked as D\nto D and E to E in Ex.P/3 and he made his initials. In para-17,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                21</span>\n\nhe has stated that in the column of place of incident, date and\ntime, he has mentioned &quot;17/06/09 at 2-00 p.m. near old Court&quot;.\nIn the column of information of date and time, he has\nmentioned &quot;17/06/09 at 2-20 P.M&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">36.   According to O.K.Singh (PW/12), Dehati Nalishi was\nrecorded at 2-20 P.M. and time of the incident has been\nmentioned as 2-00 P.M. Doctor Bhupendra Jain (PW/1) says\nthat on 17/06/09, he was posted as Medical Officer at\nCommunity Health Centre, Sitamau. Roop Kunwar W/o\nShambhu Singh was brought to Community Health Centre,\nSitamou. She was brought near about 2-00 P.M., he examined\nher and at about 2-05 P.M., he referred her for further treatment\nto Civil Hospital, Mandsaur. He gave his report Ex.P/1 which\nbears his signature marked as A to A. Doctor Pradeep Sharma\n(PW/6) stated that on 17/06/09, he was posted as Senior\nMedical Officer at District Hospital, Mandsaur. Roop Kunwar\nw/o Shambhu Singh was referred from Community Health\nCentre, Sitamou and was brought before him. He found her\ndead. He informed the SHO, Mandsaur vide Ex. P/10 which\nbears his signature and marked as A to A.

In para-7, he has admitted that in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                22</span>\n\nEx.P/9, the date and time of death of the deceased has been\nmentioned as &quot;17/06/09 at 1-00 P.M.&quot; According to him this\ntime has been mentioned on the basis of information given by\nthe Panch witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">38.   According to Anita (PW/5), the incident took place at\nabout 1-30 P.M., but in her report, the time of the incident has\nbeen mentioned as 2-00 P.M. while doctor Bhupendra Jain\n(PW/1) says that the injured Roop Kunwar was brought at 2-00\nP.M. and he referred her to District Hospital, Mandsaur at 2-05\nP.M. According to doctor Pradeep Sharma, Rook Kunwar was\nbrought before him at 2-25 P.M. He written the report Ex. P/10\nat 2-25 P.M. In para-5, he has admitted that he has taken 5-10\nminutes in examining the deceased. It means that deceased\nwas brought before this witness at about 2-15 P.M. or 2-20 P.M.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">39.   The distance of the Sitamau to Mandsaur is about 55\nk.m. If it is assumed that injured was referred from Sitamou to\nMandsaur by doctor Bhupendra Jain (PW/1) at 2-05 P.M.,it\nmust take atleast one and half hour to reach District Hospital,\nMandsaur by vehicle, but according to doctor Pradeep Sharma,\ndeceased was brought before him at 2-15 to 2-20 P.M.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">40.   Thus, there is material variation regarding the time of\noccurrence of the incident, examination of the injured at\nSitamou Hospital and examination at District Hospital,\nMandsaur as well as the time mentioned in the report (Ex.P/9)\ncreates doubt regarding the time of the incident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">41.   B.L.Avasya (PW/17), who is investigating officer in para-\n43 has admitted that there are residential houses and shops\nnear the place of occurrence.

In para 25\nhe also admitted that Virendra Singh has told that Ramesh\nChandra Sharma came with his wife in the Court. Gajendra\nSingh Rathore, Krishna Ballabh Sethia also stated that the\nsame.

In para 51, this witness has admitted that\nShivnarayan and Vinod also stated that some unknown person\nfired shot. He admit that statement of aforesaid witnesses\nhave not been filed because they were not supporting the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                 25</span>\n\nprosecution case. In para 12, this witness admit that shop of\nRajesh, Ishwar and Arvind are around the place of occurrence.\nThus, the statements of T.R. Suryawanshi (PW/13) and\nB.L.Awasya (PW/17) casts a serious doubt about fare\ninvestigation of the case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">45.   The prosecution has failed to prove the compliance of\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 157</a> of Cr.P.C. Ex.P/32 is the receipt of\ncounter FIR, it reveals that it has been received on 18/06/2009\nat 11.00 AM by the concerning Magistrate. B.L. Awasiya\n(PW/17) in para 50 and 52 has stated that distance of Court of\nJMFC, Sitamau from Police Station, Sitamau is 300 meter. He\nfurther says that the residence of JMFC, Sitamau is also\nsituated in the Court campus.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">46.   As noticed earlier doctor Bhupendra Jain (PW/1)\nreferred Roopkunwar for further treatment to District Hospital,\nSitamau at 02.05 PM. The distance of Sitamau to Mandsaur is\nabout 55 kms. Doctor Pradeep Sharma (PW/6) examined\nRoopkunwar at Mandsaur and given his report Ex.P/10 at\n02.25 PM. According to Anita (PW/5) incident took place at\n01.30 PM. In the report Ex.P/3 time of incident has been\nmentioned 02.00 PM. There is over writing in Dehati Nalishi\nEx.P/3 with regard to time and date. T.R. Suryawanshi\n(PW/13) and B.L. Awasiya (PW/17) in their cross-examination\nhave categorically admitted that shopkeepers and residents\nwere around the place of incident and further stated that two\nNakab Posh persons fired shot at the deceased. Bhupendra\nJain (PW/1) as well as eye-witness Naurangibai (PW/8)\ncategorically stated that Roopkunwar was taken from Sitamau\nto Mandsaur Hospital on a Jeep which was driven by\naccused/Sanjay. The conduct of Anita (PW/5) and Naurangibai\n(PW/8) have been found un-natural. There are no many\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                    26</span>\n\n     contradictions and omissions on the vital points. There is a\n     deep    previous    enmity   between     the   deceased     and\n     appellant/Ramesh Chandra Sharma and his family members.\n     The prosecution has not examined any independent witness,\n     though the incident taken in a busy place surrounded by\n     various shops and residence. In our considered opinion, the\n     testimony of Anita (PW/5) and Naurangibai (PW/8) cannot be\n     held to be trustworthy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">     47.    The delay of about 21 hours in dispatching FIR to\n     Magistrate while the Court is only about 300 meter away from\n     police station and variation of time noted above along with\n     interpolation in Dehati Nalisi coupled with the statement of\n     Anita (PW/5) and Rajesh that report was lodged at Mandsaur\n     casts a serious doubt regarding the time of recording Dehati\n     Nalisi (Ex.P/3). [Thandedar Singh Vs. State of M.P. (2004) 1\n     SCC 487 relied on].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">     48.    In view of the aforesaid analysis, in our opinion, the\n     prosecution has miserably failed to prove the charges against\n     the appellants. Criminal Appeal Nos. 397/11 &amp; 456/11\n     deserves to be allowed and Criminal Appeal No. 371/15 is\n     liable to be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">     49.    Consequently, criminal Appeal Nos. 397/11 and 456/11\n     are allowed and the conviction of the appellants Narendra\n     Kumar, Rameshchandra Sharma and Sunil Sharma under\n     <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_28\">Sections 302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_29\">120-B</a> and <a href=\"/doc/81396/\" id=\"a_30\">120-B(1)</a> of the IPC is hereby set\n     aside. Appellants are acquitted from the aforesaid charges.\n     The amount of fine, if deposited, be refunded to the appellants.\n     Criminal Appeal No. 371/15 is sans merits and is hereby\n     dismissed.\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">               (P.K.Jaiswal)                         (D.K.Paliwal)\nsk                 Judge                                Judge\n </pre>","numcites":17,"numcitedby":82,"docsource":"Madhya Pradesh High Court","citetid":78532972,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"interested witness","formInput":"interested%20witness"},{"value":"previous enmity]","formInput":"previous%20enmity%5D"},{"value":"interested witnesses","formInput":"interested%20witnesses"},{"value":"case diary","formInput":"case%20diary"},{"value":"mandsaur","formInput":"mandsaur"},{"value":"no independent witness","formInput":"no%20independent%20witness"},{"value":"ramesh chandra sharma","formInput":"ramesh%20chandra%20sharma"},{"value":"Gun shot","formInput":"Gun%20shot"},{"value":"Bandages","formInput":"Bandages"},{"value":"sec 120-b","formInput":"sec%20120-b"},{"value":"\"interested witness\"","formInput":"%22interested%20witness%22"},{"value":"unnatural","formInput":"unnatural"},{"value":"Gajraj Singh ","formInput":"Gajraj%20Singh%20"},{"value":"397","formInput":"397"},{"value":"dairy","formInput":"dairy"},{"value":"120-b","formInput":"120-b"},{"value":"\"material facts\"","formInput":"%22material%20facts%22"},{"value":" material facts","formInput":"%20material%20facts"}],"cats":[{"value":"murder","formInput":"tag:murder"},{"value":"indian-penal-code","formInput":"tag:indian-penal-code"},{"value":"rioting","formInput":"tag:rioting"},{"value":"unlawful-assembly","formInput":"tag:unlawful-assembly"},{"value":"assault-on-woman","formInput":"tag:assault-on-woman"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
