Harbhej\nSingh (A-3)  and Gurmej Singh (A-4), the respondents herein,\nare the\t real brothers\twheres Sohan  Singh (A-5)  and Mohan\nSingh (A-6),  the respondents herein, are the real brothers.\nThe house  of Harbhej  Singh (A-1) is situated adjoining the\nhouse of Hardev Singh (P.W.2). Harbhej Singh (A-1) and Sohan\nSingh (A-5)  are  cousins.  Suba  Singh,  the  appellant  in\nCriminal Appeal\t No. 558  of 1988  is the  son of  Harbhajan\nSingh (since  deceased), whereas  Criminal Appeal No. 557 of\n1988 is\t filed\tby  Hardev  Singh,  the\t brother  of  Baldev\nSingh(since deceased).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(3)  It is  alleged by\tthe prosecution\t that  Hardev  Singh\n(P.W.2) was  doing some\t construction work  at his house. On\n23rd May,  1985 at about 7.30 p.m when he was sitting in his\nhouse alongwith Jaswant Singh and their father Chanan Singh,\nHarbhajan Singh\t (since deceased and Suba Singh (P.W.3) came\nto his\thouse with  a view  to help  him in the construction\nwork. At that time all the accused persons armed with deadly\nweapons reached\t the house  of Hardev Singh (P.W.2). Harbhej\nSingh (a-1)  was armed\twith a\t.12 bore  double barrel gun.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">Gurbhej Singh  (A-2) with a Gandhali, Sohan Singh (A-5) with\na Kirpan,  and Amrik  Singh (A-3),  Gurmej Singh  (A-4)\t and\nMohan Singh  (A-6) were\t carrying Gandasas  with them.\tThey\ntrespassed into\t the house  of Hardev  Singh (P.W.2)  and  a\nlalkara was  given to  teach a\tlesson to him and others for\ncausing injuries  to Harbhej  Singh (A-1).  Immediately\t all\nthese accused  persons started\tassaulting Suba Singh (PW.3)\non his\tchest. In  the meantime\t Harbhej Singh (A-1) fired a\nshot from his gun hitting on the right dorsal and the pitarm\nof Harbhajan  Singh causing  a bleeding injury upon which he\nfell down.  Amrik Singh\t (A-2) then inflicted blows from the\nsharp side  of the  gandasa on\this shoulder and right (A-3)\ngave a\tgandasa blow from its sharp side on his right thigh;\nMohan Singh (a-6) did not lag behind and also gave a gandasa\nblow on\t his right ankle. Harbhej Singh (A-1) fired one more\nshot from  his gun  but it  did not hit anybody. A roula was\nraised whereupon  all the  accused persons  fled  away\twith\ntheir weapons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">(4)  Coming to\tthe second  part of the incident of the same\ntransaction, it\t is alleged by the prosecution that when the\naccused persons\t were running  away they raised a lalkara to\nfinish Baldev  Singh. Apprehending  danger to  the  life  of\nBaldev\tSingh,\t Hardev\t Singh\t(P.W.2)\t and  Jaswant  Singh\nhurriedly went\tin the direction where Baldev Singh had gone\nto take\t fodder, to  inform him about the first incident and\nalso to\t caution him. At that point of time Baldev Singh was\ncoming back after taking fodder in the tractor trolley. When\nhe reached  in front  of the house of A-1, he was surrounded\nby the accused persons. Baldev Singh stopped the tractor and\ntried to escape from the back side of the trolley but in the\nmeantime Sohan\tSingh (A-5)  gave a kirpan blow chopping off\nhis right  arm. He  fell on  the barseen fodder lying in the\ntrolley. Harbhej Singh (A-1) raised an alarm whereupon Amrik\nSingh (A-3) climbed upon the trolley and  chopped off hi leg\nwith a\tgandasa whereas\t Gurmej Singh  (A-3) gave  two three\nblows with a gandasa on his left arm. Mohan Singh (A-6) also\ngave a gandasa blow from its sharp side on his chest. Due to\nmurderous assault  Baldev Singh\t fell in  the  trolley\twith\nbleeding injuries.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">(5)  Hardev Singh (P.W.2) then contacted Rajinder Singh, the\nSarpanch and  informed him  about the  assault on  Harbhajan\nSingh, Baldev  Singh  and  Suba\t Singh.\t The  three  injured\npersons were  then taken  to the  hospital in a trolley. The\ntwo injured  persons, namely,  Harbhajan  Singh\t and  Baldev\nSingh while  being carried  to the  hospital,  succumbed  to\ntheir injuries.\t On reaching  the hospital   at\t Mamdot, the\ndoctor on seeing the serious condition of Suba Singh (P.W.3)\nadvised that  he be  taken to  the hospital at Ferozepur for\nmedical treatment.  Hardev Singh  (P.W.2) then\twent to\t the\npolice Station,\t Mamdot and  lodged a report, Ex-PK at 10.50\np.m. on\t the  basis  of\t which\ta  formal  FIR\tEx-PK/1\t was\nrecorded. The  special report  was sent to Illaqa Magistrate\nat about 1.30 a.m. on 24.5.1985.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">(6)  SI Puran  Singh then went to the hospital at Mamdot but\nfor want  of light he could not hold the inquest on the dead\nbodies . He then went to Ferozepur hospital but there he was\ntold by the doctor that Suba Singh (P.W.3) was unfit to make\nany statement . He then returned back to civil hospital at\n(Mamdot and  held inquest  viz. Ex.PC and PF respectively on\nthe dead  bodies of Harhajan Singh and Baldev Singh and sent\nthem  to  the  Civil  Hospital,\t Ferozepur  for\t post-mortem\nexamination vide  his two  ruqqas dated\t 23.5.85 exhibits PB\nand PF.\t He thereafter went to the house of Chanan Singh and\nduring the  investigation collected blood stained earth from\nthe place  of occurrence  vide Ex.

The accused then made the\ndisclosure statements  under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_1\">Section  27</a> of the Evidence Act\nwhich led to the recovery of certain incrimination articles.\nHarbhej Singh  (A-1) an\t Mohan Singh  (A-6) were arrested on\n31.5.1985  and\tduring\tthe  investigation  they  also\tmade\ndisclosure statements  which led  to the  recovery of  a gun\nEx.P.11 along  with five cartridges Ex.P.12 to 16; a licence\nEx.P.JJ and a gandasa Ex.P.17. All these articles were taken\ninto possession\t vide Ex.P.17. All these articles were taken\ninto possession vide Ex.PKK and PLL respectively. The seized\narticles were then sent to Chemical Examiner, Serologist and\nDirector, Chandigarh  for  examination\tand  reports.  After\ncompleting the\tinvestigation all the six respondents herein\nwere charge  sheeted for  offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_2\">Sections\n148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_4\">149</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1318185/\" id=\"a_5\">449</a>,<a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_6\">324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_7\">149</a> IPC. A-1 was further charged for an\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 27</a> of the Arms Act.\n(8)  The defence  of the  accused is  that of  total denial.\nAccording to  them they\t have been falsely implicated due to\nenmity. They  also denied  to have  made any statement which\nled to\tthe  recovery  of  any\tincrimination  article.\t The\naccused pleaded that they are innocent and be acquitted. The\nprosecution in\tsupport of  its case  examined as many as 13\nwitnesses of  whom two\tare witnesses  of facts\t besides the\nformal witnesses.  The defence\talso examined Dr.H.L. Bhami,\nD.W.1, the Consulting Scientist Forensic Science Laboratory,\nChandigarh.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">(9)  The Learned  Sessions Judge, Ferozepur, on appraisal of\noral and  documentary evidence on record by his Judgment and\norder dated 20th September, 1986 convicted Harbhej Singh (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">1), Amrik  Singh (A-3),\t Gurmej Singh  (A-4) and Sohan Singh\n(A-5) on  three counts viz. (i)449 IPC; (ii) 302/34 IPC; and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">(iii)324/34 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_9\">IPC</a>\t and   sentenced each one of them to undergo\nrigorous imprisonment  for five\t years on  first count; life\nimprisonment and  to pay  a fine  of Rs.1000/- in default of\npayment of fine to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for\nthree  months\ton  second  count  for\tcausing\t murders  of\nHarbhajan Singh\t and Baldev Singh; and rigorous imprisonment\nfor one year for causing injuries to Suba Singh on the third\ncount. Harbhej Singh (A-1) was convicted under <a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 27</a> of\nthe  Arms   Act\t and   was  sentenced\tto  suffer  rigorous\nimprisonment for  one year.  All substantive  sentences were\ndirected to run concurrently. While acquitting Gurbhej Singh\n(A-2) and Mohan Singh (A-6) learned Sessions Judge held that\nthe role  attributed to both of them was very minor inasmuch\nas A-2 alleged\tto have caused a simple injury to Suba Singh\n(P.W.3) and  no overtact  was attributed to him . As regards\nMohan Singh  (A-6), he\tfound that he alleged to have caused\none injury on non-vital part of the body Harbhajan Singh and\none dimple  injury to  Baldev Singh.  The injuries caused by\nboth these  accused could  have been caused to them by other\nco-accused.  No\t  motive  was\talleged\t against  them\tand,\ntherefore, their false implication cannot be ruled out.\n(10) The four convicted accused(A-1), (A-3), (A-4) and (A-5)\naggrieved by  the judgment and order of conviction preferred\na Criminal  Appeal No.553  DB/86 whereas the State of Punjab\npreferred a  Criminal Appeal  No.198-DBA/87 against  the two\nacquitted accused  (A-2) and  (A-6) to the High Court . Both\nthe criminal  appeals were  heard together  by the  Division\nBench of  the High  Court and  the learned Division Bench by\nits  judgment\tand  order  dated  January  28,1988  allowed\nCriminal Appeal\t No. 553  DB/86 filed by the State of Punjab\ncame to\t be dismissed confirming the order of acquitted them\nall .  The appeal  filed by  the state\tof Punjab came to be\ndismissed  confirming  the  order  of  acquittal.  Appellant\nHardev Singh,  the brother of Baldev Singh (since deceased )\non obtaining  Special Leave has filed Criminal Appeal No.558\nof 1988\t whereas Criminal Appeal No. 558 of 1988 is filed by\nSuba Singh,  the son of Harbhajan Singh (since deceased ) in\nthis   Court. Since impugned judgment is  common, both these\ncriminal appeals are being disposed of by this Judgment.\n(11) Mr. R.L.  Kohli and  Mr. Som  Datta, the Learned Senior\nCounsel appearing  in support  of these two criminal appeals\nassailed the  impugned Judgement  on various grounds. It was\ncontended that the High Court had totally misread the direct\nevidence and other materials on record. The reasoning of the\nHigh Court while acquitting the accused is based on surmises\nand conjectures\t and, therefore, it is unsustainable. It was\nurged that  the evidence  on record clearly establishes that\nHarbhajan Singh\t was assaulted\tin front  of  the  house  of\nChanan Singh.  This fact  finds corroboration  from  various\ncircumstances. No sustainable reasons were given by the High\nCourt while  rejection the  evidence of Hardev Singh (P.W.2)\nand the\t injured witness  Suba Singh  (P.W.3). It  was\tthen\ncontended  that\t  the  incident\t  in  question\toccurred  on\n23.5.1985 at  7.30 p.m. and the First Information Report was\nlodged at  the earliest\t opportunity at\t 10.50 p.m. and copy\nthereof reached Illaqa Magistrate at 1.30 a.m. on 24.5.1985.\nThe High  Court was  wholly wrong  in holding that there was\ndelay in  lodging the First Information Report. Both the eye\nwitnesses were\tdisbelieved on\tflimsy ground that they were\nunable to  explain the\tsecond fire  arm injury on Harbhajan\nSingh. It was then submitted that the learned Sessions Judge\nwas equally  wrong in acquitting A-2 and A-6 which order was\nconfirmed by the High Court. There is unimpeachable material\non record  to prove  that they\twere members  of an unlawful\nassembly having\t a common object to lay murderous assault on\nthe victims.  The trial\t court as  also the  High Court\t had\ncompletely misread the scope and true meaning of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_11\">section 149</a>\nIPC . The High Court ought to have allowed  the appeal filed\nby the State of Punjab against the order of acquittal of A-2\nand A-6 and they should have been convicted for the offences\nfor the offences for which they were charge sheeted. Learned\nCounsel, therefore,  urged that\t the appeals  be allowed and\nthe respondents\t accused be  dealt with\t in accordance\twith\nlaw.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">(12) It may  be stated that the State of Punjab did not file\nany appeal  in this  Court against  the\t impugned  order  of\nacquittal passed by the High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_13\">(13) Mr. R.S  Sodhi, the Learned Counsel for the respondents\n(accused )  supported the impugned judgment of acquittal. He\nurged that  the view  taken by\tthe High Court is a probable\none and,  therefore, no interference is called for. Both the\nappeals are devoid of any merit and be dismissed.\n(14) We have  given our\t careful thought  to the contentions\nraised before us. With a view to determine as to whether the\nview taken  by the  High Court\tis  probable  one,  we\thave\ncarefully gone\tthrough the  evidence and other materials on\nrecord. We  may briefly\t indicate the  reasons for acquittal\ngiven by the High Court an under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(i)  Delay in  lodging the FIR.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(ii) Non examination of independent witnesses of facts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(iii) If  P.W.2 and  P.W.3  were  present  at  the  time  of\n     incident it  would be  unbelievable that they would not\n     have intervened to protect the victims.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(iv) When the  assailants went\tto attack  Baldev Singh, his\n     relatives including  eye  witnesses  did  not  go\twith\n     weapons to\t protect him; a situation which according to\n     the High  Court &quot;it is not so easily acceptable in real\n     life&quot;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(v)  The witnesses  could not have identified the assailants\n     since it  was a dark night hence it was a case of blind\n     murders.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(vi) The deceased  were men  of desparate  character and had\n     many enemies  and the  respondents (accused) were named\n     as culprits primarily on suspicion.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(viii)\t  DDR entry  34 dated 23.5.1985 did not disclose the\n\t  names of eye witnesses, place of occurrence or the\n\t  weapons.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(ix) Medical evidence  does not\t support the  ocular account\n     since injury  No.6 found  on the dead body of Harbhajan\n     Sigh remained wholly unexplained.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(x)  The victim\t (Harbhajan Singh)  must have  been fired at\n     from a very close range and not from the distance of 25\n     ft. as shown in the site plan.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">(15) After going  through  the\tocular\tevidence  and  other\nmaterials on record we are of the considered view that every\nfinding recorded  by the  High Court  is patently  wrong and\nunsustainable. The  High Court\thas completely\tmisread\t the\nveidence on record.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">(16) Coming to the finding as regards the non-examination of\nindependent eye\t witnesses who\tsaw the incident in question\nwe must\t hasten to  add that  it is  complete erroneous\t and\nunmerited  .  The  prosecution\thas  examined  Hardev  Singh\n(P.W.2) and  an injured witness Suba Singh (P.W.3), although\nsome other  villagers did  come at the place of incident but\nin our\topinion merely\tbecause other  independent witnesses\nwere not  examined could  not be  a ground  to discredit the\nevidence of  these two\teye witnesses.\tThis Court  time and\nagain has  emphasised that  the evidence  of close relations\nwho testified  the facts  relating to  the occurrence be not\nrejected merely\t on the\t ground that they happened to be the\nrelatives. All\tthat  this  Court  has\truled  is  that\t the\nevidence of such witnesses be scrutinised very carefully. We\nhave very  carefully gone  through the\tevidence  of  Hardev\nSingh (P.W.2)  and Suba Singh (P.W.3) who were consistent in\ntheir evidence\tas regards  the details of assault caused by\nthe respondents\t (accused). Both  the witnesses\t have  given\nminute details\tin regard to the weapons used by each of the\naccused\t and   the  manner  in\twhich  they  have  assaulted\nHarbhajan Singh\t in front of the house of Chanan Singh. They\nalso stated  that A-1  fired from his gun at Harbhajan Singh\ncausing him  bleeding injuries. They further stated that the\nsecond shot  fired by A-1 missed the target. It is true that\nthe medical evidence does indicate two gun shot injuries. In\nthe facts  and circumstances  of the case non explanation of\nthe gun\t shot injury  No.6 by  these two eye witnesses would\nneither dilute\ttheir evidence\tnor their  presence could be\ndoubted. It  is the positive case of both the witnesses that\nHarbhajan Singh\t had come  the house of Chanan Singh to help\nhim in\tthe construction  work. There  is nothing  in  their\nevidence which\t can  persuade us  to disbelieve  the  story\nnarrated as  regards the assault on Harbhajan  Singh. Coming\nto the\tassault on  Baldev Singh  caused by  the respondents\n(accused), Hardev  Singh (P.W.2)  and Suba Singh (P.W.3) had\nstated that  Baldeb Singh,  on noticing that the respondents\n(accused) were\tcoming towards\thim, left  the driver&#x27;s seat\nand went  to the trolley to escape himself from the probable\nattack by  the accused.\t Harbhej Singh\t(A-1) gave a lalkara\nand thereupon  Amrik Singh  (A-3) climbed up the trolley and\nchopped off  the leg  of Baldev\t Singh with  gandasa. Gurmej\nSingh(A-4) also climbed up the trolley and gave 2-3 blows on\nhis left arm from the sharp side of gandasa. Mohan Singh (A-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">5) also\t gave a\t gandasa blow  from the\t sharp side  on\t his\nchest. After infliction injuries to Baldev Singh the accused\nfled away.  Both  these\t witnesses  were  searchingly  cross\nexamined by  the defence  but there  is hardly\tany material\nbrought on  record to discredit their evidence. The evidence\nof both\t these witnesses in our considered view unmistakably\nproves that  the respondents  (accused) who were the members\nof the unlawful assembly having a common object to cause the\nmurders of  Harbhajan Singh  and Baldev Singh did cause such\nbodily injuries\t to them  as a\tresult thereof they met with\nhomicidal deaths.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(17) The evidence of both these witnesses find corroboration\nfrom the  fact that  the blood stained earth seized from the\nfirst site of occurrence contained the human blood. In these\ncircumstances  we   have  no   manner  of   doubt  that\t the\nrespondents (accused)  formed an  unlawful assembly  and its\nobject was to cause murderous assault on Harbhajan Singh and\nBaldev Singh.  Both the\t witnesses have\t also testified that\nthe respondents\t (accused) came together with deadly weapons\nin their hands with the common object to cause such assault.\n(18) Coming to\tthe  next  ground  of  acquittal  viz.,\t non\nintervention of\t the relatives of the deceased including the\neye witnesses  during the  assault on the victims to protect\nthem, In  our opinion  is wholly  unsustainable.  Since\t the\nrespondents (accused  ) were  armed with  deadly weapons  as\nagainst this  the victims  and his  relatives  were  totally\nunarmed and  in such a situation it was absurd to expect any\nintervention and  if they were to do so it would have led to\nsome more  casualities. We,  therefore, do not see any merit\nwhatsoever in  the reasoning given by the High Court in this\nbehalf.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">(19) The High Court was totally wrong in recording a finding\nthat it\t was   a blind\tmurder during  the dark\t night.\t The\nincident took  place at 7.30 p.m on 23rd  May , 1985 and the\nwitnesses have\temphatically asserted  that there was enough\nlight\tto    identify\t  the\t accused.    Moreover\t the\nrespondents(accused) were  known to  the eye witnesses since\ntheir houses  were adjacent  to the  house of  Chanan Singh.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_14\">This finding,  therefore , is totally imaginary without\t any\nmaterial on record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">(20) The next  finding of  the High  Court that the deceased\nwere  desparate\t  criminals  having  many  enemies  and\t the\nrespondents (accused)  were roped  in on  mere suspicion  is\nagain  unsustainable.\tExcept\tthe   ipse  dixit    of\t the\nrespondents there  is  no  material  brought  on  record  to\nsupport this  assertion. This  finding of  the High Court is\nbased on evidence and thus illegal and\n(21) The further  ground in support of acquittal recorded by\nthe High  Court that  the  case\t against  the\t respondents\n(accused) was  framed in  the village with the connivance of\nthe of\tthe police,  is based on mere surmise. The very fact\nthat the FIR was lodged within three hours of the occurrence\nnaming the  accused with all details unmistakably proved the\ninvolvement of\tthe accused in the present crime. Therefore,\nthis ground  is figment\t of imagination\t on the\t part of the\nHigh Court.  There was\thardly any time to concoct any false\nstory against the respondents(accused).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">(22) The High  Court had  again committed  a grave  error in\nrelying upon  the   DDR entry  No.34 dated  23rd  May,\t1985\nwherein the  names of the eye witnesses, place of occurrence\nand the weapons of offence were not mentioned to corroborate\nthe FIR and ocular evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">(23) The finding  of the  High Court that A-1must have fired\nfrom a\tclose range  and not  from a  distance of  25 ft. as\ndeposed to by Hardev Singh (P.W.2) and Suba Singh (P.W.3) is\nnot correct. To sustain this reasoning the High Court relied\nupon the evidence of Dr. Maan (P.W.1) In a sudden assault of\nthis nature  it was difficult for an eye witness to describe\nthe correct  distance from  where the  gun was\tfired . This\nminor discrepancy  in  our  opinion  would  not\t justify  to\ndisbelieve the two eye witnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">(24) Coming to the injuries inflicted on Suba Singh (P.W.3),\nwho had\t stated in  his evidence  that he  had sustained the\ninjuries on  his person\t during the  assault caused  by\t the\nrespondents (accused),\tit  need  be  noticed  that  he\t was\ntreated\t at   Ferozepur\t  Hospital.   His   evidence   finds\ncorroboration from  the evidence  of Dr.  A.S. Mann  (P.W.1)\nMedical Officer,  Civil Hospital, Ferozepur who Testified to\nthese injuries.\t It is\ttrue that the same were superficial.\nThe evidence of Suba Singh also finds corroboration from the\nevidence of  Hardev Singh  (P.W.3). In view of this evidence\nwe see\tno hesitation  to conclude  that the respondents who\nwere members of an unlawful assembly caused injuries to Suba\nSingh and  committed an\t offence punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_12\">Sections\n324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_13\">149</a> IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">(25) The defence  has examined\tDr. H.L.  Bahmi (D.W.1)\t who\nclaims to be the Consulting Forensic Scientist New Delhi. We\nhave gone  through the\tevidence and the same in our opinion\nis tailor  made to suit the defence. After going through the\nreports of the Chemical Examiner Ex. PNN and the FSL EX. PQQ\nproduced by  the prosecution  and the  evidence of  Dr.\t H.L\nBahmi (D.W.1)  we are  satisfied that  the  reports  of\t the\nChemical Examiner  and FSL  are more  credible and we accept\nthe same and reject the evidence of Dr. H.L. Bahmi\n(26) It also  needs to\tbe mentioned  that the learned trial\njudge in  paragraph 44\tof  his\t judgment  has\treferred  to\nvarious\t recoveries   at  the\tinstance  of   some  of\t the\nrespondents and\t in particular\trecovery  of  .12  bore\t gun\n(Ex.P.11) from Harbhej Singh (A-1). The trial court accepted\nthe prosecution\t evidence in respect of these recoveries and\nheld that these various recoveries corroborated the evidence\nof two\teye witnesses.\tSurprisingly, the High Court had not\ntouched Thess  evidence at  all which  in our  opinion is  a\nserious error on its part. We accept the evidence of various\nrecoveries made during the course of investigation, which in\nunmistakable terms,  corroborates the  evidence of  two\t eye\nwitnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">(27) Coming to\tthe acquittal  of accused Nos.2 and 6 by the\ntrial court  against which  the State of Punjab had filed an\nappeal to the High Court and the same was dismissed - in our\nopinion\t the   learned\t Sessions   Judge   had\t  completely\nmisunderstood the  scope of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 149</a> IPC. The only reason\ngiven by  the learned  trial Judge  was that  there  was  no\nmaterial on the record to prove that they caused any serious\ninjuries to the two victims. It was further observed that no\nspecific role  was attributed  to these\t two accused. in our\nopinion this  finding is  again contrary  to the evidence on\nrecord inasmuch\t as both  these accused\t were the members of\nthe unlawful  assembly and  did have the common object as it\nwas implicit in their action i.e they were armed with deadly\nweapons; came  along with  other accused and participated in\nthe murderous  assault on  both the victims, The trial court\nand the\t High Court  had erred\tin law\tin not\tholding both\nthese accused guilty with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 149</a> IPC for the\nsubstantive offences  punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 302</a> IPC . The\norder of  acquittal passed  by the trial court and on appeal\naffirmed by  the High Court thus cannot be sustained for the\nreasons recorded hereinabove.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">(28) In the  result the\t Criminal Appeal  No.558 of  1988 is\nallowed. The  order of\tacquittal passed  by the trial court\nand affirmed  by the High Court in respect of A-2 and A-6 is\nquashed and  set aside. The order of acquittal passed by the\nHigh Court  in respect\tof Harbhej Singh (A-1), Amrik Singh)\n(A-3), Gurmej  (A-4) and  Sohan Singh  (A-1) in also quashed\nand set\t aside and  all the  respondents (A-1)\tto (A-6) are\nheld  guilty  for  the\toffence\t punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_17\">Sections\n302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_18\">149</a> of  the Indian Penal Code for committing the murders\nof Harbhajan  Singh and Baldev Singh and each one of them is\nsentenced to  suffer imprisonment for life on two counts and\nto pay\ta fine of Rs.1000/- each in default further rigorous\nimprisonment for  three months.
