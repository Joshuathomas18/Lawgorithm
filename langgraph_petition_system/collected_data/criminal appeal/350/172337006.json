No contradictory\n\nsuggestion was given to Dr. Rameshwar Vimlesh (PW-5).\n\nLooking to the size of the injury caused to the deceased\n\nShakuntala it could not be caused by herself and even it could\n\nnot be caused in an accident inside the house and therefore\n\nlooking to that injury the death of the deceased Shakuntala was\n\nhomicidal in nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">(9)   Ranjana @ Laxmi (PW-1) is a star witness in the case who\n\nhas stated about the incident that the culprits came from the\n\nroof of the house and held her and her mother Shakuntala\n\ndemanding the ornaments.

State of M.P.\n\nRanjana @ Laxmi could save herself in a spur of moment when\n\nthe culprits were disturbed due to bark of a bitch and she went\n\ninside the room and closed the doors of that room. Thereafter,\n\nshe could see the incident from the window of that room. The\n\nevidence given by Ranjana @ Laxmi (PW-1) and these witnesses\n\nis duly corroborated by the timely lodged FIR Ex.P-2 and post\n\nmortem report Ex.P-6 provided by Dr.Rameshwar Vimlesh (PW-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">5). Also the robbed golden ornament which was found with the\n\nappellant Monu @ Haribabu and Chandu @ Chandrabhan and\n\nwhich was duly identified by Ranjana @ Laxmi (PW-1) and\n\nRamgopal @ Gopal Prasad Sharma (PW-2) before the Ward\n\nMember Shri Laxman (PW-9). However, the learned counsel for\n\nthe appellants has submitted that there are some discrepancies\n\nin the statement of witness Ranjana @ Laxmi (PW-1) and\n\ntherefore she should be disbelieved. According to him, it was\n\nnot mentioned in the FIR Ex.P-2 that the witness Ranjana @\n\nLaxmi (PW-1) was also robbed and thereafter she went inside\n\nthe room. It would be apparent from the evidence that Ranjana\n\nmade a phone call to a neighbouring shop-keeping of her father\n\nabout the incident and therefore Ramgopal @ Gopal Prasad\n\nSharma (PW-2) and his son Manoj Sharma (PW-3) could come to\n\nthe spot. The story of that telephone call was properly\n\nmentioned in the FIR, Ex.P-2, and therefore if the witness\n                          8                  Criminal Appeal No.168/2007\n                      Narendra @ Chunna Kirar and other Vs.

State of M.P.\n\nRanjana @ Laxmi (PW-1) was not present at the spot and she\n\ncould not have saved herself by closing the room then she could\n\nnot make any phone call to the neighbouring shopkeeper of her\n\nfather. In FIR Ex.P-2 is clearly mentioned that Ranjana @ Laxmi\n\n(PW-1) would be the person who shall inform about the articles\n\nrobbed by the culprits. When the complainant Ramgopal @\n\nGopal Prasad Sharma came to the spot, he saw the incident and\n\nwhen he saw that his wife was killed he had no option except to\n\nimmediately rush to the police station and to lodge an FIR and\n\ntherefore it appears that without getting any description from\n\nRanjana @ Laxmi, the FIR was lodged and therefore if the story\n\nrelating to robbery   of the victim Ranjana @ Laxmi was not\n\nmentioned in the FIR then it makes no difference.\n\n(10) The learned counsel for the appellants has also submitted\n\nthat there is a contradiction between the statements of various\n\nwitnesses, namely, Ramgopal @ Gopal Prasad Sharma (PW-2),\n\nManoj Sharma (PW-3), Sanjay Pathak (PW-6) and Suresh (PW-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">11) and victim Ranjana @ Laxmi (PW-1).

But in the FIR, four persons were named and\n\nno unknown person was mentioned who was involved in the\n\ncrime.

In this connection, the judgment passed by\n\nthe Apex Court in the case of Ugra Ahir Vs. State of Bihar\n\n[AIR 1965 SC 277] may be referred in which it is held that\n\nthere is no witness who had not stated any falsehood. However,\n\nthe doctrine of &quot;Falsus in uno Falsus in omnibus&quot; is not\n\napplicable in our country. It is the duty of the court to pick up\n\nthe grains of truth from the chaff of the falsehood and if it is not\n\npossible to do so then the court is not permitted to create a new\n\nstory on its own. Under these circumstances, by such material\n\ndiscrepancy between the statements of other witnesses and\n\nRanjana @ Laxmi (PW-1) and evidence of Ranjana @ Laxmi\n\n(PW-1) with FIR Ex.P-2, it may be presumed that there was no\n\nfifth person who participated in the crime but testimony of\n\nRanjana @ Laxmi (PW-1) cannot be discarded against present\n\nfour appellants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">                         14                 Criminal Appeal No.168/2007\n                     Narendra @ Chunna Kirar and other Vs.

A little portion of\n\npara 11 of the aforesaid judgment is hereby reproduced as\n\nunder:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">       &quot;11. The ingredients of both these offences, to some\n       extent, are also different inasmuch as to complete an\n       offence of `dacoity&#x27; under <a href=\"/doc/958439/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 396</a> IPC, five or\n       more persons must conjointly commit the robbery\n       while under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 302</a> of the IPC even one person\n       by himself can commit the offence of murder. But, as\n       already noticed, to attract the provisions of Section\n       396, the offence of `dacoity&#x27; must be coupled with\n       murder. In other words, the ingredients of Section\n       302 become an integral part of the offences\n       punishable under <a href=\"/doc/958439/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 396</a> of the IPC.\n       Resultantly, the distinction with regard to the\n       number of persons involved in the commission of the\n       crime loses its significance as it is possible that the\n       offence of `dacoity&#x27; may not be proved but still the\n       offence of murder could be established, like in the\n       present case.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">(20)   In the light of the aforesaid judgments, if the facts of this\n\ncase are considered then it would be apparent that the\n\nappellants Narendra @ Chunna Kirar, Chandu @ Chandrabhan\n\nand Monu @ Haribabu were involved in committing the crime\n\nof murder. It is true that there was a single injury caused to the\n\nvictim and it is not very much clear that who caused that injury\n\nout of all the three culprits but out of all the appellants\n\nappellants Narendra @ Chunna Kirar, Chandu @ Chandrabhan\n\nand Monu @ Haribabu were inside the house. Hence, out of\n\nthree persons one had killed the deceased Shakuntala. It would\n                          19                 Criminal Appeal No.168/2007\n                      Narendra @ Chunna Kirar and other Vs.

State of M.P.\n\nbe apparent from the evidence given by Ranjana @ Laxmi (PW-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">1) that when the bitch barked during the incident and she went\n\ninside the room and closed the doors of that room then the\n\nappellants directed each other to give a lesson to the bitch and\n\ntherefore   the   bitch   was    also   assaulted   by    the    dagger.\n\nThereafter, each of the appellants assaulted the deceased\n\nShakuntala and ultimately a blow of dagger was given on her\n\nthroat and she was killed. Under these circumstances, all the\n\nappellants who were present inside the house were interested\n\nto kill the deceased Shakuntala because she did not intimate\n\nthem about the precious property of Ramgopal @ Gopal Prasad\n\nSharma (PW-2) within time and crowd had gathered. Hence, all\n\nof the appellants including Narendra @ Chunna Kirar, Chandu\n\n@ Chandrabhan and Monu @ Haribabu had intended to kill the\n\ndeceased Shakuntala and therefore having a common intention\n\neach of them is liable for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 302</a> of IPC with\n\nthe help of <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 34</a> of IPC. It is apparent that when the\n\nwitnesses Ramgopal @ Gopal Prasad Sharma (PW-2) etc came\n\nto the spot they saw that the appellants were beating the\n\ndeceased Shakuntala but appellant Ballu @ Jamuna Prasad\n\nalready came out of the house and was held by the crowd and\n\ntherefore   his   absence   at    the   spot   when      the    deceased\n\nShakuntala was killed creates a doubt as to whether he\n                          20                 Criminal Appeal No.168/2007\n                      Narendra @ Chunna Kirar and other Vs.

State of M.P.\n\nintended to kill the deceased or not. Hence, appellant Ballu @\n\nJamuna Prasad cannot be convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 302</a> of IPC\n\neither directly or with the help of <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 34</a> of IPC.\n\n(21) So far as the sentence part is concerned, the trial court\n\nhas recorded a sentence of Life Imprisonment for the offence\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/958439/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 396</a> of IPC which would be the minimum\n\nsentence for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 302</a> of IPC and therefore\n\nthere would not be any requirement to reduce that sentence.\n\nWhen a person has to undergo for a life imprisonment then\n\nthere is no need to record a harsh sentence for remaining\n\noffence of dacoity. For offence under <a href=\"/doc/1865117/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 397</a> of IPC\n\nminimum sentence is prescribed hence looking to the robbery\n\ndone with the victim Ranjana @ Laxmi (PW-1) and the deceased\n\nShakuntala it would be proper to reduce the sentence of offence\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1865117/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 397</a> of IPC to its minimum limit.\n\n(22) On the basis of the aforesaid discussion, the appeal filed\n\nby the appellants is hereby partly allowed. The conviction and\n\nsentence recorded by the trial court for the offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/958439/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 396</a> of IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/170156328/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 13</a> of the MPDVPK Act is\n\nhereby set aside.
