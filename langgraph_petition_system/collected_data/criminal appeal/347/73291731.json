All these three appeals arising out of a common\njudgment and order dated 10.09.2008 passed in Sessions\nTrial No.37/2007 by Additional Sessions judge, Narsinghar\nDistrict Rajgarh, therefore, they have been heard analogously\nand are being decided by this common judgment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">2.    All the appellants of their respective appeals have been\nconvicted for the offences under Sections 364/34, 302/34,\n201 read with <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 302</a> of IPC and have been awarded 10-\n10 years rigorous imprisonment and fine of RS.5,000-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">5,000/-, life imprisonment and fine of Rs.5,000-5,000/- and\n7-7 years rigorous imprisonment and fine of Rs.5,000-\n5,000/- respectively. In default of payment of fine they have\nto further undergo 1-1 year rigorous imprisonment for each\ndefault.

Facts relevant to the present appeals in short are that\nthe deceased Shailendra S/o Ramchand Gupta was running a\nhotel at bus stand of Narsinghgarh. Some time prior to his\ndeath, he also started salvage trading alongwith Chandu @\nShaikh Chand and Akbar of Nazirabad. The agreed mode of\nthe business was that the appellant Akbar will do sale-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">          24.

A meeting was fixed between them (Chandu, Akbar\nand Shailendra) for accounts clearing on 29.11.2016. At\nabout 5 o&#x27;clock in the evening, the deceased was at his hotel,\nall the appellants came there and asked him to follow them\nand they all proceeded for the meeting, but thereafter the\ndeceased was never seen alive.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">6.   When deceased did not return home till late evening,\nhis relatives started searching him. They found his Hero\nHonda Splender motor cycle bearing Number MP-39-B-9560\nlying near Dargah of Kanya Shala Road. Suspecting some\nuntoward incident, they reported the matter to the police in\nthe night itself. The police registered a Missing Person\nReport (Exb.P/6) at 00:10 A.M. on 30/11/2006 and deployed\nASI Prem Singh Chauhan for inquiry, who recorded\nstatement of servant of hotel of the deceased Laxman and\nnephew of the deceased Umesh Gupta in the night itself, who\nrevealed that in the evening when they were with the\ndeceased at the hotel, the appellants came there and took him\nwith them assuring that they will clear the accounts of the\nbusiness and will give him his share. On this basis, the police\nregistered crime no. 480/2006<a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_4\"> u/S 363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_5\">364</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_6\">34</a> of IPC (Ex.\nP/24).\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">7.   On 30.11.2006 at 3:50 A.M. ASI Prem Singh arrested\nIqrar Khan, driver of TATA 407 bearing registration no. MP-\n06-E-0877 vide Ex.P/13A, who revealed that on 29.11.2006\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">          24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\nat 10:00 in the night Chandu alongwith co-accused Idris and\nAkbar got loaded a bag in his vehicle along with some other\nsalvage from his godown and asked him to take them\ntowards Guna. On the way, after crossing Ruthiyayi Police\nChowki, they threw the bag in Gader Ghati (a Valley),\npoured diesel and burnt it. At that time, he came to know that\nthere was some human body in the bag (Ex.P/10). He took\nthe police to the spot, from where the police recovered a\nburnt body on 01.12.2006 at 06:10 A.M., which was\nidentified by cousin Moolchand as the deceased Shailendra\n(Ex.P/1 &amp; 11).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">8.   As the spot of recovery of the dead body was under the\njurisdiction of the Police Station Dharnawada, the Police\nNarsinghgarh informed the concerned Police Station before\nrecovery of dead body, who also registered a Merg and did\nall further investigation like preparation of Panchnama Lash,\nSpot map, seizure of ash and burnt bones of the deceased,\nash of bag, a piece of silver coloured metal, burnt &amp; plain\nsoil etc. (Ex.P/3, 12, 63) and sent the brunt body for autopsy\nto the District Hospital, Guna, where on 02.12.2006 Dr. B.K.\nAthwal and Dr. Milind Bhagat examined the body and\nopined that the death was due to strangulation within a\nperiod of 2-3 days and was homicidal in nature (Ex.P/60).\nThey preserved Visera, tibia bone, skull &amp; mandible, scalp\nhair, burnt cloth &amp; Jute bag&#x27;s piece, and a metal ring snake\ndesign and handed over to the police. All these articles were\nseized by the Police Narsinghgarh vide seizure memo\nEx.P/43. The body was then sent to Medico Legal Institute,\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">          24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\nGwalior for further examination.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">9.    On 01/12/2006 at 16:50 ASI Prem Singh searched\ngodown of Chandu after breaking its lock and seized a pair\nof old used black shoes, two steel glasses, a piece of card\nboard, a piece of nylon rope having a knot at one end and cut\nmark at other end, a button in which a piece of thread was\nstuck, a working calculator having name of the deceased, a\nhalf burnt candle, blood stains from the floor and a bodkin\n(Suja) with a packthread/twine in the head hole (memos\nEx.P/8&amp;9). Officer of Scene of Crime, Mobile Unit, Rajgarh\nB.S. Thakur and Finger print Expert Anil Kumar Rai also\nvisited the godown and lifted chance finger prints found on\nthe steel glasses/tumblers (Ex.P/30). On 02/12/2006, SHO,\nPS Narsighgarh Ravindra Chabriya arrested the appellants\nand on their disclosure; seized a wallet having photograph of\nthe deceased from Chandu, a nylon rope from cut from one\nend by some sharp object, a 5 litre cane of oil and a full\nsleeves shirt with a missing button from Akbar and a Bajaj\nDiscovery motorcycle from Idris (Ex.P/13 to 21) and sent\nthem all to the FSL for forensic examination. Senior Scientist\nMs. Harsha Rai (PW/28) opined that the button found from\nthe godown of Chandu was missing button of the shirt of\nAkbar. Similarly both the pieces of ropes were found of the\nsame rope (Ex.P/55).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">10.   The Police also obtained finger prints from the\nappellants (Ex.P/27) and sent them to the expert. Expert Dr.\nAnil Kumar Rai (PW/18) compared both admitted and\ndisputed finger prints and opined that the chance finger prints\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">          24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\nfound on the steel glasses seized from the godown of Chandu\nwere of Akbar and Idris (Ex.P/30 to 41).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">11.   The Police sent the button, a piece of nylon rope and\nblood scrapped and seized from the godown of Chandu and a\nblood stained shirt, a piece of rope seized from Akbar and\nalso his blood sample. On comparison by the FSL and CFSL,\nthey all were found of the same origin (Ex.P/52&amp;55 and\nEx.D/12A). Smell of kerosene was also found present in the\nsoil and other articles recovered and seized by the police\nfrom the place of recovery of dead body (Ex.P/53).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">12.   The Police also seized photographs of the deceased and\nsent them alonwith skull with mandible to the FSL. After\ncomparing both of them, Senior Scientist of FSL Mr.\nRajkamal Shrivastav (PW/27) opined that the skull was of\nthe deceased (Ex.P/54).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">13.   The Police seized a register from the wife of the\ndeceased Anita purportedly prepared by the deceased\ncontaining some entries related to the scrap trading started by\nthe deceased with the appellants (Ex.P/5 Art./A).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">14.   An identification parade was conducted by Naib\nTahsildar N.S. Chauhan (PW/11) in which the wife of the\ndeceased Anita (PW/4) identified the ring, shoes, wallet and\ncalculator of the deceased.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">15.   After completion of the investigation, the Police filed\nthe charge-sheet. The appellants were charged, tried,\nconvicted and sentenced as stated in para-2 above.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">16.   The appellants have preferred these appeals on the\ngrounds that    the judgement and order of the learned trial\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">           24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\nCourt is contrary to the law and the facts of the case. The\nprosecution could not establish that the dead body recovered\nfrom Gader Ghati was of Shailendra Gupta. The dead body\nwas recovered in burnt condition. Its identification was not\npossible. DNA profile of parents of Shailendra did not match\nwith the DNA profile of tibia bone of the dead body\nrecovered by the police. Super imposition test of photographs\nwith the skull of the dead body recovered is also doubtful\nand unreliable. Therefore, they cannot be convicted for\ncommitting murder of Shailendra.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">17.   It is further submitted that the prosecution could not\nproduce any direct evidence. There is no eye-witness of the\nalleged incident and the case of the prosecution solely\ndepends    on    the   circumstantial    evidence      and   the\ncircumstances putforth and relied upon by the prosecution\ncould not be proved beyond reasonable doubts nor their\nchain could be established. There are material contradictions,\ndiscrepancies, exaggeration and improvements in the\nstatements of the witnesses; which have been ignored by the\nlearned trial Court. The learned trial Court has misread and\nmisappreciated the evidence produced by the prosecution.\nThe judgement is erroneous on facts as also in the law and is\nonly based on the surmises and conjectures. The learned trial\nCourt has failed to appreciate properly the legal citations\nplaced in service by the counsel for the appellants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">18.   All the main witnesses co-brother Dr. Mahendra Gupta\nPW-3, servant Lakshman PW-6, wife Anita Gupta PW-4,\nnephew Umesh Gupta PW-10 and Dharmendra PW-9 are\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">              24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\neither relatives or otherwise interested witnesses. They have\nnarrated the story contrary to each other. Their statements are\nfull of contradictions and omissions and are unbelievable.\nIndependent witnesses have not supported the case of the\nprosecution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">19.   Missing person report was registered at 00:10 hours on\n30.11.2006 and only after 10 minutes at 00:20 hours, the\npolice registered the FIR. This makes the case of the\nprosecution doubtful. Therefore, the conviction of the\nappellants is not sustainable and they are entitled for\nacquittal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">20.   Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor has supported the\nfindings of the learned trial Court and prayed for dismissal of\nthe appeals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">21.   We have considered the rival contentions of both the\nparties and have gone through the record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">22.   All the appellants have not disputed the fact that on\n29.11.2006, Shailendra Gupta @ Kallu did not return home\nin the evening. This is also not disputed that on 30.11.2006,\nthe police recovered a burnt dead body from Gader Ghati,\nNear Ruthiyai Police Out post, District Guna. Cousin of\nShailendra Gupta, Mulchand Gupta PW-1 had identified the\ndead body as of Shailendra Gupta. The grounds of\nidentification mentioned in the Identification Memo that the\ndeceased was identified by Mulchand on the basis of flat foot\nand recovery of snack designed copper ring have been\ndisputed by the appellants on the ground that the fact that\nShailendra Gupta had flat foot is not mentioned in Missing\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">          24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\nPerson Report or in any Merg intimation and recovery and\nstatements of the witnesses regarding recovery of copper ring\nare contrary to each other as Mulchand and Dhamendra\n(PW/1&amp;9) have stated that it was lying near dead body while\nit is mention in the Identification Memo and is stated by the\nASI Prem Singh PW-16 and Dr. Milind Bhagat PW-25 that it\nwas recovered from finger of the dead body. It is the\nargument of the learned counsel that this copper ring was\nimplanted by the police to establish identity, but these\ngrounds are not sufficient to discard the statement made by\nthe witnesses on oath.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">23.   Looking to the nature of the documents, it was not\nrequired or expected from the witnesses that they describe\nsuch insignificant mark of identification in the Missing\nPerson Report or Merg intimation. Considering the condition\nof the dead body, it appears that substantially there is no\ncontradiction in the statements of the witnesses and\ndifference pointed out by the leaned counsel for the\nappellants is only a difference of expression. Recovery of\ncopper ring is mentioned in the document Ex.P/1 prepared at\nthe time of recovery of the dead body. All three witnesses\nhave proved this recovery. Presence of this ring is also\nbacked by statement of Dr. Bhagat. It is highly improbable\nand unnatural that when someone is going to see a dead\nbody, he will carry something with him with intent to implant\nit to prove that the dead body is of his relative, more\nparticularly when there is no reason to claim an unknown\ndead body as dead body of his brother. Therefore, in spite of\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">            24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\nminor variation in the statements of the witnesses as claimed\nby the defence, identification of dead body cannot be\ndoubted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">24.   Apart from that the dead body was not fully brunt. It\nhas clearly come in the statements of Mulchand PW-1 and\nASI Shivbhawan Tiwari PW-20 that the dead body was half\nburnt and in their cross-examination, they clearly denied\nsuggestion of the defense that the face, arms and legs of the\ndead body were fully burnt instead they have stated that the\nface of the body was half burnt, some parts of the body were\nburnt while some parts of the body were not burnt. Except\nthe leg, all parts of the body were intact. It is mentioned in\nthe Identification Memo that Mulchand had indentify the\ndead body on the basis of features of the face also. This fact\nis unchallenged. In that condition, identification of dead\nbody by cousin of Shailendra cannot be doubted. Therefore,\nthe contention of the appellants in this regard is not\nacceptable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">25.   Even otherwise, Dr. Rajkaml Shrivastav PW-27 has\nstated that he had conducted Super Imposition Test and\nfound that skull with mandible was of Shailendra Gupta.\nThough, this test is also challenged by the appellants on the\nground that recovery of positive photographs is doubtful as\nthe fact is mentioned in the letter sent to the FSL for\nconducting Super Imposition Test even prior to their seizure\nand after sending the letter these photographs have been\nshown seized. But, this question was not raised during cross\nexamination of Dr. Shrivastav and further it is not disputed\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">          24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\nthat positive photographs and its negative with which the\nskull was compared were of Shailendra. Therefore, any\ndiscrepancy in seizure of these photographs does not make\nthe Super Imposition Test doubtful.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">26.   The appellants have raised a question regarding failure\nof DNA Test to establish identity of the dead body recovered\nfrom the Gader Ghati, but it would be suffice to say that in\nthis case, the police have tried to establish identity of the\ndead body through various mode or methods like\nidentification from relatives, Super Imposition Test and DNA\ntest etc. Failure of anyone of them does not make the other\ntest report doubtful. Even otherwise, report of Senior\nScientist Mr. B.K. Mahapatra of Central Forensic Science\nLaboratory Ex.D/12-A states that only partial DNA profile\ncould be generated from the tibia bone sent to him. It appears\nthat for this reason only, comparison was not done with the\nDNA profile of blood sample of Ramchandra and Ms. Kamla\nGupta who are the parents of the deceased. In this state, it\ncannot be said that the DNA profile of parents did not match\nwith the tibia bone of dead body recovered by the police and\nsent to the CFSL for DNA comparison. Therefore, the\nargument of the learned counsel for the appellants fails.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">27.   Thus, finding of the learned trial Court that the dead\nbody recovered by the police was of Shailendra Gupta @\nKallu is well founded and we also confirm the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">28.   As no direct evidence is available in this case, the\nprosecution depends on the circumstantial evidence. The\ncircumstance, which the prosecution could brought on record\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">             24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\ncan broadly be segregated in the following four categories:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(i)    The deceased and the appellants have started scrap\ntrading in partnership and the deceased had financed that\nbusiness.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(ii)   A meeting was fixed on 29/11/2006 in the evening for\nsettlement of accounts and distribution of profit of that\nbusiness.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(iii) The deceased was last seen alive in the company of the\nappellants.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(iv) Scientific evidence available against the appellants.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_39\">29.    Anita PW-4 has stated that before death; her husband\ntold her that he has started scrap trading in partnership of\nChandu and Akbar and 8-10 days prior to his death he has\ngiven them Rs.7-8 lacs to purchase scrap from a factory\nsituated in Gwalior. She has further stated that on the fateful\nday of the incident at about 2-3 P.M. her husband, when he\ncame for lunch as usual, informed her that Chandu and Akbar\nare coming in the evening for settlement of accounts of their\nbusiness of scrap treading. An inanimate attempt is made by\nthe appellants to challenge these facts in cross-examination\nof Anita, but in vain and all these facts have remained intact.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">30.    Anita has also stated that besides running a restaurant;\nher husband was also doing money lending and for that\npurpose he used to maintain a register of all transactions in\nhis own handwriting. The police have seized this register\nArticle-A vide seizure memo Ex.P.5 (Anita PW-4, Mulchand\nPW-2 and R.C. Pathak PW-24). These facts have also not\nbeen substantially challenged by the appellants in the cross-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">           24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\nexamination of the witnesses. Further, these are corroborated\nby register Ex.P/5 seized during investigation. In this\nregister, entries of transaction with the appellants Chandu\nand Akbar spreads in several pages, which are also\nunchallenged.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">31.   Thus, it is clear that the deceased and the appellants\nChandu and Akbar were well known to each other. The\ndeceased had invested substantial money in scrap trading and\non the date of incident, they were going to sit together for\naccounting and profit sharing and also to refund money to\nthe deceased.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">32.   Lakshman PW-6; who is undisputedly working on the\nrestaurant of the deceased as &#x27;order master&#x27; has stated that on\nthe date of incident; when he was busy with customers and\nthe deceased was sitting at the restaurant, the appellants\ncame; talked with him (the deceased) for some time and then\ntook him with them. When he did not return till 10:00 in the\nnight, he shut the restaurant, went to the house of the\ndeceased and handed over keys to his wife. As she asked\nabout the deceased, he informed that the deceased had gone\nwith the appellants and did not return thereafter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">33.   Umesh PW-10, who is nephew of the deceased and\nworks as medical representative, has stated that on the date\nof incident, he picked up a pre owned fridge purchased from\nhis another uncle Dr. Mahendra Gupta and brought it at bus\nstand to take it to his village by bus. At the bus stand, he tried\nto load the fridge in the bus scheduled to depart at 5:00 P.M.\nbut could not succeed due to shortage of space. He came\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">          24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\nback at the restaurant of the deceased as the next bus was at\n7:00 P.M. and had a chat with him for some time. The\ndeceased told him about his new business of scrap trading.\nHe also revealed that today the appellants are coming and\nthey all will sit together to complete the book keeping and\nclear the accounts. The deceased asked him to go and meet\nhis aunt (wife of the deceased). He went to his house and\ncame back at about quarter to 7:00 P.M. The deceased was\nnot there. He waited for him till about 8:00 P.M. and\nthereafter called his aunt and asked for him. His aunt\ninformed that he might have gone with Chandu as a meeting\nwas scheduled between them for book keeping of scrap\ndeals. He (Umesh) took mobile number of Chandu and called\nhim, who informed that he had seen the deceased last at\nabout 4-4:30 in the vegetable marked purchasing some\nvegetables.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">34.   Anita PW-4 has stated that when Umesh informed that\nher husband has not returned for a long time, she called\nChandu on his mobile, who replied that he had seen the\ndeceased last at about 4-4:30 in the vegetable marked\npurchasing some vegetables. When her husband did not\nreturn till 9:00 P.M., she started worrying. She called\nneighbours, Councillor Bhola and also her brother-in-law\n(husband of her sister) Dr. Mahendra Gupta and informed\nthem about the fact. Apprehending some mis-happening, they\nall started searching him, but did not find any clue. During\nthe search, Rajesh Sharma PW-14 informed them that around\n10:00 in the night, after closing his shop, when he was\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_47\">           24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\ncoming to his house, he saw the motorcycle of the deceased\nstanding on the road, but the deceased was not there. Family\nmembers of the deceased picked up the motorcycle and bring\nit at home. After this recovery, Mahendra Gupta and\nMoolchand PW-1 discussed the matter and decided to inform\nthe police.

Ravindra Chawadiya, Sub-inspector PW-7 has stated\nthat he interrogated the appellants Chandu, Akbar and Idrish\nwho revealed information regarding wallet of the deceased,\npart of nylon rope and blood stained shirt and motorcycle\nrespectively and on their pointing out, he recovered all these\narticles from their respective possession. Wallet of the\ndeceased was containing Rs.15/-, photograph of the deceased\nand 3 receipts. A button was missing from the shirt seized\nfrom the appellant Akbar.

All these witnesses remained intact and could not be\nrebutted even after lengthy cross-examination by the\nappellants and their statements are well supported and\ncorroborated     by     the   documents    prepared    during\ninvestigation. All this evidence has been discussed in detail\nby the learned trial Court and therefore, reverberation of the\nsame is not required.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">46.   When we put all this evidence together in a sequence,\nwe found that the deceased and the appellants Chandu and\nAkbar were known to each other, they have started treading\nin scrap in partnership, the deceased funded this business, on\n29.11.2006, they were going to sit together to clear the\naccounts and to share the profit and refund the money to the\ndeceased, in the evening, the appellants took the deceased\nwith them, thereafter, he was never seen alive and his dead\nbody was found near District Guna, his belongings like shoes\nand calculator were found in the godown of Chandu, his\nwallet was recovered from possession of Chandu, finger\nprints of Idrish and Akbar were found on the steel glasses\nrecovered from the godown of Chandu, missing button of the\nshirt of the appellant Akbar was recovered from the godown\nof the appellant Chandu and calculator and Shoes of the\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">          24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\ndeceased were also recovered from the same godown. All\nthese ocular as well as documentary and scientific evidence\nis more than sufficient to establish the fact that none else but\nthe appellants have caused the incident.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_64\">47.   Contentions of the counsels for the appellants are that\nall the main witnesses of the prosecution Dr. Mahendra\nGupta, Mulchand, Anita, Umesh and Lakshman and other\nwitnesses are either relative or interested witnesses, their\nstatements are full of contradictions, omissions and\nexaggerations on material points and are contrary to each\nother. The prosecution neither could establish circumstances\nrelied upon nor the chain of circumstance could be\ncompleted. Except Lakshman, no other witness Anita,\nMahendra or Umesh have stated that they have last seen the\ndeceased in the company of the appellants. Lakshaman was\nnot acquainted with the appellants and he was not taken to\nidentify them during investigation. Lakshman has stated that\nhe revealed before wife of the deceased Anita at about 10:00\nin the night that the deceased has gone with the appellants\nwhile Anita, Umesh and Mahendra all have stated that they\nhave started search for the deceased much prior to the time\nclaimed by Lakshman. All these witnesses Mahendra, Anita,\nUmesh and Lakshman have claimed that they were aware of\nthe fact that the deceased had last seen in the company of the\nappellants while in missing person report lodged in the\nmidnight at about 12:10 , this fact is not mentioned in the\nmain column prescribed for particulars of information, later,\nthe prosecution has appended this fact at the end of this\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">           24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\nreport Ex.P/6. Even, in this appended note also, it is not\nmentioned that the deceased had gone with the appellants,\nonly this is mentioned in this note that the deceased has\nrevealed before Umesh at about 4:45 P.M. in the evening that\na meeting is to be held between Chandu and him for\nsettlement of accounts. If all these witnesses were aware that\nthe deceased had gone with the appellants then there was no\nreason for them not to mention this fact in missing person\nreport. This makes their statements doubtful. The prosecution\nhas failed to prove motive for the offience. The missing\nperson report was lodge in the night at about 12:10 and just\nafter 10 minutes FIR was registered at about 12:20 in the\nnight. This shows manipulation of the police and renders its\ncase unreliable. Godown of Chandu is an open place and\naccessible to all. Evidence regarding sealing or opening the\ngodown after breaking the lock is contrary and unreliable.\nHand writing of register Article-A is not got compared by the\nprosecution, therefore, it can not be said that the register\nArticle-A was in the hand writing of the deceased.\nIndependent witnesses have not supported the case of the\nprosecution. Information given by the co-accused Ikrar in his\nstatement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act, is\nnot admissible against other appellants. The learned trial\nCourt has committed error in relying upon such memo\nstatements of co-accused. The trial Court has misread and\nmis-appreciated the evidence on record. The case of the\nprosecution is doubtful. Therefore, the appellants are entitled\nfor acquittal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">          24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">48.   All the contentions raised by the learned counsel for the\nappellants are same which were raised before the learned\ntrial Court. The learned trial Court has dealt with all theses\ncontentions in para no.40 onward of the impugned\njudgement. Reasons assigned by the learned trial court for\ndismissal of these contentions are well founded and\nsupported by the evidence oral and documentary and all the\nevidence is appreciated in correct perspective. We have re-\nappreciated them with reference to the evidence particularly\nthe scientific evidence whose impartiality, reliability and\ncredibility can not be doubted and we found that only this\nevidence alone is sufficient to reach on the conclusion which\nthe learned trial Court has arrived at. The learned trial Court\nhas appreciated all the circumstances in detail with reference\nto the contentions of the appellants, reiteration of the same is\nunnecessary as we are in consensus with the learned trial\nCourt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">49.   Conversation between Anita, Umesh and Mulchand\nappears very natural. Similarly, the conduct of Lakshman\nalso appears natural. Though there are some discrepancies in\nwords and timing, but crux of their statement that at lunch,\nthe deceased told his wife that he is going to sit with the\nappellants in the evening for settlement of accounts and he\nrevealed the same fact before Umesh remained the same.\nWhen the deceased did not come back in the late night, they\nworried about him, they contacted each other, started search\nfor him and in this procedure they also tried to contact the\nappellant Chandu and they visited his godown also. If they\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">          24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\nwould have not been aware regarding the meeting of the\ndeceased with the appellants, they would have not contacted\nor would have not visited the godown of Chandu. There is no\nevidence that during this time, any of them (Anita, Umesh\nand Mahendra) had come in touch with the Lakshman who\nwas busy with the customers at the restaurant and not aware\nabout any mis-happening with the deceased. There is nothing\nunnatural in his conduct, if he had closed the restaurant at\n10:00 P.M., went to the house of the deceased and handed\nover the keys to his wife and at that time, informed his wife\nthat the deceased had gone with the appellants. He has\nfurther submitted in his statement that appellant Chandu and\nAkbar used to come at restaurant, therefore, he was\nacquainted with them. He also identified them in the Court.\nNothing is there on record to disbelieve all this natural\nstatements of the witnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">50.   Wife of the deceased Anita has stated that the entries in\nthe register Article- A are in hand writing of her husband and\nthis fact has not been challenged during cross-examination of\nthe witnesses, therefore, now, the appellant cannot go back\nstating that the prosecution has not compared the hand\nwriting of the register with any admitted hand writing.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">51.   Undisputedly, godown belongs to the appellant\nChandu, several articles were recovered from this godown\nand no explanation is put forth by the appellants for this\nrecovery. Evidence regarding recovery and identification of\nshoes, calculator etc. is un-rebutted and fully dependable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">52.   Nothing contrary is demonstrated by the learned\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">         24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\ncounsel for the appellants against the scientific\nevidence produced by the prosecution. Finger prints of\nAkbar and Idrish were found in the godown. DNA\nprofile of blood found on the floor of godown, on the\nShirt of Akbar was matched with the DNA profile of\nAkbar. Similarly, evidence regarding pieces of nylon\nrope recovered from godown and from possession of\nAkbar were matched and matching of button\nrecovered from the godown and shirt recovered from\npossession of Akbar also fortified the case of the\nprosecution. These are the evidences, which directly\nestablish involvement of the appellants in the alleged\ncrime. To bolster this conclusion recovery of shoes\nand calculator and other belongings of the deceased\nfrom godown of Chandu and its identification by the\nwife of the deceased Anita is also available on record.\nImpartiality or credibility of officials of FSL who are\nexamined by the prosecution, is neither questioned by\nthe appellants during cross-examination nor do we\nfind any fact which adversely affects their credibility.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">53. Considering all the evidence produced by the\nprosecution, in its totality, we find that sufficient\nevidence is produced by the prosecution to indicate\nthat none else then the appellants had caused the\nalleged incident i.e. murder of the deceased Shailendra\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">                  24. Criminal Appeal No.1099/2008\n\n\n\n      @ Kallu, therefore, the learned trial Court has rightly\n      held them guilty. So far as punishment awarded by the\n      learned trial Court is concerned, we are satisfied on\n      this account also and we also confirmed the order of\n      the learned trial Court regarding disposal of the\n      property.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">      54.
