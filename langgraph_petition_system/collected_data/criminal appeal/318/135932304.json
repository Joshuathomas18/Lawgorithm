Two important issues arise in these three matters as I\n\nshall elaborate further in this order.     Appeal Nos.740/2022 and\n\n741/2022 in effect are filed by the original complainant for\n\ncancellation of anticipatory bail granted to the respondent No.1\n\nrespectively   in   those   appeals;     whereas   Criminal          Appeal\n\nNo.603/2022 is preferred by the appellant challenging the order\n\ndated 22.4.2022 passed in Criminal Bail Application No.441/2021\n\nby the Additional Sessions Judge, Panvel-Raigad. By the impugned\n\norder the appellant&#x27;s anticipatory bail application under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_1\">Section\n\n438</a> of Cr.P.C. was rejected. All these three appeals are filed under\n\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/162493942/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 14-A</a> of the Scheduled Castes and the\n\nScheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as the &#x27;Atrocities Act&#x27;). For the sake of convenience, the\n\nrespondent No.2 in Criminal Appeal No.603/2022 is referred to as\n\nthe &#x27;complainant&#x27;, the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.603/2022 is\n\nreferred to as the &#x27;husband&#x27; and the respondent No.1 in each of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                               2 / 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">                                                   20.apeal-603-22-group.odt\n\n\nother appeals are referred to as the &#x27;parents-in-law&#x27;.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">2.        The FIR was lodged by the complainant, who is wife of\n\nthe appellant in Criminal Appeal No.603/2022 on 25.11.2020 at\n\nKharghar police station vide C.R. No.252/2020 under Sections 498-\n\nA, 323, 504, 506 read with 34 of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">Indian Penal Code</a>. Initially\n\nthe provisions of the Atrocities Act were not invoked. On\n\n25.1.2021, the provisions under <a href=\"/doc/78807341/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 3(1)(r)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/75699932/\" id=\"a_5\">3(1)(s)</a> were\n\napplied. Subsequently on 6.4.2022, <a href=\"/doc/124972012/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 3(1)(c)</a>,(p),(q), and\n\n(zb) of the Atrocities Act were added. Since at this stage I am not\n\ndeciding these appeals on merits I am not making observations on\n\nthe merits of the case. For the purpose of passing this order, it is\n\nnecessary to refer to only the gist of the allegations in the FIR. The\n\nFIR mentions that the complainant belongs to a Scheduled Tribe\n\nfrom Uttarakhand. She came in contact with the husband through a\n\nmatrimonial site.    The marriage took place between them on\n\n4.2.2020. There are various allegations in the FIR, which according\n\nto the complainant attract the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_7\">Indian Penal Code</a>\n\nunder which the FIR is lodged as well as the provisions under the\n\nAtrocities Act which are mentioned hereinabove. Various instances\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                               3 / 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       4</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">                                                   20.apeal-603-22-group.odt\n\n\nare described in detail in the FIR.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3.        Learned      counsel        for   the   appellant-husband\n\nDr.Chandrachood addressed some issues on merits of the case.\n\nHowever, his main thrust of argument at this stage was that the\n\nScheduled Tribe to which the complainant allegedly belongs, was\n\ndeclared as a &#x27;Scheduled Tribe&#x27; only in the State of Uttarakhand and\n\nnot in any other State. The allegations pertain to the incidents\n\nwhich had allegedly taken place in Delhi and in U.K. Therefore,\n\naccording to Dr. Chandrachood the provisions of the Atrocities Act\n\nare not applicable. This was his main contention.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">4.        Today the arguments were heard mainly on this point\n\nand all the points on merits of the matter were left open because I\n\npropose to refer these issues to a Larger Bench and, therefore, all\n\nthe points on the merits of the matter are left open.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">5.        As far as the main contention raised before me today is\n\nconcerned, this is an important issue which will have impact on\n\nmany cases in different States and, therefore, it is necessary that\n\nthis issue is decided with reference to the submissions made by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                               4 / 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                        5</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">                                                        20.apeal-603-22-group.odt\n\n\nDr.Chandrachood.         His main argument was based on two\n\njudgments of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court which were delivered by\n\ntwo different Constitution Benches consisting of five Judges\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">6.         Before referring to submissions of both sides in detail, it\n\nis necessary to refer to certain provisions which would help in\n\ncrystallizing the issue before the Court. The Atrocities Act was\n\nenacted in the year 1989. The &quot;Scheduled Castes and Scheduled\n\nTribes&quot; were defined under Section 2(1)(c) of the Atrocities Act\n\nthus :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     &quot;2.

It has, however, to be borne in mind that a man does not\n          cease to belong to his caste by migration to a better or more\n          socially free and liberal atmosphere. But if sufficiently long\n          time is spent in socially advanced area then the inhibitions\n          and handicaps suffered by belonging to a socially\n          disadvantageous community do not continue and the\n          natural talent of a man or a woman or a boy or girl gets full\n          scope to flourish. These, however, are problems of social\n          adjustment i.e. how far protection has to be given to a\n          certain segment of socially disadvantaged community and\n          for how long to become equal with others is a matter of\n          delicate social adjustment. These must be so balanced in\n          the mosaic of the country&#x27;s integrity that no section or\n          community should cause detriment or discontentment to\n          other community or part of community or section.\n          Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes belonging to a\n          particular area of the country must be given protection so\n          long as and to the extent they are entitled in order to\n          become equal with others. But equally those who go to\n          other areas should also ensure that they make way for the\n          disadvantaged and disabled of that part of the community\n          who suffer from disabilities in those areas. In other words,\n          Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes say of Andhra\n          Pradesh do require necessary protection as balanced\n          between other communities. But equally the Scheduled\n          Castes and Scheduled Tribes say of Maharashtra in the\n          instant case, do require protection in the State of\n          Maharashtra, which will have to be in balance to other\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                                       8 / 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                              9</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">                                              20.apeal-603-22-group.odt\n\n\ncommunities. This must be the basic approach to the\nproblem. If one bears this basic approach in mind, then the\ndetermination of the controversy in the instant case does\nnot become difficult. For the purpose of understanding the\nproblem, it may be worthwhile to refer to the Report of the\nJoint Committee of the Parliament on the Scheduled Castes\nand Scheduled Tribes (Amendment) Order Bill, 1967. It\nmay also be worthwhile to refer to the proceedings of the\nConstituent Assembly on September 17, 1949 dealing with\ndraft <a href=\"/doc/1327219/\" id=\"a_19\">Articles 303</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1392920/\" id=\"a_20\">304</a>, which later on became <a href=\"/doc/68762/\" id=\"a_21\">Articles\n341</a> and <a href=\"/doc/768139/\" id=\"a_22\">342</a> respectively.

Constitutional\nright, e.g., it has been argued that right to migration or right\nto move from one part to another is a right given to all -- to\nScheduled Castes or Tribes and to non-scheduled castes or\ntribes. But when a Scheduled Caste or Tribe migrates, there\nis no inhibition in migrating but when he migrates, he does\nnot and cannot carry any special rights or privileges\nattributed to him or granted to him in the original State\nspecified for that State or area or part thereof. If that right is\nnot given in the migrated State it does not interfere with his\nconstitutional right of equality or of migration or of\ncarrying on his trade, business or profession. Neither\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 14</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_27\">, 16</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_28\">, 19</a> nor <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 21</a> is denuded by migration\nbut he must enjoy those rights in accordance with the law if\nthey are otherwise followed in the place where he migrates.\nThere should be harmonious construction, harmonious in\nthe sense that both parts or all parts of a constitutional\nprovision should be so read that one part does not become\nnugatory to the other or denuded to the other but all parts\nmust be read in the context in which these are used. It was\ncontended that the only way in which the fundamental\nrights of the petitioner under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_30\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_31\">, 19(1)(d)</a><a href=\"/doc/844404/\" id=\"a_32\">, 19(1)(e)</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/258019/\" id=\"a_33\">19(1)(f)</a> could be given effect to is by construing\n<a href=\"/doc/768139/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 342</a> in a manner by which a member of a Scheduled\nTribe gets the benefit of that status for the purposes of the\nConstitution throughout the territory of India. It was\nsubmitted that the words &quot;for the purposes of this\nConstitution&quot; must be given full effect. There is no dispute\nabout that. The words &quot;for the purposes of this\nConstitution&quot; must mean that a Scheduled Caste so\ndesignated must have right under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_35\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1024002/\" id=\"a_36\">, 19(1)(d)</a><a href=\"/doc/844404/\" id=\"a_37\">,\n19(1)(e)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/258019/\" id=\"a_38\">19(1)(f)</a> inasmuch as these are applicable to\nhim in his area where he migrates or where he goes.

It will also be inconsistent with the whole\n     purpose of the scheme of reservation. In Andhra Pradesh, a\n     Scheduled Caste or a Scheduled Tribe may require\n     protection because a boy or a child who grows in that area\n     is inhibited or is at disadvantage. In Maharashtra that caste\n     or that tribe may not be so inhibited but other castes or\n     tribes might be. If a boy or a child goes to that atmosphere\n     of Maharashtra as a young boy or a child and goes in a\n     completely different atmosphere or Maharashtra where this\n     inhibition or this disadvantage is not there, then he cannot\n     be said to have that reservation which will denude the\n     children or the people of Maharashtra belonging to any\n     segment of that State who may still require that protection.\n     After all, it has to be borne in mind that the protection is\n     necessary for the disadvantaged castes or tribes of\n     Maharashtra as well as disadvantaged castes or tribes of\n     Andhra Pradesh. Thus, balancing must be done as between\n     those who need protection and those who need no\n     protection, i.e., who belong to advantaged castes or tribes\n     and who do not. Treating the determination under <a href=\"/doc/68762/\" id=\"a_39\">Articles\n     341</a> and <a href=\"/doc/768139/\" id=\"a_40\">342</a> of the Constitution to be valid for all over the\n     country would be in negation to the very purpose and\n     scheme and language of <a href=\"/doc/68762/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 341</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/251667/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 15(4)</a>\n     of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"49977804\" id=\"span_24\">14. Our attention was drawn to certain observations in\n    <a href=\"/doc/49977804/\" id=\"a_43\">Elizabeth Warburton v. James Loveland</a>, [1832 HL 499]. It\n    is true that all provisions should be read harmoniously. It is\n    also true that no provision should be so read as to make\n    other provisions nugatory or restricted. But having regard\n    to the purpose, it appears to us that harmonious\n    construction enjoins that we should give to each expression</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">    --&quot;in relation to that State&quot; or &quot;for the purposes of this\n    Constitution&quot; -- its full meaning and give their full effect.\n    This must be so construed that one must not negate the\n    other.

We may add that considerations for specifying a particular\n          caste or tribe or class for inclusion in the list of Scheduled\n          Castes/Schedule Tribes or backward classes in a given State\n          would depend on the nature and extent of disadvantages\n          and social hardships suffered by that caste, tribe or class in\n          that State which may be totally non est in another State to\n          which persons belonging thereto may migrate.\n          Coincidentally it may be that a caste or tribe bearing the\n          same nomenclature is specified in two States but the\n          considerations on the basis of which they have been\n          specified may be totally different. So also the degree of\n          disadvantages of various elements which constitute the\n          input for specification may also be totally different.\n          Therefore, merely because a given caste is specified in\n          State A as a Scheduled Caste does not necessarily mean that\n          if there be another caste bearing the same nomenclature in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                                                   13 / 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                14</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">                                                  20.apeal-603-22-group.odt\n\n\nanother State the person belonging to the former would be\nentitled to the rights, privileges and benefits admissible to a\nmember of the Scheduled Caste of the latter State &quot;for the\npurposes of this Constitution&quot;. This is an aspect which has\nto be kept in mind and which was very much in the minds\nof the Constitution-makers as is evident from the choice of\nlanguage of <a href=\"/doc/68762/\" id=\"a_44\">Articles 341</a> and <a href=\"/doc/768139/\" id=\"a_45\">342</a> of the Constitution. That\nis why in answer to a question by Mr Jaipal Singh, Dr\nAmbedkar answered as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">     &quot;He asked me another question and it was this.\n     Supposing a member of a Scheduled Tribe living\n     in a tribal area migrates to another part of the\n     territory of India, which is outside both the\n     scheduled area and the tribal area, will he be able\n     to claim from the local Government, within\n     whose jurisdiction he may be residing the same\n     privileges which he would be entitled to when he\n     is residing within the scheduled area or within\n     the tribal area? It is a difficult question for me to\n     answer. If that matter is agitated in quarters\n     where a decision on a matter like this would lie,\n     we would certainly be able to give some answer\n     to the question in the form of some clause in this\n     Constitution. But so far as the present\n     Constitution stands, a member of a Scheduled\n     Tribe going outside the scheduled area or tribal\n     area would certainly not be entitled to carry with\n     him the privileges that he is entitled to when he\n     is residing in a scheduled area or a tribal area. So\n     far as I can see, it will be practicably impossible\n     to enforce the provisions that apply to tribal areas\n     or scheduled areas, in areas other than those\n     which are covered by them....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">Relying on this statement the Constitution Bench ruled that\nthe petitioner was not entitled to admission to the medical\ncollege on the basis that he belonged to a Scheduled Tribe\nin the State of his origin.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                                          14 / 25</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                           15</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">                                                            20.apeal-603-22-group.odt\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"79484993\" id=\"span_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"173168166\" id=\"span_32\">10.
