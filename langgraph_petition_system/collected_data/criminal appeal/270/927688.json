Answering the\n\nsaid question, this Court held that the provisions\n\nof    the     <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_149\">Criminal     Procedure       Code</a>   would    apply    in\n\nrespect of investigation and trial even in respect\n\nof such enactments, but would be subject to any\n\nprovision          regulating        the     manner        of     such\n\ninvestigation and             trial.

In our view,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/122873638/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 9(1)</a> contemplates filing of complaints both\n\nby    the   investigating       authorities        and     also     by\n\nprivate parties and the learned Special Judge is,\n\ntherefore, entitled to take cognizance of offences\n\nunder MCOCA even on a private complaint, but after\n\ndue compliance with <a href=\"/doc/849476/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 23(2)</a> thereof.                  In view\n\nof    the    stringent        provisions      of     MCOCA,        the\n\nLegislature        included       certain     safeguards           for\n\ninvoking     the     provisions    thereof.        The     same     is\n\nmanifest from the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/849476/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 23</a> as a\n\nwhole.

In such\n\na situation, even as far as a private complaint is\n\nconcerned, sanction has to be obtained from the\n\nPolice Officer not below the rank of Additional\n\nDirector    General     of    Police,   before       the   Special\n\nJudge     can   take    cognizance      of    such    complaint.\n\nAccordingly, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/122873638/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 9(1)</a> will\n\nhave to be read in harmony with the provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/849476/\" id=\"a_171\">Section    23(2)</a>   as   far    as   private    complaints      are\n\nconcerned, and we have no hesitation in negating\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">\f                                                                         39</span>\n\nthe    majority     view        of    the     Full       Bench    holding\n\notherwise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">39.

In other words,\n\neven on a private complaint about the commission of\n\nan     offence    of     organized           crime        under      MCOCA\n\ncognizance cannot be taken by the Special Judge\n\nwithout    due    compliance          with    Sub-Section         (1)    of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/849476/\" id=\"a_176\">Section    23</a>,    which         starts       with    a     non-obstante\n\nclause.     As indicated hereinabove, the provisions\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/849476/\" id=\"a_177\">Section 23</a> are the safeguards provided against\n\nthe invocation of the provisions of the Act which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">\f                                                                       40</span>\n\nare extremely stringent and far removed from the\n\nprovisions of the general criminal law.

At the\n\nsame time, since the filing of a private complaint\n\nis also contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/122873638/\" id=\"a_180\">Section 9(1)</a> of MCOCA,\n\nfor it to be entertained it has also to be subject\n\nto the rigours of <a href=\"/doc/849476/\" id=\"a_181\">Section 23</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_72\">40.
