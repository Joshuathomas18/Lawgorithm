In  order  to  take\nrevenge of the said demolition, Tiger  Memon  (AA)  and  Dawood  Ibrahim,  a\nresident of Dubai, formulated a conspiracy to commit a terrorist act in  the\ncity of Bombay.  In pursuance of the said object, Dawood Ibrahim  agreed  to\nsend arms and ammunitions from abroad.  Tiger  Memon,  in  association  with\nhis  men,  particularly,  the  accused  persons,  received  those  arms  and\nammunitions through sea-coasts of  Bombay.   In  continuation  of  the  said\nconspiracy, Tiger Memon sent some of the accused persons to Dubai  and  from\nthere to Pakistan for training and handling in arms and ammunitions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(b)   On 12.03.1993, the commercial hub of the country, the city of  Bombay,\nwitnessed an unprecedented terrorist act sending shock waves throughout  the\nworld.

Inasmuch  as\nonly ‘operative portion’ was read out and  after  hearing  the  accused  the\nconviction and sentence was imposed, it  is  not  permissible  in  law.   He\nfurther pointed out that as per the “operative portion”, A-1  was  convicted\nand sentenced to death, RI  along  with  fine  for  commission  of  offences\nmentioned in charges at head firstly to fifthly.   In  the  absence  of  the\nentire judgment in terms of the above mentioned provisions,  the  conviction\nand sentence imposed on A-1 cannot be sustained.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">(ii)  The prosecution mainly relied on the evidence of  Mohammed  Usman  Jan\nKhan (PW-2), who turned approver.   According  to  learned  senior  counsel,\nthere is no provision for pardoning an accused and permitting him to  become\nan approver under TADA.  He further pointed out that neither under TADA  nor\nunder the Code it can be said that PW-2 has been validly pardoned.   In  any\nevent, according  to  him,  his  statement  needs  to  be  corroborated  and\nconviction based on his sole testimony cannot be sustained.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">(iii) The Special Judge heavily relied on the confessional statements of  A-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_70\">10, A-11, A-46,  A-67  and  A-97.   Among  them,  except  A-97  others  have\nretracted their statements.  Since the prosecution case rests entirely  upon\nthe confessional statements of those  accused  persons,  in  view  of  their\nretraction statements, the conviction and sentence cannot be sustained.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_71\">(iv)  Several recoveries were made by the prosecution on  the  statement  of\nMd. Hanif (PW-282) and in the absence of strict adherence to the  procedure,\nthose recoveries are inadmissible in evidence.  He further pointed out  that\nseizure panchnamas were not in  accordance  with  the  procedure  and,  more\nparticularly, <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">(v)   All the confessional statements are exculpatory and  not  inculpatory.\nIn view of the same, the entire statements made are not acceptable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">(vi)  There is no material to prove that there was a  conspiracy  among  the\naccused persons pursuant to the demolition of Babri Masjid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_74\">(vii) In any event, the prosecution failed to pin point  the  specific  role\nof A-1.  A-1 had no knowledge of the conspiracy and  of  the  ultimate  bomb\nblasts on 12.03.1993.   Even, the confessional  statements  cannot  be  used\nagainst A-1 since the same were recorded before  the  amendment  of  <a href=\"/doc/119640511/\" id=\"a_34\">Section\n3(5)</a>  of  TADA.    Considering  the  entire  evidence   against   him,   the\nprosecution failed to point out any specific role,  accordingly,  the  death\nsentence is not warranted and other sentences are  also  liable  to  be  set\naside.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_75\">Reply by CBI:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">8)    Mr. Gopal  Subramanium,  learned  senior  counsel  for  the  CBI  duly\nassisted by Mr. Mukul  Gupta,  learned  senior  counsel  and  Mr.  Satyakam,\nlearned counsel met all the points raised by Mr. Jaspal Singh.   He  pointed\nout the following evidence against the appellant (A1), namely;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">(i) confessional statements made by co-accused;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">(ii) testimonies of prosecution witnesses; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">(iii) documentary evidence.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">According to him, it is incorrect to state that conviction was based  solely\non the evidence of Approver (PW-2).  He pointed  out  that  the  prosecution\nhas placed enough materials to substantiate “conspiracy”  and  the  ultimate\nrole played by each one of the accused persons,  particularly  A-1,  in  the\ncommission of offence.   He further pointed out  that  all  the  confessions\nmade  by  the  accused,  namely,  A-10,  A-11,  A-46,  A-67  and  A-97   are\nadmissible, and on the other  hand,  their  alleged  retractions  cannot  be\naccepted.  He further pointed out that apart from the  confession  of  those\naccused, the prosecution has  established  several  incriminating  materials\nconnecting all the accused in the commission of  offence.   He  pointed  out\nvarious  recoveries  made  against  the  accused  which  clearly  show   the\nseriousness of the matter. Among all the accused persons,  A-1,  brother  of\nTiger Memon, was in-charge of entire financial management,  sending  persons\nto Pakistan via Dubai for training in arms and  ammunitions,  securing  air-\ntickets and travel documents such  as  passports,  visas  etc.   He  further\npointed out that there was no flaw in the procedure adopted by  the  Special\nCourt in delivering the judgment.  There is no merit in the appeal filed  by\nA-1 and prayed for confirmation of death sentence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">9)     We  have  carefully  considered  the  entire  materials,   oral   and\ndocumentary evidence and the submissions made by either side.\nValidity of impugned judgment by the Special Court\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_78\">10)   Among various points raised, since the argument relating  to  impugned\njudgment is paramount, we intend to take up the said issue at the  foremost.\n  Mr. Jaspal Singh, learned senior counsel for  A-1,  took  us  through  the\nimpugned judgment which contains  two  parts.   According  to  him,  in  the\nabsence of whole judgment for perusal of the accused, the  sentence  imposed\ncannot be sustained.  In support of the above claim, he relied  on  Sections\n353, 354, 362 and 363 of  the  Code.   He  further  pointed  out  that  only\n‘operative portion’ was read out and after hearing the  accused,  conviction\nand sentence was imposed.  As per the operative portion, A-1  was  convicted\nunder <a href=\"/doc/105771932/\" id=\"a_35\">Sections 3(3)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_36\">5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/47052902/\" id=\"a_37\">6</a>  of  TADA  read  with  <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_38\">Section  120-B</a>  IPC  and\n<a href=\"/doc/1056565/\" id=\"a_39\">Sections 3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/895566/\" id=\"a_40\">4</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1539301/\" id=\"a_41\">6</a> of the  Explosive  Substances  Act,  1984.   He  further\npointed out that after convicting and sentencing A-1, the Presiding  Officer\nstated that the reasons will be given within two months  which  shows  that,\nadmittedly, the judgment was not ready on the date of the pronouncement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">11)   In view of the above, it is  desirable  to  go  through  the  relevant\nprovisions of TADA.  The  TADA  contains:  (a)  judgment;  and  (b)  orders,\nadmittedly,  it  is  not  defined   anywhere   that   what   is   meant   by\njudgment/order.  It is the claim of  the  learned  senior  counsel  for  the\nappellant that  if  it  is  not  a  complete  judgment,  accused  cannot  be\nconvicted and sentenced.  In the absence of specific provision in TADA  with\nregard to the same, we have to look into  the  relevant  provisions  of  the\nCode.  Chapter XXVII of the Code  speaks  about  ‘Judgment’.

In  the  absence  of\nreasoning and the discussion in the form of full judgment, it  is  contended\nthat  the  conviction  and  sentence  under  various  provisions   are   not\npermissible.  He also pointed out that in case of  death  sentence,  special\nreasons have to be assigned.  According to Mr. Jaspal  Singh,  in  terms  of\nSection 353 of the Code, the judgment means the  whole  judgment  signed  by\nthe Judge.  He elaborated that when the Code permits the Court to  hear  the\naccused on sentence, he must be provided with the whole  judgment  including\nthe reasons.  According to him, though A-1 was awarded  death  sentence,  no\nspecial reasons were assigned by the Designated Court and he  was  not  even\nfurnished the whole  judgment.   By  highlighting  various  aspects  on  the\nissue, in view of the fact that the  judgment  pronounced  is  not  a  “full\njudgment” in terms of the above said provisions,  Mr.  Jaspal  Singh  prayed\nfor remand to the Special Court to go through all  the  reasoning  and  hear\nafresh on the question of sentence.  Though Mr. Gopal  Subramanium  met  all\nthe submissions relating to the alleged defect  in  the  impugned  judgment,\nfirst let us consider the  decisions  relied  on  by  Mr.  Jaspal  Singh  in\nsupport of the above proposition.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"347841\" id=\"span_1\">13)   In <a href=\"/doc/347841/\" id=\"a_44\">Shambhu &amp; Ors. vs. The State</a> AIR  1956  All.  633,  learned  single\nJudge of the High Court with regard to the words “judgment” and “order”  has\nheld as under:-</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">      “4. The argument sounds plausible; nevertheless I have  no  hesitation\n      in holding it to be untenable. A study of the provisions of  the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_45\">Code\n      of Criminal Procedure</a> discloses that the expression of the opinion  of\n      the criminal Court on  any  matter  at  issue  arrived  at  after  due\n      consideration of the evidence and of the arguments (if any) falls into\n      two categories : judgments and orders. None-theless neither  of  these\n      terms has been defined either in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_46\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> or the\n      <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_47\">Indian Penal Code</a>.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">      There is, however, no controversy as to what a &quot;judgment&quot; is. As  held\n      by the Federal Court in Hori Ram Singh v. Emperor AIR 1939 PC  43  (A)\n      and  Kuppuswami  Rao  v.  The  King,  it  is  used  &quot;to  indicate  the\n      termination of the case by an order of conviction or acquittal of  the\n      accused&quot;, and to this, by virtue of Section  367(6),  Criminal  P.  C.\n      must be added orders under Sections 118 or 123 (3), orders which  bear\n      the  character  of  a  conviction.  Chapter  26  of  the  Code   deals\n      exclusively  with  judgments  and  on  the  basis  of  its  exhaustive\n      provisions there can  be  no  difficulty  in  recognising  a  criminal\n      Court&#x27;s &quot;judgment&quot;.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">14)   In Baldeo. vs. Deo Narain and  Ors.  AIR  1954  All.  104,  there  was\ndiscussion about how the judgment to be in terms of the  provisions  of  the\nCode.  The relevant para is as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">      “14.…..Under Section 367, Criminal P. C. every judgment must contain:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">      (1) the points for determination;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">      (2) the decision thereon; and\n      (3) the reasons for such decision.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">      Where the reasons given by the trial  Court  are  such  as  cannot  be\n      supported by the evidence on record, they  are  not  reasons  for  the\n      decision, out reasons against the  decision.  To  constitute  a  legal\n      appreciation of evidence, the Judgment should be such as  to  indicate\n      that the Court has applied its  mind  to  it.  Every  portion  of  the\n      Judgment of the trial Court seems to indicate non-application of  mind\n      by the Court to the evidence on record.  The  third  requirement  laid\n      down in Section  367,  Criminal  P.  C.  viz.,  the  reasons  for  the\n      decision, is an important ingredient of a  Judgment.  Compliance  with\n      law in this regard should not be merely  formal  but  substantial  and\n      real, for it is this part of the  judgment  alone  which  enables  the\n      higher Court to  appreciate  the  correctness  of  the  decision,  the\n      parties to feel that the Court has fully  and  impartially  considered\n      their respective cases and the public to realise that  a  genuine  and\n      sincere attempt has been made to mete out even-handed Justice.  It  is\n      in the way the Court discharges its duty in this  regard  that  it  is\n      able to instil confidence in its justice and to inspire  that  respect\n      and reverence in public mind  which  is  its  due.  Reasons  form  the\n      substratum of the decision and their factual accuracy is  a  guarantee\n      that the Court has applied its mind to the evidence in the case. Where\n      the statement of reasons turn out to be a mere hollow pretension of  a\n      baseless claim of application of mind by the Court,  the  Judgment  is\n      robbed of one of its most essential ingredients and forfeits its claim\n      to be termed a Judgment in the eye of law.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"142543\" id=\"span_2\">15)   In <a href=\"/doc/142543/\" id=\"a_48\">Surendra Singh &amp; Ors. vs. State of Uttar Pradesh</a> AIR 1954  SC  194,\nthis Court has interpreted the word “judgment”.   The  following  conclusion\nis relevant which reads as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">      “10. In our opinion, a judgment within the meaning of  these  sections\n      is the final decision of the court intimated to the parties and to the\n      world at large by formal &quot;pronouncement&quot; or &quot;delivery&quot; in open  court.\n      It is a judicial act which must be performed in a judicial way.  Small\n      irregularities in the manner of pronouncement or the mode of  delivery\n      do not matter but the substance of the thing must be there : that  can\n      neither be blurred nor left to inference and conjecture nor can it  be\n      vague. All the rest - the manner in which it is to  be  recorded,  the\n      way in which it is to be authenticated, the signing and  the  sealing,\n      all the rules designed to  secure  certainty  about  its  content  and\n      matter - can be cured; but  not  the  hard  core,  namely  the  formal\n      intimation of the decision and its contents  formally  declared  in  a\n      judicial way in open court. The exact way in which this is  done  does\n      not matter. In some courts the judgment is delivered  orally  or  read\n      out, in some only the operative portion is  pronounced,  in  some  the\n      judgment is merely signed after  giving  notice  to  the  parties  and\n      laying the draft  on  the  table  for  a  given  number  of  days  for\n      inspection.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">      11. An important point  therefore  arises.  It  is  evident  that  the\n      decision which is so pronounced or intimated must be a declaration  of\n      the mind of the court as it is at the time of pronouncement. We lay on\n      stress on the mode of manner of  delivery,  as  that  is  not  of  the\n      essence, except to say that it must be done in a judicial way in  open\n      court. But however it is done it must be an expression of the mind  of\n      the court at the time of delivery. We say this  because  that  is  the\n      first judicial act touching the  judgment  which  the  court  performs\n      after the hearing. Everything else up till then is done out  of  court\n      and is not intended to  be  the  operative  act  which  sets  all  the\n      consequences which follow on the judgment in motion. Judges  may,  and\n      often do, discuss the matter among themselves and  reach  a  tentative\n      conclusion. That is not their judgment. They may  write  and  exchange\n      drafts. Those are not the judgments either, however heavily and  often\n      they may have been signed. The final operative act is  that  which  is\n      formally declared in open court with the intention of  making  it  the\n      operative  decision  of  the  court.  That  is  what  constitutes  the\n      &quot;judgment&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">      14. As soon as the judgment is delivered, that becomes  the  operative\n      pronouncement of the court. The law then provides for  the  manner  in\n      which it is to be authenticated and made certain. The rules  regarding\n      this differ but they do not form the essence  of  the  matter  and  if\n      there is irregularity in carrying them out it is curable. Thus,  if  a\n      judgment happens not to be signed and is inadvertently  acted  on  and\n      executed, the proceedings consequent on it would be valid  because  of\n      the judgment, if it can be shown to have been validly delivered, would\n      stand  good  despite  defects  in   the   mode   of   its   subsequent\n      authentication.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">16)   In Ratia Mohan. vs. The State  of  Gujarat  AIR  1969  Guj.  320,  the\nfollowing para is pressed into service:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">      “9.  In  this  connection,  I  was  referred  to  a  decision  In  re.\n      Athipalayan, AIR 1960 Mad 507, where it was held that the irregularity\n      even in pronouncing the judgment in open Court and signing and  dating\n      the same would amount to an illegality vitiating  the  conviction  and\n      sentence passed in the case.

The\n      accused-appellant had a right  to  know  the  reasons  which  led  the\n      learned Magistrate to come to that conclusion. It may well happen that\n      after coming to know about the accused going in  appeal,  the  learned\n      Magistrate may try to record a proper judgment which otherwise he  may\n      later on do in some other manner.

It is desirable that the final order which  the  High  Court\n      intends to pass should not be announced until a reasoned  judgment  is\n      ready for pronouncement. Suppose, for  example,  that  a  final  order\n      without a reasoned judgment is announced by  the  High  Court  that  a\n      house shall be demolished, or that the custody of  a  child  shall  be\n      handed over to one parent as against  the  order,  or  that  a  person\n      accused of a serious  charge  is  acquitted,  or  that  a  statute  is\n      unconstitutional or, as in the instant case, that a detenu be released\n      from detention. If the object of passing  such  orders  is  to  ensure\n      speedy compliance with them, that object is more often defeated by the\n      aggrieved party filing a special leave petition in this Court  against\n      the order passed by the High  Court.  That  places  this  Court  in  a\n      predicament because, without the benefit of the reasoning of the  High\n      Court, it is difficult for this Court to allow the bare  order  to  be\n      implemented. The result inevitably is that the operation of the  order\n      passed by the High Court has to be  stayed  pending  delivery  of  the\n      reasoned judgment.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"935385\" id=\"span_8\">20)   The next decision relied on is <a href=\"/doc/935385/\" id=\"a_60\">Krishna Swami vs. Union  of  India  and\nOrs.</a>, AIR 1993 SC 1407, which is a Constitution  Bench  decision.

The Supreme Court  by  a  majority  held\n      that “procedure established by law” means any procedure established by\n      law made by Parliament or the legislatures of the State.  The  Supreme\n      Court refused to infuse  the  procedure  with  principles  of  natural\n      justice. It concentrated solely upon the  existence  of  enacted  law.\n      After three decades, the Supreme Court overruled its previous decision\n      in A.K. Gopalan and held in its landmark judgment in <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_68\">Maneka Gandhi  v.\n      Union of India</a> that the procedure  contemplated  by  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_69\">Article  21</a>  must\n      answer the test of reasonableness. The <a href=\"/doc/1766147/\" id=\"a_70\">Court  further  held</a>  that  the\n      procedure should also be in conformity with the principles of  natural\n      justice. This example is given to demonstrate an instance of expansive\n      interpretation of  a  fundamental  right.  The  expression  “life”  in\n      <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 21</a> does not connote merely physical or animal  existence.  The\n      right to life includes right to live with human  dignity.

For\n      example, freedom of information has been held to be  implicit  in  the\n      guarantee  of  freedom  of  speech  and  expression.  In  India,  till\n      recently, there was no legislation securing  freedom  of  information.\n      However, this Court by a liberal interpretation deduced the  right  to\n      know and right to access information on the reasoning that the concept\n      of an open Government is the direct result  from  the  right  to  know\n      which  is  implicit  in  the  right  of  free  speech  and  expression\n      guaranteed under <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 19(1)(a)</a>.”</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1446617\" id=\"span_13\">24)   In Confederation of ex-Servicemen <a href=\"/doc/1446617/\" id=\"a_73\">Associations and  Others  vs.  Union\nof India and Ors.</a> (2006) 8 SCC  399  which  is  also  a  Constitution  Bench\njudgment, this Court held as under:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">        “61.

It was urged that the procedure adopted  in  this  respect\nby learned Sessions Judge was not in accordance with law.   This  submission\nwas not acceptable to the Bench.  The following observation  and  conclusion\nare relevant:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">       “6…The report of Shri Gupte shows that he dictated  the  judgment  in\n   the case against the petitioner in open court. The judgment included,  as\n   it must, the concluding part relating  to  the  conviction  and  sentence\n   awarded to the petitioner. The petitioner who  apparently  did  not  know\n   English was thereafter apprised by the Sheristedar of the  Court  of  the\n   concluding part of the judgment relating to his conviction and  sentence.\n   Although normally the trial Judges should themselves convey the result of\n   the trial to the accused, the fact that the learned Judge in the  present\n   case did not do so and left it to the Sheristedar would not introduce  an\n   infirmity in the procedure adopted by him. The Sheristedar  in  the  very\n   nature of  things  must  have  translated  to  the  petitioner  what  was\n   contained in the concluding part of the judgment. It was, in our opinion,\n   the dictation of the concluding part of the judgment in open court by the\n   learned Sessions Judge which should in the circumstances be taken  to  be\n   tantamount to the pronouncement of the judgment.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">      8. Question then arises as to whether the appellant can be said to  be\n   not properly imprisoned if  the  trial  Judge  had  merely  dictated  the\n   judgment but not signed it because of its not having been transcribed  at\n   the time he pronounced it. So far as this aspect is  concerned,  we  find\n   that <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 537</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure provides, inter  alia,\n   that subject to the other provisions of the Code, no finding, sentence or\n   order passed by a Court of competent jurisdiction shall  be  reversed  or\n   altered on appeal or revision  on  account  of  any  error,  omission  or\n   irregularity in the  complaint,  summons,  warrant,  proclamation  order,\n   judgment or other proceedings before or during trial or in any enquiry or\n   other  proceedings  under  this  Code,  unless  such   error,   omission,\n   irregularity has in fact occasioned a failure of justice. This section is\n   designed to ensure that no order of  a  competent  court  should  in  the\n   absence of failure of  justice  be  reversed  or  altered  in  appeal  or\n   revision on account of a procedural irregularity. The  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_79\">Code  of  Criminal\n   Procedure</a> is essentially a code of procedure and like all procedural law,\n   is designed to further the ends of justice and not to frustrate  them  by\n   the introduction of endless technicalities. At the same time it has to be\n   borne in mind that it is procedure that spells  much  of  the  difference\n   between rule of law and rule by whim and caprice. The object of the  Code\n   is to ensure for the accused a full and fair trial in accordance with the\n   principles of natural justice. If there be  substantial  compliance  with\n   the requirements of law, a mere procedural irregularity would not vitiate\n   the trial unless the same results  in  miscarriage  of  justice.  In  all\n   procedural laws certain things are vital. Disregard of the provisions  in\n   respect of them would prove fatal to the trial and would  invalidate  the\n   conviction. There are, however,  other  requirements  which  are  not  so\n   vital. Non-compliance with them would amount  to  an  irregularity  which\n   would be curable unless it has resulted in a failure of justice.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1398571\" id=\"span_15\">26)   The next decision relied on by  learned  senior  counsel  for  CBI  is\nreported in <a href=\"/doc/1398571/\" id=\"a_80\">Rama Narang vs. Ramesh Narang and Ors.</a> (1995) 2 SCC 513  wherein\nit was held  that  judgment  becomes  complete  and  appealable  only  after\nconviction is recorded and also sentence is awarded.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_106\">27)   In view of the above discussion, it is useful to  refer  the  relevant\nprovision of the Code with regard to right of hearing.\nRight of hearing under Section 235(2) of the Code\nRight of hearing to the accused on the  question  of  sentence  is  provided\nunder Section 235(2) of the Code and this provision was introduced  in  view\nof the 48th Report of the Law Commission of India.

It  is  in\nfact humanist principle of individualising punishment  to  suit  the  person\nand  his  circumstances  and,  therefore,  a  hearing  is  required   before\nimposition of penalty.

Non-compliance with the requirement of  Section  235(2)  cannot  be\n     described as mere irregularity in the course of the trial curable under\n     Section 465. It is much more  serious.

Secondly, when\n     no opportunity has been given to the appellant to produce material  and\n     make submissions in regard to  the  sentence  to  be  imposed  on  him,\n     failure of justice must be regarded as implicit. Section 465 cannot, in\n     the circumstances, have any application in a case like the present”.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">     “11….This obviously postulates  that  the  accused  must  be  given  an\n     opportunity of making his representation only regarding the question of\n     sentence and for this purpose he may be allowed to place such materials\n     as he may think fit but which may have bearing only on the question  of\n     sentence. The statute seeks to achieve a socio-economic purpose and  is\n     aimed at attaining the  ideal  principle  of  proper  sentencing  in  a\n     rational and progressive society. The modern concept of punishment  and\n     penology has undergone a vital transformation and the criminal  is  now\n     not looked upon as a grave menace to the society which  should  be  got\n     rid of but as  a  diseased  person  suffering  from  mental  malady  or\n     psychological  frustration  due  to  subconscious  reactions  and   is,\n     therefore, to be cured and  corrected  rather  than  to  be  killed  or\n     destroyed. There may be a number of circumstances of  which  the  Court\n     may not be aware and which may be taken into consideration by the Court\n     while awarding the sentence, particularly a sentence of  death,  as  in\n     the instant case. It will be difficult to lay down any  hard  and  fast\n     rule, but the statement of objects and reasons of the 1973 Code  itself\n     gives a clear illustration. It refers to an instance where the  accused\n     is the sole bread-earner of the family. In such a case if the  sentence\n     of death is passed and executed it  amounts  not  only  to  a  physical\n     effacement  of  the  criminal  but  also  a   complete   socio-economic\n     destruction of the family which he leaves behind. Similarly  there  may\n     be cases, where, after the offence and during the  trial,  the  accused\n     may have developed some virulent  disease  or  some  mental  infirmity,\n     which may be an important factor to be taken into  consideration  while\n     passing the sentence of death. It was for these  reasons  that  Section\n     235(2) of the 1973 Code was enshrined in the Code for  the  purpose  of\n     making the Court aware of these  circumstances  so  that  even  if  the\n     highest penalty of death is passed on the accused he does  not  have  a\n     grievance that he was not heard on his personal,  social  and  domestic\n     circumstances before the sentence was given.”\n\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"418386\" id=\"span_18\">29)  In <a href=\"/doc/418386/\" id=\"a_83\">Ram Deo Chauhan @ Raj Nath Chauhan vs. State of Assam</a>, AIR  2001  SC\n2231, this Court examined the issue at length and held:</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">     “4…..The requirement contained in  Section  235(2)  of  the  Code  (the\n     obligation of the  Judge  to  hear  the  accused  on  the  question  of\n     sentence) is intended  to  achieve  a  purpose.  The  said  legislative\n     provision is meant for affording benefit to the convicted person in the\n     matter of sentence.

(Vide:  Narpal Singh  &amp;  Ors.  vs.\nState of Haryna, AIR 1977 SC 1066).

(Vide: Dagdu &amp; Ors. etc.  vs.  State  of  Maharashtra,  AIR\n1977 SC 1579; Tarlok Singh vs. State  of  Punjab,  AIR  1977  SC  1747;  and\nKamalakar Nandram Bhavsar &amp; Ors. vs.  State  of  Maharashtra,  AIR  2004  SC\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">503).  In case, at the time  of  trial,  there  was  no  objection  for  not\nproviding sufficient time to the accused or in respect of small fraction  of\nthe mandatory provision of Section 235(2) of the Code, he cannot be  allowed\nto raise the plea of prejudice of such non-compliance  at  Appellate  stage.\n(Vide:  Motilal vs. State of M.P. (Now Chhatisgarh), (2004) 2 SCC 469).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_114\">31)   Thus, in view of the above, it  is  evident  that  generally  judgment\nmust be complete  and  it  must  have  points  for  determination,  decision\nthereon and reasons for such a decision.  The  basic  requirement  for  such\ningredients appears to be that  the  superior  court  (appellate/revisional)\nmay be able to examine as to whether the judgment under challenge  has  been\nrendered in accordance with law  and  particularly,  based  on  evidence  on\nrecord.  So, the purpose of recording reasons is to facilitate the  superior\ncourt to examine the correctness of the judgment of  the  courts  below.  So\nfar as the grievance of the accused/convict that opportunity of hearing  was\nnot given by the court below and, thus,  he  failed  to  address  the  court\nappropriately on the issue of sentence, may not have any substance  for  the\nreason that the legislative policy discernible  under  Section  235(2)  read\nwith Section 354(3) is that quantum of punishment is  to  be  determined  on\nconsiderations and circumstances not  merely  connected  with  a  particular\ncrime but  a  court  is  bound  to  give  due  consideration  to  the  other\ncircumstances also of the criminal.  It is for this reason that court  while\nhearing a convict on sentence is required to give a party an opportunity  of\nproducing evidence or materials relating to the various factors having  some\nbearing on the question of  sentence.   The  court,  while  determining  the\nquantum of sentence, acts in an altogether different domain in  which  facts\nand factors which operate are of an  entirely  different  order  than  those\nwhich come into play on the question of  conviction.   Therefore,  there  is\nbifurcation of trial as an accused has a  right  of  pre-conviction  hearing\nunder Section 234 and secondly right of pre-sentence hearing  under  Section\n235 of the Code. For  pre-conviction  hearing,  the  accused  must  be  well\ninformed as to what the exact prosecution case is  and  what  evidence  have\nbeen  adduced  by  the  prosecution  to  prove  its  case.  It  is  for  the\nprosecution to prove its case beyond reasonable doubt, as in case the  pivot\nof the prosecution is not accepted, a new prosecution case  cannot  be  made\nto imperil the defence.  The prosecution as well as the convict has a  right\nto adduce evidence to show aggravating grounds to impose  severe  punishment\nor mitigating circumstances to impose a lesser sentence.   More  so,  appeal\nis a continuity of trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1181980\" id=\"span_19\">32)   In <a href=\"/doc/1181980/\" id=\"a_88\">Akhtari Bi (Smt.) vs. State of M.P.</a>, AIR 2001 SC 1528,  this  Court\nexplained the nature of appeal observing as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">     “Appeal being a statutory right, the trial  court&#x27;s  verdict  does  not\n     attain finality during pendency of the appeal and for that purpose  his\n     trial is deemed to be continuing despite conviction”.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">33)   Needless to say that Appellate court has a  right  of  rehearing,  re-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_116\">appreciating the evidence and in exceptional circumstances even to permit  a\nparty to adduce additional evidence.

To\nconstitute a legal appreciation of evidence, the judgment should be such  as\nto indicate that the Court has applied its mind to it. Every portion of  the\njudgment must indicate application of mind by the Court to the  evidence  on\nrecord. The reason  for  the  decision  is  an  important  ingredient  of  a\njudgment. Compliance with the law  in  this  regard  should  not  be  merely\nformal but substantial and real, for it is this part of the  judgment  alone\nwhich enables  the  higher  Court  to  appreciate  the  correctness  of  the\ndecision, the parties to feel that  the  Court  has  fully  and  impartially\nconsidered their respective cases and the public to realise that  a  genuine\nand sincere attempt has been made to mete out even-handed justice.   Reasons\nform the substratum  of  the  decision  and  their  factual  accuracy  is  a\nguarantee that the Court has applied its mind to the evidence in  the  case.\nWhere the statement of reasons turned out to be a mere hollow pretension  of\na baseless claim of application of  mind  by  the  Court,  the  judgment  is\nrobbed of one of its most essential ingredients and forfeits  its  claim  to\nbe termed as judgment in the eyes of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_120\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1235094\" id=\"span_20\">37)   In <a href=\"/doc/1235094/\" id=\"a_89\">Bachan Singh vs. State of Punjab</a>,  AIR  1980  SC  898,  this  Court\nobserved:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">     “151…..Accordingly, sub-section (3)  of  <a href=\"/doc/1266667/\" id=\"a_90\">Section  354</a>  of  the  Cr.P.C.\n     provides:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">     “When the conviction is for an offence punishable with death or, in the\n     alternative, with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a  term  of\n     years, the judgment shall state the reasons for the  sentence  awarded,\n     and, in the case of sentence of death, the  special  reasons  for  such\n     sentence.”\n\n\n     “152. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1837051\" id=\"span_21\">In the context, we may also notice Section 235(2) of the Code  of\n     1973, because it  makes  not  only  explicit,  what  according  to  the\n     decision in <a href=\"/doc/1837051/\" id=\"a_91\">Jagmohan Singh vs. State  of  U.P.</a>  AIR  1973  SC  947  was\n     implicit in the scheme of the Code, but also bifurcates  the  trial  by\n     providing for two hearings, one at the pre-conviction stage and another\n     at the pre-sentence stage….”\n\n\n     …..By enacting Section 235(2) of the new Code, Parliament has  accepted\n     that recommendation of the Law Commission.

The Judge must make a genuine effort to elicit  from  the  accused\nall information which will eventually have a  bearing  on  the  question  of\nsentence. All admissible evidence is before  the  Judge  but  that  evidence\nitself often  furnishes  a  clue  to  the  genesis  of  the  crime  and  the\nmotivation of the criminal. It is the bounden duty of a Judge to cast  aside\nthe formalities of the court scene and approach  the  question  of  sentence\nfrom a broad,  sociological  point  of  view.

It is also clear that  passing  sentence  without  recording\nthe judgment  would  amount  to  illegality.

However,  the  Code,  particularly,\nSections 353, 354, 362 and 363 make it clear that how the judgment is to  be\nin a criminal trial, language and contents and the procedure to be  followed\nin furnishing copy of the judgment immediately after pronouncement.   It  is\nalso clear that the  ultimate  decision,  namely,  the  judgment,  shall  be\npronounced in the open court after the termination of  the  trial.   Section\n353(1) of the Code makes it clear that it is incumbent on the  part  of  the\nPresiding Officer to deliver the whole of the judgment  or  by  reading  out\nthe operative part of the judgment  and  explaining  the  substance  of  the\njudgment in a language which is understood by the accused  or  his  pleader.\nWe  have  already  referred  to  the  fact  that  the  blasts  occurred   on\n12.03.1993.

Thereafter,  CBI  was\nasked to investigate  further  on  19.11.1993  and  filed  19  supplementary\ncharge sheets.  Finally, on 10.04.1995, order framing  charges  was  passed.\nThereafter, recording of evidence  began  on  30.06.1995  by  examining  the\nfirst  prosecution  witness.

While A-1 was awarded death  sentence,  it  is  clear  from  the\nconclusion that he was apprised that sentence of death  awarded  to  him  is\nsubject to the confirmation by the Apex Court and he was also informed  that\nfor the said purpose the Court would be making necessary reference  to  Apex\nCourt within 30 days from the date of completion of passing of final  order.\n   In the same order, the Court has also apprised  A-1  that  it  will  take\nsome time to complete the pronouncement of the  final  order  of  conviction\nand sentence of remaining accused and completed the judgment by getting  the\nsame transcribed,  corrected  and  signed.   The  court  also  directed  the\nSheristedar to handover the ‘operative part’ of the  order  passed  on  both\nthese days, i.e., 12.09.2006 and 27.07.2007.

The trial, therefore, comes to an  end  only  after\n      the sentence is awarded to the convicted person.  It will thus be seen\n      from above provisions that after the court records a  conviction,  the\n      accused has to be heard on the question of sentence  and  it  is  only\n      after the sentence is awarded that the judgment becomes  complete  and\n      can be appealed against under <a href=\"/doc/989353/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 373</a>  of  the  CrPC.

A judgment becomes complete after both  these\n      stages are covered.”\n                                              (emphasis supplied)\n\nIt is clear that a conviction order is  not  a  “judgment”  as  contemplated\nunder Section 353 and that a judgment is pronounced only after the award  of\nsentence.  In  the  case  on  hand,  the  Designated  Judge  pronounced  the\noperative part of the judgment on 27.07.2007 and explained the substance  of\nthe judgment to  the  appellant  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of\nSection 353(1)(c) of the Code.  A perusal  of  the  final  judgment  of  the\nDesignated Court shows that the Designated Judge has dealt  with  the  issue\nof pronouncing the judgment under Section 353(1)(c) in detail.   In  para  5\nof Part 46 of  the  final  judgment,  the  Designated  Judge  explained  the\nreasons for pronouncing the judgment under Section 353(1)(c) of the Code  as\nfollows:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">      “5)   In the premises aforesaid but in light of 1)  events  which  had\n      occurred in past at trial, 2) keeping in mind attitude and conduct  of\n      accused as disclosed during course of trial, 3) mammoth subject matter\n      involved at trial i.e. charges framed thereon running  into  512  with\n      many of them containing in  all  192  sub  charges,  4)  delicacy  and\n      sensitivity of subject  matter  involved  at  trial  due  to  numerous\n      incidents involved and communal  conflict  said  to  be  involved,  5)\n      impact likely  to  be  caused  at/even  after  commencing  process  of\n      judgment within and even outside court precincts, 6) impact likely  to\n      be caused at/after declaration of final order, 7)  point  of  security\n      and safety of concerns attending during course of proceeding within or\n      even outside precincts of court and point of law and order within  the\n      City/State/Nation, 8) large number of 123 accused about whom  judgment\n      was to be declared, 9) necessity of  smoothly  completing  process  of\n      judgement by taking due care to prevent/avoid occurring of  any  event\n      causing disturbance, interruptions etc. during same vitiating  decorum\n      of court, it was proper to deliver judgement only in  accordance  with\n      provision of <a href=\"/doc/800016/\" id=\"a_121\">Sec. 353(1) (c)</a> of Cr.P.C. rather than adopting any other\n      prescribed mode for delivery  of  judgement.   Needless  to  add  that\n      following the other method was bound  to  result  trend  of  judgement\n      being known to accused prior to delivery of same and thus  giving  all\n      the chance to unscrupulous accused on  bail  to  flee  away  and  such\n      accused in custody  to  create  confusion/or  indulge  in  activities,\n      disrupting ongoing work and thereby defeating the process of law.  For\n      the  same  reason  it  was  also  felt  necessary  to  keep  judgement\n      computerized and contents thereof protected by putting password rather\n      than taking print out of the same.”\n                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_123\">48)    Since  we  have  completely  analyzed  the  method  follwed  by   the\nDesignated Judge, we are satisfied that the requirements  of  pronouncing  a\njudgment under Section 353(1)(c) of the Code have been fully complied  with.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_142\"> The above approach makes it clear  that  while  pronouncing  the  operative\npart of the judgment, the Designated Court ensured  that  the  substance  of\nthe judgment has been explained to the  appellant  in  compliance  with  the\nrequirement of Section 353.  It is also relevant to point out that the  said\norder dated 27.07.2007 was pronounced in open court and signed and dated  by\nthe Designated Judge  in  compliance  with  the  requirements  of  the  said\nsection.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_143\">49)   Regarding  the  requirement  of  providing  a  copy  of  the  judgment\nimmediately as required by the provisions of  Section  363,  the  Designated\nJudge in para 61 of Part 46 of the final judgment has dealt  with  the  same\nas follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_124\">      “Having regard to the same, the word used  “immediately”  in  sub-<a href=\"/doc/550192/\" id=\"a_122\">sec.\n      363 (1)</a> of Cr.P.C. will be required to be interpreted  in  context  of\n      subject matter involved in each of the  case.   In  short  in  a  case\n      involving such huge subject  matter  furnishing  of  such  copy  after\n      reasonable time after completion of passing of final order would never\n      be said to be an act offending provisions of law or defeating right of\n      accused.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">50)   We have already pointed out  that  this  was  a  joint  trial  of  123\naccused persons.  It is also brought to our notice  that  the  copy  of  the\nfinal judgment was  provided  free  of  cost  to  the  appellant  after  the\npronouncement of the orders with respect to  each  of  the  accused  by  the\nDesignated Judge.  Further, as is evident from para (j) of the  order  dated\n27.07.2007, the appellant was apprised of the fact that a copy of the  final\njudgment would  be  provided  after  completion  of  the  order  as  regards\nsentence in respect of the remaining accused.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">51)   As pointed out earlier, the trial at  the  Designated  Court  involved\n123 accused and findings were recorded for 512 charges and accordingly,  the\nprocess of pronouncing sentence in respect of  each  accused  and  apprising\nthe accused of the same could not have been completed in a day.   Thus,  the\nprocess of pronouncement of judgment had to be carried out for  all  accused\nsince it was a joint trial and accordingly a  copy  of  the  final  judgment\ncould be provided to each  of  the  accused  only  after  the  sentence  was\npronounced in respect of all the accused persons.  The judgment  also  shows\nthat detailed hearings on sentencing effectively  commenced  after  all  the\nconviction orders were pronounced and counsel for  the  appellant/appellants\nmade detailed submissions on it.  It is evident from  para  351  onwards  of\nPart 46 of the final judgment that detailed submissions  were  made  by  the\ncounsel by pointing out mitigating  factors  that  were  considered  by  the\nDesignated Judge while sentencing the appellant and  other  accused  at  the\ntrial.  It is also clear from the judgment that  detailed  submissions  were\nmade by the appellant  (A-1)  during  the  pre-sentence  hearing  and  these\nsubmissions were considered and, accordingly, reasons have been recorded  by\nthe Designated Judge in Part 46 of the final  judgment  in  compliance  with\nthe requirement of Section 235(2) and Section 353 of the Code.  It  is  also\nrelevant to mention that Section 354 makes it clear  that  ‘judgment’  shall\ncontain the punishment awarded to the accused.  It  is  therefore,  complete\nonly after sentence is determined.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\">52)   Section 354(1)(c) states that every judgment referred  to  in  Section\n353 “shall specify the offence of which,  and  the  section  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_123\">Indian\nPenal Code</a> (45 of 1860), or other law under which, the accused is  convicted\nand the punishment to which he is  sentenced.  In  view  of  the  same,  the\njudgment under  Section  353(1)(c)  is  to  be  pronounced  only  after  the\nsentence in a case where conviction is determined. The process  of  delivery\nof judgment includes  the  determination  of  guilt,  or  otherwise,  of  an\naccused and in the event of such guilt being established, also includes  the\nprocess of sentencing the accused.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">53)   In our case, it was pointed out that  the  judgment  was  reserved  on\n23.11.2003.  Till 2006, the Court proceeded to  formulate  its  reasons  and\nmake judicial determination  of  guilt  or  otherwise  in  respect  of  each\naccused.  The process of delivery of judgment commenced on  12.09.2006  when\nthe Court pronounced its verdict on  the  guilt  or  otherwise  of  specific\naccused.  Whilst doing so, the Designated Judge explained the  offences  for\nwhich the accused were being convicted and invited the  accused  persons  to\nmake their statements with reference to the  quantum  of  sentence.   It  is\nevident that at this  stage,  the  detailed  reasoning  may  not  have  been\nfinally communicated to the accused, but the determination of the  Court  as\nwell as the broad understanding of the operative part of  the  judgment  was\ncommunicated.  In case there is an objection on  the  part  of  the  accused\nregarding not knowing the reasons for his conviction, it contextually  means\nthat he had not been made aware as to the specific  pieces  of  evidence  or\nmarshalling of facts which led to his conviction.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\">54)   In view of the same, there is no illegality  or  irregularity  in  the\nprocess followed and specifically under Sections 353, 354  and  235  keeping\nin mind the magnitude of the task before the Designated  Judge  inasmuch  as\nhe was trying 123 accused persons and had to deliver a judgment  which  runs\nin about 4,300 pages.  In view of the above, we hold that the  pronouncement\nof the judgment was in compliance with the  above  said  provisions  of  the\nCode and does not violate any of the provisions of the Code as contended  by\nthe appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_145\">55)   It is also clear from the reasoning of the Designated  Court  that  by\nadopting the same procedure, the Designated Judge  conveyed  the  conclusion\nwith regard to various charges  leveled  against  other  accused  (convicted\ntotal accused 100) and also apprised each one  of  them  including  A-1  the\nreasoning and other materials for arriving at such a conclusion as  well  as\ntheir pleaders.  He also apprised that because  the  convicted  accused  are\n100 in number and the common judgment is running into  thousands  of  pages,\nit may require some time and as soon as  the  full  judgment  will  be  made\nready, the same will be supplied to them free of cost.   It  does  not  mean\nthat on the date of pronouncing the decision  (decision  was  pronounced  on\nvarious dates), the whole judgment was not ready or incomplete.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_146\">56)   As the Code mandates that  the  accused  are  entitled  to  full/whole\njudgment, unless the conclusion relating to all  the  convicted  accused  is\nread over and explained to them, opportunity  of  hearing  on  sentence  has\nbeen provided to them or their respective counsel and incorporation of  both\nthe conclusions relating to conviction and sentence has been done, the  same\ncannot be supplied to the accused.  Taking note of  the  number  of  persons\ninvolved, witnesses examined, documents marked/exhibited which  are  running\ninto thousands of pages, unless the full/whole judgment containing  all  the\ndetails, the same cannot be supplied to the accused.  In  other  words,  the\nsupplied copy of the judgment unless contains the  charges,  materials  both\noral and documentary relied on  by  the  prosecution,  discussion,  ultimate\nconclusion and the sentence,  the  same  cannot  be  treated  as  full/whole\njudgment in terms of the procedure prescribed under the Code.   Inasmuch  as\nall these factual aspects, particularly, the  peculiar  position  about  the\nnumber  of  accused  and  voluminous  oral  and  documentary  evidence,  the\nDesignated Judge not only apprised the accused regarding  the  offences  for\nwhich they were found to be guilty but also of  the  reasoning  adopted  and\nthe materials relied on by him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_147\">57)   It is also relevant to point out that on apprisal of various  offences\nfor which the accused were  found  to  be  guilty  before  hearing  all  the\naccused on sentence, their respective counsel took time for  filing  written\narguments, in fact, filed written submissions  on  various  dates  conveying\ntheir views to the Court.  It is also clear that  on  consideration  of  the\nobjections raised, the accused were  awarded  sentence  and  the  same  were\nultimately conveyed to all the accused.  It is not in dispute  that  neither\nthe decision relating to ultimate conviction nor the sentence could be  done\nin one day in respect of all the convicted  100  accused.   Undoubtedly,  it\nspread over to various dates and we are satisfied that the Designated  Court\ncompleted its task by passing  the  impugned  orders  keeping  in  mind  the\nprocedural aspects to be followed in terms of the Code (vide  Sections  353,\n354, 362, 363 etc.) and at the same time,  adhering  to  the  principles  of\nnatural justice and the valuable right of the accused under  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_124\">Article  21</a>  of\nthe Constitution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_148\">Whether the impugned judgment is in violation of Section 362 of the Code.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_149\">58)   It is also brought to our notice that several applications  were  made\nby various accused  persons  to  amend  the  conviction  orders  which  were\ndismissed as meritless by the Designated Court.   In  fact,  the  Designated\nCourt dismissed the applications for amending the conviction  orders  of  99\naccused persons.  Learned senior counsel for A-1  relied  upon  Section  362\nand contended that since judgment on sentence had not been  pronounced,  the\nDesignated Court could amend the conviction order to bring  all  convictions\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_125\">IPC</a> instead of convicting 99 accused persons under TADA.   In  the\nlight of the submissions made, we verified the records  and  impugned  final\njudgment, particularly, Part 46 and found that neither  A-1  nor  any  other\ncounsel pointed out the amendment, in particular,  that  would  attract  the\nprovisions of Section 362 of the  Code.   On  the  other  hand,  as  rightly\npointed out by  the  counsel  for  the  CBI,  there  is  no  alteration  and\namendment that has been made in the  judgment  after  its  pronouncement  as\nclaimed by the counsel for the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_150\">59)   The Code being essentially a code of procedure unlike  all  procedural\nlaws is designed to further the ends of justice and not  to  frustrate  them\nby the introduction of endless technicalities.  The object of  the  Code  is\nto ensure for the accused a full and  fair  trial  in  accordance  with  the\nprinciples  of  natural  justice.   From  the  materials  placed  and  after\nverification of the decision, apprisal of the accused about the contents  of\nthe  judgment,  hearing  all  the  accused  and  their  pleaders   regarding\nsentence, we are satisfied that the Designated Court has complied  with  the\nrequirements  of  law  and  we  are  also  satisfied  that  considering  the\nvoluminous nature of work, even if there  is  mere  procedural  irregularity\nthat would not vitiate the trial or the ultimate conclusion unless the  same\nresults in miscarriage of justice.   We  are  satisfied  that  the  impugned\njudgment and procedure followed and adopted by the Designated Court  fulfill\nthe mandate of the Code and there is  neither  violation  of  principles  of\nnatural justice  nor  breach  of  <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_126\">Article  21</a>  of  the  Constitution.   Even\notherwise, taking note of the fact that present appeals are the only  remedy\nfor the appellants, we heard the counsel at  length,  perused  and  analysed\nall the oral and documentary evidence running into several  volumes.   Every\nopportunity was  granted  to  all  the  counsel  and  all  the  issues  were\nconsidered without any restriction.   Accordingly, we reject the  contention\nraised by learned senior counsel for the appellant.\nConspiracy\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_151\">60)   Chapter VA of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_127\">IPC</a> speaks  about  Criminal  Conspiracy.

It is important to  notice  the  Objects  and  Reasons  of  the  said\namendment to understand that the underlying purpose of  introducing  Section\n120-A was to make a mere agreement to do an illegal act or an act  which  is\nnot illegal by illegal means, punishable.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_152\">Objects and Reasons are as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">      “The sections of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_128\">Indian Penal Code</a> which deal  directly  with  the\n      subject of conspiracy are those contained in Chapter V and Section 121-\n      A of the Code.  Under the  latter  provision,  it  is  an  offence  to\n      conspire to commit any of the offences punishable by  <a href=\"/doc/786750/\" id=\"a_129\">Section  121</a>  of\n      the  Indian  Penal  Code  or  to  conspire  to  deprive  the  King  of\n      sovereignty of British India or any part  thereof  or  to  overawe  by\n      means of criminal force or show of criminal force  the  Government  of\n      India or any Local Government and to  constitute  a  conspiracy  under\n      this Section. It is not necessary that any  act  or  illegal  omission\n      should take place in pursuance thereof.  Under Section  107,  abetment\n      includes engaging with one or more person or persons in any conspiracy\n      for the doing of a thing, if an act or illegal omission takes place in\n      pursuance of that conspiracy, and in order to the doing of that thing.\n       In other words, except in respect of the offences  particularized  in\n      Section 121-A conspiracy per se is not an  offence  under  the  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_130\">Indian\n      Penal Code</a>.”\n\n\n      “On the other hand, by the common law  of  England,  if  two  or  more\n      persons agree together to do  anyting  contrary  to  law,  or  to  use\n      unlawful means  in  the  carrying  out  of  an  object  not  otherwise\n      unlawful, the persons, who so agree, commit the offence of conspiracy.\n       In other words, conspiracy in England may be defined as an  agreement\n      of two or more persons to do an unlawful act or to do a lawful act  by\n      unlawful means, and the parties to such a  conspiracy  are  liable  to\n      indictment.”\n\n\n      “Experience has shown that dangerous conspiracies  have  entered  into\n      India which have for their object aims other than  the  commission  of\n      the offences specified in <a href=\"/doc/1949191/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 121-A</a> of the Indian Penal  Code  and\n      that the existing law is inadequate to deal  with  modern  conditions.\n      The present Bill is designed  to  assimilate  the  provisions  of  the\n      <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_132\">Indian Penal Code</a> to those of the  English  law  with  the  additional\n      safeguard that in the case of a conspiracy other than a conspiracy  to\n      commit an offence some overt act is necessary to bring the  conspiracy\n      within the purview of the  criminal  law.   The  Bill  makes  criminal\n      conspiracy a substantive offence, and when such  a  conspiracy  is  to\n      commit an offence punishable with death,  or  rigourous  imprisonement\n      for a term of two years or upwards, and no express provision  is  made\n      in the Code, provides a punishment of the same nature  as  that  which\n      might be awarded for the abetment of such an offence.   In  all  other\n      cases  of  criminal  conspiracy   the   punishment   contemplated   is\n      imprisonment of either description for a term not exceeding six months\n      or with fine, or with both.”\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">4</span>\n\n\n5 Prior to the amendment of the Code and the introduction of Sections 120-A\nand B, the doctrine of agency was applicable to ascertain the liability  of\nthe conspirators, however, conspiracy in itself was not an offence  (except\nfor certain offences).  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"342903\" id=\"span_35\">The amendment made conspiracy a substantive offence\nand rendered the mere agreement to commit an offence punishable.  Prior  to\nthe amendment, unless an  overt  act  took  place  in  furtherance  of  the\nconspiracy it was not indictable (it would become indictable by  virtue  of\nbeing abetment).  The proposition that the mere agreement  constitutes  the\noffence has been accepted by this Court in  several  judgments.   Reference\nmay be made to <a href=\"/doc/342903/\" id=\"a_133\">Major E.G. Barsay vs. State  of  Bombay</a>  (1962)  2  SCR  195\nwherein this Court held that the the gist of the offence is an agreement to\nbreak the law. The parties to such an agreement will be guilty of  criminal\nconspiracy, though the illegal act agreed to be done has not been done.  It\nis not an ingredient of the offence that all the parties should agree to do\na single illegal act.  It may comprise the commission of a number of  acts.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_153\">The Court has held as under:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">      “31….<a href=\"/doc/591631/\" id=\"a_134\">Section  120-A</a>  of  the  Indian  Penal  Code  defines   “criminal\n      conspiracy” and under that definition, “When two or more persons agree\n      to do, or cause to be done, an illegal act, or an  act  which  is  not\n      illegal by illegal means, such an agreement is designated  a  criminal\n      conspiracy.”The gist of the offence is an agreement to break the  law.\n      The  parties  to  such  an  agreement  will  be  guilty  of   criminal\n      conspiracy, though the illegal act agreed to  be  done  has  not  been\n      done. So too, it is not an ingredient of  the  offence  that  all  the\n      parties should agree to do a single illegal act. It may  comprise  the\n      commission of a number of acts. Under <a href=\"/doc/704346/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 43</a> of the  Indian  Penal\n      Code, an act would be illegal  if  it  is  an  offence  or  if  it  is\n      prohibited by law. Under the first charge the accused are charged with\n      having conspired to do three categories of illegal acts, and the  mere\n      fact that all of them could not be convicted separately in respect  of\n      each of the offences has no  relevancy  in  considering  the  question\n      whether the offence of conspiracy has been  committed.  They  are  all\n      guilty of the offence of conspiracy to do  illegal  acts,  though  for\n      individual offences all of them may not be liable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">Theory of Agency and Conspiracy\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">62)   An important facet of the Law of Conspiracy is that apart from  it\nbeing a distinct offence, all conspirators are liable for  the  acts  of\neach other of the crime or crimes which have been committed as a  result\nof the conspiracy. This principle has been  recognized  right  from  the\nearly judgment in Regina vs. Murphy (1873)  173  ER  502.  In  the  said\njudgment Coleridge J. while summing up for the Jury stated as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">      “...I am bound to tell you, that although the  common  design  is  the\n      root of the charge, it is  not  necessary  to  prove  that  these  two\n      parties came together and actually agreed in terms to have this common\n      design and to pursue it by comroeff means, and so  to  carry  it  into\n      execution. This is not necessary, because in many cases  of  the  most\n      clearly established conspiracies there are no  means  of  proving  any\n      such thing and neither law nor common sense requires that it should be\n      proved. If you find that these two persons pursued by their  acts  the\n      same object, often by the same means, one performing one  part  of  an\n      act, so as to complete it, with a view to the attainment of the object\n      which they  were  pursuing,  you  will  be  at  liberty  to  draw  the\n      conclusion that they have been engaged in a conspiracy to effect  that\n      object. The question you have to ask yourselves  is,  &#x27;Had  they  this\n      common design, and did they pursue it by  these  common  means  —  the\n      design being unlawful?&#x27; it is not necessary that it should  be  proved\n      that these defendants met to concoct this scheme, nor is it  necessary\n      that they should have  originated  it.  If  a  conspiracy  be  already\n      formed, and a person joins it afterwards, he is  equally  guilty.  You\n      are to say whether, from the acts  that  have  been  proved,  you  are\n      satisfied that these defendants were acting in concertin this  matter.\n      If you are satisfied that there was concert between them, I  am  bound\n      to say that being convinced of the conspiracy,  it  is  not  necessary\n      that you should find both  Mr.  Murphy  and  Mr.  Douglas  doing  each\n      particular act, as after the fact of conspiracy is already established\n      in your minds, whatever is either  said  or  done  by  either  of  the\n      defendants in pursuance of the common design, is, both in law  and  in\n      common sense, to be considered as the acts of both.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">63)   Each conspirator can  be  attributed  each  others  actions  in  a\nconspiracy. Theory of agency applies and this rule existed even prior to\nthe amendment of the Penal Code in India.

The\nCourt held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">      “583. Some of the broad principles governing the law of conspiracy may\n      be summarized though,  as  the  name  implies,  a  summary  cannot  be\n      exhaustive of the principles.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">      1. Under <a href=\"/doc/591631/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 120-A</a> IPC offence of criminal conspiracy is committed\n      when two or more persons agree to do or cause to be  done  an  illegal\n      act or legal act by illegal means. When it is a legal act  by  illegal\n      means overt act is necessary. Offence of  criminal  conspiracy  is  an\n      exception to the general law where intent alone  does  not  constitute\n      crime. It is intention to commit crime and joining hands with  persons\n      having the same intention. Not only the intention but there has to  be\n      agreement to carry out the  object  of  the  intention,  which  is  an\n      offence. The question for consideration in  a  case  is  did  all  the\n      accused have the intention and  did  they  agree  that  the  crime  be\n      committed. It would not be enough for the offence of  conspiracy  when\n      some of the accused merely entertained a wish, howsoever horrendous it\n      may be, that offence be committed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">      2. Acts subsequent to the achieving of the object  of  conspiracy  may\n      tend to prove that a particular accused was party to  the  conspiracy.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\">      Once the object of conspiracy has been achieved, any  subsequent  act,\n      which may be unlawful, would not  make  the  accused  a  part  of  the\n      conspiracy like giving shelter to an absconder.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_158\">      3. Conspiracy is hatched in  private  or  in  secrecy.  It  is  rarely\n      possible to establish a conspiracy by direct evidence.  Usually,  both\n      the existence of the conspiracy and its objects have  to  be  inferred\n      from the circumstances and the conduct of the accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_159\">      4. Conspirators may for example, be enrolled in a chain-  A  enrolling\n      B, B enrolling C, and so on; and all  will  be  members  of  a  single\n      conspiracy if they so intend and agree, even though each member  knows\n      only the person who enrolled him and the person whom he enrols.  There\n      may be a kind of umbrella-spoke enrolment, where a  single  person  at\n      the center does the enrolling and all the other members are unknown to\n      each other, though they know that there are to be other members. These\n      are theories and in  practice  it  may  be  difficult  to  tell  which\n      conspiracy in a particular case falls  into  which  category.  It  may\n      however, even overlap.  But  then  there  has  to  be  present  mutual\n      interest. Persons may be members of single conspiracy even though each\n      is ignorant of the identity of many others who may have diverse  roles\n      to play. It is not a part of the crime  of  conspiracy  that  all  the\n      conspirators need to agree to play the same or an active role.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_160\">      5. When two or more persons agree to commit  a  crime  of  conspiracy,\n      then regardless of making or considering any plans for its commission,\n      and despite the fact that no step is taken by any such person to carry\n      out their common purpose, a crime is committed by each and  every  one\n      who joins in the agreement. There has thus to be two conspirators  and\n      there may be more than that. To prove the charge of conspiracy  it  is\n      not necessary that intended crime was committed or not.  If  committed\n      it may further help prosecution to prove the charge of conspiracy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_161\">      6. It is not necessary that  all  conspirators  should  agree  to  the\n      common purpose at the same time. They may join with other conspirators\n      at any time before the consummation of the intended objective, and all\n      are equally responsible. What part each conspirator is to play may not\n      be known to everyone or the fact as to when a conspirator  joined  the\n      conspiracy and when he left.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_162\">      7. A charge of conspiracy may prejudice the accused because it  forces\n      them into a joint trial and the court may consider the entire mass  of\n      evidence against every accused. Prosecution has  to  produce  evidence\n      not only to show that each of the accused has knowledge of the  object\n      of conspiracy but also of the agreement. In the charge  of  conspiracy\n      the court has to guard itself against the danger of unfairness to  the\n      accused. Introduction of evidence  against  some  may  result  in  the\n      conviction of all, which is to be avoided. By  means  of  evidence  in\n      conspiracy, which is otherwise inadmissible in the trial of any  other\n      substantive offence prosecution tries to  implicate  the  accused  not\n      only in the conspiracy itself but also in the substantive crime of the\n      alleged conspirators.  There  is  always  difficulty  in  tracing  the\n      precise contribution of each member of the conspiracy but  then  there\n      has to be cogent and convincing  evidence  against  each  one  of  the\n      accused charged with the offence of conspiracy. As observed  by  Judge\n      Learned  Hand  “this  distinction  is  important   today   when   many\n      prosecutors seek to sweep within the dragnet of conspiracy  all  those\n      who have  been  associated  in  any  degree  whatever  with  the  main\n      offenders”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">      8.  As  stated  above  it  is  the  unlawful  agreement  and  not  its\n      accomplishment,  which  is  the  gist  or  essence  of  the  crime  of\n      conspiracy. Offence of criminal conspiracy  is  complete  even  though\n      there is no agreement as to the means by which the purpose  is  to  be\n      accomplished. It is the unlawful agreement which is  the  gravamen  of\n      the crime of conspiracy. The unlawful agreement  which  amounts  to  a\n      conspiracy need not be formal or express, but may be inherent  in  and\n      inferred from the circumstances,  especially  declarations,  acts  and\n      conduct of the conspirators. The agreement need not be entered into by\n      all the parties to it  at  the  same  time,  but  may  be  reached  by\n      successive actions evidencing their joining of the conspiracy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_164\">      9. It has been said that a criminal conspiracy  is  a  partnership  in\n      crime, and that there is in each conspiracy a joint or  mutual  agency\n      for the prosecution of a common plan. Thus, if  two  or  more  persons\n      enter into a conspiracy, any act done by any of them pursuant  to  the\n      agreement is, in contemplation of law, the act of  each  of  them  and\n      they are jointly responsible therefore.  This  means  that  everything\n      said, written or done by any  of  the  conspirators  in  execution  or\n      furtherance of the common purpose is deemed to have been said, done or\n      written by each of them. And this  joint  responsibility  extends  not\n      only to what is done by  any  of  the  conspirators  pursuant  to  the\n      original agreement but also  to  collateral  acts  incidental  to  and\n      growing out of the original purpose. A conspirator is not responsible,\n      however, for acts done by a co-conspirator after  termination  of  the\n      conspiracy. The joinder of a conspiracy  by  a  new  member  does  not\n      create a new conspiracy nor does it change the  status  of  the  other\n      conspirators, and the mere fact that conspirators individually  or  in\n      groups perform different tasks to a common end does  not  split  up  a\n      conspiracy into several different conspiracies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_165\">      10. A man may join a conspiracy by word or by deed. However,  criminal\n      responsibility for a conspiracy requires more than  a  merely  passive\n      attitude towards an existing conspiracy. One who commits an overt  act\n      with knowledge of the  conspiracy  is  guilty.  And  one  who  tacitly\n      consents to the object of a  conspiracy  and  goes  along  with  other\n      conspirators, actually standing by while the others put the conspiracy\n      into effect, is guilty though he intends to take no active part in the\n      crime.”\n\n\n                                                 (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_166\">64)   The offence under Section 120B is a crime between the parties to do  a\nparticular act.  Association or relation to lead conspiracy  is  not  enough\nto establish the intention to kill the  deceased.   To  make  it  clear,  to\nbring home the charge of conspiracy within the ambit of Section 120B, it  is\nnecessary to establish that there was an agreement between the  parties  for\ndoing an unlawful act.  It is difficult to establish  conspiracy  by  direct\nevidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_167\">65)   Since conspiracy is hatched in secrecy, to bring home  the  charge  of\nconspiracy, it is relevant to decide conclusively the object behind it  from\nthe charges leveled against the accused and the  facts  of  the  case.   The\nobject behind it is the ultimate  aim  of  the  conspiracy.   Further,  many\nmeans might have been adopted to achieve this ultimate  object.   The  means\nmay even constitute different offences by themselves, but as  long  as  they\nare adopted to achieve the ultimate object of the conspiracy, they are  also\nacts of conspiracy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"928322\" id=\"span_39\">66)   In <a href=\"/doc/928322/\" id=\"a_141\">Ajay Aggarwal vs. Union of India</a>, AIR  1993  SC  1637,  this  Court\nrejected the submission of the accused that as he was staying in  Dubai  and\nthe conspiracy was initially hatched in Chandigarh and he did  not  play  an\nactive part in the commission of the  acts  which  ultimately  lead  to  the\nincident, thus, could not be liable for any offence, observing:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">      “8…..<a href=\"/doc/591631/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 120-A</a> of the IPC defines ‘conspiracy’ to mean  that  when\n      two or more persons agree to do, or cause to be done an  illegal  act,\n      or an act which is not illegal by illegal means, such an agreement  is\n      designated as “criminal conspiracy”. No agreement except an  agreement\n      to commit an offence shall amount to  a  criminal  conspiracy,  unless\n      some act besides the agreement is done by one or more parties to  such\n      agreement in furtherance thereof. <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 120-B</a> of the IPC  prescribes\n      punishment for criminal conspiracy. It  is  not  necessary  that  each\n      conspirator must  know  all  the  details  of  the  scheme  nor  be  a\n      participant at every stage. It is necessary that they should agree for\n      design or object of the conspiracy. Conspiracy is conceived as  having\n      three elements: (1) agreement (2) between two or more persons by  whom\n      the agreement is effected; and (3) a criminal  object,  which  may  be\n      either the ultimate aim of the agreement, or may constitute the means,\n      or one of the means by which that aim is to  be  accomplished.  It  is\n      immaterial whether this is found in the ultimate objects.  The  common\n      law definition of ‘criminal  conspiracy’  was  stated  first  by  Lord\n      Denman in Jones case (1832) that an  indictment  for  conspiracy  must\n      “charge a conspiracy to do an unlawful act by unlawful means…..”\n\nThe Court, thus, held that an agreement between two or more  persons  to  do\nan illegal act or  legal  act  by  illegal  means  is  criminal  conspiracy.\nConspiracy itself is a substantive offence and is distinct from the  offence\nto be committed, for which the conspiracy was entered  into.   A  conspiracy\nis a continuing offence and continues to subsist and is  committed  wherever\none of the conspirators does an act or  series  of  acts.  So  long  as  its\nperformance continues, it is a continuing offence till  it  is  executed  or\nrescinded or frustrated by choice or necessity. A crime is complete as  soon\nas the agreement is made, but it is not a thing of the moment. It  does  not\nend with the making of the agreement.

Things said or done by conspirator in reference to common design--\n      Where there is reasonable ground to believe that two or  more  persons\n      have conspired together to commit an offence or an  actionable  wrong,\n      anything said, done or written by any one of such persons in reference\n      to their common intention, after the  time  when  such  intention  was\n      first entertained by any one of them, is a relevant  fact  as  against\n      each of the persons believed to so conspiring, as well for the purpose\n      of proving the existence of the  conspiracy  as  for  the  purpose  of\n      showing that any such person was a party to it.”\n\n\n      Illustrations\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\">      (i)   Reasonable ground exists for believing that A has  joined  in  a\n      conspiracy to wage war against the Government of India.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_172\">      (ii)  The facts that B procured arms in Europe for the purpose of  the\n      conspiracy, C collected  money  in  Calcutta  for  a  like  object,  D\n      persuaded persons to  join  the  conspiracy  in  Bombay,  E  published\n      writings advocating the object in view at Agra, and F transmitted from\n      Delhi to G at Kabul the money which C had collected at  Calcutta,  and\n      the contents of a letter  written  by  H  giving  an  account  of  the\n      conspiracy, are each relevant, both to  prove  the  existence  of  the\n      conspiracy, and to prove A&#x27; s complicity in it, although he  may  have\n      been ignorant of all of them, and although the persons  by  whom  they\n      were done were strangers to him, and  although  they  may  have  taken\n      place before he joined the conspiracy or after he left it.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_171\">It is to be seen that there are three conditions in  the  Section.  One  is,\nbefore utilizing the section for admitting certain  statements  of  the  co-\naccused from a confession, there should be a reasonable  ground  to  believe\nthat two or more persons have conspired together to commit an offence or  an\nactionable wrong.  According to this Section, only when  this  condition  is\nsatisfied in  a  given  case,  then  only  the  question  of  utilizing  the\nstatement  of  an  accused  against  the  co-accused  can  be   taken   into\nconsideration. Thus, as per Section 10, the following principles are  agreed\nupon unanimously:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_173\">   1. There shall be prima facie evidence affording a reasonable ground  for\n      the Court to  believe  that  two  or  more  persons  were  part  of  a\n      conspiracy to commit a wrongful act or offence;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_174\">   2. Once this condition was fulfilled, anything said, done or  written  by\n      any of its members, in reference to their common  intention,  will  be\n      considered as evidence against other co-conspirators;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_175\">   3. This fact would  be  evidence  for  the  purpose  of  existence  of  a\n      conspiracy and that the persons were a part of such conspiracy.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_172\">79)   This Court, in Nalini (supra), observed as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_176\">(a)   Justice Thomas (para 106-113)\nTheory of Agency, according to him, is the basic principle which  underlines\n<a href=\"/doc/1946503/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 10</a> of the Evidence Act.   He  says  that  the  first  condition  for\napplication of Section  10  is  “reasonable  ground  to  believe”  that  the\nconspirators have conspired together based  on  prima  facie  evidence.   If\nthis condition is fulfilled,  anything  said  by  any  of  the  conspirators\nbecomes substantive  evidence  for  the  purpose  of  corroboration  if  the\nstatement is in reference to their common  intention  (This  is  much  wider\nthan its English counterpart which uses the  expression  in  furtherance  of\nthe common object).  The arrest  of  a  conspirator  will  not  cut-off  his\nconnection with the conspiracy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_177\">(b)   Justice Wadhwa concurring, (para 575-581)\nHe was of the opinion that before considering the principle  of  Section  10\nand applying  it  to  the  facts  and  circumstances,  it  is  necessary  to\nascertain the period of conspiracy because  any  statement  made  before  or\nafter the conspiracy is thatched will not be admissible under the  aforesaid\nsection.  It would also be relevant against a person  who  entered  or  left\nthe time frame during the existence of conspiracy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_178\">(c)   Justice Wadhwa (para 663-665)\nTwo conditions are to be followed:- firstly, reasonable  ground  to  believe\nconspiracy,  and  secondly,  conspiracy  is  to  commit  an  offence  or  an\nactionable wrong.  If both the conditions exist, then anything said or  done\ncan be used as a relevant fact against one another, to prove  the  existence\nof conspiracy and that the person was a part to it.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_179\">80)   In the case on hand, the first condition for applying  <a href=\"/doc/1946503/\" id=\"a_165\">Section  10</a>  of\nthe Evidence Act is satisfied by the evidence of PWs 1  and  2  (approvers).\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_173\">There  are  77  confessions  in  this  case  which  are  voluntary  and  are\ncorroborated with the other circumstances of the  case.   These  confessions\ncontain statements inculpating the makers as  well  as  the  co-accused.   A\ncommon charge of conspiracy  was  framed  against  all  the  co-conspirators\nincluding A-1.  This is evident from  the  charges  framed  by  the  Special\nJudge which we have already extracted.  On all the  aforesaid  charges,  the\nappellant was found  guilty  by  the  Designated  Court.   The  evidence  in\nrespect of A-1 is in the nature of the confessions made  by  the  co-accused\npersons, the testimony of prosecution witnesses and documentary evidence  on\nrecord.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_174\">81)   The law on the issue emerges to  the  effect  that  conspiracy  is  an\nagreement between two or more persons to do an illegal act or an  act  which\nis not illegal by illegal means.  The object behind  the  conspiracy  is  to\nachieve the ultimate aim of conspiracy. In order  to  achieve  the  ultimate\nobject, parties may adopt many means. Such means  may  constitute  different\noffences by themselves, but so long as  they  are  adopted  to  achieve  the\nultimate object of the conspiracy, they are also acts of conspiracy. For  an\noffence of conspiracy, it is not necessary  for  the  prosecution  to  prove\nthat conspirators expressly agreed to do an illegal act, the  agreement  may\nbe proved by necessary implication. It  is  also  not  necessary  that  each\nmember of the conspiracy should know all  the  details  of  the  conspiracy.\nConspiracy is a continuing offence. Thus,  if  any  act  or  omission  which\nconstitutes an offence is done  in  India  or  outside  its  territory,  the\nconspirators continue to be the parties to the  conspiracy.  The  conspiracy\nmay be a general one and a smaller  one  which  may  develop  in  successive\nstages.  It is an unlawful agreement and not its  accomplishment,  which  is\nthe gist/essence of the crime of conspiracy. In order to  determine  whether\nthe conspiracy was hatched,  the  court  is  required  to  view  the  entire\nagreement and to find out as in fact what the conspirators intended to do.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_175\">82)   Mr. Jaspal Singh, learned senior counsel for A-1, submitted that  from\nthe evidence of PW-2 (Approver), it is evident that  various  meetings  were\nheld on and from 02.02.1993 till 11.03.1993 at various places in and  around\nBombay.  By taking us through the entire  evidence  of  PW-2,  he  submitted\nthat neither  PW-2  nor  any  other  co-accused  nor  even  any  independent\nwitness/evidence spoken to about the role of A-1 either being aware  of  the\nsaid meetings or being present in them or having any  knowledge  about  what\nconspired  in  the  said  meetings.   Though  learned  senior  counsel   has\nvehemently contended that A-1 was neither involved in arranging for  landing\nof arms and ammunitions nor in conducting surveys and choosing  targets  nor\nin filling vehicles with RDX and  arms  nor  in  the  meeting  held  at  Al-\nHussaini building, the specific instances as stated by  various  prosecution\nwitnesses amply prove his involvement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_176\">83)   Apart from the evidence of PW-2,  several  accused  persons  in  their\nconfessional statements and other witnesses examined  on  the  side  of  the\nprosecution clearly implicate A-1 and his  involvement  in  all  the  events\nwhich we are going to discuss under various heads.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">84)   It also emerged from  the  prosecution  evidence  that  conspiratorial\nmeetings were also held on 06.01.1993 at Hotel Parsian Darbar, Panvel  which\nwere attended by A-136, A-90, A-102, A-134 and Md.  Dosa,  (AA),  middle  of\nJanuary, 1993 at Dubai attended by A-14 and  Tiger  Memon  (AA)  and  Dawood\nIbrahim (AA) leading to the landing of arms and ammunitions at  Dighi  Jetty\nand Shekhadi.  These meetings formed the genesis of the  conspiracy  and  it\nwas at these meetings that meeting  of  minds  occurred  and  knowledge  was\nobtained by  the  co-conspirators  and  their  intention  was  expressed  to\nfurther the cause  of  the  said  conspiracy.   Since  we  have  elaborately\ndiscussed the constituents relating to the conspiracy, there is no  need  to\nrefer to the same in subsequent appeals before us.  It is also evident  that\na common charge of conspiracy was framed against all  the  accused  persons.\nIn view of the above, we are  satisfied  that  the  prosecution  has  placed\nsufficient acceptable materials to prove the  charge  of  conspiracy  beyond\nreasonable doubt which we will analyse in the later part of our judgment.\nConfession\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_178\">85)   In this heading, we have to consider the confession  made  by  accused\nand co-accused persons relied on by the prosecution.  Before going into  the\nacceptability or otherwise and merits of the claim made by both the  parties\nrelating to the confession of the accused and co-accused, it  is  useful  to\nrefer to the relevant provisions of the Code as well as TADA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_179\">86)   <a href=\"/doc/228024/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 164</a> of the Code  speaks  about  recording  of  confession  and\nstatement which is as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_180\">      “164.

It is his submission  that  the\n      words “co-accused”, etc. were included by the 1993 Amendment  of  TADA\n      by way of abundant caution and not because the  unamended  section  of\n      TADA did not cover the confession of the co-accused. According to  the\n      learned Senior Counsel, the phrase “shall be admissible in  the  trial\n      of such person” does not restrict the admissibility only  against  the\n      maker of the confession. It extends to all those who are  being  tried\n      jointly along with the maker of the confession provided they are  also\n      affected by the confession. The learned Senior Counsel highlights  the\n      crucial words “in the trial  of  such  person”  and  argues  that  the\n      confession would not merely be admissible against the maker but  would\n      be admissible in the trial of the maker which may be a  trial  jointly\n      with the other accused persons. Our attention has been  drawn  to  the\n      provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_257\">CrPC</a> and POTA providing for a joint trial in  which  the\n      accused could be tried not only for the offences under POTA  but  also\n      for the offences under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_258\">IPC</a>. We find no  difficulty  in  accepting  the\n      proposition that there could be a joint trial and the expression  “the\n      trial of such person” may encompass a trial in which the  accused  who\n      made the confession is tried jointly  with  the  other  accused.  From\n      that, does it follow that  the  confession  made  by  one  accused  is\n      equally admissible against others, in the absence of  specific  words?\n      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"905055\" id=\"span_87\">The answer, in our view, should be in the negative. On a plain reading\n      of Section 32(1), the confession made by an accused  before  a  police\n      officer shall be admissible against the maker of the confession in the\n      course of his trial. It may be a joint trial  along  with  some  other\n      accused; but, we cannot stretch the language of the section so  as  to\n      bring  the  confession  of  the  co-accused   within   the   fold   of\n      admissibility. Such stretching of the language of law is  not  at  all\n      warranted especially in the case of a law which visits a  person  with\n      serious penal consequences [vide the observations of Ahmadi, J. (as he\n      then was) in <a href=\"/doc/905055/\" id=\"a_259\">Niranjan Singh v. Jitendra</a>, SCC  at  p.  86,  which  were\n      cited with approval in Kartar Singh case].  We  would  expect  a  more\n      explicit and transparent wording to be employed in the section to rope\n      in the confession of the co-accused within the net of admissibility on\n      a par with the confession of the maker. An evidentiary  rule  of  such\n      importance and grave consequence to the accused could  not  have  been\n      conveyed in a deficient language. It seems  to  us  that  a  conscious\n      departure was made by the framers of POTA on a  consideration  of  the\n      pros and cons, by dropping the words “co-accused”, etc. These specific\n      words consciously added to <a href=\"/doc/38700231/\" id=\"a_260\">Section 15(1)</a> by the 1993 Amendment of TADA\n      so as to cover the  confessions  of  the  co-accused  would  not  have\n      escaped the notice of Parliament when POTA  was  enacted.</span>  Apparently,\n      Parliament in its wisdom would have thought that the law  relating  to\n      confession of the co-accused  under  the  ordinary  law  of  evidence,\n      should be allowed to have its sway, taking a cue from the observations\n      in Kartar Singh case at para  255.  The  confession  recorded  by  the\n      police officer was, therefore, allowed to be used against the maker of\n      the  confession  without  going  further  and  transposing  the  legal\n      position that was obtained  under  TADA.  We  cannot  countenance  the\n      contention that the words “co-accused”, etc.  were  added  in  <a href=\"/doc/38700231/\" id=\"a_261\">Section\n      15(1)</a> of TADA, ex majore cautela.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_239\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1474517\" id=\"span_88\">102)  In <a href=\"/doc/1474517/\" id=\"a_262\">Harjit Singh vs. State of Punjab</a> (2011) 4 SCC 441, at para  14,  it\nwas held:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_240\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1039202\" id=\"span_89\">“14…..However, the submission is not acceptable as  it  is  a  settled\n      legal proposition that a penal provision providing for  enhancing  the\n      sentence does not operate retrospectively.

The  writings  mentioned  on  the\nsaid two chits corroborate the figures given by  A-97  in  his  confessional\nstatement. The amounts deposited/withdrawn on the said two chits if seen  in\nlight of confessional statements of co-accused, i.e., A-10,  A-26  and  A-46\nwere the amounts deposited/withdrawn by accused Tiger Memon through his  men\non various dates.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_213\">108)   A  perusal  of  the  above  recitals  in  the  form  of  confessional\nstatements clearly establish the fact that Tiger had an  account  with  A-97\nin which various amounts totaling to Rs. 161.48 lakhs were deposited  by  A-\n26 at the behest of Tiger Memon (AA) and which was also being controlled  by\nA-1.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_214\">109)  On 12.02.1993, at the time of departure to Dubai, Tiger Memon told  A-\n10 that he should remain in touch with A-1 and in case of need of  money  to\nA-1, arrange the same from A-97.  Tiger Memon further  asked  him  to  bring\nRs. 5 lakhs from A-97 and to pay the same to Sharif Abdul  Gafoor  Parkar  @\nDadabhai (A-17) on account of landing charges.  Accordingly, A-10  alongwith\nParvez Nazir Ahmed Shaikh (A-12) brought the money from A-97 and paid it  to\nA-17 at his residence.  From the above, it can safely be inferred  that  the\naccount maintained with A-97 by Tiger Memon was being used for  meeting  the\nexpenses incurred for achieving the objects of criminal conspiracy  and  A-1\nwas handling it through other co-conspirators.  Confessional  statements  of\nA-10, A-11 and A-46 clearly reveal that  the  relevant  role  of  collecting\nmoney was played by A-10 at the behest of A-1.  In  the  said  context,  the\nmaterial contained in the confession of A-10 that Tiger Memon while  leaving\nfor Dubai had told him to remain in touch with A-1 and having  further  said\nthat in the event of A-1 requiring any money  then  he  should  collect  the\nsame from A-97 clearly reveals that A-1 himself  having  not  collected  the\nmoney from A-97 but he was handling  it  through  other  conspirators.   The\nsaid matter is further clear from the confession of A-10 which reveals  that\nwhen A-1 told him to bring an amount of Rs. 1 crore from  A-97,  the  manner\nin which the said amount was brought by A-10 by going to the house  of  A-97\nalong with A-11, A-12 and two more persons.  The further  materials  in  the\nconfession of A-10 regarding the transaction of Rs.  25  lakhs  and  Rs.  10\nlakhs effected on 09.03.1993 clearly  reveals  that  the  account  of  Tiger\nMemon was operated by A-1 through  A-10.   The  same  is  also  clear  after\nconsidering  the  manner  in  which  the  transaction  had  taken  place  on\n10.03.1993 by A-1.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_215\">110)   It has come in the confessional statement of A-67 that A-1 had  asked\nhim to book air-tickets for Dubai, and he agreed to do  the  same.   It  has\nalso come in the confession of A-67 that he had booked around 10-12  tickets\nfor Dubai at the instance of A-1 and A-46 used to bring the  money  for  the\nsame.  From the above, it is evident that A-67 agreed to  book  the  tickets\nfor Dubai at the instance of A-1 and for which A-46 used to bring the  cash.\nFurther, from a perusal of the confessional statement of A-46, it  is  clear\nthat on 8/9th February, A-1 gave him Rs. 50,000/- for giving it to A-67  and\nhe accordingly delivered  the  same  to  him.   It  has  also  come  in  the\nconfession of A-46 that on 14/15 February, he, alongwith A-10 brought Rs.  4\nlakhs from A-97 and gave the same to A-1.

It is also clear from the confession  of  A-67  that\nit was A-46 who used to bring the cash for the tickets he was booking for A-\n1 for Dubai.  Asif Sultan Devji (PW-341) and Massey Fernandes (PW-311)  have\ndeposed about the booking of 12 tickets and 1  ticket  respectively  at  the\ninstance of A-67.

Even  on  10.03.1993,  Rs.  21  lakhs\nwere transferred to the  account  of  Irani  from  Tiger’s  account  at  the\ninstance of A-1 by A-10.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_218\">113)  The timing of these transfers, if seen in the  context  of  activities\nbeing  carried  out  contemporaneously,  was  transferred  for  meeting  the\nexpenses for achieving the objects  of  conspiracy,  to  meet  the  expenses\nincurred for ticketing of the co-conspirators and also to meet the  expenses\nto be incurred during that period.  As  far  as  Tejarath  International  is\nconcerned, it has come in the evidence of S.P.

The  admission  of\nA-67 in 313 statement is also evident from the booking of tickets  to  Dubai\nthrough PW-341, who was running a travel agency  by  the  name  of  M/s  ABC\nTravels and  Massey  Fernandes  (PW-311)  was  working  with  M/s  Hans  Air\nServices Pvt.

The\nprosecution has examined PW-310 and shows that it was A-1  who  was  booking\ntickets and would send his employee to  collect  the  same  from  East  West\nTravels.  He is a convincing witness for the fact  that  A-1’s  firm  office\nwas burnt in the riots and that he had started working  from  his  residence\nat Al Hussaini Building.  It is relevant to mention that  practically  there\nwas no cross examination of the witness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_225\">117)  It has come in evidence (confessional statements  of  A-67  and  A-46)\nthat 4 suitcases were kept in the jeep which was parked in  the  residential\npremises of Amhjad Ali Meharbax (A-68-since discharged) by  A-11  and  Anwar\nTheba (AA) at the  instance  of  A-1.   Subsequently,  A-67  took  away  the\nsuitcases and kept them in his office at the instance of  A-1.  Later,  A-46\nbrought three more suitcases and kept them at the office of  A-67.   Out  of\nthe total seven suitcases,  A-67  delievered  5  suitcases  to  A-1  at  Al-\nHussaini Building.  Thus, two suitcases remained in his possession.  It  has\nfurther been disclosed by A-67 that due to the involvement  of  A-1  in  the\nmatter, he kept the said  suitcases  at  the  residence  of  Mohammed  Hanif\n(PW-282).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_226\">118)    After the arrest of A-67, he made a disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_271\">Section  27</a>  of\nthe Evidence Act and led the Police and Pancha (PW-37) to the  residence  of\nMohammed Hanif from where the following articles were  recovered  and  taken\ninto possession vide Panchnama Exh. 109:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_283\">a)    One suitcase (<a href=\"/doc/111604/\" id=\"a_272\">Article 42</a>) was found  containing  65  handgrenades  and\n100 electronic detonators.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_227\">b)    One VIP suitcase (<a href=\"/doc/1256023/\" id=\"a_273\">Article 43</a>) was found containing  40  hand  grenades\nand 50 electronic detonators.

On  the\nsecond occasion, A-46 had delivered 3 more suitcases to A-67  and  on  being\nasked, A-46 stated that the  suitcases  were  containing  round  bombs  etc.\nThus,  A-67,  in  all  had  received  7  bags  from  A-1   which   contained\narms/ammunitions etc.   A-67,  thereafter,  returned  5  bags  to  A-1  that\nincluded 4 bags which were received on the first occasion  and  one  of  the\nthree bags received on the second occasion.  Thus  in  all,  there  remained\ntwo bags with A-67 which were recovered by PW-506.  These facts were  stated\nby A-67 in his confessional statement which has  since  been  exhibited  and\nread in  evidence  as  substantive  evidence.   Moreover,  the  confessional\nstatement of A-67 corroborated the evidence of PW-37, PW-506 and PW-282.  A-\n46, in his confessional statement, also  stated  about  the  delivery  of  3\nsuitcases to A-67 by A-1, but there is a small discrepancy about the  manner\nof receipt of 3 suitcases by A-67 wherein he stated that A-46 had  delivered\n3 suitcases to A-67.  The manner of delivery of 3 suitcases is not  of  much\nimportance, as it has clearly come in the confession of A-67 in  respect  of\ndelivery of bags at the instance of A-1 and the subsequent recovery  of  two\nsuitcases at the instance of A-67 which contained 105 hand grenades and  150\nelectronic detonators.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_231\">120)     In the confessional statement of A-46, it  was  mentioned  that  on\n13.02.1993 he alongwith Anwar Theba (AA) went to the residence of Amjad  Ali\nMeharbax (since discharged).  Accordingly, both of  them  brought  the  said\njeep to the Al-Hussaini Building and Anwar Theba went  up  and  handed  over\nthe key of the jeep to A-1.  On 14/15.02.1993, when A-46 was present at  Al-\nHussaini Building alongwith Anwar Theba (AA), A-1 called Anwar upstairs  and\nafter sometime Anwar came down alongwith three suitcases.  He  also  brought\nthe key of a jeep kept inside the garage  and  Anwar  Theba  asked  A-46  to\nunscrew the bolts of the floor of the  jeep.    A-46  accordingly  unscrewed\nthe bolts of the floor and when he was about  to  lift  the  floor,  he  was\nasked by A-1 to go to the office  of  A-67.   He  immediately  went  to  the\noffice of A-67 and when he found that A-67 was not there,  he  informed  A-1\naccordingly.  At that time, A-46 saw that Anwar Theba was filling  something\nin the said suitcases which was of light green colour and  round  in  shape.\nAt that time, A-1 asked A-46 to stand  outside  the  garage  and  watch  the\nmovements of the people.  He was apparently sent outside by A-1 so  that  he\ncould not see the contents which were being filled  in  the  suitcases.   He\nwas again sent by A-1 to see whether A-67 was  available.   Accordingly,  he\nwent to the office of A-67 and as A-67 was not present, he came back to  Al-\nHussaini.  At that time, he saw A-67  keeping  the  said  suitcases  in  his\nMaruti Van.  In the light of the evidence on record, it is  clear  that  A-1\nwas in possession of  handgrenades  and  electronic  detonators  which  were\nconcealed in the jeep and which were delivered to A-67  in  three  suitcases\nby A-1 through A-46.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_232\">121)   PW-87, who was the driver working for Abdul Razak Suleman  Memon  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_233\">5), has deposed that A-5 was having four vechicles, namely, red Maruti  Van,\nblue Maruti Car, white coloured Maruti  Car  and  one  red  coloured  Maruti\n1000.  He also stated that A-5 was staying at  5/6th  floor  of  Al-Hussaini\nBuilding alongwith his wife,  daughter-in-laws  and  sons,  namely,  Essa  @\nAnjum Abdul Razak Memon (Anjumbhai)  (A-3),  Yusufbhai  (A-4)  and  Ayubbhai\n(AA).  He also stated about  taking  his  blue  coloured  Maruti  car  to  a\nservice station opposite to Paradise Talkies  on  2-3  occasions.   He  also\nidentified his signatures (Exh. Nos. 444 and 445) on the  bills  (Exh.  Nos.\n444A and 445A) respectively.  These signatures were affected by him  at  the\ntime of taking the car for  servicing.

He also stated that he had written the name of the  owner  of\nthe car and  the  car  number  on  the  said  bills  on  the  basis  of  the\ninformation given by the Driver who brought the car  for  servicing  on  the\nsaid two occasions.  It is pertinent  to  note  here  that  the  driver  who\nbrought the vehicle for servicing was PW-87 as evident from  his  signatures\non Exh. Nos. 444 and 445.  Exh. Nos.  444A  and  445A  shows  that  A-1  was\nmentioned as the owner of Vehicle No. MP-09-H-0672.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_235\">123)  It has been proved that  the  said  Maruti  Car  of  blue  colour  was\nplanted at Bombay Stock Exchange which exploded  at  03:30  hrs  killing  84\npersons, injuring 217 persons and causing loss to property  worth  rupees  5\ncrores.

Engine  No.  F/8/BIN703676  and\nChassis No. 481528 was seized by PW-86 and PW-370 respectively.  It is  also\nevident that the Maruti 800 Car bearing No. MP-09-H-0672  was  purchased  by\nShafi Zariwala (AA) in  the  beginning  of  1992  through  Suleman  Mohammed\nLakdawala (PW-365), Shakeel S.

Whether  such  confession  requires  corroboration\n      depends on the facts of the given case. If the court is convinced that\n      the probative value of the confession is such that it does not require\n      corroboration then the same can  be  used  for  convicting  the  maker\n      and/or the co-accused  under  the  Act  and/or  the  other  enactments\n      without independent corroboration.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_334\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1405525\" id=\"span_115\">146)   In <a href=\"/doc/1405525/\" id=\"a_311\">Mohd.

It would, therefore, be clear, as rightly contended by Shri Rawal\n      that merely because the guidelines in <a href=\"/doc/1813801/\" id=\"a_312\">Kartar Singh v. State of  Punjab</a>\n      were not fully  followed,  that  by  itself  does  not  wipe  out  the\n      confession recorded. We have already given  our  reasons  for  holding\n      that the confession was recorded by A.K. Suri (PW 2) taking full  care\n      and cautions which were required to be observed  while  recording  the\n      confession.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_336\">      60. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"568914\" id=\"span_117\">In <a href=\"/doc/568914/\" id=\"a_313\">Ravinder Singh v. State of Maharashtra</a> it has been observed  in\n      para 19 that if the confession made by the accused  is  voluntary  and\n      truthful  and  relates  to  the  accused  himself,  then  no   further\n      corroboration is necessary and a conviction  of  the  accused  can  be\n      solely based on it. It has also been observed that  such  confessional\n      statement is admissible as a substantive piece  of  evidence.  It  was\n      further observed that the said confession need not be tested  for  the\n      contradictions to be found in the confession of the co-accused. It  is\n      for that reason that even if the other oral evidence goes  counter  to\n      the statements made in the confession, one&#x27;s confession can  be  found\n      to be voluntary and reliable and  it  can  become  the  basis  of  the\n      conviction.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_337\">      61. In this case, there is ample corroboration to  the  confession  in\n      the oral evidence as well as the documentary evidence in  shape  of  a\n      chit, which is referred to in the said confession. There  is  a  clear\n      reference that the Personal Assistant, who was a non-Kashmiri and kept\n      a beard, had sent a slip inside. Ultimately, that slip  was  found  by\n      the police, which corroborates the contents in the confession. In  our\n      opinion, that is a sufficient corroboration to the confession.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_338\">      64. All these cases suggest that the only test which the court has  to\n      apply is whether the confession was voluntary and  free  of  coercion,\n      threat or inducement and whether sufficient caution is  taken  by  the\n      police officer who recorded the confession. Once the confession passes\n      that test,  it  can  become  the  basis  of  the  conviction.  We  are\n      completely convinced that the confession in this case  was  free  from\n      all the aforementioned defects and was voluntary.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_339\">147)   In view of the above, it can easily be inferred that with  regard  to\nthe use of such confession as against a co-accused, as a matter of  caution,\na general corroboration should be sought for but in cases  where  the  court\nis satisfied that the probative value of such confession  is  such  that  it\ndoes not require corroboration then it may base conviction on the  basis  of\nsuch confession of the co-accused without  corroboration.  But  this  is  an\nexception  to  the  general  rule  of  requiring  corroboration  when   such\nconfession is to be used against a co-accused.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_263\">Deposition of Md.

PW-2,  who  turned\napprover, is a native of District Rampur, U.P.  However, according  to  him,\nhe is residing at Bombay for the last  28  years.   He  was  working  as  an\nEstate Agent and Property Dealer.  He was  arrested  on  10.05.1993  by  the\nBombay Police in connection with the Bomb Blasts Case.  He was  arrested  on\nthe allegations that he was involved in the conspiracy,  landing,  planning,\ntraining and planting of bombs.  In his evidence, he admitted that  he  took\ntraining in handling of weapons in Pakistan for a period of  10  days  along\nwith others.   During  the  training,  according  to  him,  they  were  also\nimparted  training  for  handling  RDX.   For  the  present,  since  we  are\nconcerned about the role of A-1 relating to conspiracy, we  are  constrained\nto refer his evidence relating to the said  aspect.   He  admitted  that  he\nknew Javed Dawood Tailor (AA) known  as  Javed  Chikna,  Mushtaq  @  Ibrahim\nAbudal Razak Memon known as Tiger Memon  and  Yakub  Adbul  Razak  Memon  as\nYakub (A1).  While identifying the accused  concerned  in  the  Court,  PW-2\nidentified him in the fourth batch consisting of eight persons.  He  further\nstated that all the accused persons whom  he  identified  before  the  Court\nhave worked with him and admitted  that  they  were  together  in  the  bomb\nblasts.  It was further stated that  all  the  persons  including  A-1  were\ninvolved in planning, conspiracy, training, landing and planting  of  bombs.\nAccording to him, when he met Tiger Memon and others at Hotel Big Splash  on\n02.02.1993, he (Tiger Memon) told them that in communal riots in Bombay  and\nSurat, Muslims have suffered a lot and Babri Masjid has been demolished  and\nthat restrictions have been put even on “Azaan” and  “Namaz”.   He  informed\nall of them that during the  riots  their  mothers  and  sisters  have  been\ndishonoured and the Government is not extending any help to  them.   So,  he\nwanted to take revenge and he requested all of them  to  help  him  in  this\nregard. When this meeting was going on, two persons, namely, Yeda Yakub  and\nShahid also joined them in the meeting.  Tiger Memon also told them that  he\nhas arranged for arms and explosives from Pakistan which are coming on  that\nday and he also warned them that if any person betrays him, he  will  finish\nhim and his family.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_265\">149)  He further deposed that on the same day, at about 4 p.m., all of  them\nleft for Shekhadi Coast  in  two  Commander  Jeeps.   In  one  Jeep  he  was\ntraveling along with Tiger Memon, Javed, Munna, Anwar, Akbar and  Karimullah\nand others were in the second jeep driven by Shafi.  According  to  him,  at\nShekhadi Coast, three  agents  of  Tiger  Memon,  namely,  Dadabhai,  Dawood\nTaklya and Rahim Laundriwala along with 30/40 persons from the  neighbouring\nvillage were present.  At about 11 p.m., one speed boat came near the  coast\nand passed over 7  military  coloured  bags  containing  guns,  pistols  and\ngrenades of green colour having oval shape.  The  guns  were  AK-56  rifles.\nTiger  Memon  distributed  AK-56  rifles  to  Javed  and  Anwar  and  others\nincluding PW-2 were given handgrenades and pistols.  PW-2 was also  given  a\npistol.  All the goods were loaded  in  a  truck  which  was  parked  there.\nTiger asked them to  proceed  towards  Waghani  Tower.   When  they  reached\nWaghani Tower, PW-2 noticed that 2/3 jeeps and  a  Maruti  Car  were  parked\nthere.  He along with others unloaded the goods from the truck  and  brought\nthem to the central room of Waghani Tower.  On Tiger’s instructions, he  and\nothers unpacked the bags.  The  bags  were  containing  AK-56  rifles,  hand\ngrenades, pistols, round (cartridges),  wires  (detonators),  magazines  and\nRDX etc.  All these items were then  kept  in  the  cavities  of  the  motor\njeeps.  One box of detonators was kept in a blue coloured Commander Jeep  by\nShafi to take to Hotel Persian Darbar on the instructions of Tiger Memon.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_266\">150)  He also explained about booking of a room in Hotel Persian  Darbar  at\nPanvel on 10.02.1993 in the name of Md. Usman Khan.   On  11.02.1993,  Javed\nChikna came to his residence and asked for his  passport  telling  him  that\n‘Tigerbhai’ has called for it.  PW-2  handed  over  his  passport  to  Javed\nChikna.  PW-2 informed the Court  that  he  had  obtained  the  passport  in\nJanuary, 1987 and his passport  No.  is  B-751254.   At  about  1  p.m.,  he\nreceived a call from Javed Chikna informing him to come prepared  for  going\nto Dubai and to meet him at the Hindustan Soda Factory, Mahim.  At  about  4\np.m., he met Javed Chikna at the said place and from there  Javed  took  him\nto the Al Hussaini Building.  In categorical terms, he asserted  that  Tiger\nMemon resides in the Al-Hussaini Building at Mahim.  On 11.02.1993, when  he\nwent there, Tiger Memon and Yakub Memon (A-1) were sitting together  in  the\nflat.  Tiger Memon told Yakub Memon to give six air tickets to Javed  Chikna\n(AA).  Thereafter, Yakub Memon (A1) gave six air tickets  to  Javed  Chikna.\nPW-2 and Javed Chikna wished “Khuda Hafiz”  to  Tiger  Memon  and  left  the\nplace. Thereafter, he along with others went to the airport to go to  Dubai.\n He reached Dubai at 10.30 p.m.  At Dubai Airport, Ayub Memon (AA) had  come\nto receive them.  Ayub Memon is the brother of Tiger  Memon.   This  was  on\n11.02.1993.  He also informed the Court that on 13.02.1993, Tiger Memon  and\nAyub Memon met them at the  Dubai  Airport.   Tiger  Memon  gave  seven  air\ntickets of Pakistan International Airlines  and  their  passports  to  Javed\nChikna.  Tiger Memon informed all of them that they  need  not  worry  about\ntheir journey to Pakistan.  He also  informed  that  one  Jafar  Saheb  will\nreceive them at the Islamabad Airport  and  will  take  care  of  them.   On\nreaching Islamabad Airport, Jafar Saheb escorted  them  and  they  were  not\nrequired to pass through the immigration  counter  and  various  checks  and\nthey came out of the airport with their luggage without  any  problem.   The\nAirport Officials salute Jafar Saheb when he was escorting them out  of  the\nAirport.  He further explained  that  two  Jeeps  were  parked  outside  the\nAirport and from there they were  taken  to  a  bunglow.   On  reaching  the\nbungalow, Jafar Saheb collected their passports and  air  tickets  and  each\none of them was given a fake name.  He was named ‘Nasir’.   Likewise,  names\nof others were also changed.  Jafar Saheb instructed them that during  their\nstay in Pakistan they should call each  other  by  these  new  names.   They\nstayed in the bungalow for two days i.e.  14th  and  15th.   Then  on  16th,\nJafar Saheb took all of them to a different place  and  introduced  them  to\ntwo persons and informed them that these persons  will  impart  training  in\narms and ammunitions and left the  place.   On  the  next  day,  three  more\npersons joined the training camp and all of  them  were  given  training  in\noperating fire arms like AK-56 rifles, pistols and they were also shown  how\nto dismantle and reassemble the fire arms.  Training in fire arms was  given\nfrom 19.02.1993 to 21.02.1993. During this time, in  the  night,  nine  more\npersons came to the training camp, viz., Yeda Yakub  (AA-11),  Nasir  Dhakla\n(A-64), Anwar Theba (AA-8), Irfan Chougule (AA-12), Shahnawaz (A-29),  Abdul\nAkhtar (A-36), Mohmed Rafiq (A-94), Gullu (A-77) and  Bashir  Khan  (AA-15).\nThese persons also joined them for training.  According  to  PW-2,  in  all,\nthere were 19 persons taking training at the relevant  time.   On  the  next\nday, Tiger Memon along with one Ahmed Sahab arrived  at  the  training  camp\nand stayed there.  In training,  they  were  taught  how  to  operate  AK-56\nrifles, pistols, hand grenades and the  use  of  RDX  for  preparing  bombs.\nThey were given a practical demonstration of an RDX bomb  which  was  fitted\nwith a half an hour timer pencil detonator.  The bomb explosion resulted  in\na deafening sound followed by huge black smoke  and  it  blew  up  stonesand\nearth.  The next  day,  Tiger  left  the  camp.   On  27.02.1993,  they  all\nreturned from the training camp to the bungalow  where  they  were  kept  on\ntheir arrival at Islamabad.  All of them were escorted by  Ahmed  Sahab  and\nJafarbhai and without any checking they were given boarding cards  and  they\nleft Islamabad by a PIA flight and reached Dubai at about  1.30  to  2  p.m.\nOn reaching Dubai, Tiger took all of them to  a  bungalow  situated  at  Al-\nRashidia.  After finishing their meals, they discussed  the  communal  riots\nin Bombay and Surat where Muslims had suffered.  Thereafter, Tiger  directed\nIrfan Chougule (AA-12) to bring the holy Quran from the other  room.   Tiger\nadministered oath to all of them by placing their hands on  the  holy  Quran\nthat they will not  disclose  anything  about  the  training  in  Dubai  and\nPakistan to any person  including  their  family  members  and  about  their\nproposed future plans and in the  event  that  they  were  arrested  by  the\nPolice they would not disclose their plans and names  of  their  associates.\nThereafter, Tiger Memon distributed 200 Dirhams to  each  one  of  them  for\nshopping etc.  Thereafter, they left Dubai  in  batches  as  and  when  they\nreceived their passports and tickets.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_267\">151)    On  04.03.1993,   they   reached   Sahar   Airport,   Bombay.    The\nDisembarkation Card was filled by him in his own handwriting and he  himself\nsigned it.  At the airport, he noted that one Ambassador Car and one  Maruti\nCar had come to receive them.  He further stated that Tiger Memon and  Javed\nChikna sat in the Maruti Car which was  driven  away  by  Tiger  Memon.   He\nalong with Bashir Khan sat in the Ambassador Car in which Yakub Memon  (A-1)\nand one more person was sitting.  After reaching Mahim from there,  he  went\nto his house at 5 p.m.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_268\">152)  The critical analysis of the evidence of  PW-2  makes  it  clear  that\nthough he did not  mention  about  the  participation  of  A-1  in  all  the\nmeetings, however, he identified A-1 in court and asserted that  he  is  the\nbrother of Tiger Memon and it was he who assisted his  brother  at  the  Al-\nHussaini Building for all preparations, viz.,  purchasing  tickets,  getting\nvisas, making arrangements for the persons who were  sent  to  Pakistan  via\nDubai for training in handling and throwing bombs, filling RDX  in  vehicles\netc., their stay at Dubai  and  comfortable  return  of  such  persons  from\nPakistan to Bombay, payments  to  various  persons  who  underwent  training\nwhich clearly prove the involvement of A-1 in the conspiracy as well  as  in\nsubsequent events and actions along with his brother and other accused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_269\">153)   On the very same day, i.e, on 04.03.1993, all of them met at the  Taj\nMahal Hotel.  In the hotel, they went to the Coffee  shop,  Shamiana.   This\nwas around 10.30 to 10.45 p.m.   Tiger  Memon,  after  discussion  with  one\nFarooqbhai took them towards the Share  Market  building  in  his  car  near\nFountain and showed them the new and the old building of the  Share  Market.\nOn  the  way,  Tiger  Memon  told  them  to  survey  the  Bombay   Municipal\nCorporation Building and to check its two  entrances.   After  noticing  the\nsame from there, they returned to  the  Taj  Mahal  Hotel.   After  dropping\nTiger Memon at his residence i.e. at the Al-Hussaini Building,  Mahim,  they\ntook his maruti car and went to the residence of Sardar Shawali Khan  (A-54)\nat Kurla.  Bashir Khan then administered oath to A-54 stating that  whatever\nthey will do, they will  do  for  Islam  and  would  take  revenge  for  the\ndemolition of the Babri Masjid and communal riots.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_270\">154)  In respect of a question relating to the purpose  of  the  survey,  he\nanswered that the purpose was to shoot down  the  Municipal  Councillors  of\nBJP and Shiv Sena parties with AK-56 rifles by indiscriminately firing  upon\nthem.  After conducting the survey,  they  went  to  meet  Tiger  Memon  and\nbriefed him and after that left for their  house.   He  explained  that  the\nthird meeting was held on 07.03.1993 and in that meeting Javed  Chikna  (AA-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_271\">7), Tiger Memon (AA-2), Nasim @ Yusuf (A-49), Kalu, Bashir  Electrician  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_272\">13), Moin (A-43), Parvez Kelewala (A-100), Nasir Dhakla (A-64) and he  along\nwith Bashir Khan, Salim Rahim Shaikh, Akram @ Firoz  and  some  persons  who\nwere with them in the training and Sardar Shahwali  Khan  (A-54)  and  Lalli\nwere also present.  In the said meeting,  Tiger  organized  separate  groups\nfor surveying targets.  The task assigned to his group  was  to  survey  the\nSena Bhavan and Sahar Airport.  According to  him,  as  directed  by  Tiger,\nafter   completion   of   the   work,   he   and   others   briefed   Tiger.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_273\">155)  On 08.03.1993, a fourth meeting was held  at  Babloo’s  (AA-18)  place\nbetween 10 and 10.30 p.m.  This meeting was held at a flat  on  the  terrace\nportion.  After calling them, including PW-2 inside the  flat,  Tiger  Memon\nselected the targets.  These targets include  Air  India  Building,  Nariman\nPoint, Bharat Petroleum  Refinery,  Chembur,  Share  Market  near  Fountain,\nZaveri Bazaar near Mohd. Ali Road and  Pydhoni,  Five  Star  Hotels,  Cinema\nTheatres,  Shiv  Sena  Bhavan,  Shivaji  Park,   Dadar,   Bombay   Municipal\nCorporation  Building,  V.T.,  Sahar  Airport,   Passport   Office,   Worli,\nMantralaya etc.  These  were  the  places  which  were  to  be  attacked  by\nplanting bombs, by using AK-56 rifles and by throwing hand grenades.   Tiger\nMemon formed separate groups and gave instructions  separately.   About  the\nBombay Municipal Corporation Building, Tiger Memon also  explained  to  them\nthe entry and exit points of the said Building for the purpose of  attacking\nBJP and Shiv Sena Councillors with AK-56  rifles.   After  this,  they  came\nback to Mahim and left for their residence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_274\">156)  According to PW-2, another meeting  was  held  on  10.03.1993  at  the\nHindustan Soda Factory, Mahim in the evening.  There he  met  Javed  Chikna.\nAt that time, Javed Chikna informed him that in the evening  around  8  p.m.\nthere is a meeting at Shakil’s place at Bandra and directed  him  to  attend\nthe said meeting.  Pursuant to the same, PW-2 reached Shakil’s residence  at\n8.30 p.m.  There he met Tiger Memon, Javed Chikna, Salim  Bazarwala,  Bashir\nKhan, Zakir, Nasir Dhakla, Parvez  Kelewala,  Moin,  Iqbal,  Sardar  Shawali\nKhan, Bashir Electrician, Mehmood @ Kaloo and Nasim @  Yusuf.   Tiger  Memon\nalso distributed Rs.5,000/- to each one of them in  the  said  meeting.   He\nexplained to Tiger about the survey of the Chembur Refinery.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_275\">157)  On the next  day  i.e.,  on  11.03.1993,  they  all  gathered  at  the\nHindustan Soda Factory, Mahim at 8 p.m.   At  9.30  p.m.,  they  received  a\nphone call from Tiger Memon who directed  all  of  them  to  reach  the  Al-\nHussaini building immediately.  Pursuant to the said direction, all of  them\nincluding PW-2 went to the  fifth  floor  of  the  said  building,  i.e,  to\nTiger’s flat and he noticed several persons interacting with  Tiger.   Tiger\ncalled him to his bedroom.  There, once again, he explained  the  survey  of\nthe Chembur Refinery and informed him that there  is  very  tight  security,\nhence, it will be impossible to carry out the work there.   On  this,  Tiger\nMemon cancelled the plan of Chembur Refinery.  Tiger Memon  instructed  them\nthat as they have learnt the work relating to detonators and timer  pencils,\nthey should fill RDX in the vehicles and place detonators and timer  pencils\nin a proper way.  They all agreed to do the same.  Tiger Memon  handed  over\nsome detonators and timer pencils to them.  Tiger instructed them to  go  to\nthe Share Bazaar i.e. Stock Exchange and Air  India  Building.   Tiger  also\ngave pencils to various persons and instructed Javed Chikna and Anwar  Theba\nto pay Rs. 5,000/- to each one of them and also directed that they  have  to\nact and work according to the directions of Javed Chikna and Anwar Theba.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_276\">158)  He further informed the Court that Tiger Memon conveyed to  them  that\nafter the blasts in Bombay, there will be communal riots,  so  all  of  them\nshould leave Bombay and they can contact him over the  telephone.   He  gave\nhis telephone No. of Dubai as 27 27 28.  Thereafter, Tiger Memon met all  of\nthem and left in a Maruti Car with Anwar (AA-8), Asgar (A-10) and Shafi (AA-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_277\">9).  He also stated that in the garage Abdul Akhtar  (A-36),  Iqbal  (A-23),\nMoin (A-43), Kalu @ Mehmood, Nasim @ Yusuf (A-49) were filling  RDX  in  the\ndicky of the motor vehicles.  PWs 2 and  6  met  Farooq  Pawale  (A-16)  and\nJaved Chikna instructed Farooq Pawale to take one maruti car  to  Shiv  Sena\nBhavan, Dadar and park it near there.  As directed,  PW-2  accompanied  A-16\nin a white maruti car and it was he who drove the maruti car  to  Shiv  Sena\nBhavan.  He further informed  that  one  Hawaldar  (Constable)  was  sitting\nthere who was not allowing us to park the car but with great  difficulty  he\nparked the maruti car near the wall by  the  side  of  the  service  station\nwithin the campus of petrol pump.  The said petrol  pump  was  Lucky  Petrol\nPump and it has a common boundry wall with Shiv Sena Bhavan.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_278\">159)  He also explained that after reaching  the  Al-Hussaini  Building,  he\nwent to the fifth floor in Tiger’s flat.  There  he  saw  Javed  Chikna  was\ndistributing hand grenades to some persons, namely, Salim Bazarwala  (A-52),\nAbdul Akhtar (A-36), Kalu @ Mehmood, Moin (A-43) and Bashir Electrician  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_279\">13).  They all were given four hand  grenades  each  by  Javed  Chikna.   He\ninstructed them that they  would  have  to  throw  these  hand  grenades  in\nFishermen’s Colony at Mahim.  He also gave four hand grenades each to  Iqbal\n(A-23) and Nasim @ Yusuf (A-49) and directed  them  to  throw  the  same  to\nSahar Airport.  As planned, several blasts took place at various  places  in\nBombay.  He contacted Tiger Memon and  apprised  him  of  the  same  and  as\ndirected left Bombay immediately and reached Calcutta.  From there also,  he\ncontacted Tiger but he could not speak to him.  He reached  Delhi  by  train\nand went back to his village at Rampur, U.P.  He was arrested on  10.05.1993\nand on the same day, he was brought to Bombay.     About  his  statement  to\nDCP Bishnoi, he deposed before the Court on  25.06.1993  that  the  DCP  has\ncorrectly recorded his statement.   It  bears  his  signature  and  is  also\ncounter signed by DCP Bishnoi.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_280\">160)    On 20.09.1993, he wrote  a  letter  to  the  Joint  Commissioner  of\nPolice, Mr. M.N. Singh through the Jail Authorities.   In  this  letter,  he\nexpressed that he is repenting  the  crime  committed  by  him  against  his\ncountry and humanity and so he  wanted  to  confess  his  crime  before  the\nCourt.  At Killa Court, ACP Babar told him that if he  is  really  repenting\nwhat he has done then he can be made a witness and can be  given  pardon  if\nhe will tell the truth before the Court.  On his statement, he was  produced\nbefore the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate.   The  CMM  asked  him  about  his\ninvolvement in the Bombay blasts which took place on 12.03.1993.  He  stated\nbefore the CMM about his involvement  in  the  conspiracy  and  planting  of\nbombs and expressed that he is repenting for what he  had  done.   When  the\nCMM asked him whether he will state the same in the Court, PW-2 answered  in\nthe affirmative, i.e., Yes.  At this, the CMM  offered  him  pardon  and  he\naccepted it.  The entire conversation between the CMM and PW-2 was  recorded\nby the typist and read over to  him.  He  also  expressed  that  tender  and\nacceptance of pardon was correctly recorded and it bears his signature.   On\n28.09.1993, when he was granted pardon in the Killa Court,  he  was  brought\nback to the prison and kept in Ward No. 10.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_281\">161)  In the cross-examination, he admitted that he had been a  resident  of\nMahim since 1985.  With regard to several questions put by various  counsel,\nin his cross-examination, he admitted that he was involved in the case  from\nthe stage of conspiracy till planting of bombs and is  responsible  for  the\nexplosions.  He also admitted that he participated  in  all  the  stages  of\nconspiracy till the achievement of the object.  He admitted that the  blasts\nthat took place on 12.03.1993 were very heinous and a serious crime.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_282\">162)  When he was produced before the DCP, namely, Shri  K.L.  Bishnoi  (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_283\">193) on 25.06.1993, in categorical terms, he  explained  that  the  DCP  had\ncautioned him that he was going to record his confession  under  <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_314\">Section  15</a>\nof TADA and also warned him that he  was  not  bound  to  make  a  statement\nbefore him and that the said statement would be  used  against  him  in  the\ncourt during the trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_284\">163)     In respect of a question relating  to  certain  variations  in  his\nearlier statement (Exh. 25A), he informed the court that “I cannot  say  why\nit is not recorded in my statement Exh. 25A”.  Though counsel appearing  for\nthe accused pointed out certain variations/omissions,  if  we  consider  the\nentire statement both in the examination-in-chief  and  his  explanation  in\nthe cross examination, we are of  the  view  that  those  omissions  do  not\nmaterially affect his statement.  In fact, he has admitted that he  narrated\nthe whole story to Mr. Bishnoi and he recorded whatever  was  told  to  him.\nHowever, he admitted that certain statements have been incorrectly  recorded\nin Exh. 25A.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_285\">164)      In cross-examination, he reiterated what  he  had  stated  in  the\nexamination-in-chief that he came into  contact  with  Tiger  in  connection\nwith property dealing through Javed Chikna.  Thereafter,  he  admitted  that\nhe used to meet Tiger at the Hindustan Soda Factory where Javed Chikna  also\nused to visit.  He informed the Court that Javed Chikna  was  a  ‘dada’  and\nhatchman of Tiger.  He was assured that there was no risk  in  participating\nin the landing of goods which were being smuggled  by  Tiger  as  Tiger  was\nknown for managing everyone.  According to him, the Hindustan  Soda  Factory\nat Mahim was a den for all sorts of anti-social activities which  was  owned\nby the brother-in-law of  accused  Hanif  Kandawala.   In  the  meeting,  he\nagreed to participate in the conspiracy because Tiger aroused his  religious\nfeelings mentioning  about  communal  riots  and  demolition  of  the  Babri\nMasjid.  He admitted that on 12.03.1993, he left  the  Al-Hussaini  building\nin a Maruti Van  bearing  No.  MFC  1972  in  order  to  attack  the  Bombay\nMunicipal Corporation building which was the target entrusted to him and  to\nhis team.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_286\">165)      When he was in custody,  he  came  to  know  that  most  of  other\naccused have also made confessions like him.  He also admitted that  he  was\naware  that  they  will  be  caught  for  the  destruction  caused  in  bomb\nexplosions and the maximum penalty will be  death.   Assistant  Commissioner\nof Police, Mr. Babar had told him in  Killa  Court  that  if  he  agreed  to\nbecome a prosecution witness and make a true and full disclosure of  events,\nhe will be granted pardon to which he agreed.  According  to  him,  he  read\nthe Order Exh. 27.  The  order  was  directed  to  be  produced  before  the\nMetropolitan Magistrate, 13th Court, Dadar for recording a  statement  under\nSection 164.  In para 215 of the cross-examination,  in  categorical  terms,\nhe admitted “my statement  Exh.  25A  is  correctly  recorded  except  small\nmistakes and so what I deposed before the Court in  my  examination-in-chief\nand recorded on Page 138  in  para  88  to  the  effect  that  my  statement\nrecorded on 28.06.1993 and 29.06.1993 is correctly recorded, is correct.”\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_287\">166)  In para 233 of his cross-examination,  PW-2  has  admitted  that  “the\ncontents of the retraction (Exh-D-2) are not his statements as  it  contains\nlanguage  and  words  of  a   qualified   person   conversant   with   legal\nterminology”.  For another question, he specifically denied  that  prior  to\nbecoming an approver, he was trying to  extract  money  from  other  accused\npersons.  He also denied the allegation as incorrect that on  05.10.1993  he\nexpressed his unwillingness to become an approver and showed his anxiety  to\njoin the company of other accused.   He  also  denied  the  allegation  that\nwhile he was in police custody, the police obtained his signature  on  blank\nsheets.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_288\">167) With regard to the Al-Hussaini Building,  he  stated  that  there  were\ncertain  open  and  closed  garages.   He  described  that  the  Al-Hussaini\nbuilding is a multistoried building and Mahim Police Station is situated  at\na walking distance of one minute from the said Building. In para-243 of  his\nstatement, in categorical terms, he admitted that “I  have  participated  in\nall the stages of conspiracy  till  Bombay  blasts  on  12.03.1993  i.e.  in\nlanding  of  arms  and  ammunitions  and  explosives,  weapons  training  at\nIslamabad, survey of targets chosen for causing bomb explosions  in  various\nmeetings held to plan things and also in planting  of  motor  vehicle  bombs\nnear Shiv Sena Bhavan  and  in  the  unsuccessful  attempt  to  attack  i.e.\npreparation by proceeding towards the goal  in  a  Maruti  Van  MFC-1972  to\nattack Councillors of BJP and Shiv Sena in B.M.C. Building at V.T.”\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_289\">168)  Regarding weapons training, he mentioned in  para  244  that   “It  is\ncorrect to say that for the first time  in  my  life,  I  was  given  weapon\ntraining  in  handling  and  operation  of  AK-56  rifles,  9  mm   pistols,\nhandgrenades and RDX explosives during the period 17.02.1993 to  27.02.1993.\n Before this, I have never operated any fire arm.  It is  true  that  I  was\ngiven a loaded Pistol at Shekhadi Coast on  the  night  of  02.02.1993  with\nclear instructions to attack any outsider who comes to the landing  site,  I\ndid not tell Tiger Memon  that  I  do  not  know  how  to  operate  Pistol.”\nRegarding training and execution of work, he stated that “my object  was  to\ntake  training  and  participate  in  the  acts  in  accordance   with   the\ninstructions of Tiger Memon”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_290\">169)  About his reaction after Bombay blasts, he stated  in  his  deposition\nthat “on 12.03.1993, after  the  successful  explosion  of  bombs,  my  only\ndesire was to run away and escape as otherwise if  I  was  arrested  by  the\npolice, my position would  have  been  precarious.”   Regarding  landing  of\nammunitions and explosives,  he  admitted  that  arms  and  ammunitions  and\nexplosives  were  landed  at  Shekhadi  in  the  intervening  night  between\n02.02.1993 and 03.02.1993 and this consignment was carried out  as  per  the\ninstructions of Tiger Memon.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_291\">170)  Regarding filling of RDX and other  ammunition,  he  stated  that  the\nwork of filling RDX in the motor vehicles started  after  half  an  hour  of\nTiger Memon’s departure.  According to him, there  were  about  10-12  motor\nvehicles like Ambassador cars, Maruti cars, Commander  jeeps  and  scooters.\nHe explained that a motor vehicle  bomb  can  be  prepared  by  loading  RDX\nexplosive in its dicky or at any place in the vehicle and by fixing it  with\na timer pencil and that it will  explode  at  the  time  set  in  the  Timer\nPencil.  The time of explosion will deviate and depend on  the  temperature.\nThe timer pencil which he was shown in the training had a  duration  ranging\nfrom half an hour to five hours.  He and others were trained in Pakistan  to\nprepare motor vehicle bombs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_292\">171)  In para 322, he asserted that in his statement before  P.I.  Pharande,\nDCP Bishnoi and P.I. Chavan, he had stated the truth and made full and  true\ndisclosure of all the facts within his knowledge.  In his  statement  before\nthese officers, he reiterated that  he  had  stated  all  the  relevant  and\nimportant events within his  knowledge.   He  also  admitted  that  “he  was\nmotivated to participate in this heinous crime by Tiger  Memon  by  arousing\nhis sentiments by administering oath on holy Quran  for  taking  revenge  of\nthe demolition of Babri Masjid, riots in Bombay and Surat  in  which  Muslim\npeople had suffered a lot, destruction caused in communal  riots  in  Bombay\nand Surat, restrictions imposed on ‘Azaan’ and ‘Namaz’ and  dishonouring  of\ntheir family members in riots and Government remaining silent and hence,  he\ngot prepared to participate in the crime to take revenge.”\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_293\">172)  With regard to the relationship of A-1 with his  brother  and  others,\nit was stated by him that “In my statement before P.I.Chavan I  have  stated\nthat Yakub Memon, with one more person had come to receive us at  the  Sahar\nAirport on our return from Dubai as stated by me before the Court  which  is\nrecorded on Page: 108 Para 60.  Similarly, I also stated that I  along  with\nBashir Khan sat in the Ambassador Car in which  Yakub  Memon  and  one  more\nperson were there, as stated  by  me  before  the  Court,  but,  it  is  not\nrecorded in my statement before P.I.Chavan, I can not assign any reason  why\nit  is  not  recorded  by  P.I.Chavan.”   He  also   reiterated   that   his\nconfessional statement was recorded as per his narration  and  DCP,  Bishnoi\n(PW-193) used to dictate it to the typist as per his say.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_294\">173)  He is also very well aware of the fact that giving false  evidence  in\nCourt is an offence and asserted that he is a law abiding citizen.  In  para\n364, he fairly accepted that after recording his  statement  and  after  its\ncompletion, he signed it on all the pages at the bottom and at  the  end  of\nthe statement before he came out of  the  office  of  the  DCP.   After  his\nsignature, DCP Bishnoi checked up  his  signature  on  all  the  pages  and,\nthereafter, he also signed the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_295\">174)  About his willingness to confess his guilt before the  Court,  let  us\nconsider whether all the  required  formalities  and  procedures  have  been\ncomplied  with  by  the  concerned  investigating  officer  and  the   court\nconcerned.  The Chief Investigating Officer, Bomb Blast Case, in his  letter\ndated 28.09.1993, addressed to  the  Chief  Metropolitan  Magistrate  stated\nthat after the Bombay blast that  took  place  on  12.03.1993,  one  of  the\naccused, namely, Mohammed Usman Ahmed Jan Khan (PW-2) who also  participated\nright from the conspiracy ending with blasts on 12.03.1993 and who had  been\narrested has submitted an application from  jail  on  20.09.1993  expressing\nvoluntary readiness and willingness to confess his guilt before  the  Court.\nIn the said letter, it was further stated that during the investigation,  it\nhas transpired that a conspiracy was hatched between the accused persons  in\nDubai and in pursuance of the said conspiracy, some of the  accused  persons\ninvolved in the blasts were sent to Pakistan for training  in  handling  RDX\nexplosives,  firearms,  grenades  etc.    It   further   transpired   during\ninvestigation that the said  conspiracy  was  hatched  in  order  to  strike\nterror in people as well as to affect adversely the harmony  between  Hindus\nand Muslims and  also  to  wage  war  against  the  Central  and  the  State\nGovernment.  In the said letter, it  was  further  stated  that  except  the\nparticipants, nobody had any personal knowledge of how, when, where and  why\nthe criminal conspiracy was hatched and how all  the  details  were  chalked\nout to perfect the said conspiracy, how  different  acts  were  carried  out\nwith determined intention of achieving the object  of  the  said  conspiracy\nincluding training in Pakistan, how RDX explosives and other  firearms  were\nsmuggled into India, how the RDX laden vehicles were  planted  at  different\nplaces in Bombay and how the  bomb  blasts  took  place.   The  officer  has\nfurther stated that the said accused (PW-2) has  voluntarily  expressed  his\ndesire to confess before the  Court  out  of  repentance.   Accordingly,  he\nsuggested that instead of his  mere  confession,  his  evidence  before  the\nCourt as a prosecution witness would help the prosecution to a great  extent\nin collecting evidence against such other offenders.   He  also  noted  that\ninasmuch as the accused is repenting very much and is prepared  to  run  the\nrisk of giving a judicial confession, the said accused would be a very  good\nwitness as an approver if pardon is granted to him by  this  Court.   Hence,\nit was urged that it is necessary to tender pardon to the  said  accused  on\nthe condition of  his  true  and  full  disclosure  of  all  the  facts  and\ncircumstances within his knowledge so far as conspiracy  hatched  in  Dubai,\ntraining in Pakistan, smuggling of RDX and landing of the same at Dighi  and\nShekhadi coasts, transportation of RDX to Bombay, filling  of  the  vehicles\nwith RDX and  planting  of  the  same  at  important  places  in  Bombay  on\n12.03.1993 and other acts incidental  thereto  are  concerned.   With  these\nparticulars and details, the Chief Investigating Officer prayed  before  the\nCourt or such other Metropolitan Magistrate that he may kindly  be  directed\nto record his statement under Section 164 of the Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_296\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"342903\" id=\"span_118\">175)  The said application of the <a href=\"/doc/342903/\" id=\"a_315\">Chief Investigating Officer,  Bombay  Bomb\nBlast</a> case on 28.09.1993 was submitted to the Court through  Special  Public\nProsecutor Shri Nikam. Shri Nikam has also produced the  warrant  issued  by\nthe Designated Court in Misc. Application No. 632 of 1993  in  TADA  Special\nR.A. No. 34 of 1993.  In the said warrant,  the  Designated  Court  directed\nthat the accused Mohammed Usman Jan Khan be produced and  forwarded  to  the\nCourt of Chief Metropoitan Magistrate on 28.09.1993 at  1200  hours  with  a\ndirection to the said Court to tender pardon to him on the condition of  his\ntrue and full disclosure of facts pertaining to the  Bombay  blast  offences\nwithin  his  personal  knowledge.   Thereafter,  after  fulfilling  all  the\nformalities,  the  said  accused  was  first   questioned   by   the   Chief\nMetropolitan Magistrate, Bombay at 4.15 p.m.  The accused stated that he  is\naware that he is before  the  Court  of  Chief  Metropolitan  Magistrate  of\nBombay.  Thereafter, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate  showed  the  accused\nhis handwritten application dated 20.09.1993 addressed by  him  from  Bombay\nCentral Prison to Shri M.N.Singh,  Joint  Commissioner  of  Police,  Bombay.\nThe accused identified  his  hand  writing  and  his  signature.   On  being\nconfronted with this letter, the accused stated that the letter was  written\nby him voluntarily.  The Chief Metropolitan  Magistrate,  thereafter,  asked\nthe accused as to whether he was aware as  to  why  he  was  being  produced\nbefore him.  By way of reply, the accused stated that  he  was  involved  in\nthe Bombay blasts which took place in Bombay on 12.03.1993 along with  other\npersons in a conspiracy and as he desires to disclose all  these  things  in\nfull detail, he is  being  produced  before  him.   The  Chief  Metropolitan\nMagistrate further noted that he was prepared to make  all  the  disclosures\nin detail.  The accused also replied that he is ready and willing  to  stand\nas a witness for prosecution and would make all these disclosures if  pardon\nis granted to him.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"342903\" id=\"span_119\">The Chief  Metropolitan  Magistrate  has  also  recorded\nthat on going through the replies given by the accused to  several  queries,\nhe was satisfied that the accused is ready and willing to give  a  full  and\ntrue disclosure of  all  circumstances  within  his  knowledge  relating  to\n<a href=\"/doc/342903/\" id=\"a_316\">Bombay Bomb  Blasts</a>  Case.   The  Chief  Metropolitan  Magistrate  has  also\ncarefully perused the report of the  Chief  Investigating  Officer  and  was\nfully satisfied that it is a case of conspiracy  and  in  pursuance  to  the\nsaid conspiracy, the accused  and  other  persons  had  planted  and  caused\nexplosion of bombs at various places in Bombay  on  12.03.1993.   Therefore,\nhe was satisfied that the grounds given by the Chief  Investigating  Officer\nin his application were true and correct.   After  recording  the  same,  on\n28.09.1993 itself, he passed an order in view of  powers  conferred  on  him\nunder Section 306 of the Code and tendered pardon  to  the  accused-Mohammed\nUsman Jan Khan  (PW-2)  on  the  condition  of  his  making  full  and  true\ndisclosure of all the circumstances within his  knowledge  relating  to  the\nblasts which occurred on 12.03.1993 and also in respect of  the  offence  of\nconspiracy and such other offences connected  therewith  in  the  commission\nthereof.  The said order has been read over and explained to the accused  in\nHindi and he accepted the tender  of  pardon  on  the  aforesaid  condition.\nPursuant to the same, the Superintendent, Central Jail, Bombay was  directed\nto keep the accused (PW-2) in a separate cell under proper surveillance  and\nto  make  him  available  for  the  purpose  of  producing  him  before  the\nMetropolitan Magistrate for recording his statement  under  Section  164  of\nthe Code as requested by Chief Investigating Officer.  The  above  mentioned\nletter  of  the  Chief  Investigating  Officer  dated  28.09.1993  and   the\nconsequential order  passed  by  the  Chief  Metropolitan  Magistrate  dated\n28.09.1993 giving pardon and recording his statement satisfy  the  procedure\nprescribed and there is no flaw with regard to the grant of pardon  and  the\nrecording of his statement thereafter.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_297\">176)  A perusal of the entire evidence of  PW-2  clearly  show  that  at  no\npoint of time he acted under pressure to become an  approver.   It  is  also\nclear that after serious thought and due to repentance, he realized that  in\nsuch a serious matter it is better to reveal all the details to  the  Court.\nHe withstood the  lengthy  cross-examination.  PW-2’s  testimony  runs  into\nhundreds of pages and he covered  all  the  aspects  starting  from  initial\nconspiracy and ending with execution of blasts at various places  in  Bombay\non 12.03.1993.  We  are  also  satisfied  that  his  confessional  statement\nbefore the Deputy Commissioner  of  Police  and  his  statement  before  the\nDesignated Court are not borne out of fear but due  to  his  conscience  and\nrepentence.  We are also satisfied that  his  statement  is  believable  and\nmerely because at one or  two  places,  he  made  certain  comments  on  the\nomission/addition in the  statement  recorded  by  the  Chief  Investigating\nOfficer, it does not materially affect the statement.   On  the  whole,  his\ntestimony is reliable  and  acceptable  and  the  Designated  Court  rightly\nrelied on his entire statement in support of the prosecution case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_298\">177)  It was further contended by learned senior counsel that  the  evidence\nof the approver does not incriminate the appellant  (A-1).   The  deposition\nof PW-2 reveals several incriminating circumstances  against  the  appellant\n(A-1) which may be summarized as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_340\">      (i)   PW-2 identifies the appellant in Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_341\">      (ii)  PW-2 has deposed that on being told by  Tiger  Memon  (AA),  the\n      appellant gave six air tickets to Javed  Chikna  (AA)  at  Al-Hussaini\n      Building on 11.02.1993 for going to Dubai.

At\n      the airport, two cars were waiting to receive them and PW-2 sat in  an\n      Ambassador car in which the appellant was also present.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_301\">178)  PW-2 stated that the tickets were given by  the  appellant  to  a  co-\nconspirator which fact has been corroborated by  A-10  in  his  confessional\nstatement.  If this evidence is considered along with the  fact  that  these\ntickets were arranged by the appellant (A-1)  and  he  was  present  in  the\nmeeting of the co-conspirators, i.e., in the meeting of Tiger  Memon,  PW-2,\nJaved Chikna and A-10, it  very  clearly  establishes  his  unity  with  the\nobject of the conspiracy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_302\">179)  The  prosecution  has  established  by  evidence  that  arranging  the\ntickets to Dubai was one of the responsibilities of A-1.  It is  very  clear\nthat the deposition  of  PW-2  to  the  extent  that  when  PW-2  and  other\nconspirators were called by  Tiger  Memon,  Yakub  Memon  was  also  present\nthere, who on being asked by Tiger Memon, handed over the tickets to  a  co-\nconspirator which clearly establishes the active  participation  of  A-1  in\nthe conspiracy.  If it was a conspiracy only known to Tiger Memon and  Yakub\nAbdul Razak Memon did not share the object of the conspiracy with the  Tiger\nMemon and other co-conspirators then Tiger memon would  not  have  met  with\nthe co-conspirators  in  the  presence  of  A-1.   The  fact  that  the  co-\nconspirators were called for the meeting in the presence  of  A-1  and  were\nbeing given  instructions  by  Tiger  Memon  about  the  conspiracy  in  his\npresence  clearly  establish  the  active  participation  of  A-1   in   the\nconspiracy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_303\">180)  It has further come in evidence that when  PW-2  returned  from  Dubai\nalong with Tiger Memon and other co-conspirators, A-1 was present  with  the\ncar at the airport and returned to Mahim along with  other  co-conspirators.\nIn fact, if A-1 had gone to the airport to  receive  his  brother  only,  he\nwould then have returned in the car with his  brother  alone.   However,  he\ncame back in  the  car  with  other  co-conspirators  which  also  show  his\nfamiliarity with other co-conspirators.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_304\">181)  It has also been contended by learned senior counsel for A-1 that  the\nevidence of an approver is  very  weak  and  reliance  has  been  placed  on\nvarious decisions of this Court  to  that  effect.   In  the  light  of  the\nprovisions of Section 133 read with Section 114 Illus (b)  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_317\">Evidence\nAct</a> this Court has held that  the  evidence  of  an  approver  needs  to  be\ncorroborated in material particulars.

The said statement has not been  pressed  into  service\nby the prosecution during the course of trial  against  any  accused  person\nincluding the appellant.  PW-2 has himself explained the episode leading  to\nthe drafting of the said retraction and stated that the said  statement  was\ndrafted at the instance of  one  Hanif  Kadawala  and  Samir  Hingora.   The\nwitness remained unshaken about the said aspect  in  the  deposition.   PW-2\nwas clear that he was told in jail by Hanif Kadawala and Samir Hingora  that\nunless PW-2 retracts his statement they would finish  him  and  his  family.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_305\">The following extracts from the deposition are pertinent in this regard:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_346\">Para 142 of the cross-examination of PW-2\n      “…..(The attention of the witness is drawn to one letter  tendered  by\n      Majeed Memon) “This letter has been written by me at the  instance  of\n      Hanif and Samir at the time I was made to write my retraction by them.\n       The letter is marked as Exh.

This  statement  has  been\nclarified by PW-2 in his cross-examination where he confirms  that  “It  did\nnot happen that Tiger Memon told Yakub Memon to  give  six  air  tickets  to\nAsgar and Yakub Memon gave six air tickets to Asgar.  The air  tickets  were\ngiven to Javed Chikna by Yakub  Memon  as  told  by  Tiger  Memon…”   It  is\nwrongly recorded in my statement Exhibit 25A.  I cannot  assign  any  reason\nwhy it is so recorded.”  Further,  PW-2  has  clarified  his  statement  and\nasserted that it was the appellant (A-1) who gave the air  tickets.   It  is\nfurther submitted that there is no contradiction about the fact that such  a\nmeeting amongst the co-conspirators took place  where  the  appellant  (A-1)\nwas present and he was asked to  provide  the  tickets.

It  was  submitted  by  learned  senior\ncounsel that the power to grant pardon is a  substantive  power  and  not  a\nprocedural power, and as such, the same has  to  be  conferred  specifically\nand cannot be assumed to be an inherent power of a Court.   In  the  instant\ncase, pardon has been granted by the Chief Metropolitan  Magistrate,  Bombay\nto PW-2 though there was no specific power of grant of pardon in  TADA  with\nthe Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, and as such, the  said  pardon  is  ultra\nvires the scheme of TADA and the evidence of  the  said  persons  cannot  be\nrelied upon against the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_312\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"729673\" id=\"span_120\">186)  In reply to the above contention, learned senior counsel for  the  CBI\nplaced reliance on a three-Judge Bench decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/729673/\" id=\"a_318\">Harshad  S.\nMehta &amp; Ors. vs. State of Maharashtra</a> (2001) 8 SCC 257 wherein an  identical\nobjection was raised, namely, in the  absence  of  specific  provisions  for\ngrant of pardon, the Special Court  has  no  power  to  grant  pardon  under\nSpecial Court (Trial of offences relating to  prosecutions  in  Securities),\nAct, 1992.  Taking note of various provisions  of  the  Code,  particularly,\nChapter XXIV, this Court repelled the said contention.  Chapter XXIV of  the\nCode deals with general provisons as to inquiries and trials.  Sections  306\nand 307 of the Code deal with tender of pardon to  an  accomplice.   Section\n306 confers power upon the Magistrate and Section 307 on the Court to  which\ncommitment is made.  Section  308  provides  for  the  consequences  of  not\ncomplying with the conditions of pardon by a person who has accepted  tender\nof pardon made under Section 306 or Section 307.

After  adverting  to  the\nabove mentioned provisions of the Code and in the absence  of  any  specific\nexclusion or bar for the application for grant of pardon by  Special  Courts\nin the Code, in <a href=\"/doc/729673/\" id=\"a_321\">Harshad S. Mehta</a> (supra), this Court has concluded  “but  it\ndoes not necessarily follow therefrom that the power to tender pardon  under\nSections 306 and 307 has not been conferred on the Special Court”.  In  para\n22, the Court has held as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_360\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1502681\" id=\"span_122\">“22. The Special Court may not be a criminal court  as  postulated  by\n      <a href=\"/doc/47052902/\" id=\"a_322\">Section 6</a> of the Code. All  the  same,  it  is  a  criminal  court  of\n      original jurisdiction.  On  this  count  the  doubt,  if  any,  stands\n      resolved by the decision of the Constitution Bench of  this  Court  in\n      <a href=\"/doc/1502681/\" id=\"a_323\">A.R.  Antulay  v.

Under the  Code,  it\n      will enjoy all powers which a court of original criminal  jurisdiction\n      enjoys save and except the ones specifically denied.”</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_361\">187)  Posing these questions, the Bench analysed to  see  whether  power  to\ngrant pardon has been specifically denied to the Special  Court  established\nunder the Act.  The contention of the learned senior counsel  was  that  the\nAct does not postulate commitment of the case to the Special  Court  and  no\nprovision having been inserted in the Act to empower the  Special  Court  to\ntender  pardon,  hence,  the  impugned  order  granting  pardon  is  without\njurisdiction.  In para 35, the Court has observed as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_362\">      “35. There  cannot  be  any  controversy  that  there  is  no  express\n      provision in the Act excluding therefrom the applicability of Sections\n      306 and 307 of the Code. Can  it  be  said  to  be  so,  by  necessary\n      implication, is what we have to determine.”\n\nThe following conclusions are also relevant:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_363\">      “51. The Code has been incorporated in the Act by application  of  the\n      doctrine of legislation by incorporation. The power  to  grant  pardon\n      has not been denied expressly or by necessary implication. As  earlier\n      stated after decision in the case of A.R. Antulay it was not necessary\n      to make specific provision in the Act conferring power on the  Special\n      Court to grant pardon at trial or pre-trial stage. The  Special  Court\n      is a court of original criminal jurisdiction and has all the powers of\n      such a court under the Code, including those of Sections 306 to 308 of\n      the Code, the same not having been excluded specifically or otherwise.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_364\">      52. There is no provision in the Act which negates the  power  of  the\n      Special Court to grant pardon. The Special Court has  power  to  grant\n      pardon at any stage of the proceedings. The power  under  Section  307\n      cannot be denied merely because no commitment of the case is  made  to\n      the Special Court. Learned Solicitor-General,  in  our  view,  rightly\n      contends that the other statutes are  only  an  external  aid  to  the\n      interpretation and to rely upon the omission of a provision  which  is\n      contained in another different enactment, it has to be shown that  the\n      two Acts are similar which is not the position here. The scheme of the\n      two Acts is substantially different as has been earlier noticed by us.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_327\">      It is also evident from Fernandes case as well”.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_328\">188)  After arriving at such a conclusion, the Bench, in  para  55  held  as\nunder:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_365\">      “55.  In  the  present  case,  we  are  unable  to  find  either   any\n      inconsistency or any provision which  may  indicate  expressly  or  by\n      necessary implication the exclusion  of  the  provision  of  the  Code\n      empowering grant of pardon.”\n\nAfter saying so, the Bench concluded as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_366\">      “62. Our conclusion, therefore, is that the Special Court  established\n      under the Act is a court of exclusive jurisdiction. <a href=\"/doc/47052902/\" id=\"a_325\">Sections 6</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/85348422/\" id=\"a_326\">7</a>\n      confer on the court wide powers. It is a court  of  original  criminal\n      jurisdiction and has all the powers of such a  court  under  the  Code\n      including those of Sections 306 to 308.”\n\n\nThe above conclusion fully supports the stand taken by CBI and the  ultimate\ndecision arrived at by the Designated Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_367\">189)   It was argued by learned senior counsel appearing for  the  CBI  that\nthe word ‘notwithstanding’ appearing in various  provisions  of  TADA  shows\nthat the Code would apply to all cases unless specifically provided  for  in\nthe TADA.  He placed reliance on <a href=\"/doc/199816836/\" id=\"a_327\">Section 4(2)</a> of the Code which provides  as\nfollows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_368\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1804135\" id=\"span_124\">“All offences under any other  law  shall  be  investigated,  inquired\n      into, tried and otherwise dealt with according to the same provisions,\n      but subject to any enactment for the time being  in  force  regulating\n      the manner or  place  of  investigating,  inquiring  into,  trying  or\n      otherwise dealing with such offences.”\n\nThe other decision relied upon by learned senior  counsel  for  the  CBI  to\nsupport his contention that the power of  pardon  does  exist  by  necessary\nimplication to cases under TADA is <a href=\"/doc/1804135/\" id=\"a_328\">Lt.

So, from the above,  it  is  clear\nthat no provision of TADA is inconsistent with the provisions  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_354\">Code\nof Criminal  Procedure</a>,  1973,  for  grant  of  pardon  as  envisaged  under\nSections 306 to 308.  While  upholding  the  power  of  the  special  courts\nestablished under a <a href=\"/doc/701797/\" id=\"a_355\">Special Courts Act</a> to grant pardon under Section 306  of\nthe Code, this Court, in <a href=\"/doc/729673/\" id=\"a_356\">Harshad S. Mehta</a> (supra) held thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_378\">      “61. … It is also not possible to  accept  that  it  was  intended  by\n      necessary implication that the Special Court under the Act  shall  not\n      have the power to grant pardon.  All powers of Sections 306 to 308  to\n      the extent applicable and can be complied are available to the Special\n      Court under the Act.  The provisions of the Act and the Code can stand\n      together.  There is no inconsistency.  The  two  statutory  provisions\n      can harmoniously operate without causing any confusion or resulting in\n      absurd consequences and the  scheme  of  the  Code  can,  without  any\n      difficulty, fit in the scheme of the Act….”\n\nFurther, TADA does not preclude the applicability  of  Section  306  of  the\nCode.  As observed earlier,  Section  306(2)(b)  is  clear  in  that  it  is\nspecifically applicable to instances where the offence for which an  accused\nis being tried is punishable with imprisonment extending to seven  years  or\nmore.  In the instant case, the  approver  was  accused  of  offences  which\ncarried the maximum punishment as capital punishment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_379\">191)  The object of Section 306 is to tender pardon in cases where  a  grave\noffence is alleged to have been committed by several  persons  so  that  the\noffence could be brought home  with  the  aid  of  evidence  of  the  person\npardoned.  The legislative  intent  of  this  provision  is,  therefore,  to\nsecure  the  evidence  of  an  accomplice  in  relation  to  the  whole   of\ncircumstances, within his knowledge, related to the offence and every  other\nperson concerned.  In the light of the above  analysis,  we  hold  that  the\npower to grant pardon under Section 306 of the  Code  also  applies  to  the\ncases tried under the provisions of TADA and there was no infirmity  in  the\norder granting pardon to the approver (PW-2) in the facts and  circumstances\nof the present case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_380\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"729673\" id=\"span_126\">192)  It is further contended on behalf of  the  appellant  (A-1)  that  the\ndeposition of PW-2 cannot be relied upon since the procedure  <a href=\"/doc/729673/\" id=\"a_357\">laid  down  in</a>\nSection 306(4)(a) of the Code was not followed.  In the instance  case,  the\nCMM granted pardon to PW-2 on 28.09.1993 in compliance with  the  provisions\nof Section 306.  Section 306(4)(a) requires that  the  Court  of  Magistrate\ntaking cognizance of the offence shall examine the witness.  In the  instant\ncase, where appellant has been charged with the  offences  under  TADA,  the\nDesignated Court established under TADA alone has the jurisdiction  to  take\ncognizance of the offences under TADA.  <a href=\"/doc/18097863/\" id=\"a_358\">Section 14</a> of TADA provides  that  a\nDesignated Court may take cognizance of any  offence,  without  the  accused\nbeing committed to it for trial, upon receiving a complaint of  facts  which\nconstitute such an offence or upon a police report of such  facts.   Section\n306(5) contemplates committal of a case by the Magistrate taking  cognizance\nof the offence to the court of appropriate  jurisdiction.   In  the  instant\ncase, there did not arise an occasion for the Magistrate to commit the  case\nto the Designated Court by virtue of above-said  provision  contained  under\n<a href=\"/doc/18097863/\" id=\"a_359\">Section 14</a> of TADA whereby the Designated Court  had  jurisdiction  to  take\ncognizane and try the offences in TADA.</span>  193)       This  Court,  in  Sardar\nIqbal Singh vs. State (Delhi Admn.) (1977) 4 SCC 536 while  dealing  with  a\ncase where the offence was triable  by  the  Special  Judge  who  also  took\ncognizance  of  the  offence  and  like  the  present  case,  no   committal\nproceedings were involved, held as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_381\">      “5. From these provisions it would appear  that  where  a  person  has\n      accepted a tender of pardon under sub-section (1) of  Section  337  at\n      the stage of investigation in a case involving  any  of  the  offences\n      specified  in  sub-section  (2-B),  the  prosecution  can   file   the\n      chargesheet either in the Court of a competent  Magistrate  or  before\n      the Special Judge who under <a href=\"/doc/616272/\" id=\"a_360\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Criminal Law Amendment\n      Act, 1952 has power to take cognizance  of  the  offence  without  the\n      accused being committed to him for  trial.  It  follows  that  if  the\n      Magistrate takes cognizance of the offence, the approver will have  to\n      be examined as a witness twice, once in the Court  of  the  Magistrate\n      and again. in the Court of the Special Judge to  whom  the  Magistrate\n      has to send the case for  trial,  but  if  the  chargesheet  is  filed\n      directly in the Court of the Special Judge, he can  be  examined  once\n      only before the Special Judge. This means that in  a  case  where  the\n      chargesheet is filed in the Court of a Magistrate, the accused gets an\n      opportunity of having the evidence of the approver at the trial tested\n      against what he had said before the Magistrate; the accused is  denied\n      this opportunity where the chargesheet is filed in the  Court  of  the\n      Special Judge. Whether the accused  will  get  the  advantage  of  the\n      procedure which according to the appellant is more beneficial  to  the\n      accused, thus  depends  on  the  Court  in  which  the  proceeding  is\n      initiated, and, it is contended, if the choice of forum is left to the\n      prosecution, it will result in discrimination. Mr Sen submits that the\n      only way to avoid this position is to read sub-sections (1),  (2)  and\n      (2-B) of Section 337 of the Code and <a href=\"/doc/616272/\" id=\"a_361\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Criminal  Law\n      Amendment Act, 1952 together and to construe them in a way to  require\n      that in  every  case  where  an  accomplice  is  granted  pardon,  the\n      chargesheet must be filed in the Court of a Magistrate.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_382\">      6. We are unable to accept the contention. It is clear from the scheme\n      of Section 337 that what is required is that a person  who  accepts  a\n      tender of pardon must be examined as a witness at the different stages\n      of the proceeding. Where, however, a Special Judge takes cognizance of\n      the case, the occasion for examining the approver as a witness  arises\n      only once. It is true that in such a case there would be  no  previous\n      evidence of the approver against which his evidence at the trial could\n      be tested, which would have been available  to  the  accused  had  the\n      proceeding been initiated in the Court of a Magistrate who under  sub-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_332\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1293557\" id=\"span_127\">section (2-B) of Section 337 of the Code is required to send the  case\n      for trial to the Special Judge after examining the approver. But we do\n      not find anything in sub-section (2-B) of Section 337 to suggest  that\n      it affects in any way the jurisdiction of the Special  Judge  to  take\n      cognizance of an offence without the accused being  committed  to  him\n      for trial. Sub-section (2-B) was inserted in Section 337  in  1955  by\n      Amendment Act 26 of 1955. If by enacting sub-section (2-B) in 1955 the\n      Legislature sought to curb the power given to  the  Special  Judge  by\n      <a href=\"/doc/616272/\" id=\"a_362\">Section 8(1)</a> of the Criminal Law Amendment  Act,  1952,  there  is  no\n      reason why the Legislature should not  have  expressed  its  intention\n      clearly. Also, the fact that the approver&#x27;s evidence cannot be  tested\n      against any previous statement  does  not  seem  to  us  to  make  any\n      material difference to the  detriment  of  the  accused  transgressing\n      <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_363\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. The Special Judge  in  any  case  will\n      have to apply the well established tests for the appreciation  of  the\n      accomplice&#x27;s evidence. This Court in <a href=\"/doc/1293557/\" id=\"a_364\">Maganlal Chhagganlal (P) Ltd.  v.\n      Municipal  Corporation  of  Greater  Bombay</a>   held   that   the   mere\n      availability of two procedures would not justify  the  quashing  of  a\n      provision as being violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_365\">Article 14</a> and that “what is necessary\n      to attract the inhibition  of  the  article  is  that  there  must  be\n      substantial and qualitative difference between the two  procedures  so\n      that one is really and substantially more drastic and prejudicial than\n      the other . . .”.  In  our  opinion,  there  is  no  such  qualitative\n      difference in the two procedures; whether a witness is  examined  once\n      or twice does not in our opinion make any such substantial  difference\n      here that one of them could be described  as  more  drastic  than  the\n      other.

He was promoted as Superintendent  of  Police  in\nApril 1985.  The rank of  Superintendent  was  equivalent  to  the  rank  of\nDeputy Commissioner of Police (DCP) in Greater  Bombay.   He  is  conversant\nand well versed with English,  Hindi,  Marathi  and  Punjabi  languages  and\naccording to him, he is  able  to  speak,  read  and  write  the  said  four\nlanguages.  Since January 1993, he was posted as DCP, Zone IX,  Bombay.   In\nFebruary 1993, Zone IX of Bombay was re-named as Zone X  and  he  functioned\nas DCP for Zone X up  till  August,  1994.   He  recorded  the  confessional\nstatement of 96 accused persons  in  this  case.   First,  he  recorded  the\nconfessional statement of A-11.  He explained before the Court the  relevant\nprovisions of TADA for recording a  confession,  procedure  to  be  followed\netc.  He also deposed before the Court that before recording  a  confession,\nhe used to receive a letter of requisition for the same.  He also  explained\nthat on each and every occasion, he explained his position  to  the  accused\nwho intended to make a confession and apprised him of the  fact  that  there\nwas no compulsion on  the  part  of  the  accused  to  make  a  confessional\nstatement and also informed the Court that he  had  also  explained  to  the\naccused  that  the  confession  would  be  used  against  him.   He  further\nexplained that upon the production of each accused,  he  verified  that  the\naccused was not under compulsion and was free from any  pressure  either  by\nthe investigating agency or by anyone else.   He  also  informed  the  Court\nthat after highlighting  all  the  procedures  and  satisfying  himself,  he\nallowed every accused to have 48 hours breathing time and asked the  accused\nconcerned that still if he was desirable to make such  a  statement  he  was\nfree to appear before him in his  office.   His  evidence  also  shows  that\nwhenever such accused was  produced,  he  used  to  verify  that  no  police\npersonnel or anybody else was present inside his Chamber  and  recorded  his\nconfessional  statement  after  closing  the  door  and  only  after  proper\nverification.  He also informed the Court that every accused who has made  a\nstatement before him was apprised of the fact  of  his  position  i.e.  DCP,\nZone X.  After making sure that the  accused  understood  his  position  and\nafter verifying the language, in which  he  desired  to  make  a  statement,\nrecorded the same in  his  own  handwriting.   He  also  explained  that  no\naccused had raised any complaint/grievance against  any  police  officer  or\npolice in general.  He also said that he  had  asked  all  the  accused  who\nconfessed before him “whether he was under any fear  or  pressure  or  given\nany  inducement  for  making  the  confession”.   After  completion  of  his\nrecording in his own handwriting  and  after  explaining  the  same  to  the\naccused in the language known to him,  he  obtained  the  signature  of  the\naccused on all the pages.  After satisfying the accused  about  confessional\nstatement made and the procedure followed, he used to handover  the  custody\nof the said accused  to  the  police  officer  concerned.

He also informed the  Court  that  he  had  issued  the  necessary\ncertificate as required under Rule 15  of  the  Rules.   He  also  issued  a\ncertificate regarding the  voluntariness  of  the  confession  made  by  the\naccused and the correctness of the record of the same prepared by  him.

For a further query,  he  also  clarified  that\nZone IV office is different office then  the  Matunga  Police  Station.

He was posted as DCP in Bombay from April,  1992,\nup till December, 1995.

He  admitted  that  he  had  supervised  one   case\nregistered with Worli Police Station then under  his  jurisdiction  and  one\ncrime registered in  connection  with  the  serial  bomb  blasts  which  had\noccurred in the month of  March,  1993.   He  had  recorded  confessions  of\nseveral accused persons arrested in the year 1993  in  connection  with  the\noffences for which the crimes were registered in respect of the bomb  blasts\nwhich had occurred in the month of March, 1993 in Bombay.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_339\">199)       He explained before the Court the  relevant  provisions  of  TADA\nfor recording a confession, procedure to be followed etc.  He  also  deposed\nbefore the Court that before recording a confession, he used  to  receive  a\nletter of requisition for the same.  He also  explained  that  on  each  and\nevery occasion he had explained his position to the accused who intended  to\nmake a confession and had  apprised  him  of  the  fact  that  there  is  no\ncompulsion on the part of the accused to make a confessional  statement  and\nalso informed the Court that he had also explained to each accused that  the\nconfession would be used against him and there was  no  compulsion  to  make\nsuch a statement.   He  further  explained  that  upon  production  of  each\naccused, he verified that the accused was not under compulsion and was  free\nfrom any pressure either by the investigating agency or by anyone else.   He\nalso informed the Court that  after  highlighting  all  the  procedures  and\nsatisfying himself, he allowed the accused to have 48 hours  breathing  time\nand asked the accused concerned that still if he was desirable to make  such\na statement, he was free to appear before him in his office.   His  evidence\nalso shows that whenever such accused were produced, he  would  verify  that\nno police personnel or anybody else was present in his Chamber and  recorded\nthe  confessional  statements  after  closing  the  door  and  after  proper\nverification that nobody was there inside.  He also informed the Court  that\nevery accused who made a statement was apprised of the fact of his  position\ni.e., DCP.    After making sure that the  accused  understood  his  position\nand after verifying the language in which he desired to  make  a  statement,\nhe recorded the same in his own handwriting.  He was also used to  tell  the\nrespective accused that during the said period of two days i.e.,  48  hours,\nhe would be kept at other Police Station away from the influence of I.O.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_340\">200)       He further explained that he used to  write  the  question  after\nasking the same to the accused and record the answer to  the  said  question\nafter the same was given by the accused.  He further made it clear  that  he\nwas following the same procedure while making the record on  the  typewriter\ninstead of writing the questions asked, he was dictating  the  same  to  the\ntypist.  After recording in the aforesaid manner, he  would  read  over  the\nwhole confessional statement to the accused in the language  known  to  him.\nHe would also obtain signatures on all the pages of the  concerned  accused.\nAfter satisfying the accused about the confessional statement made  and  the\nprocedure followed, he would handover the custody of  the  said  accused  to\nthe police officer concerned.

To  this,  the  prosecution\npointed out that in the instant case, the confessions of  the  accused  have\nbeen recorded  after  following  all  the  safeguards  as  enumerated  under\n<a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_368\">Section 15</a> of TADA and the rules framed thereunder.  It is  further  pointed\nout that the appellants have volunteered to confess their role in the  crime\nand they were aware of the fact that they were under no compulsion  to  make\na confession and that the same could be used against  them.   Further,  this\nCourt, in <a href=\"/doc/799818/\" id=\"a_369\">S.N. Dube vs. N.B. Bhoir</a>, (2000)  2  SCC  254  negated  a  similar\ncontention and held that no illegality or impropriety persists in  recording\nof a confession by an officer supervising the investigation:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_386\">      “28. The  confessions  have  been  held  inadmissible  mainly  on  two\n      grounds. The first ground given by the learned trial Judge is that the\n      power under <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_370\">Section 15</a> of the TADA Act was exercised either mala  fide\n      or without proper application of mind. The second ground on which they\n      are held inadmissible is that they were recorded in  breach  of  Rules\n      15(2) and  15(3)  of  the  TADA  Rules  and  also  in  breach  of  the\n      requirements of Section 164 and the High Court  Criminal  Manual.  The\n      learned trial Judge held that the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_371\">TADA Act</a> was applied  in  this  case\n      without any justification. The permission was granted in  that  behalf\n      without any application of mind. According to the  trial  court  there\n      was no material on the basis of which the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_372\">TADA  Act</a>  could  have  been\n      invoked at that stage and that most probably the said Act was  invoked\n      in order to defeat the bail application filed by two  accused  in  the\n      High Court. In our opinion the trial court was wrong  in  taking  this\n      view. We have already pointed out earlier that Deshmukh had  collected\n      enough material on the basis of which  reasonable  satisfaction  could\n      have been arrived at that the acts committed by  the  two  gangs  were\n      terrorist acts. It is no doubt true that it was  wrongly  reported  by\n      Deshmukh that <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_373\">Section 5</a> was also applicable  in  this  case  and  that\n      without proper verification sanction was granted to proceed under that\n      section also.  The  applicability  of  <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_374\">Section  5</a>  depended  upon  the\n      existence of a requisite notification by the State Government. It  was\n      wrongly reported by PI Deshmukh in his report that such a notification\n      was issued and relying upon his statement the higher officer had given\n      the sanction. Merely on this ground it cannot be said that Shinde  has\n      exercised the power under <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_375\">Section 15</a> of the TADA Act  mala  fide.  The\n      learned trial Judge has also held that it was not fair on the part  of\n      Shinde to record the  confessions  as  he  was  also  supervising  the\n      investigation. Shinde has clearly stated in his evidence that  he  had\n      made attempts to find out if any other Superintendent  of  Police  was\n      available for recording the confessions and as others had declined  to\n      oblige him he had no other option  but  to  record  them.  We  see  no\n      illegality or impropriety in Shinde  recording  the  confessions  even\n      though he was supervising the investigation. One  more  flimsy  reason\n      given by the trial court for holding that the power under  <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_376\">Section  15</a>\n      was exercised mala fide is that the  accused  making  the  confessions\n      were not told that they had been recorded under the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_377\">TADA Act</a>. No  such\n      grievance was made by the accused in  their  statement  under  Section\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_387\">      313. On the other hand, it appears  from  the  confessions  themselves\n      that the accused were made aware of the fact  that  those  confessions\n      were recorded under the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_378\">TADA Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_344\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"818231\" id=\"span_130\">203)  Further in <a href=\"/doc/818231/\" id=\"a_379\">Mohd.

PW  128\n      Satishchandra Rajnarayanlal, who was SP, CBI II, Punjab  Cell  at  New\n      Delhi in 1992 stated that he registered the offence RC  No.  6-SII/92.\n      He recorded the confessional statements of A-1 Lal Singh, Ext. 620 and\n      A-3 Tahir Jamal, Ext. 618 along with other accused.  Before  recording\n      confessional statements, he ascertained  from  every  accused  whether\n      they were voluntarily ready to give confessional statements. Necessary\n      questions were put to them and time was given to them  to  think  over\n      the matter. After being satisfied  that  they  were  willing  to  give\n      voluntary confessional  statements,  he  recorded  their  confessional\n      statements. PW 132 Padamchandra Laxmichandra Sharma, who was SP,  CBI,\n      SIC II at the relevant time stated that when he took over  the  charge\n      of this case RC No. 6-(S)/92 from Mr Satishchandra, this case  was  in\n      the last phase. Deputy SP, CBI, D.P. Singh (PW 136) had  produced  A-2\n      Mohd.

Before recording their statements,\n      he warned them of the consequences of making  confessional  statements\n      and further gave  them  time  to  think  over  the  matter.  On  being\n      satisfied  that  they  wanted  to  give  confessional  statements,  he\n      recorded  their  statements.  PW  133  Sharadkumar  Laxminarayan,  DIG\n      Police, CBI, SIC II Branch, New Delhi stated that in the year 1992  he\n      was SP in the same branch at New Delhi. On 5-11-1992 he  was  directed\n      by DIG M.L.  Sharma  to  proceed  to  Ahmedabad  in  order  to  record\n      statement of A-4 Saquib Nachan under <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_383\">Section 15</a> of the TADA Act. On 6-\n      11-1992 after reaching at Ahmedabad, Saquib Nachan was produced before\n      him. He put necessary questions to A-4 Saquib Nachan. Before recording\n      confessional  statement,  he  ascertained  from  him  whether  he  was\n      voluntarily ready to give confessional statement and warned  him  that\n      if he made confessional statement, the same can be used  against  him.\n      He also apprised the accused  that  he  is  not  bound  to  make  such\n      statement. When the accused replied  that  he  wanted  to  make  clean\n      admission of guilt, he recorded  the  confessional  statement  of  A-4\n      Saquib Nachan. From the above evidence, it is clear that Rule  15  was\n      fully  followed  by  the  witnesses,  who  recorded  the  confessional\n      statements of accused.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_395\">Observations made in para 23 are also noteworthy:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_396\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1813801\" id=\"span_132\">“23. In view of the settled legal position,  it  is  not  possible  to\n      accept the contention of learned Senior Counsel Mr Sushil  Kumar  that\n      as the accused were in police custody, the confessional statements are\n      either  inadmissible  in  evidence  or  are  not  reliable.

We are satisfied that before recording  the\nconfessional statements both the officers apprised the accused  persons  who\nwished to make the same that there is no compulsion on their part to make  a\nconfessional statement and thus also  apprised  them  that  the  confessions\nwould be used against them.  It is also clear from their evidence that  both\nof them had specifically verified whether such persons were under  coercion,\nthreat or promise at the time of making confession  and  all  of  them  were\ngiven adequate time to think it over and make a confessional statement.   It\nis also clear that after recording their confession, the same was  explained\nto them in the language known to them and in token of  the  same,  they  put\ntheir signatures and the officers’ counter signed the same.

Altaf Ali Mustaq Ali Sayed, (A-67),  in\nhis  confessional  statement  narrated  about  various  articles  and   also\nidentified the articles used for the  preparation  of  bomb.   He  made  his\nconfessional statement before Mr. P.K. Jain (PW-189), the then DCP,  Zone-X,\nBombay.  Since we are concerned about the recoveries, we are  not  adverting\nto his  entire  statement  for  the  present.    A-67  in  his  confessional\nstatement implicated A-1 at many places.  He informed the officer  that  A-1\nasked him to get the tickets confirmed for Dubai on short  notice  since  he\nwas working as a recruiting agent. For this, he assured A-1  that  it  would\nbe possible for him to arrange tickets even on  short  notice.   Thereafter,\nwhen he returned to his office, in the evening,  he  received  a  call  from\nAmjad telling him that as discussed in the morning with A-1, bags have  been\nsent for keeping the same with him.  After saying so, he brought 4  bags  in\nwhich one was a big  brown  coloured  VIP  bag,  one  small  and  one  black\ncoloured VIP like bag and two handbags tied together, from a jeep parked  in\nthe compound and handed over the same to him.  The next  day,  according  to\nhim, A-1 telephoned him and verified whether Amjad had handed over the  bags\nto him.  He answered in the affirmative then he asked to  book  4-5  tickets\nfor Dubai.  A-1 also sent the names with money through one  Rafiq  Madi  (A-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_444\">46), who was also a resident of Mahim and known to him for  the  last  10-12\nyears.  He booked 15/16 tickets for them.   Rafiq Madi, who  used  to  bring\nthe money every time, took  the  tickets.  In  his  further  confession,  he\nstated that after 10-12 days Amjad handed over three bags through Rafiq  for\nkeeping the same with him (A-67), out of them, one  was  big  and  two  were\nsmall and A-46 kept them in his office and told him  that  Yakub  Menon  had\nsent these bags and these were to be  sent  along  with  the  persons  going\nabroad.   He gave them 5 tickets in the first week  of  March  and  all  the\npersons went away but the bags remained lying there, then he spoke to  Yakub\nMemon over phone and asked as to when he  will  take  away  the  bags.   For\nthis, A-1 replied that he will take away the same in a couple of  days.   On\nthe same day, in the afternoon, at 2 p.m., A-1 called him and  directed  him\nto send those bags to him since he had nobody with  him.   Then,  at  6  ‘o’\nclock, in the evening he put all those bags in his Maruti  car  and  reached\nhis building.  He further explained that  among  those  bags,  4  bags  were\ngiven to him by Amjad and one small bag was given by Rafiq Madi.   He  could\nnot give the other 2 bags due to their  being  heavy.   When  he  asked  the\nwatchman to call Yakub bhai, at that time, a servant girl, aged about  10/12\nyears, came down with the keys of garage  and  put  those  bags  inside  the\ngarage of Yakub bhai.  When he returned to his house,  he  telephoned  Yakub\nMemon (A-1) that he had given 5 bags to his watchman and he had put them  in\nhis garage.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_445\">230)  Thereafter, he  went  to  Borivali  where  he  heard  that  bombs  had\nexploded at several places in Bombay on Friday i.e. 12.03.1993.   After  2-3\ndays, when he read the newspaper and  came to know that Yakub Memon and  his\nmen were behind the blasts then he got very scared.    The  other  two  bags\nwere lying in his office.  He further stated  before  the  DCP  that  during\nthis period, Amjad had gone to Karachi and  London  on  21/22nd  March.   He\ngave both the bags to  Yakub  Memon  (A-1)  through  a  Taxi  Driver,  viz.,\nMohammed Hanif, who used to handle all his parties  etc.  and  told  him  to\nkeep those bags with him and return as and when  required  or  when  he  was\nasked for the same.  He also stated that the police came to  his  office  on\n26.03.1993, at about 5 ‘o’ clock and inquired about  the  bags  which  Amjad\nhad given to him and he explained to them in  detail.   Later,  he  realized\nand believed that the bags kept in his office by Yakub Memon  through  Amjad\ncontained gun powder, arms and ammunitions and he and his men used all  that\nfor the bomb blasts in Bombay.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_372\">231)  In his confessional statement before the recording officer, he  stated\nthat, at first, A-1 told him that it contained office  documents  but  later\nhe informed him that it contained weapons etc. to take revenge  against  the\nloss of Muslims in Bombay riots.  Later, he informed A-1  not  to  implicate\nhim and not to create any problem for him.  On this, A-1 told  him  to  keep\nthose two bags for few more days.  After this, when Rafiq  came  to  keep  3\nbags with him, he asked him what was contained in these bags  as  they  were\nvery heavy, at that time, he told him that the bags  contained  bullets  and\ngrenades etc. for some work in Bombay.  He informed the officer that he  had\nno other role except for keeping those bags in his office.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_373\">232)  The next witness heavily relied upon by the prosecution  is  ‘Mohammed\nHanif Usman Shaikh (PW-282)’.  According to him, he  had  been  residing  at\nBombay for the last 30 years and had been plying a  taxi  for  the  last  10\nyears.   He  admitted  in  his  evidence  that  he  knows  Altafbhai  (Altaf\nPassportwala) and he identified Altafbhai in the  Court  and  also  informed\nhis full name as Altaf Ali Mustaq  Ali  Sayeed.   He  further  informed  the\nCourt that Altafbhai gave him 2 suit cases in his office when  he  had  been\nto the said office at 09:00 p.m., on 22.03.1993.  Both  the  said  suitcases\nwere given to him in a closed condition.  Altafbhai told  him  to  keep  the\nsaid suit cases and informed him that it contained fax machines.   Both  the\nsaid suitcases were of light brown colour.   While  describing  further,  it\nwas stated that 1 suitcase was of bigger in size while another  one  was  of\nsmaller in size.  He further explained that since Altafbhai was  not  having\nplace to keep the said suitcases, he had given the same to him  for  keeping\nthe same for a few days.  Accordingly, he brought the said suitcases to  his\nhouse.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_374\">233)   In continuation of his evidence, he stated  that  on  26.03.1993,  at\nabout 10:30 p.m., 4/5 policemen along with Altafbhai came to his house.   On\nseeing him, Altafbhai told him to return the bags given by him.   Though  an\nobjection was raised about the  said  question,  the  Designated  Court  has\nrightly clarified that the answer was allowed with  the  limited  object  to\nshow only a fact that Altafbhai had made a  statement.   Thereafter,  PW-282\ndeposed that he took out the bags which were under the  Sofa  and  gave  the\nsame to police persons who had accompanied Altafbhai (A-67).  Since  he  was\nnot having the keys, he was unable to produce the same when he was asked  by\nPolice Officer Mahabale.  Thereafter, the said  officer  called  a  mechanic\nand the mechanic opened both the bags by preparing the keys  for  the  same.\nAfter opening the bags, the mechanic went away.  Both  the  said  bags  were\nfound to contain hand grenades.  Both  bags  also  contained  wire  bundles.\nThe bigger suit case contained 65 hand grenades.  The  same  also  contained\n10 bundles of wire.  The smaller suit case contained 40 hand grenades and  5\nbundles of wire.  He further explained that the chits were affixed  on  each\nof the hand grenades in both the said bags.  The bundles of wire  from  both\nthe bags were kept together and wrapped in a paper.   The  said  packet  was\ntied by means of a string.  A seal was also affixed upon  the  said  packet.\nThe hand grenades from both the bags were of similar size.   The  same  were\nof green colour.  Each bundle of wire contained  wires  of  green,  red  and\nyellow colour.  The witness deposed that he had seen the  suit-cases  before\nthis day.  Accordingly, the suit cases were marked as Article  Nos.  42  and\n43 after showing the same to him.  He mentioned that he had  seen  both  the\nsaid suitcases in the year 1993 and had seen both the  said  suit  cases  on\n22.03.1993.  He reiterated that he had seen the said suit cases on the  said\nday in the office of Altafbhai.  Thereafter, the said suitcases  were  given\nto him by Altafbhai.  When a specific  question  was  put,  namely,  whether\nArticle Nos. 42 and 43 shown to him had any connection  with  the  suitcases\ngiven to him by Altafbhai, he answered that  the  same  were  the  suitcases\nlike these suitcases.  He again reiterated that suitcases  Article  Nos.  42\nand 43 were the suitcases given to him by Altafbhai.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_375\">234)   In the cross-examination, he mentioned that the  hand  grenades  from\nthe bigger suitcase were counted in his presence  and  asserted  that  after\ncounting the same they were found to be 65 in number.   He  also  reiterated\nthat thereafter 65 labels were prepared and signatures  of  panch  witnesses\nwere obtained upon each of the said labels.  After affixing of the  said  65\nlabels one by one on each of  the  said  hand  grenades,  the  labeled  hand\ngrenades were kept in a bigger suit case.  He also asserted  that  the  said\nlabeled hand grenades or any hand grenade out of them was not  removed  from\nthe said bigger suitcase after the same were kept in the same  up  till  the\nsaid bag was removed from his house by  the  police.   Before  removing  the\nbigger suit case from his house, he stated  that  the  same  was  locked  by\nmeans of a key which was prepared by  the  mechanic  for  opening  the  said\nsuitcase.  He also stated  that  the  bigger  suitcase  was  sealed  in  his\npresence in such a manner that contents thereof  could  not  be  removed  by\nanybody without tampering or breaking the seal  affixed  on  the  said  suit\ncase.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_376\">235)  Regarding the smaller box, he stated that in the same manner  40  hand\ngrenades were found from the smaller  bag  and  after  that  the  same  were\nlabeled.  The said bag was also locked by means of a  key  prepared  by  the\nmechanic for opening the said bag.  He also stated that  the  said  bag  was\nalso sealed in such a manner that the contents thereof could  not  be  taken\nout without damaging the intact seal affixed to  the  said  bag  or  without\nbreaking the said bag.  He  also  stated  that  none  of  the  labeled  hand\ngrenades kept in the said bag was removed after the same were  kept  in  the\nsaid bag, after labeling and uptill the said small bag (suitcase) was  taken\nout of his house by the police.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_377\">236)   He further stated that in the said night, he had seen only  105  hand\ngrenades and out of them 65 hand grenades were kept in bigger  suitcase  and\n40 hand grenades were kept in the smaller suit case.  Since he disputed  the\nnumber of hand grenades, labeling and locking  in  cross  examination,  with\nthe permission of the Court, the Special  Public  Prosecutor  put  questions\nregarding happenings at Mahim Police Station in  the  month  of  Feb./March,\n1993 and the circumstances  in  which  the  statement  of  the  witness  was\nrecorded by the police and the reason for which he had  deposed  before  the\nCourt.  In respect of a suggestion that he had made such a  wrong  statement\nat the instance of accused Altafbhai (A-67) and his agents,  he  denied  the\nsame.  Regarding the acceptability or its evidentiary  value  regarding  the\nnumber of hand grenades is to be discussed in the coming paragraphs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_378\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1236962\" id=\"span_145\">237)  Regarding recoveries, the prosecution also relied on the  evidence  of\n‘Ramesh Manohar Parkunde (PW-541)’.  According  to  him,  in  the  month  of\nMarch 1993, he was attached to the DCB CID, Unit VIII as  P.I.   He  deposed\nbefore the Court that on 24.03.1993, senior <a href=\"/doc/1236962/\" id=\"a_431\">P.I. V. S.

After  taking  charge  of  the\nsaid investigation, he registered C.R. No. 77 of  1993  as  a  corresponding\nC.R. No. for the said  crime.   On  going  through  the  earlier  papers  of\ninvestigation, he noticed a panchnama  dated  23.03.1993  affected  at  L.T.\nMarg Police Station.  He took charge of the articles recorded  in  the  said\npanchnama and kept the same in the  Strong  Room  of  DCB,  CID.   The  said\narticles were suit cases, AK-56 rifles, ammunitions and hand  grenades  etc.\nHe further informed that on 24.03.1993, he visited the place from where  the\nsaid articles were seized and made a thorough inquiry regarding  the  manner\nin which the said articles came to the said spots.  He further  stated  that\non 27.03.1993, he handed over all live hand grenades seized under  Panchnama\nExh. 728 to P.I. Chaugule of B.D.D.S for defusing the  same.   On  the  same\nday, he had also  given  him  all  the  detonators  seized  under  the  same\npanchnama for diffusing.  He had requested the said squad for returning  the\nsaid hand grenades and detonators after diffusing the same.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_379\">238)        PW-541 forwarded the seized articles to FSL for  examination  by\npreparing necessary  forwarding  letter  and  described  the  articles  sent\ntherein.  On going through the office copy of the said letter, he  explained\nthat on the said day, he had sent in all 11 sealed packets to  the  FSL  and\nout of them 4 articles were sealed  gunny  bag  packets  and  other  7  were\nsealed bags with each packet containing the articles  as  described  in  the\nsaid forwarding letter.

The letter shown to him containing the  said  acknowledgement\nof FSL is marked as Exh. 1846.  According to him, since  the  said  articles\nwere in large quantity, he had personally taken those articles to  the  FSL.\nOn 02.04.1993, he had taken out the said articles from the Strong Room.   He\nasserted that the said articles were found in perfectly sealed  labeled  and\npacked condition in which the same were deposited in the strong room,  i.e.,\nthey were in the same condition in which he  had  received  them.   He  sent\nthose articles in  the  same  condition  to  the  FSL.   On  27.04.1993,  he\nreceived a report from Chemical Analysor regarding the articles sent by  him\nfor examination.

Public Prosecutor\n      CBI, STF Mumbai”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_389\">240)   The  statements  of  various  accused,  particularly,  A-10  and  the\nevidence of PW-282 as well as PW-541 coupled with the affidavit sworn by PW-\n541 and in the light of the principles to be followed for a valid  panchnama\nwhich we  have  discussed  earlier,  we  are  satisfied  that  though  minor\ndiscrepancies are there, according to us, on this ground we  cannot  destroy\nthe entire prosecution case.  In view of the fact that the  prosecution  has\nled ample corroborative evidence, which we have  discussed  in  the  earlier\nparagraphs, we  are  of  the  view  that  the  Designated  Court  was  fully\njustified in relying on those recoveries  while  accepting  the  prosecution\ncase.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_390\">Final Analysis relating to A-1\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_391\">241)  From the total  appreciation  of  the  evidence  as  produced  by  the\nprosecution in support of the case against A-1, an offence of conspiracy  is\nclearly made out.  The evidence in respect  of  A-1  is  in  the  nature  of\nconfessions  made  by  the  co-accused  persons,  the  testimonies  of   the\nprosecution witnesses and documentary evidence on record and recoveries.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_392\">a)    A10 in his confessions  has  categorically  stated  that  A-1  is  the\nyounger brother of Tiger Memon.  It was  A-1  who  attended  many  telephone\ncalls at the Tiger’s residence.  On 10/11.02.1993,  A-1  handed  over  three\ntickets to Dubai and three passports to A10 asking him to pick up A-100,  A-\n16 and Salim from Midland Hotel and handover the tickets  and  passports  to\nthem and also directed to drop them at the airport by taxi,  all  of  which,\nwas duly done by A-10.  He further stated that at the  airport,  Tiger  told\nthem that he should keep in touch with A-1 and in case  of  any  requirement\nof money he should get the money from Choksi (A-97).  On 13th February,  A-1\ndirected A-10 to collect Rs. 1 crore  from  Choksi  (A-97)  for  him.   A-10\ncollected the said money along with co-accued Abdul Gani (A-11), Parvez  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_393\">12), Md. Hussain, Salim and Anwar Theba  (AA).   On  17/18th  February,  A-1\ndirected A-10 to remain with Rafiq Madi (A-46).  On the next day,  A-10  and\nA-46 picked up Irfan Chougule (AA) from Mahim and Shahnawaz (A-29)  and  his\ncompanion from Bandra Reclamation and dropped them at the Airport.   It  was\nA-1 who directed A-10 to transfer rupees 25 lakhs from  Tiger’s  account  to\nIrani’s account and also to transfer Rs. 10 lakhs to Ohalia’s account  which\nwas duly done by A-10.  The  timing  of  these  transfers  if  seen  in  the\ncontext of activities being carried out contemporaneously  was  for  meeting\nthe expenses for achieving the objects of conspiracy, to meet  the  expenses\nincurred for admitting of co-conspirators and also to meet the  expenses  to\nbe incurred during the abscontion period.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_394\">b)    In the same way, A-11, in his confession specifically stated  that  on\n27th/28th January    A-1 was present at Al-Hussaini Building with other  co-\naccused, i.e., A-46, A-15, A-12, A-52.  On 07.03.1993, A-11 was  present  at\nAl Hussaini Building along with Tiger, Shafi, Essa (A-3), A-7, A-5 and A-6.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_395\">c)    (A-46), in his confession referred to  the  role  of  A-1  apart  from\nmentioning that he is the  younger  brother  of  Tiger  Memon.   He  further\nconfessed that he used to drive Tiger’s blue  Maruti-800  for  attending  to\nall business activities.  On  8th  or  9th  February,  he  handed  over  Rs.\n50,000/- to him which was in turn  given  to  Altaf  Passportwala.   Between\n14/15th February, Anwar filled up brown  coloured  substance  in  three  VIP\nsuitcases from the secret cavity of the jeep at the instructions of  A-1  in\nhis presence.  Next day, A-1 gave Rs. 62,000/- to Rs. 63,000/- to him to  be\ngiven to A-67.  On  17th  February,  A-1  handed  over  five  passports  and\ntickets to Anwar for Yeda Yakub and others for  their  departure  to  Dubai.\nThe next day, on the directions of A-1, A-46 dropped  Irfan  Chougule  (AA),\nAsgar Yusuf Mukadam (A-10) and Shahnawaz at the Airport for their  departure\nto Dubai.  On 14th, he was given Rs. 4 lakhs by  A-1  after  collecting  the\nsaid amount from Choksi A-97.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_396\">d)    A-67 in his confession referred to the role of A-1.   A-1  asked  A-67\nabout the bags that have been delivered to him by Ajmal.   It  was  A-1  who\narranged for tickets for some ten accused through him by sending money  etc.\n A-1 sent three bags through A-46 to accused A-67 for safe  keeping  of  the\nsame which contained arms and ammunitions.  A-1 instructed A-67  over  phone\nfor sending the bags  to  Al-Hussaini  i.e.  residence  of  Memon’s  family.\nEarlier, A-1 had asked A-67 to keep the bags.  When A-67 told  A-1  that  he\nmay be implicated, A-1 replied that he need not worry.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_397\">e)    The confessional statement of A-97 clearly establishes that Tiger  had\nan account with him in which various amounts totaling about Rs.161.48  lakhs\nwere deposited by A-26 at the behest of Tiger  Memon  (AA)  which  was  also\ncontrolled by A-1.  It is relevant to mention that  on  12.02.1993,  at  the\ntime of departure to Dubai,  Tiger  told  A-10  that  he  should  remain  in\ncontact with A-1 and should bring money  for  him  from  A-97  in  case  A-1\nneeded money.  From the above, it could safely be inferred that the  account\nmaintained with A-97 by Tiger Memon was being used for meeting the  expenses\nincurred for achieving the  objects  of  criminal  conspiracy  and  A-1  was\nhandling it through the other co-conspirators.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_398\">242)  Confessional statements of A-10, A11 and A-46 clearly reveal that  the\nrelevant role of collecting money was played by A-10 at the behest  of  A-1.\nIn the said context, the material contained in the confession of  A-10  that\nwhile leaving for Dubai, Tiger Memon told him to remain in  touch  with  A-1\nand having further told that in the event of A-1 requiring  any  money  A-10\nshould collect the same from A-97 clearly reveals that  A-1  himself  having\nnot collected the money from A-97  but  he  was  using  A-10  for  the  said\npurpose and was actively involved in day-to-day  activities.   The  same  is\nfurther clear in the confession of A-10 which reveals that after A-1  having\ntold him to bring about an amount of Rs. 1 lakh from  A-97,  the  manner  in\nwhich the said amount was brought by A-10 by going  to  the  house  of  A-97\nalong with A-11, A-12 and two more persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_399\">243)  Apart from the above evidence, Asif Sultan Devji (PW-341)  and  Massey\nFernandes (PW-311) have deposed about booking of 12  tickets  and  1  ticket\nrespectively at the instance of A-67.  It is relevant to note that  A-67  in\nhis statement under Section 313 of the Code has admitted having  booked  the\ntickets for Dubai through the said witnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_400\">244)  PW-2, Approver had categorically stated that A-1, at the  instance  of\nTiger, gave air tickets to Javed which  were  of  A-100,  A-52,  A-60,  A-32\nbesides for himself.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_401\">245)  It has also come in the evidence of S. P. Udayavar  (PW-441)  that  at\nthe instance of A-1, in January and  March,  1993,  he  booked  tickets  for\nDubai vide Exh. 1421.  PW-441 had  categorically  stated  that  the  tickets\nbooked by him were collected by a person from  Tejarath  International  sent\nby A-1.  All the above details clearly show that the tickets booked by  A-67\nand others at the behest of A-1 were for the co-accused, who went  to  Dubai\nand, subsequently, to Pakistan for weapons training  as  revealed  in  their\nconfessional  statements  and  evidence  of  PW-2.   All  this   information\nemanated not only from the accused  in  their  confessional  statements  but\nalso from the persons who were in charge  of  issuance  of  tickets  at  the\ntravel agencies and Airport.  In the  light  of  evidence  of  PW-441  about\nbooking of tickets by A-1 in the account of Tejarath  International  coupled\nwith the confession of co-accused A-14, A-94, A-49 and A-39 regarding  their\nvisits to Dubai during the relevant time, establish that A-1 had booked  air\ntickets  for  the  co-conspirators  mentioned  above.   The  examination  of\nVijayanti B. Dembla (PW-313) and Nitin K More (PW-310) establishes  that  it\nwas A-1 who was booking tickets and used to send  his  employee  to  collect\nthem from East West Travels.   The  examination  further  reveals  that  the\noffice of his firm was burnt in the riots and he started  working  from  his\nresidence at the Al-Hussaini Building.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_402\">246)  It is also seen from the confession of A-67 that  A-1  had  given  him\nfour bags on the first occasion which were containing ammunitions.   On  the\nsecond occasion, A-46 had delivered three more suit cases to A-67  and  upon\nbeing asked by him, A-46 stated that the suit cases  were  containing  round\nbombs etc.  Thus, A-67, in all had received 7 bags  from  A-1  through  A-46\nwhich containing arms/ammunition etc.  A-67, thereafter, returned five  bags\nto A-1 that included four bags which were received  on  the  first  occasion\nand  one  of  the  three  received  on  the  second  occasion.   The   above\nconfessional statement of A-67  corroborated  the  evidence  of  Akbar  Khan\nAbusama Khan (A-37). A-46 in his confessional statement  also  stated  about\nthe delivery of three suit cases to A-67 by A-1.  Though some  discrepancies\nare there, in the light of the abundant materials, if  we  read  the  entire\nconfessional statement of A-67, those were not of much importance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_403\">247)  It is further seen that in all important meetings  with  Tiger  Memon,\nparticularly, at the residence Al-Hussaini, A-1 used to interact  with  him.\nIt is further clear that the confessional  statement  of  A-67  corroborated\nthe evidence of PW-37, PW-506 and PW-282.  It  has  also  come  in  evidence\nthat A-1 was in possession of handgrenades and electronic  detonators  which\nwere concealed in the jeep and which were delivered to A-67  in  three  suit\ncases by A-1 through A-46.  It is also seen  from  the  evidence  of  PW-87,\ndriver working for A-5 and PW-630 Manager of  Hind  Automobile  and  Company\nthat the Maruti Car  bearing  No.  MP-09-H-0672  belonged  to  A-1  and  the\nevidence also establishes that he is the owner of  the  said  vehicle  which\nwas involved in the said bomb blast.  It  has  been  proved  that  the  said\nmaruti car of blue  colour  was  planted  at  Bombay  Stock  Exchange  which\nexploded at 0330 hours killing 84 persons, injuring 270 persons and  causing\nloss of property worth Rs. 5 crores.  The number plate  (<a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_432\">Art.  227</a>)  bearing\nMP-09-H-0672 was seized from the place  of  occurrence  by  Deputy  Manager,\nBombay Stock Exchange (PW-82). Engine No. and Chassis No. were seized by PW-\n86  and  PW-370  respectively.   The  said  maruti  car  was  purchased   by\nShafizarimal in the beginning of the year  1992  through  Sulaiman  Mohammed\nLakdawala (PW-365) and thereafter, it was changed fom hand to hand and  this\ncar was used to blast Bombay Stock Exchange building.  This car was used  by\nTiger Memon and A-1 for explosion.  This is evident  from  the  evidence  of\nPWs 87 and 630.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_404\">248)  We have already noted that the confessions of A-10, A-11, A-46 and  A-\n97 are voluntary confessions and the same have  been  properly  recorded  by\nrecording officers and the same being not liable to  be  discarded.   Merely\nbecause confession of A-1 is not on record, i.e., the  said  accused  having\nnot made a confession, the  same  cannot  be  considered  as  a  factor  for\nterming other evidence led by the prosecution as a weak type of evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_405\">249)  The material portion  in  the  confessions  of  A-10,  A-11  and  A-46\nclearly reveal the relevant role  of  collecting  money  paid  by  the  said\naccused at the behest of A-1.  The oral and documentary evidence led  in  by\nthe prosecution clearly prove that A-1 was  not  only  associated  with  his\nbrothers and other accused but had  also  participated  in  the  conspiracy.\nSeveral co-accused,  particularly,  A-10,  A-11,  A-46  and  A-97  in  their\nconfessional statements unequivocally referred to the role of  A-1  and  his\nparticipation in all aspects.  The prosecution has  also  proved  recoveries\nof incriminating  articles  like  hand  grenades  etc.,  and  also  for  the\npurchase of air tickets, getting passports and visas  for  the  persons  who\nwent  to  Pakistan  via  Dubai  for  training  in  handling  of   arms   and\nammunitions.  Apart  from  the  categorical  statement  of  co-accused,  the\nprosecution has also examined the  independent  witnesses  from  the  travel\nagencies and other authorities.  Apart from this, there are  ample  evidence\nto show that he was incharge of all money transactions  and  monitoring  the\nactivities of all the persons concerned in the  movement.   The  prosecution\nhas also established that A-1 owns a blue Maruti  Car  which  was  used  for\ncarrying explosives and detonators one day before the blast  took  place  on\n12.03.1993.  A-1 left for Dubai on 11.03.1993 with the Indian  Passport  and\nthereafter he entered Pakistan with Pakistani Passport.  Though he  was  not\none among the persons who carried arms and ammunitions used  for  the  blast\nbut it was he who stood behind  them  from  starting  till  the  end,  viz.,\nconspiracy, planning and making all the  arrangements  for  sending  certain\npersons to Pakistan for training in handling of arms  and  ammunitions.   We\nare satisfied that the prosecution has established all the  charges  leveled\nagainst A-1 and the Desginated Court,  after  analysing  all  the  materials\nincluding oral and  documentary  evidence  and  the  independent  witnesses,\nrightly convicted him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_406\">250)  A perusal of the above confessions by the co-conspirators  would  show\nthat the appellant (A-1) was playing a key role in furtherance of the  above\nsaid conspiracy.  The above evidence along with further material  relied  on\nby the prosecution show that A-1 also played an active  role  in  generation\nand management of funds for achieving the object behind the  conspiracy  and\nin all subsequent events.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_407\">                    Criminal Appeal Nos. 609-610 of 2008\n\n\nZakir Hussain Noor Mohd.

He also submitted that they had no intention  to\ngo to Dubai and to attend weapons training at  Islamabad.   Their  main  aim\nwas to secure some job at Dubai.  He  also  pointed  out  that  though  they\nparticipated in the smuggling activities of the Tiger Memon group, they  had\nno intention to involve in the terrorist act as claimed by the  prosecution.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_425\"> According to the counsel, though the prosecution has relied  on  their  own\nconfessional statements inasmuch as all of them have  retracted  from  their\nstatements, there is no need to give importance to  those  confessions.   He\nalso prayed that considering their poverty and also  that  at  the  relevant\ntime they were in search  of  some  job  for  their  livelihood,  the  death\nsentence imposed by the Special Court is not warranted.

The participation of the appellants (A-32,  A-36  and  A-39)\nin these meetings  is  a  physical  manifestation  of  the  agreement.   The\nagreement to commit an illegal act  can  also  be  inferred  from  the  acts\ncommitted  by  the  appellants,  viz.,  receiving  training   in   Pakistan,\nparticipating in filling RDX in vehicles in the  intervening  night  between\n11/12.03.1993 and throwing of hand grenades at  the  Fishermen’s  Colony  at\nMahim on 12.03.1993 causing death  of  3  persons  and  injuring  6  others.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_427\">The object behind the conspiracy is the ultimate aim of the  conspiracy  and\nmany means may be adopted to achieve this ultimate object.

It  is\nfurther contended that he was forced to go to Pakistan  since  his  passport\nwas taken from him in Dubai, and  accordingly,  he  had  no  choice  but  to\nfollow the instructions.  He thus did  not  willingly  participated  in  the\nconspiracy but was forced to carry out conspiratorial acts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_611\">276)  As against this argument, learned senior counsel for the  CBI  pointed\nout that this line of defence has never been urged by the  appellant  before\nthe trial Court.  It  is  further  pointed  out  that  had  there  been  any\ncompulsion, the appellant could have opted out of the  conspiracy  upon  his\nreturn from Dubai, which he did not do.  Further, on a holistic  reading  of\nthe entire body of evidence, it is clear that from the very  beginning,  the\nappellants have willingly participated in the successful  execution  of  the\nobject of conspiracy.  The argument of coercion is a  belated  argument  and\nnecessarily a product of afterthought.  It is further  contended  on  behalf\nof the appellant  (A-32)  that  the  reasons  for  his  involvement  in  the\nconspiracy were (i)  money,  (ii)  provocation,  and  (iii)  riots.   It  is\nfurther contended that there is no record anywhere that  someone  will  take\ncare of the family of the appellant (A-32) after  the  blasts.   In  such  a\nsituation, appellant  would  not  have  willingly  participated  in  such  a\nconspiracy without having  thought  about  his  family.  In  reply,  learned\nsenior counsel for the CBI contended that he  was  fully  conscious  of  the\nconspiratorial acts and  willingly  participated  in  the  conspiracy.   The\nloss, if any, suffered by the appellant during the riots  does  not  justify\nhis terrorist act of killing innocent people.  The fact that  appellant  (A-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_612\">32) was fully conscious of his acts is further established from his  conduct\nsubsequent to the incident, wherein he  traveled  to  Karnataka  immediately\nafter the blasts in order to evade arrest.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_613\">277)   The  fact  that  appellant  (A-32)  was  actively  involved  in   the\nconspiratorial acts is clear from his own confession wherein he  has  stated\nthat after their return to Dubai from Pakistan,  he  along  with  other  co-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_491\">conspirators took oath on holy Quran that they will  take  revenge  for  the\nBombay riots and will not disclose the training in Pakistan to anyone.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_492\">278)  All the aforesaid acts clearly establish the fact that the  appellants\nknowingly and willingly participated in the  conspiratorial  acts  and  were\nfully aware and conscious of the fact that  they  were  participating  in  a\nconspiracy with a grave design.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_493\">279)  It is further contended by the counsel for the appellants that the Al-\nHussaini building is located in  a  densely  populated  area  within  a  few\nhundred meters of Mahim Police Station and it is strange  that  neither  the\nstatement of the security guard was recorded nor any of the  neighbours  saw\nanyone  filling  RDX  in  vehicles  in   the   intervening   night   between\n11/12.03.1993.  Therefore, learned counsel  for  the  appellants  vehemently\ncontended that the prosecution story is fabricated and no  reliance  can  be\nplaced on it.  But it is amply clear  from  the  materials  on  record,  the\nconfessional statements of the appellants and other  co-accused,  deposition\nof prosecution witnesses and the testimony of the Approver (PW-2)  that  RDX\nwas filled in vehicles which were  parked  in  the  garages  at  Al-Hussaini\nbuilding.  The aforesaid acts were the  result  of  a  conspiracy  and  were\ncarried out in a covert manner in the night at the Al Hussaini Building.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_494\">280)  It is further  contended  by  the  appellant  (A-32)  that  there  are\nmaterial inconsistencies between his confession and that of A-39  that  A-32\nwent to Mahim on 12.03.1993 in a blue Maruti car while A-39 stated  that  he\nwent in a white Maruti car to Mahim.  In  our  considered  view,  these  are\nminor inconsistencies which do not go to the root of the matter  since  both\nthe abovesaid accused have admitted to have gone to  Mahim  on  the  fateful\nday in a Maruti car.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_495\">281)  It is further contended by the counsel for the  appellants  that  PW-5\nis not an independent  witness  but  is  an  interested  witness  since  his\nbrother-in-law and sister-in-law sustained injuries in the blast  at  Mahim.\nIn the light of the materials placed, we hold that the testimony of PW-5  is\nconvincing and even the credibility of the witness has not  been  shaken  in\nthe cross-examination.  The testimony of  Laxman  Patil  (PW-5)  is  further\ncorroborated by the testimony of Santosh Patil (PW-6).   A  perusal  of  all\nthe above materials clearly shows that the prosecution has  established  all\nthe charges and the Designated Court rightly convicted them for the same.</p><pre id=\"pre_4\">\n\n                    Criminal Appeal Nos. 628-629 of 2008\n\n\nMohammed Mushtaq Moosa Tarani (A-44)    …..

The fact  that  the  appellant  (A-44)  knowingly\ncommitted the overt act of planting the bomb  at  Hotel  Centaur,  Juhu,  is\nevident from his own confession.

In reply, learned senior counsel for  the  CBI\nsubmitted  that  a  voluntary  and  free  confession,  even   if   retracted\nsubsequently, can be relied upon. It is also relevant to point out that  the\nretraction allegedly made by the  appellant  also  fails  to  pin-point  the\nreason behind failure  to  make  complaint  to  the  authorities  or  police\nofficers  or  any  other  authority  including  the  court   regarding   his\nsignatures being obtained on blank papers and/or the papers containing  some\ntyped material and the reason to effect the said signatures.  In this  case,\nthe Designated  Court  rightly  relied  upon  the  original  confession  and\ndiscarded the subsequent retraction.

He then deposed that it was MH-05-TC-16.\nIt is relevant to point out that  the  keys  which  were  recovered  at  the\ninstance of the appellant (A-44) belonged to  the  same  scooter  which  was\nplanted by the  appellant  at  Zaveri  Bazaar  and  was  laden  with  highly\nexplosive substances.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_588\">299)  From the evidence discussed above, it is established that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_752\">(i)   The appellant (A-44) actively participated in the conspiracy;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_753\">(ii)  He was an old associate of Tiger Memon;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_754\">(iii) He agreed with the object of conspiracy in the meeting held  at  Hotel\n      Taj Mahal and performed  several  overt  acts  pursuant  to  the  said\n      agreement;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_755\">(iv)  He associated himself with Tiger Memon (AA) and  on  his  instructions\n      with Anwar (AA).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_756\">(v)   He was seen taking instructions and being in  association  with  Anwar\n      (AA) by several co-conspirators.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_757\">(vi)  In his presence, detonators were fitted in the suitcases  filled  with\n      RDX.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_758\">(vii) He planted one such suitcase laden with RDX in Room No. 3078 of  Hotel\n      Centaur, Juhu which exploded injuring 3 persons and causing damage  to\n      the property to the tune of Rs.2.10 crores;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_759\">(viii)      He parked a scooter laden with RDX in front of the  shop  of  DP\n      Jewellers, Zaveri Bazaar;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_760\">(ix)  He threw the keys of the room on the roof of a Footwear shop where  he\n      hid the clothes he was wearing at the time of  commission  of  offence\n      and also the keys of the scooter which he had parked at Zaveri  Bazaar\n      to avoid detection by police; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_761\">(x)   He went to his friend Md.

It is pointed out by  the  prosecution  that  in  the\ninstant case, after the arrest of the appellant, identification  parade  was\nconducted on 04.06.1993 by Sharad S. Vichare, Special  Executive  Magistrate\n(PW-459) wherein PWs-27 and 26 identified the appellant as  the  person  who\nhad parked the scooter filled with RDX at  Zaveri  Bazaar.   It  is  further\nsubmitted that on 07.06.1993, TIP was conducted by Vaman D.  Sapre,  Special\nExecutive  Magistrate  (PW-249)  wherein  PWs-17  and  18   identified   the\nappellant as the person who had visited the Hotel Centaur, Juhu and  planted\nthe suitcase in Room No. 3078 of the Hotel.  It is  further  submitted  that\nthe said parade was duly conducted in the presence of  panch  witnesses  and\nmemorandum panchnamas were also prepared for the same.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_763\">301)  It is further  contended  on  behalf  of  the  appellant  (A-44)  that\nNandkumar Anant Chaugule (PW-444), an officer of BDDS, forcibly  opened  the\nlock of the dickey so the question of  opening  the  dickey  with  the  keys\nrecovered by PW-454 from the roof of the footwear shop does not arise.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_764\">302)  Further, the prosecution submitted that the  appellant  (A-44),  after\nhis arrest on 18.05.1993, made a disclosure statement on 19.05.1993 and  led\nthe  police  party  to  Kwality  Footwear  shop  at  Khambekar  street,  and\nthereafter, he took the keys from its roof and further led the police  party\nto Room No. 12 of the building opposite the  shop.   It  is  further  stated\nthat the appellant then opened the lock of the room with the same  keys  and\nwent inside the room and two keys of Bajaj Scooter and other  articles  were\nrecovered from a cupboard.  Thereafter, the said keys were  handed  over  to\nthe IO who gave the same to PW-547.  In order to complete the  link,  PW-547\ncalled  Vijay  Ramji  Wala  (PW-454)  who  is  a  Supervisor  at  M/s  Vasan\nAutomobiles to check whether the keys were of the  same  scooter  which  was\nparked by the appellant at Zaveri Bazaar.  Thereafter, PW-454  inserted  the\nkeys in all the three locks of the scooter and the  same  tallied  with  the\nlocks.  Thus it was proved that the keys recovered at the  instance  of  the\nappellant belonged to the scooter  laden  with  RDX  recovered  from  Zaveri\nBazaar.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_765\">303)  It is also contended on  behalf  of  the  appellant  (A-44)  that  the\nhandwriting in which the booking was made in the  hotel  was  not  confirmed\nduring investigation.  We are unable to accept the contention  raised  since\non perusal of the entire evidence as produced  by  the  prosecution,  it  is\nestablished that the appellant planted the suitcase laden with RDX  in  Room\nNo. 3078 of Hotel Centaur, Juhu.  We are satisfied that sufficient  evidence\nhas been brought on record by the prosecution to show  that  the  said  room\nwas booked by the conspirators in a fake name for  which  payment  was  also\ndeposited in advance.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_766\">304)  It is further contended by the appellant that PW-2 (Approver) has  not\nnamed the appellant in his deposition.  The  prosecution  pointed  out  that\nthis does not have any bearing on the prosecution case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_767\">305)   We  are  satisfied  that  the  prosecution  has  produced  sufficient\nevidence against the appellant (A-44)  to  bring  home  the  charges  framed\nagainst him.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_589\">           Criminal Appeal Nos. 637-638 of 2008\n\nAsgar Yusuf Mukadam (A-10) and\nShahnawaz Abdul Kadar Qureshi (A-29)        ……..Appellant(s)\n\n                       versus\n\nThe State of Maharashtra\nThr.

Further,  it  was  contended  on\nbehalf of  the  appellants  that  the  said  witness  had  not  specifically\ndescribed/stated about the  height  of  A-10  and  thus  it  is  a  material\nomission. It was also contended that his ‘general’ description of the kurta-\npyjama worn by the accused  at  the  time  of  the  said  incident  and  not\nexplaining the details thereof is also a material  omission.  Thus,  it  was\nargued that  in  view  thereof,  the  identification  of  A-10  by  PW-3  is\ndoubtful.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_712\">321)  PW-3 was an employee of Hindustan Security  Force  which  was  engaged\nfor providing security guards to Plaza Cinema and he was ‘deputed’  and  was\non ‘duty’ as a Security Guard at Plaza Cinema.

Ramesh  Barasingh  (PW-457),  son  of  the\ndeceased Kisan Barasingh, who died due to  scalp  injury  sustained  in  the\nexplosion at Plaza Theatre proved the death of  the  said  victim  and  also\ndeposed about the charge being taken by him of the dead body  on  13.03.1993\nfrom KEM Hospital.

Further,  with\nrespect to the deposition of Narsingh Sherkhane (PW-556),  it  is  contended\nthat the said API of the  Bombay  Police  prepared  the  Panchnama  only  on\n14.03.1993 whereas the offence was committed on 12.03.1993,  and  therefore,\nthere has been delay in recording Panchnama which is a serious lapse in  the\nprocedure. It is brought to our notice that the Police had cordoned off  and\nsealed the said area so as to  ensure  that  the  scene  of  crime  was  not\ntampered with. Moreover, after several explosions in the city, there  was  a\nstate of panic and law and order situation which the  Police  were  required\nto handle as a priority.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_720\">328)  It is  further  contended  by  Ms.  Farhana  Shah  on  behalf  of  the\nappellants that no efforts were made by the prosecution or PW-557  to  trace\nthe ownership of the said Maruti Van. It is further contended  with  respect\nto PW-557 that, on inspection of the scene of offence  and  after  effecting\nthe seizure of articles therefrom, he did not mention  the  articles  seized\nand certain details while drawing up the panchnama and thus  his  deposition\ncannot be relied upon.  A perusal of the deposition of PW-557  reveals  that\nhe has duly inspected  the  scene  of  crime  and  carefully  drawn  up  the\npanchnama (Exh. 1918) mentioning all  the  details.  He  has  mentioned  the\ndetails of all the articles seized by him therein,  more  particularly,  the\nbroken parts of the said Maruti van and the number  plate  bearing  no.  MFC\n1972. Further, it is amply clear from the depositions of PWs-3  and  4  that\nthe said Maruti van came inside the  Plaza  Cinema,  they  having  seen  the\naccused in the said van and  it  has  been  significantly  proved  that  the\nappellants were inside the van and that it is the said van which caused  the\nexplosion.  It has already been proved that the  two  Maruti  Vans,  one  of\nblue and the other of red colour were  purchased  by  Mohd.  Shafi  Jariwala\n(AA) from Suleman Lakdawala (PW-365) and Kailash Baheti  (PW-342).  Further,\nthe number of blue Maruti Van is MH-13-D-385 but the number of red  coloured\nMaruti was not known as it was not registered. The delivery  of  both  these\nvans was given  by  PW-366  which  was  supplied  by  PW-365,  who  in  turn\ndelivered these vans to Shafi Jariwala.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_721\">329)  It is contended on behalf of the appellants that no evidence has  been\nbrought on record  to  corroborate  that  the  appellants  had  any  driving\nlicence. To this, prosecution pointed  out  that  A-10  has  been  duly  and\nproperly identified as the driver  of  the  said  Maruti  van  by  the  eye-\nwitnesses, viz., PWs-3 and 4. It has also been revealed by him  in  his  own\nconfessional statement as well as in the confessional  statements  of  other\nco-accused that he drove  the  car  to  Plaza  Cinema.  Notwithstanding  the\nabsence of driving licence, it has been established that  A-10  was  driving\nthe car.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_722\">330)  Chordekar (PW-361) has proved the damage caused to  the  MTNL  (public\nproperty).

Ms.  Farhana\nShah, learned counsel for the appellant (A-9) contended  that  PW-29  is  an\nunreliable witness and his deposition should be discarded since he  did  not\ndisclose the number of the scooter or inform anyone until he  had  seen  the\nappellant even after five days of the blasts on 12.03.1993.  It is  relevant\nto point out that PW-29 was also injured in the said blast  and  thereafter,\nhe went to his house. The police had cordoned off the  area.

The prosecution submits that non-identification of A-9 in  the  Court\nwould not make the deposition of PW-36 unreliable as  he  did  identify  the\nappellant (A-9) in  the  identification  parade  held  on  13.05.1993.   The\nidentification  parade  took  place  shortly  after  the  blasts   but   the\nidentification in court took place  only  on  12.01.1996,  which  is  almost\nafter three years, thus it is possible that due to  passage  of  time  PW-36\nwas unable to identify the  appellant  before  the  court.  The  prosecution\nfurther submits that this does not impeach  the  deposition  made  by  PW-36\nsince his evidence is sufficiently corroborated by the deposition  of  PW-29\nin all material aspects.    The prosecution has brought to our  notice  that\nthe identification parade dated 25.03.1993 was conducted  at  Sacred  Hearts\nHigh School by  Ram  S.

It was submitted by the prosecution  that  he\n(A-11) knew that Tiger Memon was  a  criminal  and  he  also  used  to  take\ndelivery on behalf of Tiger  Memon  in  the  hawala  transactions  and  also\nparticipated in the smuggling of silver ignots. On 27/28  January,  he  went\nto take delivery of arms and ammunitions and  explosives  along  with  other\naccused.  When the landing was delayed by 2-3 days, he  stayed  in  a  hotel\nalong with others.  The appellant  (A-11) has  admitted  in  his  confession\nthat he had seen 70 - 80 boxes of black coloured chemical, 250 -  500  hand-\ngrenades, 15-20 big pistols, 60-70 big rifles, electronic  wires,  magazines\nand rounds at the time of  landing  that  took  place  on  02/03.03.1993  at\nWaghani Tower.  From the confessional statement of   the  appellant  (A-11),\nit can be concluded that he was an integral part of the conspiracy  and  was\na very close associate of Tiger Memon and not  merely  an  innocent  servant\nwho knew nothing about the actions of his master.  It is also  evident  from\nthe fact that in his confessional statement, he has stated that he knew  the\nobject of the smuggling of arms and ammunitions, which in his words was  “to\ntake revenge of the suffering of Muslims”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_865\">361)  It has also been contended on behalf of the appellant that <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_769\">Section  15</a>\nof TADA has not been complied with and the warning required to be given  was\nnot given. However, a perusal of the same shows that the officer  had  asked\nthe appellant (A-11) if he was aware that the confession to be made  by  him\ncan be used as evidence against him in the Court. The accused  had  answered\nthe aforesaid question in affirmative. The questions that were  asked  while\nrecording the first part of the confession were:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_988\">      “whether he has any complaint against anybody?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_989\">      Ans.  No.\n\n\n      Q. Whether anyone has put any kind of pressure on  you  to  make  this\n      confessional statement?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_990\">      Ans. No.\n\n\n      Q. Whether you have been given any kind of allurement or threat?\n      Ans. No.\n\n\n      Q.  Do  you  want  to  make  your  confessional  statement/  statement\n      willingly?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_991\">      Ans. Yes.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_992\">      Q. Whether you  understand  that  you  are  not  bound  to  make  this\n      statement/confessional statement?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_993\">      Ans. Yes.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_994\">      Q. Whether you understand that it may be produced in the court  as  an\n      evidence against you in case you confess?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_995\">      Ans. Yes.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_996\">      Q. After this you will be kept at place  other  than  the  custody  of\n      Tapasi Officer. Whether you know this?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_997\">      Ans. Yes.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_998\">      Q. Do you still desire to make a confession ?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_999\">      Ans. Yes.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1000\">      Q. I do not wish to  record  your  statement  forcibly  or  under  any\n      pressure and I, therefore, give you time of 48 hours to think over the\n      same. During this you will be kept at place other than the custody  of\n      Tapasi Officer. Whether have you understood this?\n      Ans. Yes.”\n\n\n      Before recording the second part of the confession, the officer  asked\nthe following questions to the appellant.  The  questions  and  answers  are\nquoted below:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1001\">      “Q. On 15.4.93, you were produced before me and on that day  you  were\n      given time of 48 hours to think over before recording  the  statement.\n      That time limit has been expired, have you thought it over?\n      Ans. Yes.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1002\">      Q. Whether you are under any pressure  or  you  have  been  given  any\n      threat or allurement to make this confessional statement?\n      Ans. No.\n\n      Q. Whether you know that, if you make any confession, then it  may  be\n      produced in the court as an evidence against you?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1003\">      Ans. Yes.”\n\nThe above quoted conversation shows  that  the  appellant  (A-11)  had  been\ngiven due warning by the officer recording the statement that his  statement\ncan be used against him. He had also been asked if there  was  any  coercion\nor threat due to  which  he  was  giving  his  confessional  statement.  The\nquestions and answers establish that the confession made  by  the  appellant\n(A-11) was voluntary.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1004\">362)  It has also been contended by the side of the appellant  that  a  part\nof the confession was made after two months and, hence, it is a  manipulated\nconfession. This contention of the appellant (A-11) is devoid of any  merit.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_866\">The second confession  has  been  discarded  by  the  trial  court  and  the\nprosecution has also not pressed into service that  confession  before  this\nCourt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_867\">363)  Learned counsel for the appellant (A-11) has  further  contended  that\nthe confession of the appellant (A-11) was recorded in the odd hours of  the\nnight. It is pointed  out  by  the  prosecution  that  this  fact  could  be\nelicited from the officer recording the confession, who was the best  person\nto answer the query.  It was also highlighted that it was not  as  a  matter\nof routine that the confessions were recorded late at night and only  a  few\nconfessions have been recorded in the  late  hours  which  could  have  been\nexplained by the recording officer,  if  he  was  given  an  opportunity  to\nexplain in the cross examination.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_868\">364)   The said confession was sought to be retracted on 11.01.1994.  It  is\npointed out by the side of the prosecution that the  material  contained  in\nthe retraction  statement  is  vague.  It  does  not  give  any  details  or\nparticulars. The said retraction statement fails to  pin  point  the  reason\nbehind the failure of  concerned  accused  to  make  any  complaint  to  the\nauthority- higher police officers or any  other  authority  including  Court\nregarding his signatures being obtained on blank papers  and/or  the  papers\ncontaining some typed material and the reason behind  himself  being  forced\nto effect the said signatures.  It may also be  noted  that  retraction  was\nnot made at the first available opportunity by  the  accused  person.  After\narrest, the accused persons were brought before the court  number  of  times\nin 1993 and 1994 and the retraction was made many  months  after  making  of\nthe confession.  From the above  discussion,  it  is  established  that  the\nconfession of the appellant (A-11) was truthful and voluntary. It  has  also\nbeen demonstrated that the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_770\">Section  15</a>  of  TADA  have  been\ncomplied with. Hence the confession of the appellant  (A-11)  is  admissible\nas substantive evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_869\">Confessional Statement of co-accused:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1005\">365)  A perusal of the above confession of the appellant (A-11)  shows  that\nhe was playing a key role in furtherance of the  abovesaid  conspiracy.  The\nother accused, in their confessions under <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_771\">Section  15</a>  of  TADA,  have  also\ndiscussed the role played by the appellant (A-11) in the conspiracy.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_870\">Confessional statement of Mohammed Shoaib Mohammed Kasam Ghansar (A-9)\n\n      Confessional statement of A-9  under  <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_772\">Section  15</a>  of  TADA  has  been\nrecorded on 19.04.1993 and 22.04.1993 by Prem Krishna  Jain  (PW  189),  the\nthen DCP, Zone X, Bombay.

In view  of  the  fact  that  A-12  has\ngiven details about the presence and involvement of the appellant (A-11)  in\nthe conspiracy and also about  his  participation  in  the  act  of  loading\nchemicals into the vehicles,  it  cannot  be  denied  that  he  was  not  an\nintegral part of the conspiracy. The fact that A-11  was  working  in  close\nassociation with Tiger Memon and was entrusted with the task of driving  the\njeep shows the trust reposed in him by Tiger Memon. It is  just  because  of\nthe said trust, the position of responsibility commanded  by  the  appellant\nin  the  conspiratorial  design  followed.  He  played  an   important   and\nsignificant role. It cannot be said that A-12 has not given details  of  any\novert act done by A-11. A-12 has, in fact, given significant  details  about\nthe involvement of A-11 in the landings that took place and in the  movement\nof vehicles in which  cavities  were  made.  A-11  was  present  in  the  Al\nHussaini building even after the departure  of  Tiger  Memon  in  the  early\nhours of 12.03.1993.

It  is  clear  from  the\nconfession of the appellant (A-12) and the confessions of  other  co-accused\nthat the work of filling of RDX in vehicles and suitcases  was  carried  out\nin the garage of the Al-Hussaini  Building.   We  are  also  satisfied  that\nsufficient evidence is available on record to  substantiate  the  fact  that\nthe appellant (A-12) participated in filling RDX in vehicles  in  the  night\nintervening 11th/12th March, 1993.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1322\">397)  It is contended on behalf of the appellant  that  PW-8  saw  a  person\nparking the said scooter at Katha Bazaar  from  the  window  of  his  office\nwhich is at a distance of about 15-20 meters from the  road  and  therefore,\nhis statement should not be relied upon.  It is further contended on  behalf\nof the appellant (A-12) that the doctor who treated  PW-8  of  the  injuries\nsustained by him in the blast has not been examined by  the  prosecution  to\ncorroborate the evidence of PW-8.  The said contentions are also  liable  to\nbe rejected since the scooter of PW-8’s employer was  parked  close  to  the\nscooter parked by the appellant (A-12).  It is  normal  human  behaviour  to\nlook out for one’s own vehicle or employer’s vehicle and  accordingly,  PW-8\nwas attentive and had a clear sight of the  scooter.   Thus,  there  was  no\ndifficulty  in  seeing  the  appellant  parking  the  scooter  which   later\nexploded.  Further, PW-8  has  correctly  identified  the  appellant  (A-12)\nbefore  the  Court  during  the  dock  proceedings  and  also  in  the  Test\nIdentification Parade.  In addition to the same, it is relevant  to  mention\nthat PW-8 has been extensively cross-examined by the defence  on  the  point\nthat he was injured and he took  treatment  at  Dr.  Shah’s  Clinic  and  he\nwithstood  the  cross-examination  without  being  shaken.   Therefore,  the\ncredibility of the evidence of PW-8 is not affected whatsoever.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1323\">398)  It is contended on behalf of the appellant (A-12) that PW-530 had  not\nobtained the signatures of panch witnesses upon the licence and/or  that  he\nhad not recorded the Registration number  of  the  vehicle  in  the  Station\nDiary and that the panch witness was not a local panch witness and was  from\na place more than 100 kms. away.  This  submission  is  also  liable  to  be\nrejected since PW-530 clearly explained the circumstances in  which  he  had\ntaken the said panch for the panchnama, i.e., the persons who  were  fetched\nby staff from Crawford Market.  PW-530 in his  deposition  stated  that  the\ndriving licence being a plastic card, he could not obtain the signatures  on\nthe same and  the  details  of  the  driving  licence  having  already  been\nmentioned in the panchnama, he had not pasted the label of the signature  of\npanch witness upon the same and that he had mentioned in the  Station  Diary\nthe purpose of his visit and the persons accompanying him.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1324\">399)  Finally, it is contended on behalf of the appellant  (A-12)  that  the\ntestimony of PW-28 should be disregarded since he  failed  to  identify  the\nappellant (A-12) before the Court.  This contention of  learned  counsel  is\nalso liable  to  be  rejected  since  PW-28  had  correctly  identified  the\nappellant (A-12) during the test identification parade dated 07.05.1993  and\nhe failed to identify him before the Court possibly  because  his  testimony\nwas recorded after about 2 years and 9 months, i.e. on 21.12.1995.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1325\">400)  In view of the above said confessional statement of the appellant  (A-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1326\">12), the confessional statements of other co-accused persons,  as  also  the\neye-witnesses along with other witnesses duly examined  by  the  prosecution\nand recoveries made, the charges framed  against  the  appellant  have  been\nduly proved.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1032\">           Criminal Appeal Nos. 941-942 of 2008\n\n\nMohammed Farooq Mohammed Yusuf\nPawale (A-16)                                          ……..Appellant(s)\n\n                       versus\n\nThe State of Maharashtra\nthr.

Taking of oath on Quran shows  their  intent  and  determination  to\ncause damage and destruction.  Their sole aim was to  terrorise  the  people\nof the country by causing massive and  extensive  damage  to  the  financial\ncapital of the country and to destabilize the  Government  of  India.   From\nthe above confession, it is evident that he had no trace of remorse for  the\nactions committed by him.  The very fact that when the appellant  fled  from\nBombay,  he  also  suggested  A-94  to  do  the  same  which   shows   their\nincriminating post incident conduct.

Para  74\nreads as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1427\">      “After talking to Tiger Memon on telephone, Javed Chikna and all of us\n      came  downstairs.   We  met  Farooq  Pawale  (A-16).    Javed   Chikna\n      instructed Farooq Pawale to take one  Maruti  Car  800  to  Shiv  Sena\n      Bhawan, Dadar and park it near Shiv Sena Bhawan, Dadar.  Farooq Pawale\n      requested me to accompany him.  I accompanied  Farooq  Pawale  in  the\n      white coloured Maruti 800 car, I drove the Maruti  Car  to  Shiv  Sena\n      Bhawan.  The white coloured Maruti 800 car was filled  with  RDX.   We\n      were told to park the white coloured Maruti Car near Shiv Sena  Bhawan\n      to blow it up.”\n\nA-16 participated in the landing and transportation of arms and  ammunitions\nand explosives which were smuggled  into  India  at  Shekhadi  in  February,\n1993.  He visited Pakistan via Dubai for receiving training in  handling  of\narms and ammunitions and  explosives  from  the  agents  of  ISI  to  commit\nterrorist acts in India.  He attended  conspiratorial  meetings  during  the\nmonth of March 1993 at the residence of Babloo  @  Nazir  Anwar  Shaikh  and\nMobina @ Baya Musa Bhiwandiwala (A-96) for making plans to commit  terrorist\nact.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1428\">414)  He also participated along with other co-conspirators in  loading  the\nexplosives like RDX fitted with time device detonators in  various  vehicles\nduring preparation  of  vehicle  bombs  in  the  intervening  night  between\n11/12th March, 1993.  He surveyed and conducted reconaissence of  the  Stock\nExchange  Building  and  Air  India  Building  on  10.03.1993  for   causing\nexplosions there.  Therefore, it is established that the appellant was  well\naware  of  the  conspiracy  right  from  the  inception  and  also  of   the\nconsequences of his acts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1429\">415)  It is evidently clear from  the  participation  of  A-16  in  all  the\nimportant events and his presence in the  conspiratorial  meetings  that  he\nwas an integral part of the conspiracy and knew  everything  about  it.   It\nwas not the case  that  he  was  merely  following  the  instructions.   The\ntestimony of the approver corroborates the  confession  of  the  accused  as\nwell as confessions of other co-accused in all  material  particulars.   The\napprover was one of  the  conspirators  and  he  was  a  party  to  all  the\nlandings, meetings, training and also went to  plant  the  explosives  laden\nvehicle at  the  Shiv  Sena  Bhawan.   The  account  of  the  conspiratorial\nmeetings, training and other events is reliable and fits in to the chain  of\nevents which has already been established  by  the  confessions  of  various\naccused.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1102\">Other Witnesses\nDeposition of Ishwar Haralkar (PW-11)\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1103\">416)  PW-11 was a service man at Lucky Petrol Pump. He  deposed  that  while\nhe was on duty on 12.03.1993, at 2  p.m.,  the  driver  (PW-2)  of  a  white\ncoloured Maruti 800 car stopped in front of the service station. He  further\ndeposed as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1430\">(i)   PW-11 refused to allow the driver to park the car there as it had  not\n      come for servicing in the station.  There was an  altercation  between\n      PW-11 with the person (A-16) sitting next to the driver.   Ultimately,\n      PW-2 parked the said car towards the direction of Shiv Shahi Chawl  at\n      the side of petrol pump and left it there.  After half an hour,  PW-11\n      heard the sound of a big explosion and saw that the  said  Maruti  Car\n      had exploded.  He noticed that there was fire and  massive  damage  to\n      the vehicles standing nearby.  The cement roof of the service  station\n      blown up and fell on him.  He was injured and went to the doctor.   He\n      noticed complete damage to the service station and the petrol pump.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1431\">(ii)  PW-11 identified PW-2 in the identification  parade  dated  11.05.1993\n      conducted by the Special Executive Magistrate, Ram S Bhosale  (PW-460)\n      and he again identified PW-2 as well as  A-16  in  the  identification\n      parade dated 23.05.1993 conducted by SEM Moreshwar Thakur (PW-469).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1432\">(iii) The witness also identified the appellant (A-16) in the Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1433\">417)  It has been contended by  the  counsel  for  the  appellant  that  the\nperson (A-16) sitting next to the driver got off before the  white  coloured\nMaruti 800 car was parked at the side of the  Lucky  Petrol  Pump.   On  the\nbasis of this, the counsel submitted that A-16 was not responsible  for  the\nblast that took place at the Petrol Pump.  It is submitted that even  though\nthe accused (A-16) was not the  last  person  to  leave  the  car  but  most\ncertainly he went with the other person who was driving the  car  (PW-2)  to\nplant the bomb at the said Petrol Pump.  It is further submitted  that  A-16\nhad to get down from the car only because PW-11 did not permit  the  parking\nof the vehicle in front of the said Pump.  A-16 had gone along with PW-2  to\nthe place where the incident took place for  the  purpose  of  planting  the\nvehicle.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1434\">418)  It has also been contended on behalf of the appellant that the  height\nof A-16 has not been recorded and so PW-11 is not a  reliable  witness.   It\nwas submitted by the counsel that the witness has stated:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1435\">      “My statement recorded on 12.03.1993 was read over and explained to me\n      after it came to be recorded and found that it was correctly recorded.\n       (The attention of  the  witness  is  drawn  to  his  statement  dated\n      12.03.1993). In my statement recorded  by  the  Police  on  12.03.1993\n      there is no mention of the height of the person who was sitting by the\n      side of the driver.   I  cannot  assign  any  reason  why  it  is  not\n      recorded.  According to me the colour complexion of a person would  be\n      important in describing him.  In case of the  person  whom  I  noticed\n      sitting by the side of the driver in the Maruti Car on 12.03.1993, his\n      colour complexion was important feature and not his shortness.”\n\nTherefore, in view of the above statement, the witness was conscious of  the\nfact that the height was not recorded in  the  earlier  statement.   It  was\nsubmitted from  the  side  of  the  prosecution  that  for  identifying  the\naccused, it was not his height which was important but  it  was  his  colour\nand complexion which was important.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_1104\">419)  The witness has further deposed that the statement was  read  over  to\nhim and he found it to be correct.  It cannot be contended by the  appellant\nthat merely because the height of the  accused  was  not  mentioned  in  the\nearlier  statement,  the  witness  is  unreliable.  PW-11  has,   in   fact,\nidentified the accused A-16 and therefore his testimony  is  reliable.    It\nwas further contended on behalf of the appellant that  since  PW-11  was  an\ninjured witness, the doctor who treated him should have  been  examined  and\nhis non-examination would result in discrediting the witness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1105\">420)  The witness has given accurate description  of  the  accused  and  the\napprover has identified them.  The testimony of the witness is  corroborated\nby the evidence given by the accused, the approver and other witnesses.   It\nis also mentioned in his statement that  he  did  not  suffer  any  bleeding\ninjuries.  Since the witness was not seriously injured, there  was  no  need\nfor him to be admitted in a hospital and for the  Investigating  Officer  to\nexamine any doctor in this regard.  Hence, the contention of  the  appellant\nis without any basis.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1106\">Deposition of S.S. Hande (PW-12)\n      PW-12 was a police constable attached to  Dadar  Police  Station.   On\n12.03.1993, he along with PC 13196 was on duty at the Shiv Sena Bhawan.   He\nis an eye-witness to the incident.  PW-12 deposed as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1436\">(i)   Around 2 p.m., PW-12 had an altercation  with  A-16  who  was  sitting\n      next to the driver (PW-2) of white coloured Maruti Car with regard  to\n      the parking of car near Shiv Sena Bhawan.  The driver (PW-2) took  the\n      car away from there and ultimately parked it near the compound wall of\n      service station after some discussion with an employee  of  the  Lucky\n      Petrol Pump.  After parking the vehicle, both A-16 and PW-2  left  the\n      place.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1437\">(ii)  He further deposed that  after  sometime  an  explosion  occurred  and\n      there was lot of smoke in the area and  many  vehicles  and  buildings\n      were damaged.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1438\">(iii) PW-12 identified PW-2 and A-16  in  the  identification  parade  dated\n      23.05.1993 conducted by SEM Moreshwar Thakur (PW-469) who prepared the\n      memorandum Panchnama Exh. 1519 for the same.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_1107\">(iv)  The witness also identified the appellant (A-16) in the Court.\nIt was submitted by the counsel for the  appellant  that  this  witness  has\ndeposed that A-16 had an altercation with  him  regarding  parking  of  car.\nThereafter, he saw them talking to an employee of  the  Lucky  Petrol  Pump.\nAfter some time, the person sitting next to the driver  got  down  from  the\ncar.  Here again, it was contended that A-16 was not  there  until  the  car\nwas parked and so he was not responsible for the blast that  took  place  at\nthe Lucky Petrol Pump.  In view of the above,  it  is  contended  that  even\nthough he did not finally park the car,  his  intention  was  to  cause  the\nblast and he got down from it only because of the altercation. A-16  was  an\nequal participant in the planting of the car at the place of the blast.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1108\">421)  Learned counsel for the appellant has placed para No. 5 in  which  the\naccused has been identified by the witness and paragraph  No.  8  where  the\ndistinguishing marks on the face of the accused have been described  by  the\nwitness.  This supports the case of the  prosecution  that  the  eye-witness\nhas correctly identified the accused and,  therefore,  the  accused  can  be\nplaced at the scene  of  crime  on  the  date  and  time  of  the  incident.\nHowever, the counsel has not pointed out para No. 312 from the statement  of\nPW-2 which reads as “I told Farooq Pawale to  get  down  and  go  ahead  and\nengage a Taxi for us, as stated in my evidence  before  the  Court.”  It  is\nthus established that the testimony of the witness is reliable and also  the\nfact that the accused had gone to the site of the explosion along with  PW-2\nin the car in which the explosion took place.  The evidence given by PWs  11\nand 12 corroborate the  evidence  given  by  the  accused  himself  and  the\napprover.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_1109\">422)  Learned counsel for the appellant also submitted that PWs 11,  12  and\n2 have given different versions of the story  which  are  contradictory  and\nthus their statements cannot be  relied  on.   The  statements  of  all  the\nwitnesses and the confession of the accused, if read  as  a  whole,  do  not\ngive any contradictory or conflicting account,  in  fact,  they  corroborate\neach other.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1110\">Deposition of Jagannath B. Patil (PW-668)\n      PW-668 was a Police Officer who visited the said Petrol Pump after the\nblast in the presence of two panch witnesses Sudhakar Kadam and Kallapa.  He\ndrew a panchnama and seized ten Articles, viz., Articles  549-A  (colly)  to\n558-A (colly) in and around the site of explosion.  These articles  included\nburnt pieces of tar, burnt pieces of wood and mud  from  the  ditch  created\ndue  to  the  explosion.   PW-668  also  collected   samples/Articles   vide\nPanchnama Exh. 2460 in  the  presence  of  Panch  Witness  Kiran  Padhrinath\nDeshmukh (PW-666).  A Panchnama was prepared in respect  of  articles  taken\nby the Assistant Chemical Analysers from the site of  the  blast  near  Shiv\nSena Bhavan in Dadar.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1111\">Deposition of Anil Kumar V. Kamat (PW-669)\n      PW-669 was the person who sent articles like burnt  pieces  of  bones,\nskull, branches of trees, etc. to the FSL  for  its  opinion  and  has  also\ndeposed about the injuries to the persons and the deaths of the  persons  on\naccount of explosion at Lucky Petrol Pump.  The  reports  sent  by  the  FSL\nconfirm the traces of RDX which were present in the objects  collected  from\nthe scene of the blast.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1112\">Deposition of Fazal Fruitwala (PW-363)\n      PW-363 was a Car Broker.  In July, 1990, Salim Abdul  Gani  Gazi  (AA)\nhad approached him for purchasing a new white coloured Maruti 800 car.   PW-\n363 inquired with Shakil Hasam of Auto Links.  He informed Salim  Gani  that\nthe car was available.  As  asked  by  Shakil  Suleman  on  12.07.1990,  the\ndelivery order was taken from M/s Sai Service Station.  The car was  in  the\nname of the original purchaser Sultan Ali.  On the  same  day,  at  7  p.m.,\nSalim Gani had paid Rs.  1,40,000/-  inclusive  of  brokerage.   PW-363  had\nasked Salim Gani to take delivery from  Daman  Stockyard.   After  deducting\nthe brokerage, PW-363 sent the price of  the  car  to  Shakeel  Hasam.   The\nvehicle, i.e., the white Maruti Car used for the explosion was purchased  by\nSalim Abdul Gani Gazi (AA) in July,  1990  through  PW-363  and  Shakeel  S.\nHasam (PW-366).  The car  was  given  Registration  No.  MH-03-A-2143.   The\nregistration of the car was done under a fictitious name which is proved  by\nthe evidence of PW-329 who was a postman in the concerned locality.\nDeposition of Sadanand S. Paradkar (PW-329)\n      PW-329 was a Postman and was in the service of Ghatkopar Rajawadi Post\nOffice in the year 1993.  It was deposed by him that Garodia Nagar  did  not\nhave any building by name of Manohar Apartment  and,  hence,  there  was  no\nquestion of any person by name Sultan Ali residing in Flat  No.  8,  on  the\nsecond  floor  of  the  said  building.

There  was\na big hole on the 2nd floor wall of the building.  He further  deposed  that\ndamage was also caused to the buildings behind the petrol  pump  and  things\nin its vicinity.  He also gave the information regarding  the  situation  of\npetrol pump and its  vicinity  in  the  presence  of  panchas.

It was submitted by the counsel for the  appellant  that  the\nSEM was neither aware of the guidelines nor he had seen the Rules framed  by\nthe High Court of Judicature of  Bombay  regarding  the  precautions  to  be\ntaken by a person conducting the TIP.  It  is  relevant  to  note  that  the\nGovernment of Maharashtra had not issued as  such  any  guidelines  but  had\ngiven the draft memorandum for  Identification  Parade.   Therefore,  it  is\nestablished that the procedure which was required to be followed  was  known\nto the SEM and he had conducted it in accordance with the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1154\">428)  A perusal of the entire evidence above establishes the  guilt  of  the\nappellant (A-16). The confession of the appellant gives the  detail  of  all\nthe important events that took place during the  time  when  the  conspiracy\nwas in its nascent stage.  The appellant (A-16) was involved in the  landing\nof arms and ammunitions and explosives; he went to Pakistan for training  in\nusing arms and making explosives; attended crucial conspiratorial  meetings;\nwent to survey the targets;  was  also  present  in  the  meeting  when  the\ntargets were being finalized; and in  addition  to  all  these  actions,  he\nplanted explosives laden vehicles at two locations and went  to  survey  the\nthird location.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1155\">429)  All these events have been narrated by the  co-accused  also  and  the\npresence of the appellant has been narrated in the confessions of  many  co-\naccused including the ones who were an  integral  part  of  the  plan.   The\nevidence given by the approver and eye-witnesses also corroborate  the  fact\nthat the appellant had planted explosives at two locations and had  surveyed\nthe third place.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1156\">430)  The evidence of the approver, the  eye-witnesses,  experts  and  other\nwitnesses above clearly establish the involvement of A-16 in the  explosions\nthat took place at the Stock Exchange building, Air India building  and  the\nShiv Sena Bhawan.  It is established that A-16 was an active member  of  the\nconspiracy which led to the blasts at various places in  Bombay  and  caused\nmany deaths, injuries and loss to property.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1157\">431)  The evidence given by the  doctors  and  the  family  members  of  the\ndeceased show the extent of suffering that was inflicted  by  A-16  and  the\nother accused in pursuance of the conspiracy.  The quantity of RDX that  was\nused in the blasts clearly shows and establishes the fact  that  the  blasts\nwere intended to tear the economic, moral and social fabric  of  the  nation\nand to induce communal tensions.  The involvement of the  appellant  in  the\nentire conspiracy establishes the critical role played by him in the  blast.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1158\">432)  In view of the above said confessional statement of the appellant  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1159\">16), the confessional statements of other co-accused persons,  as  also  the\neye-witnesses along with other witnesses duly examined, the prosecution  has\nproduced sufficient  evidence  against  the  appellant  to  bring  home  the\ncharges framed against him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1160\">TERRORISM:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1469\">433)  The term “terrorism” is a concept that is commonly and widely used  in\neveryday parlance and is derived from the Latin word  “Terror”  which  means\nthe state of intense fear and submission to  it.   There  is  no  particular\nform of terror, hence, anything intended to create terror in  the  minds  of\ngeneral public in order to endanger the lives of the members and  damage  to\npublic property may be termed as a terrorist  act  and  a  manifestation  of\nterrorism. Black’s law dictionary defines terrorism as “the  use  of  threat\nor violence to intimidate or cause panic,  esp.  as  a  means  of  affecting\npolitical conduct” (8th edition, page 1512).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1470\">434)  Terrorism is a global phenomenon in today’s world and India is one  of\nthe worst victims of terrorist acts.  Terrorism has a long history of  being\nused to achieve political, religious and  ideological  objectives.  Acts  of\nterrorism can range from  threats  to  actual  assassinations,  kidnappings,\nairline hijackings, bomb scares, car bombs, building explosions, mailing  of\ndangerous  materials,  computer-based  attacks  and  the  use  of  chemical,\nbiological, and nuclear weapons—weapons of mass destruction (WMD).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1471\">435)  The fight against terrorism  requires  a  concerted  and  multifaceted\nstrategy at both the domestic and international levels and should involve  a\nlegal order which itself needs to be updated and elaborated upon and  should\nhence be turned into a practical tool.  There  exist  several  domestic  and\ninternational  legislations  to  counter  terrorism.   <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_949\">The   Terrorist   and\nDisruptive Activities  (Prevention)  Act,  1985</a>  (Act  31  of  1985)   which\nreceived the assent of the President on May 23, 1985 and  was  published  in\nthe Gazette of India, Extra., Part II, <a href=\"/doc/50707993/\" id=\"a_950\">Section 1</a>, dated May 23,  1985,  came\ninto force on May 24, 1985 in the whole of India for a period of two  years.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1161\">The Statement of Objects and Reasons of the said Act reads as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1472\">      “Prefatory Note — Statement of Objects and  Reasons.—  Terrorists  had\n      been indulging in wanton killings, arson, looting  of  properties  and\n      other heinous crimes mostly in Punjab and Chandigarh. Since  the  10th\n      May, 1985, the terrorists have  expanded  their  activities  to  other\n      parts of the country, i.e. Delhi, Haryana, Uttar Pradesh and Rajasthan\n      as a result of which several innocent lives have been  lost  and  many\n      suffered serious injuries. In planting of explosive devices in trains,\n      buses and public places, the object to terrorise, to create  fear  and\n      panic in the minds of citizens  and  to  disrupt  communal  peace  and\n      harmony is clearly discernible. This is  a  new  and  overt  phase  of\n      terrorism which requires to be taken serious note of  and  dealt  with\n      effectively and expeditiously.

Since  both\nthe Houses of Parliament were not in session and it was  necessary  to  take\nimmediate action, the President promulgated  the  Terrorist  and  Disruptive\nActivities (Prevention) Ordinance, 1987 (2 of 1987) on May  23,  1987  which\ncame into force w.e.f.  May  24,  1987.  However,  this  Act  repealing  the\nOrdinance, received the assent of the President of  India  on  September  3,\n1987 and was published in the Gazette of India, Extra., Part II, <a href=\"/doc/50707993/\" id=\"a_952\">Section  1</a>,\ndated September 3, 1987. The scheme of the Act 31 of  1985  and  Act  28  of\n1987 as reflected from their preambles  is  the  same.  The  scheme  of  the\nspecial provisions of these two Acts were/are “for the  prevention  of,  and\nfor coping  with,  terrorist  and  disruptive  activities  and  for  matters\nconnected therewith or incidental thereto”.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1162\"> International Conventions\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1163\">438)  There also exist  several  International  Conventions,  which  aim  to\nsuppress terrorism and define terrorist acts.  The League  of  Nations  took\nthe initiative to  formulate  the  first  Global  Convention  on  Preventing\nTerrorism and, accordingly, adopted the 1937 Convention for  the  Prevention\nand Punishment of Terrorism, which defined “acts of terrorism” as:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1478\">      “Criminal acts directed against a State and intended or calculated  to\n      create a state of terror in the minds of particular persons,  a  group\n      of persons or the general public.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1479\">439)  More recently,  several  International  Conventions  and  Multilateral\nAgreements have been entered into by States to curb global  terrorism.   The\nInternational Convention for the Suppression  of  Terrorist  Bombings,  1997\ndefines the offence of “terrorist bombing” as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1480\">      “Article 2.1 – Any person commits an offence  within  the  meaning  of\n      this Convention if that person unlawfully and intentionally  delivers,\n      places, discharges or detonates an explosive or  other  lethal  device\n      in, into or against a place or  public  use,  a  State  or  government\n      facility,  a  public  transportation  system  or   an   infrastructure\n      facility:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1481\">      a) With the intent to cause death or serious bodily injury; or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1482\">      b) With the intent to cause extensive destruction  of  such  a  place,\n      facility or system, where such a destruction results in or  is  likely\n      to result in major economic loss.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1483\">440)  The United Nations Security Council in its 2004  Resolution  denounced\n“terrorist acts” as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1484\">      “criminal acts, including against civilians, committed with the intent\n      to cause death or serious bodily injury, or taking of  hostages,  with\n      the purpose to provoke a state of terror in the general public or in a\n      group of persons or particular persons,  intimidate  a  population  or\n      compel a government or an  international  organization  to  do  or  to\n      abstain from doing any act, which constitute offences within the scope\n      of and as defined  in  the  international  conventions  and  protocols\n      relating to terrorism,  are  under  no  circumstances  justifiable  by\n      considerations of a  political,  philosophical,  ideological,  racial,\n      ethnic, religious or other similar nature.”\n\nIndia’s Contribution in Combating Terrorism\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1485\">441)   India  has  played  a  major  part  in  strengthening   international\nconsensus against terrorism in UN,  Non-Aligned  Movement  (NAM)  and  South\nAsian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC).  India  is  a  party  to\nmajor international conventions against terrorism and has also  incorporated\nthem in  domestic  legislation.   These  conventions  and  treaties  condemn\nterrorist acts and expressly state the grave concern posed by terrorism.\nTerror Attacks\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1486\">442)  Another trend common to both national and international  terrorism  is\nthe  emergence  of  terrorist  groups  motivated  by  religious  fanaticism.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1164\">Whenever the perpetrators are  motivated  by  religious  fanaticism  or  had\nsecular  goals  and  beliefs,  they  become  susceptible  to  the  idea   of\nsacrificing their own life for carrying out the will of God, or Allah or  in\nwaging a ‘holy war’.  It  is  important  to  note  here  that  terrorism  is\nabhorred and condemned by  all  the  religions  of  the  world.   Terrorists\nconduct planned and coordinated attacks targeting innocent civilians with  a\nview to infuse terror in the minds  of  people.   India,  particularly,  has\nbeen a victim on several occasions.

It may be possible to describe it as use of violence when\n      its most important result is not merely the physical and mental damage\n      of the victim but the prolonged psychological effect  it  produces  or\n      has the potential of producing on the society as a whole. There may be\n      death, injury, or destruction  of  property  or  even  deprivation  of\n      individual liberty in the process but the  extent  and  reach  of  the\n      intended terrorist activity travels beyond the effect of  an  ordinary\n      crime capable of being punished under the ordinary penal  law  of  the\n      land and its main objective is to overawe the  Government  or  disturb\n      harmony of the society or “terrorise” people and the society  and  not\n      only those directly assaulted, with a  view  to  disturb  even  tempo,\n      peace and tranquillity of the society and create a sense of  fear  and\n      insecurity.

As noted at the outset, it is not possible to  precisely  define\n      “terrorism”. Finding a definition of “terrorism” has haunted countries\n      for  decades.  A  first  attempt  to  arrive  at  an   internationally\n      acceptable definition was made under the League of  Nations,  but  the\n      convention drafted in 1937 never came into existence.  The  UN  Member\n      States still have no  agreed-upon  definition.  Terminology  consensus\n      would, however, be necessary for a single comprehensive convention  on\n      terrorism, which some countries favour in place of the present  twelve\n      piecemeal conventions and  protocols.  The  lack  of  agreement  on  a\n      definition of terrorism  has  been  a  major  obstacle  to  meaningful\n      international countermeasures. Cynics have often  commented  that  one\n      State&#x27;s “terrorist” is another State&#x27;s “freedom fighter”. If terrorism\n      is defined strictly in terms of attacks  on  non-military  targets,  a\n      number of attacks on military installations and  soldiers&#x27;  residences\n      could not be included in the statistics. In order to cut  through  the\n      Gordian definitional knot, terrorism expert  A.  Schmid  suggested  in\n      1992 in a report for the then UN Crime Branch that it might be a  good\n      idea to take the existing consensus on what constitutes a “war  crime”\n      as a point of departure. If  the  core  of  war  crimes  —  deliberate\n      attacks on civilians, hostage-taking and the killing of prisoners — is\n      extended to peacetime, we could simply define  acts  of  terrorism  as\n      “peacetime equivalents of war crimes”.

Attack on the institution of democracy, which is the very basis  of\n      our country (by attacking Parliament, Legislative Assembly etc.).

Attack on civilians to generate terror and fear psychosis among the\n      general  populace.  The  attack  at  worshipping  places   to   injure\n      sentiments and to  whip  communal  passions.  These  are  designed  to\n      position the people against the Government by creating  a  feeling  of\n      insecurity.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1524\">      9. Terrorist acts are meant to destabilise the nation  by  challenging\n      its sovereignty and integrity, to raze the  constitutional  principles\n      that we hold dear, to create a psyche  of  fear  and  anarchism  among\n      common  people,  to  tear  apart  the  secular  fabric,  to  overthrow\n      democratically elected government, to promote prejudice  and  bigotry,\n      to demoralise the security forces, to thwart the economic progress and\n      development and so on. This cannot be equated with  a  usual  law  and\n      order problem within a State. On the other hand,  it  is  inter-State,\n      international or cross-border in character. Fight  against  the  overt\n      and covert acts  of  terrorism  is  not  a  regular  criminal  justice\n      endeavour. Rather, it is defence of our nation and its citizens. It is\n      a challenge to the whole nation and invisible force of Indianness that\n      binds this great  nation  together.  Therefore,  terrorism  is  a  new\n      challenge for law enforcement. By indulging  in  terrorist  activities\n      organised groups or individuals, trained, inspired  and  supported  by\n      fundamentalists and anti-Indian elements are trying to destabilise the\n      country. This new breed of menace was hitherto unheard  of.  Terrorism\n      is  definitely  a  criminal  act,  but  it  is  much  more  than  mere\n      criminality.  Today  the  Government  is  charged  with  the  duty  of\n      protecting the unity, integrity, secularism and sovereignty  of  India\n      from terrorists, both from outside and within  the  borders.  To  face\n      terrorism we need new approaches, techniques, weapons,  expertise  and\n      of course new laws. In the  abovesaid  circumstances  Parliament  felt\n      that a new anti-terrorism law is necessary for a better  future.  This\n      parliamentary resolve is epitomised in POTA.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1167\">451)  Terrorism is a major problem that is reoccurring  over  the  globe  in\nmany different forms.  In short, terrorism is  a  plague  for  a  nation  or\nsociety that should be eradicated. There is a dire need to  best  deal  with\nit and to make sure to take preventive actions  so  that  other  groups  and\npeople are not motivated to make themselves heard through  various  acts  of\nterrorism.  In our considered  view,  the  following  procedures/rules  must\nhave to be adopted while dealing with it:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1525\">     i) Better governance and law enforcement is the real need of the hour.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1526\">    ii) We must formulate long term as well as  short  term  strategies  to\n        combat terrorism.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1527\">   iii) More advanced technologies must be used for communication among law\n        enforcement agencies.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1528\">    iv) Fighting terrorism would require a long term planning and sustained\n        multi-dimensional action.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1529\">     v) There should be proper coordination between all the  agencies  with\n        high level of motivation  and  a  quick  response  system  must  be\n        established to tackle the menace immediately.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1530\">    vi) Rule of Law must always be  upheld  and  it  is  the  duty  of  the\n        constitutional authority  to  defend  the  life  and  limb  of  its\n        subjects.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1168\">India being a secular State, such religious  fanaticism  which  resulted  in\nsuch terrorist acts  should  not  be  allowed  to  destroy  the  very  basic\nstructure of our Constitution.

This  duty  to  prevent\nacts of terrorism stems from  the  basic  principle  of  sovereignty,  which\nentails both rights  and  obligations.  Under  the  ‘Universal  Neighbouring\nPrinciples’, it is well established that the rights of one state  end  where\nthe territory of another state begins. An obvious source of this  obligation\nlies in <a href=\"/doc/32154/\" id=\"a_976\">Article 2(4)</a> of the UN Charter, which embodies the customary law  of\n“prohibiting states from using or threatening to use force  against  another\nstate”.

Thus,  the\npolice have a specific and special role, a duty  and  a  responsibility,  to\ncurb the conveyance of explosives by  vigilant  patrolling  and  search  and\nseizure, if required. <a href=\"/doc/1148859/\" id=\"a_978\">Section 20</a> of the Arms  Act,  1959  empowers  them  to\narrest  persons  conveying  any  arms  or   ammunitions   under   suspicious\ncircumstances.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1181\">460)  Unfortunately, in the present  case  the  police  officers  themselves\nhave  taken  active  part  in  smuggling  and  transportation  of  arms  and\nexplosives in Bombay.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1182\">461)  The twin duties of police are prevention of crime and  maintenance  of\nlaw and order.

Hence, they have sensitive responsibility to defend the  safety\nand security of the people at all times. Law  empowers  them  with  numerous\npowers to prevent and  control  crimes  like  terrorism  affecting  internal\nsecurity.

They  are  entrusted  with  powers  of  search  and\nseizure and conduct of on-spot  investigations.  But  when  the  officer  of\ncustoms enters into or acquiesces in any agreement to abstain from doing  or\npermits, conceals or connives at any act whereby any  fraudulent  import  is\naffected, it can have a disastrous effect on country’s security.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1548\">465)  It is shattering to  notice  that  all  grades  of  customs  officers,\nincluding the Commissioners of Customs played an active role as  members  of\nconspiracy and implemented the plan.  Every kind of  smuggling  activity  is\ndevastating to  the  economy,  but  the  smuggling  of  dangerous  arms  and\nammunitions causes wreckage not only to the economy  but  also  to  people’s\nlives.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1549\">466)  The occurrence of Bombay Bomb Blasts brings us  to  the  reality  that\nsuch incidents take place along the Indian  coastline  irrespective  of  the\nnumerous laws and safeguards provided due to the lack of  moral  ethics  and\nmisconduct on the part of the officials.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1550\">467)  Custom being a significant source of government revenue, the  officers\nof Customs Department must perform  their  respective  duties  honestly  and\ndiligently.  Any  act  or  omission  on  their  part  can  have  devastating\nconsequences.  The role played by the Customs Officers in pursuance  of  the\nconspiracy can be summarized as under:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1551\">(1)   A-82, A-90, A-102, A-112 and A-113, who were the Customs  Officers  at\n      the relevant time in Bombay and Alibaug, have played an active role as\n      members of the conspiracy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1552\">(2)   A-112 attended a meeting with Mohd.

Dossa\n      (AA), A-134 and A-136, where the Customs Officers agreed to charge Rs.\n      7 to 8 lacs from Mohd.

[Firoz  Abdul\n      Rashid Khan was absconding and has since been arrested on 06.02.2010]\n(6)   A-82 played an important role in  negotiations  with  Police  Officers\n      and A-116 and  seven  Constables  when  they  intercepted  the  convoy\n      carrying smuggled contraband on 09.01.1993. A-82 even  permitted  A-30\n      to drive a customs jeep when they went for negotiations.\n(7)   Collector Customs  (PW-470),  on  receipt  of  information  from  DRI,\n      through a DO letter dated 25.01.1993,  conveyed  to  all  the  Customs\n      Officers (accused) and others  that  the  ISI  Syndicates  located  in\n      Middle East may try to smuggle contrabands and arms along with  silver\n      bricks in the districts of Bombay, Raigarh and  Thane  and  instructed\n      them to be more vigilant.

He  conveyed  this\n     information to A-112 for taking suitable action.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1194\">(9)    A-112 deliberately  kept  a  ‘nakabandi’  at  the  wrong  place  i.e.\n     Puranphata and Dehanphata  leaving  one  route  open  for  the  accused\n     persons to carry the smuggled arms and explosives without any check.\n(10)  When the subordinate Customs Officers suggested  to  keep  ‘nakabandi’\n     at proper place i.e. junction of Sai Mobra-Mangaon Road and   Mahasala-\n     Goregaon Road, A-112 informed them that  he  had  specific  information\n     that Tiger Memon would bring the contraband goods from that route only.\n     PW-172 had not told A-112 that landing  would  be  organized  by  Tiger\n     Memon.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1195\">(11)  Landing of arms and explosives did take place on the night of 2nd  and\n      3rd Feb. 1993.

Collector  of\n      Customs) received information about it  and  conveyed  the  same  over\n      phone to A-112.  On getting information  from  PW-171,  A-112  sent  a\n      misleading wireless message to Marine &amp; Preventive, Srivardhan to keep\n      a vigil at Bankot, which is miles away from the place of landing.\n(13)  When landing of arms and explosives was in  progress  at  Shekhadi  on\n      the night of 02.02.1993, A-90 and A-82 reached the  place  of  landing\n      and met A-14 and Tiger Memon. They enquired from Tiger  Memon  whether\n      the landing was for weapons. Tiger Memon replied in negative.\n(14)  Another landing took place on the night of 7th and 8th  Feb.  1993.  A\n      large quantity of  arms  and  explosives  were  smuggled  during  this\n      landing also. Tiger Memon  and  other  accused  participated  in  this\n      landing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1197\">(15)  A-14, A-17 and A-30 have also spoken  about  the  payment  of  illegal\n      gratifications to Customs Officers for the landings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1198\">468)  From the above, it will not be an overstatement to state that  if  not\nfor the help of the customs officials, they would not be in  a  position  to\nsmuggle the weapons required for the said blasts.  A  rationally  structured\nand effective customs department is  the  need  of  the  hour  in  order  to\ncurtail illegal imports which can have frightening  ramifications  upon  the\nnation’s economy and citizens’ security. Corruption  among  public  servants\nindicates a failure of our system where pursuit  of  personal  gratification\nsubdues public interest.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1199\">Lack of vigilance in the Indian Maritime Zone and Indifference on  the  part\nof Coast Guards:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1555\">469)  India being a maritime nation, the role of coast guards is very  vital\nfor shielding the coast from external attacks. The coastal belt is  surveyed\nby three teams of officers firstly, the Indian Navy who is  responsible  for\noverall seaward security of long coastline. Secondly, the coast  guards  who\nguard the Exclusive Economic  Zone  (EEZ)  in  order  to  prevent  poaching,\nsmuggling and other illegal activities  in  the  EEZ.  Lastly,  the  customs\nofficials, who scrutinize and  monitor  every  commodity  which  enters  the\nIndian boundaries.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1556\">470)  This triple-layered security system is created primarily to guard  the\nIndian Coastline from maritime terrorism, piracy and  to  keep  out  foreign\nintruders. Hence, it is the paramount duty of  all  these  officials  to  be\nvigilant, heedful and attentive to each activity which  occurs  in  the  sea\nand on the shore. However, the occurrence of  Bombay  Bomb  Blasts  on  12th\nMarch 1993 discloses the deficient performance of the officials.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1557\">471)  Similarly,  the Indian  Coast  Guard (ICG)  was  set  up  in  1978  as\na paramilitary branch of the Indian Armed Forces primarily for  surveillance\nof the India’s Exclusive Economic Zone to prevent  poaching,  smuggling  and\nother illegal activities in the zone.  The Coast Guards being the  strongest\nlink in the security chain are bound to be vigilant at sea and should be  in\nfull command of the coast.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1558\">472)  For the same, they are empowered to search and seize  ships  suspected\nof illegal activities. Besides, <a href=\"/doc/42854/\" id=\"a_979\">Section 14</a> of  the  Coast  Guard  Act,  1978\ngives the ample scope for coast guards  to  assist  the  customs  and  other\nauthorities in anti-smuggling operations necessary  for  protection  of  our\nlong coastline.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1559\">473)  As the perception of war is changing we should not overlook  the  role\nand the significance of the  coast  guards  and  the  customs  officials  in\ncombating terrorism. The role of the coast guards is  as  important  as  any\nmilitary troops. Only well strategized coast guards and high morale  customs\nofficers can prevent any opportunity for the terrorists  to  attack  on  our\ncountry via our maritime boundary.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1200\"> Quantum of Sentence:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1560\">474)   After  meticulous  examination  of  confessional  statements  of  the\naccused and the co-accused, the recoveries  made,  and  other  evidences  it\nestablishes undoubtedly the guilt of all the death convicts.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1561\">475)  Before we deliberate and decide upon the role played by  each  of  the\nappellants  and  their  respective  sentence,  certain  reference   to   the\ncontextual developments over the epochs with regard to death sentence  would\nbe timely, which will assist us in determining the sentence in this case.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1201\">Evolvement of Law Relating to Death Sentence:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1562\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1235094\" id=\"span_161\">476)  The constitutional validity of the death  sentence  has  been  brought\nunder scrutiny from time to time  to  test  the  rationality  of  the  death\nsentence  with  the  emerging  civilization.  Though  death  penalty  as   a\npunishment is  not  abolished  as  yet,  significant  amendments  have  been\nbrought in for limiting the usage of the punishment.  It  is  manifest  from\nthe bare reading of judgments on death penalty from 1950 to till  date  that\nthe judiciary has always exercised its discretion in awarding  this  extreme\npenalty with great circumspection, caution  and  restraint.  The  nature  of\nthis discretion bestowed on judges has been considered and reflected in  the\nmost celebrated <a href=\"/doc/1235094/\" id=\"a_980\">Bachan Singh</a> case (supra) in the following terms:-</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1563\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1235094\" id=\"span_162\">“165….Cognizant of the past experience of the administration of  death\n      penalty in India, Parliament, in its wisdom thought it best  and  safe\n      to leave the imposition of this gravest punishment in gravest cases of\n      murder, to the judicial discretion of the courts which are  manned  by\n      persons of reason, experience and  standing  in  the  profession.  The\n      exercise  of  this  sentencing  discretion  cannot  be  said   to   be\n      untrammelled and unguided. It is exercised  judicially  in  accordance\n      with well-recognized principles crystallized  by  judicial  decisions,\n      directed along the broad contours of legislative  policy  towards  the\n      signposts enacted in Section 354(3).”\n\n\nThe dictum in <a href=\"/doc/1235094/\" id=\"a_981\">Bachan Singh</a> case paraphrases that the duty  casted  upon  the\njudges in deciding the appropriate sentence is  a  matter  of  judiciousness\nand not of law.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1564\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"590378\" id=\"span_163\">477)  Earlier, <a href=\"/doc/187398444/\" id=\"a_982\">Section 3(2)</a> of  the  TADA  Act,  1985  stipulated  mandatory\ndeath sentence for a terrorist act, which results in  death.  The  challenge\nto this provision was mounted on the ratio  of  Supreme  Court  decision  in\n<a href=\"/doc/590378/\" id=\"a_983\">Mithu vs. State of Punjab</a>, (1983) 2 SCC 277 in which their Lordships  struck\ndown <a href=\"/doc/793437/\" id=\"a_984\">Section  303</a>  of  the  IPC  as  unconstitutional,  which  provided  for\ncompulsory imposition of death sentence.  As  a  result,  the  corresponding\nprovision of <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_985\">TADA Act</a> had also provided  for  the  alternative  sentence  of\nlife imprisonment thus bringing the provision in line with the provision  of\n302  of  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_986\">IPC</a>.  <a href=\"/doc/186975316/\" id=\"a_987\">Section  3(2)(i)</a>  of  TADA  now  prescribes  death  or   life\nimprisonment in alternative as the  penalty  for  a  terrorist  act.

For  clarification,  though  <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_989\">TADA  Act,\n1987</a> is a special act the application of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_990\">Code of Criminal  Procedure</a>  is\npermissible to the extent of its consistency with the act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1203\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1837051\" id=\"span_164\">479)  The very first case  where  the  constitutional  validity  of  capital\npunishment was vehemently discussed and decided was in  <a href=\"/doc/1837051/\" id=\"a_991\">Jagmohan  Singh  vs.\nState of U.P</a>  (1973) 1 SCC 20. This  case  was  decided  when  the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_992\">Code  of\nCriminal Procedure</a>, 1898 (for short the old  Code)  was  in  force.  Section\n367(5) of the old Code provided that if an accused person  is  convicted  of\nan offence punishable with death, but he is sentenced to a punishment  other\nthan death, the Court was required to state the reason  why  a  sentence  of\ndeath was not passed.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_1204\">Section 367(5) of the old Code reads as follows:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1565\">      “If the accused is convicted of an offence punishable with death,  and\n      the court sentences him to any punishment other than death, the  court\n      shall in its judgment state the reason why sentence of death  was  not\n      passed.”\n\n\n      Therefore, all  the  death  penalty  cases  until  1973  were  decided\naccording to the principle  that  death  sentence  was  the  rule  and  life\nimprisonment was the exception. However, after  the  new  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_993\">Code  of  Criminal\nProcedure</a>, 1973 which came into force with effect from 1st April, 1974,  the\nprinciple took a converse turn and it was stated that imprisonment for  life\nwould be the rule and a sentence of death was an exception.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1566\">Amended section 354(3) of the Code reads as follows:-\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1567\">      “When the conviction is for an offence punishable with  death  or,  in\n      the alternative, with imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term\n      of years, the judgment  shall  state  the  reasons  for  the  sentence\n      awarded, and, in the case of sentence of death,  the  special  reasons\n      for such sentence.”\n\n\n      The Code effectively reversed the position as  it  existed  under  the\nold Code and also placed a rider that if a sentence  of  death  is  awarded,\nthe court should record  special  reasons  for  awarding  the  same.  As  an\noutcome, the discretion to impose the sentence of death has been  curbed  to\nthe extent of stating the ‘Special  reasons’.  Presently,  judges  are  left\nwith the task of discovering the &#x27;Special reasons&#x27;.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1568\">480)  What are these ‘Special Reasons’ and does the provisions of  the  Code\nhelp us in discovery of these special reasons?

Like the rest of us they too are  the\n      creatures of circumstance. Heredity, environment, home  neighbourhood,\n      upbringing, school, friends, associates,  even  casual  acquaintances,\n      the books that one reads, newspapers, radio and TV, the  economics  of\n      the household, the opportunities provided  by  circumstances  and  the\n      calamities resulting therefrom,  the  success  and  failure  of  one&#x27;s\n      undertakings, the affairs of the heart,  ambitions  and  frustrations,\n      the ideas and ideologies of the time, these and several other ordinary\n      and  extra-ordinary  incidents  of  life  contribute  to  a   person&#x27;s\n      personality  and  influence  his  conduct.

Well, may one  exclaim  with  Prof.  Vrij  &quot;What  audacity  is\n      involved in these three tasks : to interpret  life,  explain  an  act,\n      predict the latest inclination of a human mind.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1571\">      &#x27;Special reasons&#x27;, we  may,  therefore  say,  are  reasons  which  are\n      special  with  reference  to   the   offender,   with   reference   to\n      constitutional and legislative directives and with  reference  to  the\n      times, that is, with reference to contemporary ideas in the fields  of\n      Criminology and connected sciences.

The second question regarding the unguided  and  untrammelled\ndiscretion vested upon the judges to impose death sentence  or  imprisonment\nfor life was answered in the following words:-</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1585\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1837051\" id=\"span_171\">“161.

It reads as follows:</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1587\">      “201. With great respect, we find ourselves unable to  agree  to  this\n      enunciation. As we read Sections 354(3) and 235(2) and  other  related\n      provisions of the Code of 1973, it is  quite  clear  to  us  that  for\n      making the choice of punishment or for ascertaining the  existence  or\n      absence of &quot;special reasons&quot; in that context, the Court must  pay  due\n      regard both to the crime and the criminal. What is the relative weight\n      to be given to the aggravating and mitigating factors, depends on  the\n      facts and circumstances of the particular case. More often  than  not,\n      these two aspects are so intertwined that it is difficult  to  give  a\n      separate treatment to each of them. This is so because &#x27;style  is  the\n      &#x27;man&#x27;. In many cases, the extremely cruel or  beastly  manner  of  the\n      commission of murder is itself a demonstrated index  of  the  depraved\n      character of the perpetrator. That is why,  it  is  not  desirable  to\n      consider the circumstances of the crime and the circumstances  of  the\n      criminal in two separate water-tight compartments. In a sense, to kill\n      is to be cruel and therefore all murders are cruel. But  such  cruelty\n      may vary in its degree  of  culpability.  And  it  is  only  when  the\n      culpability assumes the proportion of extreme depravity that  &quot;special\n      reasons&quot; can legitimately be said to exist.”\n\n\n      “163…..The present legislative policy discernible from Section  235(2)\n      read with Section 354(3) is that in fixing the degree of punishment or\n      making the choice of sentence  for  various  offences,  including  one\n      under Section 302, Penal  Code,  the  Court  should  not  confine  its\n      consideration &quot;principally&quot; or merely to the  circumstances  connected\n      with  particular  crime,  but  also  give  due  consideration  to  the\n      circumstances of the criminal.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1588\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1235094\" id=\"span_174\">490)  As a consequence, the majority view in <a href=\"/doc/1235094/\" id=\"a_1007\">Bachan Singh</a>  (supra),  gave  a\nwider interpretation to the term “special reasons” by embracing  within  its\nambit both the circumstances connected with the  particular  crime  and  the\ncriminal. Upshot of  this  interpretation  is  that  the  ‘special  reasons’\nrequired for confirming the death sentence  under  Section  302  or  in  the\ncontext of this case in <a href=\"/doc/186975316/\" id=\"a_1008\">Section 3(2)(i)</a> of TADA will have to  be  identified\nby balancing the aggravating and mitigating or extenuating circumstances.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1589\">491)  While determining the aggravating circumstances relative weight  ought\nto be given to both criminal and the crime and an  identical  approach  must\nbe adhered to for ascertaining the  mitigating  circumstances.  Since  these\ntwo aspects are interwoven, it is difficult to segregate the  two  to  state\nthat all circumstances relating to crime will be aggravating,  likewise  all\ncircumstances  relating  to  criminal  are  mitigating.   From   the   above\nconspectus, it is clear that the  aggravating  circumstances  pertaining  to\nboth crime and criminal are the reasons, which can be against  the  accused;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1208\">likewise  the  mitigating  circumstances  marshaled  from  both  crime   and\ncriminal can be the reasons in favour of the accused.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1209\">492)  For instance, the manner of commission of murder may not be brutal  or\ndiabolic  or  pre-meditated.  This  can  be  construed   as   a   mitigating\ncircumstance pertaining to crime and not  the  criminal.  Hence,  a  careful\nevaluation of aggravating and mitigating circumstances  pertaining  to  both\ncriminal and crime is the approach to  ascertain  the  special  reasons  for\nimposing the extreme penalty on a person.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1210\">493)  Thus, the two cardinal factors, viz., one, the  penalty  imposed  must\nbe proportionate to the gravity of the  crime  and  second,  the  degree  of\nresponsibility of the offender must be taken  into  account  in  determining\nthe sentence for an  individual  accused  in  addition  to  aggravating  and\nmitigating circumstances.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1211\"> 494)     Now,   straightaway  we  shall  determine  the  sentence  for  the\nappellants within the boundaries prescribed by  law,  bearing  in  mind  the\npurpose of punishment and taking into account all circumstances  influencing\nthe degree of severity (mitigating and aggravating  circumstances)  and,  in\nparticular the degree of criminal responsibility.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1212\">495)  For convenience, we shall discuss Yakub  Abdul  Razak  Memon’s  appeal\ndiscretely as against the other 10 appellants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1213\">Criminal Appeal No. 1728 of 2007\nYakub Abdul Razak Memon (A-1)\n\n\n      Before we shall enumerate the aggravating and mitigating circumstances\nfor  consideration  on  sentencing,  we  ought  to  find   the   degree   of\nresponsibility of A-1 for the occurrence of blasts on 12th  March,  1993  in\ncomparison with other appellants. Our legal  system  has  always  emphasized\nthat the sentence shall reflect the relative significance of  the  accused’s\nrole.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1214\">496)    A-1 is the younger brother of Tiger Memon, (AA), who is one  of  the\nmasterminds  behind  the  blasts.  A-1  was  in  a  position  of  authority,\nparticularly, had played a significant role in the  context  of  the  blasts\nwhich  is  important  while  determining  the  sentence.  The   confessional\nstatements of co-accused discussed in earlier part of judgment  under  A-1’s\nappeal establish the dominating position  of  the  appellant  in  comparison\nwith other 10 appellants.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1215\">497)  At the cost of repetition, we may reiterate the conduct of A-1,  which\nmay be very relevant for ascertaining his dominant  position  in  commission\nof the crime.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1216\">498)  The following conduct of  the  appellant  (A-1)  along  with  the  co-\nconspirator family members may be relevant:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1590\">        a) The confessional statements of various co-accused make a mention\n           that Tiger Memon has instructed them to stay in touch  with  A-1\n           for further instruction. Meaning thereby, A-1 assumed  the  role\n           of Tiger Memon in India during his absence. As an outcome, Tiger\n           Memon gave the commands to A-1, who in turn had passed  them  to\n           other accused thereby signifying the trusted position  that  A-1\n           has obtained from Tiger Memon, apart from being just  a  younger\n           brother.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1591\">        b) Moreover, A-1’s role was limited  not  only  to  the  extent  of\n           correspondence between the masterminds and all other accused but\n           he was also entrusted with task of handling the  explosive  bags\n           and for their safe keeping,  which  is  again  revealed  in  the\n           confessional statements of various co-accused persons.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1592\">        c) Furthermore, he was actively involved in hawala transactions for\n           the purpose of facilitating the blasts on 12th March 1993.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1593\">        d) Besides, he acquired tickets both for  Dubai  and  Pakistan  for\n           transporting the appellants to the  respective  places  for  the\n           purpose of  training  and  coaching  them  in  envisaging  their\n           participation for the blasts in Bombay.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1594\"> 499) Essentially, A-1’s deeds can’t be viewed distinct  from  the  act  of\n Tiger Memon, hence, both owe an equivalent responsibility for the  blasts.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1217\"> They were the architects of the blasts, without whom the plan  would  have\n never seen the daylight. From this conduct, it is not hyperbole  to  state\n that, he was one of the ‘driving  sprit’  behind  the  plan  of  the  1993\n blasts, whereas the other appellants played a far lesser role and  thus  a\n lesser contribution to the crimes resulting from this plan. To be  clearer\n on the dominant position, the blasts  on  12th  March,  1993  was  at  the\n discretion of the masterminds, meaning thereby,  they  had  the  effective\n control over the incident. It is this effective control over the incident,\n which is absent in the role played by rest of the appellants.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1218\">500)  Hence, there is a significant difference in the  role  played  by  A-1\nand the rest of the appellants. It is difficult to rule out  with  certainty\nthat if the absconding accused were to be brought to trial, they might  have\nthrown further light at the role-played by A-1. Since A-1 as well  as  other\nabsconders were the real conspirators who hatched  the  scheme  for  such  a\ntragic act, the other 10 appellants i.e  A-32, A-36, A-39,  A-44,  A-10,  A-\n29, A-9, A-11, A-12  and  A-16  were  mere  subservient  subordinates  whose\nknowledge  and  acquaintance   might   have   been   restricted   to   their\ncounterparts. If  we  say  it  in  a  metaphoric  style,  A-1  and  all  the\nabsconding accused were the archers whereas rest of the appellants were  the\narrows in their hands.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1219\">501)   We are mindful of the fact that there is no direct act attributed  to\nA-1 as far  as  parking  of  the  explosives  filled  vehicle  in  different\nlocalities are concerned. But we should recollect,  that  if,  not  for  the\nplanning of conspirators for which A-1 was a party too, the  explosives  and\nammunition required  for  the  execution  wouldn’t  have  entered  into  our\ncountry  and  as  a  consequence  the   execution   itself   wouldn’t   have\nmaterialized. Furthermore, it is not  conceivable  to  envisage  that  these\nprincipal perpetrators will take the  execution  in  their  hands.  So  they\ntargeted the meek souls who were underprivileged and easily  impressible  to\naccomplish their ulterior motive. It is also a proved fact that the  Memon’s\nfamily members including A-1 have fled the  country  anticipating  detention\nfor their illegal acts.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1220\">502)   From this, it can safely be concluded  that  no  offence  might  have\ntaken place at all but for the instigation by the absconding accused and  A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1221\">1. Hence the dominant position of the accused is an  aggravating  factor  by\nitself, as it gives the status of direct responsibility.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1222\">503)  The following aggravating circumstances as against A-1 can  be  culled\nout:-\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1595\">Aggravating Circumstances:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1596\">   1. A-1 was one of the brains behind the hatching of larger conspiracy for\n      the Bombay Bomb Blasts in 1993.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1597\">   2. The dominant position and significant role played by A-1 is  a  factor\n      that may aggravate his punishment.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1598\">   3. The “vulnerability of the victims” and “the depravity of  the  crimes”\n      constitute additional aggravating circumstances.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1599\">   4. Crime of terrorism is in itself  an  aggravating  circumstance  as  it\n      carries a “special stigmatization”  due  to  the  deliberate  form  of\n      inhuman treatment it represents and  the  severity  of  the  pain  and\n      suffering inflicted.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1600\">   5. He was part of the deliberate  choosing  of  localities  like  Century\n      Bazaar, Zaveri Bazaar, Katha  Bazaar,  Stock  Exchange  Building  etc.\n      where there was more prospect of public gathering. The manner  of  its\n      execution and its design would put it at the level of extreme atrocity\n      and cruelty.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1223\">Mitigating Circumstances:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1601\">504)  Mr. Jaspal Singh, learned senior counsel submitted  the  following  as\nthe mitigating circumstances to reduce the severity of the sentence of  A-1.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1224\">    • He is a Chartered Accountant by profession and a  respectable  person\n      in the society before the occurrence of this incident.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1225\">    • Learned senior counsel emphasized more on the point that  this  is  a\n      fabricated case and A-1 was merely inflicted in  this  trial  on  the\n      sole ground  of  being  the  brother  of  Tiger  Memon,  who  is  the\n      absconding accused in this case. As a consequence, there is no  overt\n      act committed by the  accused  himself.  In  fact,  the  act  of  A-1\n      returning to India unlike other absconders is in itself a  mitigating\n      circumstance in his favour.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1226\">    • No criminal antecedent.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1227\">    • He suffers from depression since 1996.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1228\">    •  Lastly, he had served more than 19 years in jail.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1229\">505)  In our considered opinion, the  argument  of  learned  senior  counsel\nthat A-1 was inflicted in this trial only on the sole ground  of  being  the\nbrother of Tiger Memon does not  impress  us,  as  the  evidence  shows  the\ncontrary. We accept the contention of learned senior counsel and  treat  the\nlack of prior criminal record as  a  mitigating  factor;  other  ascertained\nmitigating circumstances are not at  the  higher  pedestal  to  bargain  for\nreduction of sentence.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1230\">506)  Now, the task is vested upon us to determine appropriate sentence  for\nan accused who was in the commanding position and was involved in crimes  of\nthe utmost gravity. Under the established jurisprudence, these two  factors-\na commanding position and a crime of ‘utmost gravity’ ordinarily  merit  the\nextreme penalty even accounting for the guilty plea and mitigating  factors.\nThis is the special reason, which warrants death penalty to the accused.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1231\">507)  For the foregoing reasons, having taking into account and weighed  the\ntotality of A-1’s culpability and all the particular  circumstances  of  the\ncase, we concur with the decision of the Designated Court  and  confirm  the\nsentence of capital  punishment  to  A-1  and  the  appeal  is  disposed  of\naccordingly.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1232\">508)  We shall now discuss the appeals  filed  by  rest  of  the  appellants\nsentenced to capital punishment by the Designated Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1233\">509)  The above said appellants have traded the freedom of  choice  for  the\nfreedom to commit atrocities. The discussion relating to Yakub  Abdul  Razak\nMemon (A-1) amply differentiates the role  played  by  these  10  appellants\nwith A-1. Though the incident of bomb blasts is not a  brainchild  of  these\n10 appellants yet they  turned  the  conspirators’  orders  into  action  by\nexecuting the  blasts  for  which  they  are  indisputably  liable  for  the\nconsequence of their acts. Every  person  is  responsible  for  his  or  her\nactions  and  they  can’t  evade   the   accountability   by   placing   the\nresponsibility to another  person.  At  the  same  time,  our  legal  system\nmandates that the sentence shall reflect the relative  significance  of  the\naccused’s role.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1234\">510)  The following are the aggravating circumstances  with  regard  to  the\nabove said appellants:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1602\">Aggravating circumstances\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1603\">   1.

Crime of terrorism is in itself  an  aggravating  circumstance  as  it\n      carries a “special stigmatization”  due  to  the  deliberate  form  of\n      inhuman treatment it represents and  the  severity  of  the  pain  and\n      suffering inflicted.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1606\">   4. The “vulnerability of the victims” and “the depravity of  the  crimes”\n      constitute additional aggravating circumstances.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1607\">   5. The manner of its execution and its design is at a  level  of  extreme\n      atrocity and cruelty.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1235\">      Though the aggravating circumstances remains the same for all  the  10\nappellants, but their mitigating  circumstance  differ  from  individual  to\nindividual.  Therefore,  we  shall  catalog  the  mitigating   circumstances\nindependently for each accused.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1236\">511)   The  following  factors  may  be  relevant  while  ascertaining   the\nmitigating circumstances:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1608\">Criminal Appeal Nos. 609-610 of 2008\n\n\n      Learned counsel for  the  appellants  submitted  that  all  the  three\nappellants (A-32, A-36 and A-39) have been in  custody  since  their  arrest\nexcept A-39, who was granted interim bail on medical grounds to  look  after\nhis mother who was seriously ill.  As on date, the  appellants  have  served\nmore than 19 years each in jail. According to learned  counsel,  during  the\nabove said entire period, there  is  no  complaint  against  the  appellants\neither by the jail authorities or by the escort party as and when they  were\ngranted permission to go for  medical  treatment  and  to  their  respective\nhomes in order to attend marriage, sickness, other functions  and  death  of\ntheir near and dear  ones.   Learned  counsel  further  submitted  that  the\nappellants being the first time offenders  have  already  incarcerated  more\nthan 19 years in custody and they must be considered and be given  a  chance\nof reformation to be in society.  It was further pointed out that  A-32  has\ncompleted his Graduation (Bachelor  of  Commerce)  from  Yeshwantrao  Chavan\nMaharashtra Open University, Nashik while in  jail  which  itself  indicates\nthe prospect of his reformation and  rehabilitation.

The first five aspects have been accepted as  mitigating\ncircumstances by the established practices of this Court.  As  far  as  ‘ill\nhealth’ is concerned, it is not a  mitigating  but  a  special  circumstance\nwhich may aid in reduction of sentence. The vital  distinction  between  the\n‘special circumstance’ and ‘mitigating circumstance appears to  lie  in  the\nfact that the reduction in penalty is given not owing to  any  merit  earned\non  the  part  of  the  accused,  but  because  of  compelling  ‘reasons  of\nhumanity’, illustrating a humane approach to sentencing in this context.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1253\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"751831\" id=\"span_175\">513)  Another vital factor stated as mitigating circumstance  in  all  these\npetitions is that they have all been imprisoned  for  around  20  years  and\nthey continue to be in jail; hence the defence  counsel  submitted  that  on\nhumanitarian grounds, sentence of all the death convicts must be reduced  to\nimprisonment for life. Nevertheless, it is settled  law  by  a  Constitution\nBench in <a href=\"/doc/751831/\" id=\"a_1009\">Triveniben vs. State of Gujarat</a> (1989)  1  SCC  678  that  sentence\ncan’t be commuted merely on the  ground  of  delay  alone.  It  was  further\nobserved that no absolute or unqualified rule  can  be  laid  down  that  in\nevery case in which there  is  a  long  delay  in  the  execution  of  death\nsentence,  the  sentence  must  be  substituted  by  the  sentence  of  life\nimprisonment. Thus no accused can claim as a  matter  of  right  to  commute\nhis/her death sentence on the ground  of  delay  in  the  judicial  process.\nHowever, noting the lengthy incarceration suffered by  the  accused  over  a\nperiod of two decades, as  an  exceptional  scenario,  we  are  inclined  to\nconsider the long delay as a mitigating circumstance but  less  significance\nwill be attached to them in comparison with other six circumstances.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1254\">514)  Furthermore, as we have  already  narrated,  all  the  above  said  10\nappellants belong to the lower strata of society, most of  whom  don’t  even\nhave any regular job for their livelihood. In  brief,  their  personal  life\nwas  relatively  moderate  before   this   incident.   Subsequently,   these\nappellants have fallen prey to the ulterior motive of the  conspirators  for\naccomplishing their hidden motives, which was to  spread  terror  among  the\npeople. Such evidence can in no way  exonerate  or  excuse  them  for  their\nparticipation in the commission of crime. However, it  provides  a  somewhat\nnuanced picture and may imply that  their  participation  in  the  massacres\nresulted from misguided notions rather than extremism.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1255\">515)  Recalling that the sentence should directly reflect the  role  of  the\naccused in the crime, we made an attempt to  evaluate  the  significance  of\nthese mitigating circumstances respectively and their repercussions  on  the\nquantum of sentence on these 10 appellants.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1256\">516)  Technically, it is  these  10  appellants  who  parked  the  explosive\nfilled vehicles in the respective destinations, however, if we do  lift  the\nveil it is actually the masterminds strategy,  which  was  executed  by  the\nsubservient minions i.e these 10 appellants. This may not help  in  complete\nexoneration of the liability of  these  10  appellants  but  the  degree  of\npunishment  must  necessarily  reflect  this  difference.  It  is  vital  to\nremember that ‘but for’ the masterminds, this blast should have  never  seen\nthe daylight.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1257\">517)  Accordingly, to differentiate the degree  of  punishment  to  A-1  and\nother 10 appellants, we contemplate  that  the  ends  of  justice  would  be\nserved if the  death  sentence  of  these  ten  appellants  be  commuted  to\nimprisonment for life.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1258\">518)  With a note of caution, we reiterate that it  is  ordinarily  expected\nthat two accused  convicted  of  similar  crimes  in  similar  circumstances\nshould  not  in  practice  receive  very  different  sentences,  often   the\ndifferences are more significant than the similarities, and  the  mitigating\nand aggravating factors dictate different  results.  Therefore,  the  lesser\nsentence imposed on these 10 appellants  cannot  be  a  precedent  in  other\ncases  and  every  case  must  be  decided  according  to  their  facts  and\ncircumstances.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1259\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"116419938\" id=\"span_176\">519)  In view of the above, it is apt to quote a decision of this  Court  in\n<a href=\"/doc/116419938/\" id=\"a_1010\">State of U.P.  vs.  Sanjay  Kumar</a>  (2012)  8  SCC  537,  to  understand  the\nsentencing policy having regard to the nature of the offence and the  manner\nin which it was executed or committed etc.   The  following  paragraphs  are\nrelevant:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1683\">      “21. Sentencing policy is  a  way  to  guide  judicial  discretion  in\n   accomplishing particular sentencing. Generally, two  criteria,  that  is,\n   the seriousness of the crime and the criminal history of the accused, are\n   used to [pic]prescribe punishment. By  introducing  more  uniformity  and\n   consistency into the sentencing process, the objective of the policy,  is\n   to make it easier to predict sentencing outcomes. Sentencing policies are\n   needed to address concerns in relation to unfettered judicial  discretion\n   and lack of uniform and equal treatment of similarly  situated  convicts.\n   The principle of proportionality, as followed  in  various  judgments  of\n   this Court, prescribes that, the punishments should reflect  the  gravity\n   of the offence and also the criminal background of the convict. Thus, the\n   graver the offence and the longer the criminal record, the more severe is\n   the punishment to  be  awarded.  By  laying  emphasis  on  individualised\n   justice, and shaping the result of the crime to the circumstances of  the\n   offender and the needs of the victim and community,  restorative  justice\n   eschews uniformity of sentencing. Undue  sympathy  to  impose  inadequate\n   sentence would do more harm to the public system to undermine the  public\n   confidence in the efficacy of law and society could not long endure under\n   serious threats.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1684\">      22. Ultimately, it becomes the duty of  the  courts  to  award  proper\n   sentence, having regard to the nature of the offence and  the  manner  in\n   which it was executed or committed,  etc.  The  courts  should  impose  a\n   punishment befitting the crime so that the courts are able to  accurately\n   reflect public abhorrence of the crime. It is the nature and  gravity  of\n   the crime, and not the criminal, which are germane for  consideration  of\n   appropriate punishment  in  a  criminal  trial.  Imposition  of  sentence\n   without considering its effect on social order in many cases  may  be  in\n   reality, a futile exercise.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1685\">      23. The survival of an orderly society demands the extinction  of  the\n   life of a person who is proved  to  be  a  menace  to  social  order  and\n   security.  Thus,  the  courts  for  the  purpose  of  deciding  just  and\n   appropriate sentence to be awarded for an  offence,  have  to  delicately\n   balance the aggravating and mitigating factors and circumstances in which\n   a crime has been committed, in a dispassionate manner. In the absence  of\n   any foolproof formula which may provide a basis for  reasonable  criteria\n   to correctly assess various circumstances germane for  the  consideration\n   of the gravity of the crime, discretionary judgment, in relation  to  the\n   facts of each case, is the  only  way  in  which  such  judgment  may  be\n   equitably distinguished. The Court has primarily dissected the principles\n   into two different compartments—one being the “aggravating circumstances”\n   and, the other being the “mitigating circumstance”. To balance the two is\n   the primary duty of the court. The principle of  proportionality  between\n   the crime and the punishment is the  principle  of  “just  deserts”  that\n   serves as the foundation of every criminal sentence that is  justifiable.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1260\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"315677\" id=\"span_177\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"622480\" id=\"span_178\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"800569\" id=\"span_179\">In  other  words,  the  “doctrine  of   proportionality”   has   valuable\n   application  to  the  sentencing  policy  under   the   Indian   criminal\n   jurisprudence. While determining the  quantum  of  punishment  the  court\n   always records sufficient reasons. (<a href=\"/doc/800569/\" id=\"a_1011\">Vide Sevaka Perumal v.

The  life\n   imprisonment cannot be equivalent to imprisonment  for  14  years  or  20\n   years, rather it always meant as the whole natural life. This  Court  has\n   always clarified that the punishment so awarded would be subject  to  any\n   order passed in exercise of the clemency powers of the President of India\n   or the Governor of the State, as the case may be. Pardons, reprieves  and\n   remissions are granted in exercise of  prerogative  power.  There  is  no\n   scope of judicial review of such orders except on very  limited  grounds,\n   for example, non-application  of  mind  while  passing  the  order;  non-\n   consideration  of  relevant  material;  or  if  the  order  suffers  from\n   arbitrariness. The power to grant pardons and  to  commute  sentences  is\n   coupled  with  a  duty  to  exercise  the  same  fairly  and  reasonably.\n   Administration of justice cannot be perverted by executive  or  political\n   pressure. Of course, adoption of uniform standards may  not  be  possible\n   while exercising the power of pardon. Thus, such orders do not  interfere\n   with  the  sovereign  power  of  the  State.  More  so,  not   being   in\n   contravention of any statutory or constitutional provision,  the  orders,\n   even if treated to have been passed under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_1014\">Article 142</a> of the Constitution\n   do not deserve to be labelled as unwarranted. The aforesaid  orders  have\n   been passed considering the gravity of the offences in those  cases  that\n   the accused would not be entitled to be considered for premature  release\n   under the guidelines issued for that purpose i.e. under the Jail  Manual,\n   etc. or even under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1015\">Section 433-A</a> CrPC.”\n\n\n\nLife Imprisonment Means Rigorous Imprisonment:</span></span></span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1686\">520)  There was a misperception that life imprisonment is distinct from  the\npunishment of rigorous  or  simple  imprisonment  shown  in  clause  (4)  of\n<a href=\"/doc/633996/\" id=\"a_1016\">Section 53</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure.

Sub-sections (2) to (5) of Section 432 of the  Code  lay\ndown  basic  procedure  for  making  an  application  to   the   appropriate\nGovernment for suspension or remission of sentence either by the convict  or\nsomeone on his behalf. We are of the view that  exercise  of  power  by  the\nappropriate Government under sub-section (1) of  Section  432  of  the  Code\ncannot be automatic or claimed as a right for the simple reason,  that  this\nis only an enabling provision and the same  would  be  possible  subject  to\nfulfillment of certain conditions. Those conditions are mentioned either  in\nthe Jail Manual or in statutory rules. This  Court,  in  various  decisions,\nhas held that the power of remission cannot  be  exercised  arbitrarily.  In\nother words, the decision to  grant  remission  has  to  be  well  informed,\nreasonable and fair to all concerned. The statutory procedure <a href=\"/doc/116419938/\" id=\"a_1018\">laid  down  in</a>\nSection 432 of the Code itself provides this check on  the  possible  misuse\nof power by the appropriate Government.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1692\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"174283964\" id=\"span_182\">524)  As rightly observed by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/174283964/\" id=\"a_1019\">Sangeet and  Anr.  vs.  State  of\nHaryana</a>, 2012 (11)  Scale  140,  there  is  misconception  that  a  prisoner\nserving life sentence has an indefeasible right to release on completion  of\neither 14  years  or  20  years  imprisonment.  A  convict  undergoing  life\nimprisonment is expected to remain in custody till  the  end  of  his  life,\nsubject to  any  remission  granted  by  the  appropriate  Government  under\nSection 432 of the Code, which in turn is subject to the  procedural  checks\nmentioned in the said provision and to further substantive check in  Section\n433-A of the Code.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1693\">525)  Therefore, pursuant to Sections 432 and 433 of the Code  and  clemency\npowers of President and  Governor,  as  vested  by  the  Constitution  under\nArticles 72 and 161 respectively, the accused persons, viz., A-32, A-36,  A-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1261\">39, A-44, A-10, A-29, A-9, A-11, A-12 and A-16 shall be imprisoned for  life\nuntil their death and the appeals are disposed off on the  above  terms.
