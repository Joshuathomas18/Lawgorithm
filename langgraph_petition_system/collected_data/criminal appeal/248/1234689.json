The first FIR was lodged\n\nby Meenaxi Agrawal, (for short, &quot;Meenaxi&quot;) inter alia, alleging that\n\nManoj Narain Agrawal (for short, &quot;Manoj&quot;) along with forty others\n\nraided their farm house and attacked Shashi Agrawal (for short, &quot;Shashi&quot;)\n\nand Meenaxi (Appellant Nos.1 and 2 in Criminal Appeals arising out of\n\nSpecial Leave Petition (Criminal) No.6061-6062 of 2008) as also staff\n\nmembers thereof as a result whereof one R.K. Yadav, an employee\n\nsuffered grievous injuries.    FIR No.960/99 in relation to the said\n\npurported incident was lodged under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_2\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_3\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/838469/\" id=\"a_4\">452</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_5\">323</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_6\">427</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_7\">506</a>, of the Indian Penal Code (for short, &quot;the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">IPC</a>&quot;) at the\n\nKichha Police Station. The accused were allegedly arrested on the spot\n\nby the local police.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">      Another FIR was, however, lodged by Manoj (Appellant in\n\nCriminal Appeal arising out of Special Leave Petition (Criminal)\n\nNo.5419 of 2008) alleging that D.S. Sirohi, Manager of Parag Farm,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                  3</span>\n\nKichha uttered filthy language over his mobile calling names to mother,\n\nsister and also threatened to kill him and when he reached there, some\n\nguards of the Farm, namely, Hans Pal, Munna Lal, Dharmender, etc.\n\nopened fire at him indiscriminately in order to kill him on the order of\n\nD.S. Sirohi, Manager of Farm, R.K. Yadav and Meenaxi. One pellet hit\n\nhim near his heart. It was also stated that he was mercilessly beaten up by\n\nsome of the employees of Meenaxi. The second complaint was registered\n\nas FIR No.960A/99. The FIR lodged by Manoj contained two principal\n\nallegations, viz., (a) overt acts on the part of the accused as a result\n\nwhereof he suffered grievous injuries; and (b) forgery of some documents\n\non the basis whereof some orders had been obtained by them in getting\n\ntheir names mutated in the revenue record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">4.    On the basis of the said FIRs, investigations were carried out.\n\nUpon completion thereof, a charge sheet was filed in relation to the case\n\narising out of FIR No.960/99 lodged by Meenaxi against Manoj and 39\n\nothers under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_10\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_11\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/838469/\" id=\"a_12\">452</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_13\">323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_14\">427</a>, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_15\">506</a> and <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_16\">307</a> of the\n\nIPC; but a final report dated 29.11.1999 was filed in respect of FIR\n\nNo.960A/99, stating that no case was made out against Shashi and\n\nMeenaxi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">5.    However, on or about 1.12.1999, Manoj had filed a writ petition\n\nbeing Writ Petition No. 7230 of 1999 in the High Court of Allahabad\n\npraying for a fair investigation and also for appointment of another\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                  4</span>\n\ninvestigating officer in the Crime No. 960A/99. By reason of an order\n\ndated 1.12.1999, the High Court disposed of the said Writ Petition\n\ndirecting the DIG (Kumaun Region) Udham Singh Nagar, Nainital to\n\nensure fair and impartial investigation with respect to the Crime Case No.\n\n960A/99 by another agency. In view of the said order, the final report\n\ndated 29.11.1999 was sent to the office of Circle Officer (Deputy\n\nSuperintendent of Police) on 3.12.1999. The Deputy Superintendent of\n\nPolice sought for the opinion of the Senior Public Prosecutor on or about\n\n13.12.1999. It was opined that as a part of the allegation has not been\n\ninvestigated into, a further investigation would be required.          On\n\napprehending their arrest, Shashi and Meenaxi filed a Writ Petition No.\n\n310 of 2000 before the High Court of Allahabad praying for stay of their\n\narrest in Crime No. 960A/99.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">6.    On or about 3.4.2000, an application was moved by Shashi before\n\nthe Chief Secretary UP and DG, UP Police praying the investigation to be\n\nconducted by CBCID. As no action was taken thereupon, another Writ\n\nPetition No. 1747 of 2000 was filed by Shashi before the Allahabad High\n\nCourt with a prayer that the investigation in Crime Case No. 960A/99 be\n\ndirected to be carried out by CBCID.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">      Indisputably, a direction was issued by the State of U.P that Crime\n\nNo. 960A/99 be investigated by CBCID pursuant whereto the\n\ninvestigation was taken over by CBCID. On or about 11.5.2000, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                   5</span>\n\ninvestigation in Crime Case No. 960A/99 was transferred from CBCID to\n\nlocal police by the State of U.P. Shashi thereafter filed a Writ Petition\n\nNo. 2996 of 2000 in the High Court with a prayer for direction to set\n\naside the order dated 11.5.2000 passed by the State of U.P. Manoj also\n\nfiled a Writ Petition No. 3848 of 2000 questioning the order dated\n\n6.4.2000 whereby the investigation was transferred by the State\n\nGovernment from local police to CBCID. On or about 4.7.2000, the High\n\nCourt passed an interim order in Writ Petition No. 2996 of 2006 staying\n\nthe arrest of the petitioners. All the connected matters with Writ Petition\n\nNo. 310 of 2000 were disposed of by the High Court on or about\n\n13.9.2000 directing the investigating agency to carry out the investigation\n\nfairly and honestly and not to take any coercive steps against the parties.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">7.    A Special Leave Petition (Criminal) Nos.4054-4057 of 2000 was\n\nfiled by Meenaxi &amp; anr. before this Court questioning the order dated\n\n13.9.2000 passed in Writ Petition No. 310 of 2000 and other connected\n\nmatters. This court by reason of an order dated 7.9.2001 passed in the\n\nsaid Special Leave Petition quashed the order directing investigation by\n\nthe local police and directed the CBCID to conclude the investigation and\n\nto submit its report. However, the protection afforded by the High Court\n\nto Meenaxi was directed to be continued. Local police was directed to\n\nhandover all the materials to CBCID.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                                   6</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">8.    In the meanwhile, trial against Manoj began. By a judgment and\n\norder dated 24.7.2003, passed by the learned Additional District &amp;\n\nSessions Judge, Udham Singh Nagar, he was convicted under <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 324</a>\n\nof the IPC. However, other accused were acquitted.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">9.    An appeal was preferred thereagainst which is pending before the\n\nHigh Court. The sentence passed against Manoj has also been suspended\n\nand he has been granted bail. On or about 2.5.2006, a charge sheet was\n\nfiled against Shashi and Meenaxi under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_18\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_19\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_20\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_21\">307</a>, <a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_22\">504</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_23\">506</a> of the IPC. Shashi was said to have been named therein for the\n\nfirst time. By an order dated 14.6.2006, cognizance of the said offence\n\nwas taken by the Judicial Magistrate, Rudrapur and summons were said to\n\nhave been issued against them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">10.

The learned counsel also drew our attention to a statement made by\n\nManoj in his examination under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 313</a> of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure which would go to show that he raised a plea therein that he\n\nwas not present at the place of occurrence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">19.   The parties as noticed hereinbefore are related to each other.\n\nManoj is the son of Shashi. Meenaxi is his sister. It is evident that\n\ndisputes relate to a farm house. Allegations and counter allegations have\n\nbeen made. Both sides lodged FIRs. Whereas the FIR lodged by Manoj\n\nis concerned, only charge sheet had been filed in the case charged against\n\nhim, he has since been convicted. As correctness of the said conviction is\n\npending before the High Court and the sentence of Manoj has been\n\nsuspended, it is neither desirable nor permissible in law to make any\n\nobservation thereupon. The facts of the matter, as noticed hereinbefore,\n\nclearly show that the investigation in the connected matter being Crime\n\nNo. 960A of 1999 run from one extreme end to the other. Final reports\n\nwere prepared twice. However, the Deputy Superintendent of Police,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                                   13</span>\n\nCBCID on the second final report so prepared sought to obtain the legal\n\nopinion of the public prosecutor. Such a course adopted may be irregular\n\nbut it is not denied or disputed that a vital aspect of the matter of the\n\ninvestigation had not been carried out. It is not the case of the appellants,\n\ni.e., Shashi and Meenaxi that the opinion given by the public prosecutor\n\nwas incorrect. We have noticed hereinbefore that even otherwise the\n\nlearned Magistrate has granted such permission.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">20.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117903\" id=\"span_13\">In <a href=\"/doc/117903/\" id=\"a_34\">Kamlapati Trivedi vs. State of West Bengal</a> [(1980) 2 SCC 91],\n\nthis Court held:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"49832\" id=\"span_14\">&quot;50. <a href=\"/doc/477003/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 169</a> and <a href=\"/doc/159157/\" id=\"a_36\">170</a> do not talk of the\n             submission of any report by the police to the\n             Magistrate, although they do state what the\n             police has to do short of such submission when\n             it finds at the conclusion of the investigation (1)\n             that there is not sufficient evidence or\n             reasonable ground of suspicion to justify the\n             forwarding of the accused to a Magistrate\n             (<a href=\"/doc/477003/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 169</a>) or (2) that there is sufficient\n             evidence or reasonable ground as aforesaid\n             (<a href=\"/doc/159157/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 170</a>).

It appears that unfortunately the High Court\n             by exercising its inherent jurisdiction under\n             <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 482</a> of the Criminal Procedure Code\n             (for short &quot;the Code&quot;) has prevented the flow of\n             justice on the alleged contention of the\n             convicted accused that it was polluted by so\n             called misconduct of the judicial officer. It is\n             true that under <a href=\"/doc/903398/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 482</a> of the Code, the\n             High Court has inherent powers to make such\n             orders as may be necessary to give effect to any\n             order under the Code or to prevent the abuse of\n             process of any Court or otherwise to secure the\n             ends of justice. But the expressions &quot;abuse of\n             the process of law&quot; or &quot;to secure the ends of\n             justice&quot; do not confer unlimited jurisdiction on\n             the High Court and the alleged abuse of the\n             process of law or the ends of justice could only\n             be secured in accordance with law including\n             procedural law and not otherwise. Further,\n             inherent powers are in the nature of\n             extraordinary powers to be used sparingly for\n             achieving the object mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/903398/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 482</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                   <a href=\"/doc/1638420/\" id=\"a_52\">18</a></span>\n\n             of the Code in cases where there is no express\n             provision empowering the High Court to\n             achieve the said object. It is well neigh settled\n             that inherent power is not to be invoked in\n             respect of any matter covered by specific\n             provisions of the Code or if its exercise would\n             infringe any specific provision of the Code. In\n             the present case, the High Court overlooked the\n             procedural law which empowered the convicted\n             accused to prefer statutory appeal against\n             conviction of the offence. High Court has\n             intervened at an uncalled for stage and soft-\n             pedaled the course of justice at a very crucial\n             stage of the trial.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"288555\" id=\"span_24\">In <a href=\"/doc/288555/\" id=\"a_53\">Hamida vs. Rashid</a> alias Rasheed &amp; ors.

[(2005) 3 SCC\n\n299], this Court took into consideration subsequent events for the purpose\n\nof exercising its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure, stating:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_68\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">            &quot;9. In view of the above said subsequent\n            events and the conduct of the appellant, it would\n            be an abuse of the process of the court if the\n            criminal proceedings from which this appeal\n            arises is allowed to continue. Therefore, we are\n            of the considered opinion to do complete\n            justice, we should while dismissing this appeal\n            also quash proceedings arising from the\n            Criminal Case No.Cr.No.224/2003 registered in\n            Police Station, Bilaspur, (Distt.Rampur) filed\n            under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_61\">Sections 498A</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_62\">323</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_63\">506</a> IPC and\n            under <a href=\"/doc/751411/\" id=\"a_64\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1023340/\" id=\"a_65\">4</a> of the Dowry Prohibition\n            Act against the respondents herein.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">\f                                    21</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">29.   Contention of Mr. Sushil Kumar is that while filing a charge sheet,\n\nthe Investigating Officer did not follow the directions given by this Court\n\nin its order dated 7.9.2001 whereby and whereunder the Investigating\n\nAgency was directed to consider the report dated 29.11.1999 submitted\n\nby Mr. Naresh Pal. It is again not a matter to take which requires serious\n\nconsideration at this stage. It does not appear that any such contention\n\nwas raised before the High Court, the effect thereof must be considered\n\nby the courts at an appropriate stage. It is also difficult for us to arrive at\n\na positive decision that the FIR lodged by Manoj was only retaliatory in\n\nnature as he had not suffered any bullet injury. It is a matter of trial.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_70\">      Submission of Mr. Sushil Kumar that the order passed by the\n\nJudicial Magistrate, Rudrapur on the final report filed in FIR No. 960A of\n\n1999 has not been brought on record is not very significant as the\n\nappellants also could have filed a certified copy of the said order if the\n\nsaid final report had been accepted. When the charge sheet was filed, the\n\nlearned Magistrate, of course, should have been informed that further\n\ninvestigation was to be carried out but it is now well known that a further\n\ninvestigation can be directed to be made in terms of <a href=\"/doc/274924/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 173(8)</a> of the\n\nCode of Criminal Procedure even after an order taking cognizance has\n\nbeen passed. Mr. Sushil Kumar may be right in his contention that even\n\nafter disposal of the matter an application was filed for carrying out\n\nfurther investigation after a period of seven and a half years, but the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">\f                                  22</span>\n\nquestion as to whether the learned Magistrate should have passed the said\n\norder dated 31.7.2008 or not had not been considered by the High Court.\n\nTherefore, we request the High Court to consider the matter afresh.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">30.   We, therefore, set aside the orders passed by the High Court in its\n\norder dated 11.8.2008 opining that the same was beyond its jurisdiction\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure. It is, however,\n\nmade clear that all contentions of the parties shall remain open. It is\n\nfurthermore made clear that the parties hereto may approach the High\n\nCourt in Criminal Miscellaneous Application No. 518 of 2008.\n\nAllegations of mala fide made against the State may also be gone into.\n\nThe High Court can pass any such interim order as it may think and\n\nproper. For a period of four weeks, however, the interim order passed by\n\nthis Court shall continue.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">31.   So far as the Criminal Appeals arising out of Special Leave Petition\n\n(Criminal) No. 6061-6062 of 2008 and Special Leave Petition (Criminal)\n\nNo. 6136-37 are concerned, there cannot be any doubt whatsoever that\n\nthe jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 482</a> of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure is limited. It is ordinarily for the learned Magistrate\n\nto consider as to whether a case for grant of bail has been made out or\n\nnot, the High Court, therefore, may not be correct in observing, &quot;I am\n\nquite convinced that valid grounds exist for granting bail to the\n\npetitioners.&quot; Similarly, the High Court should not have, for all intent and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                    23</span>\n\npurport, issued the direction for grant of exemption from personal\n\nappearance. Such a matter undoubtedly shall be left for the consideration\n\nbefore the learned Magistrate. We are sure that the Magistrate would\n\nexercise his jurisdiction in a fair and judicious manner. The impugned\n\ndirections are set aside and the maters are remitted to the High court for\n\nconsideration of the application filed before it by the parties afresh on\n\nmerit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">32.
