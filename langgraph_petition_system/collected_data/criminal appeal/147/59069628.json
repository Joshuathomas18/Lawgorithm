To support the aforesaid, he submitted that the eye-\nwitnesses     Lakhan(PW5),           Vijay(PW9)     and      Surendra\nMalviya(PW14)       in their statement have not made any\nallegation   against     accused     Sohan(appellant        in    Cri.A.\nNo.221/2003).\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">16.   Eye-witness Chandrashekhar(PW6) in para 2 and 3 of\nhis court statement         has stated the name of appellant\nSohan(appellant in Cri.A. No.221/2003), but he has not\nstated the name of appellant Sohan in his police statement\n(Ex-D/4) recorded on 7/09/2000. PW6 in his supplementary\nstatement (Ex-D/6), which was recorded on 1/12/2000 has\ndeposed the name of appellant Sohan.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">17.   Similarly, eye-witness Jaheer (PW8) has deposed the\nname of accused Sohan(appellant in Cri.A. No.221/2003) in\npara 2 of his court statement but he has not made any\nstatement against him in his police statement(Ex-D/7),\nrecorded on 8/09/2000, which is evident from para 5 of his\nstatement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">18.   In respect of appellant No.9 Bhagat( in Cri. A.\n                                              CRA No.221 &amp; 293 of 2003\n\nNo.293/2003), learned Senior Counsel Shri C.L.

Eye-witness\nJaheer(PW8) has made an allegation against appellant No.9\nBhagat in para 2 and 3 of his statement but he has not stated\nhis name in his police statement (Ex-D/7) and when he was\nconfronted with his police statement (Ex-D/7), he admitted this\nfact in para 5 of the statement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">19.    Similarly eye-witness Surendra Malviya(PW14) has\nstated the name of appellant No.9 Bhagat( in Cri.

He submitted that there are material\nimprovements in para 2 and 25 of the statement of Surendra\nMalviya(PW14). In para - 2 he has deposed that appellant\nNo.9    Bhagat was armed with lathi whereas in his police\nstatement (Ex-D/9) he has stated that appellant No.9 was\narmed with Sword and, thus, he is an interested witness and,\ntherefore,   the       statement   of   eye-witness     Surendra\nMalviya(PW14) is doubtful and is not reliable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">20.    In respect of appellant No.8 - Laxman (in Cri. A.\nNo.293/2003),      eye-witnesses Vijay(PW9) and Surendra\nMalviya(PW14) have not made any allegation against\nappellant No.8. Another eye-witness Lakhan(PW5) has stated\nabout the presence of appellant No.8 - Laxman in para 3 and\n4 of his statement, but there is no overt act attributed against\nappellant No.8 during the alleged incident as is evident from\n                                               CRA No.221 &amp; 293 of 2003\n\npara - 13 of his statement. Chandrashekhar(PW6), another\neye-witness in his statement has stated the name of appellant\nNo.8 - Laxman in para - 2 and 3 of his court statement, but\nthere is no allegation about any overt act by him during the\nalleged incident. Last eye-witness Jaheer(PW8) in para 2 and\n3 of his statement has stated the name of appellant No.8 -\nLaxman, but there is no allegation about any overt act by him\nduring the alleged offence.     In police statement(Ex-D/7) of\nJaheer(PW8), name of appellant No.8 - Laxman was also\nmissing and this fact has been admitted by Jaheer(PW8) in\npara - 5 of his statement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">21.   In respect of appellant No.11 - Mannu Yadav(in Cri.A.\nNo.293/2003), it is submitted that Lakhan(PW5), Jaheer(PW8),\nVijay(PW9) and Surendra Malviya(PW14), eye-witnesses of\nthe case have not made any allegation against him.\nChandrashekar(PW6), last eye-witness of the case in para - 2\nof his court statement has stated the name of appellant No.11\nMannu Yadav, but there is no allegation about any overt act\nby him during the alleged incident as is evident from the police\nstatement(Ex-D/4) of Chandrashekar(PW6). He submitted that\nlooking to the conduct of the eye-witnesses, it is a case of\nfalse implication against appellant Sohan S/o Lalsaingh\n(appellant in Cri.A. No.221/2003) and        appellants No.8 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">Laxman,     No.9      -    Bhagat   and    No.11       -    Mannu\nYadav(appellants in Cri.A. No.293/2003).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">22.   The contention of Shri C.L. Yadav, learned Senior\nCounsel is that if we scrutinize the testimony of all the eye-\nwitnesses    namely       Lakhan(PW5),    Chandrashekar(PW6),\nJaheer(PW8),          Vijay   Rathore(PW9)      and        Surendra\n                                              CRA No.221 &amp; 293 of 2003\n\nMalviya(PW14), their evidence is found to be discrepant in its\nmaterial particulars and on the basis of their evidence, it is\nquite unsafe to act upon the evidence of aforesaid eye-\nwitnesses whose testimony are clouded with grave suspicion\nand serious doubts and submitted that it is unsafe to convict\nthe appellants and, therefore, for all the aforementioned\nreasons, the impugned judgment is liable to be set aside.

Learned Senior Counsel for the appellants submits that\nthey are all interested witnesses and they have falsely\nimplicated the appellants and there is no guarantee whether\nthey are speaking the truth against other accused. It is also\n                                               CRA No.221 &amp; 293 of 2003\n\ntheir statement that the prosecution has deliberately omitted to\nexamine individual witnesses from the locality in which the\noccurrence has taken place and submitted that the appeals be\nallowed and the appellants be acquitted from the alleged\noffence, as the prosecution has failed to prove its case beyond\nreasonable doubt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">29.   Shri Deepak Rawal, learned Deputy Advocate General\nappearing for the respondent / State, submits that though as\nper the statement of eye witnesses, no allegation has been\nmade against appellant Sohan s/o Lal Singh Dhakad (in\nCriminal Appeal No.221/2003) and appellant No.9 Bhagat s/o\nRajaram Yadav, appellant No.8 Laxman s/o Gangaram Gawli,\nappellant No.1 Pawan Yadav s/o Kanhaiyalal, appellant No.6\nNarsimb s/o Lalji Gawli and appellant No.2 Nandu @\nNandkishore    s/o   Omkarlal    Gawli   in   Criminal      Appeal\nNo.293/2003; and there are material omissions in the\nstatement of eye witnesses, but as per their statement, specific\nallegation has been made against appellant No.4 Ashok\nSarpata s/o Sudama Bhau that he attacked deceased Roshan\nwith sword and inflicted fatal injuries to the deceased Roshan.\nAs per postmortem report Ex.P/54, the deceased sustained 12\ntwelve incised wounds and six contusions. The learned trial\ncourt relied upon the evidence of eye witnesses as against all\nthe accused except accused No.2 Shankarlal @ Shankar\nPahalwan s/o Puranlal Yadav by holding that he was not a\nmember of the unlawful assembly, nor he was identified by the\nprosecution witnesses and convicted them, as mentioned\nabove.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">30.   As per statement of material prosecution witnesses,\n                                                 CRA No.221 &amp; 293 of 2003\n\nthere is rivalry between the accused, who wanted to start new\nunion and the union of the deceased. The material witnesses\nare all interested witnesses. Out of total seven eye witnesses,\nwhich were examined before the learned trial Court, Rajendra\n@ Gannu Sharma (PW-2) and Dinesh (PW-3) did not support\nthe case of the prosecution and they have been declared\nhostile. Rest five eye witnesses namely complainant Lakhan\n(PW-5), Chandrashekhar Joshi (PW-6), Jaheer (PW-8), Vijay\nRathore (PW-9) and Surendra Malviya (PW-14), though\nnamed    against     appellant     Sohan   in   Criminal       appeal\nNo.221/2003    and     appellant    No.1   Pawan        Yadav       s/o\nKanhaiyalal, appellant No.2 Nandu @ Nandkishore s/o\nOmkarlal Gawli, appellant No.3 Sonu @ Sohan Singh s/o\nNarain Singh Jhala, appellant No.6 Narsimb s/o Lalji Gawli,\nappellant No.7 Babu @ Kamal Gawli s/o Ramchand Ghasita,\nappellant No.8 Laxman s/o Gangaram Gawli, appellant No.9\nBhagat s/o Rajaram Yadav, appellant No.10 Mangal s/o Man\nSingh Yadav, appellant No.11 Mannu Yadav s/o Kishanlal and\nappellant No.12 Kannu @ Kanhaiyalal s/o Ambaram Balia in\nCriminal Appeal No.293/2003. All the five eye witnesses in\ntheir statement have not made any allegation against them.\nSome of the eye witnesses in their Court statement made\nallegation against them, but there is omission in their police\nstatement, nor any overt act has been attributed against them.\nWe have examined the evidence of these five eye witnesses\nand their cross-examination and we are satisfied that they are\nhighly interested witnesses, and therefore, we are not\nprepared to accept the prosecution version that appellant\nSohan in Criminal appeal No.221/2003 and appellant No.1\n                                                 CRA No.221 &amp; 293 of 2003\n\nPawan Yadav s/o Kanhaiyalal, appellant No.2 Nandu @\nNandkishore s/o Omkarlal Gawli, appellant No.3 Sonu @\nSohan Singh s/o Narain Singh Jhala, appellant No.6 Narsimb\ns/o Lalji Gawli, appellant No.7 Babu @ Kamal Gawli s/o\nRamchand Ghasita, appellant No.8 Laxman s/o Gangaram\nGawli, appellant No.9 Bhagat s/o Rajaram Yadav, appellant\nNo.10 Mangal s/o Man Singh Yadav, appellant No.11 Mannu\nYadav   s/o   Kishanlal     and   appellant    No.12     Kannu      @\nKanhaiyalal   s/o   Ambaram       Balia   in    Criminal      Appeal\nNo.293/2003, in any way, participated in the crime and inflicted\ninjuries to the deceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">31.   In respect of appellant No.4 Ashok Sarpata, complainant\nLakhan (PW-5), Chandrashekhar Joshi (PW-6), Jaheer (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">8), Vijay Rathore (PW-9) and Surendra Malviya (PW-14) in\ntheir statement very categorically stated that he was armed\nwith sword and inflicted injuries to deceased Roshan.             The\naforesaid fact further find supports from the statement of\nHukum Singh Yadav (PW-15), who in paragraph No.12 of his\nstatement has made material evidence of his involvement and\ncausing sword injuries to the deceased Roshan on his head.\nRecovery of arm has also been proved.               The aforesaid\nadmission goes to show that appellant No.4 Ashok assaulted\nthe deceased and caused fatal injuries to him.             Thus, we\ncannot accept the argument of Shri S.R. Saraf, learned Senior\nCounsel that appellant No.4 Ashok Sarpata was falsely\nimplicated and statement of the interested witnesses are highly\nsuspicious on the ground that in identical circumstances in\nrespect of accused No.2 Shankarlal @ Shankar Pahalwan s/o\nPuranlal Yadav, learned trial Court disbelieved the statement\n                                               CRA No.221 &amp; 293 of 2003\n\nof eye witnesses Lakhan (PW-5) and Chandrashekhar Joshi\n(PW-6) that accused No.2 Shankarlal @ Shankar Pahalwan\ncaused any injuries to the deceased and acquitted him. As\nalready observed that evidence of partisan witnesses cannot\nbe rejected outright in respect of appellant No.4 Ahsok\nSarpata.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">32.   As a general rule, a court can and may act on a\ntestimony of a single witness though uncorroborated provided\nthat testimony of that single witness is found out entirely\nreliable. In that case, there will be no legal impediment for\nrecording a conviction. But, if the evidence is open to doubt or\nsuspicion, the court will require sufficient corroboration. As per\nrecord, name of Ravi, Shekhar, Panna and Mohit has been\ndeleted during investigation vide Ex.D/2 and Ex.D/5, on\napplication for deleting their name.          This shows that\ncomplainant Lakhan (PW-5) adopted the method of pick and\nchoose and stated that the above four persons were not\ninvolved in the alleged offence.     All the five eye witnesses\nnamely Lakhan (PW-5), Chandrashekhar Joshi (PW-6), Jaheer\n(PW-8), Vijay Rathore (PW-9) and Surendra Malviya (PW-14)\nin their statement have not made any allegation against some\nof the twelve appellants and they in their cross-examination\nadmitted the omissions of allegations and their name in their\npolice statement.    Thus, in view of the aforesaid, we are\nsatisfied that the evidence of five eye witnesses Lakhan (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">5), Chandrashekhar Joshi (PW-6), Jaheer (PW-8), Vijay\nRathore (PW-9) and Surendra Malviya (PW-14) seems to be\nnot proper to rely upon the prosecution case with respect to\nthe eleven appellants and we are of the considered view that\n                                                CRA No.221 &amp; 293 of 2003\n\ntheir evidence does not inspire confidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">33.   Here is the case where witnesses for the reasons best\nknown to them given clean chit to accused No.2 Shankarlal\nand during investigation name of Ravi, Shekhar, Panna and\nMohit has been deleted, on the basis of letter dated\n01.12.2000 vide Ex.D/2 of complainant Lakhan (PW-5).\nImmediately on the same day, supplementary statement of\nLakhan (PW-5) vide Ex.D/3 and Chandra Shekhar (PW-6) vide\nEx.D/6 was recorded. It is not the case where the Court on\nappreciation of the prosecution evidence of some of the\npartisan witnesses for reasons best known to them given clean\nchit to four accused persons implicated by the eye witnesses\ncomplainant Lakhan (PW-5) and Chandra Shekar (WP-6)\nearlier before the police and blamed only rest of the accused\npersons for the attack on them at the trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">34.   Thus, glaring feature in the evidence can be seen by a\nmere perusal of the deposition of five material prosecution\nwitnesses, which, in our considered opinion, has rendered\ntheir testimony as wholly unreliable. This is a case where it is\nnot possible to disengage the truth from the falsehood and to\nsieve the grain from the chaff.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">35.   Truth and falsehood in the instant case are so in\ninextricably mixed together that it is difficult to separate them.\nThe finding of guilt recorded by the Court below against the\npresent   appellants    except    appellant    No.4     Ashok       is\nunsustainable in law and on facts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">36.   In view of these circumstances and the evidence\ndiscussed above, we are clearly of the view that the\n                                            CRA No.221 &amp; 293 of 2003\n\nprosecution case against eleven appellants has not been\nproved beyond reasonable doubt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">37.
