It appears that in the\n              case of Baladin2, the members of the family of the\n              appellants and other residents of the village had\n              assembled together; some of them shared the common\n              object of the unlawful assembly, while others were\n              merely passive witnesses. Dealing with such an\n              assembly, this Court observed that the presence of a\n              person in an assembly of that kind would not\n              necessarily show that he was a member of an un-\n              lawful assembly. What has to be proved against a\n              person who is alleged to be a member of an unlawful\n              assembly is that he was one of the persons\n              constituting the assembly ,and he entertained along\n              with the other members of the assembly the common\n              object as defined by<a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_21\"> s.141</a>, I.P.C. <a href=\"/doc/1364868/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 142</a> provides\n              that whoever, being aware of facts which render any\n              assembly an unlawful assembly, intentionally joins\n              that assembly, or continues in it, is said to be a\n              member of an unlawful assembly. In other words, an\n              assembly of five or more persons actuated by, and\n              entertaining one or more of the common objects\n              specified by the five clauses of<a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_23\"> s. 141</a>, is an unlawful\n              assembly. The crucial question to determine in such a\n              case is whether the assembly consisted of five or more\n              persons and whether the said persons entertained one\n              or more of the common objects as specified by<a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_24\"> s.141</a>.\n              While determining this question, it becomes relevant\n              to consider whether the assembly consisted of some\n              persons who were merely passive witnesses and had\n              joined the assembly as a matter of idle curiosity\n              without intending to entertain the common object of\n              the assembly. It is in that context that the observations\n              made by this Court in the case of Baladin2 assume\n              significance; otherwise, in law, it would not be correct\n              to say that before a person is held to be a member of\n\fCrl.

In fact, s.149 makes it clear\n                 that if an offence is committed by any member of an\n                 unlawful assembly in prosecution of the common\n                 object of that assembly, or such as the members of\n                 that assembly knew to be likely to be committed in\n                 prosecution of that object, every person who, at the\n                 time of the committing of that offence. is a member of\n                 the same assembly, is guilty of that offence; and that\n                 emphatically brings out the principle that the\n                 punishment prescribed by<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_26\"> s.149</a> is in a sense vicarious\n                 and does not always proceed on the basis that the\n                 offence has been actually committed by every\n                 member of the unlawful assembly. Therefore, we are\n                 satisfied that the observations made in the case of\n                 Baladin2 must be read in the context of the special\n                 facts of that case and cannot be treated as laying down\n                 an unqualified proposition of law such as Mr.\n                 Sawhney suggests.”\n\n                                                     (underlined by us)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"186917058\" id=\"span_22\">10.

The difficulty may however arise,\n              while considering the liability and extent of\n              culpability of those who may not have actually\n              committed the offence but were members of that\n              assembly.

Existence of\n              common object can be ascertained from the attending\n              facts and circumstances. For example, if more than\n              five persons storm into the house of the victim where\n              only few of them are armed while the others are not\n              and the armed persons open an assault, even unarmed\n              persons are vicariously liable for the acts committed\n              by those armed persons. In such a situation it may not\n              be difficult to ascertain the existence of common\n              object as all the persons had stormed into the house of\n              the victim and it could be assessed with certainty that\n              all were guided by the common object, making every\n              one of them liable. Thus when the persons forming\n              the assembly are shown to be having same interest in\n              pursuance of which some of them come armed, while\n              others may not be so armed, such unarmed persons if\n              they share the same common object, are liable for the\n              acts committed by the armed persons.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1145437\" id=\"span_29\">11.
