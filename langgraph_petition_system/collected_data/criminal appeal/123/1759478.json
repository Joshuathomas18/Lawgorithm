Seema Sharma gave statement to the police alleging \nthat on 24.2.1997 at about 4.15 p.m. she was present in her \nhouse bearing No.28-B, pocket-B Sidharth Extension, New \nDelhi when she heard her door bell ringing and her maid \nservant Kamla @ Kharpai went to open the door.  Accused \nJalveer who is related to the complainant along with his three \nassociates entered the house.  Complainant was standing in \nthe balcony where all the four reached.  All the three \nassociates of Jalveer took out knives, Jalveer also took out \nknife from his pocket.  Two of the associates of accused \nJalveer caught hold of the complainant and dragged her to her \nbed room where she was beaten and accused made enquiries \nabout gold kept in her house and when she did not give any \ninformation, they kicked her on her stomach.  They removed a \ngold chain along with locket and jumkas with chain from her \near.  When Kamla, the maid servant of the complainant, tried \nto intervene, two of the associates of the accused Jalveer tied a \nblouse around the neck of the complainant as a result of \nwhich she became unconscious for sometime.  After sometime \nshe heard the screams of Kamla @ Kharpai, her maid servant, \nand when she saw, a nylon string was tied around her neck \nand she was lying on the floor, Jalveer along with his associate \nthereafter fled away from the spot.  Complainant was admitted \nin the hospital.  Police party reached at the spot, dead body of \nKamla was removed to AIIMS where postmortem was \nconducted on her dead body.  Subsequently, accused Mahabir \nand Mahesh were arrested by the police of police station \nHazarat Nizamuddin.  A VCR, ear rings of this case belonging \nto complainant were recovered from their possession.  They \nmade disclosure statements regarding this case therefore, they \nwere arrested in the present case.  Police applied for holding \nTIP of accused Mahesh and Mahabir but they refused to join \nthe proposed TIP.  The TIP of jewelery articles and VCR \nrecovered from the accused Mahabir and Mahesh was done by \nthe Metropolitan Magistrate.  The complainant correctly \nidentified the articles as well as the jewelery recovered from \nthe possession of these accused persons.  Subsequently, \naccused Jalveer was arrested in this case and Roopa was also \nformally arrested in this case after production warrants were \nissued.  Photographs of the place of incident were taken, site \nplan was got prepared, finger prints were lifted from the place \nof incident. Statement of witnesses were recorded by the police \nand after investigation of the case they came to the conclusion \nthat the accused persons committed the murder of maid \nservant Kamla and they also committed robbery in the house \nof the complainant.  Accordingly, challan was filed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\tAfter complying with the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1613898/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 207</a> of the \nCode of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter referred to as \nthe &#x27;Code&#x27;) learned Metropolitan Magistrate committed the \ncase to the court of Sessions which in turn assigned the same \nto learned Additional Sessions Judge for trial in accordance \nwith law.                   \n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.\tIn order to establish its accusations the prosecution \nexamined 19 witnesses out of which Smt. Seema Sharma (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">4) was the eye-witness to the incident.  Placing reliance on her \nevidence and the test identification parade of the accused \npersons and the articles, the Trial Court convicted both and \nsentenced as aforesaid.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">5.\tBefore the High Court the primary stand was that PW4 \nhad accepted to have seen the accused Mahabir at the time of \nhis arrest and, therefore, the test identification parade was of \nno consequence and rightly accused-appellant Mahabir had \nrefused to take part in it.  So far as accused Jalvir is \nconcerned, it was stated that the complainant did not know \nhis father&#x27;s name and address and, therefore, could not have \nmade accusations so far as he is concerned. It was also \npointed out that in the first information report name of Jalvir \nwas mentioned though PW4 herself accepted that she was \nunconscious for four days.  \n</p>          \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">7.\tThe High Court did not find any substance in such plea.  \nIt noted that though accused was shown to her, that actually \ndid not dilute the evidentiary value and also that was not \nrelevant as the accused refused to take part in the test \nidentification parade. It was also noted that accused Jalvir was \nknown to the witness and, therefore, there was no difficulty in \nmentioning his name in the first information report.  \nAccordingly, the conviction and sentence as recorded by the \nTrial Court came to be affirmed.   \n</p>\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">8.\tIn support of the appeals, learned counsel for the \nappellant submitted that the identification after the accused \nwas shown to the witness is really of no consequence. Further, \nso far as accused Jalvir is concerned, he is barely known to \nPW4.  He was not a frequent visitor to the house of the \naccused and, therefore, it was not possible for her to identify \nthe said accused.    \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">9.\tLearned counsel for the respondent-State supported the \nimpugned order of the High Court which affirmed the \nconviction and sentence as recorded by the Trial Court.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">10.\tWe shall deal with the appeal filed by the accused \nMahabir.  From the evidence of PW4 it is clear that after the \nincident accused Mahabir and Mahesh were shown to PW4 at \nthe time of their arrest.  In fact, police brought many persons \nfor identification of culprits and identified Mahabir and \nMahesh to PW4.  She admitted that these two persons were \nbrought to the hospital. Subsequently, she had identified them \nin Court.  So far as recovery of the VCR is concerned, which \nwas treated as a ground for holding Mahabir and Jalvir guilty,   \nshe accepted that it was not told to her about recovery of VCR.  \nShe was told by the police that VCR had been recovered after   \nthe police persons had brought Mahabir and Mahesh. \nInterestingly, she also accepted that Mahabir and Mahesh \nwere brought to the hospital where she was asked to identify \nthem.       \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"99578\" id=\"span_1\">11.\tAs was observed by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/99578/\" id=\"a_4\">Matru v. State of U.P.</a> \n(1971 (2) SCC 75) identification tests do not constitute \nsubstantive evidence. They are primarily meant for the \npurpose of helping the investigating agency with an assurance \nthat their progress with the investigation into the offence is \nproceeding on the right lines. The identification can only be \nused as corroborative of the statement in court.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"56524\" id=\"span_2\">(See <a href=\"/doc/56524/\" id=\"a_5\">Santokh \nSingh v. Izhar Hussain</a> (1973 (2) SCC 406). The necessity for \nholding an identification parade can arise only when the \naccused are not previously known to the witnesses. The whole \nidea of a test identification parade is that witnesses who claim \nto have seen the culprits at the time of occurrence are to \nidentify them from the midst of other persons without any aid \nor any other source. The test is done to check upon their \nveracity. In other words, the main object of holding an \nidentification parade, during the investigation stage, is to test \nthe memory of the witnesses based upon first impression and \nalso to enable the prosecution to decide whether all or any of \nthem could be cited as eyewitnesses of the crime. The \nidentification proceedings are in the nature of tests and \nsignificantly, therefore, there is no provision for it in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_6\">Code \nand the Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> (in short the &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_7\">Evidence \nAct</a>&#x27;). It is desirable that a test identification parade should be \nconducted as soon as possible after the arrest of the accused. \nThis becomes necessary to eliminate the possibility of the \naccused being shown to the witnesses prior to the test \nidentification parade. This is a very common plea of the \naccused and, therefore, the prosecution has to be cautious to \nensure that there is no scope for making such allegation. If, \nhowever, circumstances are beyond control and there is some \ndelay, it cannot be said to be fatal to the prosecution.</span> \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">12.\tIt is trite to say that the substantive evidence is the \nevidence of identification in Court. Apart from the clear \nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 9</a> of the Evidence Act, the position in law \nis well settled by a catena of decisions of this Court. The facts, \nwhich establish the identity of the accused persons, are \nrelevant under <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 9</a> of the Evidence Act. As a general \nrule, the substantive evidence of a witness is the statement \nmade in Court. The evidence of mere identification of the \naccused person at the trial for the first time is from its very \nnature inherently of a weak character. The purpose of prior \ntest identification, therefore, is to test and strengthen the \ntrustworthiness of that evidence. It is accordingly considered a \nsafe rule of prudence to generally look for corroboration of the \nsworn testimony of witnesses in Court as to the identity of the \naccused who are strangers to them, in the form of earlier \nidentification proceedings. This rule of prudence, however, is \nsubject to exceptions, when, for example, the Court is \nimpressed by a particular witness on whose testimony it can \nsafely rely, without such or other corroboration. The \nidentification parades belong to the stage of investigation, and \nthere is no provision in the Code which obliges the \ninvestigating agency to hold or confers a right upon the \naccused to claim, a test identification parade. They do not \nconstitute substantive evidence and these parades are \nessentially governed by <a href=\"/doc/1762984/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 162</a> of the Code. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117134\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"794096\" id=\"span_4\">Failure to \nhold a test identification parade would not make inadmissible \nthe evidence of identification in Court. The weight to be \nattached to such identification should be a matter for the \nCourts of fact. In appropriate cases it may accept the evidence \nof identification even without insisting on corroboration. (See \n<a href=\"/doc/794096/\" id=\"a_11\">Kanta Prashad v. Delhi Administration</a> (<a href=\"/doc/117134/\" id=\"a_12\">AIR 1958 SC 350), \nVaikuntam Chandrappa and others v. State of Andhra \nPradesh</a> (AIR 1960 SC 1340), Budhsen and another v. State of \nU.P. (AIR 1970 SC 1321) and Rameshwar Singh v. State of \nJammu and Kashmir (AIR 1972 SC 102).</span></span> \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">13.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1956474\" id=\"span_5\">In <a href=\"/doc/1956474/\" id=\"a_13\">Jadunath Singh and another v. The State of Uttar \nPradesh</a> (1970) 3 SCC 518), the submission that absence of \ntest identification parade in all cases is fatal, was repelled by \nthis Court after exhaustive considerations of the authorities on \nthe subject. That was a case where the witnesses had seen the \naccused over a period of time. The High Court had found that \nthe witnesses were independent witnesses having no affinity \nwith deceased and entertained no animosity towards the \nappellant. They had claimed to have known the appellants for \nthe last 6-7 years as they had been frequently visiting the \ntown of Bewar.</span> This Court noticed the observations in an \nearlier unreported decision of this Court in Parkash Chand \nSogani v. The State of Rajasthan (Criminal Appeal No. 92 of \n1956 decided on January 15, 1957), wherein it was observed:- \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">&quot;It is also the defence case that Shiv Lal did \nnot know the appellant. But on a reading of \nthe evidence of P.W. 7 it seems to us clear \nthat Shiv Lal knew the appellant by sight. \nThough he made a mistake about his name \nby referring to him as Kailash Chandra, it was \nwithin the knowledge of Shiv Lal that the \nappellant was a brother of Manak Chand and \nhe identified him as such. These \ncircumstances are quite enough to show that \nthe absence of the identification parade would \nnot vitiate the evidence. A person who is well-\nknown by sight as the brother of Manak \nChand, even before the commission of the \noccurrence, need not be put before an \nidentification parade in order to be marked \nout. We do not think that there is any \njustification for the contention that the \nabsence of the identification parade or a \nmistake made as to his name, would be \nnecessarily fatal to the prosecution case in \nthe circumstances.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">The Court concluded: \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">&quot;It seems to us that it has been clearly laid \ndown by this Court, in Parkash Chand Sogani \nv. The State of Rajasthan (supra) (AIR Cri LJ), \nthat the absence of test identification in all \ncases is not fatal and if the accused person is \nwell-known by sight it would be waste of time \nto put him up for identification. Of course if \nthe prosecution fails to hold identification on \nthe plea that the witnesses already knew the \naccused well and it transpires in the course of \nthe trial that the witnesses did not know the \naccused previously, the prosecution would \nrun the risk of losing its case.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">14.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1763746\" id=\"span_6\">In <a href=\"/doc/1763746/\" id=\"a_14\">Harbhajan Singh v. State of Jammu and Kashmir</a> \n(1975) 4 SCC 480), though a test identification parade was not \nheld, this Court upheld the conviction on the basis of the \nidentification in Court corroborated by other circumstantial \nevidence. In that case it was found that the appellant and one \nGurmukh Singh were absent at the time of roll call and when \nthey were arrested on the night of 16th December, 1971 their \nrifles smelt of fresh gunpowder and that the empty cartridge \ncase which was found at the scene of offence bore distinctive \nmarkings showing that the bullet which killed the deceased \nwas fired from the rifle of the appellant. Noticing these \ncircumstances this Court held:-</span> \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1956474\" id=\"span_7\">&quot;In view of this corroborative evidence we find \nno substance in the argument urged on \nbehalf of the appellant that the Investigating \nOfficer ought to have held an identification \nparade and that the failure of Munshi Ram to \nmention the names of the two accused to the \nneighbours who came to the scene \nimmediately after the occurrence shows that \nhis story cannot be true. As observed by this \nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1956474/\" id=\"a_15\">Jadunath Singh v. State of U.P.</a> (AIR \n1971 SC 363) absence of test identification is \nnot necessarily fatal. The fact that Munshi \nRam did not disclose the names of the two \naccused to the villages only shows that the \naccused were not previously known to him \nand the story that the accused referred to \neach other by their respective names during \nthe course of the incident contains an element \nof exaggeration. The case does not rest on the \nevidence of Munshi Ram alone and the \ncorroborative circumstances to which we have \n<a href=\"/doc/1956474/\" id=\"a_16\">referred to above</a> lend enough assurance to \nthe implication of the appellant.&quot;</span> \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">15.\tIt is no doubt true that much evidentiary value cannot be \nattached to the identification of the accused in Court where \nidentifying witness is a total stranger who had just a fleeting \nglimpse of the person identified or who had no particular \nreason to remember the person concerned, if the identification \nis made for the first time in Court. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">16.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1327640\" id=\"span_8\">In <a href=\"/doc/1327640/\" id=\"a_17\">Ram Nath Mahto v. State of Bihar</a> (1996) 8 SCC 630) \nthis Court upheld the conviction of the appellant even when \nthe witness while deposing in Court did not identify the \naccused out of fear, though he had identified him in the test \nidentification parade. This Court noticed the observations of \nthe trial Judge who had recorded his remarks about the \ndemeanor that the witness perhaps was afraid of the accused \nas he was trembling at the stare of Ram Nath - accused. This \nCourt also relied upon the evidence of the Magistrate, PW-7 \nwho had conducted the test identification parade in which the \nwitness had identified the appellant. This Court found, that in \nthe circumstances if the Courts below had convicted the \nappellant, there was no reason to interfere.</span> \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">17.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144689\" id=\"span_9\">In <a href=\"/doc/144689/\" id=\"a_18\">Suresh Chandra Bahri v. State of Bihar</a> (1995 Supp (1) \nSCC 80), this Court held that it is well settled that substantive \nevidence of the witness is his evidence in the Court but when \nthe accused person is not previously known to the witness \nconcerned then identification of the accused by the witness \nsoon after his arrest is of great importance because it \nfurnishes an assurance that the investigation is proceeding on \nright lines in addition to furnishing corroboration of the \nevidence to be given by the witness later in Court at the trial. \nFrom this point of view it is a matter of great importance, both \nfor the investigating agency and for the accused and a fortiori \nfor the proper administration of justice that such identification \nis held without avoidable and unreasonable delay after the \narrest of the accused. It is in adopting this course alone that \njustice and fair play can be assured both to the accused as \nwell as to the prosecution. Thereafter this Court observed:-</span>  \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">&quot;But the position may be different when the \naccused or a culprit who stands trial had \nbeen seen not once but for quite a number of \ntimes at different point of time and places \nwhich fact may do away with the necessity of \na TI parade.&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">18.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"589310\" id=\"span_10\">In <a href=\"/doc/589310/\" id=\"a_19\">State of Uttar Pradesh v. Boota Singh and others</a> \n(1979 (1) SCC 31), this Court observed that the evidence of \nidentification becomes stronger if the witness has an \nopportunity of seeing the accused not for a few minutes but \nfor some length of time, in broad daylight, when he would be \nable to note the features of the accused more carefully than on \nseeing the accused in a dark night for a few minutes.</span> \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">19.\tIn Ramanbhai Naranbhai Patel and others v. State of \nGujarat (2000 (1) SCC 358) after considering the earlier \ndecisions this Court observed:- \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"849843\" id=\"span_11\">&quot;It becomes at once clear that the aforesaid \nobservations were made in the light of the \npeculiar facts and circumstances wherein the \npolice is said to have given the names of the \naccused to the witnesses. Under these \ncircumstances, identification of such a named \naccused only in the Court when the accused \nwas not known earlier to the witness had to \nbe treated as valueless. The said decision, in \nturn, relied upon an earlier decision of this \nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/849843/\" id=\"a_20\">V.C. Shukla v. State</a> (AIR \n1980 SC 1382) wherein also Fazal Ali, J. \nspeaking for a three-Judge Bench made \nsimilar observations in this regard. In that \ncase the evidence of the witness in the Court \nand his identifying the accused only in the \nCourt without previous identification parade \nwas found to be a valueless exercise. The \nobservations made therein were confined to \nthe nature of the evidence deposed to by the \nsaid eye-witnesses. It, therefore, cannot be \nheld, as tried to be submitted by learned \nCounsel for the appellants, that in the \nabsence of a test identification parade, the \nevidence of an eye-witness identifying the \naccused would become inadmissible or totally \nuseless; whether the evidence deserves any \ncredence or not would always depend on the \nfacts and circumstances of each case.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1200711\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"693619\" id=\"span_13\">It is, of \ncourse, true as submitted by learned Counsel \nfor the appellants that the later decisions of \nthis Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/693619/\" id=\"a_21\">Rajesh Govind \nJagesha v. State of Maharashtra</a> (<a href=\"/doc/1200711/\" id=\"a_22\">AIR 2000 \nSC 160) and State of H.P. v. Lekh Raj</a> (AIR \n1999 SC 3916), had not considered the \naforesaid three-Judge Bench decisions of this \nCourt. However, in our view, the ratio of the \naforesaid later decisions of this Court cannot \nbe said to be running counter to what is \ndecided by the earlier three-Judge Bench \njudgments on the facts and circumstances \nexamined by the Court while rendering these \ndecisions. But even assuming as submitted \nby learned Counsel for the appellants that the \nevidence of, these two injured witnesses i.e. \nBhogilal Ranchhodbhai and Karsanbhai \nVallabhbhai identifying the accused in the \nCourt may be treated to be of no assistance to \nthe prosecution, the fact remains that these \neye-witnesses were seriously injured and they \ncould have easily seen the faces of the \npersons assaulting them and their \nappearance and identity would well within \nimprinted in their minds especially when they \nwere assaulted in broad daylight. They could \nnot be said to be interested in roping in \ninnocent persons by shielding the real \naccused who had assaulted them.&quot;</span></span> \n</blockquote>                         \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1653286\" id=\"span_14\">20.\tThese aspects were highlighted in <a href=\"/doc/1653286/\" id=\"a_23\">Malkhansingh and \nOthers v.

Therefore, there was no difficulty in identifying \naccused Jalvir and naming him in the first information report.  \nIt is of significance that in the first information report name of \nJalvir was specifically noted.  The plea that Jalvir&#x27;s name \ncould not have been given at the first instance, because the \nwitness was unconscious is without any substance.

We find no infirmity in the \nconclusions of the High Court to warrant interference.  \nTherefore, Criminal Appeal no.1475 of 2007 stands dismissed \nand as noted above, Criminal Appeal no.932 of 2007 is \nallowed.    \n</p>","numcites":19,"numcitedby":67,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":1759478,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"test identification parade ","formInput":"test%20identification%20parade%20"},{"value":"arijit pasayat ","formInput":"arijit%20pasayat%20"},{"value":"identification of the accused ","formInput":"identification%20of%20the%20accused%20"},{"value":"identification parade","formInput":"identification%20parade"},{"value":"\"substantive evidence is\"","formInput":"%22substantive%20evidence%20is%22"},{"value":"substantive evidence","formInput":"substantive%20evidence"},{"value":"identification in court","formInput":"identification%20in%20court"},{"value":"maid","formInput":"maid"},{"value":"fatal","formInput":"fatal"},{"value":"IDENTIFYING WITNESS","formInput":"IDENTIFYING%20WITNESS"},{"value":"tip","formInput":"tip"},{"value":"328","formInput":"328"}],"cats":[{"value":"law-governing-evidence","formInput":"tag:law-governing-evidence"},{"value":"facts-explaining-or-introducing-relevant-facts","formInput":"tag:facts-explaining-or-introducing-relevant-facts"},{"value":"common-intention","formInput":"tag:common-intention"},{"value":"indian-penal-code","formInput":"tag:indian-penal-code"},{"value":"production-of-documents","formInput":"tag:production-of-documents"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
