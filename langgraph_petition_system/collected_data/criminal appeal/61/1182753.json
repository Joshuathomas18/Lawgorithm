It \n\n\n\nwas   further   revealed   that   Raj   Singh   had   also   sustained \n\n\n\ninjuries.     It   is   seen   from   the   X-ray   Report   (Ex.P5)   that   Raj \n\n\n\nSingh   had   fracture   of   femur   bone   and   according   to   Dr. \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                                         10</span>\n\n\f\nManmohan   Sharma   (PW-1),   the   injuries   were   serious   in \n\n\n\nnature.  He also opined that the injuries of Himmat Raj Singh \n\n\n\nand   Raghuraj   Singh   were   sufficient   to   cause   death   in   the \n\n\n\nordinary course of nature.   In his evidence, he also explained \n\n\n\nthat   the   death   of   Himmat   Raj   Singh   was   caused   due   to \n\n\n\nsepticemia shock as a result of multiple ante-mortem injuries \n\n\n\nto abdomen.  With reference to a suggestion, PW-1 had denied \n\n\n\nthat   blackening   and   tattooing   marks   can   be   possible   only \n\n\n\nwhen gun shots were fired  from a distance of  3  or 4 feet.   In \n\n\n\nrespect of the same, Dr. Sharma, (PW-1), explained in detail in \n\n\n\nhis cross-examination that the same marks are possible even \n\n\n\nin   the   case   of   gun   shots   which   are   fired   from   a   distance   of \n\n\n\nmore than 3 or 4 feet and it depends upon the nature of gun, \n\n\n\ngun powder, cartridges etc.  Raj Singh, (PW-2), in his evidence, \n\n\n\nhas stated that the accused Arjun Singh was standing on the \n\n\n\nroof of the house of Karan Singh and fired from muzzle loaded \n\n\n\ngun at Himmat Raj Singh.   Though there is little discrepancy \n\n\n\nas to the distance from the upper portion of the house and the \n\n\n\nactual   scene   of   occurrence,   it   cannot   be   concluded   that   the \n\n\n\ninjuries on Raghuraj Singh, Himmat Raj Singh and Raj Singh \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                                11</span>\n\n\f\nwere not caused by fire arms.   In this regard, it is relevant to \n\n\n\npoint   out   the   description   of   injuries   as   noted   by   Dr.   Sharma \n\n\n\n(PW-1)   in   Exs.   P1-P4   which   we   have   extracted   earlier.     In \n\n\n\naddition to the same, it is seen from the evidence of PW-1 that \n\n\n\nthe blackening marks found around the wounds and the dead \n\n\n\nbody confirmed that the deceased were within a distance of 6 \n\n\n\nfeet from the assailants when they received the injuries. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_30\">10)    Learned   senior   counsel   for   the   accused   persons \n\n\n\ncontended   that  in   the  absence   of  recovery   of  pellets  from   the \n\n\n\nscene of occurrence or from the body of the injured persons, it \n\n\n\nis  highly  doubtful as  to  the  scene  of  occurrence and  whether \n\n\n\nsuch  incident   did   take  place  in  the  manner   suggested   by  the \n\n\n\nprosecution.     Learned   counsel   appearing   for   the   complainant \n\n\n\npointed   out   that   though   there   was   an   entry   in   Malkhana \n\n\n\nRegister (Ex. P31A) wherein it was stated that a sealed packet \n\n\n\ncontaining pellets was deposited but prosecution failed to lead \n\n\n\nany   evidence   on   this   point.     It   was   also   pointed   out   that \n\n\n\nthough   a   report   was   received   from   the   Forensic   Science \n\n\n\nLaboratory,   no  evidence   regarding   recovery   of   the   pellets  was \n\n\n\nproduced.     As   rightly   pointed   out   by   the   learned   Additional \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                                             12</span>\n\n\f\nAdvocate   General   appearing   for   the   State   that   mere   non-\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">recovery of pistol or cartridge does not detract the case of the \n\n\n\nprosecution where clinching and direct evidence is acceptable. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">Likewise,   absence   of   evidence   regarding   recovery   of   used \n\n\n\npellets,   blood   stained   clothes   etc.   cannot   be   taken   or \n\n\n\nconstrued   as   no   such   occurrence   had   taken   place.     As   a \n\n\n\nmatter of fact, we have already pointed out that the gun shot \n\n\n\ninjuries   tallied   with   medical   evidence.     It   is   also   seen   that \n\n\n\nRaghuraj   Singh   and   Himmat   Raj   Singh,   who   had   died, \n\n\n\nreceived 8 and 7 gun shot wounds respectively while Raj Singh \n\n\n\n(PW-2) also received 8 gun shots scattered in front of left thigh. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">All these injuries have been noted by the Doctor (PW-1) in his \n\n\n\nreports Exs.

Similar conclusion arrived at by the \n\n\n\nHigh Court cannot be doubted.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                              13</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">12)    Coming to the contention relating to the motive, it is not \n\n\n\nin   dispute   that   Raghuraj   Singh   and   Himmat   Raj   Singh   died \n\n\n\ndue   to   gun   shot   injuries.     The   reliable   eye-witnesses   have \n\n\n\nstated   that   there   was   previous   enmity   between   them   and \n\n\n\nlitigation was going on between the accused-Karan Singh and \n\n\n\nthe complainant.  Even in the absence of motive, in view of the \n\n\n\nassertion   of   eye-witnesses,   particularly,   Raj   Singh,   (PW-2), \n\n\n\ncoupled with the medical evidence as seen from Exs. P1-P4, by \n\n\n\nthe   Doctor   (PW-1),   the   case   of   the   prosecution   cannot   be \n\n\n\nthrown out.  In a catena of decisions, this Court has held that \n\n\n\nmotive for doing a criminal act is generally a difficult area for \n\n\n\nthe   prosecution   to   prove   since   one   cannot   normally   be   seen \n\n\n\ninto the mind of another.   Motive is the emotion which impels \n\n\n\na man to do a particular act.   Even in the absence of specific \n\n\n\nevidence   as  to   motive,   in  view  of  the   fact  that  in   the   case  on \n\n\n\nhand, two persons have been killed and one sustained injuries \n\n\n\ndue to fire arms, the case of the prosecution cannot be thrown \n\n\n\nout on this ground.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">13)    Now,   let   us   consider   the   oral   evidence   led   in   by   the \n\n\n\nprosecution.     We   have   already   pointed   out   that   though   the \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                              14</span>\n\n\f\nprosecution   has   examined   as   many   as   30   witnesses,   they \n\n\n\nheavily relied only on 6 witnesses and out of these, Raj Singh \n\n\n\n(PW-2), Dhiraj Raj Singh (PW-3) and Brij Raj Singh (PW-4)  are \n\n\n\nbrothers,   Roop   Singh   (PW-6)   is   their   father   and   Durga \n\n\n\nShankar   (PW-5)   and   Satya   Narain   (PW-9)   were   working   as \n\n\n\nlabourers   in   the   house   of   Roop   Singh   at   the   time   of \n\n\n\noccurrence.   It is true that the names of PWs 3, 4 and 6 were \n\n\n\nnot   mentioned   either   in   parchabayan   (Ex.   P32)   or   in   the \n\n\n\nstatements, Exs. P22-23, recorded by the Judicial Magistrate, \n\n\n\n(PW-18) on the day of the occurrence.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">14)    It   was   also   pointed   out   that   all   the   eye-witnesses, \n\n\n\nparticularly, PWs 3, 4 and 6 being brothers and father of the \n\n\n\ndeceased, they  are interested  in their version and no reliance \n\n\n\nneed   to   be   placed   on   their   statements.     We   are   unable   to \n\n\n\naccept   the   said   contention.     This   Court,   in   a   series   of \n\n\n\ndecisions,   has   held   that   the   testimony   of   such   eye-witnesses \n\n\n\nshould not be rejected merely because witnesses are related to \n\n\n\nthe deceased.  This Court has held that their testimonies have \n\n\n\nto be carefully analysed because of their relationship and if the \n\n\n\nsame are cogent and if there is no discrepancy, the same are \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                                           15</span>\n\n\f\nacceptable vide  Abdul Rashid Abdul Rahiman Patel &amp; Ors. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">vs.  State   of   Maharashtra  (2007)   9  SCC   1.     Likewise,   minor \n\n\n\ndiscrepancies   in   the   evidence   of   eye-witnesses   are   also \n\n\n\nimmaterial.     However,   as   rightly   pointed   out,   if   Dhiraj   Raj \n\n\n\nSingh   (PW-3)   had   sustained   some   injuries,   his   name   could \n\n\n\nhave   been   mentioned   in   Exs.   P22,   P23   and   P32   which   were \n\n\n\nearliest versions.  In those documents, the names of Raghuraj \n\n\n\nSingh, who died on the same day and Himmat Raj Singh, who \n\n\n\ndied later and Raj Singh, who received gun shot injuries alone \n\n\n\nwere   mentioned   and   none   else.     Another   aspect,   as   rightly \n\n\n\npointed   out   is   that   when   the   injured   persons   were   examined \n\n\n\nby   the   Doctor   on   the   same   day,   admittedly,   PW-3   was \n\n\n\nexamined   only   on   the   fourth   day   of   the   incident   and   it   was \n\n\n\nseen that he did not receive any gun shot injury.  Considering \n\n\n\nall   these   aspects   including   the   fact   that   there   is   no   proof   of \n\n\n\nreceiving gun shot injury to PW-3 and also taking note of the \n\n\n\nfact that he was 13 years of age at the time of occurrence, as \n\n\n\nrightly   pointed   out   by   the   High   Court,   his   presence   itself   is \n\n\n\ndoubtful.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                                 16</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">15)    The   remaining   eye-witnesses,   as   per   the   prosecution \n\n\n\nversion, are PWs 2, 4 and 6.  It was demonstrated before us by \n\n\n\nthe learned  senior counsel for the accused  that the  names  of \n\n\n\nPWs 4 and 6 did not occur in parchabayan (Ex. P 32) as well \n\n\n\nas in the statements (Exs. P22 and P23) recorded by Shri Ajay \n\n\n\nKumar   Gupta,   (PW-18),   Judicial   Magistrate,   on   the   day   of \n\n\n\noccurence.     The   statement   in   Ex.  P32   was   recorded   at   11:40 \n\n\n\na.m. and the incident took place at about 09:30 a.m.  Though \n\n\n\nit was recorded within two hours, as rightly pointed out, while \n\n\n\nmentioning   the   details   of   the   occurrence,   names   of   the \n\n\n\nassailants,   eye-witnesses,   the   presence   of   Dhiraj   Raj   Singh \n\n\n\n(PW-3), Brij Raj Singh (PW-4) and Roop Singh (PW-6) was not \n\n\n\nmentioned.   We have already noted that even in Exs. P22-23, \n\n\n\nthe   names   of   PWs   3,   4   and   6   were   not   noted   and   no \n\n\n\nexplanation   has   been   offered   for   their   absence.             The \n\n\n\nverification   of   those   documents   clearly   show   that   only   the \n\n\n\nnames   of   Raghuraj   Singh   and   Himmat   Raj   Singh   (both   died \n\n\n\ndue   to   gun   shot   injuries)   and   Raj   Singh   (PW-2)   who   also \n\n\n\nreceived gun shot injuries were noted and except these names, \n\n\n\nnone else was noted.  Another important factor is that Himmat \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                          17</span>\n\n\f\nRaj   Singh,   Raghuraj   Singh   and   Raj   Singh   (PW-2)   alone   were \n\n\n\nmedically examined on the same day whereas Dhiraj Raj Singh \n\n\n\n(PW-3) was examined after 4 days of the incident and that too \n\n\n\nby the very same Doctor (PW-1).  There is no explanation at all \n\n\n\nfor   non-examination   of   PW-3   by   the   Doctor   along   with   other \n\n\n\ninjured witnesses.  In these circumstances, as rightly observed \n\n\n\nby the High Court, the presence of eye-witnesses, namely, PWs \n\n\n\n3, 4 and 6 at the place of occurrence on the date and time as \n\n\n\npleaded by the prosecution is highly doubtful.   We agree with \n\n\n\nthe said conclusion.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">16)    In   the   light   of   the   above   conclusion,   the   only   witness \n\n\n\navailable   to   support   the   case   of   the   prosecution   is   Raj   Singh \n\n\n\n(PW-2).   Let us consider his evidentiary value and how far he \n\n\n\nsupported   the   case   of   the   prosecution.     Mr.   Bajwa,   learned \n\n\n\nsenior   counsel   for   the   accused,   by   pointing   out   certain \n\n\n\ncontradictions,   submitted   that   it   is   not   safe   to   convict   the \n\n\n\naccused based on his evidence.  It is also pointed out that Raj \n\n\n\nSingh (PW-2) is highly interested witness and closely related to \n\n\n\neye-witnesses.   It was further pointed out that in the absence \n\n\n\nof any neighbour,  conviction based on the testimony  of PW-2 \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                              18</span>\n\n\f\nalone   is   not   sustainable.             In   the   light   of   the   above \n\n\n\nsubmissions, we have carefully scrutinized the evidence of PW-\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">2.

It was also held that merely because the prosecution has \n\n\n\nnot examined neighbours, it cannot be claimed that it is fatal \n\n\n\nto their case, when the evidence of eye-witnesses examined on \n\n\n\ntheir   side   is   found   to   be   acceptable   and   reliable.    Raj   Singh, \n\n\n\n(PW-2), in his evidence, in categorical terms has asserted that \n\n\n\nhe saw five to seven persons standing on the roof of the house \n\n\n\nof  Karan   Singh.     He   had   specifically   mentioned  the   names   of \n\n\n\nthose   persons   as   Bahadur   Singh,   Shivraj   Singh,   Banney \n\n\n\nSingh,   Smt   Swaroop   Bai,   Smt   Gyan   Kanwar,   Smt   Bhagwan \n\n\n\nKanwar,   Gajendra   Singh   and   Karan   Singh.     Inasmuch   as   in \n\n\n\nthe parchabayan (Ex. P32), only the name of Arjun Singh and \n\n\n\nas   per   Ex.   P22   the   names   of   Arjun   Singh   and   Banney   Singh \n\n\n\nwas  mentioned,  who  were  present  on  the  roof  at  the  relevant \n\n\n\ntime,   as  rightly   observed  by  the   High  Court,   the   claim   of  Raj \n\n\n\nSingh   (PW-2)   that   all   the   accused   persons   were   standing   on \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                                                  19</span>\n\n\f\nthe   roof   is   not   believable,   however,   his   assertion   that   two \n\n\n\npersons   Arjun   Singh   and   Banney   Singh   were   on   the   roof \n\n\n\ncannot be denied.   Even if we eschew certain portion from the \n\n\n\nevidence   of   PW-2,   his   assertion   and   the   statement   regarding \n\n\n\nthe   involvement   of   Arjun   Singh,   Shivraj   Singh   and   Banney \n\n\n\nSingh cannot be disputed.   In categorical terms, he explained \n\n\n\nthe role played by these persons.  It is clear from his evidence \n\n\n\nthat he received gun shot injuries which is also supported by \n\n\n\nmedical   evidence.     In   view   of   the   same,   his   presence   at   the \n\n\n\ntime   of   occurrence   cannot   be   disputed   and   is   found   to   be \n\n\n\nproved.     This   is   also   strengthened   from   his   statement   in \n\n\n\nparchabayan   (Ex.   P32)   and   Ex.   P22   statement   given   to \n\n\n\nJudicial   Magistrate   (PW-18).     A   perusal   of   Ex.   P32   makes   it \n\n\n\nclear   that   it   was   Arjun   Singh   who   first   fired   a   gun   shot   at \n\n\n\nHimmat  Raj Singh  and subsequently  Bheem Singh, Gajendra \n\n\n\nSingh (both absconding) Banney Singh and Shivraj Singh also \n\n\n\nfired at Raghuraj Singh and Raj Singh causing injury to them. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">Ex. P32 also clearly shows that there are specific allegations of \n\n\n\ncausing  gun  shot   injuries  against   Shivraj  Singh,  Arjun   Singh \n\n\n\nand   Banney   Singh.     In   the   same   manner,   verification   of   Ex. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                                20</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">P22   shows   that   Arjun   Singh   and   Banney   Singh   fired   at   the \n\n\n\ndeceased Himmat Raj Singh and, thereafter, Bheem Singh and \n\n\n\nShivraj Singh fired at the brothers of Himmat Raj Singh when \n\n\n\nthey   were   going   to   inform   the   police.     Though   Mr.   Bajwa \n\n\n\npointed   out   certain   discrepancies   as   to   the   number   of   gun \n\n\n\nshots, in view of the number of injuries, as seen from Exs.

Considering the medical evidence that \n\n\n\nHimmat   Raj   Singh   sustained   7   gun   shot   injuries   which   were \n\n\n\nsufficient   to   cause   death   in   the   ordinary   course,   we   are \n\n\n\nsatisfied that the death of Himmat Raj Singh undoubtedly falls \n\n\n\nwithin the ambit of 302 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_46\">IPC</a>.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                          21</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">18)    The materials placed by the prosecution clearly prove the \n\n\n\nguilt   against   the   three   convicted   accused,   namely,   Shivraj \n\n\n\nSingh,   Arjun   Singh   and   Banney   Singh   who   were   armed   with \n\n\n\nguns   and   with   their   common   intention   they   fired   gun   shots \n\n\n\nresulting in death of Raghuraj Singh and Himmat Raj Singh as \n\n\n\nwell   as   causing   injuries   to   Raj   Singh   (PW-2),   in   such \n\n\n\ncircumstances,   their   conviction   and   sentence   by   both   the \n\n\n\ncourts have to be confirmed.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">19)    Dr.   Manish   Singhvi   vehemently   argued   as   to   the   role   of \n\n\n\nthe acquitted accused.
