The second question for consideration before this Court is as to whether Special Judge can treat the application under <a href=\"/doc/99487/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 156(3)</a> Cr.P.C. as a complaint case or not.&quot; \n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">3.\t\tThe answer given to the second question is in para-18 of the said judgement which is as follows:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">&quot;18.    ....

Thus, this Court differs with the view taken in the case of Soni Devi (Supra) in its second question as decided as to whether it is correct ?&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">5.\t \tThe petitions are in which applications filed under <a href=\"/doc/99487/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 156 (3)</a> Cr.P.C. have been treated as a complaint and the accused persons therein have been summoned to face trial. The accused persons thus are before this Court challenging the validity and legality of the orders passed against them.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_6\">6.\t\tSri Arvind Kumar Singh, learned counsel appearing in the main petition has argued that as per the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/25085007/\" id=\"a_5\">Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989</a> (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Act&quot;) lodging of a first information report is mandatory if an act has been complained of, which is an offence. He argued that since the Act is a <a href=\"/doc/701797/\" id=\"a_6\">Special Act</a>, the same overrides any other Act. The Special Court designated under the Act cannot take cognizance of an offence on itself by treating an application under <a href=\"/doc/99487/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 156 (3)</a> Cr.P.C. as a complaint. Even Rule 12 of the Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes (Prevention of Atrocities) Rules, 1995 (hereinafter referred to as &quot;the Rules&quot;) and Schedule (1) of the Rules provide for payment of compensation to the victim at different stages, starting from lodging of the first information report. It does not makes any provision for payment of  compensation in the event the offence as complained of is treated as a complaint case.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">7.\t\tSri Geetam Singh, learned counsel appearing in Criminal Appeal No. 4141 of 2022 while referring to Rule 7 of the Rules argued that the same only provides for investigation without any option of enquiry. He further places Rule 8 (via) and (vii) of the Rules and argues that the same also refers to the proceedings of investigation only. He also argued that if the court takes cognizance directly on an application moved under <a href=\"/doc/99487/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 156 (3)</a> Cr.P.C., the benefit of Rule 12 and Schedule (1) of the Rules will not be extended to the victim unless appropriate compensation is directed to be given. It is argued that as such the scheme and the intention of the legislation is only for lodging of a first information report for offences under the Act and not any other remedy.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">8.\t\tSri Prateek J. Nagar, learned counsel appearing in Criminal Appeal No. 5974 of 2021 argued that the Act is silent with regards to process, procedure and filing of a complaint and refers to first information report only at every place. He states that as such lodging of the first information report is mandatory and complaint is not maintainable.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">9. \t\tPer contra, Sri Syed Ali Murtaza and Sri Ankit Srivastava, learned counsels for the State appearing in all the matters argued that the inception of a criminal case is on the basis of a first information report or a complaint. It is argued that <a href=\"/doc/101389/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 4(2)(b)</a> of the Act provides for duties of a public servant, which shall include to register a complaint or a first information report under this Act and other relevant provisions and to register it under appropriate Sections of this Act. It is argued that a public servant is defined under <a href=\"/doc/678464/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 2 (bg)</a> of the Act, which includes persons as defined under <a href=\"/doc/1052367/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 21</a> of the Indian Penal Code (45 of 1860) and thus as per third clause of <a href=\"/doc/1052367/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 21</a> I.P.C. a Judge is a public servant.  Thus looking at the provision of <a href=\"/doc/101389/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 4(2)(b)</a> of the Act it is argued that a public servant is under a duty to take cognizance on a complaint or register a first information report under this Act and other relevant provisions as the case may be, thus filing of a complaint and/or treating an application under <a href=\"/doc/99487/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 156 (3)</a> Cr.P.C. as a complaint is not barred. It is further argued that even the second proviso of <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 14</a> of the Act gives power to the Special Court or Exclusive Special Court so established or specified to directly take cognizance of offences under this Act and as such even taking cognizance under the Act is not prohibited but is expressly provided.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">10. \t\tHeard Mr.  Arvind Kumar Singh, Mohd Zaid, Mr. Prateek J.

Second proviso to Section 14 of the Atrocities Act which has been inserted by Act 1 of 2016 w.e.f. 26.1.2016 confers power upon the Special Court so established or specified for the purpose of providing for speedy trial also shall have the power to directly take cognizance of the offences under the Atrocities Act.

Merely because, learned Magistrate has taken cognizance of the offences and thereafter the trial / case has been committed to Special Court established for the purpose of providing for speedy trial, it cannot be said that entire criminal proceedings including FIR and charge-sheet etc. are vitiated and on the aforesaid ground entire criminal proceedings for the offences under <a href=\"/doc/838469/\" id=\"a_27\">Sections 452</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_28\">323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1133601/\" id=\"a_29\">325</a>, <a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_30\">504</a>, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_31\">506(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/112749/\" id=\"a_32\">114</a> of the Indian Penal Code and under Section 3(1)(x) of the Atrocities Act are to be quashed and set aside.

But at the same time, as observed herein above, merely on the ground that cognizance of the offences under the Atrocities Act is not taken directly by the Special Court constituted under Section 14 of the Atrocities Act, the entire criminal proceedings cannot be said to have been vitiated and cannot be quashed and set aside solely on the ground that cognizance has been taken by the learned Magistrate after insertion of second proviso to Section 14 which confers powers upon the Special Court also to directly take cognizance of the offences under the Atrocities Act and thereafter case is committed to the Special Court/Court of Session.&quot; \t\t\t\t\t  (emphasis supplied)\n \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">14.\t\tThe same thus makes it clear that a special court or courts specified can take cognizance directly.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"190417046\" id=\"span_2\">15.\t\tThe said judgement has been relied upon by the Apex Court subsequently in the case of <a href=\"/doc/190417046/\" id=\"a_33\">Ramveer Upadhyay and another vs. State of U.P. and another</a> 3 and the argument of learned counsel in the said case was that the Additional District and Sessions Judge had no jurisdiction to take cognizance or issue summons or orders, has been held that it cannot be sustained.
