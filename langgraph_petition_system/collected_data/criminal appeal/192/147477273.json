In such a situation the disguised protagonist never puts a\n\nHamletian question - “to be or not to be” – but marches ahead with\n\nperverted proclivity – sans concern, sans care for collective interest,\n\nand irrefragably without conscience. In a way, corruption becomes a\n\nnational economic terror. This social calamity warrants a different\n\ncontrol and hence, the legislature comes up with special legislation\n\nwith stringent provisions.    The law having been enacted, there is a\n\nchallenge to the constitutionality of the provisions. That is the subject\n\nmatter of these appeals, for the judgments rendered by the High\n\nCourts of Orissa and Patna are under assail herein.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">2.

In this batch of appeals, by special leave, we are called upon to\n\ndeal with the legal substantiality of the judgments rendered by the\n\nHigh Court of Judicature of Orissa at Cuttack and the High Court of\n\nJudicature at Patna upholding the constitutional validity of the <a href=\"/doc/113789479/\" id=\"a_1\">Orissa\n\nSpecial Courts Act, 2006</a> (for brevity, “the Orissa Act”) which has been\n\nassented to by the President of India on 19.9.2007 and published in\n\nExtraordinary Orissa Gazette on 15.10.2007; and the Bihar Special\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                      2</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/14059367/\" id=\"a_2\">Courts Act, 2009</a> (for short, “the Bihar Act”), respectively. We are also\n\nrequired to consider the validity of an aspect of Bihar Special Court\n\nRules, 2010 (for short, “the 2010 Rules”). May it be stated though the\n\nHigh Court has noted the same and made certain observations yet has\n\nnot proceeded to deal with the validity of the Rule in question.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">4.    As the factual matrix in all the cases has a common backdrop,\n\nwe shall refer to the facts in brief.     In all the cases, the appellants\n\nare/were public servants and facing criminal cases for various\n\noffences including the offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_3\">Prevention of Corruption Act,\n\n1988</a> (for short, ‘the 1988 Act’), particularly <a href=\"/doc/6350632/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the\n\n1988 Act on the allegation that they were having                   property\n\ndisproportionate to their known sources of income. The grievance of\n\nappellants in these appeals relate to the impact and effect of the\n\nlegislations brought during the pendency of the proceedings.             That\n\napart, the constitutional validity of the number of provisions of the two\n\nenactments has been assailed on many a ground which are not\n\nrestricted to the pending trials alone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">5.    At the outset, we may state that the provisions in both the Acts\n\nare   almost   similar   and,   therefore,   we   shall   dwell   upon    the\n\nconstitutionality of the Orissa Act first and in course of our\n\ndelineation, we shall refer to the Bihar Act wherever it is necessary.\n\nHence, we proceed to deal with the Orissa Act. The State legislature\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                     3</span>\n\fkeeping   in   view   the   accumulation     of   extensive   properties\n\ndisproportionate to the known sources of income by persons who had\n\nheld or are holding high political and public offices, thought it\n\nappropriate to provide special courts for speedy trial for certain class\n\nof offences and for confiscation of properties involved; and accordingly,\n\nenacted the Orissa Act which was passed by the Orissa Legislative\n\nAssembly that got the assent of the President of India. The State\n\nGovernment in exercise of its power conferred under Section 27 of the\n\nOrissa Act framed a set of Rules, namely, the Orissa Special Courts\n\nRules, 2007 (for short “2007 Rules”).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">6.   Before we dwell upon the submissions that were raised before the\n\nHigh Court and how the High Court has dealt with them, we think it\n\nappropriate to understand the scheme of the Orissa Act. Section 2(a)\n\nof the Orissa Act defines “authorised officer” which means any serving\n\nofficer belonging to Orissa Superior Judicial Service (Senior Branch)\n\nand who is or has been an Additional Sessions Judge, nominated by\n\nthe State Government with the concurrence of the High Court for the\n\npurpose of <a href=\"/doc/137316203/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 13</a>. <a href=\"/doc/136814978/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 2(c)</a> defines “declaration” in relation to\n\nan offence and it means a declaration made under <a href=\"/doc/158012332/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 5</a> in respect\n\nof such offences. The term “offence” has been defined under <a href=\"/doc/18890150/\" id=\"a_8\">Section\n\n2(d)</a> which means an offence of criminal misconduct within the\n\nmeaning of clause (e) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/137316203/\" id=\"a_9\">section 13</a> of the 1988 Act.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                    4</span>\n\fAs per dictionary clause, <a href=\"/doc/79424084/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 2(e)</a> specifies “Special Court” which\n\nmeans a Special Court would be one as provided under Section 3 of\n\nthe Orissa Act. <a href=\"/doc/43216602/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 2(f)</a> provides that words and expressions used\n\nherein and not defined but defined in the Code shall have the same\n\nmeanings respectively assigned to them in the Code.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">7.   Section 3 of the Orissa Act deals with establishment of Special\n\nCourts. <a href=\"/doc/110182839/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 4</a> enables the Special Court to take cognizance and\n\ntry such cases as are instituted before it or transferred to it under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/108834713/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 10</a>. <a href=\"/doc/71063033/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 7</a> deals with the jurisdiction of Special Courts as\n\nto trial of offences.   It lays down that Special Court shall have\n\njurisdiction to try any person alleged to have committed the offence in\n\nrespect of which a declaration has been made under <a href=\"/doc/158012332/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 5</a>, either\n\nas the principal, or as a conspirator or abettor and for all the other\n\noffences, and the accused persons can jointly be tried therewith at one\n\ntrial in accordance with the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_16\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1973 (“the\n\nCode” for short). <a href=\"/doc/58532583/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 8</a> deals with the procedure and powers of the\n\nSpecial Courts. Sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/58532583/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 8</a> lays the postulate that\n\nsave as expressly provided in the Act, the provisions of the Code and\n\nof the 1988 Act shall, in so far as they are not inconsistent with the\n\nprovisions of the Orissa Act, apply to the proceedings before a Special\n\nCourt and for the purpose of the said provisions, the person\n\nconducting a prosecution before a special court shall be deemed to be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                   5</span>\n\fa Public Prosecutor.   <a href=\"/doc/96749549/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 9</a> provides for an appeal to the High\n\nCourt of Orissa from any judgment and sentence. <a href=\"/doc/108834713/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 10</a> confers\n\nthe power on the High Court of Orissa to transfer cases from one\n\nSpecial Court to another.     <a href=\"/doc/164254444/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 11(1)</a> expressing the legislative\n\ncommand lays down that the special courts shall not adjourn any trial\n\nfor any purpose unless such adjournment is, in its opinion, necessary\n\nin the interest of justice and for reasons to be recorded in writing and\n\nsub-Section (2) of said Section provides that the Special Court shall\n\nendeavour to dispose of the trial of the case within a period of one year\n\nfrom the date of its institution or transfer, as the case may be. <a href=\"/doc/104963428/\" id=\"a_22\">Section\n\n12</a> enables the Special Judge presiding over a Special Court on the\n\nevidence recorded by his predecessor or predecessors or partly\n\nrecorded by his predecessor or predecessors and partly recorded by\n\nhimself. <a href=\"/doc/137316203/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 13</a> provides for filing of application for confiscation\n\nbefore the Authorised Officer. It empowers the State Government to\n\nauthorise the Public Prosecutor to make an application and also\n\nstipulates what the application shall accompany.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">8.   <a href=\"/doc/158670869/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 14</a> provides for issuance of show cause notice by the\n\nAuthorised Officer to the person concerned to explain his source of\n\nincome and other assets and why such money or property or both\n\nshould not be declared to have been acquired by means of the offence\n\nand be confiscated to the State Government. Sub-section (2) provides\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                    6</span>\n\fthat where a notice under sub-section (1) to any person specifies any\n\nmoney or property or both has been held on behalf of such person by\n\nany other person, a copy of the notice shall also be served upon such\n\nother person. Sub-section (3) lays down that the evidence, information\n\nor particulars brought on record before the authorised officer shall not\n\nbe used against the accused in the trial before the special court.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/115380359/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 15</a> deals with the confiscation of property in certain cases. It\n\nprovides a detailed procedure and obliges the authorised officer to\n\nfollow the principles of natural justice. It prescribes a time limit for\n\ndisposal of the proceeding and gives immense stress on identification\n\nof property or money or both which have been acquired by means of\n\nthe offence and further it makes the confiscation subject to the order\n\npassed in appeal under Section 17 of the Orissa Act. It may be noted\n\nhere that the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/38138337/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 15(3)</a> stipulates that the market price\n\nof the property confiscated, if deposited with the Authorised Officer,\n\nthe property shall not be confiscated. <a href=\"/doc/136860904/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 16</a> lays down that after\n\nthe issue of notice under <a href=\"/doc/158670869/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 14</a>, any money or property or both\n\nreferred to in the said notice are transferred by any mode whatsoever,\n\nsuch transfer shall for the purposes of the proceedings under the\n\nOrissa Act, be void and if such money or property or both are\n\nsubsequently confiscated to the State Government under <a href=\"/doc/115380359/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 15</a>,\n\nthen the transfer of such money or property or both shall be deemed\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                   7</span>\n\fto be null and void. <a href=\"/doc/87595771/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 17(1)</a> enables the aggrieved person by the\n\norder passed by an authorised officer to prefer an appeal within thirty\n\ndays from the date on which the order appealed against was passed.\n\nSub-section (2) provides that upon appeal being preferred under the\n\nsaid provision, the High Court may, after giving such parties, as it\n\nthinks proper, an opportunity of being heard, pass such order as it\n\nthinks fit; sub-section (3) requires the High Court to dispose of the\n\nappeal within three months from the date it is preferred and stay\n\norder, if any, passed in appeal shall not remain in force beyond the\n\nperiod prescribed for disposal of appeal. Sub-section (1) of Section 18\n\nof the Orissa Act empowers the State Government to take possession.\n\nIt stipulates that where any money or property has been confiscated to\n\nthe State Government under the Act, the concerned authorised officer\n\nshall order the person affected as well as any other person who may be\n\nin possession of the money or property or both, to surrender or deliver\n\npossession thereof to the concerned authorised officer or to any person\n\nduly authorised by in this behalf, within thirty days of the service of\n\nthe order.   The proviso to the said sub-section stipulates that the\n\nauthorised officer, on an application being made in that behalf and\n\nbeing satisfied that the person affected is residing in the property in\n\nquestion, may instead of dispossessing him immediately from the\n\nsame, permit such person to occupy it for a limited period to be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                   8</span>\n\fspecified on payment of market rent to the State Government and\n\nthereafter, such person shall deliver the vacant possession of the\n\nproperty. Sub-section (2) provides that if any person refuses or fails to\n\ncomply with an order made under sub-section (1), the authorised\n\nofficer may take possession of the property and may, for that purpose,\n\nuse such force as may be necessary.      Sub-section (3) confers powers\n\non the authorised officer to requisition service of any police officer to\n\nassist and mandates the concerned police officer to comply with such\n\nrequisition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">9.   Chapter IV of the Orissa Act deals with the miscellaneous\n\nprovisions. <a href=\"/doc/80801957/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 20</a> stipulates that no notice issued or served, no\n\ndeclaration made and no order passed under the Act shall be deemed\n\nto be invalid by reason of any error in the description of the property\n\nor person mentioned therein, if such property or person is identifiable\n\nfrom the description so mentioned.       <a href=\"/doc/17554113/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 21</a> provides that the\n\nprovisions of the Orissa Act shall be in addition, and not in derogation\n\nof, any other law for the time being in force. It also lays down that\n\nnothing contained in the Act shall exempt any public servant from a\n\nproceeding, apart from this Act, be instituted against him. <a href=\"/doc/198765943/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 22</a>\n\nsays save as provided in <a href=\"/doc/96749549/\" id=\"a_34\">Sections 9</a> and <a href=\"/doc/145282532/\" id=\"a_35\">17</a> and notwithstanding\n\nanything contained in any of the law, no suit or any other legal\n\nproceeding shall be maintainable in any Court in respect of money or\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                    9</span>\n\fproperty or both ordered to be confiscated under <a href=\"/doc/115380359/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 15</a>. <a href=\"/doc/148634879/\" id=\"a_37\">Section\n\n23</a> grants protection to the person in respect of any action done in\n\ngood faith or intended to be done in pursuance of the Orissa Act.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/52168947/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 24</a> empowers the State Government to make rules as it may\n\ndeem necessary for carrying out the purposes of the Orissa Act.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/88925416/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 26</a>, an overriding provision, provides that notwithstanding\n\nanything in the 1988 Act and the Criminal Law Amendment\n\nOrdinance, 1944 or any other law for the time being in force, the\n\nprovisions of the said Act shall prevail in case of any inconsistency.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">10. Having enumerated the scheme of the Orissa Act, we think it\n\nappropriate to refer to certain definitions under the 2007 Rules framed\n\nunder the Orissa Act. Rule 2(e) and (f) define “person holding high\n\npublic office” and “person holding high political office”, respectively.\n\nThe said definitions read as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     “2(e) “person holding high public office” includes a public\n     servant falling within the meaning of clause (c) of <a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 2</a>\n     of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 or under <a href=\"/doc/1052367/\" id=\"a_41\">Section\n     21</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and belonging to Group-A\n     service of the Central or State Government or officers of\n     equivalent rank in any organization specified in the\n     explanation below clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 2</a> of the said Act who\n     was serving under or in connection with the affairs of the\n     State Government;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">     (f) “Person holding high political office” includes-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">     (i) members of the Council of Ministers and the Chief\n     Minster;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                    10</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">\f     (ii) any person falling under the definition of public servant\n     under clause (c) of <a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 2</a> of the Prevention of Corruption\n     Act, 1988 or under <a href=\"/doc/1052367/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 21</a> of the Indian Penal Code,\n     1860 who has been appointed to discharge the executive\n     functions of the State in any organization specified in the\n     explanation below clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/62140/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 2</a> of the said Act and\n     receiving pay or honorarium or allowances for the services\n     so rendered.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">11.

Be it stated after judgment was delivered by the High Court on\n\n16.9.2010, the State Government, Department of Home brought out a\n\nnotification on 27.11.2010 amending certain rules. The relevant rule\n\nwhich has been amended is as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     “2.

The constitutional validity of the Act as well as the Rules (prior to\n\nthe amendment of the Rule) was assailed before the High Court in\n\nmany a writ petition.

The sixth question related to a writ\n\npetitioner who was an IAS officer and it was asserted that he belonged\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                      11</span>\n\fto a category other than the officer of Group A service and hence, the\n\ndeclaration bringing him under the Act was illegal.       Thus, the said\n\nissue stands on a different footing and we shall in due course deal\n\nwith the said challenge but the five questions posed by the High Court\n\nare enumerated herein:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       “(1) Whether the similar provisions in the present impugned\n       Act is required to be re-examined in these writ petitions with\n       reference to either the definition clause or declaration under\n       <a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_47\">section 5(1)</a> and other provisions of Chapter III of the\n       impugned Act in view of the decision rendered by this Court\n       in Kishore Chandra Patel’s case (supra) wherein the\n       provisions of <a href=\"/doc/616856/\" id=\"a_48\">section 5</a> and other similar provisions of the\n       impugned Act and Chapter III (Confiscation) have already\n       been held to be constitutional, legal and valid as the same\n       do not offend <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_49\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_50\">21</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       (2) Whether the impugned Act is repugnant or inconsistent\n       with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_51\">Prevention of Corruption Act</a> and\n       other Central Acts to the impugned <a href=\"/doc/701797/\" id=\"a_52\">Special Courts Act,\n       2006</a>?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       (3) Whether the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/113789479/\" id=\"a_53\">Orissa Special Courts Act,\n       2006</a> are repugnant to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_54\">Prevention of\n       Money Laundering Act</a> as amended by <a href=\"/doc/2077/\" id=\"a_55\">Amendment Act,\n       2009</a>?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">       (4) Whether the impugned notification issued under <a href=\"/doc/1229833/\" id=\"a_56\">section\n       5(1)</a> of the Act is liable to be quashed?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       (5) Whether introducing the bill as Money Bill is legal and\n       valid?”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8212\" id=\"span_17\">14. After posing the said questions, the High Court dealt with\n\nquestion nos. 1 and 4 together and referred to the decision in <a href=\"/doc/8212/\" id=\"a_57\">Kishore\n\nChandra Patel v. State of Orissa1</a>, and observed that in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">1</span>\n    1993 (76) CLT 720\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                    12</span>\n\faforesaid judgment, the constitutional validity of Part III regarding\n\nconfiscation of monies and properties of the accused persons, who\n\nwere facing the criminal trial in the Special Court constituted under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/113789479/\" id=\"a_58\">Orissa Special Courts Act, 1990</a> by the State Government for\n\nspeedy disposal, was held to be legal and valid and did not violate any\n\nof the fundamental rights and were not inconsistent with the statutory\n\nrights conferred either under the Code or the <a href=\"/doc/1732853/\" id=\"a_59\">Criminal Law\n\nAmendment Act</a> or Civil Procedure Code. The High Court also took\n\nnote of the fact that the earlier Division Bench had issued certain\n\ndirections and an ordinance was brought in to cure the flaws and the\n\nCourt had ultimately found that the amended Act was constitutional.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">Keeping the same in view, the Division Bench by the impugned order\n\nopined that <a href=\"/doc/616856/\" id=\"a_60\">section 5</a> of the Act is constitutional. The High Court also\n\ntook note of an affidavit filed on 23.7.2010 and on that basis ruled\n\nthat the apprehension that certain cases would be selectively picked\n\nand chosen from amongst the offenders charged under <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 13(1)(e)</a>\n\nof the 1988 Act for the purposes of invoking the provision of Chapter\n\nIII was untenable in law. After making reference to the authority in\n\nDelhi Administration v. V.C. Shukla2, the Court opined that the\n\nattack based on discrimination was unfounded and accordingly\n\nanswered the question nos. 1 and 4 against the writ petitioners. While\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">2</span>\n    (1980) Supp. SCC 249\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                  13</span>\n\fdealing with the question no. 3 which pertained to the repugnancy of\n\nthe Orissa Act to the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_62\">Prevention of Money Laundering\n\nAct, 2002</a> as amended by Amendment Act 2009, it has been opined\n\nthat there was no repugnancy between the two statutes, for the\n\nprocedure under both the statutes relating to confiscation of monies\n\nand properties of the accused are different and further the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_63\">Prevention\n\nof Money Laundering Act, 2002</a> does not efface the prosecution\n\nagainst the persons facing prosecutions under the 1988 Act.

Having stated how the Division Bench of the High Court of Orissa\n\nhas dealt with the constitutional validity of the Orissa Act, we think it\n\napt and definitely for the sake of convenience, to refer to the Bihar Act,\n\nchallenges before the High Court and the judgment rendered by the\n\nHigh Court of Judicature at Patna. The Bihar Act was notified in the\n\nGazette on 8.2.2010. <a href=\"/doc/564136/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 2</a> of the dictionary clause defines the\n\nAct, that is, the 1988 Act, Authorised Officer, Declaration and\n\nOffences. <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 3</a> deals with establishment of Special Courts.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1182345/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 4</a> provides for taking cognizance of cases by Special Courts.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1318379/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 7</a> provides the jurisdiction of the Special Courts for trial of\n\noffence. <a href=\"/doc/449543/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 8</a> stipulates the procedure and powers of the Special\n\nCourts. <a href=\"/doc/1080526/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 9</a> provides for an appeal against the judgment and\n\nsentence to the High Court. <a href=\"/doc/64392/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 10</a> deals with transfer of cases.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1988748/\" id=\"a_87\">Sections 11</a> and <a href=\"/doc/290623/\" id=\"a_88\">12</a> deal with the role of the presiding Judge. Chapter\n\nIII of the Bihar Act deals with confiscation of property. <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_89\">Sections 13</a> to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/449543/\" id=\"a_90\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">8</span></a>\n    AIR (1969) SC 903\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">9</span>\n    AIR (1961) SC 954\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                   15</span>\n\f16 are similar to the Orissa Act. <a href=\"/doc/505579/\" id=\"a_91\">Section 18</a> empowers the authorized\n\nofficer to take possession. The proviso appended there is similar to the\n\nOrissa Act.   <a href=\"/doc/1093594/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 19</a> deals with refund of confiscated money or\n\nproperty. Chapter IV of the Bihar Act enumerates the miscellaneous\n\nprovisions and <a href=\"/doc/1155491/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 26</a>, like the Orissa Act states as regards the\n\noverriding effect.   The competent authority has framed a set of rules,\n\nnamely, Bihar Special Courts Rules 2010, for short, “2010 Rules”.\n\nRule 2(f) of the 2010 Rules defines “public servant” to mean a public\n\nservant as defined within the meaning of clause (c) of <a href=\"/doc/564136/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 2</a> of the\n\n1988 Act or under <a href=\"/doc/1052367/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 21</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 and\n\nincluding Group – A service of the Central or State Government or\n\nofficers of equivalent rank in any organization specified in the\n\nexplanation below clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/564136/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 2</a> of the said Act who was\n\nserving under or in connection with the affairs of the State\n\nGovernment. Rule 6 deals with cognizance and trial by the Special\n\nCourt.   Rule 9 states that the State Government, in consultation with\n\nthe High Court shall nominate an officer belonging to the cadre of the\n\nBihar Superior Judicial Service, Senior Branch, who is or has been a\n\nSessions Judge or Additional Sessions Judge to act as the authorized\n\nofficer for the purposes of the Act and requires him to follow the\n\nsummary procedure. Rule 13 deals with the application of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_97\">CrPC</a> and\n\nit stipulates that the provisions of the Code shall apply to the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                   16</span>\n\fproceedings before the authorised officer insofar as they are not\n\ninconsistent with the provisions of the Act.      Rule 14 provides for\n\nparticulars of an application made before the Authorised Officer and\n\nForm of Notice.     The said Rule provides the particulars to be\n\nmentioned while filing an application under <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 13</a> of the Act\n\nwhich requires a range of information to be furnished.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">16. Presently, we shall refer to the judgment rendered by the Division\n\nBench of the High Court of Patna. It has referred to the preamble and\n\nhighlighted certain aspects of the preamble and scanned the anatomy\n\nof the Bihar Act.   It was contended before the High Court that the\n\ndeclaration made under <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 5</a> which brings the case of the\n\naccused under the purview of the Bihar Act to be tried by the Special\n\nJudge, exposes him to the risk of confiscation of property which the\n\naccused does not face under the 1988 Act; that when there are\n\nsufficient provisions in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_100\">CrPC</a> pertaining to disposal of property at\n\nconclusion of the trial under Section 452, there was no justification or\n\nwarrant to introduce a provision for confiscation; that no guidelines\n\nhave been provided by the legislature for working of <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_101\">Section 5(1)</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1353213/\" id=\"a_102\">5(2)</a> of the 2009 Act and it is completely unguided giving total\n\ndiscretion to the State Government to pick and choose any particular\n\ncase; that <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 5(1)</a> suffers from unreasonable classification\n\nbecause certain offences covered under the 1988 Act would be tried by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                  17</span>\n\fthe Special Judge under the 1988 Act and offence defined under the\n\nBihar Act would be tried according to the procedure which is more\n\nrigorous; that the necessity of speedy trial by itself is too vague to\n\nwithstand the test of reasonable classification; that there is no\n\nintelligible differentia which can sustain the classification and hence, it\n\nis hostile, discriminatory and contrary to the basic tenet of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 14</a>\n\nof the Constitution; that there has been excessive and unguided\n\ndelegation of power to the executive and, therefore, the manner of\n\nclassification to be undertaken is contrary to the constitutional\n\nscheme.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">17. Resisting the aforesaid submissions, it was urged on behalf of the\n\nState that the 2009 Act was brought into existence regard being had to\n\nthe rampant corruption and disproportionate assets amassed by the\n\npublic servants through illegal means; that it is the obligation of the\n\nState to prosecute such persons and confiscate their ill-gotten assets;\n\nthat <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 5(1)</a> does not suffer from vice of discrimination and it\n\nwithstands the test of discernible differentia and there has been no\n\nabdication of legislative function or conferment of unguided delegation\n\nof power; that making a provision for speedy trial is a facet of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_106\">Article\n\n21</a> of the Constitution and in the obtaining scenario to eradicate the\n\nmaladies and the menace, the legislature had enacted the legislation\n\nto deal with it frontally; that the power vested under <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 5</a> has\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                    18</span>\n\fenough guidance and it cannot be said that it falls foul of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 14</a> of\n\nthe Constitution; that from the very definition of the term “offence” it\n\nis clear that it is in a different category or compartment altogether;\n\nthat the non-assail of the declaration before any court would not\n\ninclude the High Court or the Supreme Court of India which exercises\n\npower of judicial review; that the challenge to <a href=\"/doc/1187846/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 6(2)</a> of the Act\n\ntakes in its sweep the pending cases whereby making the provision\n\neffective; that it neither offends <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 20(1)</a> nor <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 20(3)</a> of the\n\nConstitution, for the plea that accused persons would be exposed to\n\nharsher punishment relating to confiscation which is a greater penalty\n\nthat was prescribed for the offence under the 1988 Act, is\n\nunsustainable inasmuch as the Act does not alter the punishment for\n\nthe offence as provided under the 1988 Act and, in any case, the\n\nconfiscation proceeding is an independent proceeding to be conducted\n\nby the authorized officer and it cannot be treated as a part of the\n\ncriminal proceeding; that the procedure prescribed for adjudication of\n\nthe issues relating to confiscation of properties does not suffer from\n\nany arbitrariness inasmuch as the confiscation including taking over\n\npossession of the confiscated property is independent and the plea\n\nthat the findings recorded by the authorized officer in every likelihood\n\nto   cause   prejudice   and   bias    during   the   trial,   is   absolutely\n\nunsustainable inasmuch as the statute itself provides the exclusion of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                      19</span>\n\fconsideration of the said material and the findings during the trial.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">18. Adverting to the rivalised submissions, the High Court opined\n\nthat the nature of property sought to be confiscated under the Act is\n\ndifferent and, therefore, the assail has no substance; that the\n\nprovision in <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 13</a> of the Act and related provisions in Chapter–III\n\ncannot be faulted on account of ordinary principles of criminal\n\njurisprudence that penalty or punishment must follow determination\n\nof guilt of the accused for confiscation, a pro tem one, is of a different\n\nnature; that the Act guarantees fairness to the accused by making the\n\norder of confiscation subject to an appeal before the High Court as\n\nwell as subject to the final determination of guilt of the accused in the\n\ntrial; that the general criticism that the procedure for confiscation\n\ninvites the wrath of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution does not deserve\n\nacceptance; and that the proceeding for confiscation is to be\n\nadjudicated by the Authorized Officer who has to be a Sessions Judge\n\nor Additional Sessions Judge and hence, there is fair and adequate\n\nprotection provided for considering the case of the delinquent before\n\npassing an order of confiscation. Adverting to the likelihood of bias,\n\nthe High Court opined that a trained judicial mind of a person holding\n\npost of Sessions Judge/Additional Sessions Judge is not expected to\n\nsuffer from prejudice and the legislature has cautiously entrusted the\n\nconfiscation proceeding to an “Authorized Officer” whereas the trial\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                   20</span>\n\fhas been entrusted to the “Special Court”, and that is why the words\n\ni.e. “Authorized Officer” and “Special Court” have been separately\n\ndefined and the distinction is evident and it is quite clear that\n\nconfiscation proceeding and criminal trial against accused of an\n\noffence are not conducted by the same judicial officer; and, therefore,\n\nthe likelihood of bias is not allowed to have any room.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">19. The High Court of Patna while dealing with the vice of <a href=\"/doc/724908/\" id=\"a_114\">Section\n\n17(3)</a> proceeded to interpret sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 17</a> and opined\n\nthat legislature has not given a definite and fixed period of six months\n\nas the time for disposal of appeal regard being had to the phraseology\n\nused in the provision, for it has been stipulated that an appeal\n\npreferred under sub-section (1) shall be disposed of preferably within a\n\nperiod of six months from the date it is preferred, and stay order, if\n\nany, passed in an appeal shall not remain in force beyond the\n\nprescribed period of disposal of appeal. The High Court has observed\n\nthat the use of word “preferably” is a definite pointer that the\n\nlegislature has only indicated its preference that the appeal should be\n\ndisposed of within a period of six months but it also permits disposal\n\nof the appeal beyond the period of six months and, therefore, it will\n\nnot be proper to construe that the prescribed period for disposal of an\n\nappeal is only six months.     As a logical corollary, it ruled that six\n\nmonths is not the prescribed period of disposal of appeal, but it is only\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                   21</span>\n\fdesirable that the appeal should be disposed of within six months,\n\nand, accordingly, the stay order passed by the High Court will not lose\n\nits force automatically on expiry of any particular period. Placing such\n\nan interpretation, the High Court of Patna expressed the view that the\n\nsaid interpretation is to be preferred in order to save the provision\n\nfrom the vice of unreasonableness by causing undue hardship to the\n\ndelinquent-appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">20. Dwelling on the issue of refund as contained under <a href=\"/doc/1093594/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 19</a> is\n\nconcerned, the High Court found merit in the contention advanced on\n\nbehalf of the writ petitioners and observed that there can be no\n\njustification to cause any hardship or loss to the delinquent or the\n\naccused once the confiscation proceeding fails because it is the\n\nconstitutional obligation of the State that it shall not act in an\n\nunreasonable manner. Being of this view, it clarified that <a href=\"/doc/1093594/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 19</a>\n\nrequires clarification by way of interpretation that ordinarily when the\n\nconfiscation is modified or annulled by the High Court in an appeal or\n\nwhere the person affected is acquitted by the Special Court, the money\n\nor property or both shall be returned to the person affected, and for\n\nnot returning the property, the State shall have to seek permission of\n\nthe High Court or the Special Court as the case may be to return only\n\nthe price of the property and such permission shall be granted only\n\nwhen the State is able to show good reasons as to why it is not\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                  22</span>\n\fpossible to return the property. So far as the rate of interest of 5% per\n\nannum is concerned, it is clearly insufficient and hence, in case the\n\nconfiscated property is not returned by showing good reasons that it is\n\nnot possible to do so, the interest payable must be at the usual bank\n\nrate prevailing during the relevant period for a loan to purchase or\n\nacquire similar property and then alone the constitutionality of the\n\nsaid provision can be saved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">21. Dealing with the grievance relating to forceful eviction from\n\ndwelling house ordinarily occupied by the delinquent/accused prior to\n\nfinal determination of guilt in course of trial for the offence, as\n\ncontemplated under <a href=\"/doc/505579/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 18</a> of the Act, the Division Bench\n\nobserved that the said provision makes no distinction between the\n\nproperties found fit for confiscation, for all the properties subjected to\n\nconfiscation proceeding whether they are dwelling house or other\n\nkinds of property have been treated alike.           Addressing to the\n\nsubmission that an exception should have been made in respect of a\n\ndwelling house or unit where the delinquent/accused ordinarily\n\nresides himself with or without his family, because the dwelling house\n\nmeets one of the basic needs of a person and it would be arbitrary to\n\ndeprive a delinquent of such basic requirement when the trial is still\n\npending and taking note of the argument on behalf of the State that\n\nthe entire confiscated property has to be treated similarly and not\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                   23</span>\n\fmaking of an exception for a dwelling house or unit from the\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/505579/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 18</a> does not violate any constitutional provision,\n\nthe High Court opined that no distinction made between the two sets\n\nof properties is justified. That apart, the Court held that once the\n\nrelevant purpose is to confiscate all the ill-gotten money or property,\n\neven if such property includes a dwelling house or unit also under the\n\nscheme of the Act, and if there would be any exclusion, it would, to a\n\nlarge extent, frustrate the object of the Act instead of subserving the\n\npurposes of the Act.    It further opined that if after undergoing the\n\nreasonable procedure of confiscation proceeding, including appeal, a\n\ndwelling house or unit of the delinquent is found to be ill-gotten\n\nproperty which cannot be accounted for on the basis of lawful income\n\nof the delinquent, there can be hardly any justification to allow the\n\ndelinquent to continue in enjoyment of such ill- gotten property only\n\nbecause the trial is still pending.      The legislature having taken\n\nprecautions to expedite the trial and if it is made to linger inspite of\n\nsuch provisions, the accused would always be at liberty to take\n\nremedial action and get the trial expedited.     Being of this view, the\n\nWrit Court found that the said provision does not violate any of the\n\nfacets of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_120\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_121\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">22. It was also urged before the High Court that the confiscation\n\nproceedings as provided under the Act is impermissible because it\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                   24</span>\n\fleaves no option to the affected person but to disclose his defence prior\n\nto holding of the trial and such compulsion upon him to disclose true\n\nstate of affairs in the confiscation proceeding frustrates the right\n\nguaranteed by the <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_122\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution. The High Court did\n\nnot find any substance in the said submission and opined that grant\n\nof opportunity in confiscation proceeding to the delinquent official\n\ncannot be construed as compelling him to be a witness against\n\nhimself.   It also opined that considering the nature of the two\n\nproceedings, both could be maintained together or one after another,\n\nfor the order of confiscation has been made subject to a final judgment\n\nin the trial by the Special Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">23. Dealing with an Interlocutory Application bearing No. 10468 of\n\n2010 filed in CWJC No. 10735/2010 after dealing with the\n\nconstitutional validity of the Act, the High Court expressed its\n\nunwillingness to decide the vires of the 2010 Rules which was sought\n\nto be challenged as the said I.A. was not pressed. However, the High\n\nCourt observed as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">    “Although we have given the liberty aforesaid but sometimes it\n    is useful to observe certain facts in order to avoid unnecessary\n    litigation. In respect of Bihar Special Court’s Rules, 2010 a\n    grievance was raised that Rule 12(f) envisages a procedure\n    which is contrary to procedure prescribed for trial of warrant\n    cases before a Magistrate which has been prescribed by <a href=\"/doc/926596/\" id=\"a_123\">Section\n    18(1)</a> of the Act. It goes without saying that in case of conflict\n    between Act of Legislature and Rules framed under the Act, the\n    provisions of the Act will prevail. The State of Bihar is expected\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                     25</span>\n\f     to take note of the aforesaid submission in its own interest and\n     amend the relevant Rule if there is any need felt for the same.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">24. Thus, the High Court interpreted certain provisions to sustain\n\nthe constitutional validity of the Act and as far as the Rule is\n\nconcerned observed as above, and thereafter dismissed the writ\n\npetitions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_30\">25.

At the outset, we think it appropriate to mention that the learned\n\ncounsel for the parties had addressed at length with regard to the\n\nissues raised before the High Court and also canvassed certain issues\n\nof law before us and we had permitted them to argue the matter from\n\nall angles.   Before we enumerate the issues that have been urged\n\nbefore the High Court and the additional points that have been\n\ncanvassed before us, it is necessary to understand the background of\n\nthe legislation. We have already indicated at the beginning the purpose\n\nof enacting the legislation by the States of Odisha and Bihar and have\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                  26</span>\n\fscanned the scheme of both the Acts and also adumbrated upon the\n\nreasoning    ascribed   by   the    High   Courts   while   upholding   the\n\nconstitutional validity of the enactments. Be it noted, the objects and\n\nreasons of the Orissa Act as well as that of the Bihar Act are almost\n\nsimilar. Therefore, we only reproduce the objects and reasons of the\n\nOrissa Act. It reads as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     “<a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_124\">An Act</a> to provide for the constitution of special courts for\n     the speedy trial of certain class of offences and for\n     confiscation of the properties involved.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">          WHEREAS corruption is perceived to be amongst the\n     persons holding high political and public offices in the State\n     of Orissa;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">          AND, WHEREAS, investigations conducted by the\n     agencies of the Government disclose prima facie evidence,\n     confirming existence of such corruptions;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">           AND WHEREAS, the Government have reasons to\n     believe that large number of persons, who had held or are\n     holding high political and public offices have accumulated\n     vast property, disproportionate to their known sources of\n     income by resorting to corrupt means;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">          AND, WHEREAS, it is constitutional, legal and moral\n     obligation of the State to prosecute persons involved in such\n     corrupt practices;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">           AND, WHEREAS, the existing courts of Special Judges\n     cannot reasonably be expected to bring the trials, arising out\n     of those prosecutions, to a speedy termination and it is\n     imperative for the efficient functioning of a parliamentary\n     democracy and the institutions created by or under the\n     Constitution of India that the aforesaid offenders should be\n     tried with utmost dispatch;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">            AND WHEREAS, it is necessary for the said purpose to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                     27</span>\n\f       establish Special Courts to be presided over by the persons\n       who are or have been Sessions Judge and it is also\n       expedient to make some procedural changes whereby\n       avoidable delay in the final determination of the guilt or\n       innocence, of the persons to be tried, is eliminated without\n       interfering with the right to a fair trial.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">27. The objects and reasons and various provisions of the Act which\n\nwe have referred to in course of our narration would show that there is\n\nimmense emphasis on corruption by the people holding high political\n\nand public offices.      The stress is on accumulation of wealth\n\ndisproportionate to the known sources of their income by resorting to\n\ncorrupt practices. Corruption at high levels has been taken note of by\n\nthis Court in many a judgment. This Court has also on the basis of\n\nreports of certain Commissions/Committees, from time to time, has\n\npainfully addressed to the burning issue of corruption.       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"199141576\" id=\"span_51\">In <a href=\"/doc/199141576/\" id=\"a_125\">Manoj\n\nNarula v.

A democratic republic polity hopes and\n\naspires to be governed by a government which is run by the elected\n\nrepresentatives who do not have any involvement in serious criminal\n\noffences or offences relating to corruption, casteism, societal problems,\n\naffecting the sovereignty of the nation and many other offences.</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">10</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">     (2014) 9 SCC 1\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                   28</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">\f28. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"15111331\" id=\"span_54\">In       <a href=\"/doc/15111331/\" id=\"a_126\">Niranjan   Hemchandra        Sashittal    v.

The Court further observed that immoral\n\nacquisition of wealth destroys the energy of the people believing in\n\nhonesty, and history records with agony how they have suffered; and\n\nthe only redeeming fact is that collective sensibility respects such\n\nsuffering as it is in consonance with the constitutional morality.

The learned counsel for the\n\nappellants have submitted that there cannot be any cavil over the\n\nissue that corruption should be hindered from all angles, but when\n\nthe State legislature brings a new law into existence despite an earlier\n\nlaw, that is, the 1988 Act, the special legislation has to withstand\n\nclose scrutiny and satisfy the test that is warranted under the\n\nconstitutional parameters.

That apart, there is inherent inconsistency\n\nbetween the 1988 Act and the Orissa Act and that allows enough\n\nroom for repugnancy, as is understood within the conceptual sweep\n\nof Article 254(2) of the Constitution, to set in.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">(E) The State legislation makes a distinction between the other\n\noffences under <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 13</a> and <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_134\">13(1)(e)</a> without any intelligible\n\ndifferentia between the two categories of offences and in the absence\n\nof any justifiable classification test, the provision is ultra vires the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                  31</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_135\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">(F) The corruption on which the fulcrum of argument of the State\n\nrests for bringing such a legislation is impermissible inasmuch as\n\ncorruption is an all India phenomenon and in other States, similarly\n\nsituated persons are tried under the 1988 Act, but in Odisha they\n\nare tried under the special provisions for no manifest reason.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">(G) The Orissa Act does not define “high political offices” and “high\n\npublic offices” but an attempt has been made to define the same in\n\nthe Rules, but the Rules cannot stand as pillars to support the\n\nconstitutional validity of the legislation.

The proviso which carves out an exception to enable a\n\ndelinquent officer to retain the dwelling house on payment of the\n\nmarket price is in a way deceptive inasmuch as all the properties\n\nand bank accounts are seized it is well-nigh impossible to offer the\n\nmarket price and the legislature has not kept in view that the law\n\ndoes not envisage an impossible act to be done.

That\n\n  apart, in the instant case, the Special Courts are established after\n\n  obtaining the assent from the President and, therefore, the provision\n\n  for establishing the Special Courts by the State Government in\n\n  consultation with the High Court does not become unconstitutional.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">  (III) The submission that the assent has not been obtained in\n\n  respect of all the provisions of the Orissa Act and, therefore, the\n\n  Orissa Act is invalid and cannot withstand scrutiny, is absolutely\n\n  unsustainable, for the entire enactment with notes were sent for the\n\n  assent of the President and the same has been given due assent by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                  35</span>\n\fthe President as required under the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">(IV) The submission that the provisions of the Orissa Act are\n\nrepugnant to other enactment as the provisions encroach upon the\n\noffences   under   the    Acts,   namely,   the   <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_148\">Prevention    of   Money\n\nLaundering Act, 2002</a>, as amended in 2009, is totally untenable as\n\nthe sphere of operation is altogether different.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">(V) The submission that there is no rationale to differently try the\n\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> separating it from other\n\noffences under <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 13</a> in the backdrop of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_151\">Article 14</a>, is\n\nabsolutely unacceptable inasmuch as there is a gulf of difference\n\nbetween the two categories of offences as the offence under <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_152\">Section\n\n13(1)(e)</a> relates to amassing of wealth disproportionate to the income\n\nof the person.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">(VI)    The stand that the Act does not define “high political office”\n\nand “high public office” and hence, confers unfettered discretion on\n\nthe executive is sans       substance, for the said words are well\n\nunderstood and really do not allow any room for exercise of any\n\narbitrary power. Quite apart from that, the State Government has\n\nframed the rules which supplement the Act. In this backdrop, the\n\nquestion    of   any   discrimination   taking    place,   as   argued,   is\n\ninconceivable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">(VII)    The principle of speedier disposal of corruption cases at\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                   36</span>\n\fhigh levels, especially instituted under <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the 1988\n\nAct, is definitely a ground to sustain the provisions of the Orissa\n\nAct.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">(VIII) The plea that provisions, namely, <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_154\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/600637/\" id=\"a_155\">6</a>, and the\n\nprovisions   pertaining   to   confiscation   being   irrational   and\n\ndiscriminatory, are violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_156\">Article 14</a>, is wholly unacceptable\n\ninasmuch as the classification in respect of offences, that is, <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_157\">Section\n\n13(1)(a)</a> to (1)(e), stand on a different footing and the intelligible\n\ndifferentia is clearly demonstrable. The attack on the provisions on\n\nthe plank of unbridled conferment of power on the executive to pick\n\nand choose pertaining to the declaration is on an erroneous\n\nunderstanding of the provision, for the provision has to be read in\n\nan apposite manner to convey the meaning that the State\n\nGovernment has extremely limited discretion only to see whether\n\nthe offence falls under <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> or not and the moment a\n\nperson covered    under the Act is booked for the offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 13(1)(e)</a>, the State Government has no further discretion\n\nthan to make a declaration to transfer the case to the Special Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">(IX) The challenge to the confiscatory proceeding which is ‘pro tem’\n\nin nature, is devoid of any merit, for it is constitutionally\n\npermissible inasmuch as acquisition of property by the delinquent\n\nis associated with ill-gotten money and has no connection with the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                 37</span>\n\fproperty   which is acquired by        the   person   from   acceptable\n\ncomponent of his earnings.       The submission that retention of a\n\ndwelling house on payment of market price is extremely harsh and,\n\nin fact, it effectively affects the right to life as is understood within\n\nthe broader umbrella of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_160\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution is based on\n\nerroneous premises.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">(X) The argument that the accused persons being tried in respect of\n\nother offences under the 1988 Act do not face the situation of\n\ninterim confiscation, whereas the accused persons facing trial under\n\nthe Orissa Act face the confiscation proceedings which is arbitrary\n\nhas no legs to stand upon if the classification as regards offences\n\nand the forum is valid, for that, as a natural corollary, would\n\nstructurally protect the interim confiscation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">(XI) The assailment as regards the retrospective applicability is\n\nconcerned, may, on a first blush, look quite attractive but on a\n\nkeener scrutiny it has to pale into insignificance. The plea that it\n\nplays foul of <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_161\">Article 20(1)</a> of the Constitution is absolutely unsound.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">(XII) The provisions relating to confiscation are absolutely guided\n\nand, in fact, a judicial officer of the rank of Sessions Judge or\n\nAdditional Sessions Judge is nominated as the authorised officer\n\nand there is an appeal provided from his order which would show\n\nthat the confiscation is not done at the whim and caprice of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                  38</span>\n\f  executive but after affording adequate opportunity to the delinquent\n\n  officer. Therefore, it is not hit by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_162\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">  (XIII)      The criticism that the provision for order of stay passed by\n\n  the appellate court, that is, the High Court, shall remain in force for\n\n  a period of three months may be treated as a directory provision so\n\n  as to require the court to dispose of the appeal within three months;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">  and the order of stay, if any, passed in an appeal shall not remain\n\n  in force beyond the prescribed period of disposal of appeal.\n\n  (XIV) The challenge to Section 19 of the Orissa Act which pertains to\n\n  release of the confiscated property after the release order and\n\n  further provision that if it is not possible to return, to pay the value\n\n  with five      per cent interest per annum has to be appropriately\n\n  understood, for this can only happen in a very rarest occasion and\n\n  the words used in the provision are to be appropriately understood\n\n  because of some reason beyond control like due to natural disaster\n\n  or some other calamity; and not because of any appropriation of the\n\n  property by the State Government. In essence, the submission is,\n\n  the said provision can be read down to sustain its constitutional\n\n  validity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">33. First, we shall take up the issue pertaining to the introduction of\n\nthe Bill as a money bill in the State legislature. Mr. Vinoo Bhagat,\n\nlearned counsel appearing for some of the appellants, has laid\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                     39</span>\n\femphasis on the said aspect. <a href=\"/doc/1862193/\" id=\"a_163\">Article 199</a> of the Constitution, defines\n\nMoney Bills. For our present purpose, sub-article (3) of <a href=\"/doc/1862193/\" id=\"a_164\">Article 199</a>\n\nbeing relevant is reproduced below:-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_48\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">      “(3). If any question arises whether a Bill introduced in the\n      Legislature of a State which has a Legislative Council is a\n      Money Bill or not, the decision of the Speaker of the\n      Legislative Assembly of such State thereon shall be final.”\n\n\n       We have extracted the same as we will be referring to the\n\nauthorities as regards interpretation of the said sub-article.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_49\">34. Placing reliance on <a href=\"/doc/1862193/\" id=\"a_165\">Article 199</a>, learned counsel would submit\n\nthat the present Act which was introduced as a money bill has\n\nremotely any connection with the concept of money bill. It is urged by\n\nhim that the State has made a Sisyphean endeavour to establish some\n\nconnection. The High Court to repel the challenge had <a href=\"/doc/183165917/\" id=\"a_166\">placed reliance\n\nupon</a> <a href=\"/doc/1319004/\" id=\"a_167\">Article 212</a> which stipulates that the validity of any proceedings\n\nin the Legislature of a State shall not be called in question on the\n\nground of any alleged irregularity of procedure.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_50\">35. Learned counsel for the appellants has drawn inspiration from a\n\npassage from Special Reference No. 1 of 196413, wherein it has been\n\nheld that <a href=\"/doc/1690488/\" id=\"a_168\">Article 212(1)</a> lays down that the validity of any proceedings\n\nin the legislature of a State shall not be called in question on the\n\nground of any alleged irregularity of procedure and <a href=\"/doc/1567843/\" id=\"a_169\">Article 212(2)</a>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">13</span>\n     AIR 1965 SC 745\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                   40</span>\n\fconfers immunity on the officers and members of the legislature in\n\nwhom powers are vested by or under the Constitution for regulating\n\nprocedure or the conduct of business, or for maintaining order, in the\n\nlegislature from being subject to the jurisdiction of any court in\n\nrespect of the exercise by him of those powers. The Court opined that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1690488/\" id=\"a_170\">Article 212(1)</a> seems to make it possible for a citizen to call in question\n\nin the appropriate Court of law the validity of any proceedings inside\n\nthe Legislative Chamber if his case is that the said proceedings suffer\n\nnot from mere irregularity of procedure, but from an illegality. If the\n\nimpugned procedure is illegal and unconstitutional, it would be open\n\nto be scrutinised in a Court of law, though such scrutiny is prohibited\n\nif the complaint against the procedure is not more than that the\n\nprocedure was irregular.          Thus, the said authority has made a\n\ndistinction      between   illegality   of   procedure   and   irregularity   of\n\nprocedure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">36. Our attention has also been drawn to certain paragraphs from\n\nthe Constitution Bench decision in Raja Ram Pal v. Hon’ble\n\nSpeaker, Lok Sabha and Others14. In the said case, in paragraphs\n\n360 and 366, it has been held thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"811277\" id=\"span_71\">“360. The question of extent of judicial review of\n       parliamentary matters has to be resolved with reference to\n       the provision contained in <a href=\"/doc/953264/\" id=\"a_171\">Article 122(1)</a> that corresponds to\n       <a href=\"/doc/1319004/\" id=\"a_172\">Article 212</a> referred to in <a href=\"/doc/811277/\" id=\"a_173\">M.S.M. Sharma v. Dr. Shree Krishna</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">14</span>\n     (2007) 3 SCC 184\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                        41</span>\n\f       Sinha, AIR 1960 SC 1186 [Pandit Sharma (II)]. On a plain\n       reading, <a href=\"/doc/953264/\" id=\"a_174\">Article 122(1)</a> prohibits “the validity of any\n       proceedings in Parliament” from being “called in question” in\n       a court merely on the ground of “irregularity of procedure”.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">       In other words, the procedural irregularities cannot be used\n       by the court to undo or vitiate what happens within the four\n       walls of the legislature. But then, “procedural irregularity”\n       stands in stark contrast to “substantive illegality’ which\n       cannot be found included in the former. We are of the\n       considered view that this specific provision with regard to\n       check on the role of the judicial organ vis-à-vis proceedings\n       in Parliament uses language which is neither vague nor\n       ambiguous and, therefore, must be treated as the\n       constitutional   mandate     on    the  subject,    rendering\n       unnecessary search for an answer elsewhere or invocation of\n       principles of harmonious construction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_53\">                                 xxxxxxxxxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">       366. The touchstone upon which parliamentary actions\n       within the four walls of the legislature were examined was\n       both the constitutional as well as substantive law. The\n       proceedings which may be tainted on account of substantive\n       illegality or unconstitutionality, as opposed to those suffering\n       from mere irregularity thus cannot be held protected from\n       judicial scrutiny by <a href=\"/doc/953264/\" id=\"a_175\">Article 122(1)</a> inasmuch as the broad\n       principle <a href=\"/doc/811277/\" id=\"a_176\">laid down in</a> Bradlaugh, (1884) 12 QBD 271 : 53\n       LJQB 290 : 50 LT 620, acknowledging exclusive cognizance\n       of the legislature in England has no application to the system\n       of governance provided by our Constitution wherein no organ\n       is sovereign and each organ is amenable to constitutional\n       checks and controls, in which scheme of things, this Court is\n       entrusted with the duty to be watchdog of and guarantor of\n       the Constitution.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">37. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"60568976\" id=\"span_74\">In this regard, we may profitably refer to the authority in <a href=\"/doc/60568976/\" id=\"a_177\">Mohd.\n\nSaeed Siddiqui v. State of Uttar Pradesh</a> and another15, wherein\n\na three-Judge Bench while dealing with such a challenge, held that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1319004/\" id=\"a_178\">Article 212</a> precludes the courts from interfering with the presentation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">15</span>\n     (2014) 11 SCC 415\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                     42</span>\n\fof a Bill for assent to the Governor on the ground of non-compliance\n\nwith the procedure for passing Bills, or from otherwise questioning the\n\nBills passed by the House, for proceedings inside the legislature\n\ncannot be called into question on the ground that they have not been\n\ncarried on in accordance with the Rules of Business. Thereafter, the\n\nCourt referring to <a href=\"/doc/74756/\" id=\"a_179\">Article 199(3)</a> ruled that the decision of the Speaker\n\nof the Legislative Assembly that the Bill in question was a Money Bill\n\nis final and <a href=\"/doc/60568976/\" id=\"a_180\">the said decision</a> cannot be disputed nor can the\n\nprocedure of the State Legislature be questioned by virtue of Article</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">212. The Court took note of the decision in Raja Ram Pal (supra)\n\nwherein it has been held that the proceedings which may be tainted\n\non account of substantive or gross irregularity or unconstitutionality\n\nare not protected from judicial scrutiny. Eventually, the Court repelled\n\nthe challenge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">38. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"60568976\" id=\"span_77\">In our considered opinion, the authorities cited by the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellants do not render much assistance, for the\n\nintroduction of a bill, as has been held in <a href=\"/doc/60568976/\" id=\"a_181\">Mohd. Saeed Siddiqui</a>\n\n(supra), comes within the concept of “irregularity” and it does come\n\nwith the realm of substantiality.</span> What has been held in the Special\n\nReference No. 1 of 1964 (supra) has to be appositely understood.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"60568976\" id=\"span_78\">The factual matrix therein was totally different than the case at hand\n\nas we find that the present controversy is wholly covered by the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                  43</span>\n\fpronouncement in <a href=\"/doc/60568976/\" id=\"a_182\">Mohd.

The next issue pertains to understanding of ambit and sweep of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/874453/\" id=\"a_183\">Article 247</a> of the Constitution. The said Article reads as follows:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">    “Article 247. Power of Parliament to provide for the\n    establishment       of    certain    additional     courts.—\n    Notwithstanding anything in this Chapter, Parliament may\n    by law provide for the establishment of any additional courts\n    for the better administration of laws made by Parliament or\n    of any existing laws with respect to a matter enumerated in\n    the Union List.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_59\">40. Relying on the said constitutional provision, learned counsel has\n\nproponed that the Article empowers the Parliament to provide for\n\nestablishment of certain additional courts and that too for the better\n\nadministration of laws made by Parliament. He has contended that no\n\npart of the Constitution confers power on State legislature to create\n\nadditional courts for administering central laws and, therefore, the\n\nOrissa Act is ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/874453/\" id=\"a_184\">Article 247</a> of the Constitution.         He has\n\nreferred to <a href=\"/doc/1120803/\" id=\"a_185\">Article 366(10)</a> of the Constitution to buttress the\n\nproposition that courts can be established in respect of central laws\n\nonly by the Parliament and not by the State legislature, for the said\n\nArticle denudes the State legislature the competence to make laws and\n\ncreate   additional   courts   for   administering   laws   made   by   the\n\nParliament.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_60\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                     44</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"181443842\" id=\"span_81\">41. The aforesaid submission has to be carefully scrutinised. The\n\nArticle is not to be understood the way it is put forth. Recently, in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/181443842/\" id=\"a_186\">Madras Bar Association v. Union of India and another</a> 16, a\n\ncontention was advanced by the Union of India, respondent therein,\n\nthat <a href=\"/doc/874453/\" id=\"a_187\">Article 247</a> empowers Parliament to establish additional courts\n\nfor better administration in respect of laws passed under List I of the\n\nSeventh Schedule of the Constitution. After reproducing <a href=\"/doc/874453/\" id=\"a_188\">Article 247</a>,\n\nthe Constitution Bench noted the following submissions which throw\n\nsome light:-</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_62\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">       “Referring to the above provision, it was the assertion of the\n       learned counsel for the respondents, that power was\n       expressly vested with Parliament to establish additional\n       courts for better administration of laws. It was submitted\n       that this was exactly what Parliament had chosen to do while\n       enacting the <a href=\"/doc/1850110/\" id=\"a_189\">NTT Act</a>. Referring to the objects and reasons,\n       indicating the basis of the enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/1850110/\" id=\"a_190\">NTT Act</a>, it was\n       the categorical assertion at the hands of the learned counsel,\n       that the impugned enactment was promulgated with the\n       clear understanding that NTT would provide better\n       adjudication of legal issues arising out of direct/indirect tax\n       laws.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_63\">42. Be it noted, in the said case, the constitutional validity of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1850110/\" id=\"a_191\">National Tax Tribunal Act, 2005</a> was called in question on many a\n\nground. One of the grounds that was urged by the petitioner therein\n\nwas that the appellate power of the High Court in respect of\n\nsubstantial question of law could not have been taken away by the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">16</span>\n     (2014) 10 SCC 1\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                     45</span>\n\fParliament. Defending the legislation, the respondents apart from\n\nother grounds, had also laid emphasis on <a href=\"/doc/874453/\" id=\"a_192\">Article 247</a> and we have\n\nreproduced the paragraph from the judgment. It has to be borne in\n\nmind that this Court was dealing with the abolition of the appellate\n\njurisdiction enshrined under Article 260<a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_193\">A of the Income Tax Act, 1961</a>\n\nby the <a href=\"/doc/1850110/\" id=\"a_194\">National Tax Tribunal Act, 2005</a> which had not taken away the\n\npower of judicial review. The submission on behalf of the Union of\n\nIndia was that its power to establish the courts is created under a\n\nstatute. Keeping that in view, we have to focus on the 1988 Act. In\n\nthe 1988 Act, under <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_195\">Section 3</a> special Judges stand appointed by the\n\nconcerned States to deal with the offences and the State Governments\n\nin consultation with the High Court appoint requisite special Judges.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_196\">Section 3</a> of the 1988 Act provides that the Central Government or the\n\nState Government may, by notification in the Official Gazette, appoint\n\nas many special Judges as may be necessary for such area or areas or\n\nfor such case or group of cases as may be specified in the notification\n\nto try any offence punishable under this Act; and any conspiracy to\n\ncommit or any attempt to commit or any abetment of any of the\n\noffences specified in clause (a) of sub-section (1) of the said Section.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1413227\" id=\"span_84\">43. The present Orissa Act which specifically deals with offences\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_197\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> and provides for Special Courts for the trial of\n\nthe said offences has got the assent of the President.

Presently, one\n\npart of the offence has been carved out and after obtaining assent\n\nSpecial Courts have been established. In view of the fact situation, it\n\ndoes not violate <a href=\"/doc/874453/\" id=\"a_198\">Article 247.</a> That apart, the language employed in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/874453/\" id=\"a_199\">Article 247</a> does not take away the jurisdiction of the State legislature\n\nfor constitution of courts.   Entry 11-A of List III of the Seventh\n\nSchedule, which provides for “administration of Justice; constitution\n\nand organisation of all courts, except the Supreme Court and the High\n\nCourts”, has been transferred from Entry 3 of List I by the 42 nd\n\nConstitution (Amendment) Act, 1976 in order to make it a concurrent\n\npower.      It was opined in <a href=\"/doc/1413227/\" id=\"a_200\">O. N. Mohindroo v. The Bar Council Of\n\nDelhi &amp; Ors17</a> that it was within the exclusive power of the State. After\n\nthe amendment both Parliament and the State legislature are\n\nempowered under the Constitution to give the High Court general\n\npower including territorial jurisdiction and also take away jurisdiction\n\nand powers from the High Court which have been conferred by the\n\nstatutory law by enacting appropriate legislation which is referable to\n\nadministration of justice.    But, it cannot take away the power\n\nspecifically conferred on the High Courts under the Constitution.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1286645\" id=\"span_86\">This\n\nprinciple has been stated in the following terms in <a href=\"/doc/1286645/\" id=\"a_201\">Jamshed N.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">17</span>\n     AIR 1968 SC 888\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                  47</span>\n\fGuzdar v.

It may be also\n       noticed that some of the decisions rendered dealing with\n       Entry 3 of List II prior to 3-1-1977 touching “administration\n       of justice” support the view that conferment of general\n       jurisdiction is covered under the topic “administration of\n       justice”. After 3-1-1977 a part of Entry 3 namely\n       “administration of justice” is shifted to List III under Entry\n       11-A. This only shows that the topic “administration of\n       justice” can now be legislated both by the Union as well as\n       the State Legislatures. As long as there is no Union\n       legislation touching the same topic, and there is no\n       inconsistency between the Central legislation and State\n       legislation on this topic, it cannot be said that the State\n       Legislature had no competence to pass the 1987 Act and the\n       1986 Act.”</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">44. Interpreting Entry 11-A this Court in the Special Courts Bill,\n\n197819 has held that Parliament has concurrent power to set up\n\nSpecial Courts for the trial of offences of special class. In this regard,\n\nwe may reproduce the relevant passage from the said authority:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">        “44. The challenge to the legislative competence of\n        Parliament to provide for the creation of Special Courts is\n        devoid of substance. Entry 11-A of the Concurrent List\n        relates to “Administration of justice; constitution and\n        organisation of all courts, except the Supreme Court and\n        the High Court”. By virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1817786/\" id=\"a_203\">Article 246 (2)</a>, Parliament has\n        clearly the power to make laws with respect to the\n        constitution and organisation, that is to say, the creation\n        and setting up of Special Courts. Clause 2 of the Bill is\n        therefore within the competence of the Parliament to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">18</span>\n     (2005) 2 SCC 591\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">19</span>\n     (1979) 1 SCC 380\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                     48</span>\n\f      enact.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_66\">45. Be it noted that a contention was raised that Parliament could\n\nnot have created Special Courts but the Court repelled the said\n\nsubmission and accepted the contention that such a power exists with\n\nParliament in view of <a href=\"/doc/1804716/\" id=\"a_204\">Articles 138(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/671198/\" id=\"a_205\">246(1)</a> and Entries 77, 78\n\nand 99 of List I of the Seventh Schedule and Entry 11-A of List III and\n\nthe courts can be created by the State legislature as well as by the\n\nParliament. As has been indicated earlier, <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_206\">Section 3</a> of the 1988 Act\n\nempowers the State Government to constitute special courts and when\n\na category of offence has been segregated and for the said purpose the\n\nOrissa Act has been enacted and assent has been taken, the power to\n\nconstitute special courts cannot be found to be fallacious.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">46.   Under the scheme of the Constitution, the courts as established\n\nby the State are to administer the laws made by the Parliament as well\n\nas by the State legislature and have the obligation to carry the\n\nadministration of justice but the same is subject to Entry 77 and\n\nEntry 78 of List I. Entry 77 and Entry 78 of List I read as follows:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">      “Entry 77.

Entry 46 of List III in this context needs to be reproduced:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">     “Entry 46.

Jurisdiction and powers of all courts, except the\n     Supreme Court, with respect to any of the matters in this\n     List.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_70\">48. The aforesaid entries make it clear that as regards jurisdiction\n\nand powers of the Supreme Court, the Parliament has exclusive\n\nlegislative competency and as far as the jurisdiction other than\n\nSupreme Court and the High Courts is concerned, the power can be\n\nexercised by the Union and the State legislature. The purpose of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/874453/\" id=\"a_207\">Article 247</a>, which commences with a non-obstante clause, is to confer\n\npower on the Parliament to create additional courts for the better\n\nadministration of a particular Union law, but it cannot be said that\n\nthe State cannot make laws for adjudication and administration of\n\njustice in respect of a parliamentary legislation more so, when initially\n\npower was conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 3</a> of the 1988 Act and assent has\n\nbeen accorded for establishment of Special Courts for adjudication of\n\nthe offence. Let it be made clear that we have so answered regard\n\nbeing had to the offence being carved out and a different category of\n\nSpecial Courts are constituted to try the said offence. It does not take\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                    50</span>\n\faway the power already conferred under <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 3</a> of the 1988 Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_71\">49. The next aspect we shall dwell upon pertains to repugnancy and\n\nthe nature of “assent” obtained by the State Government from the\n\nPresident under <a href=\"/doc/665535/\" id=\"a_210\">Article 254(2)</a> of the Constitution. The submission of\n\nthe learned counsel for the appellants is that though the State\n\nlegislature reserved it for presidential assent, yet assent has not been\n\ntaken in respect of the entire Orissa Act and also in respect of other\n\nlaws, namely, the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_211\">Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002</a>, etc. as a\n\nconsequence of which it will ultimately lead to a situation of anomaly\n\nand, therefore, there is repugnancy in respect of existing legislations\n\nin similar fields enacted by the Parliament and the Orissa Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">50. <a href=\"/doc/1930681/\" id=\"a_212\">Article 254</a> deals with inconsistency between laws made by the\n\nParliament and laws made by the Legislature of States. <a href=\"/doc/665535/\" id=\"a_213\">Article 254(2)</a>\n\ndeals with laws made by the State legislature in respect of the matters\n\nenumerated in the Concurrent List.               The issue of repugnancy arises\n\nwhen the subjects come within List III of the Seventh Schedule. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"570453\" id=\"span_95\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"703764\" id=\"span_96\">In\n\n<a href=\"/doc/703764/\" id=\"a_214\">Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. &amp; Another v.

It is only when both these requirements are\n       fulfilled that the State law will, to the extent of repugnancy\n       become void. <a href=\"/doc/344383/\" id=\"a_219\">Article 254(1)</a> has no application to cases of\n       repugnancy due to overlapping found between List II on the\n       one hand and List I and List III on the other. If such\n       overlapping exists in any particular case, the State law will\n       be ultra vires because of the non-obstante clause in <a href=\"/doc/671198/\" id=\"a_220\">Article\n       246(1)</a> read with the opening words &quot;subject to&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/193529227/\" id=\"a_221\">Article\n       246(3).</a> In such a case, the State law will fail not because of\n       repugnance to the Union law but due to want of legislative\n       competence.

Thus viewed, repugnancy arises when there is a clear and direct\n\ninconsistency between the central law and the State law and such\n\ninconsistency is irreconcilable.

The exception which\n\nis carved out is under sub-clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1930681/\" id=\"a_233\">Article 254.</a> Under this\n\nsub-clause (2), where a law made by the legislature of a State with\n\nrespect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent List\n\ncontains any provision repugnant to the provisions of an earlier law\n\nmade by Parliament, then the law so made by the legislature of such\n\nState shall, if it has been reserved for the consideration of the\n\nPresident and has received his assent, prevail in the State.</span>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">27</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">     1995 (1) SCC 257\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                                   56</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"39456322\" id=\"span_117\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"91183\" id=\"span_118\">57. Another aspect with regard to repugnancy and the validity of the\n\nState legislation may be stated. If there is a parliamentary legislation\n\nand the law enacted by the State legislation can co-exist and operate\n\nwhere one Act or the other is not available, then there is no difficulty\n\nin making the State law on the fact situation available. It has been so\n\nheld in <a href=\"/doc/91183/\" id=\"a_234\">EID Parry (I) Ltd. v. G.

Having stated the proposition where and in which circumstances\n\nthe principle of repugnancy would be attracted and the legislation can\n\nbe saved or not saved, it is necessary to focus on clause (2) of Article\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">254. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1288069\" id=\"span_119\">In        <a href=\"/doc/1288069/\" id=\"a_236\">Hindustan Times v.

The relevant passage of the said authority is extracted below:-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">       “As noticed hereinbefore, the State of Uttar Pradesh intended\n       to make a legislation covering the same field but even if the\n       same was to be made, it would have been subject to the\n       parliamentary legislation unless assent of the President of\n       India was obtained in that behalf. The State executive was,\n       thus, denuded of any power in respect of a matter with\n       respect whereto Parliament has power to make laws, as its\n       competence was limited only to the matters with respect to\n       which the legislature of the State has the requisite legislative\n       competence. Even assuming that the matter relating to the\n       welfare of the working journalists is a field which falls within\n       Entry 24 of the Concurrent List, unless and until a\n       legislation is made and assent of the President is obtained,\n       the provisions of the 1955 <a href=\"/doc/761414/\" id=\"a_238\">Act and the Working Journalists\n       (Fixation of Rates and Wages) Act, 1958</a> would have prevailed\n       over the State enactment.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1981010\" id=\"span_125\">59. The issue in the instant case is that the State Government had\n\nnot complied with the requisite procedure for obtaining the assent of\n\nthe President. The criticism advanced by the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants is that in the letter written by the State Government to the\n\ncompetent authority for obtaining assent only certain provisions of the\n\nOrissa Act were mentioned but there is no reference to other\n\nprovisions and certain other legislations, which also cover the same\n\nfield. To bolster the said submission, reliance has been placed on the\n\nConstitution Bench decision in <a href=\"/doc/1981010/\" id=\"a_239\">Kaiser-I-Hind (P) Ltd. v. National\n\nTextile Corpn. (Maharashtra North) Ltd.32</a>.           In the said case, the\n\nmajority dealt with the jurisdiction of the court is to see the record and\n\nnature of the assent sought by the State.         The Court scanned the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">32</span>\n     (2002) 8 SCC 182\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                                     58</span>\n\fanatomy of <a href=\"/doc/665535/\" id=\"a_240\">Article 254(2)</a> and after analyzing the same, opined that it\n\ncan be stated that for the State law to prevail, the requirements that\n\nare to be satisfied are; (a) law made by the legislature of a State should\n\nbe with respect to one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent\n\nList; (b) it contains any provision repugnant to the provision of an\n\nearlier law made by Parliament or an existing law with respect to that\n\nmatter; (c) the law so made by the legislature of the State has been\n\nreserved for the consideration of the President; and (d) it has received\n\n“his assent”.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">60. After so stating, the Court proceeded to lay down as follows:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">    “14. In view of the aforesaid requirements, before obtaining\n    the assent of the President, the State Government has to\n    point out that the law made by the State Legislature is in\n    respect of one of the matters enumerated in the Concurrent\n    List by mentioning entry/entries of the Concurrent List and\n    that it contains provision or provisions repugnant to the law\n    made by Parliament or existing law. Further, the words\n    “reserved for consideration” would definitely indicate that\n    there should be active application of mind by the President to\n    the repugnancy pointed out between the proposed State law\n    and the earlier law made by Parliament and the necessity of\n    having such a law, in the facts and circumstances of the\n    matter, which is repugnant to a law enacted by Parliament\n    prevailing in a State. The word “consideration” would\n    manifest that after careful thinking over and due application\n    of mind regarding the necessity of having State law which is\n    repugnant to the law made by Parliament, the President may\n    grant assent. This aspect is further reaffirmed by use of the\n    word “assent” in clause (2), which implies knowledge of the\n    President to the repugnancy between the State law and the\n    earlier law made by Parliament on the same subject-matter\n    and the reasons for grant of such assent. The word “assent”\n    would mean in the context as an expressed agreement of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">                                   59</span>\n\f       mind to what is proposed by the State.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">           x        x         x        x         x\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">       20. ...As discussed above before grant of the assent,\n       consideration of the reasons for having such law is necessary\n       and the consideration would mean consideration of the\n       proposal made by the State for the law enacted despite it\n       being repugnant to the earlier law made by Parliament on\n       the same subject. If the proposal made by the State is limited\n       qua the repugnancy of the State law and law or laws\n       specified in the said proposal, then it cannot be said that the\n       assent was granted qua the repugnancy between the State\n       law and other laws for which no assent was sought for. Take\n       for illustration — that a particular provision, namely, <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_241\">Section\n       3</a> of the State law is repugnant to enactment A made by\n       Parliament; other provision, namely, <a href=\"/doc/1182345/\" id=\"a_242\">Section 4</a> is repugnant\n       to some provisions of enactment B made by Parliament and\n       <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_243\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/600637/\" id=\"a_244\">6</a> are repugnant to some provisions of\n       enactment C and the State submits proposal seeking\n       “assent” mentioning repugnancy between the State law and\n       provisions of enactments A and B without mentioning\n       anything with regard to enactment C. In this set of\n       circumstances, if the assent of the President is obtained, the\n       State law with regard to enactments A and B would prevail\n       but with regard to C, there is no proposal and hence there is\n       no “consideration” or “assent”. Proposal by the State pointing\n       out repugnancy between the State law and of the law enacted\n       by Parliament is a sine qua non for “consideration” and\n       “assent”. If there is no proposal, no question of\n       “consideration” or “assent” arises. For finding out whether\n       “assent” given by the President is restricted or unrestricted,\n       the letter written or the proposal made by the State\n       Government for obtaining “assent” is required to be looked\n       into.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">61. Proceeding further, the Court placed reliance on P.N. Krishna\n\nLal v. Govt. of Kerala33 and Hoechst Pharmaceuticals Ltd. (supra)\n\nand ruled that it cannot be said that the High Court committed any\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">33</span>\n     1995 Supp. (2) SCC 187\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">                                     60</span>\n\ferror in looking at the file of the correspondence Ext. F collectively for\n\nfinding out — for what purpose “assent” of the President to the\n\nextension of Acts extending the duration of the Bombay Rent Act was\n\nsought for and given. After so stating, the Court observed:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">        “29. We further make it clear that granting of assent under\n        <a href=\"/doc/665535/\" id=\"a_245\">Article 254(2)</a> is not exercise of legislative power of the\n        President such as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1090693/\" id=\"a_246\">Article 123</a> but is\n        part of the legislative procedure.

Finally, we would observe that the challenge of this\n        nature could be avoided if at the commencement of the Act,\n        it is stated that the Act has received the assent with regard\n        to the repugnancy between the State law and specified\n        Central law or laws.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">62. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"489698\" id=\"span_131\">In this regard, we may extract a passage from P.N.

On\n       the other hand, the observation clearly indicates that if the\n       assent is sought and given in general terms it would be\n       effective for all purposes. In other words, this Court\n       observed that the assent sought for and given by the\n       President in general terms could be effective for all purposes\n       unless specific assent is sought and given in which event it\n       would be operative only to that limited extent.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">63. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1981010\" id=\"span_132\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1214980\" id=\"span_133\">In <a href=\"/doc/1214980/\" id=\"a_248\">Rajiv Sarin and Another v.

Further, in the aforesaid case, before the\n      Madras High Court also the relevant proposal made by the\n      State was produced. The Court had specifically arrived at a\n      conclusion that Ext.

If the assent is sought and given in general\n        terms so as to be effective for all purposes, different\n        considerations may legitimately arise.

On a perusal of the aforesaid letter, it is demonstrable that the\n\nState Government had sought assent of the President in respect of\n\ncertain provisions of the 1988 Act, the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_271\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>,\n\n1973 and the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944.               On a\n\nscrutiny of the judgment of the High Court, it is manifest that on\n\nbehalf of the State certain communications were placed on record from\n\nwhich the High Court was satisfied that the assent had been properly\n\nobtained. In the course of hearing, we have also found that the entire\n\nBill was sent for the assent with the aforesaid forwarding letter and\n\nthere has been correspondence thereafter. On a perusal of the\n\ncommunication and the finding recorded by the High Court and\n\nkeeping in view the purpose of communication and taking note of the\n\nfact that the entire Bill was sent to the President for obtaining assent,\n\nit can safely be concluded that the President was apprised of the\n\nreason when the assent was sought. The assent has been given in\n\ngeneral terms so as to be effective for all purposes. It cannot be said\n\nthat the general assent by the President was not obtained. Thus, we\n\nare of the considered opinion that the provisions of the Orissa Act are\n\ndefinitely not repugnant to the 1988 Act, the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_272\">Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure</a>, 1973 and the Criminal Law Amendment Ordinance, 1944.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1716282\" id=\"span_148\">67.

Be it stated that the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_319\">Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002</a>\n\ncontains Schedules which originally contained three Parts, namely,\n\nPart A, Part B and Part C. Part A which contains various paragraphs\n\nenumerates offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_320\">Indian Penal Code, The Narcotic Drugs\n\nand Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985</a>, etc. Part B (Containing Para\n\n1 to Para 25) was omitted by Act 2 of 2013, <a href=\"/doc/1117814/\" id=\"a_321\">section 30(ii)</a> (w.e.f.\n\n15-2-2013, vide S.O. 343(E), dated 8-2-2013) and earlier Part B was\n\namended by Act 21 of 2009, <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_322\">section 13(ii)</a> (w.e.f. 1-6-2009). Part C\n\ndeals with an offence which is the offence of cross border implications\n\nand is specified in Part A or the offences against property under\n\nChapter XVII of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_323\">Indian Penal Code</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_90\">76.   At this juncture, it is appropriate to note that in 2009, the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_324\">Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002</a> was amended whereby the\n\noffences under <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_325\">Section 13</a> of the 1988 Act was incorporated in Part B\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_159\">                                    74</span>\n\fof the Schedule. It may be mentioned that same has been deleted in\n\n2013 inasmuch as the entire Part B has been deleted. The High Court\n\nin the impugned judgment has referred to Entries 93 and 44 of the\n\nUnion List whereby the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_326\">Prevention of Money- Laundering Act, 2002</a>\n\nhas been brought into force. The High Court has also taken note of the\n\nfact that the Orissa Act was enacted in 2007 regard being had to the\n\n1988 Act. The High Court has observed that the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_327\">Prevention of Money-\n\nLaundering (Amendment) Act, 2009</a> upon which reliance is placed by\n\nthe petitioners counsel therein cannot prevail upon either the 1988\n\nAct or the Orissa Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">77.   We   have   analysed   the   scheme   under   the   <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_328\">Prevention   of\n\nMoney-Laundering Act, 2002</a>. It is clearly demonstrable that the\n\noffences under the said Act are different from an offence under the\n\n1988 Act. The offence under the Orissa Act which has been carved out\n\nis the offence under <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_329\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the 1988 Act and the Orissa Act\n\nprovides for establishment of Special Courts and also provides for\n\nprovisions pertaining to confiscation at an interim stage. The entire\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_330\">Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002</a>, if keenly scrutinized,\n\nclearly reveals that it deals with different situations altogether; a\n\ndifferent offence which has insegregable nexus with money laundering.\n\nTrue it is, in 2009 an amendment was brought incorporating the 1988\n\nAct in Part B of the Schedule, and the said Part B has been totally\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">                                   75</span>\n\fdeleted in 2013. In view of the same, the submission of the learned\n\ncounsel for the State is that after deletion of Part B the issue has\n\nbecome academic.     Be that as it may, <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_331\">Part B of the Prevention of\n\nMoney-Laundering Act, 2002</a> enumerated offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_332\">Indian\n\nPenal Code, The Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act,\n\n1985</a>; <a href=\"/doc/1568384/\" id=\"a_333\">The Explosive Substances Act, 1908</a>; <a href=\"/doc/1389751/\" id=\"a_334\">The Unlawful Activities\n\n(Prevention) Act, 1967</a>; <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_335\">The Arms Act, 1959</a>; The Wildlife (Protection)\n\nAct, 1972; etc. There was a purpose behind the same. There could be\n\noffences under the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_336\">Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002</a> arising\n\nfrom the offences under the other Acts. Unless an offence under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_337\">Money Laundering Act, 2002</a> is committed and taken cognizance of by\n\nthe authorities, the offences under the other Acts can continue as that\n\nis the law in the field. Once there is money laundering, the accused\n\nmay be tried by the Special Courts as provided under the said Act.\n\nPart A enumerates offences under the Central legislation and certain\n\noffences under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_338\">Indian Penal Code</a>. The first condition precedent is\n\nthat the offence committed must pertain to money laundering. If a\n\nperson is tried under <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_339\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> satisfies the ingredients of\n\nmoney laundering, the matter would be different and hence, both the\n\nActs can harmoniously co-exist.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">78. In view of the aforesaid analysis and keeping in view the law\n\npertaining to repugnancy we have hereinbefore referred to, we are\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_161\">                                  76</span>\n\funable to accept the submission of the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants that there is repugnancy between the two <a href=\"/doc/50631952/\" id=\"a_340\">Acts and the\n\nOrissa Act</a> is invalid as no assent was obtained in respect of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_341\">Prevention of Money-Laundering Act, 2002</a>. We may hasten to clarify\n\nthat we have not addressed the issue on the impact of the deletion of\n\nPart B of the Schedule in 2013 as the legislature may have deleted it\n\nin its own wisdom.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_93\">79. Next, we shall advert to the assail made in respect of certain\n\nprovisions of the Orissa Act.      Attack on two provisions, namely,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_342\">Section 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/600637/\" id=\"a_343\">6</a>, is basically on <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_344\">Article 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_345\">Article 20(1)</a> of the\n\nConstitution.   We shall first address to the challenge made under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_346\">Article 14</a> and thereafter deal with the assail under <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_347\">Article 20(1)</a> while\n\nwe will be addressing the constitutional validity of other provisions, for\n\nit has been contended before us by the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants that the provisions pertaining to confiscation and other\n\nmatters are punishments at the pre-trial stage and hence, the person\n\nsuffers from double jeopardy. That apart, it is urged, confiscation was\n\nnot there at time of institution of the prosecution and, therefore, the\n\namended law cannot be retrospectively applied. It has been further\n\nargued that the submission of the State that there is only a procedural\n\nchange as no one has a right to the forum is absolutely unsustainable\n\nand the appellants have been aggrieved by the substantive part and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_162\">                                   77</span>\n\fnot by the facet relating to adjective law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_94\">80.    The principal ground of attack of the said provisions is that the\n\nlegislature has not defined persons who have held “high public or\n\npolitical office”. According to them, in the absence of any definition, it\n\nis extremely arbitrary and confers unbridled powers on the State\n\nGovernment and that apart, it is quite vague as a consequence of\n\nwhich, it invites the frown of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_348\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Learned\n\ncounsel for the State, per contra, has drawn our attention to the\n\nobjects and reasons of the Act and has propounded that the concept of\n\nhigh public or political office is well understood and the provision does\n\nnot deserve to be struck down solely on the ground that there is no\n\ndefinition of the said words in the dictionary clause.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_95\">81. Be it stated, the definition in the rules have been pressed into\n\nservice. We need not look at the rules, for we have to find out whether\n\nin the provision in the context of the legislation and the purpose it\n\nintends to serve, there is enough guidance not to allow any kind of\n\narbitrariness. To appreciate the said contention, we are obligated to\n\nrefer to Section 2(d) of the Orissa Act which defines the term ‘offence’\n\nwhich reads as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">      “<a href=\"/doc/564136/\" id=\"a_349\">Section 2(d)</a>. “Offence” means an offence of criminal\n      misconduct within the meaning of clause (e) of sub-section\n      (1) of <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_350\">section 13</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">82.    <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_351\">Section 5</a> and Section 6 of the Orissa Act read as follows:-\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">                                    78</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">\f     “<a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_352\">Section 5</a>. Declaration of cases to be dealt with under\n     this Act – (1) If the State Government is of the opinion that\n     there is prima facie evidence of the commission of an offence\n     alleged to have been committed by a person, who held high\n     public or political office in the State of Orissa, the State\n     Government shall make a declaration to the effect in every\n     case in which it is of the aforesaid opinion.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">     (2) Such declaration shall not be called in question in any\n      Court.”\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/600637/\" id=\"a_353\">Section 6</a>. Effect of declaration – (1) On such declaration\n     being made, notwithstanding anything in the Code or any\n     other law for the time being in force, any prosecution in\n     respect of the offence shall be instituted only in a Special\n     Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">     (2) Where any declaration made under <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_354\">section 5</a> relates to\n     an offence in respect of which a prosecution has already\n     been instituted and the proceedings in relation thereto are\n     pending in a Court other than Special Court, such\n     proceedings shall, notwithstanding anything contained in\n     any other law for the time being in force, stand transferred\n     to Special Court for trial of the offence in accordance with\n     this Act.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_97\">83. The stand of the learned counsel for the appellants is that\n\nSection 5 of the Orissa Act confers uncanalised and unfettered\n\ndiscretion on the State Government to make a declaration as a\n\nconsequence of which the delinquent officer will have to face the\n\nprosecution in the Special Court. No guidance has been provided and\n\nin the absence of any guidance, the exercise of power would be\n\narbitrary and the State Government is at liberty to pick and choose\n\nany person as it desires. The impugned judgment would show that\n\nthe State Government had filed an affidavit on 23.7.2010 and the High\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">                                  79</span>\n\fCourt has quoted certain paragraphs from the said affidavit. The\n\nrelevant part of the affidavit shows that in the event there is prima\n\nfacie evidence of the commission of an offence alleged to have been\n\ncommitted by a person who held high public or political office in the\n\nState of Orissa as defined under the Act and the Rules, the State\n\nGovernment shall mandatorily make a declaration to that effect and\n\nthe State Government does not have any discretion on the subject. It\n\nhas also been asserted that the role of the State Government is limited\n\nto be satisfied that the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/245740/\" id=\"a_355\">Section 5(1)</a> of the Special Courts\n\nAct are existent and if the ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/245740/\" id=\"a_356\">Section 5(1)</a> of the Special\n\nCourts Act are in existence, the State Government is bound to make a\n\ndeclaration to that effect. Placing reliance on the said affidavit, the\n\nHigh Court has repelled the submission urged on behalf of the\n\npetitioners therein.     We must say without any reservation that the\n\napproach of the High Court is erroneous.          Constitutionality of a\n\nprovision has to be tested within the constitutional parameters. An\n\naffidavit filed by an officer of the State Government cannot change the\n\ninterpretation if it is textually and contextually not permissible. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"66970168\" id=\"span_165\">In\n\nSupreme Court <a href=\"/doc/66970168/\" id=\"a_357\">Advocates-on-Record Association and Another v.\n\nUnion of India36</a>, while dealing with the term “fit” expressed under\n\nSection 5(1) of the National Judicial Appointments Commission Act,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">36</span>\n     2015 (11) SCALE 1\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">                                   80</span>\n\f2014, the Court noted the submissions of the learned Attorney\n\nGeneral that the said word would only mean mental and physical\n\nfitness, and nothing else.       Commenting on the said submission,\n\nKhehar, J. stated as follows:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">        “...The present wisdom, cannot bind future generations.\n        And, it was exactly for this reason, that the respondents\n        could resile from the statement made by the then Attorney\n        General, before the Bench hearing the Third Judges case,\n        that the Union of India was not seeking a review or\n        reconsideration of the judgment in the Second Judges case\n        (that, it had accepted to treat as binding, the decision in the\n        Second Judges case). And yet, during the course of hearing\n        of the present case, the Union of India did seek a\n        reconsideration of the Second Judges case.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">84. In this regard, a passage from Sanjeev Coke Manufacturing\n\nCompany v. M/s Bharat Coking Coal Limited and Another 37 would\n\nbe apt to quote:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">       “... The deponents of the affidavits filed into court may speak\n       for the parties on whose behalf they swear to the statements.\n       They do not speak for the Parliament. No one may speak for\n       the Parliament and Parliament is never before the court.\n       After Parliament has said what it intends to say, only the\n       court may say what the Parliament meant to say. None else.\n       Once a statute leaves Parliament House, the Court is the\n       only authentic voice which may echo (interpret) the\n       Parliament. This the court will do with reference to the\n       language of the statute and other permissible aids. The\n       executive Government may place before the court their\n       understanding of what Parliament has said or intended to\n       say or what they think was Parliament’s object and all the\n       facts and circumstances which in their view led to the\n       legislation. When they do so, they do not speak for\n       Parliament. <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_358\">No Act</a> of Parliament may be struck down\n       because of the understanding or misunderstanding of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">37</span>\n     (1983) 1 SCC 147\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">                                     81</span>\n\f    parliamentary intention by the executive Government or\n    because their (the Government’s) spokesmen do not bring\n    out relevant circumstances but indulge in empty and\n    self-defeating affidavits. They do not and they cannot bind\n    Parliament. Validity of legislation is not to be judged merely\n    by affidavits filed on behalf of the State, but by all the\n    relevant circumstances which the court may ultimately find\n    and more especially by what may be gathered from what the\n    legislature has itself said...”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_99\">85. We have referred the said statement of law only to highlight that\n\nthe affidavit sworn by the Joint Secretary could not have been relied\n\nupon by the High Court for the purpose of construction of Section 5 of\n\nthe Orissa Act. Thus viewed, we have to understand, appreciate and\n\ninterpret the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_359\">Section 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/600637/\" id=\"a_360\">Section 6</a> whether\n\nthere is any scope for arbitrary use of power.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_100\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8212\" id=\"span_170\">86. The language employed in <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_361\">Section 5</a> has to be appositely\n\nscrutinized. Section 5(1) of the Orissa Act provides that if the State\n\nGovernment is of the opinion that there is prima facie evidence of the\n\ncommission of an offence alleged to have been committed by a person,\n\nwho held high public or political office in the State of Orissa, the State\n\nGovernment shall make a declaration to the effect in every case in\n\nwhich it is of the aforesaid opinion. The Division Bench of the High\n\nCourt on earlier occasion in    <a href=\"/doc/8212/\" id=\"a_362\">Kishore Chandra Patel</a>        (supra) had\n\nstruck down the part that stated “and that the said offence ought to be\n\ndealt with under the Act” and treated the rest of it as valid.        The\n\nlegislature, as is perceptible, has rightly deleted the said words.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">                                   82</span>\n\fInterpretation of the stipulations in <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_363\">Section 5</a> are to be appreciated in\n\nthe context of the scheme of the Orissa Act. <a href=\"/doc/564136/\" id=\"a_364\">Section 2(d)</a> defines the\n\nterm “offence” which means an “offence” of criminal misconduct within\n\nthe meaning of clause (e) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_365\">Section 13</a> of the 1988\n\nAct. <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_366\">Section 5(1)</a> confers power on the State to form an opinion that\n\nthere is prima facie evidence of commission of an offence alleged to\n\nhave been committed by a person who has held high public or political\n\noffice in the State of Orissa and then proceed to make the declaration\n\nto that effect. The key words, as we find, are “prima facie evidence of\n\nthe commission of the offence alleged”.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1149874\" id=\"span_172\">In <a href=\"/doc/1149874/\" id=\"a_367\">Reserve Bank of India v.\n\nPeerless General Finance and Investment Co.

The challenge\n\ntherein was to the amendments of certain provisions in the <a href=\"/doc/7832/\" id=\"a_370\">Land\n\nAcquisition Act, 1894</a>. While dealing with the concept of construction\n\nof a provision, the Court opined that a literal interpretation is not\n\nalways the only interpretation of a provision in a statute and the court\n\nhas to look at the setting in which the words are used and the\n\ncircumstances in which the law came to be passed to decide whether\n\nthere is something implicit behind the words actually used which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">39</span>\n     1990 AIR 981\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">40</span>\n     AIR 1964 SC 1230\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">                                     84</span>\n\fwould control the literal meaning, of the words used in a provision of\n\nthe statute. The Court further ruled that it is permissible to control\n\nthe wide language used in a statute if that is possible by the setting in\n\nwhich the words are used and the intention of the law-making body\n\nwhich may be apparent from the circumstances in which the\n\nparticular provision came to be made, and therefore, a literal and\n\nmechanical interpretation is not the only interpretation which courts\n\nare bound to give to the words of a statute; and it may be possible to\n\ncontrol the wide &#x27;language in which a provision is made by taking into\n\naccount what is implicit in it in view of the setting in which the\n\nprovision appears and the circumstances in which it might have been\n\nenacted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">89. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"938664\" id=\"span_179\">In <a href=\"/doc/938664/\" id=\"a_371\">TATA Engineering &amp; Locomotive Co.

In this regard, a passage from the Statutory Interpretation by\n\nJustice G.P.

SMITH “has an absolute\n        meaning, for no words can be defined in vacuo, or without\n        reference to some context”. According to SUTHERLAND\n        there is a “basic fallacy” in saying “that words have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_180\">41</span>\n     (2000) 5 SCC 346\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">                                   85</span>\n\f        meaning in and of themselves”, and “reference to the\n        abstract meaning of words”, states CRAIES, “if there be any\n        such thing, is of little value in interpreting statures”. In the\n        words of JUSTICE HOLMES : “A word is not a crystal\n        transparent and unchanged; it is the skin of a living\n        thought and may vary greatly in colour and content\n        according to the circumstances and the time in which it is\n        used.” Shorn of the context, the words by themselves are\n        “slippery customers”. Therefore, in determining the\n        meaning of any word or phrase in a statute the first\n        question to be asked is “what is the natural or ordinary\n        meaning of that word or phrase in its context in the\n        statute? It is only when that meaning leads to some result\n        which cannot reasonably be supposed to have been the\n        intention of the legislature that it is proper to look for some\n        other possible meaning of the word or phrase”.

Applying the aforesaid principle, we are inclined to think that the\n\nState Government is only to be prima facie satisfied that there is an\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_379\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> and the accused has held high public or\n\npolitical office in the State. Textually understanding, the legislation\n\nhas not clothed the State Government with the authority to scrutinize\n\nthe material for any other purpose.    The State Government has no\n\ndiscretion except to see whether the offence comes under <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_380\">Section 13(1)</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_113\">(e) or not. Such an interpretation flows when it is understood that in\n\nthe entire texture provision turns around the words “offence alleged”\n\nand “prima facie”. It can safely be held that the State Government\n\nbefore making a declaration is only required to see whether the person\n\nas understood in the context of the provision is involved in an offence\n\nunder Section 13(1)(e) of the Orissa Act and once that is seen, the\n\nconcerned authority has no other option but to make a declaration.\n\nThat is the command of the legislature and once the declaration is\n\nmade, the prosecution has to be instituted in a Special Court and that\n\nis the mandate of Section 6(1) of the Orissa Act.     Therefore, while\n\nholding that the reference to the affidavit filed by the State\n\nGovernment was absolutely unwarranted, for that cannot make a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_196\">                                  89</span>\n\fprovision constitutional if it is otherwise unconstitutional, we would\n\nuphold the constitutional validity, but on the base of above\n\ninterpretation.   The argument and challenge would fail, once on\n\ninterpretation it is held that there is no element of discretion and only\n\nprima facie satisfaction is required as laid down hereinabove.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_114\">99.       Having said that, we shall dwell upon the argument which\n\nis raised with regard to classification part, that is, that the persons\n\nholding “high public or political office” are being put in a different\n\nclass to face a trial in a different court under a different procedure\n\nfacing different consequences, is arbitrary and further the provision\n\nsuffers from serious vagueness.     The other aspect which has been\n\nseriously pyramided by the learned counsel for the appellants pertains\n\nto transfer of cases to the Special Court once declaration is made.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">100.      Learned counsel for the State has also referred to the rules\n\nto show that to avoid any kind of confusion a definition has been\n\nintroduced in the rules. It is obligatory to make it immediately clear\n\nthat the argument of the State that by virtue of bringing in a set of\n\nrules defining the term “high public or political office” takes away the\n\nprovision from the realm of challenge of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_381\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution\n\nis not correct. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"986214\" id=\"span_197\">In this regard Mr. Vinoo Bhagat, learned counsel for the\n\nappellants, has drawn our attention to the authority in <a href=\"/doc/986214/\" id=\"a_382\">Hotel Balaji\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_198\">                                   90</span>\n\fand Others v.

In the said case, a\n\nquestion arose as to how far it is permissible to refer to the rules made\n\nin an Act while judging the legislative competency of a legislature to\n\nenact a particular provision. In that context, the majority speaking\n\nthrough Ranganathan, J. observed that a subordinate legislation\n\ncannot travel beyond the purview of the Act. The learned Judge noted\n\nthat where the Act says that rules on being made shall be deemed “as\n\nif enacted in this Act”, the position may be different. Thereafter, the\n\nlearned Judge said that where the Act does not say so, the rules do\n\nnot become a part of the Act.      A passage from Halsbury’s Laws of\n\nEngland (3rd Edn.) Vol.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1644913\" id=\"span_199\">36 at page 401 was referred to.

Union of India49</a>, a dissenting\n\nopinion was pressed into service. The larger Bench dealing with the\n\nsaid submission expressed the view:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">       “... Shri Mehta points out further that Section 86 which\n       confers the rule-making power upon the Government does\n       not say that the rules when made shall be treated as if\n       enacted in the Act. Being a rule made by the Government, he\n       says, Rule 42-E can be deleted, amended or modified at any\n       time. In such a situation, the legislative competence of a\n       legislature to enact a particular provision in the Act cannot\n       be made to depend upon the rule or rules, as the case may\n       be, obtaining at a given point of time, he submits. We are\n       inclined to agree with the learned counsel. His submission\n       appears to represent the correct principle in matters where\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_200\">48</span>\n     1993 Supp (4) SCC 536\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_201\">49</span>\n     AIR 1970 SC 1173\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">                                    91</span>\n\f       the legislative competence of a legislature to enact a\n       particular provision arises. If so, the very foundation of the\n       appellants’ argument collapses.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_116\">101.        From the aforesaid, it is crystal clear that unless the Act\n\nprovides that the rules if deemed as enacted in the Act, a provision of\n\nthe rule cannot be read as a part of     the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"986214\" id=\"span_203\">102.        In the instant case, Section 24 lays down that the State\n\nGovernment may, by notification, make such rules, if any, as it may\n\ndeem necessary for carrying out the purposes of this Act. The said\n\nprovision is not akin to what has been referred to in the case in <a href=\"/doc/986214/\" id=\"a_384\">Hotel\n\nBalaji</a> (supra). True it is<a href=\"/doc/986214/\" id=\"a_385\">, <a href=\"/doc/986214/\" id=\"a_386\">the said decision</a></a> was rendered in the case\n\nof legislative competence but it has been cited to highlight that unless\n\nthe condition as mentioned therein is satisfied, rules cannot be treated\n\nas a part of the Act. Thus analysed, the submission of the learned\n\ncounsel for the State that the Rules have clarified the position and\n\nthat dispels the apprehension of exercise of arbitrary power, does not\n\ndeserve acceptance.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\">103.        Having not accepted the aforesaid submission, we shall\n\nproceed to deal with the real thrust of the submission on this score.

In the Special Courts Bill, 1978 (supra), may it be noted,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">                                    92</span>\n\fthe President of India had made a reference to this Court under <a href=\"/doc/4015076/\" id=\"a_387\">Article\n\n143(1)</a> of the Constitution for consideration of the question whether\n\nthe Special Courts Bill, 1978 (or any of its other provisions) if enacted\n\nwould be constitutionally invalid. The Court referred to the text of the\n\npreamble. The preamble of the Bill was meant to provide for trial of a\n\ncertain class of offences. Clause 4 of the Act which is relevant for the\n\npresent purpose, provided that if the Central Government is of the\n\nopinion that there is prima facie evidence of the commission of an\n\noffence alleged to have been committed during the period mentioned in\n\nthe Preamble by a person who held high public or political office in\n\nIndia and that in accordance with the guidelines contained in the\n\nPreamble, the said offence ought to be dealt with under the Act, the\n\nCentral Government shall make a declaration to that effect in every\n\ncase in which it is of the aforesaid opinion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_120\">105.       It was contended that <a href=\"/doc/1182345/\" id=\"a_388\">Section 4(1)</a> furnished no guidance\n\nfor making the declaration for deciding who one and for what reasons\n\nshould be sent up for trial to the Special Courts. The Court referred to\n\nthe various statutes with regard to classification and the concept of\n\nguidance and vagueness and opined that:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">       “... By clause 5 of the Bill, only those offences can be tried\n       by the Special Courts in respect of which the Central\n       Government has made a declaration under clause 4(1). That\n       declaration can be made by the Central Government only if\n       it is of the opinion that there is prima facie evidence of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">                                    93</span>\n\f       commission of an offence, during the period mentioned in\n       the preamble, by a person who held a high public or\n       political office in India and that, in accordance with the\n       guide-lines contained in the Preamble to the Bill, the said\n       offence ought to be dealt with under the Act. The\n       classification which <a href=\"/doc/1182345/\" id=\"a_389\">Section 4(1)</a> thus makes is both of\n       offences and offenders, the former in relation to the period\n       mentioned in the preamble that is to say, from February 27,\n       1975 until the expiry of the proclamation of emergency\n       dated June 25, 1975 and in relation to the objective\n       mentioned in the sixth para of the preamble that it is\n       imperative for the functioning of parliamentary democracy\n       and the institutions created by or under the Constitution of\n       India that the commission of such offences should be\n       judicially determined with the utmost dispatch; and the\n       latter in relation to their status, that is to say, in relation to\n       the high public or political office held by them in India. It is\n       only if both of these factors co-exist that the prosecution in\n       respect of the offences committed by the particular offenders\n       can be instituted in the Special Court.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_121\">106.        Thereafter,   the   Court    referred   to   certain   periods   as\n\nmentioned in the preamble and in that context, opined that:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">       “... But persons possessing widely differing characteristic, in\n       the context of their situation in relation to the period of their\n       activities, cannot by any reasonable criterion be herded in\n       the same class. The antedating of the emergency, as it were,\n       from June 25 to February 27, 1975 is wholly unscientific\n       and proceeds from irrational considerations arising out of a\n       supposed discovery in the matter of screening of offenders.\n       The inclusion of offences and offenders in relation to the\n       period from February 27 to June 25, 1975 in the same class\n       as those whose alleged unlawful activities covered the period\n       of emergency is too artificial to be sustained.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\">107.        The Court recorded its conclusion in paragraph 120 as\n\nfollows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">       “The Objects and Reasons are informative material guiding\n       the court about the purpose of a legislation and the nexus of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">                                        94</span>\n\f       the differentia, if any, to the end in view. Nothing about\n       Emergency period is adverted to there as a distinguishing\n       mark. If at all, the clear clue is that all abuse of public\n       authority by exalted public men, whatever the time of\n       commission, shall be punished without the tedious delay\n       which ordinarily defeats justice in the case of top echelons\n       whose crimes affect the credentials of democratic regimes.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">108.        In this context, reference may be made to V.C. Shukla\n\n(supra) upon which heavy reliance has been placed by the State\n\nGovernment. The appellants therein while challenging the conviction\n\nraised a number of preliminary objections including constitutional\n\nvalidity of the <a href=\"/doc/701797/\" id=\"a_390\">Special Courts Act</a> [No. 22 of 1979] on several grounds,\n\nincluding contravention of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_391\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_392\">21</a> of the Constitution. A\n\nthree-Judge Bench referred to the order passed in the reference made\n\nby the President of India under <a href=\"/doc/4015076/\" id=\"a_393\">Article 143(1)</a> of the Constitution\n\nwherein majority of the provisions in the Bill were treated to be valid.\n\nThereafter, the Bill ultimately got the assent of the President with\n\ncertain changes.    <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_394\">After the Act</a> came into force, it assumed      a new\n\ncomplexion.     The Court in the latter judgment referred to clauses in\n\nthe preamble and scanned the anatomy of the Act. It was contended\n\nthat regard being had to the principles laid down by this Court in the\n\nSpecial Courts Bill, 1978 (supra) the provisions fail to pass the test\n\nof valid classification under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_395\">Article 14</a>, for the classification which\n\ndistinguishes persons who are placed in a group from others who are\n\nleft out of the group is not based on intelligible differentia; that there\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">                                   95</span>\n\fwas no nexus between the differentiation which was the basis of the\n\nclassification and the object of the Act; and that such differentiation\n\ndid not have any rational relation to the object sought to be achieved\n\nby the Act. The Court reading the opinion in the Special Courts Bill,\n\n1978 (supra) did not agree with the submissions of the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellants that this Court had held that unless\n\nemergency offenders could be punished under the <a href=\"/doc/701797/\" id=\"a_396\">Special Courts Act</a>\n\nand that no Act seeking to punish the offences of a special type not\n\nrelated to the emergency would be hit by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_397\">Article 14.</a> The Court\n\naddressed to the validity of <a href=\"/doc/1902247/\" id=\"a_398\">Sections 5</a>, <a href=\"/doc/654149/\" id=\"a_399\">6</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1304459/\" id=\"a_400\">7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/347123/\" id=\"a_401\">11</a> of the Special\n\nCourts Act, 1979. One of the arguments advanced was that neither\n\nthe words ‘high public or political office’ had been defined nor the\n\noffence being delineated so as to make the prosecution of such\n\noffenders a practical reality. Dealing with the said contention, the\n\nCourt held:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">    “24. As regards the definition of “high public or political\n    office” the expression is of well-known significance and bears\n    a clear connotation which admits of no vagueness or\n    ambiguity. Even during the debate in Parliament, it was not\n    suggested that the expression suffered from any vagueness.\n    Apart from that even in the Reference case Krishna Iyer, J.\n    referred to holders of such offices thus : (SCC pp. 440, 441,\n    paras 107, 111)\n    “… heavy-weight criminaloids who often mislead the people\n    by public moral weight-lifting and multi point manifestoes. . .\n    such super-offenders in top positions.... No erudite pedantry\n    can stand in the way of pragmatic grouping of high-placed\n    office holders separately, for purposes of high-speed criminal\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">                                  96</span>\n\f       action invested with early conclusiveness and inquired into\n       by high-level courts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">       25. It is manifest from the observations of Krishna Iyer, J.,\n       that persons holding high public or political offices mean\n       persons holding top positions wielding large powers.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_124\">109.        Thereafter,   the   three-Judge      Bench      referred    to   the\n\ndescription of persons holding high public or political office in\n\nAmerican Jurisprudence (2d, Vol. 63, pp. 626, 627 and 637) Ferris in\n\nhis Thesis on “Extraordinary Legal Remedies”, Wade and Phillips in\n\n“Constitutional    Law”   and   after     referring   to   various     meanings\n\nattributed to the words ruled:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">       “28. A perusal of the observations made in the various\n       textbooks referred to above clearly shows that “political\n       office” is an office which forms part of a political department\n       of the Government or the political executive. This, therefore,\n       clearly includes Cabinet Ministers, Ministers, Deputy\n       Ministers and Parliamentary Secretaries who are running\n       the Department formulating policies and are responsible to\n       the Parliament. The word High is indication of a top position\n       and enabling the holder thereof to take major policy\n       decisions. Thus, the term “high public or political office”\n       used in the Act contemplates only a special class of officers\n       or politicians who may be categorised as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">       “(1) officials wielding extraordinary powers entitling them to\n       take major policy decisions and holding positions of trust\n       and answerable and accountable for their wrongs;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">       (2) persons responsible for giving to the State a clean, stable\n       and honest administration;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">       (3) persons occupying a very elevated status in whose hands\n       lies the destiny of the nation.”\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_209\">                                     97</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_116\">\f       29. The rationale behind the classification of persons\n       possessing the aforesaid characteristics is that they wield\n       wide powers which, if exercised improperly by reason of\n       corruption, nepotism or breach of trust, may mar or\n       adversely mould the future of the country and tarnish its\n       image. It cannot be said, therefore, with any conviction that\n       persons who possess special attributes could be equated\n       with ordinary criminals who have neither the power nor the\n       resources to commit offences of the type described above. We\n       are, therefore, satisfied that the term “persons holding high\n       public or political offices” is self-explanatory and admits of\n       no difficulty and that mere absence of definition of the\n       expression would not vitiate the classification made by the\n       Act. Such persons are in a position to take major decisions\n       regarding social, economic, financial aspect of the life of the\n       community and other far-reaching decisions on the home\n       front as also regarding external affairs and if their actions\n       are tainted by breach of trust, corruption or other\n       extraneous considerations, they would damage the interests\n       of the country. It is, therefore, not only proper but essential\n       to bring such offenders to book at the earliest possible\n       opportunity.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">110.        After so stating, the Court referred to clause 4        of the\n\npreamble and opined thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_117\">       “31. The words “powers being a trust” clearly indicate that\n       any act which amounts to a breach of the trust or of the\n       powers conferred on the person concerned would be an\n       offence triable under the Act. Clause (4) is wide enough to\n       include any offence committed by holders of high public or\n       political offices which amounts to breach of trust or for\n       which they are accountable in law and does not leave any\n       room for doubt. Mr Bhatia, however, submitted that even if\n       the person concerned commits a petty offence like violation\n       of municipal bye-laws or traffic rules he would have to be\n       prosecuted under the Act which will be seriously prejudicial\n       to him. In our opinion, this argument is purely illusory and\n       based on a misconception of the provisions of the Act.\n       <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_402\">Section 5</a> which confers powers on the Central Government\n       to make a declaration clearly refers to the guidelines laid\n       down in the preamble and no Central Government would\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_210\">                                     98</span>\n\f       ever think of prosecuting holders of high public or political\n       offices for petty offences and the doubt expressed by the\n       counsel for the appellant is, therefore, totally unfounded.”\n\n       In view of the aforesaid enunciation of law, we are unable to\n\naccept the submission of the learned counsel for the appellants that\n\nthe words “high public or political office” not being defined, creates a\n\ndent in the provision.     The said words, we are absolutely certain,\n\nconvey a category of public servants which is well understood and\n\nthere is no room for arbitrariness.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_126\">111.        The next aspect of challenge pertains to the classification\n\nmade by the legislature in respect of the accused persons facing trial\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_403\">Section 13(a)</a> to (d) and the accused persons under <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_404\">Section\n\n13(1)(e)</a>.   It is urged by the learned counsel for the appellants that\n\nthere is no intelligible differentia for making such a classification qua\n\nthe offence and moreover by adopting a rigorous procedure.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">112.        First, we shall advert to the class of offence and the persons.\n\nIt is submitted by Mr. Vinoo Bhagat, learned counsel appearing for\n\nsome of the appellants, that when a person holding public office is\n\naccused of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_405\">Section 13(1)(a)</a> to (d), he will be tried by\n\nthe Special Courts under the 1988 Act, but when <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_406\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> is\n\ncombined along with other offences, namely, <a href=\"/doc/1318379/\" id=\"a_407\">Section 7</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1988748/\" id=\"a_408\">11</a> of the\n\n1988 Act, he will be facing the trial under the Orissa Act or two trials.\n\nMr. P.S. Narasimha, learned senior counsel, would contend that the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_211\">                                      99</span>\n\fbifurcation of offences defeats the concept of classification, for it\n\npertains to a “stand alone offence”, though no discernable principle is\n\nperceptible. Learned senior counsel would contend that there is no\n\ndifference between <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_409\">Section 13(1)(a)</a> to (d) and <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_410\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the\n\n1988 Act, but the legislature has made a special classification which\n\nthe law does not countenance. It is also canvassed that a person not\n\nholding high public or political office would be tried by the Special\n\nJudge under the 1988 Act, whereas the differentiated category will be\n\ntried by the Orissa Act as a consequence of which an unacceptable\n\ndiscrimination takes place. It is contended that the only basis of\n\nclassification for choosing a different forum with a different procedure\n\nis that the accused persons held ‘high public or high political office’\n\nthough there can be cases where holders of low public office can\n\namass assets by illegal means but they would not be liable to face\n\nconfiscation proceedings as provided under the Orissa Act. It has been\n\nargued that the classification is not to be done on the basis of post\n\nwhich a public servant holds.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">113.      We have already referred to the term “offence”. The Orissa\n\nAct defines the offence to make it come within the compartment of\n\nClause (e) of sub-<a href=\"/doc/1658551/\" id=\"a_411\">section 1</a> of <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_412\">Section 13</a> of the 1988 Act.          The\n\nsubmission on behalf of the learned counsel for the appellants is that\n\nthe classification is arbitrary, unwarranted and unjustified as there is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_212\">                                  100</span>\n\fno rationale behind it. Learned counsel have referred to the offences\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1318379/\" id=\"a_413\">Sections 7</a>, <a href=\"/doc/449543/\" id=\"a_414\">8</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1080526/\" id=\"a_415\">9</a> and <a href=\"/doc/290623/\" id=\"a_416\">12</a> of the 1988 Act. The said offences relate\n\nto different situations, whereas <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_417\">Section 13</a> deals with criminal\n\nmisconduct by a public servant. The said provision reads as follows:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_118\">     “<a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_418\">Section 13</a>.

The submission of Mr. Narasimha, learned senior counsel\n\nand others, as we have referred to earlier, is that it is a micro-mini\n\nclassification and classification is on the base of a stand alone offence\n\nor to put it differently, it is a classification qua a singular class. It is\n\nto be noted that <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_419\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> has its own significance in the context\n\nof the range of offences provided under the 1988 Act. <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_420\">Section 13(1)(e)</a>\n\ncovers a period which is called check period. It pertains to amassing\n\nof disproportionate assets. The condition precedent is that accused is\n\nprima facie found in possession of disproportionate properties or\n\npossessing resources not known to his sources of income.               It is\n\nobligatory on the part of the accused in that case to explain his\n\nsources, which has been the basis for accumulating the assets which\n\nare alleged to be disproportionate. The offences under <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_421\">Section 13(1) (a)</a>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_214\">                                    102</span>\n\fto (d) in a broad way can be called incident specific or situation\n\nspecific whereas the offence under <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_422\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> is period specific\n\nand it is not incident specific. There can be different check periods. A\n\nperson holding high public office or political office has opportunities to\n\naccumulate disproportionate assets other than his known sources of\n\nincome.    It has been submitted by the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants that disproportionate assets can be accumulated by the\n\npersons working in the lesser rank or not holding such high offices.\n\nThis submission is noted only to be rejected, for the holders of high\n\npost or high public office do definitely enjoy a distinguished position in\n\ncontrast to other categories of officers or post holders. They form a\n\nseparate class. The legislature, regard being had to the position the\n\npublic servant holds, has put them in a different class.      There is a\n\nmanifest reason that sustains the said classification. The contention\n\nof the learned counsel for the appellants is that the provision suffers\n\nbecause of under-inclusive classification but the same does not\n\nimpress us as in the instant case we are disposed to think that there\n\nis a perceptible differentia in such exclusion. The court cannot adopt\n\nan attitude to scrutinize a provision with mathematical exactitude. A\n\npedantic approach in this regard cannot be visualized. Learned\n\ncounsel for the State of Odisha would submit that the distinction is\n\nwrit large and the legislature in its wisdom has carved out the offence\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_215\">                                   103</span>\n\fof <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_423\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> to be tried by Special Courts in a speedy manner. It\n\nis urged by him that the onus is on the accused to prove that the asset\n\nis not disproportionate and within the known sources of his income.\n\nHe has drawn inspiration from P. Nallamal v. Inspector of Police50,\n\nwherein it has been held that the words “known sources of income”\n\nhave to be understood as “any lawful source”.              That apart, the\n\nexplanation to <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_424\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> further enjoins that receipt of such\n\nincome should have been intimated by the public servant in\n\naccordance with the provisions of any law applicable to such public\n\nservant at the relevant time.      Such a public servant cannot escape\n\nfrom <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_425\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the 1988 Act by showing other legally\n\nforbidden sources, albeit such sources are outside the purview of\n\nclauses (a) to (d) of the sub-section.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\">115.          Having so stated, we proceed to dwell upon the concept of\n\nclassification as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_426\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"685234\" id=\"span_216\">In\n\nthis regard, we may usefully refer to the authority in <a href=\"/doc/685234/\" id=\"a_427\">Ram Krishna\n\nDalmia v.

It is also well established by the\n       decisions of this Court that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_429\">Article 14</a> condemns\n       discrimination not only by a substantive law but also by a\n       law of procedure.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_134\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"685234\" id=\"span_220\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1703207\" id=\"span_221\">116.

That is why the legislature decided to enact\n       <a href=\"/doc/1182345/\" id=\"a_440\">Section 4(1)</a> with a view to require the raising of the\n       statutory presumption as soon as the condition precedent\n       prescribed by it in that behalf is satisfied. The object which\n       the legislature thus wanted to achieve is the eradication of\n       corruption from amongst public servants, and between the\n       said object and the intelligible differentia on which the\n       classification is based there is a rational and direct relation.\n       We have, therefore, no hesitation in holding that the\n       challenge to the vires of <a href=\"/doc/1182345/\" id=\"a_441\">Section 4(1)</a> on the ground that it\n       violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_442\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution must fail.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">119.         While dealing with this facet, it would not be inappropriate\n\nto advert to certain passages from the concurring opinion of V.R.\n\nKrishna Iyer, J. in the Special Courts Bill, 1978 (supra) which reads\n\nas under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">       “105.

I lend judicious assent to the broader policy\n       of social justice behind this Bill. As I read it, this measure is\n       the embryonic expression of a necessitous legislative project,\n       which, if full-fledged, will work a relentless break-through\n       towards catching, through the compulsive criminal process,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_229\">54</span>\n     AIR 1960 SC 548\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_230\">                                      107</span>\n\f       the higher inhabitants of Indian public and political decks,\n       who have, in practice, remained “untouchable” and\n       “unapproachable” to the rule of law. “Operation Clean-Up” is\n       a “consummation devoutly to be wished”, although naive\n       optimism cannot obfuscate the obnoxious experience that\n       laws made in terrorem against those who belong to the top\n       power bloc prove in action to be paper tigers. The pathology\n       of our public law, with its class slant, is that an unmincing\n       ombudsman or sentinel on the qui vive, with power to act\n       against those in power, now or before, and offering legal\n       access to the informed citizen to complain with immunity\n       does not exist, despite all the bruited umbrage of political\n       performers against peculations and perversions by higher\n       echelons. Law is what law does, not what law says and the\n       moral gap between word and deed menaces peopled faith in\n       life and law. And then, the tragedy — democracy becomes a\n       casualty.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">       111. No erudite pedantry can stand in the way of pragmatic\n       grouping of high-placed office-holders separately, for\n       purposes of high-speed criminal action invested with early\n       conclusiveness and inquired into by high-level courts. This\n       differentia of the Bill rings irresistibly sound. And failure to\n       press forward such clean-up undertaking may be a blow to\n       the rule of law and the Rule of life and may deepen the crisis\n       of democracy among the millions — the men who make our\n       nation — who today are largely disenchanted. So it is time, if\n       peaceful transformation is the constitutional scheme, to\n       begin by pre-emptive steps of quick and conclusive exposure\n       and conviction of criminals in towers of power — a special\n       class of economic offenders with abettors from the\n       Bureaucracy and Big Business, as recent Commission\n       Reports trendily portray and portent. Such is the simple,\n       sociological substance of the classificatory discrimen which\n       satisfies the egalitarian conscience of Article 14.”\n                                                    [emphasis supplied]\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\">120.        From the abovestated ratiocination, it is quite evincible that\n\nthere is a difference, a demonstrable one, between the offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_443\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> and the rest of the offences enumerated in <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_444\">Section 13</a>.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_231\">                                     108</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_445\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> targets the persons who have disproportionate assets\n\nto their known sources of income.         This conceptually is a period\n\noffence, for it is not incident specific as such. It does not require proof\n\nof corruption in specific acts, but has reference to assets accumulated\n\nand known sources of income in a particular period.              The test\n\napplicable and proof required is different. That apart, in the context of\n\nthe present Orissa Act it is associated with high public office or with\n\npolitical office which are occupied by people who control the essential\n\ndynamics of power which can be a useful weapon to amass wealth\n\nadopting illegal means. In such a situation, the argument that they\n\nbeing put in a different class and tried in a separate special court\n\nsolely because the alleged offence, if nothing else, is a self-defeating\n\none. The submission that there is a sub-classification does not\n\nremotely touch the boundaries of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_446\">Article 14;</a> and certainly does not\n\nencroach thereon to invite its wrath of the equality clause.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_141\">121.      The controversy can be looked from another angle.            The\n\nspecial courts have been established on the basis of the law enacted\n\nby the State Legislature after obtaining the presidential assent. The\n\nlegislature has spelt out a policy for the purpose of establishing the\n\nSpecial Courts. It relates to an offence of special kind. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184660633\" id=\"span_232\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1908113\" id=\"span_233\">In this regard,\n\nreference to a Constitution Bench decision in <a href=\"/doc/1908113/\" id=\"a_447\">Kedar Nath Bajoria v.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_234\">                                   109</span>\n\fThe State of West Bengal55</a> may be usefully referred to.

The Court referred to the Act\n\nwhich was brought into existence to provide for the more speedy trial\n\nand more effective punishment of certain offences. The Court while\n\ndealing with the equal protection of law guaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_449\">Article 14</a> of the\n\nConstitution observed that there is a system which is brought into by\n\nintroducing Special Courts dealing with special types of offences under\n\na shortened and simplified procedure. The legislation is based on\n\nperfect intelligible principles of differentia having a clear and\n\nreasonable relation with the object sought to be achieved. The Court\n\nfurther observed that whether an enactment providing for a special\n\nprocedure for trial of certain offences is or is not discriminatory and\n\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_450\">Article 14</a> must be determined in each case as it arises, for,\n\nno general rule applicable to all cases can safely be laid down. It has\n\nbeen further ruled that practical assessment of operation of the law in\n\nthe particular circumstances is necessary.</span></span>      We may state that the\n\nCourt took note of the fact that in Kathi Raning Rawat v.

The next submission advanced by the learned counsel for\n\nthe appellants pertains to the issue that the corruption is an all India\n\nphenomenon and persons in other States are prosecuted under the\n\n1988 Act, whereas in the State of Odisha, they are tried in a more\n\nrigorous manner. It is submitted that the same brings in inequality\n\nwhich causes discomfort to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_456\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. We have\n\nalready held that as the assent of the President under <a href=\"/doc/665535/\" id=\"a_457\">Article 254(2)</a> of\n\nthe Constitution has been obtained and the assent is valid in law, the\n\nState law will operate.    <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_458\">Article 14</a> comes into play where equals are\n\ntreated as unequals.      The persons holding high public or political\n\noffice in the State of Odisha are governed by the Orissa Act. The State\n\nlegislature has passed the Orissa Act having regard to the obtaining\n\nsituation in the State as the objects and reasons of the said Act do\n\nreflect. The legislature in its wisdom has enacted the law. The persons\n\nwho are functioning in certain other States may be required to face\n\ntrial under the 1988 Act, but on that score there can be no violation of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_244\">                                    112</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_459\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"649393\" id=\"span_245\">The scale suggested, cannot be the\n\nscale to judge. A legislation passed by one State legislature cannot be\n\nequated with the legislation passed by another State legislature. Nor\n\ncan its validity be tested on that foundation. The Constitution bench\n\njudgment in <a href=\"/doc/649393/\" id=\"a_460\">The State of Madhya Pradesh v. G.C. Mandawar60</a> long\n\nback had succinctly clarified the position in this regard laying down\n\nthus:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">          “The power of the Court to declare a law void under\n          <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_461\">Article 13</a> has to be exercised with reference to the\n          specific legislation which is impugned. It is conceivable\n          that when the same legislature enacts two different laws\n          but in substance they form one legislation, it might be\n          open to the Court to disregard the form and treat them as\n          one law and strike it down, if in their conjunction they\n          result in discrimination. But such a course is not open\n          where, as here, the two laws sought to be read in\n          conjunction are by different Governments and by\n          different legislatures. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_462\">Article 14</a> does not authorise the\n          striking down of a law of one State on the ground that in\n          contrast with a law of another State on the same subject\n          its provisions are discriminatory. Nor does it contemplate\n          a law of the Centre or of the State dealing with similar\n          subjects being held to be unconstitutional by a process of\n          comparative study of the provisions of the two\n          enactments.

Now, we shall advert to the challenge relating to the\n\ngrievance which is fundamentally twin in nature.

It is urged that the provisions violate <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_465\">Article 14</a><a href=\"/doc/17858/\" id=\"a_466\">, 20(2)</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_467\">21</a> of the Constitution.

The said provisions, as has been stated earlier, have been\n\nattacked from two angles.      The first one, these provisions violate\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_479\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/17858/\" id=\"a_480\">, 20(2)</a><a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_481\">, 20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_482\">21</a> of the Constitution. The second limb of\n\nsubmission is with regard to the accused persons who had been facing\n\ntrial under the 1988 Act prior to coming into force of the Orissa Act as\n\na result of the transfer of case, are compelled to face harsher penalty\n\nthan what was provided at the time of commission of the alleged\n\noffence. Structuring the first submission, it is contended that\n\nreasonableness of pre-trial confiscation of a person’s property before\n\nhe has been found guilty makes the provision unjust, unfair and\n\narbitrary. That apart, it being a punishment, the accused cannot be\n\nallowed to face double jeopardy. Additionally, it is contended that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_483\">Section 13</a> confers the power on the State Government to authorise\n\nthe Public Prosecutor for making the application to the authorised\n\nofficer for confiscation of money and other property under the Orissa\n\nAct, if the State Government believes that the said person to have been\n\nprocured by means of the offence. The criticism advanced as regards\n\nthe said provision is that unbridled and unrestricted power is\n\nconferred on the State Government to form an opinion. We have\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_253\">                                  117</span>\n\fexpressed our opinion with regard to formation of opinion as regards\n\nthe prima facie case in the context of <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_484\">Section 5</a> of the Act. The said\n\nprinciples are applicable to <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_485\">Section 13</a>.        What is required to be\n\nscrutinized by the State Government that the offence exists under\n\nSection 13(1)(e) of the Orissa Act and thereafter it has to authorise the\n\nPublic Prosecutor to make an application. The submission of the\n\nlearned counsel for the appellants that the Public Prosecutor has no\n\nrole. We are not adverting to the role of the Public Prosecutor that has\n\nbeen conferred on him under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_486\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> nor is it\n\nnecessary to dwell upon, how this Court has time and again dwelt\n\nupon the role of the Public Prosecutor. It is because the application\n\nthat is required to be filed in sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_487\">Section 13</a> itself\n\npostulates the guidelines. The application has to be accompanied by\n\nan affidavit stating the grounds on which the belief as regards the\n\ncommission of the offence and the amount of money and many other\n\naspects. An application has to be filed by the Public Prosecutor. The\n\nPublic Prosecutor before he files an application under sub-section (1)\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_488\">Section 13</a>, is required to be first satisfied with regard to the aspects\n\nenumerated in sub-section (2). Sub-section (2) obliges the Public\n\nProsecutor that requirements are satisfied for filing the application. In\n\nview of the said position, it cannot be said that there is lack of\n\nguidance. It is not that the authority has the discretion to get an\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_254\">                                   118</span>\n\fapplication filed through the Public Prosecutor or not. It is not that a\n\nmere discretion is left to the Public Prosecutor. The authority has only\n\nbeen authorised to scrutinize the offence and authorise the Public\n\nProsecutor and thereafter the Public Prosecutor has been conferred\n\nthe responsibility which is manifestly detailed, and definitely guided,\n\nto file the application. Thus scrutinized, the said provision does not\n\noffend <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_489\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_158\">128.        Having said about the guidance, we would like to make it\n\nclear that the word “may” used in <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_490\">Section 13</a> has to be understood in\n\nits context. It does not really relate to authorization of filing. To clarify\n\nthat the authority does not have the discretionary power to authorise\n\nfor filing against some and refrain from authorizing in respect of the\n\nother,     it has to be construed that the said word relates to the\n\npurpose, that is, the application to be filed for the purpose of\n\nconfiscation.    This is in consonance with the legislative policy, the\n\nscheme of the Act and also the objects and reasons of the Act. The\n\nlegislative policy, as declared, clearly indicates that there should not\n\nbe any kind of discretion with the Government in these kinds of\n\nmatters.        The fulcrum of the policy, as is discernible, is that\n\ndelinquent officers having disproportionate assets coming within the\n\npurview of <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_491\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> have to face the confiscation proceedings\n\nsubject to judicial scrutiny as the rest of the provisions do unveil.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_255\">                                    119</span>\n\fLearned counsel for the appellants would contend that the legislature\n\nhas delegated such power on the authority which can act in an\n\nindiscriminate manner. The said submission in the context of this Act,\n\nis sans substance as we have already opined that there is no\n\ndiscretion to pick and choose but to see the minimum requirement,\n\nthat is, the offence and the status. Nothing beyond that.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_159\">129.      <a href=\"/doc/594381/\" id=\"a_492\">Sections 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1405209/\" id=\"a_493\">15</a> have been criticized on the ground that\n\nthey introduce concept of pre-trial confiscation. As indicated earlier,\n\nthe submission is pyramided on the principle that the provisions are\n\nviolative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_494\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/17858/\" id=\"a_495\">, 20(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_496\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\nApart from this,    the other assail is that they have been made\n\nretrospectively applicable because the cases of accused persons\n\npending before the Special Courts under the 1988 Act are transferred\n\nand they are compelled to face the confiscation proceedings and\n\nfurther consequence thereof, which is not permissible in the\n\nconstitutional scheme.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_160\">130.      First we shall deal with the first attack. <a href=\"/doc/594381/\" id=\"a_497\">Section 14</a> requires\n\nthe person in respect of whom the application is made to indicate his\n\nsource of income, earnings or assets out of which he has acquired\n\nsuch money or property. He is entitled to adduce evidence on which\n\nhe wants to place reliance and is also entitled to furnish other relevant\n\ninformation. <a href=\"/doc/1405209/\" id=\"a_498\">Section 15</a> confers jurisdiction on the Authorised Officer\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_256\">                                  120</span>\n\fto consider the explanation and the material available before it and\n\nproceed to record a finding whether all or any other money or\n\nproperties in question have been acquired illegally. He is statutorily\n\nrequired to offord reasonable opportunity of being heard to the affected\n\nperson. He is obliged under the law to declare that such money or\n\nproperty or both shall stand confiscated free from all encumbrances.\n\nSub-<a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_499\">section 5</a> of <a href=\"/doc/1405209/\" id=\"a_500\">Section 15</a> stipulates that the proceeding for\n\nconfiscation shall be disposed of within a period of six months from\n\nthe date of notice issued under sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/594381/\" id=\"a_501\">Section 14</a>.      The\n\norder of confiscation as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1405209/\" id=\"a_502\">Section 15(6)</a> is subject to\n\nappeal. Mr. R.K. Dash, learned senior counsel appearing for some of\n\nthe appellants would contend that it is a draconian law taking the\n\nsociety back to the dark days. The provisions are criticized that once\n\na confiscation takes place free from all encumbrances, the right, title\n\nand interest to the property or the money gets extinguished.       It is\n\nurged that same cannot be done without a proper trial.         Learned\n\ncounsel for the State would lay emphasis on the ill-gotten wealth. He\n\nhas referred to an extract of the 160th Law Commission Report. We\n\nhave been commended to certain judgments of this Court that spoke\n\nof corruption at high places. The issue that has really emanated for\n\nconsideration is whether there can be an interim confiscation when\n\nthe trial is pending.   It is argued with vehemence by the learned\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_257\">                                  121</span>\n\fcounsel for the appellants that it is “forfeiture” of property and it\n\ncannot be imposed without a trial. In this context, reference has been\n\nmade to <a href=\"/doc/543586/\" id=\"a_503\">Section 53</a> of the Indian Penal Code which provides forfeiture\n\nof property as a punishment.              It is also canvassed that the\n\nnomenclature would not make any difference when the impact\n\ntantamounts to a punishment. Emphasis is laid on the words “vest\n\nfree from      all encumbrances” to       highlight that in its normal\n\nconnotation, it would only mean that it shall stand transferred to the\n\nState.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_161\">131.         Regard being had to the aforesaid submissions,             it is\n\nabsolutely essential to understand the concept of confiscation.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1815080\" id=\"span_258\">In\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1815080/\" id=\"a_504\">Maqbool Hussain v. State of Bombay</a> 62 the Constitution Bench was\n\ndealing with the issue whether the confiscation by the customs\n\nauthorities is a punishment. Dealing with the said issue, the larger\n\nBench ruled:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">       “17. We are of the opinion that the Sea Customs authorities\n       are not a judicial tribunal and the adjudging of confiscation,\n       increased rate of duty or penalty under the provisions of the\n       Sea Customs Act do not constitute a judgment or order of a\n       court or judicial tribunal necessary for the purpose of\n       supporting a plea of double jeopardy.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">       18. It therefore follows that when the Customs authorities\n       confiscated the gold in question neither the proceedings\n       taken before the Sea Customs authorities constituted a\n       prosecution of the appellant nor did the order of confiscation\n       constitute a punishment inflicted by a court or judicial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_259\">62</span>\n     AIR 1953 SC 325\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_260\">                                    122</span>\n\f       tribunal on the appellant. The appellant could not be said by\n       reason of these proceedings before the Sea Customs\n       authorities to have been “prosecuted and punished” for the\n       same offence with which he was charged before the Chief\n       Presidency Magistrate, Bombay, in the complaint which was\n       filed against him under <a href=\"/doc/33962792/\" id=\"a_505\">Section 23</a> of the Foreign Exchange\n       Regulation Act.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_162\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1818703\" id=\"span_261\">132.         Learned counsel for the State has drawn our attention to\n\nanother Constitution Bench decision in the <a href=\"/doc/1818703/\" id=\"a_506\">State of West Bengal v.\n\nS.K. Ghosh63</a>.        The factual matrix in the said case was that the\n\nrespondent therein was appointed as the Chief Refugee Administrator\n\nof Burma Refugee Organisation and he was believed to have embezzled\n\nlarge sums of money belonging to Government which were at his\n\ndisposal.     The prosecution was initiated under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_507\">Sections 120-B</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_508\">409</a> of the Indian Penal Code before coming into force the Second\n\nSpecial Tribunal constituted under the Criminal Law Amendment\n\nOrdinance, No. 29 of 1943.                During the pendency of the case, the\n\nCriminal Law Amendment Ordinance 30 of 1944 was passed.                   The\n\nCourt took note of the fact that the object of the Ordinance was to\n\nprevent disposal or concealment of money or other property procured\n\nby means of certain scheduled offences punishable under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_509\">IPC</a> and\n\none of the offences to which the Ordinance applied was 409 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_510\">IPC</a> apart\n\nfrom other offences.         The respondent was convicted by the Special\n\nTribunal on August 31, 1949 by which Criminal Law (1943)\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_262\">63</span>\n     AIR 1963 SC 255 = 1963 (2) SCR 111\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_263\">                                           123</span>\n\fAmendment amending Ordinance No. 12 of 1945 had come into force.\n\nRelying on the said Ordinance, the Special Tribunal apart from\n\nimposing a substantial sentence of rigorous imprisonment for five\n\nyears, directed a fine of Rs. 45 lakhs to be paid on the charge of\n\nconspiracy. The respondent preferred an appeal before the High Court\n\nassailing his conviction and the High Court upheld the conviction and\n\nsentence of fine.   However, the High Court opined that the Special\n\nTribunal could have imposed the fine under the ordinary law but not\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/64392/\" id=\"a_511\">Section 10</a> of the 1943 Ordinance as amended in 1945\n\nprescribing minimum limit of fine. The respondent had approached\n\nthis Court in appeal which was dismissed on the ground that it was\n\nclear that Rs. 30 lakhs have been misappropriated by the respondent\n\nas a result of the conspiracy. On January 9, 1957, an application was\n\nmade to the District Judge under <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_512\">Section 13</a> of the 1944 Ordinance for\n\nconfiscation of the property.    The property stood attached under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_513\">Section 3</a> of the 1944 Ordinance.    The learned District Judge held on\n\na construction of <a href=\"/doc/290623/\" id=\"a_514\">Section 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/392223/\" id=\"a_515\">Section 13(3)</a> of the 1944 Ordinance\n\nthat the amount of Rs. 30 lakhs together with the cost of attachment\n\nhad first to be forfeited to the Union of India from the properties\n\nattached and thereafter the fine of Rs. 45 lakhs was to be recovered\n\nfrom the residue of the said attached property. However, as it was not\n\npossible to forfeit the properties to the value of Rs. 30 lakhs without\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_264\">                                   124</span>\n\fvaluation, the District Judge directed the receiver to report as to the\n\ncost of attachment including the cost of management of the property\n\nattached. He also directed the parties to submit their estimates as to\n\nthe value of the property attached. The said order was assailed by the\n\nrespondent in appeal and one of the Judges of the High Court opined\n\nthat the fine amount was recoverable and no proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_516\">Section\n\n13</a> could be taken for forfeiture of Rs. 30 lakhs, the embezzled amount\n\ninasmuch as no action could be taken under the Ordinance.          The\n\nother learned Judge opined that the District Judge had jurisdiction to\n\nforfeit properties worth Rs. 30 lakhs under <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_517\">Section 13</a> but he was of\n\nthe opinion that <a href=\"/doc/543586/\" id=\"a_518\">Section 53</a> of the IPC referred to forfeiture as\n\npunishment is distinct from fine and as the punishment of forfeiture\n\nas contemplated by the 1944 Ordinance had yet to take place, <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_519\">Article\n\n20(1)</a> of the Constitution would apply. The reason for coming to such\n\na conclusion was that 1944 Ordinance had come into force on August\n\n23, 1944, while the real and effective period during which the offence\n\nwas committed ended with July, 1944 and thereafter forfeiture was\n\nnot prescribed as a punishment before the 1944 Ordinance.         This\n\nCourt referred to <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_520\">Section 13</a> of the 1944 Ordinance which deals with\n\nthe disposal of attached property upon termination of criminal\n\nproceeding.   The court referred to <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_521\">Section 5</a> that provides for\n\ninvestigation of objection to attachment and the authority of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_265\">                                 125</span>\n\fDistrict Judge under sub-<a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_522\">section 3</a> of <a href=\"/doc/838793/\" id=\"a_523\">Section 5</a> to pass an order\n\nmaking the attachment absolute or varying it by releasing a portion of\n\nthe property from attachment or withdrawing the order. In the said\n\ncase, the District Judge had made the order absolute and the\n\nproperties had continued under attachment.      The Court referred to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_524\">Section 3</a> to opine that there are two kinds of properties which are to\n\nbe attached.    The first property which has been procured by the\n\ncommission of the offence, whether it be in the form of money or in the\n\nform of movable or immovable property, and second properties are\n\nother than the above.    The respondent in the said case had been\n\ncharged with embezzlement of money and that was why an application\n\nfor attachment under <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_525\">Section 3</a> was made that he had used the money\n\nprocured by commission of offence in purchasing certain properties.\n\nThe Court referred to <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_526\">Section 13</a> and ruled that the District Judge has\n\njurisdiction to deal with the property attached under <a href=\"/doc/1444093/\" id=\"a_527\">Section 38</a> for\n\nthe purpose of forfeiture provided <a href=\"/doc/290623/\" id=\"a_528\">Section 12</a> has been complied with.\n\nThereafter, the larger Bench adverted to <a href=\"/doc/1165606/\" id=\"a_529\">Section 12(1)</a> and in that\n\ncontext held that:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">     “.... The sub-section lays down that before the judgment is\n     pronounced by the court trying the offender and it is\n     represented to the court that an order of attachment of\n     property had been passed under <a href=\"/doc/1283441/\" id=\"a_530\">Section 3</a> in connection\n     with such offence, the court shall, if it is convicting the\n     accused, record a finding as to the amount of money or\n     value of other property procured by the accused by means of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_266\">                                 126</span>\n\f       the offence. Clearly all that <a href=\"/doc/1165606/\" id=\"a_531\">Section 12(1)</a> requires is that the\n       court trying the offender should be asked to record a finding\n       as to the amount of money or value of other property\n       procured by the accused before it by means of the offence for\n       which he is being tried. There is no procedure provided for\n       making the representation to the court to record a finding as\n       to the amount of money or value of other property procured\n       by the offence. In our view, all that <a href=\"/doc/1165606/\" id=\"a_532\">Section 12(1)</a> requires is\n       that at the request of the prosecution the court should give a\n       finding as to the amount of money or value of other property\n       procured by the accused. Representation may be by\n       application or even oral and so long as the court gives a\n       finding as to the amount of money or value of other property\n       procured by the offence that would in our opinion be\n       sufficient compliance with <a href=\"/doc/1165606/\" id=\"a_533\">Section 12(1)</a>. It is not necessary\n       that the court when it gives a finding as to the amount of\n       money or value of other property procured by means of the\n       offence should say in so many words in passing the order\n       that it is making that finding on a representation under\n       <a href=\"/doc/1165606/\" id=\"a_534\">Section 12(1)</a>. It is true that under <a href=\"/doc/64392/\" id=\"a_535\">Section 10</a> of the 1943\n       Ordinance as amended in 1945 the court when imposing a\n       fine has to give a finding as to the amount of money or value\n       of other property found to have been procured by the\n       offender by means of the offence in order that it may comply\n       with the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/64392/\" id=\"a_536\">Section 10</a> as to the minimum fine to\n       be imposed. We see no reason however why a finding given\n       for the purpose of <a href=\"/doc/64392/\" id=\"a_537\">Section 10</a> determining the amount of\n       money or the value of other property found to have been\n       procured by the offender by means of the offence should not\n       also be taken as a finding under <a href=\"/doc/1165606/\" id=\"a_538\">Section 12(1)</a> of the 1944\n       Ordinance. The result of the two findings in our opinion is\n       exactly the same, the only difference being that under\n       <a href=\"/doc/64392/\" id=\"a_539\">Section 10</a> of the 1943 Ordinance, as amended in 1945, the\n       court may do this suo moto while under <a href=\"/doc/1165606/\" id=\"a_540\">Section 12(1)</a> of the\n       1944 Ordinance it has to be done on the representation\n       made by the prosecution.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">133.        Thereafter the Court noted the reasoning of the other\n\nlearned Judge and opined that it was not necessary in the said appeal\n\nto decide whether the case would come within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_541\">Articles\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_267\">                                     127</span>\n\f20(1).</a> This opinion was expressed principally on the ground that the\n\nforfeiture provided under <a href=\"/doc/392223/\" id=\"a_542\">Section 13(3)</a> is not a penalty at all within\n\nthe meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_543\">Article 20(1).</a> In that context, the Court analyzed the\n\nprovisions of the 1944 Ordinance and came to hold that:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">     “....The forfeiture by the District Judge under <a href=\"/doc/392223/\" id=\"a_544\">Section 13(3)</a>\n     cannot in our opinion be equated to forfeiture of property\n     which is provided in <a href=\"/doc/543586/\" id=\"a_545\">Section 53</a> of the Indian Penal Code.\n     The forfeiture provided in <a href=\"/doc/1226956/\" id=\"a_546\">Section 53</a> is undoubtedly a\n     penalty or punishment within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_547\">Article 20(1);</a>\n     but that order of forfeiture has to be passed by the court\n     trying the offence, where there is a provision for forfeiture in\n     the section concerned in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_548\">Indian Penal Code</a>. There is\n     nothing however in the 1944 Ordinance to show that it\n     provides for any kind of punishment for any offence. Further\n     it is clear that the Court of District Judge which is a\n     Principal Court of Civil Jurisdiction can have no jurisdiction\n     to try an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_549\">Indian Penal Code</a>. The order of\n     forfeiture therefore by the District Judge under <a href=\"/doc/392223/\" id=\"a_550\">Section 13(3)</a>\n     cannot be equated to the infliction of a penalty within the\n     meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_551\">Article 20(1).</a> <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_552\">Article 20(1)</a> deals with conviction\n     of persons for offences and for subjection of them to\n     penalties. It provides firstly that “no person shall be\n     convicted of any offence except for violation of a law in force\n     at the time of the commission of the act charged as an\n     offence”. Secondly, it provides that no person shall be\n     “subjected to a penalty greater than that which might have\n     been inflicted under the law in force at the time of the\n     commission of the offence”. Clearly, therefore <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_553\">Article 20</a> is\n     dealing with punishment for offences and provides two\n     safeguards, namely, (i) that no one shall be punished for an\n     act which was not an offence under the law in force when it\n     was committed, and (ii) that no one shall be subjected to a\n     greater penalty for an offence than what was provided under\n     the law in force when the offence was committed. The\n     provision for forfeiture under <a href=\"/doc/392223/\" id=\"a_554\">Section 13(3)</a> has nothing to do\n     with the infliction of any penalty on any person for an\n     offence. If the forfeiture provided in <a href=\"/doc/392223/\" id=\"a_555\">Section 13(3)</a> were really\n     a penalty on a convicted person for commission of an offence\n     we should have found it provided in the 1943 Ordinance and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_268\">                                  128</span>\n\f       that penalty of forfeiture would have been inflicted by the\n       criminal court trying the offender.”\n                                               [emphasis is added]\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">134.          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1513039\" id=\"span_269\">In this context reference to authority in <a href=\"/doc/1513039/\" id=\"a_556\">Divisional Forest\n\nOfficer and another v.

The question that was posed by the\n\nCourt was whether where a Forest Officer makes a report of seizure of\n\nany timber of forest produce and produces the seized property along\n\nwith a report under <a href=\"/doc/1180616/\" id=\"a_558\">Section 44(2)</a> that he has reason to believe that a\n\nforest offence has been committed in respect of such timber or the\n\nforest produce seized, could there be simultaneous proceedings for\n\nconfiscation to the Government of such timber or forest produce and\n\nthe implements, etc., if the Authorized Officer under <a href=\"/doc/1852805/\" id=\"a_559\">Section 44(2A)</a> of\n\nthe Act is satisfied that a forest offence has been committed, along\n\nwith a criminal case instituted on a complaint by the Forest Officer\n\nbefore a Magistrate of the commission of a forest offence under <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_560\">Section\n\n20</a> of the Act.

The other issue that arose for consideration was\n\nwhether <a href=\"/doc/600270/\" id=\"a_567\">Section 10(1)</a> of FERA, 1947 was an independent provision\n\nmaking its contravention by itself punishable under <a href=\"/doc/424628/\" id=\"a_568\">Section 23(1)(a)</a> of\n\nFERA, 1947 or whether its contravention could arise only if there is a\n\nbreach of some directions issued by the Reserve Bank of India under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1477597/\" id=\"a_569\">Section 10(2)</a> of FERA, 1947. In the said case, the High Court had\n\nopined that <a href=\"/doc/424628/\" id=\"a_570\">Section 23</a> was a penal provision and the proceedings\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/424628/\" id=\"a_571\">Section 23(1)(a)</a> were quasi criminal in nature and therefore\n\nexistence of mens rea was a necessary ingredient for the commission\n\nof an offence under <a href=\"/doc/64392/\" id=\"a_572\">Section 10</a> of the Act. Dealing with the said facet\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_273\">65</span>\n     (1996) 2 SCC 471\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_274\">                                     130</span>\n\fthe Court expressed:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">     “The proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/424628/\" id=\"a_573\">Section 23(1)(a)</a> of FERA, 1947 are\n     ‘adjudicatory’ in nature and character are not “criminal\n     proceedings”. The officers of the Enforcement Directorate\n     and other administrative authorities are expressly\n     empowered by the Act to ‘adjudicate’ only. Indeed they have\n     to act ‘judicially’ and follow the rules of natural justice to the\n     extent applicable but, they are not ‘Judges’ of the ‘Criminal\n     Courts’ trying an ‘accused’ for commission of an offence, as\n     understood in the general context.               They perform\n     quasi-judicial functions and do not act as ‘courts’ by only as\n     ‘administrators’ and ‘adjudicators’. In the proceedings before\n     them, they do not try ‘an accused’ for commission of “any\n     crime” (not merely an offence) but determine the liability of\n     the contravener for the breach of his ‘obligations’ imposed\n     under the Act. They impose ‘penalty’ for the breach of the\n     “civil obligations” laid down under the Act and not impose\n     any ‘sentence’ for the commission of an offence.              The\n     expression ‘penalty’ is a word of wide significance.\n     Sometimes, it means recovery of an amount as a penal\n     measure even in civil proceedings. An exaction which is not\n     compensatory in character is also termed as a ‘penalty’.\n     When penalty is imposed by an adjudicating officer, it is\n     done so in “adjudicatory proceedings” and not by way of fine\n     as a result of ‘prosecution’ of an ‘accused’ for commission of\n     an ‘offence’ in a criminal court. Therefore, merely because\n     ‘penalty’ clause exists in <a href=\"/doc/424628/\" id=\"a_574\">Section 23(1)(a)</a>, the nature of the\n     proceedings under that section is not changed from\n     ‘adjudicatory’ to ‘criminal’ prosecution. An order made by an\n     adjudicating authority under the Act is not that of conviction\n     but of determination of the breach of the civil obligation by\n     the offender”.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">136.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"98039898\" id=\"span_275\">In this regard, reference to a recent two-Judge Bench\n\ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/98039898/\" id=\"a_575\">Biswanath Bhattacharya v.

A contention was advanced by the appellant\n\ntherein that forfeiture is a penalty and, therefore, it could not be taken\n\nrecourse to without a conviction. The stand of the Union of India was\n\nthat the forfeiture contemplated under the said Act was not a penalty\n\nwithin the meaning of that expression occurring in <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_577\">Article 20</a>, but only\n\na deprivation of property to a legislatively identified class of persons –\n\nin the event of their inability to explain to the satisfaction of the State\n\nthat they had legitimate sources of funds for the acquisition of such\n\nproperty.   The two-Judge Bench, while explaining the stand of the\n\nUnion of India, took note of the fact that the Act is made applicable to\n\nfive classes of persons specified under <a href=\"/doc/564136/\" id=\"a_578\">Section 2</a> of the said Act. It\n\nalso observed that the conviction or the preventive detention\n\ncontemplated under the Act is not the basis or cause of confiscation,\n\nbut the factual basis for a rebuttable presumption to enable the State\n\nto initiate proceedings to examine whether the properties held by such\n\npersons are illegally acquired properties. In the ultimate eventuate,\n\nthe Court ruled that the forfeiture provided in the said enactment was\n\nnot violative of <a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_579\">Article 20</a> of the Constitution.     It also proceeded to\n\nstate:-</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">     “If a subject acquires property by means which are not\n     legally approved, the sovereign would be perfectly justified to\n     deprive such persons of the enjoyment of such ill-gotten\n     wealth.

In the case at hand, the entire proceeding is meant to arrive\n\nat the conclusion whether on the basis of the application preferred by\n\nthe Public Prosecutor and the material brought on record, the whole or\n\nany other money or some of the property in question have been\n\nacquired illegally and further any money or property or both have been\n\nacquired by the means of the offence.             After arriving at the said\n\nconclusion, the order of confiscation is passed.                The order of\n\nconfiscation is subject to appeal under Section 17 of the Orissa Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_164\">That apart, it is provided under <a href=\"/doc/1093594/\" id=\"a_582\">Section 19</a> where an order of\n\nconfiscation made under <a href=\"/doc/1405209/\" id=\"a_583\">Section 15</a> is modified or annulled by the\n\nHigh Court in appeal or the where the person affected is acquitted by\n\nthe special court, the money or property or both shall be returned to\n\nthe person affected. Thus, it is basically a confiscation which is\n\ninterim in nature. Therefore, it is not a punishment as envisaged in\n\nlaw and hence, it is difficult to accept the submission that it is a\n\npre-trial punishment and, accordingly, we repel the said submission.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_165\">138.       The   next   facet   of   the   said    submission    pertains   to\n\nretrospective applicability.

It is contended\n\nthat there was no interim confiscation under the 1988 Act but under\n\nthe Orissa Act they have to face confiscation. We have already opined\n\nthat confiscation is not a punishment and, therefore, <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_584\">Article 20(1)</a> is\n\nnot attracted. Thus, the real grievance pertains to going through the\n\nprocess of confiscation and suffering the same after the ultimate\n\nadjudication of the said proceeding which is subject to appeal. In this\n\ncontext we are required to see the earlier provision.

Learned counsel for the appellants would submit that under\n\nthe 1988 Act the accused were liable to face attachment during trial\n\nand forfeiture after conviction but by virtue of the Orissa Act they are\n\ncompelled to face confiscation as a consequence of which they are\n\ndeprived of the possession and the property goes to the State\n\nGovernment. Learned counsel for the State would submit that the\n\nforfeiture is provided after the conviction as the property has to be\n\nforfeited and embezzled amount requires to be realized but it does not\n\ndebar the legislature to provide confiscation of property as an interim\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_281\">                                    135</span>\n\fmeasure by providing an adequate adjudicatory process. It is also\n\nsubmitted that the offence under <a href=\"/doc/564550/\" id=\"a_599\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> has its gravity and,\n\ntherefore, the stringent interim measure is the requisite. Alternatively,\n\nit is argued that when forfeiture was prescribed, and attachment of\n\nproperty was provided as an interim measure, different arrangement,\n\nmay be a stringent one, can always be provided by the legislature.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_167\">140.          We have already held that confiscation is not a punishment\n\nand hence, <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_600\">Article 20(1)</a> is not violated. Learned counsel for the State\n\nwould lay stress on the decision in State of Andhra Pradesh and\n\nOthers v. CH. Gandhi67.         In that case, the issue that arose for\n\nconsideration when the disciplinary proceeding was initiated, one type\n\nof punishment was imposable and when the punishment was imposed\n\ndue to amendment of rule, a different punishment, which was a\n\ngreater one, was imposed.           The High Court opined that the\n\npunishment imposed under the amended rule amounted to imposition\n\nof two major penalties which was not there in the old rule. Dealing\n\nwith the issue the Court referred to the rule that dealt with major\n\npenalties and the rule making power.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"511990\" id=\"span_282\">Reference was made to the\n\ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/511990/\" id=\"a_601\">Pyare Lal Sharma v.

Under Section 420 of the Penal Code an\n        unlimited amount of fine could be imposed. <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_603\">Article 20(1)</a> of\n        the Constitution is in two parts.

The latter part of the article\n        prohibited the imposing of a penalty greater than that which\n        might have been inflicted under the law in force at the time\n        of the commission of the offence. The offence with which the\n        appellant had been charged was cheating punishable under\n        Section 420 of the Penal Code which was certainly a law in\n        force at the time of the commission of the offence. The\n        sentence of imprisonment which was imposed upon the\n        appellant was certainly not greater than that permitted by\n        Section 420. The sentence of fine also was not greater than\n        that which might have been inflicted under the law which\n        had been in force at the time of the commission of the\n        offence, as a fine unlimited in extent could be imposed\n        under the section.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_169\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"145075\" id=\"span_287\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1807066\" id=\"span_288\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1212211\" id=\"span_289\">141.

Rule 9(vii) was only\n        dealing with reduction or reversion but issuance of any\n        other direction was not a part of it. It has come by way of\n        amendment. The same being a lesser punishment than the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">69</span>\n     AIR 1960 SC 266\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_291\">70</span>\n     (1969) 1 SCC 445\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_292\">71</span>\n     (1975) 4 SCC 101\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_293\">                                    137</span>\n\f        maximum, in our considered opinion, is imposable and the\n        disciplinary authority has not committed any error by\n        imposing the said punishment, regard being had to the\n        nature of charges. It can be looked from another angle. The\n        rule-making authority has split Rule 9(vii) into two parts—\n        one is harsher than the other, but, both are less severe than\n        the other punishments, namely, compulsory retirement,\n        removal from service or dismissal. The reason behind it, as\n        we perceive, is not to let off one with simple reduction but to\n        give a direction about the condition of pay on restoration\n        and also not to impose a harsher punishment which may\n        not be proportionate. In our view, the same really does not\n        affect any vested or accrued right. It also does not violate\n        any constitutional protection.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_170\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"145075\" id=\"span_294\">142.          We are absolutely conscious that <a href=\"/doc/145075/\" id=\"a_607\">the said judgment</a> was\n\ndelivered in a different context. What is prohibited under <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_608\">Article 20(1)</a>\n\nis imposition of greater punishment that might have been imposed\n\nand prohibition of a conviction of any person for violation of law at the\n\ntime of commission of the act. We repeat at the cost of repetition that\n\nconfiscation being not a punishment does not come in either of the\n\ncategories. Thus viewed, the property of an accused facing trial under\n\nthe 1988 Act could be attached and there can be administration by\n\nthird party of the said property and eventual forfeiture after\n\nconviction.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"491046\" id=\"span_295\">The term “attachment” has been understood by this Court\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/491046/\" id=\"a_609\">Kerala State Financial Enterprises Ltd. v.

It is used for two purposes: (i) to compel the appearance\n       of a defendant; and (ii) to seize and hold his property for the\n       payment of the debt. It may also mean prohibition of\n       transfer, conversion, disposition or movement of property by\n       an order issued by the court.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\">143.        The legislature has thought it proper to change the nature\n\nand character of the interim measure.          The property obtained by\n\nill-gotten gains, if prima facie found to be such by the authorised\n\nofficer, is to be confiscated. An accused has no vested right as regards\n\nthe interim measure. He is not protected by any constitutional right to\n\nadvance the plea that he cannot be made liable to face confiscation\n\nproceedings of the property which has been accumulated by illegal\n\nmeans. That being the litmus test, the filament of reasoning has to\n\nrest in favour of confiscation and not against it. Therefore, we are of\n\nthe considered view that the          provision does not violate any\n\nconstitutional assurance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_172\">144.        The next aspect we shall address to whether the procedure\n\nfor confiscation as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/893415/\" id=\"a_610\">Section 13</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1405209/\" id=\"a_611\">Section 15</a> suffers\n\nfrom any lack of guidance. We have already opined that the State\n\nGovernment is only required to scrutinize the “offence” and authorises\n\nthe Public Prosecutor for the purpose of filing an application for\n\nconfiscation. The Public Prosecutor, as mandated under <a href=\"/doc/1686268/\" id=\"a_612\">Section 13(2)</a>\n\nis required to file an application indicating the reasons on the basis of\n\nwhich the State Government believes that the delinquent officer has\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_298\">                                    139</span>\n\fprocured the property by means of the offence. Thus, reasons have to\n\nbe stated in the application and it has to be clearly averred that the\n\nproperty has been acquired by means of the offence as defined under\n\nthe Orissa Act.        The authorised officer is a judicial officer and is\n\nrequired to afford reasonable opportunity of hearing to the accused or\n\nany other person operating the property on his behalf. Discretion is\n\nalso conferred on the authorised officer to record a finding whether all\n\nor any other money or property in question have been acquired\n\nillegally.   The said authority can drop the proceedings or direct\n\nconfiscation of all or some properties.         Affording of a reasonable\n\nopportunity of hearing is not confined only to file affidavits. We are\n\ninclined to think that when the delinquent is entitled to furnish an\n\nexplanation and also put forth his stand, he certainly can bring on\n\nrecord such material to sustain his explanation.             Confiscation\n\nproceeding as provided under sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/1405209/\" id=\"a_613\">Section 15</a> is subject\n\nto appeal. In view of the scheme of the Orissa Act, there can be no\n\nshadow of doubt that there is ample guidance in the procedure for\n\nconfiscation. It is not a proceeding where on the basis of launching of\n\nprosecution,     the    properties   are   confiscated.   Therefore,   the\n\nproceedings relating to confiscation cannot be regarded as violative of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_614\">article 14</a> because conferment of unchecked power or lack of guidance.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_173\">145.         Learned counsel for the appellants have laid emphasis on\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_299\">                                     140</span>\n\fthe phraseology used in Section 15(3) of the Orissa Act. The said\n\nprovision stipulates that where the authorised officer records a finding\n\nunder the Section that any money or property or both have been\n\nacquired, by means of the offence, he shall make a declaration subject\n\nto the provisions of the Act, then they stand confiscated to the State\n\nGovernment “free from all encumbrances”. It is submitted that once\n\nthe property stands confiscated to the State Government free from all\n\nencumbrances, the right, title and interest of the person concerned is\n\nextinguished. The said submission, in our consideration, is on a very\n\nbroad canvass. As the scheme of the Orissa Act would show, the\n\nconfiscation is interim in nature. It does not assume the character of\n\nfinality. Same is the position in Bihar Act. The accused is entitled to\n\nget return of the property or money in case he succeeds in appeal\n\nbefore the High Court against the order passed by the authorised\n\nofficer or in the ultimate eventuality when the order of acquittal is\n\nrecorded. The words “free from all encumbrances”, in the context, are\n\nto be given restricted meaning. It is to repel third party claims and\n\nnegate attempts to undo and invalidate the temporary or interim\n\nconfiscation till the final decision.   It cannot be equated with the\n\nprovisions in other statutes where by operation of law the property\n\nvests with the State Government free from all encumbrances where\n\nthe rights of the person concerned get obliterated.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_300\">                                  141</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1892742\" id=\"span_301\">146.

This submission\n\nis founded on the protection given under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_623\">Article 20(3)</a> of the\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_179\">151.       There can be no cavil over the proposition that an accused\n\nhas the right to maintain silence and not to disclose his defence before\n\ntrial. It is worth noting here that the Authorised Officer is a judicial\n\nofficer and he is required to deal with material for the limited purpose\n\nof confiscation. That apart, there is a statutory protection that the\n\nmaterial produced before the Authorised Officer shall not be used\n\nduring trial.   If we understand the said provision appositely, it is\n\ngraphically clear that the materials produced before the authorised\n\nofficer are not to be looked into during trial, and the trial is to proceed\n\nin accordance with the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_624\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> and subject to the\n\nprovisions of the 1988 act as long as there is no inconsistency. The\n\ntrial Judge is a senior judicial officer and has a trained judicial mind.\n\nIf something is not to be looked into, it shall by no means be looked\n\ninto.   The constitutional protection under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_625\">Article 20(3)</a> is in no way\n\naffected. That apart, <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_626\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution speaks about the\n\nguarantee against “testimonial compulsion”.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_317\">In   the   case   of   <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_627\">M.P.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_318\">                                   144</span>\n\fSharma v.

It is suggested that this is\n          confined to the oral evidence of a person standing his trial\n          for an offence when called to the witness-stand. We can\n          see no reason to confine the content of the constitutional\n          guarantee to this barely literal import. So to limit it would\n          be to rob the guarantee of its substantial purpose and to\n          miss the substance for the sound as stated in certain\n          American decisions. The phrase used in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_629\">Article 20(3)</a> is “to\n          be a witness”. A person can “be a witness” not merely by\n          giving oral evidence but also by producing documents or\n          making intelligible gestures as in the case of a dumb\n          witness (See <a href=\"/doc/211471/\" id=\"a_630\">Section 119</a> of the Evidence Act) or the like.\n          “To be a witness” is nothing more than “to furnish\n          evidence” and such evidence can be furnished through the\n          lips or by production of a thing or of a document or in\n          other modes.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">                                   ***\n             The phrase used in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_631\">Article 20(3)</a> is “to be a witness” and\n          not to “appear as a witness”. It follows that the protection\n          afforded to an accused in so far as it is related, to the\n          phrase “to be a witness” is not merely in respect of\n          testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well\n          extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from\n          him. It is available therefore to a person against whom a\n          formal accusation relating to the commission of an offence\n          has been levelled which in the normal course may result\n          in prosecution. Whether it is available to other persons in\n          other situations does not call for decision in this case”.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_180\">152.          Tested on the aforesaid enunciation of law, it can be stated\n\nwith certitude that the right conferred on an accused under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_632\">Article\n\n20(3)</a> is not violated. We reiterate that whatever is produced before the\n\nauthorised officer is not to be looked into by the trial court and neither\n\nthe prosecution nor the defence can refer to the same. That is the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_319\">80</span>\n     AIR 1954 SC 300\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_320\">                                     145</span>\n\fstatutory command.

The next aspect which needs to be addressed is the validity\n\nof Section 17 of the Orissa Act which deals with appeal.          The said\n\nprovision reads as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_167\">       “<a href=\"/doc/690830/\" id=\"a_633\">Section 17</a>. Appeal:- (1) Any person. aggrieved by any order\n       of the authorised officer under this Chapter may appeal to\n       the High Court within thirty days from the date on which the\n       order appealed against was passed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\">       (2) Upon any appeal preferred under this section the High\n       Court may, after giving such parties, as it thinks proper, an\n       opportunity of being heard, pass such order as it thinks fit.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_169\">       (3) An appeal preferred under sub-section (1) shall be\n       disposed of within a period of three months from the date it\n       is preferred, and stay order, if any, passed in an appeal shall\n       not remain in force beyond the prescribed period of disposal\n       of appeal.”\n                                                  [underlining is ours]\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_182\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"8212\" id=\"span_321\">154.        Learned counsel for the appellants have seriously criticised\n\n<a href=\"/doc/724908/\" id=\"a_634\">Section 17(3)</a> on the ground that the said provision interferes with the\n\njudicial proceeding by laying down that the said order shall not remain\n\nin force beyond the prescribed period of disposal of appeal. It appears\n\nthat such a contention was not raised before the High Court, for the\n\nHigh Court has not dealt with the same. However, Mr. S.K. Padhi,\n\nlearned senior counsel for the respondent-State, would submit that in\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/113789479/\" id=\"a_635\">Orissa Special Courts Act, 1990</a> (Orissa Act 22 of 1992) contained\n\na similar provision and the Division Bench in <a href=\"/doc/8212/\" id=\"a_636\">Kishore Chandra Patel</a>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_322\">                                     146</span>\n\f(supra) construed the said provision by opining that the provision in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/141483/\" id=\"a_637\">Section 18(3)</a> limiting the operation of stay order, if any, passed in\n\nappeal for a period of three months does not prohibit passing of a\n\nfresh stay order beyond that period, if a case for the same were to be\n\nmade out to the satisfaction of the Court. At this stage, we may note\n\nwith profit that the High Court of Patna has dealt with Section 17(3) of\n\nthe Bihar Act which provides that an appeal shall be disposed of\n\npreferably within a period of six months from the date it is preferred,\n\nand stay order, if any, passed in an appeal shall not remain in force\n\nbeyond the prescribed period of disposal of appeal. It has been held\n\ntherein that it would not be proper to construe that the prescribed\n\nperiod of disposal of appeal is only six months but it is only desirable\n\nthat the appeal should be disposed of within six months and the\n\nstipulation that the order of stay is not to remain in force beyond the\n\nperiod of disposal of appeal would not mean that the order of stay will\n\nlose its force during the pendency of the appeal. The High Court has\n\nlaid emphasis on the word “preferably” to interpret that the intention\n\nof the legislature is that the appeal should be disposed of within six\n\nmonths but it does not mean that the appeal has to be disposed of\n\nwithin six months. The High Court has further observed that it would\n\nnot be proper to construe that the prescribed period of disposal of\n\nappeal is only six months and, therefore, the stay order passed by the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_323\">                                  147</span>\n\fHigh Court will lose its force automatically on expiry of any particular\n\nperiod.     It   has   placed   the   said   interpretation   to   save   the\n\nconstitutionality of the provision. We have referred to the Bihar Act at\n\nthis juncture as the provisions are similar to the Orissa Act except the\n\nword “preferably” used in Section 17(3) of the Bihar Act. There can be\n\nno doubt that no statutory provision can postulate that an order of\n\nstay shall not remain in force beyond the period meant for disposal of\n\nthe appeal. The High Court of Patna has construed the provision by\n\nlaying down stress on the word “preferably”.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8212\" id=\"span_324\">We are disposed to think\n\nthat the interpretation placed on the similar provision of the Orissa\n\nAct in <a href=\"/doc/8212/\" id=\"a_638\">Kishore Chandra Patel</a> (supra) is correct and, therefore, we\n\nare disposed to hold that the order of stay if passed in an appeal\n\nwould not debar or prohibit the High Court to pass a fresh stay order\n\nbeyond that period, if a case is made out to the satisfaction of the\n\ncourt.    We would like to add that the legislative intent is that an\n\nappeal has to be tried absolutely expeditiously regard being had to the\n\nscheme of the Orissa Act as well as the Bihar Act and the person\n\ngrieved by the order passed by the authorities should not enjoy an\n\norder of stay beyond that period. Proper construction that has to be\n\nplaced would be that the High Court while exercising the power of\n\nappeal can extend the period of stay subject to its satisfaction unless\n\nthere is justifiable reason      for vacating the say. This provision,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_325\">                                      148</span>\n\fneedless to say, has to be read in this manner to save it from the vice\n\nof unconstitutionality. However, we may clearly state that the High\n\nCourt being a superior court having the power of judicial review shall\n\nsee to it that the real purpose of the legislation is not defeated. It will\n\nbe advisable and that the Chief Justice should demarcate a Bench for\n\none day to hear these appeals.         And accordingly, we so request.\n\nNeedless to say, the learned Judge will endeavour to dispose of the\n\nappeal within the time frame.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_183\">155.        Learned counsel for the appellants have seriously criticized\n\nthe proviso appended to Section 18(1) of the Orissa Act. To appreciate\n\nthe assail, <a href=\"/doc/926596/\" id=\"a_639\">Section 18(1)</a> is reproduced in entirety:-\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_170\">       “<a href=\"/doc/926596/\" id=\"a_640\">Section 18(1)</a>. Where any money or property or both have\n       been confiscated to the State Government under this Act,\n       the concerned authorised officer shall order the person\n       affected, as well as any other person, who may be in\n       possession of the money or property or both to surrender or\n       deliver possession thereof to the concerned authorised\n       officer or to any person duly authorised by him in this\n       behalf, within thirty days of the service of the order:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\">             Provided that the authorised officer, on an application\n       made in that behalf and being satisfied that the person\n       affected is residing in the property in question, may instead\n       of dispossessing him immediately from the same, permit\n       such person to occupy it for a limited period to be specified\n       on payment of market rent to the State Government and\n       thereafter, such person shall deliver the vacant possession\n       of the property.”\n\n       Criticizing the said provision, it is urged by them that by virtue of\n\nthe provision pertaining to confiscation the delinquent officer/accused\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_326\">                                     149</span>\n\fis compelled to face a situation where he will be disposed from his\n\ndwelling house, the so called protection given under the proviso is an\n\nillusory one. It is argued that when the money is confiscated, it is\n\nwell- nigh impossible on his part to deposit the market rent to occupy\n\neven for a limited period. The argument, if we permit ourselves to say\n\nso, suffers from a fundamental fallacy. Under the scheme of the Orissa\n\nAct, the confiscation does not take place immediately on lodging of an\n\nFIR.   A detailed procedure has been stipulated which is contain\n\nadequate safeguards and thereafter the order is given effect to. The\n\nproviso appended to Section 18(1) of the Orissa Act is an exception to\n\ngive protection to the concerned officer to remain in possession of the\n\nhouse where he resides for a certain period. The person concerned is\n\ngiven protection subject to certain terms. It is to be borne in mind\n\nthat the confiscation is associated with the property accumulated from\n\nthe ill-gotten gain. It is urged that though proviso gives protection, it\n\nactually mocks at <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_641\">Article 21</a> of the Constitutions. We do not think so.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_172\">The property is confiscated by way of an interim measure by taking\n\nrecourse to law which we have held to be constitutionally valid. The\n\nsubmission that the man will be in the streets is an argument in\n\nfrustration but not founded on reason. Be that as it may, when by\n\ndetermination of the authorised officer for the purpose of confiscation,\n\nthe plea that he will be ousted from the dwelling house which would\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_327\">                                  150</span>\n\fplay foul of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_642\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, really does not commend\n\nacceptance. A person cannot be allowed to indulge in corruption and\n\nconceive of protection to his dwelling house after a finding is recorded\n\nin the proceeding for confiscation that it is constructed or purchased\n\nby way of corrupt means. The person concerned can satisfy the\n\nauthorised officer or in appeal that the dwelling house where he is\n\nresiding is acquired from his known sources of income.       In such a\n\nsituation, we are afraid that we cannot accept the submission\n\nadvanced by the learned counsel for the appellants and, accordingly,\n\nthe same stands rejected.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_184\">156.       The next provision which is challenged is Section 19 of the\n\nOrissa Act that deals with refund of confiscated money or property in\n\nthe event of the order of confiscation being modified or annulled by the\n\nHigh Court in appeal.       The said provision is necessary to be\n\nreproduced:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_173\">       “19. Refund of confiscated money or property.- Where an\n       order of confiscation made under <a href=\"/doc/1405209/\" id=\"a_643\">section 15</a> is modified or\n       annulled by the High Court in appeal or where the person\n       affected is acquitted by the Special Court, the money or\n       property or both shall be returned to the person affected\n       and in case it is not possible for any reason to return the\n       property, such person shall be paid the price thereof\n       including the money so confiscated with the interest at the\n       rate of five per cent per annum thereon calculated from the\n       date of confiscation.”\n                                  (underlining is ours)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_185\">157.       The challenge of the appellants pertains to the part we have\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_328\">                                  151</span>\n\funderlined. It is submitted that the said provision is confiscatory in\n\nnature and is violative of <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_644\">Article 300A</a> of the Constitution. It is urged\n\nthat the said provision enables the State Government to appropriate\n\nthe property of a person who eventually succeeds in appeal or\n\nultimately is acquitted. Learned counsel for the State would submit\n\nthat when there is no possibility of being returned for a reason which\n\nis beyond the control of the State Government, then the said provision\n\nwill come into play. The High Court of Patna while dealing with the\n\nsimilar provision contained in Section 19 of the Bihar Act in order to\n\nsave its constitutionality has held that in case the confiscated property\n\nis not returned by showing good reasons that it is not possible to do\n\nso, the interest payable must be at the usual bank rate prevailing\n\nduring the relevant period for a loan to purchase or acquire similar\n\nproperty. It has further observed that said direction is necessary in\n\norder to save the vires of Section 19 of the Bihar Act and otherwise the\n\nrelevant provision would fall foul of provisions of the Constitution.\n\nThe view expressed by the High Court of Patna is not correct. The\n\nprovision has to be construed in a seemly manner. The language used\n\nis “in case it is not possible for any reason to return the property”. Mr.\n\nRanjit Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing for the State of Bihar\n\nwould submit that in case this Court read down the said provision,\n\nand, if it is not inclined to do so, it may apply doctrine of severability.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_329\">                                   152</span>\n\fMr. A. Saran, learned senior counsel for the appellants, per contra,\n\nwould contend that it is the obligation of the State Government to\n\nreturn the money as it is and there cannot be a stipulation to return\n\nthe value with five per cent interest, for it is absolutely obnoxious.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_186\">158.      The language employed in Section 19 of the Orissa Act has\n\nto be appreciated regard being had to the scheme of the said Act. The\n\nlegislative intent is to curb corruption at high places and requires the\n\naccused persons to face trial in the Special Court constituted under\n\nthe Orissa Act in a speedier manner and also to see that the\n\nbeneficiaries of ill-gotten property or money do not enjoy the property\n\nor money during trial. That apart, the intention is also clear that the\n\nGovernment should not appropriate the money or the property to itself\n\nin any manner. Confiscation, we have already opined, is done as an\n\ninterim measure. The words “free from all encumbrances” have been\n\ngiven a restricted meaning by us as it follows from the language used\n\nin the Orissa Act. <a href=\"/doc/1093594/\" id=\"a_645\">Section 19</a> clearly lays down return of the\n\nconfiscated money or property or both.            It conceives of three\n\nsituations, namely, modification of the order of confiscation, or\n\nannulment of confiscation, or the eventual acquittal. In these\n\nconditions, the money or property or both are required to be returned.\n\nThe words, which we have underlined in <a href=\"/doc/1093594/\" id=\"a_646\">Section 19</a>, seem to us,\n\ncannot be conferred a wide meaning.          They cannot be allowed to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_330\">                                   153</span>\n\fconvey that the State will not return the property. The key words are\n\n“in case it is not possible” and “for any reason”.       It will be an\n\nassumption to think that “for any reason” would mean any kind of\n\nsubjective reason. In certain statutes or enactments the words “for any\n\nreason” can be attributed a wide meaning to subserve the legislative\n\npurpose. The term “possible”, in our considered opinion, may not be\n\ngiven the stature or status of “impossible”, which is absolute in its\n\nconnotation, but the word “possible”, as we perceive, in itself contains\n\ncertain concept of reason. The reason ascribed by the State has to\n\nwithstand scrutiny in the strict sense. As indicated before, it may not\n\nbe conceived in absolute terms like the word “impossible”, for law does\n\nnot countenance an impossible thing to be done.          Therefore, the\n\nconstruction that is required to be placed on this provision is that the\n\nState must clearly demonstrate that it has a real and acceptable\n\nreason and hence, it is not possible not to return the money or\n\nproperty or both. Such an interpretation shall save the provision from\n\nthe vice of unconstitutionality. We think so as there may be situations\n\nwhere it may not be possible on the part of the State to return the\n\nproperty. No illustration need be given because it would depend upon\n\nfacts of each case.   The argument by the appellants is that in such a\n\nsituation the payment of value determined and the rate of interest\n\nprovided in the provision is absolutely irrational and the State can\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_331\">                                  154</span>\n\fappropriate the property. The aforesaid submission, though on a first\n\nblush, may look quite attractive, but on a deeper scrutiny, is bound to\n\nmelt into insignificance. It is to be remembered that the proceeding is\n\ninitiated for confiscation in respect of the property acquired by the\n\noffence as described under the Act. It is done on the basis of certain\n\nmaterial brought on record. Ultimately the proceedings may not be\n\nsuccessful but if it is not possible to return the property the State\n\ncannot be asked to compensate more than what the legislature has\n\nthought to be appropriate. It cannot be equated with acquisition. The\n\nentire proceeding is initiated regard being had to the rampant\n\ncorruption at high places in the present day society.    Therefore, to\n\nthink that submission that there has to be adequate compensation\n\nwould be against the larger public interest.    Thus understood, the\n\nchallenge to the provision on the backdrop of <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_647\">Article 300A</a> has to be\n\ntreated as unacceptable and we do so. We may hasten to add that any\n\norder passed under this provision is always subject to judicial review\n\nby the superior courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_187\">159.      We have at the beginning had mentioned that both the\n\nOrissa Act and the Bihar Act are almost similar and, wherever\n\nrequired we have adverted to the same while dealing with the Orissa\n\nAct. Barring the same, we do not find there is any distinction between\n\nthe two enactments and, therefore, analysis made by us as regards the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_332\">                                 155</span>\n\fOrissa Act will apply to the Bihar Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_188\">160.        It is significant to note here that before the High Court of\n\nPatna the validity of a Rule was assailed but the application was not\n\npressed and the High Court has made certain observations. We intend\n\nto put the controversy to rest.    Rule 12 of the 2010 Rules provides for\n\nSpecial Courts to follow summary procedure.

The facts, in a nutshell, are that the appellant was a Manager of\n\nthe Primary Agriculture Credit Co-operative Society, Village Pipraua,\n\nDistrict Gwalior. On the basis of allegations made, a case under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_664\">Section 13(1)(e)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (for short,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_338\">                                  161</span>\n\f‘the 1988 Act’) was registered against him. After investigation it was\n\nfound that he had secured assets and property of Rs. 1,05,44,604/-\n\nand, accordingly, sanction was sought to launch prosecution against\n\nhim, and it was granted. As the factual matrix would reveal, the trial\n\ncourt proceeded and charges were framed against him. The order of\n\nframing the charge was assailed in a Writ Petition which stood\n\ndismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_203\">3.   In the petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_665\">Section 482</a> CrPC it was contended before\n\nthe High Court that the sanction to prosecute the accused had not\n\nbeen granted in accordance with law as there had been no application\n\nof mind. The High Court, after hearing the learned counsel for the\n\nparties, has held as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_185\">     “We have perused the judgments of the Hon’ble Supreme\n     Court and facts and evidence on record of the case. In our\n     opinion, the sanctioning authority has considered all the\n     facts of the case. There is prima facie evidence against the\n     petitioner in regard to acquiring property and assets in\n     excess to his known source of income. In granting sanction\n     to prosecute under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_666\">Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988</a> it\n     is not necessary for the authority to pass a detailed reasoned\n     judgment and order. The authority has to apply its mind.\n     Even otherwise, there is sufficient evidence prime facie to\n     prosecute the petitioner.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_204\">4.   In this appeal on a perusal of the grounds, we find that there are\n\nnumerous reference to M.P. Vishesh Nyayalaya Adiniya, 2011. The\n\nconstitutionality of the said Act was not questioned before the High\n\nCourt as it could not have been questioned under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_667\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_339\">                                  162</span>\n\fHowever, we may note that almost similar Acts, namely, the <a href=\"/doc/113789479/\" id=\"a_668\">Orissa\n\nSpecial Courts Act, 2006</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/14059367/\" id=\"a_669\">Bihar Special Courts Act, 2009</a>, have\n\nbeen treated to be valid by this Court in Civil Appeal Nos. 6448-6452\n\nof 2011 titled Yogendra Kumar Jaiswal Etc. v.

It is contended that the grant of sanction is not an empty\n\nformality and there has to be application of mind in support of the\n\nsaid sanction. We have been commended to <a href=\"/doc/1992131/\" id=\"a_670\">Mansukhlal Vithaldas\n\nChauhan v. State of Gujarat81</a> wherein a two-Judge Bench while\n\ndealing with grant of sanction has observed:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_186\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"86350\" id=\"span_341\">“18. The validity of the sanction would, therefore, depend\n       upon the material placed before the sanctioning authority\n       and the fact that all the relevant facts, material and evidence\n       have been considered by the sanctioning authority.\n       Consideration implies application of mind. The order of\n       sanction must ex facie disclose that the sanctioning\n       authority had considered the evidence and other material\n       placed before it. This fact can also be established by extrinsic\n       evidence by placing the relevant files before the Court to\n       show that all relevant facts were considered by the\n       sanctioning authority. (See also <a href=\"/doc/86350/\" id=\"a_671\">Jaswant Singh v. State of\n       Punjab</a>, AIR 1958 SC 124, and State of Bihar v. P.P. Sharma,\n       1992 Supp. (1) SCC 222.)</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_187\">       19. Since the validity of “sanction” depends on the\n       applicability of mind by the sanctioning authority to the facts\n       of the case as also the material and evidence collected during\n       investigation, it necessarily follows that the sanctioning\n       authority has to apply its own independent mind for the\n       generation of genuine satisfaction whether prosecution has\n       to be sanctioned or not. The mind of the sanctioning\n       authority should not be under pressure from any quarter nor\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_342\">81</span>\n     (1997) 7 SCC 622\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_343\">                                     163</span>\n\f       should any external force be acting upon it to take a decision\n       one way or the other. Since the discretion to grant or not to\n       grant sanction vests absolutely in the sanctioning authority,\n       its discretion should be shown to have not been affected by\n       any extraneous consideration. If it is shown that the\n       sanctioning authority was unable to apply its independent\n       mind for any reason whatsoever or was under an obligation\n       or compulsion or constraint to grant the sanction, the order\n       will be bad for the reason that the discretion of the authority\n       “not to sanction” was taken away and it was compelled to act\n       mechanically to sanction the prosecution.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_206\">6.     In State of Karnataka v. Ameerjan82, while dealing with the\n\ngrant of sanction, it has been held thus:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_188\">       “9. We agree that an order of sanction should not be\n       construed in a pedantic manner. But, it is also well settled\n       that the purpose for which an order of sanction is required to\n       be passed should always be borne in mind. Ordinarily, the\n       sanctioning authority is the best person to judge as to\n       whether the public servant concerned should receive the\n       protection under the Act by refusing to accord sanction for\n       his prosecution or not.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_189\">       10. For the aforementioned purpose, indisputably,\n       application of mind on the part of the sanctioning authority\n       is imperative. The order granting sanction must be\n       demonstrative of the fact that there had been proper\n       application of mind on the part of the sanctioning authority.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_207\">       We have noticed hereinbefore that the sanctioning authority\n       had purported to pass the order of sanction solely on the\n       basis of the report made by the Inspector General of Police,\n       Karnataka Lokayukta. Even the said report has not been\n       brought on record. Thus, whether in the said report, either in\n       the body thereof or by annexing therewith the relevant\n       documents, IG Police, Karnataka Lokayukta had placed on\n       record the materials collected on investigation of the matter\n       which would prima facie establish existence of evidence in\n       regard to the commission of the offence by the public servant\n       concerned is not evident. Ordinarily, before passing an order\n       of sanction, the entire records containing the materials\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_344\">82</span>\n     (2007) 11 SCC 273\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_345\">                                    164</span>\n\f       collected against the accused should be placed before the\n       sanctioning authority. In the event, the order of sanction\n       does not indicate application of mind as (sic to) the materials\n       placed before the said authority before the order of sanction\n       was passed, the same may be produced before the court to\n       show that such materials had in fact been produced.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_208\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1634320\" id=\"span_346\">7.     Be it noted that in the said case, the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1634320/\" id=\"a_672\">Prakash Singh\n\nBadal v.
