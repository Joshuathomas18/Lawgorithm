It is seen that two common orders are passed by the\n\nlearned Judge of the Special Court.

Both the orders are\n\nchallenged before this Court by the Union of India represented by the National\n\nInvestigation Agency, Kochi (&quot;NIA&quot;, in short). 7 Th accused, whose bail plea was\n\nrejected, has preferred a separate appeal challenging the order dated\n\n15.10.2020.

Accused\n\npersons were arrested by NIA on different dates and they have been confined\n\nto custody for a considerable time. Allegations raised by the investigating\n\nagency in brief is that on 05.07.2020, the officers of the Customs Department\n\nseized 30kgs of 24 carat gold, from International Airport, Thiruvananthapuram,\n\nsecreted in a consignment camouflaged as a diplomatic baggage sent from\n\nUnited Arab Emirates (UAE). It is alleged that the gold was smuggled through\n\nthe diplomatic channel pursuant to a conspiracy hatched by the accused 1 to\n\n4 and other accused persons. It is also alleged that they made use of the\n\ncontacts maintained by the accused 1 and 2 with the Consulate of UAE at\n\nThiruvananthapuram. The initial enquiry revealed, according to NIA, that the\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> connected cases                       17</span>\n\n\n\nproceeds of the smuggled gold could have been used for financing terrorist\n\nactivities in India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">       4.     Prosecution would allege that 7th accused is one of the main\n\norganizers of the smuggling activity along with accused 5, 6, 8, 9 and 10. It is\n\nthe definite prosecution case that they had smuggled gold about 21 times\n\nthrough diplomatic baggages sent to UAE Consulate from November 2019\n\nwith the intention of destabilizing economic security of India. 7 th accused had\n\ndirect contact with accused 1, 2 and 4 in addition to accused 17 to 19 and 25.\n\nAllegation is that 7th accused and persons having connection with him had\n\nfunded for smuggling gold weighing 47.5kgs. 8 th accused had funded for\n\nsmuggling 15kgs of gold through diplomatic baggages since November 2019\n\nby conspiring with 5th accused. 9th accused is a hawala operator and he\n\nfinanced the gold smuggling activity through diplomatic baggage since\n\nNovember 2019. Accused 11 and 12, in association with accused 6 and 10,\n\nhad smuggled gold and they are suspected to have used the proceeds for\n\nfinancing terrorism. 12th accused herein is one of the accused in the infamous\n\nhandchopping case having a linkage to terrorism in which some of the\n\naccused were convicted. However, he had been acquitted in that case.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">       5.     Allegation against accused 13 and 14 is that they had associated\n\nwith accused 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 to smuggle gold 21 times in various forms and\n\nafter November 2019, they assisted other accused persons for exchanging\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> connected cases                     18</span>\n\n\n\nthe smuggled gold at various places. 16th accused had conspired with 8th\n\naccused and arranged funds for smuggling gold multiple times in June 2020\n\nthrough the diplomatic channel. 19th accused had funded `65lakhs for\n\nsmuggling gold since June 2020 and obtained 1.5kgs of smuggled gold at\n\nThiruvananthapuram on multiple occasions.      He did so by conspiring with\n\naccused 5, 6, 7 and 16. It is further alleged that 21 st accused had conspired\n\nwith accused 8, 16 and 23 and handed over `70lakhs during June 2020 for\n\npurchasing smuggled gold. He had also travelled to Thiruvananthapuram\n\nalong with accused 16 and 23 to receive the smuggled gold from accused 4\n\nand 5 in the month of June 2020. Accusation against 22 nd accused is that he\n\nhad funded `1.25crore each on three occasions for obtaining smuggled gold\n\nthrough the above said channel. It is further alleged that he had associated\n\nwith accused 7, 17 and 22. 23rd accused also conspired with accused 8, 16\n\nand 21 since June 2020 and handed over `1.8crore for purchasing gold. He\n\nhad also travelled to Thiruvananthapuram along with accused 16 and 21 for\n\nreceiving the smuggled gold. According to the prosecution, 24 th accused had\n\nalso conspired with accused 7, 8, 17 and 22 during June 2020 and had\n\ninvested `1.25crore each on three occasions for purchasing smuggled gold.\n\nProsecution would contend that each of the accused had contacted many\n\nother accused persons as is evident from the Call Data Records (CDR) in\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> connected cases                       19</span>\n\n\n\nrespect of each of them. NIA had filed a diagram before the learned trial\n\nJudge showing the details of contacts between the accused persons. A\n\nrevised diagram has been filed by NIA before this Court describing how the\n\naccused persons contacted each other in the course of the criminal\n\ntransaction.

To cut NIA&#x27;s long story short, the\n\naforementioned accused persons are alleged to have funded for smuggling\n\ngold through diplomatic channel or conspired together for arranging the same.\n\nBesides, they contacted each other either directly or through intermediaries.\n\nAccused 1 to 5 and 7 had played a prominent role in committing the offences.\n\nDistribution of the gold, alleged to have been obtained through the diplomatic\n\nbaggages on various occasions, among the accused is explained by NIA with\n\nthe help of a diagram.

Common grounds taken in the appeals filed by NIA are that the\n\ncourt below ought to have seen that the facts in the case, viewed in the\n\nbackground of <a href=\"/doc/503626/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/96524627/\" id=\"a_5\">43D</a> of the UA(P) Act, did not justify grant of\n\nbail in favour of the accused, that the court below failed to consider the over\n\nall effect of the materials gathered by the prosecution and made available\n\nbefore the court indicating a prima facie case against the accused and that the\n\ncourt below should have considered the peculiar nature of the offence,\n\nwherein numerous persons are involved, requiring a time consuming\n\ninvestigation deep into the matter to bring out true facts. Further, the court\n\nbelow ought to have seen that out of 99 devices taken into custody, the\n\nevidence from 22 devices only could be decoded and examined which itself\n\nproduced voluminous and substantial evidence in respect of the roles played\n\nby the accused persons. Having found that there are legal reasons for\n\ngranting an extension of time to 180 days to complete the investigation, the\n\ncourt below should not have granted bail to some of the accused persons.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">      7.     Per contra, learned counsel appearing for the accused contended\n\nthat despite consuming much time, the investigating agency could not find out\n\nany reason justifying further detention of the accused persons. It is also\n\ncontended that <a href=\"/doc/503626/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 15</a> of the UA(P) Act is totally inapplicable to the facts\n\nof this case. In the appeal filed by 7th accused, he questioned the legal and\n\nfactual reasons stated by the trial court for denying bail.\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> connected cases                       24</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">      8.     Learned ASG contended that the court below viewed the matter\n\nas a simple case of smuggling. According to him, the inconsistent views taken\n\nby the learned Judge can be seen on a conjoint reading of paragraphs 2 to 6,\n\nwherein the facts have been mentioned, and in paragraph 19, it is indicated\n\nthat the case on hand is a mere act of smuggling gold without attracting the\n\noffence of &quot;terrorist act&quot; as defined under <a href=\"/doc/503626/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 15</a> of the UA(P) Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">      9.     At the outset, the learned counsel appearing for the accused\n\npersons canvassed a proposition that the appeals filed by NIA are\n\nincompetent as they were not properly instituted before this Court. It is seen\n\nfrom the cause title to the appeal memoranda that the appeals are filed by\n\nUnion of India, represented by the Superintendent of Police, NIA, Ernakulam.\n\nMemoranda of appeals have been signed by the Superintendent of Police,\n\nNIA, Kochi. Shri Arjun Ambalappatta, learned prosecutor for NIA submitted\n\nthat he presented the appeal memoranda on which the learned Assistant\n\nSolicitor General of India, High Court of Kerala, Kochi had also signed. We\n\nnotice that there is no dispute raised by the other side about this assertion by\n\nthe learned prosecutor. According to the learned counsel for the accused\n\npersons, the provisions in <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 24</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\n\n(&quot;<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_9\">Cr.P.C</a>.&quot;, in short) was not followed while instituting these appeals.

Relying on <a href=\"/doc/1271595/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 24</a> of Cr.P.C. learned counsel for the accused\n\ncontended that the Superintendent of Police, NIA, Kochi has no authority to\n\nfile the appeals and they should have been filed through the public prosecutor.\n\nTo advance this argument, reliance is placed on two decisions rendered by\n\nDivision Benches of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1088007/\" id=\"a_12\">State of Kerala v. Krishnan</a> (<a href=\"/doc/136373838/\" id=\"a_13\">1981 KLT 839)\n\nand Benny P. Jacob and another v.

Therefore, the question was whether the State\n\nGovernment could have directed the Advocate General or Additional Advocate\n\nGeneral to present an appeal under <a href=\"/doc/487026/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 378(1)</a> of Cr.P.C. without\n\nappointing them as public prosecutors under <a href=\"/doc/726894/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 24(1)</a> of Cr.P.C. in view\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1673997/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 165</a> of the Constitution of India and the Rules framed by the\n\nGovernment under Clauses 2 and 3 of <a href=\"/doc/1673997/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 165.</a> The Bench, after an\n\nelaborate consideration, refused leave to appeal sought for by the State\n\nfinding that the appeals were not filed by the public prosecutor as required\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/487026/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 378(1)</a> of Cr.P.C. Following this decision, another Bench in\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> connected cases                       27</span>\n\n\n\nBenny P. Jacob held that the appeal preferred by the State could be treated\n\nas defective as it was not preferred by the State public prosecutor. It is\n\ntherefore forcefully argued that the appeals filed by NIA should be dismissed\n\nin limine finding that they are incompetent.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"84701173\" id=\"span_16\">11.    Refuting these contentions, learned ASG and public prosecutor\n\nfor NIA argued that there is no defect in the institution of appeals and they are\n\nlaid properly in accordance with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_20\">National Investigation\n\nAgency Act, 2008</a> (&quot;<a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_21\">NIA Act</a>&quot; in short) and the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_22\">Cr.P.C</a>.

If we look into Sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/17471813/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 15</a>\n\nof NIA Act, it can be seen that every person appointed as a public prosecutor\n\nor an additional public prosecutor or a special public prosecutor under the\n\nSection shall be deemed to be a public prosecutor within the meaning of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1492800/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 2(u)</a> of Cr.P.C.

As pointed out earlier, <a href=\"/doc/709330/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 24(8)</a> of Cr.P.C. permits the Central\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\"> connected cases                      31</span>\n\n\n\nGovernment or the State Government to appoint for the purposes of any case\n\nor class of cases a person who has been in practice as an advocate for not\n\nless than ten years as a special public prosecutor. In the matter of\n\nappointment of a special public prosecutor under <a href=\"/doc/709330/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 24(8)</a> of Cr.P.C., we\n\nfind no reason to insist that it should be done in consultation with the High\n\nCourt as provided under <a href=\"/doc/726894/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 24(1)</a> of Cr.P.C. In other words, the power\n\nconferred on the authorities to appoint a special public prosecutor, specified\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/709330/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 24(8)</a> of Cr.P.C., could be regarded as a deviation from the\n\nprocedure prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/125261089/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 24(1)</a>. Our reasoning is strengthened by\n\na pronouncement made by the apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1468704/\" id=\"a_52\">Assistant Commissioner of\n\nCentral Excise, Hyderabad v. Sabnife Power Systems Ltd. and others</a>\n\n((2002) 9 SCC 389). In that case the State approached the High Court for\n\nenhancement of sentence imposed against the accused by the Special Judge\n\nfor economic offences, Hyderabad. The appeal was dismissed by the High\n\nCourt for two reasons. First, the appeal for enhancement of sentence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1708400/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 377(2)</a> of Cr.P.C. could be filed by the public prosecutor duly\n\nauthorized by the Central Government and        the special public prosecutor\n\nappearing on behalf of the appellant fairly admitted that the complainant was\n\nnot empowered by the Central Government to file the appeal. Second, the\n\nappeal was not filed by the public prosecutor as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1708400/\" id=\"a_54\">Section\n\n377(2)</a> of Cr.P.C., but it was filed by the special public prosecutor. The first\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\"> connected cases                       32</span>\n\n\n\nground on which the appeal was dismissed is affirmed by the Supreme Court.\n\nHowever, in respect of the second ground the following observations are\n\nmade:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                &quot;6.    This submission of the learned Additional\n\n         Solicitor-General requires to be accepted. <a href=\"/doc/709330/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 24(8)</a>\n\n         CrPC specifically empowers the Central Government or the\n\n         State Government to appoint a Special Public Prosecutor\n\n         for conducting any case or class of cases. Such Special\n\n         Public Prosecutor would be Public Prosecutor for all the\n\n         purposes under the Act. It cannot be said that the Special\n\n         Public Prosecutor is not a Public Prosecutor. Hence, the\n\n         second reason recorded by the High Court cannot be\n\n         justified.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">      14.    <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_56\">Admittedly NIA Act</a> is a special law to which <a href=\"/doc/708036/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 4(2)</a> of\n\nCr.P.C. may apply in respect of investigation, inquiry, trial, etc. Viewing the\n\nrival contentions in this background, we find that the challenges raised against\n\nmaintainability of the appeals are not sustainable, especially when we\n\nconsider the fact that the appeals were presented by the public prosecutor\n\nappointed by NIA under <a href=\"/doc/17471813/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 15</a> of NIA Act. We, therefore, find that the\n\nappeals filed by NIA are competent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">      15.

In the backdrop of the rival contentions, we are obliged to\n\ninterpret the scope of <a href=\"/doc/17471813/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 15</a> of UA(P) Act. <a href=\"/doc/126170422/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 15(1)</a> is the\n\nsubstantive part of the Section, wherein it is mentioned that whoever does any\n\nact with intent to threaten or likely to threaten the unity, integrity, security,\n\neconomic security or sovereignty of India through any of the modes specified\n\nin Clauses (a), (b) or (c) commits a terrorist act.

Main thrust of arguments raised by learned ASG is based on\n\n<a href=\"/doc/126170422/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 15(1)(a)(iiia)</a> of UA(P) Act to establish that the impugned order is\n\nlegally unsustainable. If we understand <a href=\"/doc/126170422/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 15(1)</a> as above, it is easy to\n\nunderstand Clause (a) thereto. Clause (a) to <a href=\"/doc/126170422/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 15(1)</a> illustrates some of\n\nthe means by which the unity, integrity, security, economic security or\n\nsovereignty of India could be threatened or terror could be struck in people or\n\nany section of the people in India or in any foreign country. It can be seen\n\nfrom <a href=\"/doc/126170422/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 15(1)(a)</a> that using bombs, dynamite or any explosive\n\nsubstances or inflammable substances or firearms or other lethal weapons or\n\npoisonous or noxious gases or other chemicals or by any other substances\n\n(whether biological radioactive, nuclear or otherwise) of a hazardous nature,\n\nthe unity, integrity, etc. of the nation could be threatened or terror could be\n\nstruck in people or any section of the people in India or in any foreign country.\n\nClause (a) makes it abundantly clear that the illustrations of criminal acts\n\ntherein are not exhaustive. The effects produced by such acts are dealt with in\n\nSub-clauses (i) to (iv) thereunder. If by using bombs, dynamites, etc, death or\n\ninjuries to any person or persons occur, it will be a terrorist act under Sub-\n\nclause (i). Likewise, under Sub-clause (ii), by using bombs, dynamites, etc. if\n\nloss or damage or destruction of property has happened, then also it will fall\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\"> connected cases                          38</span>\n\n\n\nwithin the definition of terrorist act.

In the FATF report, the\n\nsignificance of gold as a vehicle for money laundering was considered at page\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">6. According to the report, gold is used for money laundering for the following\n\ntwo reasons:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">                 &quot;There are two broad characteristics of gold and the\n\n          gold market which make it enticing to criminal groups.\n\n          The first is the nature and size of the market itself which\n\n          is highly reliant on cash as the method of exchange. The\n\n          second is the anonymity generated from the properties of\n\n          gold which make tracking its origins very difficult to do.\n\n          These factors make gold highly attractive to criminal\n\n          syndicates wishing to hide, move or invest their illicit\n\n          proceeds. &quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">The report takes note of the fact that gold can be traded anonymously and\n\ntransactions are difficult to be traced and verified. It also notices the fact that\n\ngold is a form of global currency and acts as a medium for exchange in\n\ncriminal transactions. Further, investment in gold provides reliable returns. It is\n\nalso observed in the report that gold is easily smuggled and traded - both\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\"> connected cases                        46</span>\n\n\n\nphysically and virtually. FATF report further takes note of the opportunities for\n\ngenerating illicit profit in the gold industry. After discussing all these matters,\n\nthe &quot;red flags&quot; identified by the organization are mentioned at page 20. It is\n\nargued by the learned ASG that bullion transferred among associates using\n\nbullion accounts (including family members) for no apparent commercial\n\npurpose and customer buying gold bullion and using a general post office or\n\nprivate service provider, mail box as their address, without listing a\n\ncorresponding box number are some of the instances of customer behaviour.\n\nInsofar as the trade based behaviour (also related to trade based money\n\nlaundering) is concerned, cash payments for high value orders are indications\n\nof trade based money laundering activity. It is therefore argued on behalf of\n\nNIA that these aspects could be unearthed only on a wide spread probe\n\ninvolving scrutiny of voluminous evidence recovered in the paper form and\n\nalso decoded from the electronic gadgets. It is true that the case involves a lot\n\nof transactions connecting various accused persons and accomplices. We are\n\nof the view that the investigating agency is justified in taking time for\n\ncompleting a threadbare investigation into all the aspects.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">      24.    At the same time, the contention of the accused persons that the\n\nmaterials placed before the court at the time of considering their bail\n\napplications did not reveal any of the offences charged against them has also\n\nto be considered to assess the legality of the impugned order.\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\"> connected cases                        47</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">      25.    Learned senior counsel appearing for 22 nd accused contended\n\nthat no contention regarding a direct communication of this accused with the\n\nkingpins has been raised in the remand application filed by NIA. According to\n\nhim, if <a href=\"/doc/17471813/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 15</a> of UA(P) Act is not applicable, then <a href=\"/doc/102631007/\" id=\"a_91\">Sections, 16</a>, <a href=\"/doc/94231430/\" id=\"a_92\">17</a> and <a href=\"/doc/190559726/\" id=\"a_93\">18</a>\n\nof the said Act will have no application. This argument is opposed by the\n\nlearned counsel on behalf of NIA contending that there are enough materials\n\nto rope the accused persons in the alleged offences. Further, <a href=\"/doc/94231430/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 17</a>\n\ndeals with punishment for raising funds for terrorist act. <a href=\"/doc/190559726/\" id=\"a_95\">Section 18</a> deals with\n\npunishment for conspiracy for not only a terrorist act, but for any act\n\npreparatory to commission of a terrorist act. We are of the opinion that the\n\noffences described under <a href=\"/doc/94231430/\" id=\"a_96\">Sections 17</a> and <a href=\"/doc/190559726/\" id=\"a_97\">18</a> of UA(P) Act are not fully\n\ndependant on the definition of terrorist act in <a href=\"/doc/17471813/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 15</a>. Proof of other\n\naspects also could attract those offences. It may be too early for us to express\n\nany opinion either way relating to the offences attracted in the case at this\n\nstage. Therefore, we do not express any opinion regarding the offences that\n\ncould be made out against the accused persons after the investigation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">      26.    Learned senior counsel and other counsel appearing for the\n\naccused persons strongly contended that on a plain reading of <a href=\"/doc/126170422/\" id=\"a_99\">Section 15(1)</a>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">(a)(iiia) of UA(P) Act, it can be seen that the definition of terrorist act falling\n\nwithin this part of the Section does not deal with smuggling of gold.\n\nIndisputably, smuggling as defined under <a href=\"/doc/64279/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 2(39)</a> of the Customs Act is\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\"> connected cases                       48</span>\n\n\n\npunishable under Section 135 of the said Act. As mentioned earlier, the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_101\">Customs Act</a> is not included in the <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_102\">Schedule to the NIA Act</a> and therefore NIA\n\ncannot have a jurisdiction to investigate into any offence exclusively falling\n\nwithin the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_103\">Customs Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">      27.    It is discernible from <a href=\"/doc/126170422/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 15(1)(a)(iiia)</a> that what becomes a\n\nterrorist act thereunder is causing damage to the monetary stability of India by\n\nproducing high quality counterfeit Indian paper currency, coin or any other\n\nmaterial or smuggling of high quality counterfeit Indian paper currency, coin or\n\nany other material or circulating high quality counterfeit Indian paper currency,\n\ncoin or any other material. It is important to note that the qualifying words\n\n&quot;high quality counterfeit&quot; are applicable to Indian paper currency and coin.\n\nThis is evident from the statement of objects and reasons to the Bill\n\nintroduced for amending the statute as shown above. This is the split up of the\n\nabove Sub-clause to <a href=\"/doc/126170422/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 15(1)</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_58\">      28.    It is therefore strongly argued that what is sought to be declared\n\nas a terrorist act in this Sub-clause is the production, smuggling or circulation\n\nof high quality counterfeit Indian paper currency, coin or any other material so\n\nas to cause damage to the monetary stability of India. Learned counsel for the\n\naccused persons emphasized that the words &quot;high quality counterfeit Indian\n\npaper currency, coin or any other material&quot; will have to be understood as one\n\nclass of items intended to be produced or smuggled or circulated in order to\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\"> connected cases                       49</span>\n\n\n\ndamage the monetary stability of India. In other words, it is contended that\n\nhigh quality counterfeit Indian paper currency or coin cannot be disassociated\n\nor separated from the words &quot;any other material&quot;. According to them, the\n\nprinciple of ejusdem generis should be applied to interpret this provision.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">      29.     In this context, it will be apposite to consider the wafer-thin\n\ndistinction between &quot;noscitur a sociis&quot; and &quot;ejusdem generis&quot;. According to\n\nBlack&#x27;s Law Dictionary the expression &quot;noscitur a sociis&quot; means thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">               &quot;A canon of construction holding that the meaning of\n\n        an unclear word or phrase should be determined by the\n\n        words immediately surrounding it.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">The expression &quot;ejusdem generis&quot;, according to Black&#x27;s Law Dictionary,\n\nmeans thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">                &quot;A canon of construction that when a general word\n\n         or phrase follows a list of specific persons or things, the\n\n         general word or phrase will be interpreted to include only\n\n         persons or things of the same type as those listed. For\n\n         example, in the phrase horses, cattle, sheep, pigs, goats,\n\n         or any other barnyard animal, the general language or\n\n         any other barnyard animal - despite its seeming breadth\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">         - would probably be held to include only four-legged,\n\n         hoofed mammals (and thus would exclude chickens).&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\"> Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\"> connected cases                          50</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">      30.

A reading of Section 129-A and <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_109\">Section\n\n         133-A</a> of the Act together shows that the &quot;other person&quot;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">         referred to in <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 129-A</a> of the Act, who may be\n\n         empowered to discharge the powers under that section can\n\n         only mean an officer of the government, such as the Motor\n\n         Vehicles Officer appointed under <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 133-A</a> of the Act or\n\n         of any other department. It could never have been the\n\n         intention of the Central legislature, while enacting Section\n\n         129-A and <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 133-A</a> of the Act that the powers\n\n         exercisable under <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 129-A</a> of the Act could be\n\n         conferred on persons who were not officers of the\n\n         government. If the Central legislature intended that such\n\n         powers could be entrusted to private persons or employees\n\n         of any statutory Corporation the section would have\n\n         expressly provided in that regard. Ordinarily, whenever a\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\"> connected cases                        53</span>\n\n\n\n         statute empowers the State Government to appoint persons\n\n         to administer any of the provisions of the statute, the\n\n         persons who may be appointed by the State Government\n\n         under such provision can only be persons appointed in\n\n         connection with the affairs of the State. In other words they\n\n         should be employees or officers of the State Government,\n\n         who are subject to the administrative and disciplinary control\n\n         of the State Government directly. The powers of search,\n\n         seizure and detention of vehicles belonging to private\n\n         parties and of launching prosecutions are incidental to the\n\n         sovereign powers of the State and they cannot ordinarily be\n\n         entrusted to private persons unless the statute concerned\n\n         makes express provisions in that regard. It is a different\n\n         matter if a private person on his own files a complaint before\n\n         a magistrate and wishes to establish a criminal charge. In\n\n         such a case the private person would not be investigating\n\n         into the crime with the aid of the powers of search, seizure\n\n         or detention. The magistrate may, if he so desires, direct a\n\n         police officer to investigate into the allegations and report to\n\n         him. In order to illustrate the above point reference may be\n\n         made to <a href=\"/doc/73521/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 43</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\"> connected cases                       54</span>\n\n\n\n         1973. It provides that any private person may arrest or\n\n         cause to be arrested any person who in his presence\n\n         commits a non-bailable and cognizable offence, or any\n\n         proclaimed offender, and, without unnecessary delay, shall\n\n         make over or cause to be made over any person so\n\n         arrested to a police officer, or, in the absence of a police\n\n         officer, take such person or cause him to be taken in\n\n         custody to the nearest police station. We are of the view that\n\n         the expression &quot;other person&quot; mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 129-A</a> of\n\n         the Act which has to be read ejusdem generis with the\n\n         words &#x27;any police officer&#x27; which precede that expression in\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 129-A</a> of the Act can only refer to an officer of the\n\n         government and not to any officer or employee of any\n\n         statutory Corporation or to any other private person.

That section also\n\n         provides that any police officer authorized in that behalf or\n\n         other person authorized in that behalf by the State\n\n         Government may, if he has reason to believe that the driver\n\n         of a motor vehicle who is charged with any offence under\n\n         the Act may abscond or otherwise avoid the service of a\n\n         summons, seize any licence held by such driver and\n\n         forward it to the court taking cognizance of the offence and\n\n         the said court shall, on the first appearance of such driver\n\n         before it, return the licence to him in exchange for the\n\n         temporary acknowledgment given under sub-section (3) of\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 129</a> of the Act.

The Latin expression &quot;ejusdem generis&quot; which\n\n         means &quot;of the same kind or nature&quot; is a principle of\n\n         construction, meaning thereby when general words in a\n\n         statutory text are flanked by restricted words, the\n\n         meaning of the general words are taken to be restricted\n\n         by implication with the meaning of the restricted words.\n\n         This is a principle which arises &quot;from the linguistic\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\"> connected cases                      58</span>\n\n\n\n         implication by which words having literally a wide\n\n         meaning (when taken in isolation) are treated as\n\n         reduced in scope by the verbal context&quot;. It may be\n\n         regarded as an instance of ellipsis, or reliance on\n\n         implication. This principle is presumed to apply unless\n\n         there is some contrary indication [see Glanville Williams,\n\n         The Origins and Logical Implications of the Ejusdem\n\n         Generis Rule. 7 Conv (NS) 119].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">         28.     This ejusdem generis principle is a facet of the\n\n         principle of noscitur a sociis. The Latin maxim noscitur a\n\n         sociis contemplates that a statutory term is recognized\n\n         by its associated words. The Latin word &quot;sociis&quot; means\n\n         &quot;society&quot;. Therefore, when general words are juxtaposed\n\n         with specific words, general words cannot be read in\n\n         isolation. Their colour and their contents are to be\n\n         derived from their context. (See similar observations of\n\n         Viscount Simonds in Attorney General v.

The expression ejusdem generis - &#x27;of the\n\n          same kind or nature&#x27; - signifies a principle of construction\n\n          whereby words in a statute which are otherwise wide but\n\n          are associated in the text with more limited words are, by\n\n          implication, given a restricted operation and are limited to\n\n          matters of the same class or genus as preceding them. If a\n\n          list or string or family of genus-describing terms are\n\n          followed by wider or residuary or sweeping-up words, then\n\n          the verbal context and the linguistic implications of the\n\n          preceding words limit the scope of such words.&quot;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">Learned Judges, after referring to Statutory Interpretation by Sir Rupert\n\nCross, made the following observations in paragraph 14:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">                 &quot;14.   The principle underlying this approach to\n\n          statutory construction is that the subsequent general\n\n          words were only intended to guard against some\n\n          accidental omission in the objects of the kind mentioned\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\"> connected cases                         60</span>\n\n\n\n            earlier and were not intended to extend to objects of a\n\n            wholly different kind. This is a presumption and operates\n\n            unless there is some contrary indication. But the\n\n            preceding words or expressions of restricted meaning\n\n            must be susceptible of the import that they represent a\n\n            class. If no class can be found, ejusdem generis rule is\n\n            not attracted and such broad constructions as the\n\n            subsequent words may admit will be favoured. As a\n\n            learned author puts it:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">                        ...........if a class can be found, but the\n\n            specific words exhaust the class, then rejection of the\n\n            rule may be favoured because its adoption would make\n\n            the general words unnecessary; if, however the specific\n\n            words do not exhaust the class, then adoption of the rule\n\n            may be favoured because its rejection would make the\n\n            specific words unnecessary.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">      33.      Sum and substance of the above discussion is that by applying\n\nthe above mentioned well known rules of interpretation of statutes, we are\n\nunable to hold that smuggling of gold simplicitor will fall within <a href=\"/doc/126170422/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 15(1)(a)\n\n(iiia)</a> of UA(P) Act. In other words, gold smuggling clearly covered by the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_128\">Customs Act</a> will not fall within the definition of terrorist act in\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\"> connected cases                        61</span>\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/17471813/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 15</a> of UA(P) Act unless evidence is brought out to show that it is done\n\nwith the intent to threaten or it is likely to threaten the economic security or\n\nmonetary stability of India. In our view, what is made an offence under <a href=\"/doc/126170422/\" id=\"a_130\">Section\n\n15(1)(a)(iiia)</a> of UA(P) Act is causing damage to the monetary stability of India\n\nby way of production or smuggling or circulation of high quality counterfeit\n\nIndian paper currency, coin or any other material relatable to currency or coin.\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">&quot;Other material&quot; can be any material connected to counterfeit Indian paper\n\ncurrency or counterfeit Indian coin, like machinery or implements or high\n\nquality paper or any other material which could be used for producing or\n\ncirculating fake currency or coin. Illegal acts referred to in the above provision\n\ncertainly will have a direct impact on the economic security of India. In our\n\nopinion, it does not include gold as the words employed in the Sub-clause\n\nspecifically mention about production or smuggling or circulation of high\n\nquality counterfeit Indian paper currency or coin and therefore gold cannot be\n\ngrouped along with paper currency or coin even though gold is a valuable\n\nsubstance and has a great potential to get converted into cash. Arrangement\n\nof words indicating the things mentioned in the provision does not prompt us\n\nto think that gold smuggling with a mere illegal profit motive will fall within the\n\naforementioned definition of terrorist act. Besides, we take cognizance of the\n\nfact that there can be many other things of enormous value like precious\n\nmetals and stones that could be smuggled for making an unlawful gain. We do\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\"> connected cases                        62</span>\n\n\n\nnot find any logic to include gold alone along with counterfeit Indian paper\n\ncurrency or coin.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">      34.    One more rule of interpretation of statutes fortifies our view.\n\nCasus omissus, meaning a situation omitted from or not provided by statute,\n\ncannot be supplied by courts, as to do so will be legislation and not\n\nconstruction. Plethora of case law on this subject need not be mentioned here\n\nto buttress this proposition. In our opinion, if the legislature had an intention to\n\ninclude gold smuggling also as terrorist act, there is no difficulty in expressly\n\nproviding a limb to <a href=\"/doc/17471813/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 15</a> of UA(P) Act. We can only presume that the\n\nlegislature must have been aware of the existence of the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_132\">Customs Act</a> when it\n\namended <a href=\"/doc/17471813/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 15</a>. <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_134\">Non-inclusion of the Customs Act in the Schedule to NIA\n\nAct</a> also must be regarded as a conscious act by the legislature. These\n\naspects also strengthen our above view.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_76\">      35.

In <a href=\"/doc/755258/\" id=\"a_135\">the above case</a>, the\n\naccused approached the High Court by presenting a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_136\">Section\n\n482</a> of Cr.P.C. requesting to quash FIR in respect of a crime registered under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/102631007/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 16</a> of UA(P) Act read with <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_138\">Section 120B</a> of the Indian Penal Code,\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\"> connected cases                       63</span>\n\n\n\n1860. Allegation against the accused therein is that he had smuggled huge\n\nquantity of gold. Prosecution therefore contended that he had smuggled gold\n\nwith an intent to threaten the economic security of India as provided in <a href=\"/doc/126170422/\" id=\"a_139\">Section\n\n15(1)(a)(iiia)</a> of UA(P) Act.

Learned single Judge did not\n\naccept this contention. It is observed that smuggling of gold with intent to\n\nthreaten or likely to threaten the economic security of the country is covered\n\nunder the smuggling of &quot;any other material&quot;. It is clear from the decision that\n\nno analysis of the provision was made by the learned single Judge. Moreover,\n\nno specific reason has been stated for making the aforementioned\n\nobservations. It is to be remembered that the learned single Judge was\n\nexamining whether there was any sufficient reason to quash an FIR at the\n\ninitial stage of the investigation.

In <a href=\"/doc/14694700/\" id=\"a_149\">the above decision</a>, the Full Bench\n\nmade the following observations:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">               &quot;19.   No doubt, the property meant and defined\n\n         under <a href=\"/doc/93053806/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 2(h)</a> of the U.A.(P) Act must be something\n\n         having some value in ordinary transactions, whether it is\n\n         tangible or intangible, or movable or immovable or\n\n         corporeal or incorporeal. Valueless objects cannot be\n\n         covered by the term property. The interpretation of the\n\n         Division Bench in Shareef&#x27;s case is that the finance of\n\n         the country is included in the definition of property.\n\n         Finance is a broad term covering so many aspects of\n\n         monetary set up, and it is not something that can be\n\n         simply called property. To be property as meant under\n\n         the law, the object must satisfy the definition of property\n\n         under <a href=\"/doc/93053806/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 2(h)</a> of the U.A.(P) Act. The Division\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\"> connected cases                        65</span>\n\n\n\n         Bench     has   gone    too   far   with   an   imaginative\n\n         interpretation to find that the definition of property under\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/93053806/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 2(h)</a> of the U.A.(P) Act will cover the finance of\n\n         the country also. Finance of the country is something\n\n         different, having broader connotations and applications\n\n         in the country&#x27;s economic set up, and it cannot be\n\n         brought down to a narrow concept or object as property.\n\n         So also, the term &quot;security&quot; occurring in S.15 of the U.A.\n\n         (P) Act cannot be stretched by interpretative process to\n\n         include economic security. To understand what exactly\n\n         security is, as meant by law, the whole section must be\n\n         read and appreciated carefully. It is quite clear from such\n\n         interpretation and understanding that the term security\n\n         meant under the law is the country&#x27;s security vis-a-vis.,\n\n         law and other situations and internal or external affairs of\n\n         the country, and not financial or economic fabric. When\n\n         the parliament in its wisdom realised that economic\n\n         security of the country also must be brought within the\n\n         definition of terrorist act, the Parliament inserted the\n\n         words &#x27;economic security&#x27; specifically in <a href=\"/doc/17471813/\" id=\"a_153\">Section 15</a> of\n\n         the U.A.(P) Act by a specific amendment.

We, thus come to the conclusion and finding that\n\n         production or smuggling or circulation of high quality\n\n         counterfeit Indian paper currency was not punishable till\n\n         01/02/2013 under <a href=\"/doc/102631007/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 16</a> of the U.A.(P) Act as a\n\n         terrorist act defined under <a href=\"/doc/17471813/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 15</a> of the U.A.(P) Act.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">         We also find that the question of law was not properly\n\n         considered and decided in Shareef&#x27;s case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_78\">It is submitted on behalf of NIA that in the Third Schedule, no specification\n\nabout coin has been mentioned. According to NIA, that is one of the\n\nindications to infer that gold smuggling, though not expressly mentioned, also\n\nwill fall within the definition of terrorist act. We are not impressed with this\n\ncontention because mentioning about some matters in the Third Schedule\n\ncannot be taken as a decisive factor to find whether gold smuggling will be a\n\nterrorist act under the Section. The substantive law contained in the Sections\n\ncannot be controlled by the recitals in the Schedule is a well settled legal\n\nprinciple.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">      37.    Another contention raised by NIA is that counterfeit currency\n\nnotes cannot be smuggled because under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_161\">Customs Act</a>, smuggling is an\n\noffence against levying duty. We notice that the word &quot;smuggling&quot; is not\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\"> connected cases                       68</span>\n\n\n\ndefined under the UA(P) Act. Definition of a particular expression occurring in\n\none statute cannot be applied to another, unless they are pari materia. This is\n\nan indisputable proposition. We do not think that the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_162\">Customs Act</a> and UA(P)\n\nAct are pari materia. Going by the dictionary meaning, &quot;smuggling&quot; is the\n\nillegal transportation of objects, substances, information or people, such as\n\nout of a house or building, into a prison or across an international border in\n\nviolation of the applicable laws or other regulations. Cambridge Dictionary\n\ndefines the word &quot;smuggling&quot; as an act or process of taking things or people\n\nto or from a place secretly and often illegally. In all cases, smuggling need not\n\nbe in respect of articles on which a duty could be levied. For example, narcotic\n\ndrugs or other contraband articles are smuggled at times on which no duty\n\ncould be levied. In our opinion, &quot;smuggling&quot; is a generic term indicating the\n\nillegal transport of various articles. Therefore, this argument raised by NIA\n\ncannot be accepted. We are therefore of the view that the learned trial Judge\n\nis right in holding that the materials presented before the court at the time of\n\nconsidering the bail application did not reveal prima facie that the accused\n\npersons released on bail are involved in a terrorist act, as defined under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/17471813/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 15</a> of the UA(P) Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">      38.    Learned trial Judge has observed that the case diary produced by\n\nNIA in six volumes consist of nearly 2500 pages and on scanning through the\n\nmaterials, the court below found that the persons to whom it had granted bail\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\"> connected cases                       69</span>\n\n\n\nhad funded the front line accused persons for smuggling gold through\n\ndiplomatic channel and they did conspire with some others in this regard. The\n\nmaterials on record prima facie did not indicate that the accused to whom bail\n\nhad been granted had acted with an intention to damage economic security of\n\nIndia. Trial court took note of the fact that most of the accused persons are\n\nbusinessmen having considerable assets. The materials on record revealed\n\nthat the accused, who are enlarged on bail, were indulging in smuggling\n\nactivity for illegal gain. Of course, they were using a diplomatic channel for\n\ncommitting the offence of smuggling. On going through the materials placed\n\nbefore us, we are of the view that the court below is justified in entering such a\n\nfinding.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">      39.     Learned ASG harping on Section 43-D(5) of UA(P) Act contended\n\nthat the court below did not comply with the mandate of law therein. Section\n\n43-D(5) of UA(P) Act reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">                 &quot;43-D. Modified application of certain provisions\n\n            of the Code.-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">                 ..............\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">                 (5) Notwithstanding anything contained in the Code,\n\n            no person accused of an offence punishable under\n\n            Chapters IV and VI of this Act shall, if in custody, be\n\n            released on bail or on his own bond unless the Public\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\"> connected cases                           70</span>\n\n\n\n            Prosecutor has been given an opportunity of being heard\n\n            on the application for such release :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">                        Provided that such accused person shall not\n\n            be released on bail or on his own bond if the Court, on a\n\n            perusal of the case diary or the report made under section\n\n            173 of the Code is of the opinion that there are reasonable\n\n            grounds for believing that the accusation against such\n\n            person is prima facie true.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">What is important about the above provision is the expression, &quot;where there\n\nare reasonable grounds for believing that the accusation against such person\n\nis prima facie true&quot;. Sub-section (6) to Section 43-D of UA(P) Act makes it\n\nclear that the restriction on granting bail specified in Sub-section (5) is in\n\naddition to the restrictions under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_164\">Cr.P.C</a>. or any other law for the time being\n\nin force.   On a look at Section 43-D(2) of UA(P) Act, it will be clear that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_165\">Section 167</a> of Cr.P.C. has been modified to the extent provided therein. So,\n\nthe court will have to consider the existence of a prima facie case in a different\n\nperspective than what is provided under the provisions of Cr.P.C.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">      40.     On a reappraisal of the entire materials, we agree with the\n\nlearned trial Judge that the materials produced before the court at that point of\n\ntime are insufficient to hold prima facie that the accused persons have\n\ncommitted a terrorist act. We shall not be understood as declaring that the\n Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\"> connected cases                        71</span>\n\n\n\naccused persons have not committed any of the offences alleged against\n\nthem. We make it clear that we are only endorsing the trial court&#x27;s view that\n\nthe materials placed before it for considering the bail plea are insufficient to\n\nhold prima facie that those released accused were involved in any terrorist\n\nact. We make it further clear that none of the observations in this judgment will\n\npreclude the investigating agency from collecting any evidence to establish\n\nthe involvement of the accused in any of the offences alleged. Likewise, the\n\ninvestigating agency is free to take all steps to convince the trial court that the\n\naccused are liable for all the offences alleged in the final report. Moreover, we\n\ncaution the court below not to be influenced by any of the observations in this\n\njudgment at the time of trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_84\">      41.    On a perusal of the operative portion of the bail order, we find that\n\nthe trial court has carefully taken enough precautions to see that the accused\n\npersons, to whom bail had been granted, are obeying the directions and they\n\ndo not interfere with progress of the investigation. Similarly, measures have\n\nbeen taken in the bail order by imposing necessary conditions to secure their\n\npresence at the time of trial. Therefore, we find no reason to think that the\n\naccused to whom bail had been granted will flee from justice or meddle with\n\nthe investigation. Moreover, the investigating agency, if succeeds in digging\n\nout materials to show their complicity in a terrorist act, certainly can move the\n\ncourt for cancellation of bail.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\"> Crl.Appeal No.826 of 2020 and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\"> connected cases                       72</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">      42.    Insofar as the appeal preferred by 7th accused is concerned, the\n\ncourt below for valid reasons declined his bail plea. In paragraph 25 of the\n\nimpugned order the trial court considered various distinctions between the\n\ncase against 7th accused and other accused to whom bail was granted. Case\n\ndiary clearly revealed that 7th accused played a pivotal role in the alleged\n\nconspiracy. Various accused persons obtained smuggled gold through 7th\n\naccused. Allegations against him are certainly graver than those against the\n\naccused who were enlarged on bail. Therefore the court below rightly declined\n\nhis bail plea.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">             In the result, the appeals under consideration are dismissed\n\naffirming
