The necessary facts for the disposal of the present\nappeal in short are that on 25-3-2006, at about 10 P.M., the\ncomplainant Ram Kishore was in his house. The appellant\ncame there along with his 12 bore single barrel licensed gun\nand asked for C.D. The complainant replied that the T.V. has\nbeen taken by Jaiveer Singh and C.D. has been kept inside the\nhouse by his father. On hearing the reply of the complainant,\nthe appellant started abusing the complainant. The deceased\nobjected to it, then the appellant with an intention to kill\nSurendra Singh, fired a gun shot causing injury in the stomach\nof the deceased as a result of which the deceased fell down on\nthe ground. The appellant thereafter again fired two gun shots\nand threatened that no one should go to lodge the F.I.R. and\nsat on the road. As a result of which the complainant could not\ngo to the Police Station for lodging the F.I.R. In the morning,\nan information was given to the S.H.O., on telephone. The\npolice party came to the village.               Dehati Nalishi Ex. P.6 was\nlodged by the complainant and F.I.R. Ex. P.18 was lodged. The\noffence was registered. The appellant was arrested. After\ncompleting the investigation, the police filed the charge sheet\nagainst the appellant for offence under Sections 302,294,341\nof I.P.C.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">3.    The Trial Court framed charges under Sections 302,506\nPart II, 341, and 294 of I.P.C.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">4.    The appellant abjured his guilt and pleaded not guilty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.    The prosecution examined Dr. D.K. Pandeya (P.W.1),\nPratap Bhan Khanna (P.W.2), Head Constable Raghvendra\nSingh       (P.W.3),    Dr.   C.R.       Raje     (P.W.4),    Anandswaroop\nShrivastava (P.W.5), Ramkishore Singh Bhadoriya (P.W.6),\nHead Constable Indrapal Singh (P.W.7), Harikishore @ Guddu\n(P.W.8), Constable Dharmendra Singh (P.W.9), S.I. P.S.Parmar\n(P.W.10),     Jagdish    Singh   (P.W.11),         S.I.

The\nappellant did not examine any witness in his defence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">6.   The Trial Court by judgment and sentence dated 5-5-\n2008 passed by Sessions Judge, Bhind in Sessions Trial No.\n174/2006, convicted the appellant under Sections 302, 294,\n341, 506 Part II of I.P.C.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">7.   Challenging the judgment of conviction and sentence\npassed by the Trial Court , it is submitted by the Counsel for\nthe appellant that the prosecution has failed to prove the guilt\nof the appellant beyond reasonable doubt.       Even otherwise,\nthe incident is alleged to have taken place all of a sudden\nwithout any premeditation. The appellant is alleged to have\nfired a single gun shot because of sudden and grave\nprovocation. At the most, the act of the appellant would be an\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/690321/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 304</a> Part I of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_7\">I.P.C</a>. and the appellant is\nin jail from the date of arrest and has undergone near about\n11 years of actual jail sentence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">8.   Per contra, it is submitted by the Counsel for the State\nthat the appellant went to the house of the complainant and\ndemanded for C.D. When the complainant informed that his\nfather (Deceased) has kept the C.D. inside the house, then\nwithout there being any provocation, the appellant started\nhurling abuses.   When the act of the appellant was objected\nby Surendra Singh (deceased), then a gun shot was fired\ncausing injury in the stomach of the deceased. The deceased\nimmediately fell down. Thereafter the appellant not only\nrestrained the complainant from lodging the Police Report but\nalso did not allow them to shift the deceased to a Hospital and\nsat on the road and in order to threaten the witnesses, had\nfired two more gun shots in air. Thus, if the entire allegations\nare considered, then it would be clear that the act of the\nappellant would be &quot; murder&quot; only.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">9.   Heard the learned Counsel for the parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">                               4        Criminal Appeal No.491 of 2008\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">10. The first question for determination would be that\nwhether the death of deceased Surendra Singh was homicidal\nin nature or not?\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">11. Dr. C.R. Raje (P.W.4) had conducted the postmortem of\nthe dead body of the deceased Surendra Singh. He had found\nthe following injuries :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">         &quot;A part of intestine present over the\n         abdominal wall. Present of a lacerated\n         rounded in shape, Margin are burnt and\n         inverted 2 1/2 cms. In diameter that is entry\n         wound. Lt. Scrotum swollen and full of blood.\n         No any other external injury detected.\n         Above entry wound is antimortem in nature\n         and dangerous to life.     Duration with 24\n         hours.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">               The abdominal muscles and small\n         intestine and large intestine were ruptured.\n         Pelvic bone was found fractured.

P.4.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">12. This witness was cross examined in short.            In cross\nexamination, Dr. Raje (P.W.4) has stated that the gun shot\nwas fired from a distance of 8 feets as blackening was not\nfound. He has explained that since at the time of entry, the\nbullet was hot therefore, the margins of entry wound were\nfound burnt. He further explained that since blackening was\nnot found therefore, the gun shot was fired from a distance of\nmore than 8 feets.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">13. Thus, it is clear that the deceased Surendra Singh had\ndied a homicidal death due to gun shot injury in his stomach.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">14. The next question for determination is that whether the\nappellant had caused gun shot injury to the deceased\nSurendra Singh or not?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">15. Ram Kishore Bhadoriya (P.W.6), Harikishore @ Guddu\n                                5        Criminal Appeal No.491 of 2008\n\n(P.W.8), Jagdish Singh (P.W.11) are the eye witnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">16. It is submitted by the Counsel for the appellant, that all\nthe three eye witnesses are related to each other.             Ram\nKishore Bhadoriya (P.W.6) and Harikishore @ Guddu (P.W.8)\nare real brothers and are the sons of the deceased whereas\nJagdish Singh (P.W.11) is their uncle, therefore, their evidence\nis not trust worthy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">17. The submission made by the Counsel for the appellant\ncannot be accepted because the evidence of a &quot;related\nwitness&quot; cannot be rejected merely on the ground that he is\nrelated to the deceased. On the contrary, in the present case,\nthe incident is alleged to have taken place in the house of the\nwitnesses and their presence in the house is natural. Merely a\nwitness is a related to the deceased, cannot be said to be\n&quot;interested witness&quot;. On the contrary, why a related witness\nwould falsely implicate the accused by sparing the real culprit?\nFurther more, the F.S.L. report also shows that the empty\ncartridge found on the spot was fired from the licensed gun of\nthe appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160542249\" id=\"span_1\">18.

Ram Kishore Bhadoriya (P.W.6), Harikishore @ Guddu\n(P.W.8), Jagdish Singh (P.W.11), have stated that on 25-3-\n2006 at about 10 P.M., the appellant came to their house and\nasked for C.D.   Ram Kishore Bhadoriya (P.W.6) replied that\nthe T.V. has been taken by Jaiveer Singh and the C.D. has\nbeen kept by his father (deceased) in the house. The\nappellant started hurling abuses. When his father objected to\nit, the appellant fired a gun shot causing injury in the\nabdomen of Surendra Singh, who fell down on the ground.\nThereafter, the appellant fired two more gun shots from a\ndistance and threatened that he would see that who will lodge\nthe F.I.R. As this witness was frightened, therefore, didnot go\nfor lodging the F.I.R. His brother Harikishore @ Guddu (P.W.8)\nand his wife were also present on the spot. On the next day,\nhe informed the police on phone and then the police came\n                               7        Criminal Appeal No.491 of 2008\n\nthere. Dehati Nalishi Ex. P.5 was lodged. Spot Map Ex. P.8,\nSafina form Ex. P.9, Inquest Report Ex.P.10, seizure memo Ex.\nP.11 and receipt of dead body Ex. P.12 bears his signatures. In\ncross   examination,   Ram   Kishore   Bhadoriya    (P.W.6)     has\nexplained that as he was not aware of the phone number of\nthe police, therefore, could not inform the police in the night.\nOn next day at about 6-6:15 A.M., he informed Umari Police\nStation from the house of Bhikam Master as he was not aware\nof the phone number of Bhikam Master also. The phone\nnumber of the police station was told by Indu, who is running\na S.T.D. Shop. He had a talk with some constable posted in\nthe police station. The police had reached on the spot at\naround 7-7:15 A.M. An empty cartridge was also recovered\nfrom the spot.   The plain and blood stained blood was also\nseized by the investigating officer.   The spot map was also\nprepared.   He had not disclosed the place where he was\nstanding or his father was standing. However, he had\ninformed the police that at the time of firing, he, his brother\nand his wife were present on the spot. He had also informed\nthe police about the place from where the gun shot was fired\nby the appellant. Although this witness was cross examined\nin detail but nothing could be elicited from his cross\nexamination, which may make his evidence unreliable.           The\nevidence of Harikishore @ Guddu (P.W.8), and Jagdish Singh\n(P.W.11) is almost in similar lines. The Counsel for the\nappellant could not point out that how the evidence of these\nwitnesses is unreliable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">20. P.S. Parmar (P.W.10) has stated that on 26-3-2006, he\nwas posted as S.I., in police station Umari. An information was\ngiven by Rakishore Singh of village Kotaknavar that the\nappellant after hurling abuses, has killed Surendra Singh by\ncausing gun shot injury, which was registered at &quot;Zero&quot;. They\nwent to the spot and recorded the Dehati Nalishi Ex. P.2. The\n                                8         Criminal Appeal No.491 of 2008\n\ntelephonic information given by Ramkishore is Ex. P.7. The\nspot map Ex. P.8 was prepared.        Safina form Ex. P.15 was\nprepared. Inquest report Ex. P.10 was prepared. The blood\nstained and plain earth and empty cartridge were seized by\nseizure memo Ex. P.11.      Application for Postmortem is Ex.\nP.16.   In cross examination, this witness has stated that he\nhad received the information in the police station at about 6\nA.M., which was recorded in the Rojnamcha sanha. The dead\nbody was lying at a distance of about 5-6 feets away from the\nhouse of the complainant. The house of Jagdish is situated at\na distance of 8-10 feets and is situated on the other side of\nthe street. The empty cartridge was seized from a place which\nis about 20 meters away from the place of incident. The\ncomplainant had disclosed the place from where the appellant\nhad fired the gun shot and that is also mentioned in the spot\nmap.    He had not measured the distance between the place\nwhere the appellant was standing and the place of incident.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">21. Constable Makhanlal Khanna (P.W.2) had brought the\ncloths of the deceased as well as bullet recovered from the\nbody of the deceased from the hospital and had handed over\nto Head constable Brijraj Singh and the said articles were\nseized by seizure memo Ex. P.2.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">22. The 12 bore single barrel licensed gun, two live\ncartridges, two empty cartridges, photo copy of the license\nwas seized and were sealed in different cloths.        The seizure\nmemo is Ex P.3.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">23. Dharmendra Singh (P.W.9) is the witness of seizure. He\nhas stated that a confessional statement was made by the\nappellant to the investigating officer Ex. P.13.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">24. The licensed gun and the empty cartridges, including the\ncartridge which was found on the spot were sent to F.S.L.\nSagar. By report dated 29-9-2006, the Senior Scientific Officer\nhad opined that the empty cartridges were fired from the\n                                 9           Criminal Appeal No.491 of 2008\n\nseized gun and the gun powder was present in the barrel of\nthe gun, which clearly shows that the gun shots were fired\nfrom the licensed gun. Although the prosecution has failed to\nprove that how the gun was seized from the possession of the\nappellant, but the fact that licensed gun was used in\ncommitting offence and the appellant was the custodian of the\nsaid gun, therefore, the burden was on him to prove that he\nhad not used the said gun. The burden has not been\ndischarged by the appellant.        Thus, it is proved scientifically\nalso, that the licensed gun of the appellant was used for\ncommitting offence. Further, it is well established principle of\nlaw that a faulty investigation or lapse on the part of the\ninvestigating officer, would not be sufficient to throw out a\ncredible prosecution version.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">25. Thus, this Court is of the considered opinion that the\nprosecution has succeeded in establishing beyond reasonable\ndoubt that the appellant went to the house of Ramkishore\n(P.W.6) along with his licensed gun and asked for C.D. When\nRamkishore (P.W.6) informed that T.V. has been taken away\nby Jaiveer Singh and his father has kept the C.D. inside the\nhouse, then the appellant started hurling abuses. When the\nfather of Ramkishore (P.W.6) objected to it, the appellant fired\na gun shot causing injury in the abdominal region of the\ndeceased, who fell down. Thereafter, the appellant fired two\nmore gunshots for some distance and had threatened that no\none should lodge the report.        On the next day, a telephonic\ninformation was given by Ram Kishore to the police. The\npolice came on the spot and completed the formalities,\nincluding seizure of one empty cartridge. The seized gun,\nempty cartridges were sent to F.S.L. Sagar and it was found\nthat the empty cartridges were fired from the licensed gun of\nthe appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">26. Now the question for determination is that what is the\n                                  10         Criminal Appeal No.491 of 2008\n\nnature of offence committed by the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">27. It is submitted by the Counsel for the appellant that\naccording to the prosecution case, the appellant had gone to\nthe house of Ramkishore for taking C.D. and some hot\naltercation   took    place     and   under    sudden      and    grave\nprovocation, he caused single gun shot injury to the deceased.\nTherefore,    the    act   of   the   appellant   would    fall   under\nexplanation 4 of Section 300 of I.P.C. and would be culpable\nhomicide not amounting to murder and therefore, the offence\nis liable to converted under Section 304 Part I of I.P.C. from\noffence under Section 302 of I.P.C.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"157002074\" id=\"span_4\">28.

State\nof Punjab</a> reported in (2015) 16 SCC 337 has held as\nunder:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">         &quot;7. After having considered the material on\n         record, the High Court concluded that the\n         prosecution was successful in establishing\n         that the deceased died as a result of shots\n         fired by the appellant. While considering\n         whether the instant matter came within the\n         purview of &quot;sudden and grave provocation&quot;,\n         the High Court found that there was nothing\n         on record to indicate in what circumstances\n         and what was the cause for the deceased to\n         have abused the appellant. It was further\n         observed that if the appellant wanted to\n         derive benefit or advantage under the first\n         Exception to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 300</a> IPC, then the onus\n         squarely rested on his shoulder, which onus\n         was not discharged by the appellant at all.\n         The High Court further observed that given\n         the eyewitness account, four shots were fired\n                             11        Criminal Appeal No.491 of 2008\n\n        by the appellant which could again be\n        inconsistent with the theory of any\n        instantaneous reaction to any sudden and\n        grave provocation. Allowing the appeal\n        preferred by the State, the High Court thus\n        convicted and sentenced the appellant for the\n        offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 302</a> IPC.\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">                     *         *     *    *\n        9.

It is worthwhile to note that in\n        his statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 313</a> of the Code\n        of Criminal Procedure, the accused has come\n        out with complete denial including the denial\n        of his presence at the place of occurrence\n        itself. He has chosen not to lead any positive\n        evidence from his side. It is true that the\n        plea of sudden and grave provocation can\n        still be proved by him provided there is\n        material on record. In that view of the\n        matter, if we analyse the material, both the\n        eyewitnesses, namely, PW 2 Anil Chhabra\n        and PW 3 Gurbachan Singh are quite cogent\n        and consistent that there was an altercation\n        and that soon thereafter the appellant took\n        out his licensed weapon and fired upon the\n        deceased. Even if we were to accept that any\n        abuses were hurled by the deceased,\n        questions such as who was responsible for\n        such verbal altercation, who had initiated\n        such verbal altercation, what was the extent\n        of such abuse, whether such abuses would,\n        in normal circumstances, have provoked a\n        reasonable minded person still remain\n        unanswered. These are issues which ought to\n        have been proved by way of positive\n        evidence or inferences clearly discernible\n        from the record. We do not find any material\n        even suggesting such inferences. In our view,\n        the High Court was completely right and\n        justified in negating the plea of &quot;sudden and\n        grave provocation&quot;. We, therefore, affirm the\n        view taken by the High Court and dismiss the\n        present appeal.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"559280\" id=\"span_6\">30.

After due consideration of the rival\n         submissions, we are of the view that the High\n         Court has clearly erred in holding that the\n         offence falls under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 304</a> Part I <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_19\">IPC</a>. It\n         is clear from the case of the prosecution\n         mentioned above that the accused first\n         slapped the complainant which was followed\n         by verbal abuses and thereafter the accused\n         brought the licensed gun and fired at the\n         deceased, who died. It was, thus, a voluntary\n         and intentional act of the accused which\n         caused the death. Intention is a matter of\n         inference and when death is as a result of\n         intentional firing, intention to cause death is\n         patent unless the case falls under any of the\n         exceptions. We are unable to hold that the\n         case falls under Exception 4 to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 300</a>\n         IPC as submitted by the learned counsel for\n         the respondent. Exception 4 is attracted only\n         when there is a fight or quarrel which\n         requires mutual provocation and blows by\n         both sides in which the offender does not\n         take undue advantage. In the present case,\n         there is no giving of any blow by the\n         complainant side. The complainant side did\n         not have any weapon. The accused went to\n         his house and brought a gun. There is neither\n         sudden fight nor a case where the accused\n         has not taken undue advantage.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">         10. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"605891\" id=\"span_8\">In <a href=\"/doc/605891/\" id=\"a_21\">State of A.P. v.

In the scheme of the Penal Code,\n         &#x27;culpable homicide&#x27; is genus and &#x27;murder&#x27; its\n         specie. All &#x27;murder&#x27; is &#x27;culpable homicide&#x27; but\n         not vice versa.

For the purpose of fixing\n         punishment, proportionate to the gravity of\n         this generic offence, the Code practically\n                      13        Criminal Appeal No.491 of 2008\n\nrecognises     three    degrees    of   culpable\nhomicide.

The confusion is\ncaused, if courts losing sight of the true\nscope and meaning of the terms used by the\nlegislature    in    these    sections,    allow\nthemselves to be drawn into minute\nabstractions. The safest way of approach to\nthe interpretation and application of these\nprovisions seems to be to keep in focus the\nkeywords used in the various clauses of\n<a href=\"/doc/305371/\" id=\"a_25\">Sections 299</a> and <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_26\">300</a>.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">11. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1356415\" id=\"span_9\">In <a href=\"/doc/1356415/\" id=\"a_27\">Bhagwan Munjaji Pawade v.

For bringing in operation of Exception 4\nto <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 300</a> IPC, it has to be established\nthat the act was committed without\npremeditation, in a sudden fight in the heat\nof passion upon a sudden quarrel without the\noffender having taken undue advantage and\nnot having acted in a cruel or unusual\nmanner.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">8. The fourth exception to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 300</a> IPC\ncovers acts done in a sudden fight. The said\nexception deals with a case of prosecution\nnot covered by the first exception, after\nwhich its place would have been more\nappropriate. The exception is founded upon\nthe same principle, for in both there is\nabsence of premeditation. But, while in the\ncase of Exception 1 there is total deprivation\nof self-control, in case of Exception 4, there\nis only that heat of passion which clouds\nmen&#x27;s sober reason and urges them to deeds\nwhich they would not otherwise do. There is\nprovocation in Exception 4 as in Exception 1;\nbut the injury done is not the direct\nconsequence of that provocation. In fact\nException 4 deals with cases in which\nnotwithstanding that a blow may have been\nstruck, or some provocation given in the\norigin of the dispute or in whatever way the\nquarrel may have originated, yet the\nsubsequent conduct of both parties puts\nthem in respect of guilt upon equal footing. A\n&#x27;sudden fight&#x27; implies mutual provocation and\nblows on each side. The homicide committed\nis then clearly not traceable to unilateral\nprovocation, nor in such cases could the\nwhole blame be placed on one side. For if it\nwere so, the exception more appropriately\napplicable would be Exception 1. There is no\nprevious deliberation or determination to\nfight. A fight suddenly takes place, for which\nboth parties are more or less to be blamed.\nIt may be that one of them starts it, but if\nthe other had not aggravated it by his own\nconduct it would not have taken the serious\nturn it did. There is then mutual provocation\nand aggravation, and it is difficult to\napportion the share of blame which attaches\nto each fighter. The help of Exception 4 can\nbe invoked if death is caused: (a) without\n                        15        Criminal Appeal No.491 of 2008\n\n   premeditation; (b) in a sudden fight; (c)\n   without the offender&#x27;s having taken undue\n   advantage or acted in a cruel or unusual\n   manner; and (d) the fight must have been\n   with the person killed. To bring a case within\n   Exception 4 all the ingredients mentioned in\n   it must be found. It is to be noted that the\n   &#x27;fight&#x27; occurring in Exception 4 to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 300</a>\n   IPC is not defined in <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_33\">IPC</a>. It takes two to\n   make a fight. Heat of passion requires that\n   there must be no time for the passions to\n   cool down and in this case, the parties have\n   worked themselves into a fury on account of\n   the verbal altercation in the beginning. A\n   fight is a combat between two and more\n   persons whether with or without weapons. It\n   is not possible to enunciate any general rule\n   as to what shall be deemed to be a sudden\n   quarrel. It is a question of fact and whether a\n   quarrel is sudden or not must necessarily\n   depend upon the proved facts of each case.\n   For the application of Exception 4, it is not\n   sufficient to show that there was a sudden\n   quarrel and there was no premeditation. It\n   must further be shown that the offender has\n   not taken undue advantage or acted in a\n   cruel or unusual manner. The expression\n   &#x27;undue advantage&#x27; as used in the provision\n   means &#x27;unfair advantage&#x27;.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"114186994\" id=\"span_11\">13.

In both these\n          cases it is clearly laid down that the\n          prosecution must prove (1) that the body\n          injury is present, (2) that the injury is\n          sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to\n          cause death, (3) that the accused intended\n                       18          Criminal Appeal No.491 of 2008\n\nto inflict that particular injury, that is to say it\nwas not accidental or unintentional or that\nsome other kind of injury was intended. In\nother words clause Thirdly consists of two\nparts. The first part is that there was an\nintention to inflict the injury that is found to\nbe present and the second part that the said\ninjury is sufficient to cause death in the\nordinary course of nature. Under the first\npart the prosecution has to prove from the\ngiven facts and circumstances that the\nintention of the accused was to cause that\nparticular injury. Whereas under the second\npart whether it was sufficient to cause death,\nis an objective enquiry and it is a matter of\ninference or deduction from the particulars of\nthe injury. The language of clause Thirdly of\n<a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 300</a> speaks of intention at two places\nand in each the sequence is to be established\nby the prosecution before the case can fall in\nthat clause. The &#x27;intention&#x27; and &#x27;knowledge&#x27;\nof the accused are subjective and invisible\nstates of mind and their existence has to be\ngathered from the circumstances, such as\nthe weapon used, the ferocity of attack,\nmultiplicity of injuries and all other\nsurrounding circumstances. The framers of\nthe Code designedly used the words\n&#x27;intention&#x27; and &#x27;knowledge&#x27; and it is accepted\nthat the knowledge of the consequences\nwhich may result in doing an act is not the\nsame thing as the intention that such\nconsequences should ensue. Firstly, when an\nact is done by a person, it is presumed that\nhe must have been aware that certain\nspecified harmful consequences would or\ncould follow. But that knowledge is bare\nawareness and not the same thing as\nintention that such consequences should\nensue.      As    compared      to    &#x27;knowledge&#x27;,\n&#x27;intention&#x27; requires something more than the\nmere foresight of the consequences, namely,\nthe purposeful doing of a thing to achieve a\nparticular end.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">12. The emphasis in clause three of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_49\">Section\n300</a> IPC is on the sufficiency of the injury in\nthe ordinary course of nature to cause death.\nThe sufficiency is the high probability of\ndeath in the ordinary course of nature. When\n                               19         Criminal Appeal No.491 of 2008\n\n          the sufficiency exists and death follows,\n          causing of such injury is intended and\n          causing of such offence is murder. For\n          ascertaining the sufficiency of the injury,\n          sometimes the nature of the weapon used,\n          sometimes the part of the body on which the\n          injury is caused and sometimes both are\n          relevant. Depending on the nature of weapon\n          used and situs of the injury, in some cases,\n          the sufficiency of injury to cause death in the\n          ordinary course of nature must be proved\n          and cannot be inferred from the fact that\n          death has, in fact, taken place.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_41\">33. Thus, if the facts of this case are considered, then it\nwould be clear that the appellant went to the house of\ndeceased along with his licensed gun, for taking C.D. As the\nT.V. was already taken away by Jaiveer Singh, therefore, Ram\nKishore (P.W.1) informed that Jaiveer Singh has taken away\nthe T.V. and the C.D. has been kept by his father inside the\nhouse. It is not the case, that the appellant had gone to take\nhis C.D. back from Ramkishore. If Ramkishore was not inclined\nto give his C.D. to the appellant, then the appellant had no\nbusiness to start hurling abuses. The deceased was inside the\nhouse and he objected to the act of the appellant and without\nany provocation on the part of the deceased or prosecution\nwitnesses, the appellant fired a gun shot causing injury in the\nstomach of the deceased. The deceased fell down. Thereafter,\nthe appellant again fired two gun shots from some distance\nand threatened that no body should go to lodge the report.\nThe manner in which the incident is said to have taken place,\nit is clear that the appellant had fired gun shot with an\nintention to cause death and the injury sustained by the\ndeceased was sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of\nnature.   Thus, the act of the appellant cannot be converted\ninto Section 304 Part I of I.P.C. from Section 302 of I.P.C.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">34. Accordingly, it is held that the appellant is guilty of\ncommitting murder under Section 302 of I.P.C.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">                                           20       Criminal Appeal No.491 of 2008\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">            35. So far as the other offences for which the appellant has\n            been convicted, no submissions were advanced by the Counsel\n            for the appellant.     Even otherwise, the evidence which has\n            come on record, clearly establishes beyond reasonable doubt\n            that the appellant is also guilty of committing offence under\n            Sections 294,341 and 506 Part II of I.P.C.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">            36. The minimum sentence provided for offence under\n            <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 302</a> of I.P.C. is Life imprisonment and therefore, no\n            interference can be made on the question of sentence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">            37. Accordingly, the judgment and sentence dated 5-5-2008\n            passed by Sessions Judge, Bhind in Sessions Trial No.\n            174/2006 is hereby affirmed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">            38. The appellant is in jail as he was never released on bail.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">            39.
