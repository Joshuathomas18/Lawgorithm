The\n\nfirst category was the hardcore terrorists who were\n\ndirected to be dealt with strictly, while in the\n\nother cases it was recommended that a liberal view\n\nbe taken.

The other\n\nlabourers who were involved in such operation are\n\nsaid   to     have    been     granted         bail   as   they      had     no\n\nknowledge of the contents of the said boxes and\n\nwere merely shifting the same on instructions.                               As\n\nfar    as     the    appellant       -        Jivan   Raghu        Varli     is\n\nconcerned, he allegedly being in the employment of\n\nIzharul Haq Abdul Hamid Shaikh, a presumption was\n\ndrawn while denying him bail that he presumably had\n\nknowledge       of        contents       of     the   boxes.         Without\n\ncommenting on that aspect of the matter, which is\n\nthe subject matter of the trial, we are of the view\n\nthat since the other labourers have been granted\n\nbail    and    there       being     no       available    material          to\n\npresume that Jivan Raghu Varli had knowledge of the\n\ncontents of the boxes, he may be granted bail on a\n\nparity with the other labourers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_42\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">25.

What will be the\n\neffect    of    the   same    will   ultimately    have   to    be\n\ndecided in the trial and we are not embarking on\n\nsuch exercise at the present moment.               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1574068\" id=\"span_26\">However, for\n\nthe purpose of grant of bail, having regard to the\n\ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/1574068/\" id=\"a_45\">Mukhtiar Ahmad Ansari</a>&#x27;s case (supra) in\n\nwhich the question of grant of prior approval, as\n\nrequired under Section 20-A(1), had been considered\n\nand was held to be a pre-condition for recording\n\nthe First Information Report, we are inclined to\n\ngrant bail to the appellant Izharul Haq Abdul Hamid\n\nShaikh, since undoubtedly, approval had not been\n\nobtained under Section 20-A(1) of TADA before the\n\nFirst Information Report was recorded.</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">26.
