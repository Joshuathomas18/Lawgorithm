The facts necessary for disposal of present appeal in short are that\nthe complainant Hariom lodged a Dehati Nalishi on 17-7-2006 at 1:00\nA.M. in the night on the allegations that, Sughar Singh is his younger\nbrother and was a Councilor from Ward No. 25, Jaderua. An enmity had\ndeveloped between his family and the family of Rustam Singh Yadav on\nthe question of elections. During the elections, Rustam Singh had fired\nat his brother and from thereafter, Rustam, Mahendra and their father\nSitaram had shifted from the village and were hatching conspiracy for\nkilling Sughar Singh. About 4-5 months back, Sughar Singh had come to\nknow about the conspiracy hatched by Sitaram, Rustam and Mahendra,\nand accordingly, he had a dispute with Sitaram. Day before yesterday,\nCheeku, Mohar Singh and Kallu had come to the house on a Cream\ncolour Scorpio jeep and had collected information about Sughar Singh.\nThis witness had warned Sughar Singh. At about 8:30 in the night, the\ncomplainant had gone towards Pinto Park and was standing near Bajrang\nKirana Store. He heard the noise of gun shots and saw that gun shots\nwere being fired on his Safari vehicle. Rustam, Mohar Singh, Kallu,\nCheeku @ Mohan Singh, Balli son of Shivcharan came down from the\ncream coloured Scorpio. Cheeku, Balli and Kallu were having .315 bore\nguns, whereas Mohar Singh was having .12 bore and Rustam was\nhaving .315 mouzer. They started firing indiscriminately and attacked on\nhis brother Sughar Singh as a result, Jagdish, the driver lost his life on\nthe spot itself, whereas he took his brother to the hospital, where he was\ndeclared dead, Yuvraj is getting himself treated as he is injured and one\nmore person namely Sintu has also died in shootout. 3-4 more persons\nwere with Rustam Singh who had also deboarded from the vehicle and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                     14</span>\n\nwere armed with firearms and had also fired. Thereafter, all the accused\npersons went away in their Scorpio vehicle. It was also alleged that this\nincident has been committed by Rustam Singh and his companions at the\ninstigation of and in conspiracy with Sitaram Yadav, Mahendra Yadav. It\nwas also stated that he would disclose the names of other unknown\npersons after collecting information in this regard.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.

It is not out of place to mention here, that since, the incident took\nplace on the public place which was just 1 ½ Km away from the Police\nStation Gola Ka Mandir, therefore, immediately after the shoot out, the\npolice also reached on the spot after getting telephonic information\nwhich was reduced in Rojnamcha Sanha. They prepared the spot map.\nThe injured Yuvraj was taken to hospital by his friends. The Safari car\nwas also seized from the spot on 16-7-2006 itself and as many as 16\nbullet marks were found on the front and right side of the vehicle. Blood\nstained pieces of flesh were found on the seats. One .315 bore rifle was\nalso found in the jeep. The rifle was in a damaged condition due to gun\nshot.

The\nAppellant Mohar Singh has proved his plea of alibi beyond reasonable\ndoubt, but the Trial Court has rejected the same on flimsy grounds. It is\nfurther submitted that the entire prosecution story is based on the solitary\nevidence of Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) and since he is not a reliable witness\ntherefore, the case is based on circumstantial evidence and the\nprosecution has failed to prove the same beyond reasonable doubt. It is\nwell established principle of law that when two views are possible, then\nthe version favoring the accused should be accepted.

Counsel for the State submitted that Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) is an\ninjured eye-witness and thus, he enjoys a special status. It is clear from\nthe various order-sheets of the Trial Court, that the main accused Rustam\nSingh was not appearing before the Trial Court from 22-11-2008 and\nultimately his bail bonds were cancelled and arrest warrant was issued\nagainst him by the Trial Court on 20-1-2009. Rustam Singh surrendered\nhimself on 19-6-2010. It is clear that on 12-9-2008, the Appellants\nmoved an application under <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 311</a> of Cr.P.C. for recall of Yuvraj\nSingh (P.W.1) for further cross-examination and the said application was\nrejected. Thereafter, Cr.R No.679 of 2009 was filed and this Court by\norder dated 7-1-2010 permitted the prayer for recall of Yuvraj Singh\n(P.W.1) for further cross-examination. Only thereafter, Rustam Singh\nsurrendered himself on 19-6-2010. It is submitted that in the light of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                     20</span>\n\norder passed in Cr.R. No. 679 of 2009, the Trial Court by its order dated\n22-1-2010, issued summons to Yuvraj Singh. The police was unable to\nserve Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) as he was missing.           On 9-4-2010, an\napplication was filed by the Complainant alleging that Yuvraj Singh\n(P.W.1) is in the captivity of the Appellants and the police is not serving\nsummons on him and is giving false report. Accordingly, the Trial Court\nby order dated 9-4-2010 directed that summons be served through I.G.\nGwalior. Thereafter, the summon issued to Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) was\nreturned back with an endorsement that he doesnot reside at the given\naddress. Thereafter, again on 12-5-2010, it was mentioned by the Trial\nCourt, that the summons issued against Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) has been\nreturned back with an endorsement that his house is in an abandoned and\ndilapidated condition and he doesnot reside there. Again on 24-5-2010, a\nstatement was made by S.H.O., Gola Ka Mandir, that the house of Yuvraj\nSingh (P.W.1) is in an abandoned and dilapidated condition and even\nwhereabouts of his family members are not known. Again on 7-6-2010,\narrest warrant was issued against Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1). On 15-6-2010,\nYuvraj Singh (P.W.1) appeared before the Trial Court and at the request\nof the Public Prosecutor, he was not examined. Thereafter, on 19-6-\n2010, the Appellant Rustam Singh surrendered. On 14-7-2010, Yuvraj\nSingh (P.W.1) appeared, but his evidence was not recorded. Ultimately,\nYuvraj Singh (P.W.1) was further cross-examined on 9-8-2010. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1120373\" id=\"span_25\">Thus, it is\nclear that not only the Appellant Rustam Singh had absconded and\nsurrendered just prior to the examination of Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) but\nduring this period, the police was unable to trace out Yuvraj Singh\n(P.W.1). Even the complainant party moved an application alleging that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                    21</span>\n\nYuvraj Singh (P.W.1) is in the captivity of the accused persons. Thus, the\nsomersault taken by Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) in his further cross-\nexamination, should be ignored. It is further submitted that not only the\nAppellant Mohar Singh had failed to prove his plea of alibi but no such\nplea was taken by him in his statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C. The\nCounsel for the State relied upon <a href=\"/doc/1120373/\" id=\"a_47\">Khujji Vs.

It is submitted\nthat multiple gun shot injuries were sustained by Yuvraj (P.W.1). Yuvraj\n(P.W.1) has suffered paraplegia. Nature of injuries is not the decisive\nfactor to make out an offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 307</a> of IPC. The nature of\ninjuries, nature of weapon, number of assaults, body part of the victim\nare some of the important aspects to find out the intention or knowledge\non the part of the assailant.

It is submitted by the Counsel for the complainant, that not only\nYuvraj Singh (P.W.1) is a reliable witness but even Hariom (P.W. 6) and\nUmesh Yadav (P.W.7) are also reliable witnesses, but the Trial Court has\nwrongly disbelieved them. The Trial Court has also wrongly disbelieved\nBhajju (P.W.4) who is the witness of conspiracy. All the accused persons\nwho were named in the FIR absconded immediately after the incident,\nwhich is indicative of their guilty mind.

Total 8 gun shot\ninjuries were found on the body of Sughar Singh. Injuries no. 1 and 7\nwere blast injuries. Injuries no.1 and 7 could have been caused by .12\nbore gun. Only one deformed bullet was found inside wound no.1. 30\npieces of deformed bullet were recovered from injury no. 7, but due to\nmistake, the description of entire pieces of bullet was not mentioned. If\ngun shot is fired from a very close range then blast injury can be caused.\nHe admitted that blast injury can be caused only when the substance and\ngasses enter inside the body directly and then blasts inside the body. He\nwas not in a position to say as to whether all the 8 injuries were caused\nby one firearm or by different firearms. Injuries no. 1 and 7 could have\nbeen caused by one firearm, whereas remaining injuries could have been\ncaused by different firearms. Bolt would enter inside the body only when\nthe gun shot is fired from a very close range or from a range of 4-5 ft.s.\nExcept on injury no. 1 and 7, no burning, tattooing was found around any\nother injury. He clarified that the meaning of gutter wound is that entry\nand exit wound are parallel to each other. If a person is sitting in the car\nand gut shots are fired from three sides, and if the injured remains seated\nin the same posture, then gutter injuries can be caused. However,if the\ninjured changes his position, then the injuries can be caused by gun shots\nfired from one direction.    Injury no.8 could have been caused from\nbehind, but thereafter clarified that it can be caused by gun shot fired\nfrom right side.

The law on the point can be summarised to the effect\n        that the testimony of the injured witness is accorded a\n        special status in law. This is as a consequence of the fact\n        that the injury to the witness is an inbuilt guarantee of\n        his presence at the scene of the crime and because the\n        witness will not want to let his actual assailant go\n        unpunished merely to falsely implicate a third party for\n        the commission of the offence. Thus, the deposition of\n        the injured witness should be relied upon unless there are\n        strong grounds for rejection of his evidence on the basis\n        of major contradictions and discrepancies therein.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"83761731\" id=\"span_55\">37.    The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/83761731/\" id=\"a_73\">State of Rajasthan v. Major\nSingh</a>, reported in (1999) 9 SCC 106 has held as under :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">      4........The High Court has further taken into consideration that\n      the prosecution witnesses have not stated exactly whether the\n      accused inflicted injuries by the sharp or blunt side of the\n      weapon and, therefore, they have not explained how the\n      deceased as well as the injured witness got incised injuries as\n      well as contusions. In our view, in holding that the prosecution\n      witnesses have not exactly stated whether the accused inflicted\n      injury by the sharp or blunt side of the weapon, the High Court\n      has ignored the reality of such occurrence. It would be\n      practically impossible for any injured witness to exactly notice\n      and memorise which accused was assaulting by the blunt side\n      of the weapon and which accused was causing injuries by a\n      sharp-edged weapon. Even if such statement is made, it may\n      amount to an exaggeration because when a number of\n      assailants are there, injuries are not inflicted in a manner which\n      could be exactly noted by the witness. If one or two injuries\n      are caused and if it is broad daylight, it is quite possible that\n      some witnesses may be in a position to note it. But at about\n      8.30 p.m., when the witness herself was receiving injuries, it\n      would not be possible to note and narrate whether the accused\n      were causing injuries to her parents by the blunt or sharp side\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                      35</span>\n\n      of the weapon. The other reason which is given by the High\n      Court is that injured witness Jeet Kaur has not stated a single\n      specific injury on a person which could be attributed to Ukar\n      Singh or Kulwant Singh except by vaguely stating that they\n      assaulted her parents and had also given gandasa blows to her\n      and, therefore, it creates a good deal of suspicion regarding\n      participation of Ukar Singh and Kulwant Singh in the incident.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">      Here also the High Court ignored the fact that once the\n      presence of Ukar Singh or Kulwant Singh is established at the\n      scene of offence and their participation is alleged, there was no\n      reason to doubt the evidence of the witness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"181466178\" id=\"span_57\">38.

Each of the reasoning assigned by the High Court, in our\n      opinion, is contrary to the well-settled legal principle. The\n      witnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution, apart from\n      being eyewitnesses, were injured witnesses. Their presence at\n      the place of occurrence, therefore, cannot be doubted. Only\n      because they were inimical to the respondents, the same by\n      itself cannot be a ground to discard their evidence. Although in\n      accepting the same, some amount of caution is required to be\n      maintained.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">      30. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"140991444\" id=\"span_58\">In <a href=\"/doc/140991444/\" id=\"a_75\">Ramashish Rai v.

We are clearly of the view that the findings of the\n         High Court were erroneous, resulting in grave\n         miscarriage of justice. The eyewitnesses -- PWs 1, 2, 3,\n         5, 8 and 10 consistently supported the case of the\n         prosecution throughout. They were subjected to lengthy\n         cross-examination but nothing could be elicited from\n         their mouth so as to discard the creditworthiness of their\n         statements. The ocular evidence of the eyewitnesses was\n         corroborated in material particulars by the medical\n         evidence. In our view, therefore, the acquittal recorded by\n         the High Court on the aforesaid reasoning is perverse.</span>\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                               36</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_71\">   The High Court discarded the eyewitness account,\n   branded them as inimical witnesses. This is not the\n   requirement of law. The requirement of law is that the\n   testimony of inimical witnesses has to be considered with\n   caution. If otherwise the witnesses are true and reliable\n   their testimony cannot be thrown out on the threshold by\n   branding them as inimical witnesses. By now, it is well-\n   settled principle of law that enmity is a double-edged\n   sword. It can be a ground for false implication. It also can\n   be a ground for assault. Therefore, a duty is cast upon the\n   court to examine the testimony of inimical witnesses with\n   due caution and diligence. In the present case the High\n   Court has rejected the otherwise creditworthy testimony\n   of eyewitness account merely on the ground that there\n   was enmity between the prosecution party and the\n   accused party.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">31. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"333507\" id=\"span_60\">In <a href=\"/doc/333507/\" id=\"a_76\">State of U.P. v.

The submission of the counsel for the accused that\n   the testimony of PWs cannot be acted upon as they are\n   interested witnesses is to be noted only to be rejected. By\n   now, it is well-settled principle of law that animosity is a\n   double-edged sword. It cuts both sides. It could be a\n   ground for false implication and it could also be a ground\n   for assault. Just because the witnesses are related to the\n   deceased would be no ground to discard their testimony,\n   if otherwise their testimony inspires confidence. In the\n   given facts of the present case, they are but natural\n   witnesses. We have no reason to disbelieve their\n   testimony. Similarly, being relatives, it would be their\n   endeavour to see that the real culprits are punished and\n   normally they would not implicate wrong persons in the\n   crime, so as to allow the real culprits to escape\n   unpunished.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">32. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"126970298\" id=\"span_61\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"126970298\" id=\"span_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"122583226\" id=\"span_63\">In <a href=\"/doc/122583226/\" id=\"a_77\">Baitullah v.

State of Rajasthan</a> wherein it was\nobserved: (<a href=\"/doc/126970298/\" id=\"a_79\">Arjun</a> case, SCC p. 192, para 9)\n   &quot;9. Learned counsel for the appellants first contended\n   that there was long-standing enmity between the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                               37</span>\n\n  complainant and some of the witnesses on one hand and\n  the appellants on the other and some criminal\n  proceedings between them were going on when the\n  alleged incident took place and hence it was due to this\n  enmity that the appellants were falsely implicated. It was\n  also submitted that Bahori, PW 1 and Sat Pal Singh, PW\n  7 are also relatives of the deceased and other prosecution\n  witnesses are also close associates and, therefore, there is\n  possibility of false implication of the appellants in the\n  crime in question. It is an admitted fact that the\n  complainant and the appellants were on inimical terms\n  and some criminal proceedings were pending between\n  them even at the time when the occurrence took place. It\n  is equally true that Bahori, PW 1 is the brother of the\n  deceased and informant Sat Pal Singh, PW 7 is the son of\n  the deceased. But we are not convinced by the aforesaid\n  arguments that either on account of animosity or on\n  account of relationship they did not divulge the truth but\n  fabricated a false case against the appellants. It is\n  needless to emphasise that enmity is a double-edged\n  sword which can cut both ways. However, the fact\n  remains that whether the prosecution witnesses are close\n  relatives of the deceased victim or are on inimical terms\n  with the deceased involved in the crime of murder, the\n  witnesses are always interested to see that the real\n  offenders of the crime are booked and they are not, in any\n  case, expected to leave out the real culprits and rope in\n  the innocent persons simply because of the enmity. It is,\n  therefore, not a safe rule to reject their testimony merely\n  on the ground that the complainant and the accused\n  persons were on inimical terms. Similarly the evidence\n  could not be rejected merely on the basis of relationship\n  of the witnesses with the deceased. In such a situation it\n  only puts the Court with the solemn duty to make a\n  deeper probe and scrutinise the evidence with more than\n  ordinary care which precaution has already been taken by\n  the two courts below while analysing and accepting the\n  evidence.&quot;</span></span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">33.

As regards the second ground for rejecting the evidence of\n      these eyewitnesses given by the High Court, namely, that they\n      have falsely implicated Laxman Shirsat @ Paparkar, this too, in\n      our opinion was hardly a good ground for rejecting their\n      evidence. It is well known that in India the doctrine of falsus in\n      uno falsus in omnibus (false in one false in all) does not apply.\n      The court can partly reject and partly accept the evidence of a\n      witness, and it is not correct to say that merely because some\n      part of the evidence is found to be false the entire evidence has\n      to be rejected. (See <a href=\"/doc/439549/\" id=\"a_80\">Krishna Mochi v. State of Bihar</a>.) If the\n      court finds that out of several co-accused, one or more are\n      falsely implicated, that does not necessarily mean that everyone\n      was falsely implicated. Similarly, the third ground for rejecting\n      the testimony of the four eyewitnesses, namely, that they have\n      falsely stated that Suresh Sobaji had witnessed the incident, is\n      in our opinion not a good ground for rejecting the prosecution\n      version in toto.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">      35. Thus, in our opinion, the High Court has rejected the\n      evidence of the four eyewitnesses, three of whom were injured,\n      on flimsy grounds.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">39.    Thus, from the judgment cited by the Counsel for the Appellants\nhimself, it is clear that much weight is to be given to the evidence of\ninjured witness and mere enmity cannot be a ground to discard his\nevidence, although it may require cautious appreciation of evidence of\ninjured witness. Further the doctrine of Falsus in uno Falsus in omnibus\nhas no application in India and enmity is a double-edged weapon and the\nCourt can partially reject the evidence and can partially rely the same\nwitness. Further, the evidence of a related witness cannot be rejected on\nthe ground of relationship, but on the contrary why a witness would\nspare the real culprit?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">40.    Yuvraj (P.W.1) was brought in the Court on a stretcher as he was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                     39</span>\n\ncompletely unable to walk or move, but a note was appended by the Trial\nCourt, that the witness is fit to speak and understand.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_80\">41.

Kaptan was having .12\nbore gun whereas Autar was having .315 bore gun. As soon as the\nvehicle reached near Maharajpura Factory road, the driver of Safari car\nblew horn for side.

He denied that he is on inimical terms with Rustam Singh.\nSughar Singh had not sustained any injury in the incident which took\nplace on 17-10-2005.

From the order-sheet dated 16-8-2007,\nit is clear that on 16-8-2007 also, this witness was brought on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                    44</span>\n\nstretcher.

He\nadmitted that after sustaining gun shot injuries he was not in a position to\nwalk. At the time of incident, the vehicle of Hariom was not there. Since\nhe was bleeding therefore, the cloths of the persons who had shifted him\nto hospital, must also have got stained with blood. After the firing, he\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                    46</span>\n\nremained on the spot hardly for 2-3 minutes as Mukesh and Umesh had\nimmediately come.

Another application under <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 311</a> of Cr.P.C. was filed for\nrecall of Yuvraj (P.W.1) which was rejected by order dated 26-8-2009.\nCr.R. No. 679 of 2009 was filed before the High Court. By order dated\n7-1-2010, the Criminal Revision was allowed and Yuvraj (P.W.1) was\nrecalled. Accordingly, Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) was recalled and was further\ncross-examined on 7-1-2010 and in further cross-examination, Yuvraj\n(P.W.1) took a complete somersault and claimed that since, he was under\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">captivity of Hariom, therefore, his previous evidence was given under\npressure. He also stated that he had also filed a private complaint on 14-\n8-2007 against Hariom, Ex. D.31 alleging that he was forced to depose\nagainst the accused persons and denied the presence of the accused\npersons on the spot.     This witness was re-examined by the public\nprosecutor. In re-examination, he clarified that the complaint was filed\nby his Counsel. He expressed his ignorance about the stage of complaint\nand also expressed that he doesnot know that complaint has been\ndismissed. He admitted that he never disclosed to anybody that he had\ngiven his evidence under pressure. He admitted that he was given police\nprotection but he did not disclose to police that he is under the pressure\nof Hariom. He also admitted that he had gone to Delhi for treatment and\nHariom was not with him. He admitted that his cross-examination was\ndeferred on two occasions, but he did not disclose to any body that he is\ndeposing under the pressure of Hariom. He denied that after his evidence\nwas over, he was pressurized by the accused persons. He admitted that\nthe accused are the residents of same village and are influential persons.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">45.   Thus, it is clear that after this witness was recalled, he took a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                     48</span>\n\nsomersault and tried to disown his previous evidence by alleging that it\nwas given under the pressure of Hariom.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_87\">46.    Now the next question for consideration is that whether the\nsubsequent evidence which was recorded after his recall can be relied\nupon or not?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">47.    The cross-examination of Yuvraj (P.W.1) had concluded on 5-9-\n2007 and application for his recall was filed on 21-8-2009 i.e., after 2\nyears of conclusion of his cross-examination. Thereafter, he was recalled\nand further cross-examined on 9-8-2010, i.e., after 3 years of conclusion\nof his cross-examination. Thus, the question for consideration before\nthis Court is that what would be the effect of such somersault taken by\nYuvraj (P.W.1)?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1120373\" id=\"span_77\">48.    The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1120373/\" id=\"a_87\">Khujji @ Surendra Tiwari Vs.\nState of M.P.</a> reported in AIR 1991 SC 1853 has held as under :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">      7......His cross-examination commenced on 15th December,\n      1978. In his cross-examination he stated that the appellant\n      Khujji and Gudda had their backs towards him and hence he\n      could not see their faces while he could identify the remaining\n      four persons. He stated that he had inferred that the other two\n      persons were the appellant and Gudda. On the basis of this\n      statement Mr. Lalit submitted that the evidence regarding the\n      identity of the appellant is rendered highly doubtful and it\n      would be hazardous to convict the appellant solely on the basis\n      of identification by such a wavering witness. The High Court\n      came to the conclusion and, in our opinion rightly, that during\n      the one month period that elapsed since the recording of his\n      examination-in-chief something transpired which made him\n      shift his evidence on the question of identity to help the\n      appellant. We are satisfied on a reading of his entire evidence\n      that his statement in cross-examination on the question of\n      identity of the appellant and his companion is a clear attempt to\n      wriggle out of what he had stated earlier in his examination~in-\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                      49</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">      chief. Since the incident occurred at a public place, it is\n      reasonable to infer that the street lights illuminated the place\n      sufficiently to enable this witness to identify the assailants. We\n      have, therefore, no hesitation in concluding that he had ample\n      opportunity to identify the assailants of Gulab, his presence at\n      the scene of occurrence is not unnatural nor is his statement\n      that he had come to purchase vegetables unacceptable. We do\n      not find any material contradictions in his evidence to doubt\n      his testimony. He is a totally independent witness who had no\n      cause to give false evidence against the appellant and his\n      companions. We are, therefore, not impressed by the reasons\n      which weighed with the trial Court for rejecting his evidence.\n      We agree with the High Court that his evidence is acceptable\n      regarding the time, place and manner of the incident as well as\n      the identity of the assailants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1424480\" id=\"span_79\">49.

State of Bihar, JT 2002\n      (4) SC 62). Though the legal position is quite clear still we\n      have gone through the evidence on record in order to examine\n      whether the findings recorded against the appellants suffer\n      from any infirmity. The testimony of PW-1 Ganesh Singh, who\n      is an injured witness, and PW-4 Ramji Singh clearly\n      establishes the guilt of the accused. According to the case of\n      the prosecution the incident took place shortly after sunset. The\n      eye-witnesses have deposed that after the incident the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                               50</span>\n\ndeceased-Hira Singh was carried on a cot to the &#x27;bandh&#x27;, which\nis on the outskirts of the village. As no conveyance was\navailable, the first informant had to wait for quite some time\nand thereafter a tempo was arranged on which the deceased\nwas taken to the district hospital where he was medically\nexamined by PW-2 Dr. Siddiqui at 9.00 P.M. It has come in\nevidence that the village is at a distance of six miles from\npolice station Kotwali, Ballia. The non- availability of any\nconveyance is quite natural as it was Holi festival. Even PW-3\nMohan Yadav fully supported the prosecution case in his\nexamination-in-chief. In his cross-examination, which was\nrecorded on the same date, he gave details of the weapons\nbeing carried by each of the accused and also the specific role\nplayed by them in assaulting the deceased and other injured\npersons. As his cross-examination could not be completed it\nwas resumed on the next day and then he gave a statement that\nhe could not see the incident on account of darkness.

The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/188951670/\" id=\"a_95\">Vinod Kumar Vs. State of\nPunjab</a> reported in (2015) 3 SCC 220 has held as under :</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">      51. It is necessary, though painful, to note that PW 7 was\n      examined-in-chief on 30-9-1999 and was cross-examined on\n      25-5-2001, almost after 1 year and 8 months. The delay in said\n      cross-examination, as we have stated earlier had given enough\n      time for prevarication due to many a reason. A fair trial is to be\n      fair both to the defence and the prosecution as well as to the\n      victim. An offence registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_96\">Prevention of\n      Corruption Act</a> is to be tried with all seriousness. We fail to\n      appreciate how the learned trial Judge could exhibit such laxity\n      in granting so much time for cross-examination in a case of\n      this nature. It would have been absolutely appropriate on the\n      part of the learned trial Judge to finish the cross-examination\n      on the day the said witness was examined. As is evident, for no\n      reason whatsoever it was deferred and the cross-examination\n      took place after 20 months. The witness had all the time in the\n      world to be gained over. We have already opined that he was\n      declared hostile and re-examined.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_95\">      52. It is settled in law that the testimony of a hostile witness\n      can be relied upon by the prosecution as well as the defence. In\n      re-examination by the Public Prosecutor, PW 7 has accepted\n      about the correctness of his statement in the court on 13-9-\n      1999. He has also accepted that he had not made any complaint\n      to the Presiding Officer of the court in writing or verbally that\n      the Inspector was threatening him to make a false statement in\n      the court. It has also been accepted by him that he had given\n      the statement in the court on account of fear of false\n      implication by the Inspector. He has agreed to have signed his\n      statement dated 13-9-1999 after going through and admitting it\n      to be correct. It has come in the re-examination that PW 7 had\n      not stated in his statement dated 13-9-1999 in the court that\n      recovery of tainted money was not effected in his presence\n      from the accused or that he had been told by the Inspector that\n      amount has been recovered from the accused. He had also not\n      stated in his said statement that the accused and witnesses were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">                                52</span>\n\ntaken to the Tehsil and it was there that he had signed all the\nmemos.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_96\">Reading the evidence in entirety, PW 7&#x27;s evidence cannot be\nbrushed aside. The delay in cross-examination has resulted in\nhis prevarication from the examination-in-chief. But, a\nsignificant one, his examination-in-chief and the re-\nexamination impels us to accept the testimony that he had gone\ninto the octroi post and had witnessed about the demand and\nacceptance of money by the accused. In his cross-examination\nhe has stated that he had not gone with Baj Singh to the\nVigilance Department at any time and no recovery was made in\nhis presence. The said part of the testimony, in our considered\nview, does not commend acceptance in the backdrop of entire\nevidence in examination-in-chief and the re-examination.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_97\">                   *      *      *     *\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">57. Before parting with the case we are constrained to reiterate\nwhat we have said in the beginning. We have expressed our\nagony and anguish for the manner in which trials in respect of\nserious offences relating to corruption are being conducted by\nthe trial courts:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">57.1. Adjournments are sought on the drop of a hat by the\ncounsel, even though the witness is present in court, contrary\nto all principles of holding a trial. That apart, after the\nexamination-in-chief of a witness is over, adjournment is\nsought for cross-examination and the disquieting feature is that\nthe trial courts grant time. The law requires special reasons to\nbe recorded for grant of time but the same is not taken note of.\n57.2. As has been noticed earlier, in the instant case the cross-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">examination has taken place after a year and 8 months allowing\nample time to pressurise the witness and to gain over him by\nadopting all kinds of tactics.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_100\">57.3. There is no cavil over the proposition that there has to be\na fair and proper trial but the duty of the court while\nconducting the trial is to be guided by the mandate of the law,\nthe conceptual fairness and above all bearing in mind its\nsacrosanct duty to arrive at the truth on the basis of the material\nbrought on record. If an accused for his benefit takes the trial\non the path of total mockery, it cannot be countenanced. The\ncourt has a sacred duty to see that the trial is conducted as per\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                      53</span>\n\n      law. If adjournments are granted in this manner it would\n      tantamount to violation of the rule of law and eventually turn\n      such trials to a farce. It is legally impermissible and\n      jurisprudentially abominable. The trial courts are expected in\n      law to follow the command of the procedure relating to trial\n      and not yield to the request of the counsel to grant adjournment\n      for non-acceptable reasons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_101\">      57.4. In fact, it is not at all appreciable to call a witness for\n      cross-examination after such a long span of time. It is\n      imperative if the examination-in-chief is over, the cross-\n      examination should be completed on the same day. If the\n      examination of a witness continues till late hours the trial can\n      be adjourned to the next day for cross-examination. It is\n      inconceivable in law that the cross-examination should be\n      deferred for such a long time. It is anathema to the concept of\n      proper and fair trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_102\">      57.5. The duty of the court is to see that not only the interest of\n      the accused as per law is protected but also the societal and\n      collective interest is safeguarded. It is distressing to note that\n      despite series of judgments of this Court, the habit of granting\n      adjournment, really an ailment, continues. How long shall we\n      say, &quot;Awake! Arise!&quot;. There is a constant discomfort.\n      Therefore, we think it appropriate that the copies of the\n      judgment be sent to the learned Chief Justices of all the High\n      Courts for circulating the same among the learned trial Judges\n      with a command to follow the principles relating to trial in a\n      requisite manner and not to defer the cross-examination of a\n      witness at their pleasure or at the leisure of the defence\n      counsel, for it eventually makes the trial an apology for trial\n      and compels the whole society to suffer chicanery. Let it be\n      remembered that law cannot allowed to be lonely; a destitute.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"23889691\" id=\"span_90\">51.

There appears to be a misconception regarding the effect on\n    the testimony of a witness declared hostile. It is a misconceived\n    notion that merely because a witness is declared hostile his\n    entire evidence should be excluded or rendered unworthy of\n    consideration. This Court in <a href=\"/doc/1594619/\" id=\"a_106\">Bhagwan Singh v. State of\n    Haryana</a> held that merely because the Court gave permission\n    to the Public Prosecutor to cross-examine his own witness\n    describing him as hostile witness does not completely efface\n    his evidence. The evidence remains admissible in the trial and\n    there is no legal bar to base the conviction upon the testimony\n    of such witness.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"194959\" id=\"span_101\">In <a href=\"/doc/194959/\" id=\"a_107\">Rabindra Kumar Dey v.

Merely on this ground his whole testimony cannot be\n    excluded from consideration. In a criminal trial where a\n    prosecution witness is cross-examined and contradicted with\n    the leave of the court by the party calling him for evidence\n    cannot, as a matter of general rule, be treated as washed off the\n    record altogether. It is for the court of fact to consider in each\n    case whether as a result of such cross-examination and\n    contradiction the witness stands discredited or can still be\n    believed in regard to any part of his testimony. In appropriate\n    cases the court can rely upon the part of testimony of such\n    witness if that part of the deposition is found to be\n    creditworthy.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">    12. The terms &quot;hostile&quot;, &quot;adverse&quot; or &quot;unfavourable&quot; witnesses\n    are alien to the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_108\">Indian Evidence Act</a>. The terms &quot;hostile\n    witness&quot;, &quot;adverse witness&quot;, &quot;unfavourable witness&quot;,\n    &quot;unwilling witness&quot; are all terms of English law. The rule of\n    not permitting a party calling the witness to cross-examine are\n    relaxed under the common law by evolving the terms &quot;hostile\n    witness and unfavourable witness&quot;. Under the common law a\n    hostile witness is described as one who is not desirous of\n    telling the truth at the instance of the party calling him and an\n    unfavourable witness is one called by a party to prove a\n    particular fact in issue or relevant to the issue who fails to\n    prove such fact, or proves the opposite test. In India the right to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">                               56</span>\n\ncross-examine the witnesses by the party calling him is\ngoverned by the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_109\">Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a>.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">Section 142 requires that leading question cannot be put to the\nwitness in examination-in-chief or in re-examination except\nwith the permission of the court. The court can, however,\npermit leading question as to the matters which are\nintroductory or undisputed or which have, in its opinion,\nalready been sufficiently proved. Section 154 authorises the\ncourt in its discretion to permit the person who calls a witness\nto put any question to him which might be put in cross-\nexamination by the adverse party. The courts are, therefore,\nunder a legal obligation to exercise the discretion vesting in\nthem in a judicious manner by proper application of mind and\nkeeping in view the attending circumstances. Permission for\ncross-examination in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1646837/\" id=\"a_110\">Section 154</a> of the Evidence Act\ncannot and should not be granted at the mere asking of the\nparty calling the witness.

Whether\n   it be the grant of permission under Section 142 to put\n   leading questions, or the leave under Section 154 to ask\n   questions which might be put in cross-examination by the\n   adverse party, the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_113\">Indian Evidence Act</a> leaves the matter\n   entirely to the discretion of the court (see the\n   observations of Sir Lawrence Jenkins in Baikuntha Nath\n   Chattorji v.

The discretion\n   conferred by Section 154 on the court is unqualified and\n   untrammelled, and is apart from any question of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                             57</span>\n\n&#x27;hostility&#x27;.

The grant\nof such permission does not amount to an adjudication by\nthe court as to the veracity of the witness. Therefore, in\nthe order granting such permission, it is preferable to\navoid the use of such expressions, such as &#x27;declared\nhostile&#x27;, &#x27;declared unfavourable&#x27;, the significance of\nwhich is still not free from the historical cobwebs which,\nin their wake bring a misleading legacy of confusion, and\nconflict that had so long vexed the English courts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">39. It is important to note that the English statute differs\nmaterially from the law contained in the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_114\">Indian Evidence\nAct</a> in regard to cross-examination and contradiction of\nhis own witness by a party. Under the English law, a\nparty is not permitted to impeach the credit of his own\nwitness by general evidence of his bad character, shady\nantecedents or previous conviction. In India, this can be\ndone with the consent of the court under <a href=\"/doc/69347904/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 155</a>.\n<a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_116\">Under the English Act</a> of 1865, a party calling the\nwitness can &#x27;cross-examine&#x27; and contradict a witness in\nrespect of his previous inconsistent statements with the\nleave of the court, only when the court considers the\nwitness to be &#x27;adverse&#x27;. As already noticed, no such\ncondition has been laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1646837/\" id=\"a_117\">Sections 154</a> or 155 of\nthe Indian Act and the grant of such leave has been left\ncompletely to the discretion of the court, the exercise of\nwhich is not fettered by or dependent upon the &#x27;hostility&#x27;\nor &#x27;adverseness&#x27; of the witness. In this respect, the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_118\">Indian\nEvidence Act</a> is in advance of the English law. The\nCriminal Law Revision Committee of England in its\nEleventh Report, made recently, has recommended the\nadoption of a modernised version of Section 3 of the\nCriminal Procedure Act, 1865, allowing contradiction of\nboth unfavourable and hostile witnesses by other\nevidence without leave of the court. The Report is,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                    58</span>\n\n         however, still in favour of retention of the prohibition on\n         a party&#x27;s impeaching his own witness by evidence of bad\n         character.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">      40.

From the above conspectus, it emerges clear that even\n         in a criminal prosecution when a witness is cross-\n         examined and contradicted with the leave of the court, by\n         the party calling him, his evidence cannot, as a matter of\n         law, be treated as washed off the record altogether. It is\n         for the Judge of fact to consider in each case whether as a\n         result of such cross-examination and contradiction, the\n         witness stand thoroughly discredited or can still be\n         believed in regard to a part of his testimony. If the Judge\n         finds that in the process, the credit of the witness has not\n         been completely shaken, he may, after reading and\n         considering the evidence of the witness, as a whole, with\n         due caution and care, accept, in the light of the other\n         evidence on the record, that part of his testimony which\n         he finds to be creditworthy and act upon it. If in a given\n         case, the whole of the testimony of the witness is\n         impugned, and in the process, the witness stands squarely\n         and totally discredited, the Judge should, as a matter of\n         prudence, discard his evidence in toto.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_112\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"166873249\" id=\"span_105\">53.    The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/166873249/\" id=\"a_120\">Bhajju v. State of M.P.</a>,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                    59</span>\n\nreported in (2012) 4 SCC 327 has held as under :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">    35. Now, we shall discuss the effect of hostile witnesses as well\n    as the worth of the defence put forward on behalf of the\n    appellant-accused. Normally, when a witness deposes contrary\n    to the stand of the prosecution and his own statement recorded\n    under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 161</a> CrPC, the prosecutor, with the permission of\n    the court, can pray to the court for declaring that witness hostile\n    and for granting leave to cross-examine the said witness. If\n    such a permission is granted by the court then the witness is\n    subjected to cross-examination by the prosecutor as well as an\n    opportunity is provided to the defence to cross-examine such\n    witnesses, if he so desires. In other words, there is a limited\n    examination-in-chief, cross-examination by the prosecutor and\n    cross-examination by the counsel for the accused. It is\n    admissible to use the examination-in-chief as well as the cross-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_113\">    examination of the said witness insofar as it supports the case\n    of the prosecution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_114\">    36. It is settled law that the evidence of hostile witnesses can\n    also be relied upon by the prosecution to the extent to which it\n    supports the prosecution version of the incident. The evidence\n    of such witnesses cannot be treated as washed off the records, it\n    remains admissible in trial and there is no legal bar to base the\n    conviction of the accused upon such testimony, if corroborated\n    by other reliable evidence. <a href=\"/doc/1646837/\" id=\"a_122\">Section 154</a> of the Evidence Act\n    enables the court, in its discretion, to permit the person, who\n    calls a witness, to put any question to him which might be put\n    in cross-examination by the adverse party.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_115\">    37. The view that the evidence of the witness who has been\n    called and cross-examined by the party with the leave of the\n    court, cannot be believed or disbelieved in part and has to be\n    excluded altogether, is not the correct exposition of law. The\n    courts may rely upon so much of the testimony which supports\n    the case of the prosecution and is corroborated by other\n    evidence. It is also now a settled canon of criminal\n    jurisprudence that the part which has been allowed to be cross-\n    examined can also be relied upon by the prosecution. These\n    principles have been encompassed in the judgments of this\n    Court in the following cases:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                     60</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"119601\" id=\"span_108\">(<a href=\"/doc/119601/\" id=\"a_123\">a) Koli Lakhmanbhai Chanabhai v.

Thus, it is well established principle of law that merely because a\nwitness has turned hostile, would not efface his entire evidence and the\nCourt can rely on that part of the evidence of such hostile witness, which\ncorroborates the prosecution or defence story.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">55.    We shall consider the facts which may indicate that the witness\nwas subsequently won over by the accused party.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_118\">56.   From the order-sheets of the Trial Court, it is clear that the main\naccused Rustam Singh was not appearing before the Trial Court from 22-\n11-2008 and ultimately his bail bonds were cancelled and arrest warrant\nwas issued against him by the Trial Court on 20-1-2009. Rustam Singh\nsurrendered himself on 19-6-2010. It is clear that on 21-8-2009, the\nAppellants moved an application under <a href=\"/doc/1780550/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 311</a> of Cr.P.C. for recall\nof Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) for further cross-examination and the said\napplication was rejected. Thereafter, Cr.R No.679 of 2009 was filed and\nthis Court by order dated 7-1-2010 permitted the prayer for recall of\nYuvraj Singh (P.W.1) for further cross-examination. Only thereafter,\nRustam Singh surrendered himself on 19-6-2010. It is submitted that in\nthe light of the order passed in Cr.R. No. 679 of 2009, the Trial Court by\nits order dated 22-1-2010, issued summons against Yuvraj Singh. The\npolice was unable to serve Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) as he was missing. On\n9-4-2010, an application was filed by the Complainant alleging that\nYuvraj Singh (P.W.1) is in the captivity of the Appellants and the police is\nnot serving summons on him and is giving false report. Accordingly, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                    61</span>\n\nTrial Court by order dated 9-4-2010 directed that summons be served\nthrough I.G. Gwalior. Thereafter, the summon issued to Yuvraj Singh\n(P.W.1) was returned back with an endorsement that he doesnot reside at\nthe given address. Thereafter, again on 12-5-2010, it was mentioned by\nthe Trial Court, that the summons issued against Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) has\nbeen returned back with an endorsement that his house is in an\nabandoned and dilapidated condition and he doesnot reside there. Again\non 24-5-2010, a statement was made by S.H.O., Gola Ka Mandir, that the\nhouse of Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) is in an abandoned and dilapidated\ncondition and even whereabouts of his family members are not known.\nAgain on 7-6-2010, arrest was issued against Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1). On\n15-6-2010, Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) appeared before the Trial Court and at\nthe request of the Public Prosecutor, he was not examined. Thereafter, on\n19-6-2010, the Appellant Rustam Singh surrendered. On 14-7-2010,\nYuvraj Singh (P.W.1) appeared, but his evidence was not recorded.\nUltimately, Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) was further cross-examined on 9-8-\n2010. Thus, it is clear that not only the Appellant Rustam Singh had\nabsconded and surrendered just prior to the examination of Yuvraj Singh\n(P.W.1) but during this period, the police was unable to trace out Yuvraj\nSingh (P.W.1).    Even the complainant party moved an application\nalleging that Yuvraj Singh (P.W.1) is in the captivity of the accused\npersons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_119\">57.   Further, Yuvraj (P.W.1) has admitted in his re-examination by the\nPublic Prosecutor, that after the incident, he was given the police\nprotection of 1.4 guard and he did not disclose to them that he was under\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"158640398\" id=\"span_112\">pressure of Hariom. Thereafter, he also admitted that he was taken to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                     62</span>\n\nDelhi for treatment and Hariom was not there. He also admitted that his\nexamination in chief and cross-examination was recorded on different\ndates but he never complained to the Court, that he was under pressure of\nHariom. Only after 2 years of his examination and cross-examination and\nthat too when the statements of the accused were already recorded under\n<a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_127\">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C., the co-accused Sitaram filed an application for\nfurther cross-examination of this witness on the ground that in the Trial\nof co-accused Dinesh Yadav, Yuvraj (P.W.1) has turned hostile, therefore,\nit is necessary to recall him. However, it is clear that in the light of\njudgment passed by the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/158640398/\" id=\"a_128\">A.T. Mydeen</a>\n(Supra), the evidence led in the case of co-accused cannot be read\nagainst or in favor of other accused. Yuvraj (P.W.1) was further cross-</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_120\">examined after three years of his examination-in-chief and cross-\nexamination. Thus, there is sufficient material available on record which\nsuggests that lot of things took place after recording of his initial cross-\nexamination which led to a situation where this witness Yuvraj (P.W.1)\ntook a somersault and turned hostile.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_121\">58.   It is submitted by the Counsel for the Appellants that the evidence\nof such a witness who is ready to change his version from time to time is\nnot worth acceptance and therefore, the evidence of such a shaky witness\nshould be discarded.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_122\">59.   Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the\nAppellants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_123\">60.   The latin maxim Falsus in uno falsus in omnibus has no\napplication in India. The Courts must make every effort to find out the\ntruth by removing grain from the chaff. If the earlier examination-in-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                      63</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_124\">chief and cross-examination is considered in the light of the statement\nmade by this witness to Doctor, Ex. D.4, then it is clear that in his\nstatement, Ex. D.4, this witness had specifically stated that Rustam Singh\nfired gun shot and 8-10 more persons had fired. Thus, the immediate\nversion of this witness was that firing was done by Appellant Rustam\nSingh and his 8-10 companions. Further it is clear from seizure of Safari\nCar, Ex. P.17, 16 gun shot marks were found on front and right side of the\ncar. The glasses of the Safari car were broken due to gun shots. One .\n315 bore rifle was also found on the middle row of the Safari Car which\nalso had a gun shot mark on its magzine and other parts. Further more,\nthis witness had suffered multiple gun shot injuries and he was\nimmediately shifted to hospital, where he was operated upon.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_125\">61.   Thus, there is sufficient material available on record to suggest that\nthe examination-in-chief and cross-examination of Yuvraj (P.W.1) which\ncompleted on 5-9-2007 was the truthful version and subsequent\nsomersault taken by Yuvraj (P.W.1) on his further cross-examination,\nunder the orders of High Court can be ignored as something must have\ntranspired to compel this witness to take a different stand.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">62.   So far as the shaky nature of this witness is concerned, the said\nsubmission made by Shri K.T.S. Tulsi, Senior Advocate, cannot be\naccepted. The accused persons after pressurizing the witnesses cannot\nbrand them as shaky witnesses. Further more, this Court has already\ncome to a conclusion that the examination-in-chief and earlier cross-\nexamination which was recorded upto 5-9-2007 is a truthful version,\ntherefore, this witness cannot be termed as shaky witness, only because\nof the fact that he turned hostile after his further cross-examination.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                      64</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_127\">63.    Further more, the application for recall of this witness was filed by\nco-accused Sitaram. How Sitaram came to know that Yuvraj (P.W.1) also\nwants to change his stand in respect of the accused persons who were\nfacing trial in the present case? It is well established principle of law that\nthe evidence recorded in the case of one accused cannot be read in favor\nof another accused who was tried separately. This also clearly show that\nthe Appellants were in touch with Yuvraj (P.W.1) and were aware of the\nfact that Yuvraj (P.W.1) would resile from his earlier version, in case if he\nis recalled.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1100291\" id=\"span_116\">64.

As stated earlier, all the witnesses to the extra-judicial\n      confession have been declared hostile by the prosecution. True\n      it is that the evidence of the hostile witness is not altogether\n      wiped out and remains admissible in evidence and there is no\n      legal bar to base conviction on the basis of the testimony of\n      hostile witness but as a rule of prudence, the court requires\n      corroboration by other reliable evidence......\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_129\">      Evidentiary value of extra-judicial confession depends upon\n      trustworthiness of the witness before whom confession is\n      made. Law does not contemplate that the evidence of an extra-\n      judicial confession should in all cases be corroborated. It is not\n      an inflexible rule that in no case conviction can be based solely\n      on extra-judicial confession. It is basically in the realm of\n      appreciation of evidence and a question of fact to be decided in\n      the facts and circumstances of each case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_130\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1100291\" id=\"span_117\">65.

We find that it is becoming a common phenomenon, almost\n      a regular feature, that in criminal cases witnesses turn hostile.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_132\">      There could be various reasons for this behaviour or attitude of\n      the witnesses. It is possible that when the statements of such\n      witnesses were recorded under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 161</a> of the Code of\n      Criminal Procedure, 1973 by the police during investigation,\n      the investigating officer forced them to make such statements\n      and, therefore, they resiled therefrom while deposing in the\n      court and justifiably so. However, this is no longer the reason\n      in most of the cases. This trend of witnesses turning hostile is\n      due to various other factors. It may be fear of deposing against\n      the accused/delinquent or political pressure or pressure of other\n      family members or other such sociological factors. It is also\n      possible that witnesses are corrupted with monetary\n      considerations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_133\">      40. In some of the judgments in past few years, this Court has\n      commented upon such peculiar behaviour of witnesses turning\n      hostile and we would like to quote from few such judgments.\n      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"439549\" id=\"span_123\">In <a href=\"/doc/439549/\" id=\"a_138\">Krishna Mochi v. State of Bihar</a>, this Court observed as\n      under: (SCC p. 104, para 31)\n         &quot;31. It is a matter of common experience that in recent\n         times there has been a sharp decline of ethical values in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">                              66</span>\n\n  public life even in developed countries much less\n  developing one, like ours, where the ratio of decline is\n  higher. Even in ordinary cases, witnesses are not inclined\n  to depose or their evidence is not found to be credible by\n  courts for manifold reasons. One of the reasons may be\n  that they do not have courage to depose against an\n  accused because of threats to their life, more so when the\n  offenders are habitual criminals or high-ups in the\n  Government or close to powers, which may be political,\n  economic or other powers including muscle power.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_134\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"105430\" id=\"span_125\">41. Likewise, in <a href=\"/doc/105430/\" id=\"a_139\">Zahira Habibullah Sheikh (5) v. State of\nGujarat</a>, this Court highlighted the problem with the following\nobservations: (SCC pp. 396-98, paras 40-41)\n  &quot;40. &quot;Witnesses&quot; as Bentham said: &quot;are the eyes and ears\n  of justice&quot;. Hence, the importance and primacy of the\n  quality of trial process. If the witness himself is\n  incapacitated from acting as eyes and ears of justice, the\n  trial gets putrefied and paralysed, and it no longer can\n  constitute a fair trial. The incapacitation may be due to\n  several factors, like the witness being not in a position\n  for reasons beyond control to speak the truth in the court\n  or due to negligence or ignorance or some corrupt\n  collusion. Time has become ripe to act on account of\n  numerous experiences faced by the court on account of\n  frequent turning of witnesses as hostile, either due to\n  threats, coercion, lures and monetary considerations at\n  the instance of those in power, their henchmen and\n  hirelings, political clouts and patronage and innumerable\n  other corrupt practices ingeniously adopted to smother\n  and stifle truth and realities coming out to surface....\n  Broader public and societal interests require that the\n  victims of the crime who are not ordinarily parties to\n  prosecution and the interests of the State represented by\n  their prosecuting agencies do not suffer.... There comes\n  the need for protecting the witness. Time has come when\n  serious and undiluted thoughts are to be bestowed for\n  protecting witnesses so that the ultimate truth presented\n  before the court and justice triumphs and that the trial is\n  not reduced to a mockery. ...</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                               67</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_135\">  The State has a definite role to play in protecting the\n  witnesses, to start with at least in sensitive cases\n  involving those in power, who have political patronage\n  and could wield muscle and money power, to avert trial\n  getting tainted and derailed and truth becoming a\n  casualty. As a protector of its citizens it has to ensure that\n  during a trial in court the witness could safely depose the\n  truth without any fear of being haunted by those against\n  whom he had deposed. Every State has a constitutional\n  obligation and duty to protect the life and liberty of its\n  citizens. That is the fundamental requirement for\n  observance of the rule of law. There cannot be any\n  deviation from this requirement because of any\n  extraneous factors like caste, creed, religion, political\n  belief or ideology. Every State is supposed to know these\n  fundamental requirements and this needs no retaliation\n  (sic repetition). We can only say this with regard to the\n  criticism levelled against the State of Gujarat. Some\n  legislative enactments like the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_140\">Terrorist and Disruptive\n  Activities (Prevention) Act, 1987</a> (in short &quot;the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_141\">TADA\n  Act</a>&quot;) have taken note of the reluctance shown by\n  witnesses to depose against people with muscle power,\n  money power or political power which has become the\n  order of the day. If ultimately truth is to be arrived at, the\n  eyes and ears of justice have to be protected so that the\n  interests of justice do not get incapacitated in the sense\n  of making the proceedings before the courts mere mock\n  trials as are usually seen in movies.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_136\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1103956\" id=\"span_127\">42. Likewise, in <a href=\"/doc/1103956/\" id=\"a_142\">Sakshi v.

The mere sight of the accused may induce an\n  element of extreme fear in the mind of the victim or the\n  witnesses or can put them in a state of shock. In such a\n  situation he or she may not be able to give full details of\n  the incident which may result in miscarriage of justice.\n  Therefore, a screen or some such arrangement can be\n  made where the victim or witnesses do not have to\n  undergo the trauma of seeing the body or the face of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">                                68</span>\n\n   accused. Often the questions put in cross-examination are\n   purposely designed to embarrass or confuse the victims\n   of rape and child abuse. The object is that out of the\n   feeling of shame or embarrassment, the victim may not\n   speak out or give details of certain acts committed by the\n   accused. It will, therefore, be better if the questions to be\n   put by the accused in cross-examination are given in\n   writing to the presiding officer of the court, who may put\n   the same to the victim or witnesses in a language which\n   is not embarrassing. There can hardly be any objection to\n   the other suggestion given by the petitioner that\n   whenever a child or victim of rape is required to give\n   testimony, sufficient breaks should be given as and when\n   required. The provisions of sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1134316/\" id=\"a_143\">Section\n   327</a> CrPC should also apply in inquiry or trial of offences\n   under <a href=\"/doc/203036/\" id=\"a_144\">Sections 354</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_145\">377</a> IPC.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_137\">43. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"190237958\" id=\"span_129\">In <a href=\"/doc/190237958/\" id=\"a_146\">State v. Sanjeev Nanda</a>, the Court felt constrained in\nreiterating the growing disturbing trend: (SCC pp. 486-87,\nparas 99-101)\n   &quot;99. Witness turning hostile is a major disturbing factor\n   faced by the criminal courts in India. Reasons are many\n   for the witnesses turning hostile, but of late, we see,\n   especially in high profile cases, there is a regularity in the\n   witnesses turning hostile, either due to monetary\n   consideration or by other tempting offers which\n   undermine the entire criminal justice system and people\n   carry the impression that the mighty and powerful can\n   always get away from the clutches of law, thereby\n   eroding people&#x27;s faith in the system.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1967037\" id=\"span_130\">100. This Court in <a href=\"/doc/1967037/\" id=\"a_147\">State of U.P. v. Ramesh Prasad Misra</a>\n   held that it is equally settled law that the evidence of a\n   hostile witness could not be totally rejected, if spoken in\n   favour of the prosecution or the accused, but it can be\n   subjected to closest scrutiny and that portion of the\n   evidence which is consistent with the case of the\n   prosecution or defence may be accepted.</span> In K.\n   Anbazhagan v. Supt. of Police, this Court held that if a\n   court finds that in the process the credit of the witness\n   has not been completely shaken, he may after reading and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                               69</span>\n\n   considering the evidence of the witness as a whole, with\n   due caution, accept, in the light of the evidence on the\n   record that part of his testimony which it finds to be\n   creditworthy and act upon it. This is exactly what was\n   done in the instant case by both the trial court and the\n   High Court and they found the accused guilty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"105430\" id=\"span_132\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1515299\" id=\"span_133\">101. We cannot, however, close our eyes to the disturbing\n   fact in the instant case where even the injured witness,\n   who was present on the spot, turned hostile. This Court in\n   <a href=\"/doc/1515299/\" id=\"a_148\">Manu Sharma v. State (NCT of Delhi</a>) and in <a href=\"/doc/105430/\" id=\"a_149\">Zahira\n   Habibullah Sheikh (5) v. State of Gujarat</a> had highlighted\n   the glaring defects in the system like non-recording of the\n   statements correctly by the police and the retraction of\n   the statements by the prosecution witness due to\n   intimidation, inducement and other methods of\n   manipulation. Courts, however, cannot shut their eyes to\n   the reality. If a witness becomes hostile to subvert the\n   judicial process, the court shall not stand as a mute\n   spectator and every effort should be made to bring home\n   the truth. Criminal judicial system cannot be overturned\n   by those gullible witnesses who act under pressure,\n   inducement or intimidation. Further, <a href=\"/doc/308396/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 193</a> IPC\n   imposes punishment for giving false evidence but is\n   seldom invoked.&quot;</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_140\">44. On the analysis of various cases, the following reasons can\nbe discerned which make witnesses retracting their statements\nbefore the court and turning hostile:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">(i) Threat/Intimidation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">(ii) Inducement by various means.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">(iii) Use of muscle and money power by the accused.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">(iv) Use of stock witnesses.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">(v) Protracted trials.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">(vi) Hassles faced by the witnesses during investigation and\ntrial.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">(vii) Non-existence of any clear-cut legislation to check\nhostility of witness.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_141\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"105430\" id=\"span_134\">45. Threat and intimidation has been one of the major causes\nfor the hostility of witnesses. Bentham said: &quot;witnesses are the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">                                70</span>\n\neyes and ears of justice&quot;. When the witnesses are not able to\ndepose correctly in the court of law, it results in low rate of\nconviction and many times even hardened criminals escape the\nconviction. It shakes public confidence in the criminal justice\ndelivery system. It is for this reason there has been a lot of\ndiscussion on witness protection and from various quarters\ndemand is made for the State to play a definite role in coming\nout with witness protection programme, at least in sensitive\ncases involving those in power, who have political patronage\nand could wield muscle and money power, to avert trial getting\ntainted and derailed and truth becoming a casualty. A stern and\nemphatic message to this effect was given in <a href=\"/doc/105430/\" id=\"a_151\">Zahira\nHabibullah</a> case as well.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_142\">46. Justifying the measures to be taken for witness protection\nto enable the witnesses to depose truthfully and without fear,\nJustice Malimath Committee Report on Reforms of Criminal\nJustice System, 2003 has remarked as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">   &quot;11.3. Another major problem is about safety of\n   witnesses and their family members who face danger at\n   different stages. They are often threatened and the\n   seriousness of the threat depends upon the type of the\n   case and the background of the accused and his family.\n   Many times crucial witnesses are threatened or injured\n   prior to their testifying in the court. If the witness is still\n   not amenable he may even be murdered. In such\n   situations the witness will not come forward to give\n   evidence unless he is assured of protection or is\n   guaranteed anonymity of some form of physical disguise.\n   ... Time has come for a comprehensive law being enacted\n   for protection of the witness and members of his family.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_143\">47. Almost to similar effect are the observations of the Law\nCommission of India in its 198th Report, as can be seen from\nthe following discussion therein:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">   &quot;The reason is not far to seek. In the case of victims of\n   terrorism and sexual offences against women and\n   juveniles, we are dealing with a section of society\n   consisting of very vulnerable people, be they victims or\n   witnesses. The victims and witnesses are under fear of or\n   danger to their lives or lives of their relations or to their\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">                               71</span>\n\n   property. It is obvious that in the case of serious offences\n   under the Penal Code, 1860 and other special enactments,\n   some of which we have <a href=\"/doc/105430/\" id=\"a_152\">referred to above</a>, there are\n   bound to be absolutely similar situations for victims and\n   witnesses. While in the case of certain offences under\n   special statutes such fear or danger to victims and\n   witnesses may be more common and pronounced, in the\n   case of victims and witnesses involved or concerned with\n   some serious offences, fear may be no less important.\n   Obviously, if the trial in the case of special offences is to\n   be fair both to the accused as well as to the\n   victims/witnesses, then there is no reason as to why it\n   should not be equally fair in the case of other general\n   offences of serious nature falling under the Penal Code,\n   1860. It is the fear or danger or rather the likelihood\n   thereof that is common to both cases. That is why several\n   general statutes in other countries provide for victim and\n   witness protection.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_144\">48. Apart from the above, another significant reason for\nwitnesses turning hostile may be what is described as &quot;culture\nof compromise&quot;. Commenting upon such culture in rape trials,\nPratiksha Bakshi has highlighted this problem in the following\nmanner:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">   &quot;During the trial, compromise acts as a tool in the hands\n   of defence lawyers and the accused to pressurise\n   complainants and victims to change their testimonies in a\n   courtroom. Let us turn to a recent case from Agra\n   wherein a young Dalit woman was gang-raped and the\n   rapist let off on bail. The accused threatened to rape the\n   victim again if she did not compromise. Nearly a year\n   after she was raped, she committed suicide. While we\n   find that the judgment records that the victim committed\n   suicide following the pressure to compromise, the\n   judgment does not criminalise the pressure to\n   compromise as criminal intimidation of the victim and\n   her family. The normalising function of the socio-legal\n   category of compromise converts terror into a bargain in\n   a context where there is no witness protection\n   programme. This often accounts for why prosecution\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                               72</span>\n\n  witnesses routinely turn hostile by the time the case\n  comes on trial, if the victim does not lose the will to live.\n  In other words, I have shown how legality is actually\n  perceived as disruptive of sociality; in this instance, a\n  sociality that is marked by caste based patriarchies, such\n  that compromise is actively perceived, to put it in the\n  words of a woman Judge of a District Court, as a\n  mechanism for &#x27;restoring social relations in society&#x27;.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">49. In this regard, two articles by Daniela Berti delve into a\nsociological analysis of hostile witnesses, noting how village\ncompromises (and possibly peer pressure) are a reason for\nwitnesses turning hostile. In one of his articles, he writes:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">  &quot;For reasons that cannot be explained here, even the\n  people who initiate a legal case may change their minds\n  later on and pursue non-official forms of compromise or\n  adjustment. Ethnographic observations of the cases that\n  do make it to the criminal courtroom thus provide insight\n  into the kinds of tensions that arise between local society\n  and the State judicial administration. These tensions are\n  particularly palpable when witnesses deny before the\n  Judge what they allegedly said to the police during\n  preliminary investigations. At this very moment they\n  often become hostile. Here I must point out that the\n  problem of what in common law terminology is called\n  &quot;hostile witnesses&quot; is, in fact, general in India and has\n  provoked many a reaction from Judges and politicians, as\n  well as countless debates in newspaper editorials.\n  Although this problem assumes particular relevance at\n  high-profile, well-publicised trials, where witnesses may\n  be politically pressured or bribed, it is a recurring\n  everyday situation with which Judges and prosecutors of\n  any small district town are routinely faced. In many such\n  cases, the hostile behaviour results from various\n  dynamics that interfere with the trial&#x27;s outcome -- village\n  or family solidarity, the sharing of the same illegal\n  activity for which the accused has been incriminated (as\n  in case of cannabis cultivation), political interests, family\n  pressures, various forms of economic compensation, and\n  so forth. Sometimes the witness becomes &quot;hostile&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                                     73</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_146\">         simply because police records of his or her earlier\n         testimony are plainly wrong. Judges themselves are well\n         aware that the police do write false statements for the\n         purpose of strengthening their cases. Though well known\n         in judicial milieus, the dynamics just described have not\n         yet been studied as they unfold over the course of a trial.\n         My research suggests, however, that the witness&#x27;s\n         withdrawal from his or her previous statement is a crucial\n         moment in the trial, one that clearly encapsulates the\n         tensions arising between those involved in a trial and the\n         court machinery itself.&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">         &quot;In my fieldwork experiences, witnesses become\n         &quot;hostile&quot; not only when they are directly implicated in a\n         case filed by the police, but also when they are on the\n         side of the plaintiff&#x27;s party. During the often rather long\n         period that elapses between the police investigation and\n         the trial itself, I often observed, the party who has lodged\n         the complaint (and who becomes the main witness) can\n         irreparably compromise the case with the other party by\n         means of compensation, threat or blackmail.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_147\">      50. The present case appears to have been stung by &quot;culture of\n      compromise&quot;. Fortunately, statement of PW 4 in attempting to\n      shield the accused Ramesh has been proved to be false in view\n      of the records of PGIMS, Rohtak and, therefore, we held that\n      the High Court was right in discarding his testimony.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_148\">67.    Thus, it is clear that this Court by disbelieving the witnesses\nmerely because they could not withstand the fear or pressure of the\nlitigating parties, or accused, cannot encourage the culture of\ncompromise. One must not forget that an offence is not against an\nindividual but it is against the Society. Even as per Civil Procedure\nCode, the Trial Court before accepting an application filed under Order\n23 Rule 3, has to satisfy itself that the Compromise has been arrived at\nvoluntarily and by lawful agreement/compromise. Thus, viewed from\nany angle, the culture of compromise cannot be encouraged.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                                       74</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_149\">68.      From the above judgment, it is clear that merely because a witness\nhas turned hostile, would not mean that his entire evidence shall stand\nwiped out, and there is no bar in convicting the accused on the basis of\nevidence of hostile witness. However, the evidence of a witness is in the\nrealm of appreciation of evidence and question of fact is to be decided in\nthe light of facts and circumstances of the case.\nWhether there was any light at the place of incident and whether this\nwitness could have identified the assailants\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_150\">69.      It is submitted by Shri K.T.S. Tulsi, Senior Advocate that there was\nload shedding from 19:55 to 20:10, and according to the statement made\nto Doctor, Ex. D.4, this witness had stated that the incident took place at\n20:00, therefore, it is clear that there was no light on the spot, thus, it was\nnot possible for this witness to identify the assailants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_151\">70.      Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the\nAppellants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_152\">71.      In order to prove that there was load shedding from 19:55 till\n20:10, the Counsel for the Appellants have relied upon the evidence of\nRajendra Kumar Agrawal (P.W.17) who has proved that as per\ndistribution register, <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_153\">Article 6</a>, there was load shedding from 19:55 til\n20:10.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_153\">72.      Thus, it is clear from the evidence of Rajendra Kumar Agrawal\n(P.W.17), there was load shedding from 19:55 till 20:10 but now the\nquestion is that whether incident took place in between 19:55 and 20:10\nor the incident took place after 20:10.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_154\">73.      It is submitted by the Counsel for the Appellants that Yuvraj\n(P.W.1) in his statement to Doctor, Ex.

Further, in the spot map, no source of light was shown by the\ninvestigating officer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_155\">74.      Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the\nAppellants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_156\">75.      The statement of Yuvraj (P.W.1), Ex.

Thus, from the above mentioned statement, Ex. D.4, it is clear that\nthe injured Yuvraj (P.W.1) had not stated with certainty that the incident\ntook place at 8:00 P.M., but he expressed that he doesnot know the exact\ntime, but it might be 8:00 P.M. Thus, no conclusion can be drawn from\nthe statement of Yuvraj (P.W.1), Ex. D.4, that the incident took place at\n20:00.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                                     76</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_159\">77.      Furthermore, the Appellants themselves have relied upon the\nRojnamcha No. 908 of Police Station Gola Ka Mandir which was\nrecorded at 80:30, Ex. D.13 in which it was mentioned that an\ninformation has been received that firing is going on at Pinto Park and\nsome persons have sustained injuries. The use of words &quot;Firing is\ngoing on&quot;, clearly means that when the firing started, some one informed\nthe police station Gola Ka Mandir. Since, this rojnamcha sanha, Ex.\nD.13 has been relied upon by the Appellants themselves, therefore, it is\nclear that the firing must have taken place much after 20:10, therefore, it\nis clear that there was no load shedding at the time, when firing took\nplace.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_160\">78.      Further more, it is the case of the prosecution that Autar and\nKaptan were on their motor cycle and were moving slowly in front of the\nvehicle of the deceased and thereafter, the remaining accused persons\ncame on a Scorpio car. Thus, the vehicles had their headlights, and\nYuvraj (P.W.1) has stated that the accused persons were known to him\nbecause not only they had enmity with Sughar Singh but they were also\nthe resident of the same locality. Thus, it is clear that this witness had\nample opportunity and sufficient light to identify the assailants. Thus, it\nis held that the incident took place after 20:10 and there was no load\nshedding at the time of incident and there was sufficient light on the spot.\nFurther more, it is clear from the post-mortem report of Sughar Singh,\nEx. P.2, few gunshots were fired from a very close range. Yuvraj (P.W.1)\nwas already sitting inside the same vehicle. For firing at Sughar Singh,\nthe assailants had come very close to the Safari vehicle. The assailants\nwere already known to the witness, therefore, he had full opportunity to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">                                      77</span>\n\nidentify the accused persons. Further the police statement of this witness\nwas recorded on the next day, Ex. D.3, and in that statement, he had\nspecifically stated about the source of light and had claimed that he had\nwitnessed the incident in the Halogen light as well as the light of the\nshops.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_161\">Non-mention of names of other assailants in statement given to Doctor,\nEx. D.4.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_162\">79.   It is submitted by the Counsel for the Appellants that statement\nmade by this witness to Doctor, Ex. D.4 is his earliest version and in that\nstatement, he had not disclosed the names of any other assailant except\nRustam Singh, therefore, an attempt was made by this witness to over\nimplicate other accused persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_163\">80.   Considered the submissions made by the Counsel for the\nAppellants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_164\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158640398\" id=\"span_143\">81.      The incident took place in between 20:10 and 20:30. Yuvraj\n(P.W.1) was admitted in the hospital at 21:05. It is clear from medical\ncase sheet of this witness, that he was put on oxygen at 21:15. Doctor\nArun Kumar (P.W.14) was informed about the patient at 21:30. The\nstatement of this witness, Ex. D.4 was recorded by the Doctor at 23:35.\nThe patient was taken for operation and his entry time in Operation\nTheater is 23:45 and was taken out of operation theater at 2:30 <a href=\"/doc/158640398/\" id=\"a_154\">A.M.\nFrom the Medical</a> case sheet, Ex. P. 41C, it is clear that immediately after\nhis admission in the hospital, he was given various treatment including\nsedatives. Since, the witness was taken to operation theater immediately\nafter the recording of his statement by the Doctor, Ex. D.4, therefore, it is\nclear that he was under heavy medication. Thus, at the time of recording\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_144\">                                     78</span>\n\nof statement, Ex. D.4 by the Doctor, it is clear that the patient was under</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">immense pain as well as was under the effect of sedatives. Therefore, if\nhe expressed that now he doesnot want to say anything more to the\nDoctor, then such a stand taken by this witness cannot be said to be an\nattempt to leave room for over implicating others. It is not the case of the\nAppellants, that the Appellants are unknown to Rustam Yadav. Rustam\nYadav was specifically named in the statement, Ex. D.4. Number of gun\nshot marks were found on the Safari Car, as well as number of gun shots\nwere suffered by the injured Yuvraj (P.W.1) and the deceased Sughar\nSingh, Jagdish and Sintu, thus, it is clear that heavy indiscriminate firing\nwas done. Therefore, it is clear that number of accused persons were\ninvolved who were firing indiscriminately. Thus, non-mentioning of\nnames of other assailants in statement, Ex.

It is true that abscondence immediately after the incident by\nitself may not be indicative of their guilty mind, but if other\ncircumstances prove their involvement in the incident, then their\nabscondence after the incident, becomes an incriminating circumstance.\nThe Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1053935/\" id=\"a_155\">Kundula Bala Subrahmanyam v.\nState of A.P.</a>, reported in (1993) 2 SCC 684 has held as under :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">      23.....No explanation, worth the name, much less a satisfactory\n      explanation has been furnished by the Appellants about their\n      absence from the village till they surrendered in the court in the\n      face of such a gruesome &#x27;tragedy&#x27;. Indeed, absconding by itself\n      may not be a positive circumstance consistent only with the\n      hypothesis of guilt of the accused because it is not unknown\n      that even innocent persons may run away for fear of being\n      falsely involved in a criminal case and arrested by the police,\n      but coupled with the other circumstances which we have\n      discussed above, the absconding of the Appellants assumes\n      importance and significance.

Whether the abscondence of an accused can be taken as a\n      circumstance against him has been considered by this Court in\n      <a href=\"/doc/1524844/\" id=\"a_157\">Bipin Kumar Mondal v.

State of U.P.</a> this Court repelled the\n      submissions made by the State that as after commission of the\n      offence the accused had been absconding, therefore, the\n      inference can be drawn that he was a guilty person observing\n      as under: (SCC p. 84, para 19)\n      &#x27;19. The Appellant&#x27;s conduct in absconding was also relied\n      upon. Now, mere absconding by itself does not necessarily lead\n      to a firm conclusion of guilty mind. Even an innocent man may\n      feel panicky and try to evade arrest when wrongly suspected of\n      a grave crime such is the instinct of self-preservation. The act\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_150\">                                     80</span>\n\n      of absconding is no doubt relevant piece of evidence to be\n      considered along with other evidence but its value would\n      always depend on the circumstances of each case. Normally the\n      courts are disinclined to attach much importance to the act of\n      absconding, treating it as a very small item in the evidence for\n      sustaining conviction. It can scarcely be held as a determining\n      link in completing the chain of circumstantial evidence which\n      must admit of no other reasonable hypothesis than that of the\n      guilt of the accused. In the present case the Appellant was with\n      Ram Chandra till the FIR was lodged. If thereafter he felt that\n      he was being wrongly suspected and he tried to keep out of the\n      way we do not think this circumstance can be considered to be\n      necessarily evidence of a guilty mind attempting to evade\n      justice. It is not inconsistent with his innocence.&#x27;\n                          *       *     *</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">      28. Abscondence by a person against whom FIR has been\n      lodged, having an apprehension of being apprehended by the\n      police, cannot be said to be unnatural. Thus, in view of the\n      above, we do not find any force in the submission made by Shri\n      Bhattacharjee that mere absconding by the Appellant after\n      commission of the crime and remaining untraceable for such a\n      long time itself can establish his guilt. Absconding by itself is\n      not conclusive either of guilt or of guilty conscience.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1182563\" id=\"span_151\">While deciding the said case, a large number of earlier\n      judgments were also taken into consideration by the Court,\n      including <a href=\"/doc/1182563/\" id=\"a_159\">Matru and State of M.P. v.

Thus, in a case of this nature, the mere abscondence of an\n      accused does not lead to a firm conclusion of his guilty mind.\n      An innocent man may also abscond in order to evade arrest, as\n      in light of such a situation, such an action may be part of the\n      natural conduct of the accused. Abscondence is in fact relevant\n      evidence, but its evidentiary value depends upon the\n      surrounding circumstances, and hence, the same must only be\n      taken as a minor item in evidence for sustaining conviction.\n      (See <a href=\"/doc/969015/\" id=\"a_160\">Paramjeet Singh v.

P.41C, it is clear that on 17-7-2006, the general condition of the\npatient was critical. Immediately after the operation, the patient was\nfound to be suffering from paraplegia. Steroids were being given. A\ndetailed cross-examination of Yuvraj (P.W.1) was done and it was\nspecifically stated by this witness, that after the operation, he was kept in\na separate ward and nobody else was there. He had not met with Hariom.\nNo body else had met him. Thus, it is clear that no body had met him\nafter the operation and he was kept in an isolated ward and this witness\nwas under heavy medication and had also suffered paraplegia, and for\nsome time he must be under the effect of anesthesia. This Court is of the\nconsidered opinion, that there was no occasion for this witness to concoct\na theory in order to falsely over-implicate any of the accused. In his\npolice statement, Ex. D.3, this witness has specifically narrated the role\nplayed by Autar, Kaptan, Rustam, Mohar Singh, Cheeku, Ballu, Bablu,\nBalli, Dinesh Yadav and Dinesh Jat.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_171\">86.   Thus, this Court is of the considered opinion, that the examination-\nin-chief as well as the cross-examination of Yuvraj (P.W.1) which was\nconcluded on 5-9-2007 is trustworthy and is corroborated by other\nsurrounding circumstances, therefore, his further cross-examination, done\nafter his recall which was recorded after three years of his initial cross-\nexamination will not efface the earlier version/evidence of this witness.\nAccordingly, he is held to be a reliable and trustworthy witness.\nb.

His family was having enmity with the family of Rustam Singh\nYadav on election issues. During the elections also, Rustam Singh had\nfired at Sughar Singh and thereafter, Rustam, Mahendra and their father\nSitaram had left their house.      However, they were always hatching\nconspiracy for killing Sughar Singh.        About 4-5 months back also,\nSitaram, Rustam and Mahendra had planned for killing Sughar Singh.\nWhen Sughar Singh came to know, then a dispute also arose with\nSitaram.

He had advised Sughar Singh to remain\nmore vigilant. He had gone towards Pinto Park at about 8:00 to 8:30\nP.M. He was standing near Bajrang Grocery shop. He heard the noise of\ngun shot fires. He saw that gun shots were being fired towards his\nvehicle. Rustam, Mohar Singh, Kallu, Cheeku @ Sohan Singh, Balli S/o\nShiv Charan got down from cream coloured Scorpio. Cheeku, Balli and\nKallu were having .315 bore gun, whereas Mohar Singh was having .12\nbore gun and Rustam Singh was having .315 bore mouzer. They were\nfiring indiscriminately. Accordingly Jagdish died on the spot whereas he\ntook his brother Sughar Singh to hospital, where he was declared dead.\nYuvraj is taking treatment in the hospital and one Sintu has also expired\non the spot. Along with Rustam Singh, 3-4 more persons were also there\nwho had also fired gun shots. Thereafter, all the assailants escaped from\nthe spot on their vehicle.

It is well established principle of law that the evidence as a whole\nshould be considered and picking up one sentence from here and there is\nnot the proper way of appreciation of evidence.

The\n      assertion by witness Jhabbulal that after the incident was over\n      he had gone near his injured brother and tried to know as to\n      who were his assailants, whereupon his injured brother had\n      replied that the appellants (sic respondents) had caused injuries\n      to him, could not be effectively challenged during cross-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_181\">      examination of the witness nor could it be brought on record\n      that because of the nature of the injuries received by Baburam\n      he would not have survived even for a few minutes and must\n      have died immediately on the receipt of the injuries.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_182\">      74. The net result of the above discussion is that the High\n      Court has acquitted the respondents who were charged for\n      commission of six murders in a casual and slipshod manner.\n      The approach of the High Court in appreciating the evidence is\n      not only contrary to the well-settled principles of appreciation\n      of evidence but quite contrary to ground realities of life. The\n      High Court has recorded reasons for acquittal of the\n      respondents which are not borne out from the record and are\n      quite contrary to the evidences adduced by the reliable\n      eyewitnesses. The High Court was not justified in upsetting\n      well-reasoned conviction of the respondents recorded by the\n      trial court which after observing demeanour of the\n      eyewitnesses had placed reliance on their testimony.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_183\">      75.

The general impression this Court has\n      gathered is that appreciation of evidence by the High Court is\n      cursory and it has done injustice to the prosecution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"113701963\" id=\"span_160\">95.

It is vehemently contended that the evidence of the\n      prosecution witnesses is exaggerated and thus false.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_185\">      Cambridge Dictionary defines &quot;exaggeration&quot; as &quot;the fact of\n      making something larger, more important, better or worse than\n      it really is&quot;. Merriam-Webster defines the term &quot;exaggerate&quot; as\n      to &quot;enlarge beyond bounds or the truth&quot;. The Concise Oxford\n      English Dictionary defines it as &quot;enlarged or altered beyond\n      normal proportions&quot;. These expressions unambiguously\n      suggest that the genesis of an &quot;exaggerated statement&quot; lies in a\n      true fact, to which fictitious additions are made so as to make it\n      more penetrative. Every exaggeration, therefore, has the\n      ingredients of &quot;truth&quot;. No exaggerated statement is possible\n      without an element of truth. On the other hand, Advanced Law\n      Lexicon defines &quot;false&quot; as &quot;erroneous, untrue; opposite of\n      correct, or true&quot;. Concise Oxford English Dictionary states that\n      &quot;false&quot; is &quot;wrong; not correct or true&quot;. Similar is the\n      explanation in other dictionaries as well. There is, thus, a\n      marked differentia between an &quot;exaggerated version&quot; and a\n      &quot;false version&quot;. An exaggerated statement contains both truth\n      and falsity, whereas a false statement has no grain of truth in it\n      (being the &quot;opposite&quot; of &quot;true&quot;). It is well said that to make a\n      mountain out of a molehill, the molehill shall have to exist\n      primarily. A court of law, being mindful of such distinction is\n      duty-bound to disseminate &quot;truth&quot; from &quot;falsehood&quot; and sift\n      the grain from the chaff in case of exaggerations. It is only in a\n      case where the grain and the chaff are so inextricably\n      intertwined that in their separation no real evidence survives,\n      that the whole evidence can be discarded.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_186\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"88914\" id=\"span_161\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"88914\" id=\"span_162\">26.

So far as this contention is concerned it must be\n   kept in view that while appreciating the evidence of\n   witnesses in a criminal trial especially in a case of\n   eyewitnesses the maxim falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus\n   cannot apply and the court has to make efforts to sift the\n   grain from the chaff. It is of course true that when a\n   witness is said to have exaggerated in his evidence at the\n   stage of trial and has tried to involve many more\n   accused and if that part of the evidence is not found\n   acceptable the remaining part of evidence has to be\n   scrutinised with care and the court must try to see\n   whether the acceptable part of the evidence gets\n   corroborated from other evidence on record so that the\n   acceptable part can be safely relied upon.&quot;</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_187\">                                          (emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_188\">27.

While appreciating the evidence of a witness, the court has\n      to assess whether read as a whole, it is truthful. In doing so, the\n      court has to keep in mind the deficiencies, drawbacks and\n      infirmities to find out whether such discrepancies shake the\n      truthfulness. Some discrepancies not touching the core of the\n      case are not enough to reject the evidence as a whole. No true\n      witness can escape from giving some discrepant details. Only\n      when discrepancies are so incompatible as to affect the\n      credibility of the version of a witness, the court may reject the\n      evidence. <a href=\"/doc/69347904/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 155</a> of the Evidence Act enables the doubt to\n      impeach the credibility of the witness by proof of former\n      inconsistent statement. <a href=\"/doc/1110615/\" id=\"a_177\">Section 145</a> of the Evidence Act lays\n      down the procedure for contradicting a witness by drawing his\n      attention to the part of the previous statement which is to be\n      used for contradiction. The former statement should have the\n      effect of discrediting the present statement but merely because\n      the latter statement is at variance to the former to some extent,\n      it is not enough to be treated as a contradiction. It is not every\n      discrepancy which affects the creditworthiness and the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">                                      89</span>\n\n      trustworthiness of a witness. There may at times be\n      exaggeration or embellishment not affecting the credibility.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_197\">      The court has to sift the chaff from the grain and find out the\n      truth. A statement may be partly rejected or partly accepted.\n      Want of independent witnesses or unusual behaviour of\n      witnesses of a crime is not enough to reject evidence. A witness\n      being a close relative is not enough to reject his testimony if it\n      is otherwise credible. A relation may not conceal the actual\n      culprit. The evidence may be closely scrutinised to assess\n      whether an innocent person is falsely implicated. Mechanical\n      rejection of evidence even of a &quot;partisan&quot; or &quot;interested&quot;\n      witness may lead to failure of justice. It is well known that\n      principle &quot;falsus in uno, falsus in omnibus&quot; has no general\n      acceptability. On the same evidence, some accused persons\n      may be acquitted while others may be convicted, depending\n      upon the nature of the offence. The court can differentiate the\n      accused who is acquitted from those who are convicted. A\n      witness may be untruthful in some aspects but the other part of\n      the evidence may be worthy of acceptance. Discrepancies may\n      arise due to error of observations, loss of memory due to lapse\n      of time, mental disposition such as shock at the time of\n      occurrence and as such the normal discrepancy does not affect\n      the credibility of a witness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_198\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"111899692\" id=\"span_177\">97.

Hariom\nhad given information to the T.I., and thereafter, T.I. had instructed to this\nwitness who in his turn, prepared the spot map.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_207\">102. Hariom (P.W.6) has stated in para 34 of his cross-examination, that\nspot map, Ex. P.9 was not prepared at 9:25 P.M. in his presence. In para\n5 of his cross-examination, he stated that after recording of Dehati\nNalishi, he was informed by Muneesh Rajoria (P.W.20) that he has\nprepared the spot map, Ex.

As already observed in the previous paragraph, the Court must not\nforget the ground realities, the situation at the time and immediately after\nthe incident, the reactions of the witnesses which may differ from one\nperson to another.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_211\">106. It is the evidence of Hariom (P.W.6) that he had gone to Bajrang\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_188\">                                    95</span>\n\nGrocery shop and there he heard the noise of gun shots and then he saw\nthat gun shots were being fired on his vehicle. Muneesh Rajoria (P.W.18)\nhas stated that when he reached on the spot, Hariom (P.W.6) was present.\nThe spot map, Ex. P.9 was prepared on the instructions of Hariom\n(P.W.6), but before the spot map, Ex. P.9 could be concluded, Hariom\n(P.W.6) had left for hospital along with his brother Sughar Singh. Thus,\nit is clear that after Muneesh Rajoria (P.W.18) reached on the spot,\nHariom (P.W.6) was in the process of takingSughar Singh out of the\nSafari Car, and after informing Muneesh Rajoira (P.W.18), Hariom\n(P.W.6) went to J.A. Hospital along with the injured/deceased Sughar\nSingh and thus, the signatures of Hariom (P.W.6) could not be obtained\non the spot map, Ex. P.9.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_212\">107. Now the question is that whether the spot map, Ex. P.9 contains\nany information which was within personal knowledge of Hariom (P.W.6)\nor the spot map, Ex. P.9, merely contains the description of situation\nwhich was visible to anybody including the investigating officer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_213\">108. Spot map, Ex. P.9, merely contains the sketch of the spot which\nwas visible to the investigating officer, Muneesh Rajoria (P.W.18) and it\ndoesnot contain any description, which was in the personal knowledge of\nHariom (P.W.6). The spot map, Ex. P.9 contains the situation prevailing\non the spot. One car is shown on the road. Shops are shown on one side\nof the road. On the other side of the road, Panchayat Bhavan and temple\nare shown and one road is shown which is also known as C.P. Industries\nroad. It is also mentioned in the spot map, Ex. P.9 that deceased Jagdish\nis in dead condition whereas injured Yuvraj and his rifle are on middle\nrow. The accused persons had chased the Safari Car from the side of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_189\">                                      96</span>\n\nPinto Park Triangle and fired from place G and H. Empty cartridges have\nalso been found at that place. Thus, except the information that the\nassailants had chased the victims from the side of Pinto Park Triangle and\ngun shots were fired from G and H, no other information is mentioned\nwhich could not have been noticed by the investigating officer, Muneesh\nRajoria (P.W.18).    This limited information regarding the manner in\nwhich offence was committed supports the evidence of Muneesh Rajoria\n(P.W.18) that Hariom (P.W.6) after informing him about the incident, left\nfor hospital along with his brother Sughar Singh.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_214\">109. Further more, the conduct of Hariom (P.W.6) in rushing to the\nhospital along with injured/deceased Sughar Singh, cannot be said to be\nan unnatural act. The first attempt of every body would be to take the\ninjured to hospital, as early as possible, so that the life of the injured can\nbe saved. Hariom (P.W.6) is the real brother of deceased Sughar Singh.\nThus, it was not expected from him that instead of taking his brother to\nhospital, he should have stayed back on the spot for completing the\nformalities specifically when it was not known to this witness that\nwhether Sughar Singh has actually died or is alive.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_215\">110.

This Court has already held that the further\ncross-examination of Yuvraj (P.W.1) after his recall can at the most be\ntreated as an evidence of a hostile witness and since, the earlier part of\nevidence of Yuvraj (P.W.1) has been found to be reliable as it is\ncorroborated by other circumstances, therefore, this Court is of the\nconsidered opinion, that the presence of Hariom (P.W.6) on the spot\ncannot be doubted on the basis of somersault taken by Yuvraj (P.W.6)\nafter his recall.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_228\">122.

This is what this Court said: (AIR p. 331, para 6)\n        &quot;6. There can be no doubt that in a murder case when\n        evidence is given by near relatives of the victim and the\n        murder is alleged to have been committed by the enemy\n        of the family, criminal courts must examine the evidence\n        of the interested witnesses, like the relatives of the\n        victim, very carefully.</span> ... But where the witness is a close\n        relation of the victim and is shown to share the victim&#x27;s\n        hostility to his assailant, that naturally makes it necessary\n        for the criminal courts to examine the evidence given by\n        such witness very carefully and scrutinise all the\n        infirmities in that evidence before deciding to act upon it.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_237\">        In dealing with such evidence, courts naturally begin\n        with the enquiry as to whether the said witnesses were\n        chance witnesses or whether they were really present on\n        the scene of the offence. ... If the criminal court is\n        satisfied that the witness who is related to the victim was\n        not a chance witness, then his evidence has to be\n        examined from the point of view of probabilities and the\n        account given by him as to the assault has to be carefully\n        scrutinised.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_238\">     20.

It was held that: (SCC p. 754, para 7)\n   &quot;7. ... True, it is, she is the wife of the deceased; but she\n   cannot be called an &#x27;interested&#x27; witness.

A\n   witness may be called &#x27;interested&#x27; only when he or she\n   derives some benefit from the result of a litigation; in the\n   decree in a civil case, or in seeing an accused person\n   punished.

In Basawan Singh, a trap\nwitness (who would be a natural eyewitness) was considered\nan interested witness since he was &quot;concerned in the success of\nthe trap&quot;. The Constitution Bench held: (AIR p. 506, para 15)\n   &quot;15. ... The correct rule is this: if any of the witnesses are\n   accomplices who are particeps criminis in respect of the\n   actual crime charged, their evidence must be treated as\n   the evidence of accomplices is treated; if they are not\n   accomplices but are partisan or interested witnesses, who\n   are concerned in the success of the trap, their evidence\n   must be tested in the same way as other interested\n   evidence is tested by the application of diverse\n   considerations which must vary from case to case, and in\n   a proper case, the court may even look for independent\n   corroboration before convicting the accused person.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_246\">23.

But, more than\nthe categorisation of a witness, the issue really is one of\nappreciation of the evidence of a witness. A court should\nexamine the evidence of a related and interested witness\nhaving an interest in seeing the accused punished and also\nhaving some enmity with the accused with greater care and\ncaution than the evidence of a third party disinterested and\nunrelated witness.

In the present case, PW 5 Srinivasan is not only a related\nand interested witness, but also someone who has an enmity\nwith the appellants. His evidence, therefore, needs to be\nscrutinised with great care and caution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_249\">26. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"770422\" id=\"span_216\">In <a href=\"/doc/770422/\" id=\"a_212\">Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab</a> this Court observed,\nwithout any generalisation, that a related witness would\nordinarily speak the truth, but in the case of an enmity there\nmay be a tendency to drag in an innocent person as an accused</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_250\">--each case has to be considered on its own facts. This is what\nthis Court had to say: (AIR p. 366, para 26)\n   &quot;26. A witness is normally to be considered independent\n   unless he or she springs from sources which are likely to\n   be tainted and that usually means unless the witness has\n   cause, such as enmity against the accused, to wish to\n   implicate him falsely. Ordinarily, a close relation would\n   be the last to screen the real culprit and falsely implicate\n   an innocent person. It is true, when feelings run high and\n   there is personal cause for enmity, that there is a tendency\n   to drag in an innocent person against whom a witness has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_217\">                               106</span>\n\n   a grudge along with the guilty, but foundation must be\n   laid for such a criticism and the mere fact of relationship\n   far from being a foundation is often a sure guarantee of\n   truth. However, we are not attempting any sweeping\n   generalisation. Each case must be judged on its own\n   facts. Our observations are only made to combat what is\n   so often put forward in cases before us as a general rule\n   of prudence. There is no such general rule. Each case\n   must be limited to and be governed by its own facts.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_251\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1956224\" id=\"span_218\">27. How the evidence of such a witness should be looked at\nwas again considered in <a href=\"/doc/1956224/\" id=\"a_213\">Darya Singh v. State of Punjab</a>. This\nCourt was of the opinion that a related or interested witness\nmay not be hostile to the assailant, but if he is, then his\nevidence must be examined very carefully and all the\ninfirmities taken into account. It was observed that where the\nwitness shares the hostility of the victim against the assailant,\nit would be unlikely that he would not name the real assailant\nbut would substitute the real assailant with the &quot;enemy&quot; of the\nvictim. This is what this Court said: (AIR p. 331, para 6)\n   &quot;6. There can be no doubt that in a murder case when\n   evidence is given by near relatives of the victim and the\n   murder is alleged to have been committed by the enemy\n   of the family, criminal courts must examine the evidence\n   of the interested witnesses, like the relatives of the\n   victim, very carefully. But a person may be interested in\n   the victim, being his relation or otherwise, and may not\n   necessarily be hostile to the accused. In that case, the fact\n   that the witness was related to the victim or was his\n   friend, may not necessarily introduce any infirmity in his\n   evidence. But where the witness is a close relation of the\n   victim and is shown to share the victim&#x27;s hostility to his\n   assailant, that naturally makes it necessary for the\n   criminal courts to examine the evidence given by such\n   witness very carefully and scrutinise all the infirmities in\n   that evidence before deciding to act upon it. ... [I]t may\n   be relevant to remember that though the witness is hostile\n   to the assailant, it is not likely that he would deliberately\n   omit to name the real assailant and substitute in his place\n   the name of the enemy of the family out of malice. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_219\">                              107</span>\n\n   desire to punish the victim would be so powerful in his\n   mind that he would unhesitatingly name the real assailant\n   and would not think of substituting in his place the\n   enemy of the family though he was not concerned with\n   the assault. It is not improbable that in giving evidence,\n   such a witness may name the real assailant and may add\n   other persons out of malice and enmity and that is a\n   factor which has to be borne in mind in appreciating the\n   evidence of interested witnesses. On principle, however,\n   it is difficult to accept the plea that if a witness is shown\n   to be a relative of the deceased and it is also shown that\n   he shared the hostility of the victim towards the assailant,\n   his evidence can never be accepted unless it is\n   corroborated on material particulars.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_252\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"173310636\" id=\"span_220\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"17399\" id=\"span_221\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1946408\" id=\"span_222\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"197643\" id=\"span_223\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"510098\" id=\"span_224\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1999217\" id=\"span_225\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"933091\" id=\"span_226\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"213150\" id=\"span_227\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"320833\" id=\"span_228\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"173310636\" id=\"span_229\">28. More recently, in <a href=\"/doc/173310636/\" id=\"a_214\">Waman v. State of Maharashtra</a> this Court\ndealt with the case of a related witness (though not a witness\ninimical to the assailant) and while referring to and relying\nupon <a href=\"/doc/320833/\" id=\"a_215\">Sarwan Singh v.

It is clear that merely because the witnesses are\n   related to the complainant or the deceased, their evidence\n   cannot be thrown out. If their evidence is found to be\n   consistent and true, the fact of being a relative cannot by\n   itself discredit their evidence. In other words, the\n   relationship is not a factor to affect the credibility of a\n   witness and the courts have to scrutinise their evidence\n   meticulously with a little care.&quot;</span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_253\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"320833\" id=\"span_230\">29. The sum and substance is that the evidence of a related or\ninterested witness should be meticulously and carefully\nexamined. In a case where the related and interested witness\nmay have some enmity with the assailant, the bar would need\nto be raised and the evidence of the witness would have to be\nexamined by applying a standard of discerning scrutiny.\nHowever, this is only a rule of prudence and not one of law, as\nheld in Dalip Singh and pithily reiterated in Sarwan Singh in\nthe following words: (<a href=\"/doc/320833/\" id=\"a_224\">Sarwan Singh</a> case, SCC p. 376, para</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_231\">                                    108</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_254\">     10)\n       &quot;10. ... The evidence of an interested witness does not\n       suffer from any infirmity as such, but the courts require as\n       a rule of prudence, not as a rule of law, that the evidence\n       of such witnesses should be scrutinised with a little care.\n       Once that approach is made and the court is satisfied that\n       the evidence of interested witnesses have a ring of truth\n       such evidence could be relied upon even without\n       corroboration.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_255\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"89535248\" id=\"span_232\">131.

We are unable to agree with the learned Judges of\n      the High Court that the testimony of the two\n      eyewitnesses requires corroboration. If the foundation for\n      such an observation is based on the fact that the\n      witnesses are women and that the fate of seven men\n      hangs on their testimony, we know of no such rule. If it is\n      grounded on the reason that they are closely related to the\n      deceased we are unable to concur. This is a fallacy\n      common to many criminal cases and one which another\n      Bench of this Court endeavoured to dispel in <a href=\"/doc/1420504/\" id=\"a_227\">Rameshwar\n      v.

Partisanship by itself is not a valid\n    ground for discrediting or discarding sole testimony. We may\n    fruitfully reproduce a passage from the said authority: (SCC\n    pp. 683-84, para 13)\n       &quot;13. ... an invariable rule that interested evidence can\n       never form the basis of conviction unless corroborated to\n       a material extent in material particulars by independent\n       evidence.

If on such scrutiny,\n       the interested testimony is found to be intrinsically\n       reliable or inherently probable, it may, by itself, be\n       sufficient, in the circumstances of the particular case, to\n       base a conviction thereon.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_259\">    26.

We are unable to agree with the learned Judges of\n        the High Court that the testimony of the two\n        eyewitnesses requires corroboration. If the foundation for\n        such an observation is based on the fact that the\n        witnesses are women and that the fate of seven men\n        hangs on their testimony, we know of no such rule. If it is\n        grounded on the reason that they are closely related to\n        the deceased we are unable to concur. This is a fallacy\n        common to many criminal cases and one which another\n        Bench of this Court endeavoured to dispel in --\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_270\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1420504\" id=\"span_260\"><a href=\"/doc/1420504/\" id=\"a_248\">&#x27;Rameshwar v.

Why a &quot;related witness&quot; would spare the real culprit in order to\nfalsely implicate some innocent person? There is a difference between\n&quot;related witness&quot; and &quot;interested witness&quot;. &quot;Interested witness&quot; is a\nwitness who is vitally interested in conviction of a person due to previous\nenmity. The &quot;Interested witness&quot; has been defined by the Supreme Court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_265\">                                     114</span>\n\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/50715141/\" id=\"a_252\">Mohd.

As regards the contention that all the eyewitnesses are close\n     relatives of the deceased, it is by now well-settled that a related\n     witness cannot be said to be an &quot;interested&quot; witness merely by\n     virtue of being a relative of the victim. This Court has\n     elucidated the difference between &quot;interested&quot; and &quot;related&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_274\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"151465151\" id=\"span_266\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18869096\" id=\"span_267\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1064706\" id=\"span_268\">witnesses in a plethora of cases, stating that a witness may be\n     called interested only when he or she derives some benefit\n     from the result of a litigation, which in the context of a\n     criminal case would mean that the witness has a direct or\n     indirect interest in seeing the accused punished due to prior\n     enmity or other reasons, and thus has a motive to falsely\n     implicate the accused (for instance, see <a href=\"/doc/1064706/\" id=\"a_253\">State of Rajasthan v.\n     Kalki</a>; <a href=\"/doc/18869096/\" id=\"a_254\">Amit v.

State of T.N.</a>, in the following terms, by referring\n     to the three-Judge Bench decision in <a href=\"/doc/1064706/\" id=\"a_257\">State of Rajasthan v.\n     Kalki</a>: (<a href=\"/doc/194973728/\" id=\"a_258\">Ganapathi</a> case, SCC p. 555, para 14)\n        &quot;14. &quot;Related&quot; is not equivalent to &quot;interested&quot;. A\n        witness may be called &quot;interested&quot; only when he or she\n        derives some benefit from the result of a litigation; in the\n        decree in a civil case, or in seeing an accused person\n        punished.

In criminal cases, it is often the case that the offence is\n     witnessed by a close relative of the victim, whose presence on\n     the scene of the offence would be natural. The evidence of\n     such a witness cannot automatically be discarded by labelling\n     the witness as interested. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"770422\" id=\"span_272\">Indeed, one of the earliest statements\n     with respect to interested witnesses in criminal cases was made\n     by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/770422/\" id=\"a_259\">Dalip Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, wherein this\n     Court observed: (AIR p. 366, para 26)\n        &quot;26. A witness is normally to be considered independent\n        unless he or she springs from sources which are likely to\n        be tainted and that usually means unless the witness has\n        cause, such as enmity against the accused, to wish to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_273\">                                      115</span>\n\n        implicate him falsely. Ordinarily a close relative would\n        be the last to screen the real culprit and falsely implicate\n        an innocent person.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_276\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1672414\" id=\"span_274\">15. In case of a related witness, the Court may not treat his or\n     her testimony as inherently tainted, and needs to ensure only\n     that the evidence is inherently reliable, probable, cogent and\n     consistent. We may refer to the observations of this Court in\n     <a href=\"/doc/1672414/\" id=\"a_260\">Jayabalan v. State (UT of Pondicherry</a>): (SCC p. 213, para 23)\n        &quot;23. We are of the considered view that in cases where\n        the court is called upon to deal with the evidence of the\n        interested witnesses, the approach of the court, while\n        appreciating the evidence of such witnesses must not be\n        pedantic. The court must be cautious in appreciating and\n        accepting the evidence given by the interested witnesses\n        but the court must not be suspicious of such evidence.\n        The primary endeavour of the court must be to look for\n        consistency. The evidence of a witness cannot be ignored\n        or thrown out solely because it comes from the mouth of\n        a person who is closely related to the victim.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_277\">137. Since, Hariom (P.W.6) is a related witness and old enmity between\nthe complainant and accused party is writ large, therefore, this Court\nwould appreciate the evidence of Hariom (P.W.6) very minutely and\nwould also look for corroboration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_278\">138. Hariom (P.W.6) has identified Cheeku @ Sohan Singh,\nGhanshyam, Dinesh Jat, Rustam Singh, Mohar Singh, Balli Yadav,\nKaptan Singh, Bablu Yadav, Mahendra, Sitaram and Amar Singh in the\ndock. He has stated that on 16-7-2006, at about 8:30 P.M., he was\nstanding near Bajrag Grocery Shop, Pinto Park. Firing took place. Firing\nwas aimed at Sughar Singh who was sitting on the front passenger seat of\nthe Safari car. The said Safari car was being driven by Jagdish. Yuvraj\n(P.W1) was also sitting in the same vehicle. Mohar Singh, Rustam,\nCheeku, Balli, Kallu @ Kalyan Yadav, Ballu Yadav, Dinesh Yadav,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_275\">                                     116</span>\n\nKaptan and absconding accused Autar were firing gun shots.                He\nthereafter clarified that even Dinesh Yadav is also absconding. Mohar\nSingh was having .12 bore gun, Kaptan was having .12 bore gun,\nCheeku, Rustam Singh, Kalli, Bablu Yadav were having .315 bore rifles.\nKallu @ Kalyan, Autar were having .315 bore gun whereas Dinesh Yadav\nwas having .12 bore gun. He also clarified that Sitaram, Mahendra,\nGhanshyam, and Amar Singh were not on spot. Accused Dinesh Jat was\ndriving Scorpio vehicle. Apart from Rustam Singh who was sitting on\nthe front passenger seat of Safari, Jagdish, the driver and Yuvraj (P.W.1)\nwho were inside the Safari Car, Sintu who was purchasing medicine also\nsustained gun shot injuries. Mukesh and Umesh also reached on the spot.\nAfter the assailants left the place of incident, he went nearer to the Safari\ncar and by that time, Umesh and Mukesh had also reached there. Yuvraj\n(P.W.1) who was groaning in pain was taken out from the vehicle.\nUmesh and Mukesh took him to hospital on a motor cycle. By that time,\nJaiveer, and Narendra also reached on the spot. This witness and Jaiveer\nand Narendra took Sughar Singh to Sahara hospital, where he was\ndeclared dead, and then, Sughar Singh was taken to J.A. Hospital, where\ntoo he was declared dead. Thereafter, he came back to his house along\nwith his cousin brother Mahendra. At about 1:00 A.M., in the night, the\nTown Inspector Muneesh Rajoria (P.W.18) came to his house and\naccordingly, Dehati Nalishi, Ex. P.8 was lodged. Thereafter, he was told\nthat spot map, Ex. P.9 has already been prepared, and thus, this witness\nmay verify the same and accordingly, he went to spot at about 1:30-1:45\nP.M. and saw the spot map, Ex. P.9. On a query by the Court, he stated\nthat Bajrang Grocery shop was opened at the time of incident and 5-6\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_276\">                                    117</span>\n\ncustomers were purchasing articles. He had also gone there to purchase\ngoods. Safari car was coming from the side of Pinto Park Triangle. Only\nafter hearing the noise of gun shot firing, he saw the Safari car. Prior to\nthat he had no attention towards the Safari Car, Scorpio car (vehicle of\nthe accused), accused and injured. This witness was cross-examined.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_279\">139. He stated that his house is at a distance of 1 Km from the spot.\nRamveer, this witness and the deceased Sughar Singh are real brothers.\nMahesh who took Yuvraj (P.W.1) to hospital is the son of his sister\nMithya Devi. Matrimonial house of Mithya Devi is in village Barotha,\nwhich is approximately 45 Kms. away from the spot.            Rajaram had\nlodged a FIR on 15-5-2000 against Sughar Singh, Jaiveer and two other\npersons for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_261\">Section 302</a> of IPC. He admitted that as per\nsaid FIR, Vidhyaram was killed. Vidhyaram was killed on the date of\nelection for the post of Councilor. Thereafter, he clarified that the murder\ntook place after the voting. Jaiveer is his cousin brother. A question was\nput to this witness that on the date of incident, Criminal Revision against\nthe acquittal of Sughar Singh was pending or not, but he replied, he has\nno information about that, but Sughar Singh was acquitted. He admitted\nthat Jaiveer is still lodged in jail in connection with said offence. A\nquestion was put to this witness as to whether any report was lodged by\nRajaram against this witness that he was pressurizing the witnesses not to\ndepose, then he clarified that Rajaram was returning after attending one\nbirthday party and was under the influence of alcohol and had collided\nwith the tractor as a result he sustained injuries and on the next day, he\nlodged a false report against him. He admitted that he and Jaiveer were\nconvicted and were sentenced for 6 months. But clarified that they were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_277\">                                     118</span>\n\nacquitted in appeal. He admitted that he is a property broker and Sughar\nSingh was also in business of sale and purchase of property. He admitted\nthat Rustam Singh after firing at Sughar Singh on 4-11-2004, had shifted\nfrom Pinto Park. On 4-11-2004, Sughar Singh was going to fill up his\nnomination paper and at that time, the said incident had taken place. The\nmurder of Sughar Singh took place on a public road. He expressed his\nignorance as to where Sughar Singh had gone and from where he was\nreturning back.    He denied that at the time of incident, he was not\nstanding near Bajrang Grocery shop. Yuvraj (P.W.1) is known to him\nsince his childhood. Since, he had stated in his Dehati Nalishi, Ex. P.8\nthat Yuvraj (P.W.1) was taken to Sahara Hospital by Umesh and Mukesh,\ntherefore, he did not think it proper to specifically say that Yuvraj (P.W.1)\nwas also sitting in the Safari car. He denied that Mukesh and Umesh\nwere not on the spot. He denied that Yuvraj (P.W.1) was not taken to the\nhospital by Mukesh and Umesh but he was taken by his brother\nParmanand. He stated that although there was an old enmity but he had\ngone to purchase goods. He disowned his part of statement, Ex. D. 10, in\nwhich he had stated that because of old enmity, he had gone towards\nPinto Park. He admitted that front side of the vehicle of Sughar Singh\nwas facing Pinto Park and rear side was towards Bhind road.               He\nadmitted that his face was towards grocery shop, but denied that his back\nwas towards the accused but claimed that they were facing each other.\nHe denied that gun shots were fired from the rear side of the Safari car.\nHe stated that gun shots were fired from front and driver side of the\nSafari Car. He disowned his part of statement, Ex. D.10 in which he had\nstated that gun shots were fired from the rear side of car. He admitted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_278\">                                     119</span>\n\nthat he has engaged Shri Pankaj Saxena, Advocate. The accused persons\nhad not surrounded the Safari car from all the sides. Since, gun shots\nwere being fired indiscriminately from two sides, therefore, it can also be\ndescribed as surrounding the vehicle. He was not in a position to clarify\nthat which gun shot fired by which person had caused injury to which\ndeceased or injured. He admitted that Birla Hospital is at a distance of 5-\n7 minutes, but clarified that since, MLC is not done in the said hospital,\ntherefore, they took Sughar Singh to Sahara Hospital. His intentions\nwere to save Sughar Singh. While going back from J.A. Hospital, an\nidea did not occur to him that police be informed. He denied that since,\nhe was not aware of the names of the assailants, therefore, he did not\ninform the police while coming back from J.A. Hospital. He denied that\nthe incident did not take place at 8:30 P.M. He denied that unknown\npersons had fired at Sughar Singh, Jagdish, Sintu and Yuvraj. He denied\nthat Mohar Singh had gone to Indore by Intercity Train. He admitted that\nearlier an offence was registered against him and Sughar Singh on the\nallegation of firing at Kaptan Singh. Except the election rivalry, he had\nno other enmity.     He admitted that Sughar Singh had contested the\nelection as a candidate of B.J.P. and at the time of incident, B.J.P. was the\nruling party. After the death of Sughar Singh, this witness also contested\nthe election of Councilor as a B.J.P. candidate and had won the election.\nHe admitted that various Ministers and leaders of B.J.P. had visited his\nhouse. He could not explain as to why the fact of going to the shop of\nBajrang for purchasing grocery is not mentioned in his Dehati Nalishi,\nEx. P.8 and police statement, Ex. D.10. But also clarified that he donot\nrecollect as to whether he had disclosed to the police or not? He also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_279\">                                    120</span>\n\ncould not explain as to why the fact that he went to the Safari car and\nUmesh and Mukesh also reached there is not mentioned in his Dehati\nNalishi, Ex. P.8 and Police Statements Ex. D.10 and D.11. Police had not\nseized his blood stained cloths.     He also clarified that he doesnot\nrecollect as to whether he had informed the police that Narendra and\nJaiveer also came to the spot, and from there, they took Sughar Singh to\nhospital, but admitted that this fact is not mentioned in his Dehati\nNalishi, Ex. P.8 and police statements, Ex. D.10 and D.11. He took\nSughar Singh on his private maruti car which is registered in the name of\nhis cousin brother Jai Singh Yadav. He denied that Bhajju is his servant.\nHe admitted that while stating Dehati Nalishi, Ex. P.8 he had not\ninformed that Kaptan Singh, Bablu Yadav, Dinesh Yadav and Autar were\nalso firing, but clarified that he was informed by Umesh and Yuvraj\n(P.W.1) in this regard. Umesh had informed at 2:00 A.M. in the same\nnight. He claimed that he had disclosed the above mentioned names to\nthe police on 19-7-2006, but the police informed that they will record his\nsupplementary statement. He denied that Bablu and Kaptan were not on\nthe spot. He denied that since,he had not seen them, therefore, it is\nmentioned in the Dehati Nalishi, Ex. P.8 and Police Statement, Ex. D.10\nthat gun shots were fired by unknown persons. On a specific question\nput by the defence that in Dehati Nalishi, Ex. P.8, this witness had\nclaimed that 3-4 more persons came down from the car and also fired gun\nshots and similar police statement, Ex. D.10 was given by him, then he\nclarified that he had seen them from behind the car, therefore, only their\nheads were visible and their faces were not visible, thus, he had\ndescribed them as unknown person. He had seen the assailants while they\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_280\">                                   121</span>\n\nwere deboarding from Scorpio car and they also went away by the same\ncar. He admitted that he had not personally seen Autar, Bablu, Dinesh\nand Kaptan. He further stated that he was informed by Yuvraj (P.W.1) and\nUmesh (P.W.7) that Dinesh Jat was driving the Scorpio car, therefore, his\nname was not disclosed in Dehati Nalishi, Ex. P.8 and Police Statement,\nEx. D.10. He had seen that one more person was lying on the spot, but\nhe was not aware of his name and came to know about his name only\nafter he returned back from the hospital. Sintu was not known to him.\nHe has not seen the dead body Sintu also. He had gone to purchase\nC.F.L. Light, Soyabeen Barri, and Pears Soap. Before he could purchase\nthe goods, the incident took place. He denied that he had not gone to the\nshop of Bajrang. He also stated that Bablu, Kaptan, Rustam, Sitaram and\nKallu belongs to one family and are active members of Congress party,\ntherefore, there was an enmity.    He denied that Dinesh Jat was not\npresent on the spot and was admitted in District Hospital Datia. He\nadmitted that Balli has .315 bore gun but could not explain as to whether\nthe license is in the name of his brother Pancham or not?        He had\nelectoral enmity with Balli and there was a property dispute also. He had\ngone to Bajrang Shop on his private car and had parked near the Neem\ntree. There is an Electricity Transformer just opposite to the shop of\nBajrang. Neem tree is not shown in spot map, Ex. P.9. He had seen the\nincident from the counter of Bajrang shop. After the assailants ran away\nfrom the spot, he went to the spot. Spot map, Ex. 9 was not prepared in\nhis presence but it was shown to him immediately after the Dehati\nNalishi, Ex. P.8 was lodged. He did not object to the fact that why his\nname has been mentioned as an informant for preparation of spot map,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_281\">                                    122</span>\n\nEx. P.9, as he thought that it might be the part of investigation. He\ndenied that Sughar Singh was not taken out of the Safari car. He denied\nthat Sughar Singh was lying on the ground in a dead condition. He stated\nthat after taking out from the Safari Car, Sughar Singh was kept on the\nground as a result lot of blood had accumulated there. He had informed\nMuneesh Rajoria (P.W.18) the place from where he had witnessed the\nincident. There is no tree in between Bajrang Grocery Shop and the\nplace of incident. There is a Jamun tree in between Aarti Clinic and the\nspot and said tree is still there. It is true that Jamun tree is in front of\nAarti Clinic and the Safari car had stopped in front of Sakhshi Medical\nshop and Yadav Clinic and some part of the Safari car was in front of\nAarti Clinic. Shops have been rightly shown in the spot map, Ex. P.9.\nThe assailants were standing at place G and H shown in the spot map,\nEx. P.9. Scorpio vehicle was parked at the junction of C.P. Industry road.\nThe accused persons had deboarded from the Scorpio vehicle and\nthereafter, the said vehicle had stopped at the junction of C.P. Industry\nroad. Scorpio vehicle had not stopped by the side of Safari car. The\nScorpio vehicle was ultimately parked about 35 ft.s away from the Safari\ncar. First of all, Mohar Singh came down from the Scorpio vehicle and\ntwo persons had deboarded in the last. Since, they were on the western\nside of the Scorpio vehicle, therefore, he could not see their faces. He\nfurther stated that street poles are there on the spot. He clarified that\ninvestigating officer Muneesh Rajoria (P.W.18) had told him that\nphotographs of the site have been taken and the street light is visible in\nthat.   Police Statement, Ex. D.10 was written immediately after the\nDehati Nalishi, Ex. P. 8 was written. He had parked his car on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_282\">                                       123</span>\n\nsouthern side of shop no. 16.

The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/9772479/\" id=\"a_263\">Jagdish Narain v. State of U.P.</a>,\nreported in (1996) 8 SCC 199 has held as under :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">        9. In responding to the next criticism of the trial court\n        regarding the failure of the Investigating Officer to indicate in\n        the site plan prepared by him the spot where from the shots\n        were allegedly fired by the appellants and its resultant effect\n        upon the investigation itself, the High Court observed that such\n        failure did not detract from the truthfulness of the eyewitnesses\n        and only amounted to an omission on the part of the\n        Investigating Officer. In our opinion neither the criticism of the\n        trial court nor the reason ascribed by the High Court in its\n        rebuttal can be legally sustained. While preparing a site plan an\n        Investigating Police Officer can certainly record what he sees\n        and observes, for that will be direct and substantive evidence\n        being based on his personal knowledge; but as, he was not\n        obviously present when the incident took place, he has to\n        derive knowledge as to when, where and how it happened from\n        persons who had seen the incident. When a witness testifies\n        about what he heard from somebody else it is ordinarily not\n        admissible in evidence being hearsay, but if the person from\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_284\">                              124</span>\n\nwhom he heard is examined to give direct evidence within the\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/1681167/\" id=\"a_264\">Section 60</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 the former&#x27;s\nevidence would be admissible to corroborate the latter in\naccordance with <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_265\">Section 157</a> CrPC (sic <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_266\">Evidence Act</a>).\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_284\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"259353\" id=\"span_285\">However such a statement made to a police officer, when he is\ninvestigating into an offence in accordance with Chapter XII of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_267\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> cannot be used to even\ncorroborate the maker thereof in view of the embargo in\n<a href=\"/doc/1153129/\" id=\"a_268\">Section 162(1)</a> CrPC appearing in that chapter and can be used\nonly to contradict him (the maker) in accordance with the\nproviso thereof, except in those cases where sub-section (2) of\nthe section applies. That necessarily means that if in the site\nplan PW 6 had even shown the place from which the shots\nwere allegedly fired after ascertaining the same from the\neyewitnesses it could not have been admitted in evidence being\nhit by <a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_269\">Section 162</a> CrPC. The law on this subject has been\nsuccinctly <a href=\"/doc/9772479/\" id=\"a_270\">laid down by</a> a three-Judge Bench of this Court in\n<a href=\"/doc/259353/\" id=\"a_271\">Tori Singh v. State of U.P. In</a> that case it was contended on\nbehalf of the appellant therein that if one looked at the sketch\nmap, on which the place where the deceased was said to have\nbeen hit was marked, and compared it with the statements of\nthe prosecution witnesses and the medical evidence, it would\nbe extremely improbable for the injury which was received by\nthe deceased to have been caused on that part of the body\nwhere it had been actually caused if the deceased was at the\nplace marked on the map. In repelling the above contention this\nCourt observed, inter alia:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">   &quot;... the mark on the sketch-map was put by the Sub-\n   Inspector who was obviously not an eyewitness to the\n   incident. He could only have put it there after taking the\n   statements of the eyewitnesses. The marking of the spot\n   on the sketch-map is really bringing on record the\n   conclusion of the Sub-Inspector on the basis of the\n   statements made by the witnesses to him. This in our\n   opinion would not be admissible in view of the\n   provisions of <a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_272\">Section 162</a> of the Code of Criminal\n   Procedure, for it is in effect nothing more than the\n   statement of the Sub-Inspector that the eyewitnesses told\n   him that the deceased was at such and such place at the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_286\">                                     125</span>\n\n        time when he was hit. The sketch-map would be\n        admissible so far as it indicates all that the Sub-\n        Inspector saw himself at the spot; but any mark put on\n        the sketch-map based on the statements made by the\n        witnesses to the Sub-Inspector would be inadmissible in\n        view of the clear provisions of <a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_273\">Section 162</a> of the Code\n        of Criminal Procedure as it will be no more than a\n        statement made to the police during investigation.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_285\">                                               (emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_286\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"259353\" id=\"span_287\">10. While on this point, it will be pertinent to mention that if in\n     a given case the site plan is prepared by a draftsman -- and not\n     by the Investigating Officer -- entries therein regarding the\n     place from where shots were fired or other details derived from\n     other witnesses would be admissible as corroborative evidence\n     as has been observed by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/259353/\" id=\"a_274\">Tori Singh</a> case in the\n     following passage:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"819576\" id=\"span_288\">&quot;This Court had occasion to consider the admissibility of\n        a plan drawn to scale by a draftsman in which after\n        ascertaining from the witnesses where exactly the\n        assailants and the victims stood at the time of the\n        commission of offence, the draftsman put down the\n        places in the map, in <a href=\"/doc/819576/\" id=\"a_275\">Santa Singh v. State of Punjab</a>. It\n        was held that such a plan drawn to scale was admissible\n        if the witnesses corroborated the statement of the\n        draftsman that they showed him the places and would\n        not be hit by <a href=\"/doc/523607/\" id=\"a_276\">Section 162</a> of the Code of Criminal\n        Procedure.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_287\">                                               (emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_288\">144. Thus, it is clear that this witness had not personally seen Autar,\nBablu, Dinesh Yadav, Kaptan and Dinesh Jat at the place of incident and\nhas stated on the basis of information given by Yuvraj (P.W.1) and Umesh\n(P.W.7). From the Dehati Nalishi, Ex. P.8, it is clear that he personally\nsaw Rustam, Mohar Singh, Kallu, Cheeku @ Sohan Singh, Balli, and\nalso saw 3-4 more persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_289\">145. Yuvraj (P.W.1) has specifically named Autar, Kaptan, Rustam,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_289\">                                  126</span>\n\nMohar Singh, Cheeku, Ballu @ Bablu, Balli, Dinesh Yadav, Dinesh Jat.\nTherefore, the evidence of Hariom (P.W.6) in respect of Ballu @ Bablu,\nDinesh Jat, Dinesh Yadav, Kaptan and Autar Singh is corroborated by the\nevidence of Yuvraj (P.W.1).   Thus, the evidence of Hariom (P.W.6) is\ntrustworthy and can be relied upon to the extent it is corroborated by\nother evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_290\">c. Whether Bhajju (P.W.4) is a reliable witness\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_291\">146. Bhajju (P.W.4) is a witness of conspiracy. He has stated that he\nwas working with Appellant Mohar Singh for the last 2 years. It was\n3:00 P.M. Ghanshyam instructed him to leave him at Dharamkanta\n(Weighing booth) of Mohar Singh. Accordingly he took him to\nDharamkanta. Mohar Singh was standing there. Thereafter, they were\ncalled inside the room. Sitaram, Mahendra, Maharaj Singh, Amar Singh,\nDinesh, Balli, Rustam, Bablu, Kalyan and Dinesh Jat were standing and\nCheeku was also sitting in the room. The accused persons were making\nplans for killing Sughar Singh and decided that Sughar Singh shall be\nkilled by the next morning. Thereafter, all the accused persons went\naway. Sitaram told him to stay back. At 9:00 P.M. he came back to the\nhouse of Mohar Singh and then he came to know that three persons have\nbeen killed. About 1-1 ½ hours thereafter, police had come, but he went\nin hiding. For next 8 days, he was roaming around from here and there.\nThereafter, Hariom (P.W.6) called him and then he narrated the entire\nincident of conspiracy to the police. Thus, this witness has claimed to\nhave seen the conspiracy. However, the Trial Court has disbelieved this\nwitness. Even the Counsel for the complainant could not satisfy this\nCourt as to why Bhajju (P.W.4) maintained silence for 8-9 days and how\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_290\">                                    127</span>\n\nHariom (P.W.6) came to know that Bhajju (P.W.4) had witnessed the\nconspiracy. After going through the evidence of Bhajju (P.W.4), this\nCourt is satisfied that there is no explanation for delayed disclosure of\nconspiracy by this witness and there is nothing on record to show that\nhow Hariom (P.W.6) came to know that Bhajju (P.W.4) had witnessed the\nconspiracy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_292\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"562199\" id=\"span_291\">147. It is true that mere delay in recording of statement under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_277\">Section\n161</a> of Cr.P.C., by itself would not make the evidence of such witness\nvulnerable, and can be relied upon provided delay is properly explained.\nThe Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/562199/\" id=\"a_278\">John Pandian v. State</a>, reported in\n(2010) 14 SCC 129 has held as under :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">     44........It is true that the criminal courts would expect the\n     statements of the eyewitnesses to be recorded immediately or\n     with least possible delay. The early recording of the statement\n     gives credibility to the evidence of such witnesses. But then it\n     is not an absolute rule of appreciation that where the statement\n     is recorded late, the witness is a false witness or a trumped-up\n     witness. That will depend upon the quality of the evidence of\n     the witness.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">148. If the evidence of Bhajju (P.W.4) and his explanation for not\ndisclosing the fact of conspiracy to anybody is considered, then it is clear\nthat on several occasions, this witness had come in close proximity with\npolice, but still he did not disclose anything to anybody, and all of a\nsudden, he was called by Hariom (P.W.6) and only then he narrated the\nincident to Police. Even Hariom (P.W.6) has not clarified that from\nwhom he came to know that Bhajju (P.W.4) is a witness of conspiracy.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_293\">Thus, the Trial Court has rightly disbelieved this witness.\nd. Whether Umesh Yadav (P.W.7) is a reliable witness\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_294\">149. The Trial Court has disbelieved Umesh Yadav (P.W.7) mainly on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_292\">                                   128</span>\n\nthe ground that in the Dehati Nalishi, Ex. P.8, in police statement, Ex.\nD.10 of Hariom (P.W.6) and in evidence of Muneesh Rajoria (P.W.18),\nthe presence of Umesh (P.W.7) is not mentioned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_295\">150. Now the question for consideration is that whether non-mention of\nname of Umesh in Dehati Nalishi, Ex. P.8 would make him unreliable?\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_296\">151. It is well established principle of law that names of all the\nwitnesses are not required to be mentioned in the FIR.

To begin with, this is\n     essentially a question of fact which was fully noticed by the\n     two courts of fact and in spite of that the courts of fact have\n     believed the evidence of PW 22 Rattan Singh. Secondly, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_297\">                                   129</span>\n\n     mere fact that his name was not given in the FIR, though of\n     some relevance, would not be sufficient by itself to entail\n     rejection of the testimony of this witness. We must realise that\n     five persons had been killed and the informant Sadhu Ram\n     must have been stunned and stupefied at the ghastly murders\n     that took place in his presence and had picked up sufficient\n     courage to run to the Police Station to lodge the FIR. It may be\n     that in view of that agitated mental condition he may have\n     omitted to mention the name of Rattan Singh. The mere fact\n     that Rattan Singh s/o Siri, Ram is not mentioned in the FIR\n     does not establish that Rattan Singh PW 22 could not have\n     seen the occurrence. It is possible that both these persons may\n     have witnessed the occurrence and the informant mentioned\n     the name of one and not the other. Other comments were also\n     made against Rattan Singh which have been considered by\n     both the trial court and the High Court. Both the courts have\n     held that the evidence of this witness inspires confidence.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_300\">     Strong reliance was placed on the conduct of the witness in not\n     reporting to the police officer immediately when he came to\n     the spot. The witness was, according to the findings of the\n     Sessions Judge and the High Court, an independent one and\n     was not at all connected with the litigations between the\n     appellants and the deceased. He, therefore, must have\n     disclosed the version before the police only when he was asked\n     to do so, because he had no interest in the matter at all. For\n     these reasons, we do not see any reason to take a view different\n     from the one taken by the Courts below regarding the\n     credibility of this witness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_301\">                                                (Underline supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_302\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1008043\" id=\"span_298\">154.

Though there was a reference that Dilip (A-1) was\n    accompanying three other associates, the witness was specific\n    in asserting that from the spot of occurrence he did not go\n    directly to the dispensary but went to the police station first.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_306\">    27. The further significant thing about the FIR is that there is\n    no reference to the death of Abhayraj who had also lost his life.\n    It is slightly unusual that though this witness as per his\n    admission knew Abhayraj, there is no reference to the name of\n    Abhayraj in the FIR. Shri Gaurav Agrawal, learned counsel\n    tried to take advantage of this and pointed out that the name of\n    Manoj (A-3) was not to be found in the FIR and that advantage\n    must go to Manoj on that account. It is also seen that the\n    witness had also failed to speak about the body of Abhayraj. In\n    our opinion, though the omission of names of Manoj and Sunil\n    is significant, much importance cannot be given to this\n    omission. The FIR was after all given by a person who had\n    seen the body of his young son having been brutally murdered.\n    He had also seen the dead body of his brother-in-law and had\n    also come to know that the other three members of the family\n    of Krishnan were also seriously injured in the incident. The\n    witness is bound to be excited and some scope would have to\n    be given to the mental state of the witness at that time. The\n    significance of this omission will be considered when we\n    individually consider the case of each accused.

In the present case, the Court must not lose sight of the fact that\nindiscriminate firing was done and more than 16 gun shot marks were\nfound on the Safari Car, whereas multiple gun shots were sustained by\nthe deceased persons and injured Yuvraj (P.W.1). The deceased Sughar\nSingh was a sitting councilor. The manner in which the offence was\ncommitted must have certainly sent a wave of panic in the society. Three\npersons lost their lives and one person was seriously injured. Hariom\n(P.W.6) is the real brother of deceased Sughar Singh. Multiple gun shot\ninjuries were found on the dead body of Sughar Singh and some of them\nwere caused from a very-very close range. Lot of persons must be\nvisiting the house of Hariom (P.W.6). Hariom (P.W.6) had taken his\nbrother Sughar Singh to Sahara Hospital and thereafter to J.A. Hospital.\nHis mental condition can be presumed. The Dehati Nalishi, Ex.

Thus, a witness cannot be disbelieved merely on the ground that\nhis name is not mentioned in the FIR or police statement, Ex. D.10.\nFurther more, the witnesses had witnessed the incident from different\nplaces. While lodging FIR, the witness was expected to disclose the\nmanner in which offence was committed and only that much of\ninformation was crucial. Who shifted the injured to the hospital was not\nan important information and if such a minute detail was not mentioned\nin the FIR, then the witness cannot be disbelieved.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_313\">161. Similarly, Muneesh Rajoria (P.W.18) has not stated that he had\nmade any arrangement of sending Yuvraj (P.W.1) to hospital. Under\nthese circumstances, Umesh (P.W.7) cannot be disbelieved. Hence, he\nwas wrongly disbelieved by the Trial Court.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_307\">                                    133</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_314\">162. Umesh (P.W.7) has stated that on 16-7-2007 he was working in\nHina Bread Factory.     He was returning back from factory and was\nstanding under the tree and was talking to Mukesh. In the halogen street\nlight, he saw the Safari car of his maternal uncle Sughar Singh. Autar\nand Kaptan Singh who were carrying .12 bore and .315 bore guns were\nmoving ahead on their motor cycle. When Safari Car gave a horn for\nside, then Kaptan Singh gave a signal for turning. At that time, one\ncream coloured Scorpio car came from behind and Rustam Singh was\nsitting on the front passenger seat. As soon as the Scorpio car came by\nthe side of Safari Car, Rustam Singh fired a gun shot causing injury to\nthe driver of the Safari Car. Thereafter, Mohar Singh, Cheeku, Kallu,\nBalli, Dinesh Yadav, and Bablu came down from the Scorpio car. Mohar\nSingh was having his gun, Kallu was having .315 bore gun, Balli, Bablu\nand Dinesh Yadav were also having .315 bore guns. Thereafter, Mohar\nSingh, Cheeku, Balli, Rustam, Kallu started firing at the vehicle from its\nfront side. Dinesh Jat who was driving Scorpio, parked the vehicle after\nfew distance from Safari car. He and Mukesh took shelter behind the\ntree. He also saw Kaptan Singh, Autar, Dinesh Yadav and Bablu Yadav\nfiring gun shots from the side of vehicle also. Thereafter, they escaped\nfrom the spot on Scorpio car and motor cycle. After the assailants left the\nplace of incident, he and Mukesh went near to the Safari Car. Hariom\nalso reached there. Yuvraj (P.W.1) was groaning in the car. Sughar Singh\nwas lying in the car. Hariom instructed him to take Yuvraj to Sahara\nHospital and thereafter, he and Mukesh took Yuvraj (P.W.1) to Sahara\nHospital on their motorcycle.      Yuvraj (P.W.1) was admitted in the\nhospital. He further stated that he is residing in the house of Hariom.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_308\">                                    134</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_315\">This witness was cross-examined.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_316\">163. In cross-examination, he stated that although he is the resident of\nvillage Barotha, but he was staying in the house of Hariom (P.W.1) and\nwas using his motorcycle. Prahlad Tulani is the owner of Hina Bread\nFactory. He was serving in the factory for the last 6-7 months prior to the\ndate of incident. His shift was from 8:15 in the morning till 8:15 in the\nnight. He was Chowkidar in the factory. Mukesh is not related to him.\nThe entire incident took place within 1-1 ½ minute. He had seen the\naccused getting down from the Scorpio car. The driver of Scorpio car had\nparked the vehicle on the road which is in between Temple and Mishra\nGrocery Shop. He denied that he and Mukesh were not on the spot. He\ndenied that he is giving evidence after due deliberations. They had\nmerely shifted the injured Yuvraj (P.W.1) to the hospital. Parmanand, the\nbrother of Yuvraj (P.W.1) had also come and remaining formalities were\ncompleted by him. He had stayed in Sahara Hospital for 20-25 minutes\nand thereafter went to J.A. Hospital. He was informed by some persons\nthat Sughar Singh has been taken to J.A. Hospital, therefore, he went\nthere.   He stated that about 100-200 labourers work in Hina Bread\nFactory. Pawan Sharma and Ashok Sharma are two managers working in\nthe said factory. He took about 15 minutes to reach to Sahara Hospital.\nYuvraj (P.W.1) was taken by the Doctors inside the hospital, whereas he\nwas standing in the room. Parmanand reached there after 10-15 minutes.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_317\">164. This witness was cross-examined in detail, but nothing could be\nelicited from his evidence which may make his evidence unreliable. It is\nsubmitted that since, this witness is a close relative of the deceased,\ntherefore, he is an interested witness. The incident took place on the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_309\">                                    135</span>\n\npublic road, but no independent witness was examined by the Police.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_318\">165.

So far as non-examination of independent witnesses is concerned,\nit is suffice to mention here that now a days, independent witnesses are\nhesitant to come forward for various reasons. They are apprehensive of\npicking up enmity with the accused persons. They are apprehensive of\nappearing before the investigating officer and thereafter before the Court.\nFurther three persons were killed on the main road by indiscriminate\nfiring on a vehicle. The Appellants themselves have given suggestion to\nthe witnesses, that on the next day, the market was kept closed in protest.\nThe panic in the society can be inferred. When a situation is surcharged\nwith tension then it cannot be expected from an independent witness to\ncome forward and depose in the matter. The Supreme Court in the case\nof <a href=\"/doc/24680/\" id=\"a_289\">Mahesh v. State of Maharashtra</a>, reported in (2008) 13 SCC 271 has\nheld as under :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">     55. As regards non-examination of the independent witnesses\n     who probably witnessed the occurrence on the roadside, suffice\n     it to say that testimony of PW Sanjay, an eyewitness, who\n     received injuries in the occurrence, if found to be trustworthy\n     of belief, cannot be discarded merely for non-examination of\n     the independent witnesses. The High Court has held in its\n     judgment and, in our view, rightly that the reasons given by the\n     learned trial Judge for discarding and disbelieving the\n     testimony of PWs 4, 5, 6 and 8 were wholly unreasonable,\n     untenable and perverse. The occurrence of the incident, as\n     noticed earlier, is not in serious dispute. PW Prakash Deshkar\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_311\">                                   136</span>\n\n    has also admitted that he had lodged complaint to the police\n    about the incident on the basis of which FIR came to be\n    registered and this witness has supported in his deposition the\n    contents of the complaint to some extent. It is well settled that\n    in such cases many a times, independent witnesses do not come\n    forward to depose in favour of the prosecution. There are many\n    reasons that persons sometimes are not inclined to become\n    witnesses in the case for a variety of reasons. It is well settled\n    that merely because the witnesses examined by the prosecution\n    are relatives of the victim, that fact by itself will not be\n    sufficient to discard and discredit the evidence of the relative\n    witnesses, if otherwise they are found to be truthful witnesses\n    and rule of caution is that the evidence of the relative witnesses\n    has to be reliable evidence which has to be accepted after deep\n    and thorough scrutiny.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_321\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158741\" id=\"span_312\">168.

It was then submitted that in spite of the fact that a large\n    number of persons had assembled at the bank of the river at the\n    time of occurrence, the witnesses examined are only those who\n    are members of the family of the deceased or in some manner\n    connected with him. We cannot lose sight of the fact that four\n    of such witnesses are injured witnesses and, therefore, in the\n    absence of strong reasons, we cannot discard their testimony.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_322\">    The fact that they are related to the deceased is the reason why\n    they were attacked by the appellants. Moreover, in such\n    situations though many people may have seen the occurrence, it\n    may not be possible for the prosecution to examine each one of\n    them. In fact, there is evidence on record to suggest that when\n    the occurrence took place, people started running helter-skelter.\n    In such a situation it would be indeed difficult to find out the\n    other persons who had witnessed the occurrence. In any event,\n    we have the evidence of as many as 7 witnesses, 4 of them\n    injured, whose evidence has been found to be reliable by the\n    courts below, and we find no reason to take a different view.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_323\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"820169\" id=\"span_313\">169.

As far as the non-examination of any other independent\n     witness is concerned, there is no doubt that the prosecution has\n     not been able to produce any independent witness. But, the\n     prosecution case cannot be doubted on this ground alone. In\n     these days, civilised people are generally insensitive to come\n     forward to give any statement in respect of any criminal\n     offence. Unless it is inevitable, people normally keep away\n     from the court as they find it distressing and stressful. Though\n     this kind of human behaviour is indeed unfortunate, but it is a\n     normal phenomena. We cannot ignore this handicap of the\n     investigating agency in discharging their duty. We cannot derail\n     the entire case on the mere ground of absence of independent\n     witness as long as the evidence of the eyewitness, though\n     interested, is trustworthy.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_326\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"14302440\" id=\"span_316\">171.

It is not necessary that in each and every case on\n    the ground of non-examination of independent witnesses the\n    case of the prosecution has to be brushed aside; if the evidence\n    of prosecution witnesses is consistent, cogent and corroborated\n    by other evidence it can be safely relied upon, but it is not so in\n    the case at hand.......\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_327\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1584447\" id=\"span_318\">172. Further, the Counsel for the Appellants has relied upon the\njudgment passed by the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1584447/\" id=\"a_295\">Noor Aga Vs.\nState of Punjab</a> reported in (2008) 16 SCC 417 in which the Supreme\nCourt has held as under :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_125\">    110. It is accepted that when the appellant allegedly opted for\n    being searched by a Magistrate or a gazetted officer, Kuldip\n    Singh called K.K. Gupta, Superintendent, Customs (PW 2) and\n    independent witnesses Mohinder Singh and Yusaf. Whereas\n    K.K. Gupta was examined as PW 2, the said Mohinder Singh\n    and Yusaf were not examined by the prosecution. There is\n    nothing on record to show why they could not be produced.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_328\">    Their status in life or location had also not been stated. It is\n    also not known as to why only the said two witnesses were sent\n    for. The fact remains that they had not been examined.\n    Although examination of independent witnesses in all\n    situations may not be imperative, if they were material, in terms\n    of <a href=\"/doc/520370/\" id=\"a_296\">Section 114(e)</a> of the Evidence Act, an adverse inference\n    could be drawn.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_329\">    111. In a case of this nature, where there are a large number of\n    discrepancies, the appellant has been gravely prejudiced by\n    their non-examination. It is true that what matters is the quality\n    of the evidence and not the quantity thereof but in a case of\n    this nature where procedural safeguards were required to be\n    strictly complied with, it is for the prosecution to explain why\n    the material witnesses had not been examined. The matter\n    might have been different if the evidence of the investigating\n    officer who recovered the material objects was found to be\n    convincing. The statement of the investigating officer is wholly\n    unsubstantiated. There is nothing on record to show that the\n    said witnesses had turned hostile. Examination of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_319\">                                    139</span>\n\n    independent witnesses was all the more necessary inasmuch as\n    there exist a large number of discrepancies in the statement of\n    official witnesses in regard to search and seizure of which we\n    may now take note.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_330\">173. Thus, it is clear that non-examination of Independent witnesses\ncannot be said to be always fatal to the prosecution case and the facts and\ncircumstances of each and every case are to be considered. In the present\ncase, the independent witness Urmila did not appear inspite of service of\nbailable warrants. It is also not out of place to mention here that during\ntrial Rustam, Cheeku and Ghanshyam had jumped bail and thus, it is\nclear that there must be fear in the mind of the independent witnesses,\ntherefore, they did not appear. It is not a case, where no independent\nwitnesses were cited at all by the prosecution, but if the independent\nwitnesses are not ready to come before the Court for deposing in the\nmatter, then the entire prosecution case cannot be thrown overboard.\nWhen the prosecution evidence has been held to be reliable and\ntrustworthy, then such evidence cannot be rejected merely on the ground\nof non-examination of independent witnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_331\">174. It is further submitted by the Counsel of the Appellants that it is\nclaim of Umesh Yadav (P.W.7) that he and Mukesh had taken the injured\nYuvraj (P.W.1) to Sahara Hospital, whereas Parmanand (D.W.5) who is\nthe brother of Yuvraj (P.W.1) had taken him to the hospital, therefore, is\nclear that Umesh Yadav (P.W.7) was not on the spot.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_332\">175.

This Court has already come to a conclusion that after the\nexamination-in-chief and the cross-examination of Yuvraj (P.W.1) was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_320\">                                    140</span>\n\ncompleted, some thing transpired and accordingly, application was filed\nfor recall of Yuvraj (P.W.1). After he was recalled, he took a somersault\nand claimed that earlier examination-in-chief and cross-examination was\ngiven under the pressure of Hariom (P.W.6).            Subsequent, cross-\nexamination of Yuvraj (P.W.1) has already been rejected/disbelieved by\nthe Court. Since, Parmanand is the real brother of Yuvraj (P.W.1), then it\nis clear that he also must have been won over by the Appellants,\ntherefore, no much sanctity can be attached to the evidence of Parmanand\n(D.W.5), although the defence witness should also be appreciated like\nany other prosecution witness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_334\">177. Thus, we cannot disbelieve the prosecution evidence only on the\nground that independent witnesses were not examined.

The plea taken should\n    be capable of meaning that having regard to the time and place\n    when and where he is alleged to have committed the offence,\n    he could not have been present. The plea of alibi postulates the\n    physical impossibility of the presence of the accused at the\n    scene of offence by reason of his presence at another place.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_338\">    (See The Law Lexicon, P.

The plea of alibi in fact\n    is required to be proved with certainty so as to completely\n    exclude the possibility of the presence of the accused at the\n    place of occurrence and in the house which was the home of\n    their relatives.

On a consideration of the material before us, what strikes\n    us as a little odd is that insofar as Prem Chand and Raj Bala are\n    concerned, both the trial Judge and the High Court have given\n    us the impression that they proceeded on the basis that these\n    two accused persons are required to prove their innocence. In\n    fact it is for the prosecution to prove their guilt and that seems\n    to have been lost in the consideration of the case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">    20. It is no doubt true that when an alibi is set up, the burden is\n    on the accused to lend credence to the defence put up by him\n    or her. However, the approach of the court should not be such\n    as to pick holes in the case of the accused person.

We must bear in mind that an alibi is not an\n   exception (special or general) envisaged in the Penal\n   Code or any other law. It is only a rule of evidence\n   recognised in <a href=\"/doc/1067003/\" id=\"a_305\">Section 11</a> of the Evidence Act that facts\n   which are inconsistent with the fact in issue are relevant.&quot;\nIllustration (a) given under <a href=\"/doc/1067003/\" id=\"a_306\">Section 11</a> of the Evidence Act is\nthen partially reproduced in the decision, but it is fully\nreproduced below:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">   &quot;(a) The question is whether A committed a crime at\n   Calcutta on a certain day.

This Court then went on to say: (<a href=\"/doc/1460988/\" id=\"a_307\">Binay Kumar Singh</a> case,\nSCC p. 293, para 23)\n   &quot;23. The Latin word alibi means &#x27;elsewhere&#x27; and that word\n   is used for convenience when an accused takes recourse to a\n   defence line that when the occurrence took place he was so\n   far away from the place of occurrence that it is extremely\n   improbable that he would have participated in the crime. It\n   is a basic law that in a criminal case, in which the accused is\n   alleged to have inflicted physical injury to another person,\n   the burden is on the prosecution to prove that the accused\n   was present at the scene and has participated in the crime.\n   The burden would not be lessened by the mere fact that the\n   accused has adopted the defence of alibi. The plea of the\n   accused in such cases need be considered only when the\n   burden has been discharged by the prosecution satisfactorily.\n   But once the prosecution succeeds in discharging the burden\n   it is incumbent on the accused, who adopts the plea of alibi,\n   to prove it with absolute certainty so as to exclude the\n   possibility of his presence at the place of occurrence. When\n   the presence of the accused at the scene of occurrence has\n   been established satisfactorily by the prosecution through\n   reliable evidence, normally the court would be slow to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_333\">                                  144</span>\n\n       believe any counter-evidence to the effect that he was\n       elsewhere when the occurrence happened. But if the\n       evidence adduced by the accused is of such a quality and of\n       such a standard that the court may entertain some reasonable\n       doubt regarding his presence at the scene when the\n       occurrence took place, the accused would, no doubt, be\n       entitled to the benefit of that reasonable doubt. For that\n       purpose, it would be a sound proposition to be laid down\n       that, in such circumstances, the burden on the accused is\n       rather heavy.

He had also given his affidavit, Ex. D.16. This witness\nwas cross-examined. He claimed that he was a private employee of\nSociety. He could not give the details of office bearers of the society. He\ncould not produce any document to show that he was an employee of the\nsociety. He claimed that his monthly salary was Rs. 5,000/- and was also\nin possession of entire money of Society.

Although it is his evidence, that he had various money\ntransactions with Mohar Singh, but it is really surprising that when his\nmonthly salary was only Rs. 5,000/-, then how he can have various\nmoney transactions with Mohar Singh? Further, it is the case of this\nwitness, he had given Rs.10,000/- by misappropriating the money of the\nSociety, but he did not clarify that on what date, he returned the amount\nto the Society. He did not clarify that upto which date, he had worked in\nthe Society. It is also the case of the Appellant Mohar Singh that Naval\nSingh Sikarwar had left him at the Railway Station Gwalior. Then why\nMohar Singh was not carrying money with him ?\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_353\">                                    152</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_367\">199.

In\ncross-examination, he admitted that Dinesh Jat is not the resident of\nDatia.   He was also unable to disclose the address of Dinesh Jat.\nHowever, he claimed that Dinesh Jat was brought by Satish Shivhare.\nHowever, it is clear from the prescription, Ex D.37, there is no mention\nof name of Satish Shivhare.       Further more, initially date 17-7 was\nmentioned as 17-12 and thereafter, month &quot;12&quot; was scored out and it was\nmade &quot;7&quot;. How, Dr. G.L.

The\nmention of month &quot;12&quot; which was subsequently scored out in order to\nmake &quot;7&quot;, clearly shows that this prescription was not prepared in the\nmonth of July. Furthermore, this witness has admitted that an O.P.D.\nregister is maintained at the hospital level. However, the said OPD\nregister was not produced.

After having appreciated the evidence of certain crucial\n     witnesses, we would like to clarify at the outset that this is a\n     case of circumstantial evidence. Jurisprudentially the meaning\n     of circumstantial evidence has never been settled. Although we\n     may not require a detailed analysis of the jurisprudential\n     dichotomy which exists as to what amounts to &quot;circumstantial\n     evidence&quot;, we may indicate certain precedents and legal\n     literature have given a definite shape for the aforesaid term. In\n     Thomas Starkie: A Practical Treatise on the Law of Evidence,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_364\">                              157</span>\n\nand Digest of Proofs, in Civil and Criminal Proceedings (Vol.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_395\">I, 4th Edn., 1876), it is said that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">   &quot;In criminal cases, proof that the party-accused was\n   influenced by a strong motive of interest to commit the\n   offence proved to have been committed, although\n   exceedingly weak and inconclusive in itself, and\n   although it be a circumstance which ought never to\n   operate in proof of the corpus delicti, yet when that has\n   once been established aliunde, it is a circumstance to be\n   considered in conjunction with others which plainly tend\n   to implicate the accused.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_396\">33. Sir Fitz James Stephen, while writing his Introduction to\nIndian Evidence Act, 1872, writes as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">   Facts relevant to the issue are facts from the existence of\n   which inferences as to the existence of the facts in issue\n   may be drawn.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">   A fact is relevant to another fact when the existence of\n   the one can be shown to be the cause or one of the\n   causes, or the effect or one of the effects, of existence of\n   the other, or when the existence of the one, either alone\n   or together with other facts, renders the existence of the\n   other highly probable, or improbable, according to the\n   common course of events.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_397\">34. Wharton&#x27;s Criminal Evidence (1955):\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">   &quot;In prosecutions for homicide, as in criminal\n   prosecutions generally, evidence to show motive is\n   competent and considerable latitude is allowed in its\n   introduction.

It is well established that in cases where the evidence\n   is of a circumstantial nature, the circumstances from\n   which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should, in\n   the first instance, be fully established, and the\n   circumstances so established should be consistent only\n   with the hypothesis of the guilt of the accused person;\n   that is, the circumstances should be of such a nature as to\n   reasonably exclude every hypothesis but the one\n   proposed to be proved.

Circumstantial evidence are those facts, which the court\nmay infer further. There is a stark contrast between direct\nevidence and circumstantial evidence. In cases of\ncircumstantial evidence, the courts are called upon to make\ninferences from the available evidence, which may lead to the\naccused&#x27;s guilt. In majority of cases, the inference of guilt is\nusually drawn by establishing the case from its initiation to the\npoint of commission wherein each factual link is ultimately\nbased on evidence of a fact or an inference thereof. Therefore,\nthe courts have to identify the facts in the first place so as to fit\nthe case within the parameters of &quot;chain link theory&quot; and then\nsee whether the case is made out beyond reasonable doubt. In\nIndia we have for a long time followed the &quot;chain link theory&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"882637\" id=\"span_374\">since <a href=\"/doc/882637/\" id=\"a_346\">Hanumant</a> case, which of course needs to be followed\nherein also.</span>\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_375\">                                    160</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"13149785\" id=\"span_376\">224.

The present case is based on direct evidence of injured eye-witness\nYuvraj (P.W.1), eye-witness and complainant Hariom (P.W.6) and eye-\nwitness Umesh (P.W.7). Where direct ocular evidence is trustworthy,\nthen circumstantial evidence would merely corroborate the direct\nevidence. Under these circumstances, the recovery of weapons from\nRustam, Kaptan Singh, Cheeku @ Sohan Singh and Balli @ Balveer also\ncorroborates the direct evidence of Yuvraj (P.W.1), Hariom (P.W.6) and\nUmesh (P.W.7).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_411\">Whether some of the Appellants were over implicated by the\nwitnesses\nDelayed FIR\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_412\">226. It is submitted by the Counsel for the Appellants that the\ncomplainant party has implicated various accused persons as per their ill-\ndesigns. In Dehati Nalishi, Ex. P.8, Hariom (P.W.6) had named only 5\nassailants namely Rustam, Mohar Singh, Kallu, Cheeku @ Sohan Singh\nand Balli @ Balveer and alleged that 3-4 more persons were also there\nwho were firing gun shots. The names of Sitaram and Mahendra were\nmentioned as conspirators. Thereafter, in his police statement, Ex. D.10\nrecorded on 17-7-2006 itself, only same 5 persons were named and it was\nalso alleged that 3-4 persons were also firing.      Thereafter, Hariom\n(P.W.6) in his police statement, Ex. D.11 introduced Maharaj Singh,\nAmar Singh, Ghanshyam, Dinesh Jat, Dinesh Yadav, Kaptan Singh and\nAutar Singh also. Police Statement of Yuvraj (P.W.1) was recorded on\n17-7-2006, and names of Autar, Kaptan, Mohar Singh, Cheeku @ Sohan\nSingh, Kallu @ Kalyan, Bablu @ Ballu, Balli @ Balveer, Dinesh Jat,\nDinesh Yadav were also introduced apart from Rustam Singh who was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_379\">                                     162</span>\n\nalready named in his statement, Ex. D.4.     Thus, it is clear that since, the\ncomplainant party has developed the story falsely in order to implicate\ninnocent persons, therefore, it is clear that the prosecution witnesses are\nnot reliable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_413\">227.

The Latin Maxim Falsus in uno Falsus in omnibus has no\napplication in India. The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1486969/\" id=\"a_349\">Shakila Abdul\nGafar Khan v. Vasant Raghunath Dhoble</a>, reported in (2003) 7 SCC\n749 has held as under :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1183254\" id=\"span_381\">25. It is the duty of the court to separate the grain from the\n     chaff. Falsity of a particular material witness or a material\n     particular would not ruin it from the beginning to end. The\n     maxim &quot;falsus in uno falsus in omnibus&quot; has no application in\n     India and the witnesses cannot be branded as liars. The maxim\n     &quot;falsus in uno falsus in omnibus&quot; has not received general\n     acceptance nor has this maxim come to occupy the status of\n     rule of law. It is merely a rule of caution. All that it amounts to\n     is that in such cases testimony may be disregarded, and not that\n     it must be disregarded. The doctrine merely involves the\n     question of weight of evidence which a court may apply in a\n     given set of circumstances, but it is not what may be called &quot;a\n     mandatory rule of evidence&quot;. (See <a href=\"/doc/1183254/\" id=\"a_350\">Nisar Ali v. State of U.P</a>.)</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">     26. The doctrine is a dangerous one especially in India for if a\n     whole body of the testimony were to be rejected, because the\n     witness was evidently speaking an untruth in some aspect, it is\n     to be feared that administration of criminal justice would come\n     to a dead stop. Witnesses just cannot help in giving embroidery\n     to a story, however true in the main. Therefore, it has to be\n     appraised in each case as to what extent the evidence is worthy\n     of acceptance, and merely because in some respects the court\n     considers the same to be insufficient for placing reliance on the\n     testimony of a witness, it does not necessarily follow as a\n     matter of law that it must be disregarded in all respects as well.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_382\">                                    163</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_415\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"593857\" id=\"span_383\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1522035\" id=\"span_384\">The evidence has to be sifted with care. The aforesaid dictum is\n     not a sound rule for the reason that one hardly comes across a\n     witness whose evidence does not contain a grain of untruth or\n     at any rate an exaggeration, embroideries or embellishment.\n     (See <a href=\"/doc/1522035/\" id=\"a_351\">Sohrab v. State of M.P.</a> and <a href=\"/doc/593857/\" id=\"a_352\">Ugar Ahir v. State of Bihar</a>.)\n     An attempt has to be made to, as noted above, in terms of\n     felicitous metaphor, separate the grain from the chaff, truth\n     from falsehood. Where it is not feasible to separate the truth\n     from falsehood, because grain and chaff are inextricably mixed\n     up, and in the process of separation an absolutely new case has\n     to be reconstructed by divorcing essential details presented by\n     the prosecution completely from the context and the\n     background against which they are made, the only available\n     course to be made is to discard the evidence in toto.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1213298\" id=\"span_385\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"612149\" id=\"span_386\">(See\n     <a href=\"/doc/612149/\" id=\"a_353\">Zwinglee Ariel v.

Material\n     discrepancies are those which are not normal, and not expected\n     of a normal person.

It is submitted by the Counsel for the Appellants that it is clear that\nspot map, Ex. P.9 and seizure of articles from the spot vide seizure\nmemos, Ex.

Now the question\nfor consideration is that whether the preparation of spot map and seizure\nof cartridges, Safari Car, rifle from the Safari Car, seizure of blood\nstained seat covers of Safari car etc is bad in law or not?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_421\">233. Muneesh Rajoria (P.W.18) has stated that he received a telephonic\ninformation that firing is going on at Pinto Park and several persons have\nsustained injuries and accordingly after recording said information in\nRojnamchasanha No. 908 at 20:30, he rushed to the spot along with\npolice personals.    Thus, it is clear that the telephonic information\nreceived by Muneesh Rajoria (P.W.18) was cryptic one. However, one\nthing is clear that the police reached on the spot, after receiving an\ninformation of commission of cognizable offence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_422\">234. The incident had taken place on the public street, where number of\npersons had died and some had sustained injuries. Further more, the\ndeceased Sughar Singh was a sitting Councilor, therefore, the situation\non the spot can be presumed.

Under these circumstances, if the investigating officer\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_392\">                                     165</span>\n\nMuneesh Rajoria (P.W.18) decided to protect the spot by making seizure\nof fired cartridges, damaged Safari Car, Rifle which was lying inside the\nSafari Car, Live cartridges from the spot, etc. as well as to prepare the\nspot map, Ex.

The\npolice had already received an information and any thing done in order to\ncollect the evidence from the public street, then it would not nullify that\npart of the investigation.

No\n     limitation should be placed upon that power unless it be found\n     expressly stated in the Code, but in exercising the power\n     conferred by the Code and before reaching its conclusion upon\n     fact the High Court should give proper weight and\n     consideration to such matters as (1) the view of the trial Judge\n     as to the credibility of the witnesses; (2) the presumption of\n     innocence in favour of the accused a presumption certainly not\n     weakened by the fact that he has been acquitted at his trial; (3)\n     the right of the accused to the benefit of any real and\n     reasonable doubt; and (4) the slowness of an appellate court in\n     disturbing a finding of fact arrived at by a Judge who had the\n     advantage of seeing the witnesses.

To justify a conviction under this section it is not\n        essential that bodily injury capable of causing death\n        should have been inflicted.

Such an act may not be\n        attended by any result so far as the person assaulted is\n        concerned, but still there may be cases in which the\n        culprit would be liable under this section. It is not\n        necessary that the injury actually caused to the victim of\n        the assault should be sufficient under ordinary\n        circumstances to cause the death of the person assaulted.\n        What the Court has to see is whether the act, irrespective\n        of its result, was done with the intention or knowledge\n        and under circumstances mentioned in this section. An\n        attempt in order to be criminal need not be the\n        penultimate act.

It is not essential that bodily\n  injury capable of causing death should have been\n  inflicted. The section makes a distinction between the act\n  of the accused and its result, if any. The court has to see\n  whether the act, irrespective of its result, was done with\n  the intention or knowledge and under circumstances\n  mentioned in the section. Therefore, an accused charged\n  under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_398\">Section 307</a> IPC cannot be acquitted merely\n  because the injuries inflicted on the victim were in the\n  nature of a simple hurt.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_480\">                                         (emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_481\">12. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"20367\" id=\"span_434\">In <a href=\"/doc/20367/\" id=\"a_399\">Jage Ram v.

For the purpose of conviction under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_400\">Section 307</a>\n   IPC, the prosecution has to establish (i) the intention to\n   commit murder; and (ii) the act done by the accused. The\n   burden is on the prosecution that the accused had\n   attempted to commit the murder of the prosecution\n   witness. Whether the accused person intended to commit\n   murder of another person would depend upon the facts\n   and circumstances of each case. To justify a conviction\n   under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_401\">Section 307</a> IPC, it is not essential that fatal injury\n   capable of causing death should have been caused.\n   Although the nature of injury actually caused may be of\n   assistance in coming to a finding as to the intention of\n   the accused, such intention may also be adduced from\n   other circumstances. The intention of the accused is to be\n   gathered from the circumstances like the nature of the\n   weapon used, words used by the accused at the time of\n   the incident, motive of the accused, parts of the body\n   where the injury was caused and the nature of injury and\n   severity of the blows given, etc.&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_482\">13. The above judgments of this Court lead us to the\nconclusion that proof of grievous or life-threatening hurt is not\na sine qua non for the offence under Section 307 of the Penal\nCode. The intention of the accused can be ascertained from the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_435\">                                    181</span>\n\n    actual injury, if any, as well as from surrounding circumstances.\n    Among other things, the nature of the weapon used and the\n    severity of the blows inflicted can be considered to infer intent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_483\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"440197\" id=\"span_436\">272.

Section 307 relates to attempt to murder. It reads as\n    follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_173\">       &quot;307. Whoever does any act with such intention or\n       knowledge, and under such circumstances that, if he by\n       that act caused death, he would be guilty of murder, shall\n       be punished with imprisonment of either description for a\n       term which may extend to ten years, and shall also be\n       liable to fine; and if hurt is caused to any person by such\n       act, the offender shall be liable either to imprisonment for\n       life, or to such punishment as is hereinbefore\n       mentioned.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_484\">    12. To justify a conviction under this section, it is not essential\n    that bodily injury capable of causing death should have been\n    inflicted. Although the nature of injury actually caused may\n    often give considerable assistance in coming to a finding as to\n    the intention of the accused, such intention may also be\n    deduced from other circumstances, and may even, in some\n    cases, be ascertained without any reference at all to actual\n    wounds. The section makes a distinction between an act of the\n    accused and its result, if any. Such an act may not be attended\n    by any result so far as the person assaulted is concerned, but\n    still there may be cases in which the culprit would be liable\n    under this section. It is not necessary that the injury actually\n    caused to the victim of the assault should be sufficient under\n    ordinary circumstances to cause the death of the person\n    assaulted. What the court has to see is whether the act,\n    irrespective of its result, was done with the intention or\n    knowledge and under circumstances mentioned in the section.\n    An attempt in order to be criminal need not be the penultimate\n    act. It is sufficient in law, if there is present an intent coupled\n    with some overt act in execution thereof.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_437\">                                   182</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_485\">    13. It is sufficient to justify a conviction under Section 307 if\n    there is present an intent coupled with some overt act in\n    execution thereof.

Whether there was intention to kill or knowledge that death\n    will be caused is a question of fact and would depend on the\n    facts of a given case.

This Court as well as the Trial Court have come to a conclusion\nthat not only Fire arms were seized from the possession of Rustam Singh,\nCheeku @ Sohan Singh and Balli @ Balveer, but the injuries were\ncaused by fire arms only. Thus, the observation made by the Trial Court,\nthat although firearms were seized but the prosecution has not produced\nany convincing evidence is beyond reconciliation. Once the seizure of\nfirearms and their use is established, then nothing more was required to\nbe proved provided the sanction for prosecution was properly granted.\nThe Trial Court has not commented upon the sanction which was granted\nfor prosecution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_502\">278. R.K. Jain (P.W.9) had granted sanction for prosecution. He has\nstated that in the year 2006, he was posted as Additional District\nMagistrate.   The police had produced the case diary of crime no.\n339/2006 along with application for prosecution and arms and\nammunition. On .315 bore single barrel gun with one .315 bore cartridge\nwhich was seized from Rustam Singh, one .315 bore single barrel Adhiya\nwith one live cartridge, and two empty cartridges which were seized from\nCheeku @ Sohan Singh and one .315 bore single barrel gun which was\nseized from Balli @ Balveer were produced before him. After going\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_449\">                                    190</span>\n\nthrough the police case diary as well as the above mentioned weapons, he\nwas satisfied that the accused persons were in possession of the same\nwithout any license. Accordingly, sanction for prosecution, Ex P.11 was\ngranted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_503\">279. Thus, it is clear that the prosecution has examined the authority\nwhich had granted sanction for prosecution. Even during the course\narguments, the sanction for prosecution, Ex. P.11 was not challenged by\nthe Appellants. Thus, it is clear that sanction for prosecution was validly\ngranted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_504\">280. So far as the vagueness of the charges, as pointed out by the Trial\nCourt is concerned, the said observation is also not in accordance with\nlaw. None of the Appellant has claimed that the charge was vague or\nbecause of vagueness, any prejudice was caused to him. In the charges, it\nwas specifically mentioned that Rustam Singh, Balli @ Balveer and\nCheeku @ Sohan Singh were in possession of illegal firearms and were\nnot having any license and the said weapons were used for committing\noffence, therefore, their act is punishable under <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_439\">Section 25</a> and <a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_440\">27</a> of\nArms Act. In the considered opinion of this Court, there were sufficient\ningredients in the charges framed by the Trial Court to communicate to\nthe accused about the allegations on which they were to be tried. Further\nmore, in absence of any complaint with regard to any prejudice caused to\nthem, the Trial Court should not have held that since, any notification is\nnot mentioned, therefore, the charges were vague, specifically when it\nhas already come to a conclusion, that not only illegal firearms were\nseized from their possession, but all the injuries were caused by fire arms.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_505\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"53427436\" id=\"span_450\">281.

The provisions relating to framing of charge against the\n    accused before the trial commences, are contained in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_442\">Code\n    of Criminal Procedure</a>, 1989 (1933 AD) which is applicable to\n    the State of Jammu and Kashmir. The statute requires that\n    every charge framed under the said Code should state the\n    offence with which the accused is charged and if the law which\n    creates the offence gives it any specific name, the offence\n    should also be described in the charge by that name only. The\n    statute further requires that the law and section of the law\n    against which the offence is said to have been committed has to\n    be mentioned in the charge. It is a fundamental principle of\n    criminal law that the accused should be informed with certainty\n    and accuracy the exact nature of the charge brought against\n    him. The object of the statement of particulars to be mentioned\n    in the charge is to enable the accused person to know the\n    substantive charge he will have to meet and to be ready for it\n    before the evidence is given. The extent of the particulars\n    necessary to be given in the charge depends upon the facts and\n    the circumstances of each case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_207\">    16. It is well-settled law that in drawing up a charge, all\n    verbiage should be avoided. However, a charge should be\n    precise in its scope and particular in its details. The charge has\n    to contain such particulars as to the time and place of the\n    alleged offence and the person against whom it was committed\n    as are reasonably sufficient to give the accused notice of the\n    matter with which he is charged. One of the requirements of\n    law is that when the nature of the case is such that the\n    particulars mentioned in the charge do not give the accused\n    sufficient notice of the matter with which he is charged, the\n    charge should contain such particulars of the manner in which\n    the alleged offence was committed as would be sufficient for\n    that purpose. If A is accused of the murder of B at a given time\n    and place, the charge need not state the manner in which A\n    murdered B.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_208\">    17.

The essential part of this part of law is not\n    any technical formula of words but the reality, whether the\n    matter was explained to the accused and whether he\n    understood what he was being tried for. <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_445\">Sections 34</a>, <a href=\"/doc/112749/\" id=\"a_446\">114</a> and\n    <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_447\">149</a> IPC provide for criminal liability viewed from different\n    angles as regards actual participants, accessories and men\n    actuated by a common object or a common intention; and as\n    explained by a five-Judge Constitution Bench of this Court in\n    Willie (William) Slaney v.
