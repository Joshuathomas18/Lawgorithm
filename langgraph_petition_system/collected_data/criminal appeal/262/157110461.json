In this view\n\n                          of the matter, there is no legal evidence to\n\n                          support the charge under Section 399 and\n\n                          402 against the appellants.

Therefore,\n\n                 the prosecution must prove, from some evidence,\n\n                 directly   or    indirectly,   or   from    attending\n\n                 circumstances, that the accused persons had\n\n                 assembled for no other purpose than to make\n\n                 preparation, for commission of dacoity.

Though\n\n                 the word &quot;preparation&quot; has not been defined, in the\n\n                 Penal Code, the prosecution must show some such\n\n                 conduct, to prove the factum of &quot;preparation&quot; by the\n\n                 assembly, and that the accused persons had\n\n                 conceived any such designs for committing dacoity,\n\n                 and, in fact, intended to achieve the object, for\n\n                 which they had assembled.
