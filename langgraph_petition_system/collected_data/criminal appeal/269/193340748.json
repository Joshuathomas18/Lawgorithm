The courts\n                 have to see whether the continuation of the complaint\n                 amounts to abuse of process of law and whether\n                 continuation of the criminal proceeding results in\n                 miscarriage of justice or when the court comes to a\n                 conclusion that quashing these proceedings would\n                 otherwise serve the ends of justice, then the court can\n                 exercise the power under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 482</a> CrPC. While\n                 exercising the power under the provision, the courts\n                 have to only look at the uncontroverted allegation in\n                 the complaint whether prima facie discloses an\n                 offence or not, but it should not convert itself to that\n                 of a trial court and dwell into the disputed questions\n                 of fact.”\n\n     14   (2014) 7 SCC 215\n\fCriminal Appeal No. 1837 of 2019 (@ SLP(crl.)No.6106 of 2019)\nStation House Officer, CBI/ACB/Bangalore vs. B.A. Srinivasan\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                                                                  18</span>\n\n\n\n\n               This decision thus dealt with the parameters which ought to be\n\n     considered while entertaining an application under Section 482 of the\n\n     Code and is not a decision directly on the point.          The decision in <a href=\"/doc/1128894/\" id=\"a_61\">Anil\n\n     Kumar Bose vs. State of Bihar15</a> pertained to a case which had arisen\n\n     after a full fledged trial, where, as regards offence punishable under\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 420</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_63\">34</a> IPC, it was observed that the essential ingredient being\n\n     mens rea, mere failure on part of the concerned employees to perform\n\n     their duties or to observe the rules/procedure may be administrative lapses\n\n     but could not be said to be enough to attract the penal provisions under\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 420</a> IPC.
