SINGH\n\n\n\tThis batch of appeals arises out of an incident which is \nalleged to have taken place on November 2, 1993 in village Utnal \nat about 7.00 p.m. in which one Sangondappa lost his life while \nseveral witnesses, namely PWs, 2, 3, 4, 5 and 6 received injuries at \nthe hands of the assailants.   The case of the prosecution is that \nthere were nine persons who formed themselves into an unlawful \nassembly with the common object of causing the death of the \ndeceased, and in pursuance of the unlawful object of that assembly \nthe deceased was done to death and the prosecution witnesses \nabovenamed were injured. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\tThe charge-sheet had been submitted against nine accused \npersons namely, Nanagouda (A-1), Appasab (A-2), Rudrappa (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3), Siddappa (A-4), Ashok (A-5), Rannugouda (A-6), Raju (A-7), \nLalsab (A-8) and Shankaragouda (A-9).  However A-9 died during \nthe pendency of the trial, but the remaining accused were tried   by \nthe IInd Additional Sessions Judge, Bijapur in Sessions Case No. \n49 of 1994 charged variously under Sections 148/302/326 and 324 \nall read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 149</a> IPC.  The learned Sessions Judge after an \nexhaustive scrutiny of the evidence on record came to the \nconclusion that the case of the prosecution as against A-5, A-7 and \nA-8 was not established and he, therefore, acquitted them of all the \ncharges levelled against them.  He, however, found A-1 and A-2 \nguilty of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 302</a> IPC and sentenced them to \nundergo imprisonment for life and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-, in \ndefault to undergo one month&#x27;s rigorous imprisonment.  He found \nA-6 guilty of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 326</a> IPC and sentenced him \nto undergo rigorous imprisonment for three years and to pay a fine \nof Rs.500/-, in default to undergo one month&#x27;s rigorous \nimprisonment.  A-3 and A-4 were found guilty of the offence \nunder <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 324</a> IPC and they were sentenced to undergo simple \nimprisonment for one month.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">\tSeveral appeals were preferred by the accused as well as by \nthe State of Karnataka.  Criminal Appeal No.1821 of 2001 was \npreferred by the State against the acquittal of A-5, A-7 and A-8 by \nthe trial court.  Criminal Appeal No. 1829 of 2001 was preferred \nby the State contending that A-3, A-4 and A-6 had not been \nadequately punished by the Sessions Court.  Criminal Appeal \nNo.1300 of 2002 was preferred by the State for consolidating the \nappeals preferred by it and against the acquittal of A-3 to A-8 of \nthe charges under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 148</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_7\">149</a> IPC.  A-1 and A-2 \npreferred Criminal Appeal No.1512 of 2001 against their \nconviction and sentence while A-3, A-4 and A-6 filed Criminal \nAppeal No.1402 of 2001 against their conviction and sentence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">\tThe High Court by its impugned judgment and order of \nNovember 26, 2002 dismissed Criminal Appeal No.1512 of 2001 \npreferred by A-1 and A-2 against their conviction and sentence \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 302</a> IPC.  It also dismissed the appeal preferred by \nA-3, A-4 and A-6 against their conviction and sentence.  So far as \nthe State appeals are concerned, it dismissed Criminal Appeal No. \n1829 of 2001 but partly allowed Criminal Appeal No.1821 of 2001 \nand found A-5 also guilty, who had earlier been acquitted by the \ntrial court.  It also partly allowed Criminal Appeal No.1300 of \n2002 inasmuch as it held A-1 to A-6 guilty of the offences under \n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_10\">149</a> IPC and 148 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_11\">IPC</a> and sentenced them to \nimprisonment for life and rigorous imprisonment for 3 years \nrespectively.  It did not pass any separate sentence against A-3, A-\n4 and A-5 under <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_12\">Sections 324</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_13\">326</a> IPC.  It also upheld the \nconviction of A-1 and A-2 under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 302</a> IPC.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\tBefore this Court A-1 and A-2 have preferred Criminal \nAppeal Nos. 1028-1029 of 2003 against the judgment and order of \nthe High Court in Criminal Appeal Nos. 1512 of 2001 and 1300 of \n2002.  A-3, A-4 and A-6 have preferred Criminal Appeal Nos. \n1026 and 1027 of 2003 against the judgment and order of the High \nCourt in Criminal Appeal Nos. 1402 of 2001 and 1300 of 2002.  \nCriminal Appeal Nos. 991-992 of 2003 have been preferred by A-5 \nagainst his conviction by the High Court in Criminal Appeal \nNos.1821 of 2001 and 1300 of 2002.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">\tThe facts of the case are that the deceased Sangondappa and \nthe accused as well as some of the prosecution witnesses are \nrelated to each other.  The occurrence took place on November 2, \n1993.  According to the prosecution, the deceased and his family \nmembers as well as the accused were on cordial terms till about 2 \nweeks before the date of occurrence.  15 days earlier, an \noccurrence is alleged to have taken place which strained the \nrelationship between the parties.  The case of the prosecution is \nthat Srikanth, son of the deceased, had assaulted the younger \nbrother of A-1 when he tried to remove the public tap in village \nUtnal.  According to the prosecution, this provided the motive for \nthe offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">\tOn November 2, 1993 at about 7.00 p.m., according to the \nprosecution, all the nine accused variously armed with axes, sticks \nand cycle chains came to the house of the deceased.  It is not \ndisputed that A-5 to A-7 do not belong to village Utnal but belong \nto another village Masabinal.  It is alleged that they are related to \nA-1.  When the accused approached the house of the deceased they \nwere noticed by the deceased and his family members.  PW-2, \nShivabai, wife of the deceased warned her husband as well as her \nson Irasangappa (PW-16) and the son of the brother of the \ndeceased Shantappa (PW-11) that they should not leave the house \napprehending danger at the hands of the approaching mob.  In fact \nshe took PW-11 and PW-16 inside and kept them in a room, but \nher husband Sangondappa, deceased, paid no heed to her warning \nand proceeded towards the front door of his house saying that the \naccused will not harm him.  The case of the prosecution is that on \nreaching the house of the deceased, A-1 assaulted the deceased \nwith an axe causing an injury behind his right ear.  The remaining \naccused dragged the deceased to a point in-front of the house of \nBapuraya (PW-4).  There the deceased was assaulted by the \nmembers of the mob.  While A-2 assaulted the deceased on his \nchest with the blunt portion of the axe, the others assaulted him \nwith sticks and cycle chains. Many neighbours rushed to the place \nof occurrence which included PW-1, PW-3, PW-4, PW-5 and PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6.  The neighbours who rushed to the rescue of the deceased were \nalso assaulted.  We shall consider the details of the assault on the \nprosecution witnesses at the appropriate place.  As a result of the \nassault, the deceased fell down and the accused ran away believing \nhim to be dead.  All along, according to the prosecution, A-9 (since \ndeceased) exhorted the other accused not to spare the deceased \nsaying that he would spend any amount of money to save them.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">\tThe evidence on record discloses that a telephonic message \nwas received in Police Station Bijapur about an occurrence having \ntaken place in Village Utnal.  PW-46 Police Inspector Batakurki \nimmediately left for Utnal with a police party.  On reaching the \nvillage he found all the injured including the deceased waiting at \nthe bus stand.  Soon a bus came and all the injured were sent to \nBijapur hospital accompanied by a constable.  Sangondapa, \ndeceased, however breathed his last while on way to Bijapur \nhospital.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">\tOn coming to know that the injured had been brought to the \nhospital, PW-44 H.C. Mulla went to the hospital and recorded the \nstatement of Shivabai (PW-2) Ext.P/2 between 10.45 and 11.30 \np.m.  He then came back to the police station and registered Crime \nNo.247 of 1993 at 11.40 p.m. under <a href=\"/doc/1096965/\" id=\"a_15\">Sections 143</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_16\">147</a>/<a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_17\">148</a>/ \n<a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_18\">324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_19\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_20\">504</a> and <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_21\">506</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 149</a> IPC.   On return from \nvillage Utnal PW-46 took up the investigation of the case.  He held \ninquest proceeding on the dead body of the deceased at the Bijapur \nhospital and thereafter visited the place of occurrence and took \nother steps in the course of investigation.  The body of the \ndeceased was sent for postmortem examination which was \nconducted by Dr. Sangappa (PW-30) and the post-mortem report is \nExt.P/22.  The injured witnesses were examined by PW-29, Dr. \nRamappa.  On the following morning the statements of the \nwitnesses were recorded by the police in the course of \ninvestigation.  After investigation PW-46 filed the charge-sheet \nagainst the accused who were put up for trial before the IInd \nAdditional Sessions Judge, Bijapur in Sessions Case No. 49 of \n1994.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">\tThe trial court on appreciation of the evidence on record \ncame to the conclusion that the charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_24\">149</a> was \nnot proved.  According to the trial court there was no common \nobject of the assembly, and each of the accused acted on his own.  \nOn an analysis of the evidence on record it came to the conclusion \nthat the participation of A-5, A-7 and A-8 was highly doubtful and, \ntherefore, acquitted them of all the charges levelled against them.  \nIt held that A-1 and A-2 were the only persons who assaulted the \ndeceased and the injuries caused by them resulted in his death.  \nThey were, therefore, guilty of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 302</a> IPC.  \nA-6 was found to have caused a grievous injury to PW-4.  He was \naccordingly found guilty of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 326</a> IPC.  A-\n3 and A-4 were found guilty of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 324</a> for \ncausing minor injuries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\tOn appeal the High Court came to the conclusion that so far \nA-7 and A-8 are concerned their acquittal was well merited.  So far \nas the other accused are concerned, the High Court held that they \nwere all members of an unlawful assembly, the common object of \nwhich was to commit the murder of the deceased.  It, therefore, \nheld A-1 to A-6 guilty of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_29\">149</a> IPC as \nalso of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 148</a> IPC.  It affirmed the finding \nof the trial court that A-1 and A-2 had caused injuries resulting in \nthe death of the deceased and they were, therefore, also guilty of \nthe offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 302</a> IPC.  The High Court, however, \npassed no separate sentence against A-3, A-4 and A-6 for their \nconviction under <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_32\">Sections 324</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_33\">326</a> IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\tThe question which arises for consideration before us is \nwhether the High Court was justified in coming to the conclusion \nthat A-1 to A-6 alongwith A-9 (since deceased) formed themselves \ninto an unlawful assembly, the object of which was to commit the \nmurder of the deceased.  Before we deal with this moot question, \nwe shall deal with some other aspects of the matter which can be \nconveniently disposed of at this stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">\tSo far A-7 and A-8 are concerned, the courts below have \nconcurrently held them not guilty of any offence.  We propose to \nconsider at this stage the question as to whether the deceased was \nassaulted by any other accused, apart from A-1 and A-2.  In this \nconnection we notice that the trial court has meticulously \nconsidered the evidence on record.  So far as the assault on the \ndeceased by A-1 and A-2 is concerned, the evidence is consistent \nthat these two caused injuries to the deceased.  So far as the other \naccused are concerned, the evidence is not consistent.  PW-2, the \ninformant, alleged in the course of her deposition that A-6 and A-7 \nhad also assaulted the deceased with the wooden handle of the axe \nand a cycle chain respectively.  However, the informant in her first \ninformation report did not say so and, therefore, her evidence in \ncourt as against A-6 and A-7 assaulting the deceased was not \nfound acceptable by the trial court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">\tPW-6 asserted that A-4, A-5 and A-7 had also assaulted the \ndeceased but it was found that he had not said so in the course of \ninvestigation in his statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 161</a> Cr. P.C .  \nThe trial court, therefore, did not accept this part of the evidence of \nPW-6.  PW-4 stated that as many as 5 other accused, apart from A-\n1 and A-2 assaulted the deceased and in this connection he \ninvolved A-3,  A-4, A-6, A-7 and A-8.  No other witness had \nstated so and, therefore, the trial court did not accept this part of \nhis evidence.  On the other hand PWs. 3, 5 and 8 deposed that only \nA-1 and A-2 had actually assaulted the deceased.  On the basis of \nsuch evidence on record, we do not find any fault with the finding \nof the trial court that only A-1 and A-2 assaulted the deceased and \nno other accused assaulted him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">\tSo far as the assault on injured witnesses is concerned, the \ntrial court found that PW-2 stated that she had been pushed by A-4 \nwith the blunt portion of the axe.  PW-3 alleged that A-3 assaulted \nhim with stick.  PW-5 made an allegation of assault against A-4 \nbut he had not made such a statement in the course of investigation \nunder <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 161</a> Cr. P.C.  The trial court, therefore, did not \naccept his allegation as against A-4.  Similarly PW-6 had alleged \nthat A-2 and A-7 had assaulted him but this fact was conspicuously \nabsent from his statement under <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 161</a> Cr. P.C.  PW-4 stated \nthat he had been assaulted by A-4 and A-6.  So far as the allegation \nagainst A-4 is concerned, PW-4 did not involve him in the assault \non him in his statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 161</a> Cr. P.C.  The \ntrial court, therefore, concluded that in the assault on other \nwitnesses only A-3, A-4 and A-6 had participated.  A-5, A-7 and \nA-8 had not taken part in the assault on either the deceased or \ninjured witnesses.  As noticed earlier A-7 and A-8 have been \nacquitted by the trial court as well as by the High Court.  We are of \nthe view that A-5 is also entitled to the benefit of doubt because we \nare satisfied, on the evidence of record, that he did not take part in \nthe assault, even though he may have been present when the \noccurrence took place.  The High Court was not justified in setting \naside his order of acquittal.           \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">\tWe shall now consider the evidence on record which relates \nto the involvement of A-9 (since deceased).  It is no doubt true that \nA-9 died during the pendency of the trial, but his involvement in \nthe occurrence is of some significance particularly on the question \nas to whether the accused had formed themselves into an unlawful \nassembly with the object of killing the deceased.  This is because \nthe case of the prosecution is that when accused persons proceeded \ntowards the house of the deceased, A-9 was exhorting them to kill \nthe deceased assuring them that he would spend whatever money \nwas required for their defence.  PWs. 9 and 10 deposed that they \nwere called to the house of A-9 and told by A-9 that persons had \ncome from village Masabinal and that they had decided to beat the \ndeceased.   Inspite of their dissuading him from doing so, the \naccused persons proceeded towards the house of the deceased and \ncommitted the offence.  Of the several witnesses examined on this \naspect of the matter, PWs. 3, 4, 5, 6 and 8 do not ascribe any role \nto A-9.  PW-2 did not mention his name in the course of \ninvestigation and for the first time while deposing in Court stated \nthat he was exhorting his accomplices to finish the deceased.  \nSimilarly PW-7 deposed that A-9 was exhorting his accomplices to \nfinish the deceased but as stated by the Investigating officer, PW-\n46, he had not said so in the course of investigation when his \nstatement was recorded under <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 161</a> Cr. P.C.  So far as PWs. \n9 and 10 are concerned, the story that they had been called by A-9 \nwho disclosed to them their intention of assaulting the deceased \ndoes not find place in their statements recorded under <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 161</a> \nCr. P.C. as deposed to by the Investigating officer, PW-46.  This \npart of the story was for the first time narrated by them in the \ncourse of their deposition.  The trial court has considered these \ndiscrepancies in the testimony of the above mentioned witnesses.  \nIt held that the presence of PW-7 was doubtful because she being \nthe daughter-in-law of PW-2, she would not have omitted her \nname from the First Information Report when she mentioned the \npresence of so many other witnesses.  In any event, as earlier \nnoticed,  PW-7 in her statement recorded in the course of \ninvestigation did not mention about exhortation by A-9.  For the \nsame reason we find the versions of PW-2, PW-9 and PW-10 not \nreliable in so far as they relate to the involvement of A-9.  \nAdmittedly A-9 did not cause any injury to anyone and the only \nrole ascribed to him was of exhorting his companions to finish the \ndeceased.  We find this part of the story to be unacceptable.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\tIn view of the foregoing, we are of the considered view that \nin the occurrence that took place, only A-1 and A-2 assaulted the \ndeceased while A-3, A-4 and A-6 assaulted some of the \nprosecution witnesses.  So far as A-9 (since deceased) is \nconcerned, his involvement in the occurrence is doubtful.  \nSimilarly the evidence does not establish the involvement of A-5.  \nA-7 and A-8, as earlier noticed, have been acquitted by the trial \ncourt as well as by the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">\tThe next question is as to the offence made out against the \nappellants.  The trial court was of the view that there was no \nunlawful assembly at all and the appellants whose involvement \nwas proved could be punished for their individual acts.  \nAccordingly it found A-1, A-2 guilty of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_40\">Section \n302</a> IPC and A-3, A-4 and A-6 guilty of the offences under \n<a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_41\">Sections 324</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_42\">326</a> IPC.  The High Court on the other hand was \nof the view that A-1 to A-6 had formed themselves into an \nunlawful assembly, the common object of which was to commit \nthe murder of the deceased and they were, therefore, guilty of the \noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_44\">149</a> IPC.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\tHaving regard to the facts of the case we have no doubt that \nA-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-6 had formed themselves into an \nunlawful assembly.  But the moot question which arises, at this \nstage, is as to whether the common object of the unlawful \nassembly was to commit the murder of the deceased or whether the \ncommon object was to give him a beating and cause grievous hurt \nto him.  To answer this question scrutiny of the medical evidence \non record is necessary to find the nature of injuries inflicted.  It \nalso involves looking into other circumstances of the case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">\tThe injured witnesses were examined by Dr. Ramappa (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">29).  He found no external wounds on PWs. 1 and 2.  PW-3, \naccording to him, had suffered an abrasion on left hand anklets \nwhich could have been caused by her bangles but she had also \nsuffered a lacerated wound on the left shoulder which was a simple \ninjury.  On PW-4 he found one abrasion behind the right shoulder \nand four of his ribs fractured.  Obviously the injury was grievous \nin nature.  PW-5 had an abrasion behind his head which was a \nsimple injury.  Similarly, PW-6 suffered an abrasion which was a \nsimple injury.  It is, therefore, apparent that apart from PW-4 the \nother five witnesses had suffered very minor injuries.  The post-\nmortem on the body of the deceased was conducted by Dr. \nSangappa (PW-30).  He found the following ante mortem injuries \non the deceased:-       \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;1.\tAbrasion wound on right side of head i.e. \nbehind ear, measuring 4 x 1 inch broad and \ndeep to the bone, lower bone was broken.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">2.\tLacerated wound on left side of face, chin, \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">3.\tLacerated wound on left side of chest.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">4.\tAbrasion lacerated wound crossed to right \nside on ribs, measuring 6 x 1 inch.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">5.\tIncised wound on left side below shoulder.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">6.\tAbrasion wound on centre finger of right \nside hand and on left index finger.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">7.\tHis chest, neck leveled, below it air was \nfilled, ribs were broken and wound was in \nlungs, the hole was found through it air was \npassing in smooth vessel and spreading on \nto chest &amp; necks.  It is called surgical \nampixoma.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">8.\tLacerated wound on right side of chest \nlower side just outside, one rupees coin type \nwound was found.&quot;  \n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">\tAccording to him there was no injury to the brain nor was \ndeath caused by injury No.1 on the head.  In his view death was the \ncumulative effect of the injuries suffered by the deceased.  The \ndoctor has not stated any one of the injuries was sufficient in the \nordinary course to cause the death.  According to him death was \ndue to shock and hemorrhage as a result of injuries to vital organs.  \nThe medical evidence, therefore, discloses that though the \ndeceased had suffered serious injuries, none of them by itself was \nsufficient to cause the death in the ordinary course.  The death was \nthe result of the cumulative effect of all the injuries.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"651601\" id=\"span_1\">Apparently, \ntherefore, even though A-1 and A-2 were armed with axes, as \ndeposed to by the witnesses, they caused injuries to the deceased \nonly from the blunt side of the axes.  Injury No.1 was no doubt \ncaused by the sharp side of the axe but that injury was not of a very \nserious nature, though having fractured a bone, it was grievous in \nnature.  Having regard to the nature of the injuries and the other \nfacts and circumstances of the case we are of the view that the \nobject of the unlawful assembly was not to commit the murder of \nthe deceased but certainly to cause grievous hurt to him.   Learned \ncounsel for the appellants drew our attention to paragraph 9 of the \njudgment reported in 1994 Supp (3) SCC 235 : <a href=\"/doc/651601/\" id=\"a_45\">Shivalingappa \nKallayanappa and others  vs.  State of Karnataka</a> where in similar \ncircumstances this Court found the appellants guilty of the offence \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_46\">Sections 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_47\">149</a> IPC and only two of the accused who had \ncaused injuries resulting in the death of the deceased were held \nliable for their individual acts and punished under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 302</a> IPC.  \nThat was also a case where some of the appellants, though armed \nwith axes, did not use the sharp side but only gave one or two \nblows on the head with the butt ends.  Some of the accused, who \nwere armed with stick dealt blows only on the legs and/or on the \nhands which were not serious.  In these circumstances this Court \ncame to the conclusion that the common object of the unlawful \nassembly could not be said to be to cause murders and at any rate it \ncould not be said that all the accused shared the same and that they \nhad knowledge that the two deceased persons would be killed and \nwith that knowledge they continued to be the members of the \nunlawful assembly.  It was observed that whether there existed a \ncommon object of the unlawful assembly to commit murder \ndepended upon various factors.</span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">It is true that when  such a question arises for consideration \nby the Court, no judgment can be cited as a precedent howsoever \nsimilar the facts may be.  As was observed by this Court in \nPandurang and others   vs.  State of Haryana : AIR 1955 SC 216  \neach case must rest on its own facts and the mere similarity of the \nfacts in one case cannot be used to determine a conclusion of fact \nin another.  In the instant case, we find that the alleged motive for \nthe commission of the offence was rather flimsy.  Members of the \nprosecution party as well as the members of the defence party were \nrelated to each other and so were most of the witnesses.  It is also \nthe consistent case of the prosecution that till 15 days before the \noccurrence their relationship was cordial.  Only two weeks before \nthe occurrence the son of the deceased had assaulted the younger \nbrother of A-1 who had tried to dismantle the public tap in the \nvillage.  This could hardly provide a motive for committing the \nmurder of the deceased.  The grievance, if any, was against the son \nof the deceased and in any event, even if it is assumed that this \nmay have led to ill will between the parties, it would be too much \nto infer that for this reason the appellants would have decided to \ncommit the murder of the deceased.   The injuries found on the \nwitnesses are simple in nature except the fracture of ribs suffered \nby PW-4.  The injuries were not on vital parts of the body.  It, \ntherefore, does not appear that A-3, A-4 and A-6 shared the \ncommon object to commit murder.  So far as the deceased is \nconcerned, injury no.1 caused by A-1 did not endanger the life of \nthe deceased nor was any one of the other injuries sufficient in the \nordinary course of nature to cause the death of the deceased.  The \nserious injuries found on the chest of the deceased by the doctor \nwere caused by use of the axe from its blunt side.  Death was the \ncummulative effect of all the injuries.  These facts do indicate that \nthe appellants did not intend to cause the death of the deceased, \nand the object of the unlawful assembly could not be to cause the \ndeath of the deceased.   Of course they must have known that if \nthey assaulted the deceased with such weapons as they carried, it \nmay result in grievous hurt to him.  We are, therefore, of the view \nthat in the facts and circumstances of this case, the appellants must \nbe held to have formed an unlawful assembly, the common object \nof which was to cause grievous hurt to the deceased.  They are, \ntherefore, guilty of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_49\">Sections 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_50\">149</a> IPC.  Since \nnone of the injuries found on the person of the deceased was in \nitself sufficient in the ordinary course to cause death, neither A-1 \nnor A-2 can be held guilty of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 302</a> IPC on \nthe basis of their individual act.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">\tIn the result Criminal Appeal Nos. 991-992 of 2003 are \nallowed and A-5 is acquitted of all the charges levelled against \nhim.   Criminal Appeal Nos. 1026 to 1029 of 2003 are partly \nallowed and the appellants therein are acquitted of the charge \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_52\">Sections 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_53\">149</a> IPC and A-1 &amp; A-2 of the charge under \n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_54\">Sections 302</a> IPC.  They are, however, found guilty of the offence \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_56\">149</a> IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous \nimprisonment for five years each and to pay a fine of Rs.500/-, in \ndefault to undergo imprisonment for one month each.  In view of \nthe conviction of the aforesaid appellants under <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_58\">149</a> \nIPC we do not consider it necessary to pass separate sentence \nagainst them under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_59\">Sections 148</a> and <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_60\">324</a> IPC.  The appellants \nmust now surrender to their sentence subject to the provisions of \nSection 428 Cr. P.C.\n          \n\n\n\n\n\n\n</p>","numcites":12,"numcitedby":33,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":1906118,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"section 326 of ipc","formInput":"section%20326%20of%20ipc"},{"value":"section 302 ipc","formInput":"section%20302%20ipc"},{"value":"sec 302/149 IPC","formInput":"sec%20302/149%20IPC"},{"value":"sec 149 ipc","formInput":"sec%20149%20ipc"},{"value":"section 302 indian penal code","formInput":"section%20302%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"unlawful assembly","formInput":"unlawful%20assembly"},{"value":"326 ipc","formInput":"326%20ipc"},{"value":"section 149 of indian penal code","formInput":"section%20149%20of%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"exhorted","formInput":"exhorted"},{"value":"section 324 ipc","formInput":"section%20324%20ipc"},{"value":"sec 326 of indian penal code","formInput":"sec%20326%20of%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"sec.324 of indian penal code ","formInput":"sec.324%20of%20indian%20penal%20code%20"},{"value":"common object","formInput":"common%20object"},{"value":"statement under section 161","formInput":"statement%20under%20section%20161"},{"value":"302/149 of IPC ","formInput":"302/149%20of%20IPC%20"},{"value":"section 324","formInput":"section%20324"},{"value":"section 326","formInput":"section%20326"},{"value":"Grievous  hurt","formInput":"Grievous%20%20hurt"},{"value":"what is hurt","formInput":"what%20is%20hurt"},{"value":"ipc 324","formInput":"ipc%20324"}],"cats":[{"value":"murder","formInput":"tag:murder"},{"value":"cause-hurt","formInput":"tag:cause-hurt"},{"value":"unlawful-assembly","formInput":"tag:unlawful-assembly"},{"value":"repealed","formInput":"tag:repealed"},{"value":"rioting","formInput":"tag:rioting"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
