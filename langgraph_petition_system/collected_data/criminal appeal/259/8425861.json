At the outset, he submitted that none of the accused have\n\n    disputed the factum of bomb explosions and/or people having died or\n\n\n\n\n\n    being injured and of severe damage caused to property in and around\n\n    the place of blast. But he urged that the prosecution has failed to\n\n    establish that the   explosions were      caused by using a particular\n\n    chemical as claimed by the prosecution i.e. attempt to commit the blast\n\n    in BEST Buses at MIDC Seepz and blast committed at Ghatkopar by\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:40 :::</span>\n                                      46                                   conf.5.09\n\n    using bombs containing gelatin sticks and for remaining two incidents\n\n    of bomb blasts by using RDX i.e. at Zaveri Bazar and Gateway of\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n    India.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                    \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_115\">    64.

Further, the said conspiracy ought to be before December,\n                         \n    2002.    Even the evidence about the        same is too sketchy and\n                        \n    unbelievable i.e. in the shape of evidence of the PW-2 approver and the\n\n    evidence of PW-1 and the evidence of confession of accused and that\n      \n\n    too confession of the co-accused. He submits that the prosecution\n   \n\n\n\n    cannot rely on the alleged confession of approver - as he was not tried\n\n    as co-accused.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_116\">    65.       He further urged that the incident of attempt to cause\n\n    explosion was committed on 2nd December, 2002 while the incident of\n\n\n\n\n\n    explosion had occurred on 28th July, 2003 while the remaining two\n\n    incidents of explosion had occurred on 25th of August, 2003. By\n\n    pointing out the provision of Section 219 of the Code, he urged that as\n\n    per the said provision, three offences of the same kind committed\n\n    within a period of one year can be tried together at one trial. The trial\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:41 :::</span>\n                                       47                                   conf.5.09\n\n    conducted for clubbing four incidents together, is illegal. He urged that\n\n    such trial was and in fact caused prejudice to A3.          Hence, the trial\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n    against A3 is vitiated.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                     \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_117\">    66.

It is urged that the charge for every distinct offence as\n\n    required under the law is not framed against A3. The same has caused\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n    prejudice to A3. Hence, it has also occasioned failure of justice.\n</p>                          \n                         \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_118\">    67.       He further urged that encountered accused - Nasir has not\n\n    been named as a co-conspirator in the charge as framed - though\n      \n\n    principal participant. According to the learned Counsel, the evidence\n   \n\n\n\n    regarding the death of Nasir is unbelievable. Amongst other, the SIM\n\n    card recovered near the body of Nasir is not referred to in the charge-\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_119\">    sheet. The evidence regarding purchase of SIM card by Nasir as well\n\n    his encounter will have to be discarded. Besides, the said fact has not\n\n    been established by the prosecution - relying only on evidence of\n\n\n\n\n\n    PW-1 which is insufficient as the same is not substantiated,\n\n    corroborated by any other evidence.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_120\">    68.       He further urged that the prosecution evidence does not\n\n    clearly disclose as to when and how provisions of POTA was applied\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:41 :::</span>\n                                       48                                   conf.5.09\n\n    to this case. For, when A2, 1 and 3 were arrested in connection with\n\n    Ghatkopar incident, POTA was applied. Presumably, it was applied\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n    later on. That was to circumvent the non-compliance of Section 51 r/w\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    32(5) of POTA. On this basis, it is argued that the alleged confessions\n\n    will have to be excluded from consideration - being statements of\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    accused recorded while in police custody before application of POTA\n\n    provisions. He submits that there is serious dispute regarding the date\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n    of arrest of the accused i.e. A1 to 3. According to the prosecution, it is\n                         \n    31st August, 2003, whereas, the defence       claims the arrest on 30th\n                        \n    August, 2003.\n</p>      \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_121\">    69.       He further submits that the defence was denied opportunity\n   \n\n\n\n    to rebut the prosecution evidence. In that, though police officer\n\n    (Gulabrao Pole) who had allegedly recorded confession of Accused in\n\n\n\n\n\n    another case was present in Court he was not allowed to be examined\n\n    by the defence. That police officer had owned up the responsibility of\n\n    planting of bomb in the other case.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_122\">    70.       He further submits that the prosecution evidence itself\n\n    discloses that after recording of alleged confession and production\n\n    before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate, the accused was sent back to\n\n    police custody. That was opposed to Section 32(5) of POTA. Further,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:41 :::</span>\n                                       49                                  conf.5.09\n\n    the accused had partially retracted confession before the Chief\n\n    Metropolitan Magistrate, but later on completely retracted the same.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_123\">    For all these reasons, the alleged confessions will have to be discarded,\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    inter alia, being opposed to provisions of POTA.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                   \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_124\">    71.

The provisions of Section 293\n\n    only makes the reports contemplated under the same as admissible and\n\n\n\n\n\n    does not dispense with the proof of the same.

There is no difficulty in accepting the submission that Section\n\n    60 has been enacted in the light of exposition of the Apex Court in\n\n    Kartar Singh (supra). We would, first, broadly, analyse the purport of\n\n\n\n\n\n    Section 60 of POTA. It envisages that the Central Government and\n\n    each State Government were obliged to constitute one or more Review\n\n    Committees for examining cases under this Act. The constitution of\n\n    such Committee is also specified by this provision in sub-sections (2)\n\n    and (3). The power to be exercised by the Committee flows from\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:47 :::</span>\n                                       83                                   conf.5.09\n\n    Section 60(4). This provision is without prejudice to other provisions\n\n    of the POTA Act.       This provision envisages that application can be\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n    made by aggrieved person to the Review Committee constituted under\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    Section 60(1) calling upon the Committee to review whether there is a\n\n    prima facie case for proceeding against the accused under the POTA\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    Act and issue directions accordingly.      The power conferred in the\n\n    Review Committee to examine such claim of the aggrieved person and\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n    to issue directions as may be warranted is coupled with the duty to do\n                         \n    so. Sub-section (5) provides for the binding effect of the direction\n                        \n    issued by the Review Committee in exercise of power under Section\n\n    60(4) of POTA. The direction issued by the Committee constituted by\n      \n\n    the Central Government is binding not only on the Central Government\n   \n\n\n\n    but also the State Government and the police officer investigating the\n\n    offence.    On the other hand, direction issued by the Committee\n\n\n\n\n\n    constituted by the State Government shall be binding only on the State\n\n    Government and the police officer investigating the offence.           We may\n\n    have to elaborate the purport of binding effect to examine the grievance\n\n\n\n\n\n    made before us, which we intend to do a little later.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_213\">    126.       As regards sub-section (6) of section 60, it postulates that\n\n    direction issued by the Review Committee constituted by the Central\n\n    Government in exercise of power under Section 60(4) shall prevail over\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:47 :::</span>\n                                      84                                   conf.5.09\n\n    the direction issued by the Review Committee constituted by the State\n\n    Government.

It\n                        \n    has been held that any direction issued by the Review Committee on\n\n    such review was binding on the Government concerned and the\n      \n\n    Investigating Officer, but not the Public Prosecutor or the Court under\n   \n\n\n\n    Section 321 of the Code.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_216\">    127.      Reverting to Section 2 of the Repeal Act, it has a saving\n\n    provision. This provision not only repeals the POTA Act of 2002, but\n\n    also saves certain actions and proceedings referred to in sub-section (2),\n\n\n\n\n\n    notwithstanding the repeal of the Principal Act. The proviso to sub-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_217\">    section (2) thereof opens with non-obstante clause. It envisages that\n\n    notwithstanding anything contained in sub-section (2) or in any other\n\n    law for the time being in force, no Court shall take cognizance of an\n\n    offence under the Principal Act after the expiry of the period of one\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:47 :::</span>\n                                        85                                     conf.5.09\n\n    year from the commencement of the Repeal Act. Sub-section (3), once\n\n    again,   opens     with   non-obstante    clause.        It    envisages        that,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                \n    notwithstanding the repeal of Section 60 of the principal Act, the\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    Review Committee constituted by the Central Government under sub-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_218\">    section (1) of that section, whether or not an application under sub-\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                       \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_219\">    section (4) of that section has been made, shall review all cases\n\n    registered under the principal Act to ascertain whether a prima facie\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    case for proceeding against the accused in respect of offences under the\n                          \n    Act is made out.     It further stipulates that the said exercise ought to be\n                         \n    completed within a period of one year from the commencement of the\n\n    Repeal Act.      It further provides that, in cases where the Review\n      \n\n    Committee forms opinion that there is no prima facie case for\n   \n\n\n\n    proceeding against the accused, then, in cases where cognizance has\n\n    already been taken by the Court, the case shall be deemed to have been\n\n\n\n\n\n    withdrawn, and, in cases where investigation was pending, the\n\n    investigation shall be closed, soon after the issuance of direction by the\n\n    Review Committee in that behalf. The Apex Court has interpreted\n\n\n\n\n\n    Section 2(3) of the Repeal Act to the effect that in cases where the\n\n    Review Committee expresses opinion that there is no prima facie case\n\n    for proceeding against the accused, the only role of the Public\n\n    Prosecutor in the matter is to bring to the notice of the Court, the\n\n    direction of the Review Committee.

Sub-section (5) of\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/644982/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 2</a> of the repeal Act is a directory provision.

For, the direction issued by\n                         \n    the Review Committee is made binding on them. However, if the\n    challenge is founded on the assertion that the direction issued by the\n                        \n    Review Committee is ultra vires and complete nullity, we have no\n    manner of doubt that such a challenge would fall outside the purview of\n    binding effect envisaged under Section 60(5) of the POTA Act. It is\n      \n\n\n    well-established position that, if it is demonstrated that the finding is\n   \n\n\n\n    perverse, then, such finding would be a jurisdictional error and\n    consequently nullity.    Those are matters which will have to be\n    examined on case to case basis. It is not possible to countenance the\n\n\n\n\n\n    argument of the defence that the State is completely prohibited from\n    filing writ petition to question the direction issued by the Review\n    Committee because of the mandate in <a href=\"/doc/1568384/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 60(5)</a> of the Act.               For,\n\n\n\n\n\n    indisputably, it is the State Government which has to carry the\n    proceedings by prosecuting the offenders involved in the crime against\n    the society, inter alia, offences under POTA, and in particular, offence\n    against the sovereignty and integrity of the nation, such as falling under\n    the POTA Act.

Even the learned A.P.P.\n\n\n\n\n\n    emphasised that recovery of such articles would nonetheless attract\n    provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1056565/\" id=\"a_129\">Section 3</a> of the Explosive Substances Act and Section\n    4(b) of the POTA Act, on account of unauthorised possession of any\n    arms, dynamites or hazardous explosive substances or other illegal\n    weapons capable of mass destruction or biological or chemical\n    substances of warfare in any area, whether notified or not.

The\n\n    relevant fact is the seizure of unauthorised explosives at the instance of\n\n\n\n\n\n    accused Nos. 4 and 5. The Review Committee could not have ignored\n\n    that evidence and doubted the prosecution case on the ground that it\n\n    could not explain the stand taken by the defence as to why the accused\n\n    would have retained possession of such explosive material even after\n\n    the Bomb Blast incidents.

The Review Committee, then, found that no\n\n\n\n\n\n    admissible evidence or material was pointed out to show, even prima\n\n    facie, that these two accused were party to any such conspiracy.

The Review Committee\n\n    has not adverted to that material at all, though it was on record before it.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                          \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_233\">    A sweeping statement is noted in paragraph 17 that no admissible\n                          \n    evidence or material was pointed out by the prosecution. As a matter of\n                         \n    fact, going by the plain language of Section 60 of POTA and, for that\n\n    matter, even Section 2 of the Repeal Act, it obligates the Review\n      \n\n    Committee to &quot;itself&quot; analyse the entire material placed before it to\n   \n\n\n\n    ascertain whether there is a prima facie case for proceeding against the\n\n    accused. The Review Committee, therefore, could not have rested its\n\n\n\n\n\n    finding merely because the Prosecutor failed to point out any specific\n\n    evidence from the said record assuming that the Prosecutor had, in fact,\n\n    failed to do so. Even if we were to accept the opinion of the Review\n\n\n\n\n\n    Committee on this point, we fail to understand as to how the same can\n\n    absolve accused Nos. 4 and 5 from the charge of <a href=\"/doc/747401/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 4(b)</a> of POTA,\n\n    which can be simpliciter unauthorised possession of explosive\n\n    substance capable of mass destruction.

The next factor noted by the Review Committee in relation to\n\n    charge under <a href=\"/doc/747401/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 4(b)</a> of POTA against accused Nos. 4 and 5 is that\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    the report of the expert / analyst that R.D.X. and detonators allegedly\n\n    recovered from these accused were explosive substances was not placed\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    before it. Even this opinion is criticised by the learned A.P.P. by\n                          \n    pointing out from the record that the C.A. Report was at page 2566 of\n                         \n    the material placed before the Committee pertaining to the samples of\n\n    contraband articles seized at the behest of accused Nos. 4 and 5. The\n      \n\n    said report reveals that the articles were explosive substances, R.D.X.,\n   \n\n\n\n    etc. We find merit in this submission. Accordingly, even this opinion\n\n    will have to be discarded, being perverse and a case of jurisdictional\n\n\n\n\n\n    error committed by the Committee resulting in issuance of directions,\n\n    which are nullity.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_235\">    137.      To conclude, we may observe that the Review Committee, by\n\n    no stretch of imagination, in spite of the material on record, could have\n\n    opined that there was absolutely no evidence against the accused 4 and\n\n    5 with regard to the charge for offence under <a href=\"/doc/747401/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 4(b)</a> of POTA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_236\">    In that case, the Review Committee was obliged to allow the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:49 :::</span>\n                                       97                                   conf.5.09\n\n    proceedings to continue against the accused Nos.4 and 5 at least for the\n\n    said charge.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n                                                     \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_237\">    138.

Again time was sought by defence to recheck the said\n                         \n    aspect and confine the objections to selected questions.

But the fall out of the above practice is\n\n\n\n\n                                                                        \n      this: Suppose the trial court, in a case, upholds a particular\n      objection and excludes the material from being admitted in\n      evidence and then proceeds with the trial and disposes of\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n      the case finally. If the appellate or revisional court, when\n      the same question is re-canvassed, could take a different\n      view on the admissibility of that material in such cases the\n      appellate court would be deprived of the benefit of that\n\n\n\n\n                                               \n      evidence, because that was not put on record by the trial\n      court. In such a situation the higher court may have to send\n      the case back to the trial court for recording that evidence\n      and then to dispose of the case afresh. Why should the trial\n      prolong like that unnecessarily on account of practices\n\n\n\n\n                                 \n      created by ourselves. Such practices, when realised\n      through the course of long period to be hindrances which\n      impede steady and swift progress of trial proceedings,\n                \n      must be recast or re-moulded to give way for better\n      substitutes which would help acceleration of trial\n      proceedings.\n</blockquote>               \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">      13.         When so recast, the practice which can be a\n      better substitute is this: Whenever an objection is raised\n      during evidence taking stage regarding the admissibility of\n      \n\n      any material or item of oral evidence the trial court can\n      make a note of such objection and mark the objected\n   \n\n\n\n      document tentatively as an exhibit in the case (or record\n      the objected part of the oral evidence) subject to such\n      objections to be decided at the last stage in the final\n      judgment. If the court finds at the final stage that the\n      objection so raised is sustainable the judge or magistrate\n\n\n\n\n\n      can keep such evidence excluded from consideration. In\n      our view there is no illegality in adopting such a course.\n      (However, we make it clear that if the objection relates to\n      deficiency of stamp duty of a document the court has to\n      decide the objection before proceeding further. For all\n\n\n\n\n\n      other objections the procedure suggested above can be\n      followed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">      14.         The above procedure, if followed, will have\n      two advantages. First is that the time in the trial court,\n      during evidence taking stage, would not be wasted on\n      account of raising such objections and the court can\n      continue to examine the witnesses. The witnesses need not\n      wait for long hours, if not days. Second is that the superior\n      court, when the same objection is re-canvassed and\n      reconsidered in appeal or revision against the final\n      judgment of the trial court, can determine the correctness\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                                ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:52 :::</span>\n                                         110                                    conf.5.09\n\n                 of the view taken by the trial court regarding that\n                 objection, without bothering to remit the case to the trial\n                 court again for fresh disposal. We may also point out that\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                 \n                 this measure would not cause any prejudice to the parties\n                 to the litigation and would not add to their misery or\n                 expenses.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n                                                         \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">                 15.

Thus upon plain consideration of the provision of <a href=\"/doc/181136/\" id=\"a_154\">Section\n\n    141</a> of the Evidence Act, it is clear that in order to term a question as a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                                                         ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:52 :::</span>\n                                      111                                  conf.5.09\n\n    leading question the same must suggest the answer which is wished\n\n    and/or excepted to be received by the person asking the same.

In other words, if the answer either &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; is expected\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n    from the question, then the said question cannot be said to be a leading\n                         \n    question.\n</p>                        \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_273\">    157.        Now considering the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/900328/\" id=\"a_155\">Section 142</a> of the\n      \n\n    Evidence Act, it permits putting of a leading question in certain\n   \n\n\n\n    contingencies. The earlier part of the said provision relates to putting\n\n    of a question during the examination-in-chief or re-examination in the\n\n\n\n\n\n    event of the same being objected by the adverse party, unless permitted\n\n    by the Court. Thus, the said earlier part clearly confers discretion upon\n\n    the Court to permit asking         leading question even during the\n\n\n\n\n\n    examination in chief or re-examination. Considering the purpose for\n\n    which trials are held, i.e., &quot;quest for the truth&quot;, the Court cannot be a\n\n    silent spectator. In that, even if it were to be a leading question, the\n\n    Court has ample power to permit it if the question is relating to matters\n\n    which are introductory or undisputed or which have been already\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:52 :::</span>\n                                      112                                  conf.5.09\n\n    sufficiently proved. Indeed, the later part of the said section makes it\n\n    abundantly clear that the discretion conferred upon the Trial Court is\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n    not unguided, untrammeled or arbitrary, as guidelines for exercising\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    discretion are found in the said provision. The word, &quot;shall&quot; used in\n\n    the second part of this Section makes it clear, the circumstances in\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    which the Court may permit putting of a leading question during the\n\n    examination in chief      i.e. in respect of matters (a) which are\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n    introductory (b) undisputed and (c) which in the opinion of the Court\n                         \n    has been already sufficiently proved. Thus, it is clear that in the event\n                        \n    of     Court having permitted asking leading questions in the\n\n    examination-in-chief for such a matter, then, granting of permission\n      \n\n    would not amount to improper exercise of discretion or an unfair trial.\n</p>   \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_274\">    158.      In this backdrop, we shall now consider the questions in\n\n\n\n\n\n    respect of which objection was raised in seriatim. Firstly, the question\n\n    pointed out on page 1216 and 1217 of the paper book and the\n\n    objection raised thereto. We do not find any substance in the said\n\n\n\n\n\n    objection raised, as the witness had earlier stated that the bomb was\n\n    near the bus stop. By the said question witness was asked whether\n\n    Hanif had informed him as to where the bomb was kept at Seepz\n\n    (Andheri). The earlier answer given by the said witness reveals that\n\n    Hanif had informed him on phone that there was bomb blast in\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:52 :::</span>\n                                      113                                 conf.5.09\n\n    Ghatkopar, BEST bus at Ghatkopar and the bomb which was kept at\n\n    Seepz (Andheri) had failed. Thus, the said answer conveys two facets\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           \n    i.e. occurring of bomb blast incident at Ghatkopar and secondly that\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    the bomb which was kept at Seepz (Andheri) had failed. The objection\n\n    is in the context of the second aspect describing the place where the\n\n\n\n\n                                                  \n    bomb was kept had failed i.e. Seepz. As aforesaid, the witness in his\n\n    previous answer referred to that aspect.     In the said context even\n\n\n\n\n                                       \n    considering the answer given by the witness and recorded in earlier\n                         \n    paragraph 13 to the effect, &quot;the first bomb blast which was unexploded\n                        \n    was to be caused at Seepz, in Andheri area as bomb blast was planned\n\n    near bus stop on 02.12.2002 .........&quot; This answer conveys the place at\n      \n\n    which the said plan was to be executed i.e nearby the bus. Suffice it to\n   \n\n\n\n    note that the question does not give any clue regarding the nature of\n\n    the said bomb or what had happened to that bomb or the place where\n\n\n\n\n\n    the same was left below the seat.

PW 4 was examined by the prosecution for proving sale of\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n    simcard to encountered accused Nasir i.e. card which was found in a\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    mobile on his person after the encounter. It is the prosecution case that\n\n    said card was purchased by said Nasir under the name Mr. Habib Umar\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    from the retail shop in which PW 4 was working. It was purchased\n\n    from Indu Commercial Corporation - authorized agent for selling the\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n    card for the mobile company. The said fact had already surfaced on\n                         \n    the record during the prosecution evidence led,              including the\n                        \n    examination in chief of PW 4 paragraph 1, 2 and 3. Considering the\n\n    fact that the retailer did not purchase a single card but in bunch of\n      \n\n    cards; and as the prosecution was concerned only with a particular\n   \n\n\n\n    card, the relevant question appears to have been put to PW4. The\n\n    reference regarding the purchase memo Exh. P-278 regarding purchase\n\n\n\n\n\n    of six card had already surfaced on the record.       Thus, the question\n\n    cannot be said to be uncalled for or the manner in which the said first\n\n    question was framed cannot be said to be a leading question, if\n\n\n\n\n\n    considered in light of the later part of <a href=\"/doc/900328/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 142</a> of the Evidence Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_286\">    The same is the case regarding the other question asked to the witness\n\n    as apparently the said purchase memo was not containing entire 10\n\n    digit number of the relevant simcard.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:52 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_287\">                                          116                                conf.5.09\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_288\">    161.

Similarly, the last question <a href=\"/doc/372318/\" id=\"a_157\">referred to\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    above</a>, being put for proving the contents of the documents, the same\n\n    also cannot be said to be a leading question. Such a conclusion is\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    inevitable as none of the said question within themselves was\n                           \n    containing one and only one implicit answer suggested with a hope of\n                          \n    getting the same.     Thus, careful consideration of question asked in\n\n    examination-in-chief and objection raised and answer received clearly\n      \n\n    reveal none of them being leading question, much less impermissible\n   \n\n\n\n    leading question. Thus, we do not find any substance in the objections\n\n    raised and/or infirmity in the conduct of trial due to allowing putting\n\n\n\n\n\n    such questions to the witnesses during examination-in-chief. Hence,\n\n    the argument that grave prejudice has been caused to accused while\n\n    facing the trial, is untenable.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_289\">    162.

The learned APP further urged that considering the answers\n\n    received to the said questions, it is amply clear that no further\n\n\n\n\n\n    questions regarding the said matters were required to be put - as\n\n    putting the same would have amounted to making futile exercise\n\n    and/or observing empty formality. It was urged that such a conclusion\n\n\n\n\n\n    is apparent after considering the said answer received regarding last\n\n    question put to A 1 to 3 respectively regarding the matters contained in\n\n    the confession made. In the said context the learned APP by inviting\n\n    attention to sub-section (5) introduced by the amendment effected to\n\n    the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_168\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> by <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_169\">Amending Act</a> 5 of 2009 urged\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:54 :::</span>\n                                      129                                  conf.5.09\n\n    that the same reveals that the Court can take help of the Prosecutor\n\n    and defence counsel in preparing relevant questions which are to be put\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n    to the accused.

The learned APP further\n\n    submitted that even the decisions pointed out by the learned counsel\n\n\n\n\n\n    for the accused reveals that any material circumstance remained to be\n\n    put to the accused, can be put to him through his Advocate by the\n\n    Appellate Court or the matter can be remanded to the Trial Court for\n\n\n\n\n\n    such a purpose.    It was urged that in spite of the arguments being in\n\n    progress for quite some time and the discussion about the said aspects\n\n    occurred during the proceedings having revealed such a mode being\n\n    permissible, still even at the conclusion of the arguments in these\n\n    proceedings, the learned defence counsel did not bother to point out\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:55 :::</span>\n                                       130                                  conf.5.09\n\n    questions which had remained and ought to be put to the accused.

Similarly, considering the\n\n    provisions of <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C., we also find substance in her\n      \n\n    submission that the word used in sub-section (1) of Section 313\n   \n\n\n\n    &quot;appearing in the evidence against him&quot; deserves to be construed as\n\n    prosecution evidence. Thus, matters contained in the confession not\n\n\n\n\n\n    put to A1, A2 and A3 cannot be said to be detrimental or the same\n\n    cannot be said to be a circumstance causing prejudice to them.

In view of ........................................................................\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">            case for the prosecution. Hence, in our opinion, it is a sound and\n            well established rule of law that the court is concerned with the\n            quality and not with the quantity of the evidence necessary for\n            proving or disproving a fact. Generally speaking, oral testimony\n            in this context may be classified into three categories, namely:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">            (1) Wholly reliable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">            (2) Wholly unreliable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">            (3) Neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">                                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:57 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_388\">                                           149                                    conf.5.09\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_389\">            12.      In the first category of proof, the court should have no\n            difficulty in coming to its conclusion either way- it may convict or\n            may acquit on the testimony of a single witness, if it is found to be\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                   \n            above reproach or suspicion of interestedness, incompetence or\n            subornation. In the second category, the court equally has no\n\n\n\n\n                                                           \n            difficulty in coming to its conclusion. It is in the third category\n            of cases, that the court has to be circumspect and has to look for\n            corroboration in material particulars by reliable testimony,\n            direct or circumstantial. There is another danger in insisting on\n            plurality of witnesses. Irrespective of the quality of the oral\n\n\n\n\n                                                          \n            evidence of a single witness, if courts were to insist on plurality of\n            witnesses in proof of any fact, they will be indirectly encouraging\n            subornation of witnesses. Situations may arise and do arise when\n            only a single person is available to give evidence in support of a\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n            disputed fact. The court naturally has to weigh carefully such a\n            testimony and if it is satisfied that the evidence is reliable and\n                           \n            free from all taints which tend to render oral testimony open to\n            suspicion, it becomes its duty to act upon such testimony. The\n            law reports contain may precedents where the court had to\n                          \n            depend and act upon the testimony of a single witness in support\n            of the prosecution. There are exceptions to this rule, for example,\n            in cases of sexual offences or of the testimony of an approver;\n            both these are cases in which the oral testimony is, by its very\n            nature, suspect, being that of a participator in crime. But, where\n      \n\n\n            there are no such exceptional reasons operating, it becomes the\n            duty of the court to convict, if it is satisfied that the testimony of a\n   \n\n\n\n            single witness is entirely reliable. We have, therefore, no reasons\n            to refuse to act upon the testimony of the first witnesses, which is\n            the only reliable evidence in support of the prosecution.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_390\">    203.       Considering the above, in event of witness being found to\n\n    be from category &quot; reliable witness&quot;, then no corroboration for him\n\n\n\n\n\n    would be necessary. Whether the prosecution witnesses are reliable\n\n    or otherwise will be required to be firstly ascertained and in the event\n\n    of a finding that he/she is not a reliable witness then only the question\n\n    will arise of seeking corroboration for his evidence and/ or discarding\n\n    the same in absence of same.

It was also urged that the defence had also not received\n\n    proper opportunity to establish the defence by examining the witnesses\n      \n\n    intended to be examined by them due to witness was either discharged\n   \n\n\n\n    by the court or the summons being not issued.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_392\">    205.

The addresses of the said press reporters\n\n    were not mentioned. Besides, statement was made that in case of\n\n    their need, the same would be furnished to the Court, for summoning\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_177\">                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:09:57 :::</span>\n                                         151                                  conf.5.09\n\n    the witness. The learned APP thereafter by inviting attention to the\n\n    order dated 4th September 2008 passed by the trial urged that the said\n\n\n\n\n                                                                               \n    order in clear terms reveals that learned counsel for A1 had made\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    statement that he does not want to lead any oral evidence and has\n\n    finished defence evidence.          According to learned A.P.P., this\n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n    document also       reveals that      direction was sought against the\n\n    prosecution for producing photostat copy of confessional statement of\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n    A8 Dr. Abdul Wahid in another POTA case i.e. Special Case No.2 of\n                           \n    2003.     It was urged that photostat copy not being the primary\n                          \n    evidence, the same was rightly rejected by the Court. It was further\n\n    urged that similarly the witness Gulabrao Pole summoned was\n      \n\n    required to be discharged because document sought to be proved\n   \n\n\n\n    through him was not produced by the defence. The position as pointed\n\n    by learned APP is supported from the order sheet. We find it difficult\n\n\n\n\n\n    to accept the grievance of the accused person of not being offered fair\n\n    opportunity to them for producing defence evidence. In fact, they\n\n    themselves had      closed the defence evidence.         Thus, there is no\n\n\n\n\n\n    question of any injustice caused to them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_393\">            Grievance regarding evidence of chief IO PW103\n            and incidental matter\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_394\">    206.

The same has caused grave prejudice to the accused\n\n    as proper investigation was not effected regarding the explosions occurred\n      \n\n\n    and    accused have been unnecessarily made scape goat due to lack of\n   \n\n\n\n    investigation by a competent person.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_395\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"162303\" id=\"span_179\">207.

Having regard to the same, the\n\n    purported defect occurring in Exhibit-573 being not in relation to the matters\n\n    contained in the sanction order but the same is related only with the date of\n\n    issuing the same, we fail to understand the necessity of examining the person\n\n    according the sanction for State of Maharashtra.

With respect to the finding regarding sanction\n                  we are of the opinion that the learned Sessions Judge was\n                  not right in treating it as not legal and valid. <a href=\"/doc/1090977/\" id=\"a_200\">Section 7</a>\n                  does not require a sanction but only consent for\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n                  prosecuting a person for an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1568384/\" id=\"a_201\">Explosive\n                  Substances Act</a>.

To prove the consent the prosecution\n                  had examined PW 52 Balachandran who was then acting as\n                          \n                  the PA of the District Collector.

In his cross-examination he stated that he had not\n      \n\n                  noticed in the relevant file statements of witnesses.\n                  Relying upon this answer given by the witness the learned\n   \n\n\n\n                  Sessions Judge held that in absence of such statements the\n                  District Collector cannot be said to have applied his mind\n                  properly to the facts of the case before granting sanction.\n                  From the evidence of the witnesses and the copy of the\n                  proceedings of the Collector it appears that the Inspector of\n\n\n\n\n\n                  Police had sent his report regarding the evidence collected\n                  by him together with a copy of the FIR, the reports of the\n                  Forensic Department and other connected record.

In the same context\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n    considering the provisions of appointment as contained under Section 23 of\n                          \n    POTA though the same stipulates the word &quot;appointment&quot; in reality the\n\n    same is not a fresh appointment but posting of already functioning Judge\n                         \n    with necessary qualification as envisaged under POTA to act as a Presiding\n\n    Officer for the Special Court. Similarly while construing the nature of any\n      \n\n\n    Notification, the same is required to be considered in the entirety and no\n   \n\n\n\n    conclusion   can be drawn regarding its validaty or invalidity on the basis of\n\n    truncated portion thereof. Thus, considering the notification dated 5th July,\n\n\n\n\n\n    2006 and 27th December, 2006 appointing respective Judges as Presiding\n\n    Officer for Special POTA Court, it is abundantly clear that none of these\n\n    notifications were intending to make fresh appointment,          but     was for\n\n\n\n\n\n    replacing the outgoing presiding officer. Thus, in true sense, the effect and\n\n    nature of the said appointments were in the nature of making posting of\n\n    Judges over the said Court.

The learned defence counsel assailed the aforesaid evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n    by urging that it depicts an absurd position that the accused who was\n\n    willing to make the statement regarding the bombs prepared or the\n\n    material used for the same or the place at which the same were\n\n\n\n\n\n    prepared, had made the statement on two occasions. According to the\n\n    defence, the natural course is that the accused would disclose all\n\n    matters on the first occasion itself. It was urged that the accused\n\n    making such a statement on two occasions and again before two\n\n    different officers militates against the fact that A2, in reality, must\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_222\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:03 :::</span>\n                                      192                                  conf.5.09\n\n    have made such a statement.

It was urged that\n      \n\n    considering all these aspects it is apparent that in order to justify\n   \n\n\n\n    artificial claim of contraband material having been recovered as a\n\n    sequel to the statement, leading to the discovery, made by A2, from\n\n\n\n\n\n    his house and so also from the house of A1. It was urged that in event\n\n    of the loft in the house of A1 was used for preparation of bombs then\n\n    the culprits would have chosen to keep the remaining material at the\n\n\n\n\n\n    said place only without incurring any risk to shift the same to other\n\n    place i.e. to the house of A1 or even in the event of themselves having\n\n    found that loft in the house of A1 for some reason was not suitable to\n\n    keep the remaining material then they would have shifted the same to\n\n    another place.

It\n\n\n\n\n\n    was urged that in spite of the searching cross examination, defence\n\n    failed to shatter the evidence of the said witnesses i.e. panch witnesses\n\n    and police witnesses.

For, careful perusal of both\n\n    memorandum panchnamas i.e. Exhibit P-393 and P-394 reveal that in\n\n\n\n\n\n    fact statement made by accused on both the said occasions though\n\n    pertains to the bomb prepared, still the statement made on both the\n\n    occasion are for different purpose. In that, on the first occasion under\n\n\n\n\n\n    panchnama Exhibit P-393 for the purposes of showing the place at\n\n    which the remaining material used for preparation of the bombs was\n\n    kept; while on the second occasion for showing the place at which the\n\n    bombs were prepared. Thus, bare reading of the evidence pertaining to\n\n    the statement made by A2 on the respective occasion being distinct and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_225\">                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:04 :::</span>\n                                       195                                  conf.5.09\n\n    for separate purpose, there is no merit in the defence submission in this\n\n    regard. Similarly, the contraband material being also found during the\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n    said second visit related to panchanama Exhibit P-394 by itself cannot\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    be said to be circumstance for inferring that after making the said\n\n    statement police and panchas had gone there with the knowledge of\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    their being likelihood of recovery of contraband material even from the\n\n    said place.

In the said context\n      \n\n    it can be further added that the stated events having occurred just after\n   \n\n\n\n    arrest of accused/A2 considering his state of mind after his arrest, it is\n\n    not possible to countenance that he ought to have disclosed all the\n\n\n\n\n\n    matters pertaining to the bombs in the first statement itself. It is well\n\n    known that different persons may act in different manner in the same\n\n    situation. It can be further added that the second statement being made\n\n\n\n\n\n    during the second interrogation made by different officer and the same\n\n    strictly being for different purpose and more so connected with the acts\n\n    committed by A1 and so also at the house of A1, the possibility of A2\n\n    recollecting it at a later stage also cannot be ruled out.

It was contended the\n\n    said description duly indicated of the same being manufactured at the\n\n    factory at Wardha.

Hence, no\n                        \n    conclusion of explosive substance being found in possession of A1, A2\n\n    and A3 is warranted on the basis of prosecution evidence and as such\n      \n\n    they deserves to be acquitted from the charges framed against them in\n   \n\n\n\n    that behalf. It was urged that the same also cast serious doubt about\n\n    the involvement or nexus of A1, A2 and A3 with the incident of\n\n\n\n\n\n    explosion for which the trial has been held and even on that count\n\n    benefit of doubt deserves to be given to the accused.

It was further urged that the\n\n    prosecution at least should have examined panch witnesses and produced the\n\n    original documents such as relevant panchanamas in the present case for\n\n    giving support to the evidence of PW 1. It was urged that the prosecution\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_245\">                                                          ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:06 :::</span>\n                                           213                                    conf.5.09\n\n    having chosen to adduce only the evidence of PW 1 and having withheld\n\n    other independent evidence it will be necessary to draw adverse inference\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                   \n    against the prosecution for withholding material evidence.

They could have been traced on the basis of the material\n                           \n    found with Nasir i.e. his address mentioned in the driving license of\n\n    Ghatkopar, Mumbai area. It was urged that same was necessary in view of\n      \n\n\n    different names/addresses being found in the credit cards. It was urged that\n   \n\n\n\n    similarly the prosecution ought to have shown photograph of encountered\n\n    Nasir to PW4 and PW5 from whom the sim card was allegedly purchased by\n\n\n\n\n\n    the deceased by going to the shop at which he/ they were working. It was also\n\n    urged that substantive evidence of PW1 only talks about sim card of Airtel\n\n    company without disclosing number of said sim card or the mobile number\n\n\n\n\n\n    which could have been easily ascertained by the police by giving call from the\n\n    same. It was urged hence merely on the basis of his evidence, prosecution\n\n    cannot be said to have established that a particular sim card was found in the\n\n    mobile which was said to have been found with the deceased,                    which,\n\n    prosecution alleges to be Nasir.

After considering his evidence, since we\n\n    have not found anything because of which he can be termed as either\n\n\n\n\n\n    unreliable or partly reliable witness and on the contrary having found that he\n\n    is a natural and reliable witness, it is difficult to accept the defence submission\n\n    and/or insistence that his evidence cannot be accepted without there being\n\n    corroboration to his evidence by independent witness merely because PW 1 is\n\n    a police officer. The Apex Court has observed that presumption of honesty\n\n    available to other independent witnesses is equally applicable even in respect\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_248\">                                                           ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:07 :::</span>\n                                          215                                  conf.5.09\n\n    of evidence of the police officer.

In the same\n\n\n\n\n\n    context, it can be further added that though defence had tried to make\n\n    mountain out of the mole regarding identity of the said deceased as being\n\n\n\n\n\n    Nasir, we are unable to see any substance in the same as hardly any evidence\n\n    has surfaced on the record creating a doubt in our mind of the said deceased\n\n    being anybody else other than Nasir. The learned defence Counsel has also\n\n    not brought to our notice any evidence surfaced from record that the police\n\n    investigating the crime, which was registered at Shivaji Park Police Station,\n\n    had not collected the evidence in the form of statements of witnesses residing\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_249\">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:07 :::</span>\n                                           216                                 conf.5.09\n\n    in the neighbourhood or an address found on driving license and/or other\n\n    documents of the said deceased being Nasir.

The core issue involved in the crime registered with Shivaji Park Police\n\n\n\n\n\n    Station being altogether different i.e. whether any offences were committed\n\n    during the said incident when police party, upon information, had been to area\n\n\n\n\n\n    of Ruparel College for nabbing accused Nasir than the issue involved in\n\n    present trial i.e. commission of terrorist act by making bomb explosions\n\n    within Mumbai, in pursuance to the conspiracy hatched; we find it extremely\n\n    difficult to find merit in the said submission.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_533\">    284.

Mr. Pasbola, learned defence counsel has canvassed that as\n\n\n\n\n\n    evidence of PW2 reveals that conspiracy was hatched in August 2002,\n\n    it was incumbent upon the prosecution to lead some evidence to show\n\n    that, in fact, he was in Dubai in August, 2002. It was urged that the\n\n\n\n\n\n    entire evidence of PW2 is of hearsay nature as by and large the same\n\n    talks about the matters allegedly told to him by absconding accused\n\n    Nasir. It was urged that his evidence hardly reveals any participation\n\n    on his part for furthering the object of conspiracy apart from himself\n\n    having not staked claim of being party to the accused which has led to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_264\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:09 :::</span>\n                                      230                                  conf.5.09\n\n    commission of blast in Mumbai. Learned counsel thus contended that\n\n    having due regard to the said factor, it is difficult to accept that PW2\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n    can be said to be party to the crime/conspiracy about which he has\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    deposed.

In the said context, learned counsel also urged that before\n\n    provision of <a href=\"/doc/1946503/\" id=\"a_235\">Section 10</a> of the Evidence Act comes into play, the\n\n    prosecution must establish that there were reasonable ground to come\n\n\n\n\n\n    to the conclusion that two or more persons had conspired to commit an\n\n    offence or an actionable wrong. It was urged that without the said\n\n    aspect being established the recourse to the said section would not be\n\n    permissible and as such matters spoken by PW2 with regard to the\n\n    conspiracy and/or role played by A3 and the other accused would not\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_265\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:09 :::</span>\n                                        231                                 conf.5.09\n\n    be admissible evidence and as such on the said count, the said evidence\n\n    will be required to be excluded from consideration.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n                                                     \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_626\">    303.        After taking into consideration the test laid in <a href=\"/doc/1946503/\" id=\"a_236\">Section 10</a> of\n\n    the Evidence Act, it is for &quot;making things said or done by conspirator\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    in reference to common design&quot;. It must be of &quot;reasonable ground to\n\n    believe&quot;.    The same is not rigorous to the extent of establishing the\n\n\n\n\n                                         \n    fact of the accused persons having conspired together to commit an\n                           \n    offence or an actionable wrong.

Without embarking upon detail discussion\n\n    regarding the said aspect at this stage, it can be safely said that\n\n\n\n\n\n    occurrence of blast at three different places in Mumbai, and an attempt\n\n    to cause blast at MIDC Seepz , manner and mode of causing explosion\n\n    or attempt to explosion being similar i.e. plantation of bomb in public\n\n\n\n\n\n    transport vehicle , such as BEST bus or Taxi , selection of place for\n\n    causing such incident, nature of explosive material used for the same\n\n    i.e. gelatin or RDX for preparing the bomb and involvement of one or\n\n    more accused out of A1, A2 and A3 i.e. A1 and A2 for MIDC incident,\n\n    A1 and A2 in Ghatkopar incident, Nasir and A2 for Zaveri Bazar\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_266\">                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:09 :::</span>\n                                     232                                  conf.5.09\n\n    incident and A1 and A3 for Gateway of India incident as initially\n\n    spelt from prosecution material collected during investigation even de\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           \n    hors confession of A1, A2 and A3 and PW2 and lateron the evidence\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    adduced at the trial,   it is difficult to accept that the totality of\n\n    prosecution evidence was incapable of affording reasonable ground to\n\n\n\n\n                                                  \n    believe that the accused were involved in the said incidents or that\n\n    they had not conspired together.

Furthermore, conspiracy being for\n      \n\n    commission of the explosion at crowded places in Mumbai, to cause\n   \n\n\n\n    terror and thus such an acts being designed to be committed in\n\n    Mumbai, also makes it difficult that PW2 then in Dubai could have\n\n\n\n\n\n    played any prominent role in the episode. However, the close look at\n\n    the evidence of PW2 does reveal the manner in which he was webbed\n\n    in the conspiracy and the co-conspirators were confiding in him\n\n\n\n\n\n    information regarding the object as well the plans hatched in the\n\n    conspiracy, it is difficult to accept that he was not member of the said\n\n    conspiracy. It is now well settled that in the offence of conspiracy, it is\n\n    not even necessary that every conspirator            knowing the other\n\n    conspirators or the role to be performed by him.

We are of the view that the\n\n    evidence of PW 2 cannot be said to be shaken because PW 103 had not\n\n    taken any steps in that regard.

The learned defence counsel thereafter by making reference\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n    to the evidence of PW2 in paragraph no.22 to the effect that he had\n                         \n    been to Bandra Police Station without there being any message from\n                        \n    PW 103, in paragraph no.23 to the effect that on the said day after\n\n    interrogation PW103 had permitted him to go, in paragraph no.25\n      \n\n    regarding non-production of passport, in paragraph no.26 of not\n   \n\n\n\n    making the confession immediately after his production before the\n\n    Court and giving a lame excuse that then he was not under the threat\n\n\n\n\n\n    from the co-accused and the omissions and contradictions recorded in\n\n    paragraph no.33 urged that cumulative effect of all these shakes the\n\n    sanctity of his claim and affords a reason to believe that he was a got\n\n\n\n\n\n    up witness.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_636\">    311.      After carefully examining the answers given by PW 2 in the\n\n    cross-examination,   we find that there is no reason to doubt the\n\n    credibility of this witness. There is no merit in the argument of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_272\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:10 :::</span>\n                                       238                                  conf.5.09\n\n    defence counsel. For, the evidence of PW2 regarding the manner in\n\n    which he had been to Bandra Police Station and the purpose for which\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n    he had been there, we find it difficult that he should have waited for the\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    message from the investigating officer.       In the context of PW103\n\n    having not immediately acted upon the say of PW2, it is difficult to\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    conclude that the same warrants to accept the defence submission that\n\n    it must be inferred that PW2 is a got up witness. It is not unknown that\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n    attempts are made to mislead the investigation or deflecting the police\n                         \n    on wrong track. Thus, there is nothing wrong if PW103 decided to act\n                        \n    upon the information given by PW 2 only after he was reassured about\n\n    it and then arrested PW2. Thus, considering the evidence of PW2 in its\n      \n\n    entirety, it is difficult to accept the argument that such events have the\n   \n\n\n\n    effect of destroying the evidence of PW2.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_637\">    312.       With regard to the contradictions and omissions pointed\n\n    from the evidence of PW2, it will be necessary to say that by and large\n\n    the same are apparently in the nature of minor discrepancies, not fatal\n\n\n\n\n\n    at all.   Considering the reason for which the statement of PW2 was\n\n    recorded by ACP PW103 and by DCP being for different purpose,\n\n    non-occurrence of certain matters in the respective statements cannot\n\n    be given undue importance.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_273\">                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:10 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_638\">                                      239                                  conf.5.09\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_639\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"49826244\" id=\"span_274\">313.      Lastly, the learned counsel for the defence has urged that the\n\n    manner in which the pardon was granted as revealed from the evidence\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n    of PW2 and PW103, the same creates a suspicion of high degree that\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    PW2 is not the real approver but made up approver for suiting the\n\n    purpose of the prosecution.     It was also urged that non-recording\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    statement of PW2 after according a pardon has resulted in causing a\n\n    serious lacuna as due to same defence has been deprived of an\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n    opportunity to check the evidence of PW2 at the stage of trial. The\n                         \n    learned counsel in the same context also placed reliance upon the\n                        \n    decision in the case of Suresh Chandra Bahri ..vs. State of Bihar\n\n    reported in 1995 Supreme Court Cases (Cri) 60 and in a case of <a href=\"/doc/49826244/\" id=\"a_239\">A.\n      \n\n    Devendran .vs. State of T.N.</a> reported in 1998 Supreme Court Cases\n   \n\n\n\n    (Cri) 220, in support of his submission that in view of the provisions\n\n    of Section 306 (4) (a) of the Code read with Section 49 of POTA, it\n\n\n\n\n\n    was necessary to record such a statement.

To our mind, the Special Court has all the powers of a\n             Court of Session and/or Magistrate, as the as the case may be,\n   \n\n\n\n             after the prosecution is instituted or transferred before that Court.\n             The width of the power of the Special Court will be same whether\n             trying such cases as are instituted before it or transferred to it.\n             The use of different words in <a href=\"/doc/1539301/\" id=\"a_243\">Sections 6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1090977/\" id=\"a_244\">7</a> of the Act as\n\n\n\n\n\n             already noticed earlier also shows that the words in <a href=\"/doc/1090977/\" id=\"a_245\">Section 7</a>\n             that the prosecution for any offence shall be instituted only in the\n             Special Court deserve a liberal and wider construction. They\n             confer on the Special Court all powers of the Magistrate including\n             the one at the stage of investigation or inquiry. Here, the\n             institution of the prosecution means taking any steps in respect\n\n\n\n\n\n             thereof before the Special Court. The scheme of the Act nowhere\n             contemplates that it was intended that steps at pre-cognizance\n             stage shall be taken before a Court other than a Special Court.\n             We may note an illustration given by Mr. Salve referring to\n             Section 157 of the Code. Learned counsel submitted that the\n             report under that section is required to be sent to a Magistrate\n             empowered to take cognizance of offence. In relation to offence\n             under the Act, the Magistrate has no power to take cognizance.\n             That power is exclusively within the Special Court and thus report\n             under Section 157 of the Code will have to be sent to the Special\n             Court though the section requires it to be sent to the Magistrate.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_279\">                                                          ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:11 :::</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">                                   243                                   conf.5.09\n\n     It is clear that for the expression &quot;Magistrate&quot; in Section 157, so\n     far as the Act is concerned, it is required to be read as &quot;Special\n     Court&quot; and likewise in respect of other provisions of the Code. If\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          \n     the expression &quot;Special Court&quot; is read for the expression\n     &quot;Magistrate&quot; everything will fall in line. This harmonious\n\n\n\n\n                                                  \n     construction of the provisions of the Act and the Code makes the\n     Act work. This is what is required by principles of statutory\n     interpretation. <a href=\"/doc/1568384/\" id=\"a_246\">Section 9(1)</a> of the Act provides that the Special\n     Court shall in the trial of such cases follow the procedure\n     prescribed by the Code for the trial of warrant cases before the\n\n\n\n\n                                                 \n     Magistrate. The expression &quot;trial&quot; is not defined in the Act or the\n     Code. For the purpose of the Act, it has a wider connotation and\n     also includes in it the pre-trial stage as well. Section 9(2) makes\n     the Special Court, a Court of Session by a fiction by providing\n\n\n\n\n                                     \n     that the Special Court shall be deemed to be a Court of Session\n     and shall have all the powers of a Court of Session. In case, the\n                    \n     Special Court is held not to have the dual capacity and powers\n     both of the Magistrate and the Court of Session, depending upon\n     the stage of the case, there will be a complete hiatus. It is also to\n                   \n     be kept in view that the Special Court under the Act comprises of\n     a High Court Judge and it is a court of exclusive jurisdiction in\n     respect of any offence as provided in <a href=\"/doc/1056565/\" id=\"a_247\">Section 3(2)</a> which will\n     include offences under the Indian Penal Code, the Prevention of\n     Corruption Act and other penal laws. It is only in the event of\n      \n\n\n     inconsistency that the provisions of the Act would prevail as\n     provided in Section 13 thereof. Any other interpretation will make\n   \n\n\n\n     the provision of the Act unworkable which could not be the\n     intention of the legislature. Section 9(2) does not exclude\n     Sections 306 to 308 of the Code from the purview of the ct. This\n     section rather provides that the provisions of the Code shall apply\n\n\n\n\n\n     to the proceedings before the Special Court. The inconsistency\n     seems to be only imaginary. There is nothing in the Act to show\n     that Sections 306 to 308 were intended to be excluded from the\n     purview of the Act.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">     &quot;53.        As noticed, the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/654149/\" id=\"a_248\">Sections 6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1304459/\" id=\"a_249\">7</a> of the\n     Special Courts Act confer much wider power. Everything after\n     institution of the prosecution is required to be done by the Special\n     Court. there is nothing in those provisions or in Section 9 to\n     warrant exclusion of Sections 306 to 308 of the Code from the\n     purview of the Act. Reference may also be made to <a href=\"/doc/895566/\" id=\"a_250\">section 4(2)</a>\n     of the Code which stipulates that the investigation, inquiry and\n     trial of all offences under any other law than the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_251\">Indian Penal\n     Code</a> shall also be dealt with according to the provisions of the\n     Code but subject to any enactment for the time being in force\n     regulating the manner or place of investigating, enquiring into,\n     trying or otherwise dealing with such offences.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_280\">                                                  ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:11 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_646\">                                           244                                     conf.5.09\n\n\n\n           &quot;62.        Our conclusion, therefore, is that the Special Court\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                    \n           established under the Act is a court of exclusive jurisdiction. <a href=\"/doc/1539301/\" id=\"a_252\">Sections\n           6</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1090977/\" id=\"a_253\">7</a> confer on that court wide powers.

Thus considering the provisions pertaining to the Special\n\n\n\n\n                                                          \n    POTA Court constituted under POTA and the powers conferred upon\n\n    the said Court, on the same analogy, it can be safely said that the\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n    POTA Court is a Court of original criminal jurisdiction, having dual\n                           \n    capacity as explained in the decision in a case of Harshad Mehta and\n                          \n    particularly the paragraphs from the same referred herein above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_648\">    Since power to grant a pardon principally relate to the provisions of\n      \n\n    Section 306 and 307 of the Code, it will be necessary to take into\n   \n\n\n\n    account the said provisions.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_649\">    318.

So is the submission of learned counsel\n                        \n    for A2.   It was urged that occurring of such resemblance in the\n\n    questions asked by two different recording officers and/or in all the\n      \n\n\n    said confessions speak volumes regarding the purported confession\n   \n\n\n\n    being not true outcome of the proceedings as claimed to have been\n\n    taken by them and        on the contrary same          gives reasonable\n\n\n\n\n\n    apprehension of same being prepared by the investigating officer. We\n\n    are unable to agree with the said submission canvassed. Inasmuch as,\n\n\n\n\n\n    confession of A1 and A2 being recorded by same recording officer i.e.\n\n    PW88 and the work to be effected by him for the same being of the\n\n    same nature, the possibility of resemblance or repetition cannot lead to\n\n    the conclusion as canvassed.

As already\n\n\n\n\n\n            observed, sub-Sections (2) to (5) of Section 32 have an\n            integral and inseparable connection with the confession\n            recorded under Section 32(1). They are designed to be\n            checks against involuntary confessions and to provide\n            an immediate remedy to the person making the\n\n\n\n\n\n            confession to air his grievance before a judicial\n            authority. These safeguards are, so to say, woven into\n            the fabric of Section 32 itself and their observance is so\n            vital that the breach thereof will normally result in\n            eschewing the confession from consideration, subject to\n            what we have said about the judicial custody. The\n            prescriptions under Section 52, especially those\n            affording an opportunity to have the presence of the\n            legal practitioner, are no doubt supplemental\n            safeguards as they will promote the guarantee against\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_337\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:17 :::</span>\n                                       285                                  conf.5.09\n\n           self-incrimination even at the stage of interrogation;\n           but these requirements <a href=\"/doc/1663039/\" id=\"a_279\">laid down in</a> Section 52 cannot\n           be projected into Section 32 so as to read all of them as\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n           constituting a code of safeguards of the same\n           magnitude. To hold that the violation of each one of\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n           the safeguards envisaged by Section 52 would lead to\n           automatic invalidation of confession would not be in\n           consonance with the inherent nature and scheme of\n           the respective provisions. However, we would like to\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n           make it clear that the denial of the safeguards under\n           sub-Sections (2) to (4) of Section 52 will be one of the\n           relevant factors that would weigh with the Court to act\n           upon or discard the confession.

The learned APP\n\n    further urged that in present case, no violation as tried to be canvassed\n\n\n\n\n\n    by learned defence Counsel has taken place.

The next question is whether there is corroboration of the\n   \n\n\n\n            confession since it has been retracted. A confession of a crime\n            by a person, who has perpetrated it, is usually the outcome of\n            penitence and remorse and in normal circumstances is the best\n            evidence against the maker. The question has very often\n\n\n\n\n\n            arisen whether a retracted confession may form the basis of\n            conviction if believed to be true and voluntarily made. For the\n            purpose of arriving at this conclusion the court has to take into\n            consideration not only the reasons given for making the\n            confession or retracting it but the attending facts &amp;\n\n\n\n\n\n            circumstances surrounding the same. It may be remarked that\n            there can be no absolute rule that a retracted confession\n            cannot be acted upon unless the same is corroborated\n            materially.

In this\n           connection it would be profitable to contrast a retracted\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n           confession with the evidence of an approver or an accomplice.\n           Though<a href=\"/doc/274935/\" id=\"a_282\"> u/s.133</a> of the Evidence Act a conviction is not illegal\n                         \n           merely because it proceeds on the uncorroborated testimony of\n           witnesses, illustration (b) to S. 114 lays down that a court may\n           presume that an accomplice is unworthy of credit unless he is\n                        \n           corroborated in material particulars. In the case of such a person\n           on his own showing he is a depraved and debased individual\n           who having taken part in the crime tries to exculpate himself and\n           wants to fasten the liability on another. In such circumstances it\n      \n\n           is absolutely necessary that what he has deposed must be\n           corroborated in material particulars. In contrasting this with\n   \n\n\n\n           the statement of a person making a confession who stands on a\n           better footing, one need only find out when there is a retraction\n           whether the earlier statement, which was the result of remorse,\n           repentance and contrition, was voluntary and true or not and it is\n\n\n\n\n\n           with that object that corroboration is sought for. Not frequently\n           one is apt to fall in error in equating the retracted confession\n           with the evidence of an accomplice and, therefore, it is advisable\n           to clearly understand the distinction between the two. The\n           standards of corroboration in the two are quite different. In\n\n\n\n\n\n           the case of the person confessing who has resiled from his\n           statement, general corroboration is sufficient when an\n           accomplice&#x27;s evidence should be corroborated in material\n           particulars. In addition the court must feel that the reasons\n           given for the retraction in the case of confessions are untrue.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_749\">    359.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1882779\" id=\"span_345\">In the same context it would not be out of place to make a\n    reference to the earlier decisions in a case of Sarwan Singh Ratan\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_346\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:18 :::</span>\n                                     292                                  conf.5.09\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1882779/\" id=\"a_283\">Singh v.

A1, A3 and their family\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n    members were taken to the office of Bandra Crime Branch where they\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    were questioned. Since A3 could not reply to any of the question\n\n    therefore she was slapped by the Police Officer. Her daughter Farheen\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    was threatened that she would be made to lie on the ice. A1 was\n\n    beaten. Police were forcing them to act as per their direction. After\n\n\n\n\n                                       \n    some days A3 was taken twice in the office of DCP where her\n                         \n    signature was taken on some papers. It is further mentioned in the\n                        \n    retraction Exh.-D-8 that she was threatened in the office of Bandra\n\n    Crime Branch that her son and daughters would also be involved in\n      \n\n    bomb blast case if she refused to make signatures on the papers.\n</p>   \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_754\">    363.      It is important to note that no such stand was taken by A3 in\n\n\n\n\n\n    her examination u/sec. 313 of Cr. P. C. Besides, no explanation is\n\n    offered as to why this retraction was and could not be made at the\n\n    earlier stage. On the contrary, she had affirmed the contents of her\n\n\n\n\n\n    confession. This leads to no other conclusion that the contents of\n\n    retraction Exh.-D-8 are afterthought version of A3 made on the basis\n\n    of legal advise after about seven months from the date of recording of\n\n    her confession. Obviously, it is done only with a view to resile from\n\n    her earlier confession and create doubt about the prosecution story.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_351\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:19 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_755\">                                      295                                 conf.5.09\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_756\">    364.

Hence I.O.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_758\">    was required to arrest her. However later on no further material\n\n\n\n\n\n    showing her nexus with the offence of commission of terrorist act\n\n    being found, she was discharged as per sec. 169 of Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_759\">    364.2     We have already dealt about A1 having admitted the\n\n    substantial matters from the confession made by him after his\n\n    production before CMM. It is significant to note that on the second\n\n    occasion, the A1 only disputed some of the sentences in his confession\n\n    saying that those were not stated by him. We have already dealt with\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_352\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:19 :::</span>\n                                        296                                  conf.5.09\n\n    the same earlier.

It is further urged by Adv. Wahab Khan that A1 has retracted\n                         \n    his confession by sending letter Exh. D-7 dtd. 1-4-2004 to the Court\n\n    and as such no reliance should be placed upon his purported\n      \n\n\n    confession. We find force in the submission of the learned APP that\n   \n\n\n\n    such a retraction being not made at earliest available stage and\n\n    explanation being not given for making the same after six months leads\n\n\n\n\n\n    to the plausible inference that it is afterthought. We, therefore, find that\n\n    the stand of the defence in Exh.D-7 was rightly discarded by the trial\n\n\n\n\n\n    Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_761\">    366.      Similarly, we find that after duly considering the matters\n\n    stated in the said Exh.D-7, dated 1-4-2004, made by A1, retracting\n\n    the confession on the assertion that after returning to home at 8.00 p.m.\n\n    on 30-8-2003 from the Mosque, he had found police engaged in search\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_353\">                                                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:19 :::</span>\n                                      297                                  conf.5.09\n\n    of his house and instead of disclosing reason for the same asked by\n\n    him, they had handcuffed him and taken him along with his wife and\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n    daughters to the office of Bandra Crime Branch alongwith them and\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    questioned about the Gateway of India and Zaveri Bazar blasts and\n\n    had assaulted them and thereafter Mr. Rakesh Maria had slapped his\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    wife as a result of which there was pain in her right ear and during\n\n    police custody remand police officers had taken his signatures on blank\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n    papers and upon raising objection, he was threatened by police saying\n                         \n    that his wife and daughters would be made naked in front of him and\n                        \n    they would be made to sleep on ice. All this forced him to succumb to\n\n    the demand of the police to give confession. Further, on one day he\n      \n\n    was taken before DCP Shri Lokhande who copied one typed matter in\n   \n\n\n\n    Hindi and had asked A1 to sign the same and then he was also told that\n\n    his daughter would be released only after signing the papers which\n\n\n\n\n\n    were already written and hence he had signed upon the confessional\n\n    statement, etc. However, the trial Court found that said belated\n\n    retraction does not deserve any credence.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_762\">    367.

It is further significant to note\n\n    that trial Court, during the reasoning given in paragraph no.162, had,\n\n\n\n\n\n    amongst other, observed about the incident of interference made by A2\n\n    when A1 was answering the questions put to him by Spl.P.P.

The same also bears certificate given by him below the\n      \n\n    confession of PW 88 being satisfied that A1 had made the said\n   \n\n\n\n    confession voluntarily. His evidence also reveals compliance of the\n\n    procedural safeguards. The matters pertaining to the Gateway of India\n\n\n\n\n\n    incident from the said confession are also found corroborated from the\n\n    evidence of PW 15.

In view of the same,\n\n\n\n\n\n    merely because the prosecution witnesses claim of such incidents\n\n    having occurred at the relevant time, that by itself, cannot be sound\n\n    basis to discard their testimony. It can be further added that the\n\n    witnesses having given the evidence upon the relevant aspect on oath\n\n    will have presumptive value of the same being true, unless the same is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_394\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:24 :::</span>\n                                        337                               conf.5.09\n\n    found   shattered   during   the     cross-examination      or    otherwise\n\n    unsustainable for some other reason.

Now with regard to the second submission canvassed that\n                       \n    PW60 had no sufficient time to observe the persons standing in front of\n\n    him in a queue and hence identification made by him of A1 and A2\n      \n\n    becomes highly improbable. We are unable to accept the said\n   \n\n\n\n    submission.   The power of observation and memory differs from\n\n    person to person.     Hence, merely because there was a gap of\n\n\n\n\n\n    occurrence of incident and PW60 getting opportunity to observe the\n\n    culprit at the time of test identification parade held about ten months\n\n    thereafter, by itself, would not be a good ground to discard his\n\n\n\n\n\n    testimony for the same. In the said context, though there may be some\n\n    substance in the plea canvassed that while standing in a queue, PW60\n\n    had initially no reason to pay attention towards two persons standing\n\n    ahead of him in a queue, still after taking into account the further\n\n    events which had occurred and the further fact that PW60 had occupied\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_395\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:25 :::</span>\n                                          338                                    conf.5.09\n\n    the seat by the side of the person who was holding the bag and also\n\n    taking into consideration the time period for which PW60 was along\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                  \n    with the said person i.e. at the stop before boarding the bus and in the\n\n\n\n\n                                                         \n    bus,   militates against the submission that he had no sufficient\n\n    opportunity to observe the said persons to remember them and identify\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    them after such passage of time.

In view of the same and no other\n                          \n    circumstance having surfaced on the record creating doubt in the mind\n\n    about the identification by PW60 of A1 and A2 at the trial, the one\n      \n\n    which is found corroborated by prior identification made by him of A1\n   \n\n\n\n    and A2 at test identification parade, we are unable to accept that his\n\n    evidence is liable to be discarded on the said count.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_855\">    403.

The scrutiny of the evidence of PW-46 does not reveal any\n                        \n    significant material has been elicited during the cross-examination by\n                       \n    the defence affecting the core of his testimony - about the persons who\n\n    had boarded the said bus for route no.340 with a bag and had alighted\n      \n\n    at Marol Naka stop and at that time the bag kept by them beneath the\n   \n\n\n\n    seat had continued to remain at the said place.           After carefully\n\n    considering the answers given by PW-46 during his extensive cross\n\n\n\n\n\n    examination effected by A2, A3 and A5, there appears substance in the\n\n    submission of learned APP that there is no challenge to the fact\n\n    deposed by PW-46 that he was a passenger of the said bus or that the\n\n\n\n\n\n    incident as claimed by him had not occurred. On the contrary, some of\n\n    the questions asked are of nature of confirming the presence of PW-46\n\n    in the said bus. Without enlisting each of the questions posed to\n\n    PW-46, the answers elicited during the cross-examination effected on\n\n    behalf of A2 reveals that he was questioned whether same was first\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_412\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:28 :::</span>\n                                      354                                 conf.5.09\n\n    incident of his life to give window side seat to the woman. He had\n\n    candidly admitted the same. He was thereafter questioned about his\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           \n    education and about his carpentry. However, hardly anything has\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    been extracted for not accepting his say regarding said aspects.            He\n\n    was also questioned whether he had become friendly with the lady and\n\n\n\n\n                                                  \n    the male person after giving a seat, he denied the same. The answers\n\n    given by PW46 regarding the reason because of which he had given\n\n\n\n\n                                       \n    the seat to the said couple, whether he was in the bus until the\n                         \n    explosion, reveals that his claim regarding the same has remained\n                        \n    unshattered.     The perusal of his cross-examination reveals that,\n\n    during cross-examination, his claim of having shifted from rear side\n      \n\n    towards the front portion prior to occurrence of explosion, also has\n   \n\n\n\n    remained unshaken.     The same is the case regarding his claim of\n\n    having seen the said couple while alighting.       PW46 has given a\n\n\n\n\n\n    plausible answer during the cross-examination that his attention was\n\n    then drawn towards them, as he had to accommodate them for getting\n\n    down. It has also surfaced during the cross-examination that he had\n\n\n\n\n\n    not approached the Police for giving a statement but the Police\n\n    approached in the hospital where he was admitted due to the injuries\n\n    suffered by him due to the blast. All the answers given by PW46 to the\n\n    questions put to him regarding his recording of a statement or receiving\n\n    a treatment or reason for going ahead in the bus for alighting, the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_413\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:29 :::</span>\n                                      355                                 conf.5.09\n\n    reason for he wanted to get down at Ghatkopar when he was residing at\n\n    transit camp at Vikhroli etc. have remained unshaken during the cross-\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                                           \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_902\">    examination, rendering his testimony reliable.

It\n\n    discloses that, PW46 during the cross-examination was searchingly\n      \n\n    cross-examined regarding his claim of having gone for carpentry work\n   \n\n\n\n    at Andheri. However, none of the answers given by PW46 to the\n\n    questions about the place at which he had gone for work, the person\n\n\n\n\n\n    who had given the said work, the reason for himself getting the work ,\n\n    the time for which he had been for work and/or had boarded the bus\n\n    for returning etc., have shaken his evidence in any manner. Similarly,\n\n\n\n\n\n    the answers given by PW46 to the questions asked to him generally\n\n    about number of passengers in the bus for the said route or fare for the\n\n    journey also do not reveal any of them has an adverse effect of not\n\n    accepting the claim staked by him.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_414\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:29 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_904\">                                      356                                  conf.5.09\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_905\">    427.      During the said cross-examination PW46 was threadbare\n\n    questioned regarding number of passengers then sitting on the last\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n    bench, about his location, and the location of the woman with Burkha\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    clad and the person accompanying her to whom he had given the\n\n    window seat. However, nothing has surfaced on the record to doubt\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    said claim staked by PW46 in his evidence. The same is the case\n\n    regarding questions put to him during the cross-examination regarding\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n    the course of journey of the bus after he had boarded the same. It is\n                         \n    significant to note that regarding the questions asked about the bag left\n                        \n    in the bus, it has surfaced that PW46 had seen the bag kept beneath\n\n    the seat (kept by the said person) not after bus reaching Ghatkopar\n      \n\n    telephone exchange as suggested to him by the defence, but soon after\n   \n\n\n\n    the said person had alighted the bus. PW46 also answered during the\n\n    cross-examination that he had told about the same to the Conductor\n\n\n\n\n\n    and Conductor had asked in the bus as to whose bag was it, but\n\n    nobody had owned the same. Similarly careful consideration of the\n\n    questions asked to PW46 regarding having moved in the front side in\n\n\n\n\n\n    the bus, the answers received for the same also do not reveal of the\n\n    same causing any adverse effect upon the claim staked by him. The\n\n    same is the case regarding the answers received regarding the\n\n    questions asked about the manner in which the said man and woman\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_415\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:29 :::</span>\n                                       357                                 conf.5.09\n\n    had alighted from the bus from the front side and the place at which\n\n    they had alighted.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n                                                    \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_906\">    428.      Furthermore, it is most significant to note that during the said\n\n    cross-examination it has surfaced on the record         that face of said\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    Burkha clad woman was open when she had sat by the side of window\n\n    and while getting down from the bus. After careful consideration of\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n    all answers regarding those matters, it do not reveal that any\n                         \n    contradictory claim was staked by PW46. Without dilating upon the\n                        \n    further answers received during the said cross-examination effected\n\n    regarding the aspect of treatment taken by him at Rajawadi Hospital,\n      \n\n    the period required for the same regarding recording of his statement\n   \n\n\n\n    and his participation in T.I. parade etc., the same also do not have any\n\n    effect of affecting the core of his testimony of having identified as A2\n\n\n\n\n\n    and A3 being the said person who had boarded the bus with a bag, and\n\n    had left the bag behind while alighting as claimed by him.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_907\">    429.      In the context of the evidence of PW46 , it will be necessary\n\n    to say that the evidence of PW52 Shri Waman Sapre reveals that on\n\n    1.10.2002 at Bombay Central Prison he had held T.I. parade for A1 to\n\n    A3 for identifying witnesses PW46 and PW54. Exh.P-389 is the\n\n    memorandum of the said parade during which PW46 had identified\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_416\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:29 :::</span>\n                                       358                                 conf.5.09\n\n    A2 and A3 as stated in the said memorandum.                After carefully\n\n    considering the evidence of PW52, we are of the considered opinion\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n    that his evidence corroborates the evidence of P.W.46.           In order to\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    maintain the continuity of the discussion, we do not propose to discuss\n\n    the reasons for the same at the present stage and leave the said aspect\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    for discussion at the appropriate stage.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                        \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_908\">    430.      The reasoning given by the Trial Court for not accepting the\n                         \n    evidence of PW-46 and discarding the same in toto is found recorded\n                        \n    in paragraph 252 of the judgment, which reads as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">               &quot;It is stated in the memorandum Exh.P-389 that on\n      \n\n               28.7.2003 at about 9.00 p.m. one person and female in\n               veil were alighting hastily from BEST bus of route No.\n               340 at Marole Pipeline stop. At that time PW-46 was\n   \n\n\n\n               pushed by them and on that count there was altercation\n               in between the said person and the woman and\n               P.W.-46. Evidence of PW-46 is silent on the said\n               incident of altercation and pushing of PW-46 by the\n\n\n\n\n\n               couple while alighting at Marol bus stop. There is thus\n               material discrepancy in the recitals of the memo Ex.P\n               389 and the evidence of P.W.46. Evidence of PW-46\n               lacks in material particulars.       His evidence is\n               completely vague and therefore it can hardly be relief\n               upon. I therefore place no reliance on his testimony.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_909\">    431.      Now examining the same in the light of evidence of PW-46\n\n    already referred to hereinabove - which, as held by us, has remained\n\n    unshaken - clearly reveals that the reasoning given by the Trial Court\n\n    that the evidence of PW-46 is silent on the incident of altercation etc.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_417\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:29 :::</span>\n                                      359                                 conf.5.09\n\n    does not stand to reason.

Without enlisting all the answers in the said cross\n\n\n\n\n\n    examination, it can be safely said that by the same, the claim staked by\n\n    PW-54 during the cross examination that he was pressurized by the\n\n    Police, was shattered.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_920\">    436.      The learned counsel for defence made two-fold submission\n\n    with regard to the evidence of PW-54.           It was urged that the\n\n    prosecution having sought the leave under <a href=\"/doc/1646837/\" id=\"a_291\">section 154</a> of the Evidence\n\n    Act to cross examine the witness itself indicates that the prosecution\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_422\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:30 :::</span>\n                                       364                                  conf.5.09\n\n    had declared that they are not relying upon the evidence of PW-54 due\n\n    to himself being unworthy of any credit. It was urged that, hence, his\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n    evidence cannot be said to be useful to the prosecution for any gainful\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    purpose. Secondly, it was contended that the prosecution, during the\n\n    cross examination, though had got portions marked A, B and C from\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    the previous statement of the said witness, failed to prove the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_921\">    Resultantly, the claim staked by P.W. 54 in his examination-in-chief\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n    remained unshattered by the prosecution. It was urged that hence the\n                         \n    said evidence given by PW-54 in examination-in-chief is binding upon\n                        \n    the prosecution and the said evidence itself runs counter to the\n\n    prosecution case that accused No.3 along with accused no.1 had\n      \n\n    boarded the said bus and occupied the rear seat and while leaving had\n   \n\n\n\n    left the bag below the rear seat of the bus. It was urged that the same is\n\n    obvious as the evidence of PW-54 failed to support evidence of PW-46\n\n\n\n\n\n    of veiled lady (A3) having boarded the bus along with one male person\n\n    (A2) and the further events as claimed by PW-46.                It was thus\n\n    contended that the evidence of PW-54 supports the defence of PW-46\n\n\n\n\n\n    being not a trustworthy witness and the same being planted by the\n\n    investigating agency.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_922\">    437.       It was urged that such a conclusion is apparent as the\n\n    evidence of PW-54 to some extent also denotes of there being no fair\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_423\">                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:30 :::</span>\n                                      365                                 conf.5.09\n\n    play on part of investigating agency during the investigation and the\n\n    trial as the same amongst other also indicates the allegation of PW-54\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           \n    being pressurized by the Police, as claimed by him. It was urged that\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    merely because such factors are not mentioned in the relevant letters by\n\n    PW-54 by itself would be no ground to discard the said claims staked\n\n\n\n\n                                                  \n    by PW-54. It was urged that such a conclusion is inevitable as the\n\n    prosecution has not been able to establish that PW-54 had any reason\n\n\n\n\n                                       \n    to stake such a false claim unnecessarily. It was urged that considering\n                         \n    the prosecution evidence upon the preponderance of probability, the\n                        \n    defence submission is more sound as the presence of PW-54 in the said\n\n    bus is beyond any doubt due to himself being the Conductor of the said\n      \n\n    bus. It was urged that the said witness cannot be reasonably termed as\n   \n\n\n\n    a chance witness and the said witness not supporting the prosecution\n\n    gives severe blow to the prosecution case which they had tried to cook\n\n\n\n\n\n    up and establish through the so called planted witness PW-46.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_923\">    However, the case regarding PW-46 apparently appears to be different\n\n    as except his bare words, there is no other evidence adduced for\n\n\n\n\n\n    establishing that on the relevant date and time he was traveling by the\n\n    said bus. Merely because he was an injured witness, the conclusion\n\n    cannot be drawn that on the relevant date he was traveling by the said\n\n    bus. The same is apparent as he may be one of the injured persons due\n\n    to blast occurred and due to the injuries sustained may be playing as\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_424\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:30 :::</span>\n                                       366                                  conf.5.09\n\n    per the desire of the Police.

Now, considering the other aspect urged that evidence of PW-54\n\n    runs counter to the evidence of PW-46 due to PW-54 nowhere having claimed\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                 \n    of the veiled lady having boarded the bus along with other man or any\n\n\n\n\n                                                         \n    incident as claimed by PW-46 having occurred in between PW-46 the said\n\n    veiled lady and the person accompanying him etc..

For, PW-46 has deposed that the said passengers boarded the\n\n    bus at the first stop itself. Similarly,the relevant events as claimed by PW-46\n      \n\n\n    having occurred in between PW-46, the said veiled lady and the person\n   \n\n\n\n    accompanying her and the said evidence of PW-46 also not revealing that\n\n    PW-54 was nearby present at the time of the said events, would be another\n\n\n\n\n\n    factor to discredit criticism. It can be further added that considering the\n\n    nature of work with which PW-54 was expected to be engaged i.e. distribution\n\n    of tickets to the passengers who had recently boarded the bus, the possibility\n\n\n\n\n\n    of his not paying attention to the matters stated by PW 46 cannot be ruled out.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_933\">    In view of the same, it is difficult to find any substance in the submission\n\n    canvassed on behalf of the defence that the evidence of PW-54 runs counter to\n\n    the evidence of PW-46.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_429\">                                                         ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:30 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_934\">                                           369                                   conf.5.09\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_935\">    442.

After careful perusal of\n\n    the said ruling we are unable to accept this submission of learned A.P.P.\n\n    Inasmuch as the said decisions are on the point of explaining utility of holding\n\n    T.I. parade during the course of investigation for the witnesses who were not\n\n    knowing the culprit.

It also discloses that then said\n\n    Umeshchandra was standing nearby the said taxi and had died in the\n\n\n\n\n\n    explosion occurred on the said day thereafter. Thus the said evidence\n\n    also establishes that the explosion had occurred as a result of the\n\n    luggage which was kept in the said taxi.

Additionally it was\n\n    contended that PW30 is the stock panch witness of the Police and the\n\n    effort of defence to establish the same was      frustrated due to the\n\n\n\n\n\n    defence being not permitted to adduce the evidence regarding the same\n\n    for which they had applied to the Court.

After close scrutiny of the evidence of PW30, we are unable\n\n    to accept the said criticism levelled.

At the most, his evidence would\n\n    warrant close scrutiny regarding such matters but not altogether\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n    rejection of his entire evidence as tried to be canvassed. In view of the\n                          \n    same, we have cautiously scrutinized the evidence of PW30 and so\n                         \n    also the criticized part therefrom recited hereinabove. Upon such a\n\n    scrutiny, we are unable to find any embellishment in his testimony in\n      \n\n    respect of matters for which his evidence is adduced. The defence\n   \n\n\n\n    criticism in general is based on the argument that even this witness in\n\n    respect of the present incident has also come across with the culprit\n\n\n\n\n\n    due to quarrel ensued in between them. That challenge has              already\n\n    been dealt with by us while considering the evidence of witnsess\n\n    regarding incident of attempt to commit explosion at Seepz MIDC.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_973\">    We do not propose to unnecessarily burden this judgment by repeating\n\n    those reasons given.

In view of the same, it is difficult to accept that the said effort of\n      \n\n    defence was frustrated.      Having regard to such order passed, the\n   \n\n\n\n    learned counsel for A1 was queried regarding further follow-up action\n\n    taken by the defence. The learned counsel was candid enough to state\n\n\n\n\n\n    that the concerned Police Station having reported that they were not in\n\n    possession of originals of the said document, the defence had not\n\n    pursued the said matter thereafter. Such being the state of affairs, the\n\n\n\n\n\n    argument of the defence to discard the evidence of PW30 cannot be\n\n    countenanced. Furthermore, the failure of defence to bring such a\n\n    matter will be good justification to draw adverse inference against the\n\n    defence to that extent.

Similarly, after carefully considering deposition of PW15\n\n    and the reasoning given by the trial Court regarding grievance made on\n\n    behalf of the defence, we do not find any substance in the grievance\n\n    made on behalf of the defence of examination-in-chief of PW-15 being\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_476\">                                                   ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:38 :::</span>\n                                       412                                  conf.5.09\n\n    deliberately recorded in piecemeal, and so also of the other witnesses\n\n    to enable the prosecution to allow its officers to tutor the witnesses.

The learned Counsel for A1 and A3 drew our attention to the\n\n\n\n\n                                        \n    answers given by PW 15 during the cross-examination regarding\n                         \n    compensation of Rs.5 Lacs received by him from Shiv Sena Party as a\n                        \n    reward. It was urged that the said answers reveal that though PW 15\n\n    could not hide during the cross-examination that he had received such\n      \n\n    amount from Shiv Sena Party, he gave evasive answers about the said\n   \n\n\n\n    reward. That revealed anxiety on his part not to furnish the details\n\n    thereof. He was unable to disclose precisely the reason for which he\n\n\n\n\n\n    was rewarded. He claimed that he was at native place when he was at\n\n    native place when he was rewarded for bravery. However, he was\n\n    unable to tell as to how Shiv Sena Party came to know about his name\n\n\n\n\n\n    and address or the date on which he was rewarded or the precise place\n\n    in Bandra at which he was rewarded and at whose hands he was\n\n    rewarded or whether at the time of giving reward, he was alone or was\n\n    rewarded in a function. It was urged that even with regard to receipt of\n\n    the amount, he gave evasive answers that he had received the cheque\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_477\">                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:38 :::</span>\n                                       413                                  conf.5.09\n\n    but had not confirmed whether the cheque was in his name or the name\n\n    of his son. He replied of having not seen the cheque himself. He was\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n    also unable to give cogent answers regarding how he knew that he was\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n    rewarded for bravery and so also whether the said amount was\n\n    deposited in his bank. It was urged that the said answers militate\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    against the prosecution claim of PW 15 being truthful and independent\n\n    witness.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                        \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1043\">    495.\n                         \n               After carefully considering the relevant answers, we are\n                        \n    unable to find any merit in the said submission. It is significant to note\n\n    that the fact of PW 15 having received amount of Rs.5 Lacs from Shiv\n      \n\n    Sena Party as a reward has surfaced in an answer to the question asked\n   \n\n\n\n    to him during the cross-examination. He was asked whether he had\n\n    received any compensation from State Government or any private\n\n\n\n\n\n    institution. PW 15 in response to the said question candidly disclosed\n\n    about receipt of such a reward from Shiv Sena Party. We fail to\n\n    appreciate as to how this admission will militate against the\n\n\n\n\n\n    prosecution. It is not possible to countenance the argument of the\n\n    defence that answers given by PW 15 reveal his anxiety to hide\n\n    relevant facts. No such conclusion can be deduced merely because of\n\n    the inability of PW 15 to tell the precise place at Bandra at which he\n\n    had received the said reward or the name of the person at whose hand\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_478\">                                                     ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:38 :::</span>\n                                        414                                conf.5.09\n\n    he had received the award. The same is apparent as further answers\n\n    given by him indicate that he had not attended or personally received\n\n\n\n\n                                                                            \n    the said amount. As noticed earlier, as regards the core facts disclosing\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    the happening of the incident at the spot and the involvement of the\n\n    concerned accused has remained unshaken. The presence of PW 15 at\n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    the spot on the relevant date and time is corroborated by other\n\n    prosecution evidence to which we have already alluded to. The Trial\n\n\n\n\n                                         \n    Court after considering the said aspect in paragraph No.213 of the\n                           \n    Judgment under consideration, had not accepted above stated defence\n                          \n    criticism. We are unable to find any fault with the reasoning given by\n\n    the Trial Court in the said paragraph for not accepting the said\n      \n\n    criticism.\n</p>   \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1044\">    496.         Thus after taking into consideration the aforesaid evidence\n\n\n\n\n\n    we find that learned APP had rightly urged that the criticism made by\n\n    learned counsel for accused persons that evidence of PW-15 is not\n\n    reliable or worthy of credence as the same does not cogently establish\n\n\n\n\n\n    that on the said day or on the day prior to the same he was not driving\n\n    the taxi. That plea is based (a) on the surmises of his licence being not\n\n    renewed, (b) somebody else&#x27;s batch was found in the exploded taxi, (c)\n\n    himself occupying front seat had not proper opportunity to see the\n\n    passengers allegedly taken by him in his taxi and his conduct of not\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_479\">                                                    ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:38 :::</span>\n                                     415                                 conf.5.09\n\n    rushing to the Police for lodging FIR, (d) PW-15 having not seen\n\n    PW-19 and vice-versa. It was rightly urged that none of these factors\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          \n    (expect not lodging an FIR immediately) are capable of drawing\n\n\n\n\n                                                  \n    inference against PW 15.     She has rightly urged that PW15 being\n\n    involved in the incident and having practically lost his means of\n\n\n\n\n                                                 \n    livelihood due to his taxi being substantially damaged and thus\n\n    perplexed, his conduct of not immediately rushing to the Police cannot\n\n\n\n\n                                      \n    be said to be fatal to arrive at such a conclusion more so because\n                         \n    hardly any material was elicited during the cross examination for\n                        \n    jumping to such a conclusion. Her submission that evidence of PW15\n\n    considered as a whole reveals candid answers given by him during the\n      \n\n    cross examination and absolutely no anxiety to hide any matter on his\n   \n\n\n\n    part denotes the same having ring of truth and that the evidence given\n\n    by him under sanctity of oath will have value of presumptive truth\n\n\n\n\n\n    unless it was challenged/damaged by cross examination also merits\n\n    acceptance. Her further submission that the presence of PW-15 at the\n\n    spot has been found confirmed, corroborated or substantiated by the\n\n\n\n\n\n    evidence of two different independent witnesses i.e. PW-16 and PW-20\n\n    also merits acceptance. Significantly, the prosecution has established\n\n    by independent evidence that taxi no.MH-02-R-2007 was damaged in\n\n    the blast which belonged to PW 15, the presence of PW 15 at the spot\n\n    is quite natural.

Hence, in our opinion, it\n                 is a sound and well established rule of law that the court is\n                 concerned with the quality and not with the quantity of the\n\n\n\n\n\n                 evidence necessary for proving or disproving a fact.\n                 Generally speaking, oral testimony in this context may be\n                 classified into three categories, namely:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_186\">                 (1) Wholly reliable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_187\">                 (2) Wholly unreliable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_188\">                 (3) Neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1051\">                 12.

In the second\n                 category, the court equally has no difficulty in coming to its\n                 conclusion. It is in the third category of cases, that the\n                 court has to be circumspect and has to look for\n                 corroboration in material particulars by reliable testimony,\n                 direct or circumstantial. There is another danger in\n                 insisting on plurality of witnesses.

Situations may arise and do arise when only a\n                single person is available to give evidence in support of a\n                disputed fact. The court naturally has to weigh carefully such\n\n\n\n\n                                                          \n                a testimony and if it is satisfied that the evidence is reliable\n                and free from all taints which tend to render oral testimony\n                open to suspicion, it becomes its duty to act upon such\n                testimony. The law reports contain may precedents where\n\n\n\n\n                                                         \n                the court had to depend and act upon the testimony of a\n                single witness in support of the prosecution. There are\n                exceptions to this rule, for example, in cases of sexual\n                offences or of the testimony of an approver; both these are\n                cases in which the oral testimony is, by its very nature,\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n                suspect, being that of a participator in crime. But, where\n                there are no such exceptional reasons operating, it becomes\n                the duty of the court to convict, if it is satisfied that the\n                          \n                testimony of a single witness is entirely reliable. We have,\n                therefore, no reasons to refuse to act upon the testimony of\n                the first witnesses, which is the only reliable evidence in\n                         \n                support of the prosecution.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1052\">              The said observations clearly reveal that the prosecution is\n      \n\n\n    only required to examine the witness necessary to unfold the\n   \n\n\n\n    prosecution story. Viewed from that angle, said Rammani Mishra can\n\n    not be said to be a person necessary to unfold any part of prosecution\n\n\n\n\n\n    story remained to be unfolded at the trial.

As a result of the aforesaid discussion it can be safely said\n\n    that prosecution has duly established that blast had occurred at\n\n\n\n\n\n    Gateway of India due to material containing explosives contained in\n\n    the bag brought by A1 and kept in the dicky of taxi of PW15 which\n\n    was parked at the said place.

Introduction of the evidence against\n         some result in conviction of all, which is to be\n         avoided. By means of evidence in conspiracy,\n         which is otherwise inadmissible in the trial of any\n         other substantive offence prosecution tries to\n\n\n\n\n                            \n         implicate the accused not only in the conspiracy\n         itself but also in the substantive crime of the\n         alleged conspirators. There is always difficulty\n           \n         in tracing the precise contribution of each\n         member of the conspiracy but then there has to be\n         cogent and convincing evidence against each of\n          \n         the accused charged with the offence of\n         conspiracy. As observed by Judge Learned Hand\n         &quot;this distinction is important today when\n         many prosecutors seek to sweep within the\n         dragnet of conspiracy all those who have been\n      \n\n         associated in any degree whatever with the\n         main offender.\n</p>   \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1088\">      8. As stated above it is the unlawful agreement and\n         not its accomplishment, which is the gist or\n         essence of the crime of conspiracy. Offence of\n         criminal conspiracy is complete even though\n\n\n\n\n\n         there is no agreement as to the means by which\n         the purpose is to be accomplished. It is the\n         unlawful agreement which is the gravamen of the\n         crime of conspiracy. The unlawful agreement\n         which amounts to a conspiracy need not be\n\n\n\n\n\n         formal or express, but may be inherent in any\n         inferred from the circumstances, especially\n         declarations, acts and conduct of the conspirators.\n         The agreement need not be entered into by all the\n         parties to it at the same time, but may be reached\n         by successive actions evidencing their joining of\n         the conspiracy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_1089\">      9. It has been said that a criminal conspiracy is a\n         partnership in crime, and that there is in each\n         conspiracy a joint or mutual agency for the\n         prosecution of a common plan. Thus, if two or\n         more person enter into a conspiracy, any act done\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_498\">                                          ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 18:10:41 :::</span>\n                                        433                                    conf.5.09\n\n                        by any of them pursuant to the agreement is, in\n                        contemplation of law, the act of each of them and\n                        they are jointly responsibly therefor.
