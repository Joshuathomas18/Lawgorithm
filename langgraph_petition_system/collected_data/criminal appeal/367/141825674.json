Learned\nSingle Judge considering the fact that appellant\nChampalal Siddh was a government employee and if\nappeal is allowed, then wife of the appellant will\nreceive pecuniary benefits and may also be entitled for\nfamily pension and other benefits, and therefore,\nallowed the application, by restoring Criminal Appeal\nNo.287/2000 to its original position.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">6.

All the eye witnesses\nhave neither named the appellants nor have identified\nas assailants of the deceased Laxman Patil in the\nCourt, therefore, there is no substantive evidence\nagainst the present appellant. He further submitted\nthat these points have been considered                while\nacquitting other four appellants on 17.11.2009 and\nprayed that on the same grounds, the present appeal\nbe allowed and the impugned judgment of conviction,\nwhich was passed against the deceased appellant\n(Champalal Siddh) be set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">8.

According to the prosecution case\n      on 15.10.96 at 09.30 a.m. deceased Laxman\n      Patil reached to the house of PW-1\n      Umashankar and told him that he was called\n      by appellant Vijay Verma for settlement of land\n      dispute, situated near Gayatri Nagar. Witness\n      Umashankar, deceased Laxman Patil, PW-2\n      Mathuralal and PW-13 Suresh reached in a\n      Maruti Car near a temple situated in Gayatri\n      Nagar. They met Ajay Verma, Balmukund,\n      deceased accused Champalal, Nitin and\n      Jitendra Kala. Deceased had talk about land\n      with Ajay Verma and Ajay Verma told him that\n      he may come to his house in the evening at\n      05.00 p.m. along with Satyanarayan Malpani\n      and they will settle the issue. After shaking\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                         6</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                           CRA No.287/2000</span>\n\nhand with Ajay Verma, deceased Laxman and\nwitnesses took turn to go from that place, at\nthat very moment appellants took out swords\nlying in Tata Sieara Jeep and surrounded\nthem. Ajay Verma told that dispute of land\nwould be settled in future, but they would\nsettle the score with them right now and all the\naccused started assaulting Laxman Patil. PW-1\nUmashankar tried to intervene to save\nLaxman, but appellant Jinendra pressed his\nneck and prevented him to intervene. Laxman\nfell unconscious on the ground because of\ninjuries and appellants ran away in Tata Sieara\nJeep. Immediately after the incident PW-27\nthe then Station House Officer Shri Saligram\nPatidar of Police Station Annapurna Nagar\nreceived information from control room about\nthe incident and he reached on the spot where\nA.S.I. Shri Khan, Constable Dayashankar and\nHead Constable Saligram were already present.\nShri Saligram sent deceased Laxman\nimmediately along with constable Dayashankar\nto M.Y. Hospital for examination and\ntreatment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">04.        Shri Saligram also recorded dehati\nnalishi Ex.P/1 at the instance of PW-1\nUmashankar, Dehati Nalishi Ex.P/1 was sent\nto the police station for registration of the\ncrime with Head Constable PW-28 Shri\nSaligram and on the basis of dehati nalishi,\nFirst Information Report Ex.P/36 was\nrecorded by Head Constable Shri Saligram\nhimself. Investigating Officer PW-27 Shri\nSaligram Patidar prepared the spot map\nEx.P/4 and also effected seizure of blood\nstained and controlled earth. When investing\nofficer reached in M.Y. Hospital, he found the\ndeceased Laxman in dead condition and he\nsent intimation to this effect to police station,\non the basis of which merg No.33/1996 was\nregistered in the police station.            The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                        7</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                          CRA No.287/2000</span>\n\nInvestigating Officer prepared the inquest\nreport Ex.P/2 of the deceased and sent his\ndead body for postmortem examination which\nwas conducted by the PW-25 Dr. P.C. Jain.\nPostmortem report is Ex.P/31. Appellants\nwere arrested and on their disclosure\nstatements, weapons were seized.            Shri\nSaligram recorded the statements of the\nprosecution witnesses who were acquainted\nwith the facts of the case and sent the seized\narticles for examination to Forensic Science\nLaboratory.     Forensic Science Laboratory\nreport is Ex.P/40 and P/41 is serologist report.\nOn due investigation charge sheet was filed\nagainst appellants and deceased appellant\nChampalal for the offences under Section 302,\n307/149 and under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 147</a> and <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_13\">148</a> of the\nIPC as well as under <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 25 (1)(B)</a> of the\nArms Act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">05.        The learned Trial Court read over,\nthe charges framed against the appellants, to\nthem and they denied the same, their defence\nwas that they were falsely implicated on\nsuspicion.   Defence of deceased appellant\nChampalal was of alibi, but he did not examine\nany witness in his defence. Learned trial Court\nafter examining the prosecution witnesses and\nhearing both the parties convicted and\nsentenced the appellants as noted herein\nabove.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">06.        We have heard learned Counsel for\nthe parties and also perused the entire record\ncarefully. It is clear from the record and\nimpugned judgment that conviction of the\nappellants Ajay Singh, Balmukund and Nitin is\nbased on statement of eye witnesses recorded\nunder <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 164</a> of the Criminal Procedure\nCode and the conviction of appellant Jinendra\nis based on testimony of three eye witnesses\nPW-1 Umashankar, PW-2 Mathuralal and PW-\n3 Suresh.      Learned Trial Court sought\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                         8</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                            CRA No.287/2000</span>\n\ncorroboration to their testimony from their\nstatements recorded under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 164</a> of the\nCriminal Procedure Code as well as medical\nevidence of Dr. P.C. Jain PW-25.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">07.         It is evident from the record that all\nthe three eye witnesses have not supported the\nprosecution case against appellant Ajay Singh,\nBalmukund and Nitin. They were declared\nhostile by the prosecution and contradicted\nwith their previous statements. All the three\neye witnesses have deposed that they had not\nnamed Ajay Singh, Balmukund and Nitin, in\ntheir earlier statements recorded by the police\nand also by the learned Magistrate. They have\ngiven explanation about their statement before\nlearned Judicial Magistrate First Class that\nbecause of pressure and fear of police, they had\ngiven the statement before the learned\nMagistrate.        Umashankar has deposed\nspecifically that in FIR he mentioned the\nnames of these three appellants under pressure\nby police and in fact these appellants were not\non the spot. All the three witnesses have\ndeposed against appellant Jinendra and\naccording to them along with Jinendra other\nunknown persons had taken part in the\nincident causing injuries to deceased.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1120373\" id=\"span_15\">08.        Learned Trial Court in paragraph 25\nof the impugned judgment has held that\nstatements of all the three eye witnesses are\nfully corroborated by their statements recorded\nunder <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 164</a> of the Criminal Procedure\nCode and relied on the statement under\nSection 164 for the purpose of conviction on\nthe strength of Supreme Court judgment\npassed in the case of Khujji alias <a href=\"/doc/1120373/\" id=\"a_18\">Surendra\nTiwari v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a> AIR\n1991 Supreme Court 1853.</span> We have gone\nthrough this judgment and in our considered\nview in the given facts and circumstances of\nthe instant case judgment rendered by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                          9</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                             CRA No.287/2000</span>\n\nSupreme Court in Khujji&#x27;s case is not at all\nhelpful to the prosecution.        In this case\nSupreme Court has placed reliance on the\ntestimony of the prosecution witness who after\ntaking oath in Trial Court supported the entire\nprosecution case but in cross-examination after\nsome months by defence Counsel, on the\nquestion of identity of the accused he tried to\ntwist and modulate his statement. After cross-\nexamination witness was declared hostile by\nthe prosecution and contradicted with his\nearlier statements.      Supreme Court while\nappreciating the statement of the witnesses\ngiven in Court has relied upon the statement\ngiven in examination-in-chief supporting the\nprosecution case and held that because of lapse\nof time probably witness was influenced by the\ndefence and in cross-examination, to oblige the\ndefence he changed his version on the question\nof identity whereas looking to the entire\nscenario of the incident, the presence of the eye\nwitness on or near the spot and his\nidentification of the accused was beyond doubt\nand fully established.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">09.        In the light of these facts of the case,\nthe ratio decidendi of Khujji&#x27;s case (supra)\nis not at all applicable in the instant case. In\nthe case at hand all these three eye witnesses\nright from the beginning in examination-in-\nchief have not supported the prosecution case\nagainst four accused and they have deposed\nonly against appellant Jinendra.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1456372\" id=\"span_18\">10.       In our considered view learned Trial\nCourt has committed illegality by relying upon\nstatement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 164</a> of the\nCriminal Procedure Code of the eye witnesses\nfor convicting the appellants Ajay Singh,\nBalmukund and Nitin. It is settled legal\nposition that statements of the witnesses\nrecorded under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 164</a> of the Criminal\nProcedure Code can only be used for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                        10</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                           CRA No.287/2000</span>\n\ncontradiction and corroboration to their\nstatement given in Court. Statement recorded\nunder <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 164</a> of the Criminal Procedure\nCode cannot be used as substantive piece of\nevidence (see <a href=\"/doc/1456372/\" id=\"a_22\">George v. State of Kerala</a>\n1998 Supreme Court Cases Vol-IV 605\nPara-36). All the eye witnesses have neither\nnamed these three appellants nor even\nidentified them as assailants of the deceased in\nCourt, therefore, there is no substantive\nevidence in Court given by the witnesses on\noath against these appellants. Hence, question\nof corroboration, to their testimony from their\nstatements under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 164</a> of the Criminal\nProcedure Code, would not arise.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">11.         Now the moot question for us to\ndecide whether testimony of all the three\nwitnesses can be relied upon against appellant\nJinendra or not? It is true that legal maxim\n&quot;falsus in uno falsus in omnibus&quot;, false on one\npoint would be treated as false on all the\npoints, is not applicable in our country. But all\nthe three eye witnesses have given altogether a\nnew story in Court about the incident. They\nhave described major role against appellants\nAjay Singh, Balmukund and Nitin for causing\ninjuries by sword to the deceased in their case\ndiary statements as well as statements\nrecorded by the learned Magistrate, but in\nCourt, they have denied their statements. They\nhave been confronted with their statements\nand their explanation is that under pressure of\npolice, they had given the statements.\nFabrication in first information report is also\nclear from the statement of PW-28 Head\nConstable Saligram who has deposed in\nparagraph-5 that printed book of FIR is\nsupplied to the police station by SP Office, but\nhe brought the FIR book which was prepared\nin the police station. He was called with the\ncounter file of the FIR. For writing and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                        11</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                          CRA No.287/2000</span>\n\npreparation of FIR the prevalent rule is to\nprepare three copies in one stroke meaning\nthereby at the time of recording of FIR, two\ncopies would be the carbon copy out of which\none copy will go to the concerned Magistrate as\nper provision under <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 157</a> of the Criminal\nProcedure Code. Original will remain in the\ncase diary and third will remain as a counter\npart in the FIR book. Printed FIR book is\ncontaining printed page number.          In the\ninstant case, First Information Report Ex.P/36\nis not a printed copy of the FIR supplied by the\nS.P. Office, but it is a photostat copy of the\nprinted FIR wherein the FIR was recorded in\nwriting by Head Constable. He has admitted\nthat counter file of the FIR is not in serial\nnumber, sequence and it was recorded in\nphotocopy of the printed FIR. The counter file\nis not the carbon copy of FIR Ex.P/36 but it\nwas also recorded in handwritten that shows\nthat same were prepared later on. When\nprinted book of FIR is supplied why photocopy\nof the same book was kept in the police station,\nhas not been explained by the prosecution.\nThis shows that the original printed book must\nhave been fully used and some different facts\nwere mentioned in that book about the\nincident, report of which was received on\ntelephone and later on in photostat copy of the\noriginal FIR book the FIR was written later on.\nIt appears that nobody had gone to the police\nstation for lodging the report and nobody was\navailable on the spot when the deceased was\nfound and later on a case has been concocted\nagainst the appellants by creating dehati\nnalishi and recording of FIR in photocopy of\nthe original printed FIR book.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">12.        PW-28 Head Constable Shri\nSaligram has described the procedure of\npreparing FIR and about FIR book as well as\ncounter file of the FIR in Paragraph-4 of his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                           12</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                            CRA No.287/2000</span>\n\n                   statement and he fails to explain as to why FIR\n                   Ex.P/36 was recorded in photostat copy.\n                   Genuineness of the FIR is doubtful and eye\n                   witnesses have also been given altogether a\n                   different story in Court as discussed herein\n                   above, therefore, we do not find it to be a fit\n                   case for maintaining the conviction of the\n                   appellants, on the basis of shaky and doubtful\n                   evidence as well as investigation, hence all\n                   these three appeals are allowed. Conviction\n                   and sentences passed by the learned Trial\n                   Court against the appellants are hereby set\n                   aside.

All the three eye witnesses right from the\n             beginning in examination-in-chief have not supported\n             the prosecution against four accused and have deposed\n             only against appellant Jinendra.       In our considered\n             view, learned trial Court has committed illegality by\n             relying statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 164</a> of the\n             Code of Criminal Procedure of the eye witnesses for\n             convicting the appellant. We are of the view that the\n             conviction and sentence passed against the present\n             appellant (deceased Champalal Siddh) is liable to be\n             set aside and accordingly set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_14\">             12.
