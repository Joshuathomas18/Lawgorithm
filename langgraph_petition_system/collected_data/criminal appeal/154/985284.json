Barai, Ist Additional District and Sessions \nJudge, in his court room and Chambers on 18th November, 1997 at \nBhagalpur in the State of Bihar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">\tFacts of the present case:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\tIn Sessions trial No. 592 of 1992, the Investigating Officer (Jokhu \nSingh) was examined as a witness on 7th May, 1997 in the Court of Shri \nD.N. Barai, Ist Additional District and Sessions Judge, Bhagalpur.  As the \ncross-examination could not be concluded the case was adjourned to 26th \nMay, 1997.  Thereafter the case was adjourned to several dates but this \nwitness did not appear for the cross-examination.  A show cause notice was \nissued against Jokhu Singh through Superintendent of Police, Madhepura, \nrequiring him to appear on 11th June, 1997.  In spite of that Jokhu Singh did \nnot appear.  On 14th July, 1997, a wireless message was sent to him through \nSuperintendent of Police to appear in the court on 5th August, 1997. Once \nagain the witness did not turn up.  The Court, therefore, having no other \noption issued a notice to Jokhu Singh to show cause why proceedings under \nthe <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_1\">Contempt of Courts Act</a> (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the Act&#x27;) be not \ninitiated against him.  Ultimately, on 27th August, 1997 the case was \nadjourned to 20th September, 1997 and to procure his presence, non-bailable \nwarrant was issued.  On this date also the witness did not turn up.  He did \nnot file reply to the show cause notice either.  On 17th November, 1997, \nJokhu Singh appeared in the court in the afternoon.  Having regard to the \nprevious   order of non-bailable warrant of arrest, he was remanded to \njudicial custody.  A petition for bail was filed on his behalf after the court \nhours.  It was directed that the same be placed for hearing on the next date.\t\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">\tShri K.D. Choudhary, one of the appellants who was an office bearer \nof the Policemen&#x27;s Association at District Level and was posted as SHO of \nthe Police Station in the evening of the same day went to the Chambers of \nShri Barai for release of Shri Jokhu Singh on execution of a personal bond.  \nShri Barai did not agree.  Thereafter he approached the District Magistrate \nand on the basis of his advice he met the District Judge and renewed  his \ndemand for release of Jokhu Singh, which was declined.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">\tOn 18th November, 1997, when the bail petition of Jokhu Singh was \ntaken up, the learned counsel appearing on his behalf made a prayer seeking \nwithdrawal of the bail application.  Accordingly, the bail application was \ndismissed as withdrawn.  Soon thereater, a large number of police officers \n(without uniform), armed with lathis and other weapons and shouting \nslogans against Shri Barai, barged into his court room.  The court peon Shri \nBishundeo Sharma who tried to shut the door was brutally assaulted.  Shri \nBarai apprehending danger to his life, rushed to his Chambers and managed \nto bolt the door. Unruly mob forcibly broke open the door, overpowered the \nbodyguard and assaulted Shri Barai.  They reiterated their demand for \nunconditional release of Jokhu Singh. Due to the manhandling Shri Barai \nfelt dizziness and became unconscious.  It was due to timely arrival of a \nteam of doctors that  his life was saved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">\tThe police personnel after assaulting Shri Barai and his court staff, \ntook away certain records and damaged the doors and grills of the gate.  \nThey also assaulted some of the lawyers and damaged their furniture and \nmotor vehicles parked inside the court compound.  Since at the relevant time \nthe District &amp; Sessions Judge, Bhagalpur had gone to Banka for holding \ncamp court and Shri Barai was not in a position to send any report, the 5th \nAdditional District &amp; Sessions Judge sent a report to the High Court \nnarrating the incident.  On the next day, on return from Banka, District &amp; \nSessions Judge also enquired into the matter and submitted a detailed report.  \nIn the report the names of police officials who were identified by the court \nstaff, Shri Barai and the lawyers were also disclosed.  They are (i) A. \nNatarajan, the then Superintendent of Police, Bhagalpur (ii) Harihar Prasad \nChoudhary, the then Deputy Superintendent of Police, Bhagalpur, (iii) K.D. \nChoudhary, the then Inspector of Police, Kotwali P.S., (iv) Ms. Shashi Lata \nSingh, the then S.I., (v) Daroga singh, the then S.I. (vi) P.K. Singh, the then \nS.I., (vii)Rajib Rajan Dayal alias Bhagat, the then S.I., (viii) Gurubachan \nSingh, the then S.I., (ix) Krishna Ram, the then Inspector of Police, (x) C.D. \nJha,  the then A.S.I., (xi) K.N. Singh, the then Officer Incharge of Harijan \nP.S. Bhagalpur and (xii) Ranjit Pandey, the then Sergeant Major, Police \nLine, Bhagalpur.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">\tOn 19th November, 1997, on the basis of the report sent by the 5th \nAdditional District and Sessions Judge, Bhagalpur dated 18th November, \n1997, Original Criminal Miscellaneous Case No. 24 of 1997 was registered \nand placed before a Bench of the High Court for admission.  Along with the \nsaid case Civil Writ Petition C.W.J.C. No. 10625 of 1997 filed on behalf of \nthe Young Lawyers&#x27; Association was also listed.  On perusal of the report \nand after hearing the three Presidents of the High Court Associations and the \nAdvocate General, the Court arrived at the conclusion that a prima facie case \nof criminal contempt was made out against the contemners.  Accordingly \nproceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_2\">Contempt of Courts Act</a> were initiated and a direction \nwas issued to the Registry to issue notices to the above referred persons \nalong with a copy of the report, containing allegations against the concerned \npersons, calling upon them to show cause as to why suitable action be not \ntaken against them for the alleged misconduct.  The show cause was made \nreturnable by 25th November, 1997.  The Chief Secretary and the Director \nGeneral of Police were directed to affirm on affidavits regarding the steps \ntaken by the State Government in the matter relating to the incident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">\tOn 25th November, 1997, all the contemners appeared through their \nrespective advocates.  On a request made the hearing was postponed to 10th \nDecember, 1997 to enable them to file their detailed replies to the show \ncause notice.  Chief Secretary filed his affidavit indicating that the Director \nGeneral-cum-Inspector General of Police after holding a detailed inquiry, \nhad in his report, disclosed names of nine police officials namely (i) K.D. \nChoudhary, the then Officer Incharge, Kotwali, (ii) Ranjit Pandey, the then \nSergeant Major, Bhagalpur, (iii) Ms. Shashi Lata Singh, the then S.I., (iv) \nK.B. Singh, the then Thana Incharge, Harijan P.S. Bhagalpur, (v) \nGurubachan singh, the then S.I., (vi) Daroga Singh, the then S.I., (vii) Prem \nKumar Singh, the then S.I. (Officer Incharge Kajraili), (viii) Rajeev Ranjan \nBhagar, the then S.I., and (ix) C.D. Jha, the then ASI Bhagalpur.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">The Director General of Police found the officers, named above, \nguilty for the alleged incident and condemned the police officials for their \nact.  It was also mentioned in the affidavit that the State Government, acting \non the basis of the report of the Director General of Police, had issued \ndifferent orders, suspending all such officials from service.  Keeping in view \nthe gravity of the situation, a Commission of Inquiry was also set up under \nthe provisions of the Commission of Inquiries Act, 1952.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">Besides the departmental proceedings, different criminal cases were \nalso lodged against them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">On behalf of some of the contemners a request was made to keep the \ncontempt matter in abeyance until the conclusion of the proceedings initiated \nunder various provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">Indian Penal Code</a>, the departmental \nproceedings and the report of the Commission constituted under the \n<a href=\"/doc/1788561/\" id=\"a_4\">Commission of Inquiry Act</a>.  The request was declined by the High Court.  It \nwas held that the pendency of    a criminal case or judicial inquiry could not \nconstitute a bar to the continuation of the contempt proceedings.  But before \nadjourning the proceedings to the next date and having noticed that all the \ncontemners and their advocates were present and every body was \ncondemning the occurrence, the Court expressed the desire that some of the \nresponsible officers like Superintendent of Police, Deputy Superintendent of \nPolice, Inspector of Police Kotwali Shri K.D. Choudhary and  Sub-Inspector \nof Police Ms. Shashi Lata Singh and Sergeant Major of Police Line Ranjit \nPandey should disclose details of the occurrence which had taken place in \nthe court premises on 18th November, 1997  and if possible, identify more \nnames of such persons, who, according to them, had taken part  at the time \nof occurrence.  On the adjourned date of hearing, the Court recorded the \nstatement of (i) A. Natarajan, the then S.P., (ii) Harihar Choudhary, the then \nDSP, (iii) K.D. Choudhary, the then Inspector of Police, Kotwali P.S., (iv) \nMs. Shashi Lata Singh, the then S.I., and (v) Ranjit Pandey, the then Sergeat \nMajor, Bhagalpur.  The Superintendent of Police in his statement fairly \nnarrated a part of the incident and identified certain more names, like \nAwadhesh Singh, Subodh Kumar Yadav and Aswan, Vice-President of the \nAssociation who, according to him, had also taken part in the alleged assault.  \nThe court issued notices to these three persons also calling upon them to \nshow cause why they be also not proceeded for the criminal contempt.  The \nofficials whose statements had been recorded were directed to file their \nadditional or supplementary replies to the show cause on the next date of \nhearing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">On 10th December, 1997, all the contemners appeared and filed \nadditional or supplementary replies to show cause notice.  The \nSuperintendent of Police in his supplementary reply disclosed names of 14 \nmore police officials and constables, who, as per his inquiry, had also taken \npart along with the main persons named earlier.  They are (i) Ram suresh \nSingh &#x27;Nirala&#x27;, SI, (ii) Sriram Singh, ASI, (iii) Ram Rekha Pandey, SI, (iv) \nShivji Singh, SI, (v) B.N. Singh, ASI, Kotwali, (vi) Sukh Narain Sharma, SI, \n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">(vii) D.D. Singh Officer Incharge, Tatarpur P.S., (viii) Gopalji Prasad, SI, \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">(ix) Madhusudhan Sharma O/c Sultanganj P.S., (x) Awadesh Singh, \nConstable, (xi) Subodh Kumar Yadav, Constable, (xii) Ram Prakash \nPaswan, Constable, (xiii) Dilip Ojha, Treasure, Policemen&#x27;s Association, \nBhagalpur, and (xiv) Anil Kumar Soren, General Secretary, Policemen&#x27;s \nAssociation.    \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\">Notices were issued to the above-named persons as well along with \ncopies of the report calling upon them to show cause by 8th January, 1998 as \nto why they be also not proceeded with the criminal contempt.  On 9th \nJanuary, 1998 all the contemners including those fourteen against whom \nnotices were issued on 10th December, 1997 appeared and filed their replies \nto the show cause notice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">At the same time,  affidavits were also filed on behalf of Shri Barai, \nIst Additional District &amp; Sessions Judge, Bhagalpur and his staff namely R. \nDas and B.Sharma and some of the lawyers of the Bhagalpur Court namely \nShri M.P.Singh, President Bar Association, Bhagalpur, Shri Y.K. Rai, \nSecretary, Advocate Assiciation and S/Shri N.K. Choudhary, J.K.,Gupta \n(Secretary, Bar Association), B.N. Mishra and S.C.Pandey, Advocates.  \nCopies of the affidavits filed were served on their opposites on 16th January, \n1998 all the learned advocates appearing for different parties fairly accepted \nthat copies of all the material brought on the record so far was properly \nserved on the advocates appearing for the contemners and those who were \nappearing in support of the contempt proceedings.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">In response to the show cause all the contemners in their affidavits \ncondemned the incident of assault on Shri Barai and the lawlessness created \nin the civil court campus, Bhagalpur.  It would be relevant to notice that \nsome of the contemners like Harihar Choudhary, DSP, K.D. Choudhary, \nInspector of Police and few others have tried to justify the act by saying that \nthere was a resentment amongst the police personnels for the arrest of Jokhu \nSingh and removal of stars from his uniform in the court.  The reply of the \nSuperintendent of Police also indicated that because of such steps taken by \nShri Barai the Police Officers Association led by Shri K.D. Choudhary on \n17th December, 1997 met the Inspector General (Prosecution) and the Zonal \nI.G. and protested against the arrest of Jokhu Singh and the removal of stars.  \nAfter showing their resentment these contemners also criticised the \nunfortunate incident and assault on Shri Barai, and his staff but they denied \ntheir presence at the time of incident in the court premises on 18th \nNovember, 1997.  Show cause notice had been issued to 26 persons.  Except \nfor one or two the remaining asserted that they were not involved in the \nincident and were on duty elsewhere at the relevant time.  In proof of such \ndefence they attached their duty chart etc.\n\nAfter considering the relevant evidence on the record, and after taking \ndue care and caution to see that innocent persons are not punished the High \nCourt dropped the proceedings against the contemners other than Shri K.D. \nChoudhary, Ms. Shashi Lata Singh, Daroga Singh, P.K. Singh, Rajib Ranjan \nBhagat (Dayal), Gurubachan Singh, C.D. Jha, K.N. Singh and Ranjit \nPandey.  Shri K.D. Choudhary was found to be the ring leader of the \ncontemners and was imposed  with the punishment of undergoing simple \nimprisonment for a period of three months and the remaining eight to \nundergo simple imprisonment for a period of two months.  It was made clear \nthat the discharge of rule of contempt notice of the proceedings against the \nother seventeen would not absolve them of  their misconduct and guilt for \ntheir respective offences, if any.  In other words, the departmental \nproceedings initiated by the State Government and the criminal cases \nregistered against them would not be affected by the disposal of the \nproceedings in the criminal contempt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">Learned counsel appearing for the State of Bihar, has fairly stated that \nneither the departmental proceedings nor the criminal cases nor the  \nCommission of Inquiry have been concluded so far. The plea taken is that \nthey are awaiting the result of the present appeals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">Appellants who were convicted under the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_5\">Contempt of Courts Act</a> and \nvisited with the punishment of simple imprisonment have filed five different \nappeals.  S/Shri Daroga Singh, Chakradhar Jha, Shashi Lata Singh and P.K. \nSingh have filed Criminal Appeal No. 316 of 1998, Shri K.D. Choudhary \nhas filed Criminal Appeal No. 332 of 1998, Shri Kedar Nath Singh has filed \nCriminal Appeal No. 318 of 1998, Shri Ranjeet Pandey has filed Criminal \nAppeal No. 317 of 1998 and Shri Gurbachan Singh  and Rajib Ranjan Dayal \nhave filed Criminal Appeal No. 396 of 1998.  Daroga Singh, P.K. Singh, \nC.D. Jha have already retired from service.  The remaining are still in \nservice and posted at different places.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">Learned counsels appearing for the appellants in different appeals, \napart from the merits in individual appeals, which we shall deal with later, \nhave raised some common points challenging the correctness of the \nimpugned judgment.  The same are:  \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(i)\tthe alleged contempt is that of a  court subordinate to the High \nCourt and the allegations made constitute an offence under \n<a href=\"/doc/1969991/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 228</a> IPC, and therefore the jurisdiction of the High \nCourt to take cognizance of such a case is expressly barred \nunder proviso to <a href=\"/doc/583891/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 10</a> of the Act; \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(ii)\tthat the High Court cannot take suo motu notice of the \ncontempt of a court subordinate to it.  The procedure given in \nthe High Court Rules and Orders for initiation of proceedings \nfor contempt of subordinate court having not been followed the \nentire proceedings are vitiated and liable to be quashed; \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(iii)\tthe standard of proof required in the criminal contempt is the \nsame as in a criminal charge and therefore the charge of \ncriminal contempt has to be proved by holding a trial as in a \ncriminal case. The appellants could not be convicted on the \nbasis of evidence by way of affidavits only.  The witnesses  \nshould have been examined in Court and in any case the \nappellants should have been given an opportunity to cross-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">examine the persons who had deposed against them on \naffidavits to verify the version of the incident as according to \nthem there were conflicting versions of the incident; \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">(iv)\treasonable and adequate opportunity was not afforded to the \nappellants either to defend themselves or put forward their case; \nand \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">(v)\taffidavits of independent witnesses which were on record have \nnot been dealt with by the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">Answer to the first point would depend upon the interpretation to be \nput on <a href=\"/doc/583891/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 10</a> of the Act.  <a href=\"/doc/583891/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 10</a> which deals with the power of the \nHigh Court to punish for the contempt of subordinate courts reads:  \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">&quot;10. Power of High Court to punish contempts \nof subordinate courts.- Every High Court shall \nhave and exercise the same jurisdiction, powers \nand authority, in accordance with the same \nprocedure and practice, in respect of contempts of \ncourts subordinate to it as it has and exercises in \nrespect of contempts of itself:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\tProvided that no High Court shall take \ncognizance of a contempt alleged to have been \ncommitted in respect of a court subordinate to it \nwhere such contempt is an offence punishable \nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">Indian Penal Code</a> (45 of 1860).&quot; \n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\"> \tAccording to the learned counsels appearing for the appellants the \nproviso to <a href=\"/doc/583891/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 10</a> means that if the act by which a party is alleged to \nhave committed  contempt of a subordinate court constitutes offence of any \ndescription whatsoever punishable under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_12\">Indian Penal Code</a>, the High \nCourt is precluded from taking cognizance of it.  According to them in the \npresent case the allegations made amounts to an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1969991/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 228</a> \nof the Indian Penal Code and consequently the jurisdiction of the High Court \nis barred.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"27473\" id=\"span_1\">We do not find any  force in this submission.  The point raised is \nconcluded against the appellants by a judgment of the Constitution Bench of \nthis Court in  <a href=\"/doc/27473/\" id=\"a_14\">Bathina Ramakrishna Reddy Vs. The State of Madras</a>,  \n1952 SCR 425.  In that case, sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/1737746/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 2</a>  of the Contempt of \nCourts Act, 1926 which is similar to proviso to <a href=\"/doc/583891/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 10</a> of the Act was \nunder consideration.  <a href=\"/doc/1737746/\" id=\"a_17\">Section  2(3)</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1926 \nprovided that no High Court shall take cognizance of a contempt alleged to \nhave been committed in respect of a court subordinate to it where such \ncontempt is an offence punishable under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_18\">Indian Penal Code</a>.  Interpreting \nthis Section, it was held that sub-section (3) excluded the jurisdiction of the \nHigh Court to take cognizance of a contempt alleged to have been \ncommitted in respect of a court subordinate to it only in cases where the acts \nalleged to constitute contempt are punishable as contempt under specific \nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_19\">Indian Penal Code</a>, but not where these acts merely amount \nto offences of other description for which punishment has been provided  in \nthe <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_20\">Indian Penal Code</a>.</span> \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1108491\" id=\"span_2\">This judgment was analyzed and followed by a Bench of three Judges \nof this Court in the <a href=\"/doc/1108491/\" id=\"a_21\">State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.

In this case as well the point arose regarding the interpretation to be \nput to a similar provision and it was held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"27473\" id=\"span_3\">&quot;The sub-section was considered in two decisions \nof this Court, <a href=\"/doc/27473/\" id=\"a_22\">Bathina Ramakrishna Reddy v. The \nState of Madras</a> ([1952] S.C.R. 425) and Brahma \nPrakash Sharma v. The State of Uttar Pradesh \n([1953] S.C.R. 1169). In the earlier case of \nRamakrishna Reddy ([1952] S.C.R. 425) the \nappellant was the publisher and managing editor \nof a Telugu Weekly known as &quot;Praja Rajyam&quot;. In \nan issue of the said paper dated February 10, \n1949, an article appeared which contained \ndefamatory statements about the stationary Sub-\nMagistrate, Kovvur, and the point for \nconsideration was if the jurisdiction of the High \nCourt to take cognisance of such a case was \nexpressly barred under <a href=\"/doc/1737746/\" id=\"a_23\">section 2(3)</a> of the earlier \n<a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_24\">Contempt of Courts Act</a>, when the allegations \nmade in the article in question constituted an \noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_25\">section 499</a>, Indian Penal Code. On \nbehalf of the appellant it was argued that what the \nsub-section meant was that if the act by which the \nparty was alleged to have committed contempt of \na subordinate court constituted offence of any \ndescription whatsoever punishable under the \n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_26\">Indian Penal Code</a>, the High Court was precluded \nfrom taking cognizance of it. This argument was \nrepelled and this Court said (at page 429) :-</span> \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;In our opinion, the sub-section referred to \nabove excludes the jurisdiction of High \nCourt only in cases where the acts alleged to \nconstitute contempt of a subordinate court \nare punishable as contempt under specific \nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_27\">Indian Penal Code</a> but not \nwhere these acts merely amount to offences \nof other description for which punishment \nhas been provided for in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_28\">Indian Penal \nCode</a>. This would be clear from the \nlanguage of the sub-section which uses the \nwords &quot;where such contempt is an offence&quot; \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">and does not say &quot;where the act alleged to \nconstitute such contempt is an offence.&quot; \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">On an examination of the decisions of several High \nCourts in India it was laid down that the High \nCourt had the right to protect subordinate courts \nagainst contempt but subject to this restriction, that \ncases of contempt which have already been \nprovided for in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_29\">Indian Penal Code</a> should not \nbe taken cognizance of by the High Court. This, it \nwas stated, was the principle underlying <a href=\"/doc/1737746/\" id=\"a_30\">section \n2(3)</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act, 1926. This \nCourt then observed that it was not necessary to \ndetermine exhaustively what were the cases of \ncontempt which had been already provided for in \nthe <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_31\">Indian Penal Code</a>; it was pointed out, \nhowever, that some light was thrown on the matter \nby the provision of <a href=\"/doc/383535/\" id=\"a_32\">section 480</a> of the Code of \nCriminal Procedure which empowers any civil, \ncriminal or revenue court to punish summarily a \nperson who is found guilty of committing any \noffence under sections 175, 178, 179, 180 or \n<a href=\"/doc/1969991/\" id=\"a_33\">section 228</a> of the Indian Penal Code in the view or \npresence of the court. The later decision of Brahma \nPrakash Sharma ([1953] S.C.R. 1169) explained \nthe true object of contempt proceedings. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">Mukherjea J. who delivered the judgment of the \nCourt said (at page 1176) : \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">&quot;It would be only repeating what has been \nsaid so often by various Judges that the \nobject of contempt proceedings is not to \nafford protection to Judges personally from \nimputations to which they may be exposed \nas individuals; it is intended to be a \nprotection to the public whose interests \nwould be very much affected if by the act or \nconduct of any party, the authority of the \ncourt is lowered and the sense of confidence \nwhich people have in the administration of \njustice by it is weakened.&quot; \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">It was also pointed out that there were innumerable \nways by which attempts could be made to hinder \nor obstruct the due administration of justice in \ncourts and one type of such interference was found \nin cases where there was an act which amounted to \n&quot;scandalising the court itself&quot; : this scandalising \nmight manifest itself in various ways but in \nsubstance it was an attack on individual Judges or \nthe court as a whole with or without reference to \nparticular cases, causing unwarranted and \ndefamatory aspersions upon the character and \nability of the Judges. Such conduct is punished as \ncontempt for the reason that it tends to create \ndistrust in the popular mind and impair the \nconfidence of the people in the courts which are of \nprime importance to the litigants in the protection \nof their rights and liberties.&quot; \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1371126\" id=\"span_4\">These two judgments have been followed recently in <a href=\"/doc/1371126/\" id=\"a_34\">Arun Paswan, \nS.I. vs.  State of Bihar &amp; Others</a> [2003 (10) SCALE 658].

The definition of criminal contempt is wide enough to \ninclude any act by a person which would either scandalize the court or which \nwould tend to interfere with the administration of justice.  It would also \ninclude any act which lowers the authority of the Court or prejudices or \ninterferes with the due course of any judicial proceedings.  It is  not limited \nto the offering of intentional insult to the Judge or interruption of the judicial \nproceedings. This Court  observed in <a href=\"/doc/1496509/\" id=\"a_38\">Delhi Judicial Service Association \nVs. State of Gujarat &amp; Ors.</a> , 1991 (4) SCC 406:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">&quot;...The public have a vital stake in effective and \norderly administration of justice.  The Court has \nthe duty of protecting the interest of the \ncommunity in the due administration of justice \nand, so, it is entrusted with the power to commit \nfor contempt of court, not to protect the dignity of \nthe Court against insult or injury, but, to protect \nand vindicate the right of the public so that the \nadministration of justice is not perverted, \nprejudiced, obstructed or interfered with.  The \npower to punish for contempt is thus for the \nprotection of public justice, whose interest requires \nthat decency and decorum is preserved in Courts of \nJustice.  Those who have to discharge duty in a \nCourt of Justice are protected by the law, and \nshielded in the discharge of their duties.  Any \ndeliberate interference with the discharge of such \nduties either in court or outside the court by \nattacking the presiding officers of the court, would \namount to criminal contempt and the courts must \ntake serious cognizance of such conduct.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">\tIn the present case, a judicial officer of the rank of District Judge was \nattacked in a pre-planned and calculated manner in his court room and when \nhe tried to protect himself from physical harm by retiring to his chambers, \nby chasing him there and causing injuries to him.  The raising of slogans and \ndemanding unconditional bail for Jokhu Singh  further compounded the \noffence.  The Courts cannot be compelled to give &quot;command orders&quot;.  The \nact committed amounts to deliberate interference with the discharge of duty \nof a judicial officer by intimidation apart from scandalizing and lowering the \ndignity of the Court  and interference with the administration of justice.The \neffect of such an act is not confined to a particular court or a district, or the \nState, it has the tendency to effect the entire judiciary in the country.  It is a \ndangerous trend.  Such a trend has to be curbed.  If for passing judicial \norders to the annoyance of the police the presiding officers of the Courts are \nto be assaulted and humiliated the judicial system in the country would \ncollapse.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\"> \tThe second contention raised on behalf of the appellants is that the \nHigh Court cannot on its own motion take action of a criminal contempt of a \nsubordinate court.  According to the learned counsels the High Court can \ntake cognizance of a criminal contempt under <a href=\"/doc/1994908/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 15 (2)</a> of the Act of a \nsubordinate court only on a reference made to it by the subordinate court or \non a motion made by the Advocate General.  Since the procedure as <a href=\"/doc/1496509/\" id=\"a_40\">laid \ndown in</a> the High Court Rules and Orders had not been followed the very \ninitiation of  proceedings for contempt was vitiated and therefore liable to be \nquashed. We do not find any force in this submission as well.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"994171\" id=\"span_6\">This point \nalso stands concluded against the appellants by a decision of this Court in \n<a href=\"/doc/994171/\" id=\"a_41\">S.K. Sarkar, Member, Board of Revenue, U.P. Lucknow, Vs. Vinay \nChandra Misra</a>, [1981 (1) SCC 436].  In this case an advocate filed a \npetition before the High Court under the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_42\">Contempt of Courts Act</a> alleging \nthat the appellant therein as a Member of Revenue Board made certain \ncontemptuous remarks, viz., nalayak gadhe saale ko jail bhijwa dunga; \nkis idiot ne advocate bana diya hai and acted in a manner which amounted \nto criminal contempt of the Court of Revenue Board, in which he (the \nadvocate) was the counsel for one of the parties.  The advocate requested the \nHigh Court to take suo motu action under the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_43\">Contempt of Court Act</a> against \nthe member of the Revenue Board or pass such orders as it deemed fit.  The \nquestion for determination was whether the High Court was competent to \ntake cognizance of contempt of a subordinate court when it was moved by a \nprivate petitioner and not in accordance with either of the two motions \nmentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1994908/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 15 (2)</a>.  Analyzing <a href=\"/doc/1994908/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 15 (2)</a> of the Act and in \nreading it in harmony with <a href=\"/doc/583891/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 10</a> of the Act it was held:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">&quot;16. <a href=\"/doc/231480/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 2(c)</a> of the Act defines &quot;criminal \ncontempt&quot;. <a href=\"/doc/1123057/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 9</a> emphasizes that &quot;nothing \ncontained in this Act shall be construed as \nimplying that any disobedience, breach, \npublication or other act is punishable as contempt \nof court which would not be so punishable apart \nfrom this Act&quot;. <a href=\"/doc/583891/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 10</a> runs as under : \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">Every High Court shall have and exercise \nthe same jurisdiction, powers and authority, \nin accordance with the same procedure and \npractice, in respect of contempts of courts \nsubordinate to it as it has and exercises in \nrespect of contempts of itself : \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">Then, there is a proviso which is not material for \nour purpose. The provision in <a href=\"/doc/583891/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 10</a> is but a \nreplica of <a href=\"/doc/1121027/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 3</a> of the 1952 Act. The phrase \n&quot;courts subordinate to it&quot; used in <a href=\"/doc/583891/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 10</a> is \nwide enough to include all courts which are \njudicially subordinate to the High Court, even \nthough administrative control over them under \n<a href=\"/doc/1345754/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 235</a> of the Constitution does not vest in the \nHigh Court. Under <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 227</a> of the Constitution \nthe High Court has the power of superintendence \nover all courts and tribunals throughout the \nterritories in relation to which it exercises \njurisdiction. The Court of Revenue Board, \ntherefore, in the instant case, is a court \n&quot;subordinate to the High Court&quot; within the \ncontemplation of <a href=\"/doc/583891/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 10</a> of the Act. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">17. <a href=\"/doc/576566/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 14</a> provides for the procedure where \ncontempts is committed in the face of the Supreme \nCourt or a High Court. <a href=\"/doc/1923500/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 15</a> is very material \nfor our purpose. It provides in regard to \ncognizance of &quot;criminal contempt&quot; in cases other \nthan those falling under <a href=\"/doc/576566/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 14</a>. The material \nportion of <a href=\"/doc/1923500/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 15</a> reads thus : \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">15. (1) In the case of a criminal contempt, \nother than a contempt referred to in <a href=\"/doc/576566/\" id=\"a_60\">Section \n14</a>, the Supreme Court or the High Court \nmay take action on its own motion or on a \nmotion made by - \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">(a) the Advocate General, or \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">(b) any other person, with the consent in \nwriting of the Advocate General. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">(2) In the case of any criminal contempt of a \nsubordinate court, the High Court may take \naction on a reference made to it by the \nsubordinate court or on a motion made by \nthe Advocate General or, in relation to a \nunion territory, by such law officer as the \nCentral Government may, by notification in \nthe Official Gazette, specify in this behalf ... \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">The operation of sub-section (1) appears to \nbe confined to cases of &quot;criminal contempt&quot; \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">of the Supreme Court or the High Court, \nitself. Criminal contempt of a subordinate \ncourt is dealt with in sub-section (2). \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">18. A comparison between the two sub-sections \nwould show that whereas in sub-section (1) one of \nthe three alternative modes for taking cognizance, \nmentioned is &quot;on its own motion&quot;, no such mode is \nexpressly provided in sub-section (2). The only \ntwo modes of taking cognizance by the High Court \nmentioned in sub-section (2) are : (i) on a \nreference made to it by a subordinate court; or (ii) \non a motion made by the Advocate General, or in \nrelation to a union territory by the notified Law \nOfficer. Does the omission in <a href=\"/doc/1994908/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 15(2)</a> of the \nmode of taking suo motu cognizance indicate a \nlegislative intention to debar the High Court from \ntaking congnizance in that mode of any criminal \ncontempt of a subordinate court ? If this question \nis answered in the affirmative, then, such a \nconstruction of sub-section (2) will be inconsistent \nwith <a href=\"/doc/583891/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 10</a> which makes the powers of the \nHigh court to punish for contempt of a subordinate \ncourt, coextensive and congruent with its power to \npunish for its own contempt not only in regard to \nquantum or prerequisites for punishment, but also \nin the matter of procedure and practice. Such a \nconstruction which will bring <a href=\"/doc/1994908/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 15(2)</a> in \nconflict with <a href=\"/doc/583891/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 10</a>, has to be avoided, and the \nother interpretation which will be in harmony with \n<a href=\"/doc/583891/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 10</a> is to be accepted. Harmoniously \nconstrued, sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1923500/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 15</a> does not \ndeprive the High Court of the power of taking \ncognizance of criminal contempt of a subordinate \ncourt, on its own motion, also. If the intention of \nthe legislature was to take away the power of the \nHigh Court to take suo motu cognizance of such \ncontempt, there was no difficulty in saying so in \nunequivocal language, or by wording the sub-\nsection in a negative form. We have, therefore, no \nhesitation in holding in agreement with the High \nCourt, that sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1923500/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 15</a>, properly \nconstrued, does not restrict the power of the High \nCourt to take cognizance of and punish contempt \nof a subordinate court, on its own motion.&quot; \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">\t\t\t\t\t\t[Emphasis supplied]\t\n\n\nWe respectfully agree with the view taken in this judgment and hold \nthat the High Court could initiate proceedings on its own motion under the \n<a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_68\">Contempt of Courts Act</a> against the appellants.  On the facts of this case \napart from the report sent by the 5th Additional District &amp; Sessions Judge of \nthe incident, Young Lawyers Association had also filed a writ petition.  The \nPresidents of the three Bar Associations and the Advocate General were \npresent and heard before initiating the  proceedings for the criminal \ncontempt.  It has been noted by the High Court that &quot;all the three Presidents \nof the High Court Associations and the Advocate General arrived at the \nconclusion that a prima facie case of criminal contempt was made out \nagainst the contemners&quot;.  This shows that the Advocate General of the State \nwas also of the opinion that prima facie a case for initiation of proceedings \nfor criminal contempt was made out and he was a consenting party to the \ninitiation of the proceedings.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">\tThe third contention raised by the learned counsel for the appellants is \nthat the standard of proof  required in the criminal contempt is the same as in \na criminal charge and therefore the charge of criminal contempt has to be \nproved beyond reasonable doubt.  That the appellants could not be convicted \non the basis of the affidavits filed.  That the witnesses should have been \nexamined in Court and in any case the appellants should have been given an \nopportunity to cross-examine the persons who  had deposed against them on \naffidavits to verify the version of the incident as according to them there \nwere conflicting versions of the incident.   It was emphasized that justice \nmust not only be done, but must be seen to be done by all concerned to \nestablish confidence that the contemners will receive a fair, just and \nimpartial trial.  We do not find any substance in this submission as well.  \nHigh Court in its order has noted that the learned counsels appearing for \nboth the parties have taken a stand that all possible fair and proper \nopportunities were extended to them.  In view of the statements made by the \ncounsels for the parties it will not be open to the counsels for the parties at \nthis stage to take the stand that in the absence of cross-examination of the \nconcerned persons, reliance could not be placed on the statements which \nwere made on oath.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1371126\" id=\"span_7\">Learned counsel who had appeared for the contemners \nbefore the High Court did not claim the right of cross-examination.  Only at \nthe stage of arguments a submission was made that opportunity to cross-\nexamine the concerned persons was not given which vitiated the trial.  High \nCourt rejected this contention by holding that such a stand could not be \ntaken at that stage of the proceedings.  It has been held in <a href=\"/doc/1371126/\" id=\"a_69\">Arun Paswan</a> \ncase (supra)  that a party which fails to avail of the opportunity to cross-\nexamine at the appropriate stage is precluded from taking the plea of non-\nobservance of principles of natural justice at a later stage.  Such a plea would \nnot be tenable.</span>  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">It has repeatedly been held by this Court (Ref: 1995 (2) SCC 584) that \nthe procedure prescribed either under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_70\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> or \nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_71\">Evidence Act</a> is not attracted to the proceedings initiated under \n<a href=\"/doc/1923500/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 15</a> of the Contempt of Courts Act.  The High Court can deal with \nsuch matters summarily and adopt its own procedure. The only caution that \nhas to be observed by the Court in exercising this inherent power of \nsummary procedure is that the procedure followed must be fair and the \ncontemners are made aware of the charges levelled against them and given a \nfair and reasonable opportunity.  Having regard to the fact that contempt \nproceedings are to be decided expeditiously in a summary manner the \nconvictions have been recorded without extending the opportunity to the \ncontemners to cross examine those who had deposed against them on \naffidavits.  Though the procedure adopted in this case was summary but \nadequate safeguards were taken to protect the contemners&#x27; interest.  The \ncontemners were issued notices apprising them of the specific allegations \nmade against them.  They were given an opportunity to counter the \nallegations by filing their counter affidavits and additional \ncounter/supplementary affidavits as per their request.  They were also given \nopportunity to file affidavits of any other persons which they did.  They \nwere given opportunities to produce any other material in their defence \nwhich they did not do.  Most of the contemners had taken the plea that at the \nrelevant time they were on duty in their respective Police Stations though in \nthe same town.  They also attached copies of station diaries and duty chart in \nsupport of their alibi.  The High Court did not accept the plea of alibi as all \nthese papers had been prepared by the contemners themselves and none of \nthe superior officer had supported such a plea.  The evidence produced by \nthe respondents was rejected in the face of the reports made by the \nAdditional District and Sessions Judge, Director General of Police  coupled \nwith affidavits of Mr. Barasi, the Additional District and Sessions Judge, \ntwo court&#x27;s officials and affidavits of some of the lawyers who had \nwitnessed the occurrence.    \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">\tThe contempt proceedings have to be decided in a summary manner.  \nThe Judge has to remain in full control of the hearing of the case and \nimmediate action is required to be taken to make it effective and deterrent.   \nImmediate steps are required to be taken to  restore order as early and \nquickly as possible.  Dragging the proceedings unnecessarily would impede \nthe speed and efficiency with which justice has to be administered. This \nCourt while considering all these aspects held in In re: Vinay Chandra \nMishra (the alleged contemner), 1995 (2) SCC 584, that the criminal \ncontempt no doubt amounts to an offence but it is an offence sui generis and \nhence for such offence, the procedure adopted both under the common law \nand the statute law in the country has always been summary.  It was \nobserved that the need was for taking speedy action and to put  the Judge in \nfull control of the hearing.  It was emphasised that immediate steps were \nrequired to be taken to restore order in the court proceedings as quickly as \npossible.  To quote from the above-referred to case\n\n\n&quot;However, the fact that the process is summary \ndoes not mean that the procedural requirement, \nviz., that an opportunity of meeting the charge, is \ndenied to the contemner. The degree of precision \nwith which the charge may be stated depends upon \nthe circumstances. So long as the gist of the \nspecific allegations is made clear or otherwise the \ncontemner is aware of the specific allegation, it is \nnot always necessary to formulate the charge in a \nspecific allegation. The consensus of opinion \namong the judiciary and the jurists alike is that \ndespite the objection that the Judge deals with the \ncontempt himself and the contemner has little \nopportunity to defend himself, there is a residue of \ncases where not only it is justifiable to punish on \nthe spot but it is the only realistic way of dealing \nwith certain offenders. This procedure does not \noffend against the principle of natural justice, viz., \nnemo judex in sua causa since the prosecution is \nnot aimed at protecting the Judge personally but \nprotecting the administration of justice. The threat \nof immediate punishment is the most effective \ndeterrent against misconduct. The Judge has to \nremain in full control of the hearing of the case and \nhe must be able to take steps to restore order as \nearly and quickly as possible. The time factor is \ncrucial. Dragging out the contempt proceedings \nmeans a lengthy interruption to the main \nproceedings which paralyses the court for a time \nand indirectly impedes the speed and efficiency \nwith which justice is administered. Instant justice \ncan never be completely satisfactory yet it does \nprovide the simplest, most effective and least \nunsatisfactory method of dealing with disruptive \nconduct in court. So long as the contemner&#x27;s \ninterests are adequately safeguarded by giving him \nan opportunity of being heard in his defence, even \nsummary procedure in the case of contempt in the \nface of the court is commended and not faulted.&quot;\n</p> \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">In the present case the High Court had decided to proceed with the \ncontempt proceedings  in a summary manner.  Due opportunity was afforded \nto all the contemners and after verifying and cross checking  the material \navailable before it, coming from different reliable sources the High Court \nconvicted only nine persons out of twenty six persons arrayed as contemners \nbefore it.  The High Court took due care to ascertain the identity of the \ncontemners by cross-checking with the affidavits filed by the different \npersons.  It is also based on the independent reports submitted by the \nDirector General of Police and Superintendent of Police.  We do not find \nany fault in the procedure adopted by the High Court in conducting the \nproceedings in the present case.  For the survival of the rule of law the \norders of the courts have to be obeyed and continue to be obeyed unless \noverturned, modified or stayed by the appellate or revisional courts.  The \ncourt does not have any agency of its own to enforce its orders.  The \nexecutive authority of the State has to come to the aid of the party seeking \nimplementation of the court orders.  The might of the State must stand \nbehind the Court orders for the survival of the rule of the court in the \ncountry.  Incidents which undermine the dignity of the courts should be \ncondemned and dealt with swiftly.   When a judge is attacked and assaulted \nin his court room and chambers by persons on whose shoulders lay the \nobligation of maintaining law and order and protecting the citizen against \nany unlawful act needs to be condemned in the severest of terms.  If \njudiciary has to perform its duties and functions in a fair and free manner, \nthe dignity and the authority of the courts has to be respected and maintained \nat all stages and by all concerned failing which the very constitutional \nscheme and public faith in the judiciary runs the risk of being lost.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">\tIt was urged with some vehemence that principles of natural justice \nwere not observed in as much as opportunity to cross examine the witnesses \nwho had deposed on affidavits is concerned it may be stated that no such \nopportunity was asked for in the High Court at trial stage.  It was for them to \nask for such an opportunity to cross examine the parties who had deposed \nagainst them on affidavit.  Since the contemners did not avail of the \nopportunity at the trial stage the plea of non-observations of principles of \nnatural justice is not tenable.  Appellants were made aware of the procedure \nwhich was adopted by  the High Court.  They were given full opportunity to \nput forth their point of view.  Each of them filed detailed affidavits along \nwith evidence in support thereof.  They had attached their duty charts \nshowing that they could not have been present at the place of occurrence as \nthey were on duty  somewhere else.  High Court has considered and \ndiscussed the entire evidence present on the record before recording the \nconviction.  The contention that the affidavits of independent witnesses were \nnot considered cannot be accepted.  Only those were convicted against \nwhom corroboration of the fact of their presence and participation in the \nincident was confirmed from more than one source.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">Plea that reasonable and adequate opportunity was not afforded to the \nappellants is equally untenable.  We find from the record that all the material \n(affidavits, show cause notice etc.) which were brought on record was \nproperly served on the learned advocates appearing for the contemners.  The \nreports submitted by the 5th Additional Sessions Judge, District Judge \naffidavit of Shri Barai and his staff, namely, R. Dass  and B. Sharma and the \nother affidavits of the advocates who had seen the occurrence and the reports \nsubmitted by the Director General of Police and the Superintendent of Police \nwere given to the learned advocates who were appearing in the  contemners \nin the High Court.  Statements of A. Natarajan, the then S.P., Harihar \nChaudhary, the then Deputy Superintendent of Police, Ranjeet Pandey, the \nthen Sergeant Major and Shashilata Singh, the then S.I. were recorded by the \nHigh Court in the presence of all the lawyers.  The Registry of the High \nCourt was directed to keep their statements in a sealed cover.  The \ncontemners were permitted to file affidavits and produced any other material \nin support of the same.  They were also permitted to file affidavits of any \nother person supporting their version.  They were all taken on record. After \naffording due  opportunity of hearing to the counsels appearing for the \ncontemners  the  High  Court  recorded  the  order  of   conviction.  Thus the \nappellants were given the evidence which had come on the record.  They \nwere given an opportunity to controvert the allegations made against them \nand produce evidence in support thereof.  Counsel appearing for the \ncontemners were satisfied with the opportunity provided to them by the High \nCourt. Plea that reasonable opportunity was not afforded to the contemners \nwas not raised before the High Court.  We are of the opinion that due \nreasonable and adequate opportunity was afforded to the appellants to \ndefend themselves and put forth their point of view.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">\tThe High Court has taken into consideration the entire evidence and \nmaterial available on the record including the evidence produced by the \ncontemners.  It was not necessary for the High Court to discuss each and \nevery affidavit individually.  Out of 26 persons named only 9 have been \nconvicted by the High Court.  Since the procedure adopted was summary the \nHigh Court has taken care not to convict a person unless direct evidence \nand/or circumstances with sufficient corroborative material doubtless \nfastening guilt on the contemners who have been punished was available.  \nThe High Court found only those contemners guilty against whom the \nelement of doubt was completely eliminated.  Affidavit evidence if based on \nhearsay has been excluded.  Contemners against whom there was single \nidentification were also given the benefit of doubt.  The version put forth by \nthe appellants was not accepted as it fell short of proof.  High Court has \nconsidered the entire evidence on the record while recording a finding of \nguilt against the appellants.  Thus the plea that the High Court did not take \ninto consideration the affidavits of independent witnesses is not tenable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_49\">Learned counsel for the appellants tried to point out that the appellants \nwere not present at the scene of incident as the appellants were on duty \nelsewhere.  He made reference to their duty charts which had been placed on \nrecord.  We find that the presence of S/Shri K.D. Choudhary, Ranjit Pandey, \nMs. Shashi Lata Singh, K.B. Singh,   Gurubachan Singh, Daroga Singh, \nPrem Kumar Singh, Rajeev Ranjan Bhagar and C.D.Jha, appellants herein \nhas been confirmed by several persons. The plea of ali bi taken by the \nappellants has been negatived by the High Court as the duty charts had been \nprepared by these officers themselves.  None of the superior officers \nsupported their versions. Presence of most of the appellants had been \nconfirmed by the 5th Additional Sessions Judge, Shri Barai, the other two \nCourt officials, advocates, the reports  of Director General of Police and the \nSuperintendent of Police.  None of these  has any interest in falsely \nimplicating any of the appellants.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_50\">\tIt is unfortunate that neither the criminal proceedings nor  the \ndisciplinary proceedings or the inquiry under the <a href=\"/doc/1788561/\" id=\"a_73\">Commission of Inquiry Act</a> \nhave been concluded.  No doubt the appellants had been suspended initially \nbut in due course they have been reinstated.  Some of them have retired as \nwell.  Inaction on the part of the authorities resulted in emboldening others \nto commit similar  acts.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1371126\" id=\"span_8\">In <a href=\"/doc/1371126/\" id=\"a_74\">Arun Paswan</a> (supra), proceedings for criminal \ncontempt were initiated against the appellant therein pursuant to the \ncomplaint lodged by the District &amp; Sessions Judge, Sasaram addressed to the \nRegistrar General of the High Court of Patna.  In the report it was stated, \ninter alia, that S.I. Arun Paswan  (contemner) was directed to produce the \ncase diary in case No. 2000/2001 under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_75\">Sections 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_76\">201</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_77\">34</a> I.P.C.   As \nthe investigation officer did not appear in the case on the date fixed the \nDistrict &amp; Sessions Judge issued notice requesting the investigation officer \nto appear personally to show cause as why he should not be prosecuted \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1797959/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 349</a> Criminal Procedure Code.  The investigation officer \nproduced the case diary and replied to the show cause notice.  The court was \nnot satisfied with the cause shown for absence and rejected the explanation.  \nContemnor was directed to remain present in the court till the rising of the \ncourt at 4.30 P.M..    A group  of persons in plain clothes as also in police \nuniforms came on the road in front of the court room of the District &amp; \nSessions Judge and started raising the abusive slogans against the District &amp; \nSessions Judge.   One of the slogans raised was &quot;District Judge  Murdabad, \nBhagalpur Dohrana Hai&quot;.  Proceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_79\">Contempt of Courts Act</a> \nwere initiated.  They were convicted under the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_80\">Contempt of Courts Act</a> and \ntheir conviction was upheld by this Court.  What is being emphasised is that \nhad timely action been taken by the authorities and the criminal proceedings \nconcluded in time, incident, as <a href=\"/doc/1371126/\" id=\"a_81\">referred to above</a>, where slogans were raised \n&quot;District Judge  Murdabad, Bhagalpur Dohrana Hai&quot; could have been \navoided.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1371126\" id=\"span_9\">The incident with which we are dealing with took place on 18th \nNovember 1997.   The incident which has been dealt with in the case of \n<a href=\"/doc/1371126/\" id=\"a_82\">Arun Paswan, S.I.</a> (supra) is dated 20th January, 2002.  Both the incidents \nhave taken place in the State of Bihar, one in Bhagalpur and the other in \nSasaram.  The manner in which the police personnel belonging to middle \nlevel of police administration and entrusted with such responsibilities as \nrequire theirs coming into contact with public day to day persuades us to \nmake observation that there is something basically wrong with the police in \nBihar.  Misconduct amounting to gross violation of discipline committed not \nby a single individual but by so many collectively and that too by those who \nhave formed an association consisting of members of a disciplined force in \nuniform was not promptly and sternly dealt with by the State or its senior \nofficials so as to take care to see that such incident, even if happened, \nremains solitary incident.  Faced with the initiation of contempt proceedings, \nthe persons proceeded against did not have the courtesy of admitting their \nguilt and tendering an apology which if done could have been dealt with \nmercy.  They decided to contest, of course the justice administration system \n\nallows them the liberty of doing  so ____ and they had every right of doing so \n____ but at the end it has been found that their pleas were false and their \ndenial of charges was aimed at prolonging the hearing as much as they \ncould.  We are shocked to learn that the criminal courts seized of trial of the \naccused persons on substantive charges for offences under the penal law of \nthe land are awaiting the decision of this appeal?  Why for?  Neither the \nHigh Court nor this Court has ever directed the proceedings before the \ncriminal Courts to remain stayed.   The criminal Court shall have to decide \non the charges framed against the accused persons on the basis of the \nevidence adduced in those cases and not on the basis of this judgment.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">Though we have found no merit in any of the pleas raised on behalf of \nthe appellants and we have formed an opinion without hesitation that the \nappeals are to be dismissed, this is a case the facts whereof persuade us to \nplace on record certain observations of ours.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">In the constitutional scheme the judiciary is entrusted with the task of \nupholding the Constitution and the laws.  Apart from interpreting the \nConstitution  and the laws, the judiciary discharges the function of securing \nmaintenance of law and order by deciding the disputes in a manner \nacceptable to civilised and peace loving society.  In order to maintain the \nfaith of the society in the rule of law the role of the judiciary cannot be \nundermined. In a number of cases this Court has observed that foundation of \nthe judiciary is the trust and confidence of the people of the nation and when \nsuch foundation or trust is rudely shaken by means of any disrespect by the \nvery persons who are required to enforce the orders of the court and \nmaintain law and order the people&#x27;s perception of efficacy of the systems \ngets eroded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">The Judges are ___ as a jurist calls ___ &#x27;paper tigers&#x27;.  They do not have \nany machinery of their own for implementing their orders.  People, while \napproaching the Court of law which they regard as temple of justice, feel \nsafe and secure whilst they are in the Court.  The police personnel is \ndeployed in the Court campus for the purpose of maintaining order and to \nsee that not only the Judges can work fearlessly in a calm, cool and serene \natmosphere but also to see that anyone coming to the Court too feels safe \nand secure thereat.   Every participant in court proceedings is either a seeker \nof justice or one who comes to assist in administration of justice.  So is the \nexpectation of the members of the Bar who are treated as officers of the \nCourt.  We shudder to feel what would happen if the police personnel itself, \nand that too in an organised manner, is found to be responsible for disturbing \nthe peace and order in the Court campus, for causing assault on the Judges \nand thus sullying the temple of justice apart from bringing a bad name to an \nindispensable organ of the executive wing of the State.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">Police is the executive force of the State to which is entrusted the duty \nof maintaining law and order and of enforcing regulations for the prevention \nand detection of crime. (Encyclopaedia Britanica, Vol.58, p.158).  The \npolice force is considered by the society as an organised force of civil \nofficers under the command of the State engaged in the preservation of law  \nand order in the society and maintaining peace by enforcement of laws and \nprevention and detection of crime.  One who is entrusted with the task  of \nmaintaining discipline in the society must first itself be disciplined.  Police is \nan agency to which social control belongs and therefore the police has to \ncome up to the expectations of the society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">We have not been able to forget the policing role of the police of \nBritish Raj wherein an attitude of hostility between the police and the \npoliced under the colonial rule was understandable.  It is unfortunate that in \none of the largest constitutional democracies of the world the police has not \nbeen able to change its that trait of hostility.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">Long back Sardar Patel had said, after achieving independence, ____ \n&quot;the police have inherited a legacy of suspicion and dislike.  For this reason, \nthere is insufficient respect for the police today.  But, now that the country is \nfree, both the public and the police must change their attitude.&quot;   Shri S.V.M. \nTripathi, former Director General of Police has, in his evaluation    &#x27;Indian \nPolice After Fifty Years of Independence&#x27;, said ____ &quot;A sensitive police \nofficer can ensure justice and fair-play as no other public servant can.  The \nleast he should  do is to prevent injustices on the poor in the society and \nother areas of administration, specially a police station.  Upholding human \nrights, and protection of life and property of citizens should be a matter of \nhabit with the police rather than that of display.  The sooner we accept this \npremise as imperative and honestly work towards achieving it, the better it \nwould be for the society and the nation.  The police leadership will have to \npush the limits of feasibility for this purpose.&quot; (The Indian Police Journal - \nVol.XLV - Nos.1 &amp; 2, at p.5). Citizens of democratic India expect the \npolice as humane and efficient, professional and disciplined.  It must be \nremembered that the task entrusted to police is onerous and the police cannot \nsucceed in fulfilling their functions without people&#x27;s cooperation and public \napproval.  Professor R. Deb, a scholar in Indian Police Service said - &quot;If law \nrepresents the collective conscience of Society, the Policeman, its principal \nlaw enforcing agent ought to be the staunchest protagonist, defender and \nkeeper of that conscience.&quot; (Police and Law Enforcement, published by S.C. \nSarkar &amp; Sons in 1988, p.1).  He quotes Shri B.N. Mallick ___ an eminent \npoliceman of his times, as saying, that a modern policeman ought to be an \nideal citizen  from every point of view.  &quot;He must be on the side of good \neverywhere, and at all times.  But to do good the policeman must himself be \ngood.  To be able to induce others to obey the laws of society, he must obey \nthem first. With his example set before them, people will flock to his banner \nnot only to seek his help and protection but also to assist him in  his noble \ntask.  He must be the leader amongst men.  This leadership  he must earn by \nhis integrity, kindness, character, steadfastness, dignity, ability and self-\nsacrifice.  He must always set the right example&quot;. Professor R.Deb&#x27;s \ndescription of an ideal police is ___ &quot;He should never forget that, like every \nother citizen he too is subject to the Rule of Law, and is legally responsible  \nfor his actions in carrying out his duties, for he who enforces law must live \nby the law.  In discharging his onerous duties and responsibilities under the \nlaw the policeman must eschew all temptations to have recourse to short-\ncuts and extra-legal methods.  He must also be absolutely honest, impartial \nand fair even to the worst legal transgressor.  In fine he must be the ideal \ncitizen and a true servant of the people in the performance of his duties \nunder the law.&quot; (ibid, p.9)\n\n\tAfter all, what the learned Addl. Sessions Judge had done.  Jokhu \nSingh had appeared as a witness.  His cross-examination was not concluded \nwithout which his testimony was liable to be excluded from being read in \nevidence.  The learned Judge had exhausted practically all means for \nsecuring the presence of the witness.  He would neither attend nor make any \ncommunication to the Court. Even the threat of initiation of proceedings \nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1396751/\" id=\"a_83\">Contempt of Courts Act</a> did not deter him from abstaining.  To \nsecure his presence a non-bailable warrant had to be issued.  He avoided the \nservice of non-bailable warrant of arrest and appeared in the Court in the late \nhours.  He was not apologetic and felt that he was above the process of the \nCourt.  It cannot be said that the higher authorities of police were not aware \nof the behaviour of Jokhu Singh.  Either they knew about it or they should \nhave known about it.  Instead of offering the bail, Jokhu Singh was busy \nmanaging for the Judge being approached or influenced by extra legal \nmethods.  Jokhu Singh and his confederate decided to take the law in their \nown hands and assault the Judge and anyone who came in their way.  We do \nnot think that any of the appellants deserve any sympathy or mercy. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">We trust and hope that this case would set in motion the thinking \nprocess of the persons occupying higher echelons in police administration \nspecially in Bihar and take care to ensure that such incidents do not recur in \nfuture.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">We direct the disciplinary authorities before whom the disciplinary \nproceedings are pending and the criminal Courts before whom the \nprosecutions are pending against the appellants to conclude the proceedings \nand the trial at the earliest.  The Commission holding the enquiry under the \n<a href=\"/doc/1788561/\" id=\"a_84\">Commissions of Enquiry Act, 1952</a> would also do well to conclude its \nproceedings at the earliest.  We request Hon&#x27;ble the Chief Justice of the \nHigh Court of Patna to watch and if necessary monitor the proceedings of \nthe Commission of Inquiry and issue directions to the criminal courts to \nexpeditiously conclude the pending criminal cases.  If the commission of \nenquiry faces non-cooperation or any obstruction in its progress, the \nSecretary of the Commission may send a communication to the Registrar \nGeneral of this Court pointing out the difficulties, if any, faced by the \nCommission and contributing to the delay in proceedings and any \ncommunication so received shall be placed by the Registrar General before \nthe Court for directions on judicial side.  The result of disciplinary \nproceedings, the judgment of the criminal Courts and the findings of \nCommission of Enquiry shall be communicated forthwith to the Registrar \nGeneral of this Court and in any case before expiry of a period of six months \nfrom today.  Copies of this judgment shall be circulated to the Registrar \nGeneral, High Court of Patna and the Chief Secretary of the State of Bihar \nfor being brought to the notice of all concerned.  Non-compliance with the \ndirections given herein may be treated as disobedience of the order of this \nCourt liable to be dealt with accordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">The appeals are dismissed.  The appellants who are on bail shall \nforthwith surrender to their bail bonds and taken into custody to serve out \nthe sentences as passed by the High Court of Patna.
