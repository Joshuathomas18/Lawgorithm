They are thus close relatives and there\nwas dispute  over a  common khal  of the  land and pahi. The\ndeceased had put an application before the Revenue Authority\nagainst the  accused and  the matter  was pending  when\t the\noccurrence took place on 8-9-1969. The deceased was attacked\nby the\taccused with  deadly weapons resulting in as many as\n27 injuries  of which  injuries 2  and 3  were grievous. The\ndeceased died  the next day in the civil hospital. The cause\nof death  was shock  and haemorrhage  and the  injuries were\nante-mortem and\t sufficient in the ordinary course of nature\nto cause  death.

(c)\t the\ncommon object  of the assembly was to cause bodily injury as\nis likely  to cause death.

The common object of the\nassembly in  the circumstances\tcan only  be said  to  cause\ninjuries which\tare likely  to cause  death which will be an\noffence punishable  under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_18\">section 304(1)</a> of the Indian Penal\nCode.

Though s. 545 of 1898\nCode enabled  the court\t only to pay compensation out of the\nfine that would be imposed under the law, by<a href=\"/doc/875650/\" id=\"a_19\"> s. 357 (3)</a> when\na court\t imposes a  sentence, of  which fine does not form a\npart, the  Court may direct the accused to pay compensation.\n[390 D-E]\n     (b) In  awarding compensation  it is  necessary for the\ncourt to  decide whether  the case  is a  fit one  in  which\ncompensation  has  to  be  awarded.  If\t it  is\t found\tthat\ncompensation should  be\t paid,\tthen  the  capacity  of\t the\naccused to  pay a  compensation has  to\t be  determined.  In\ndirecting compensation,\t the object  is to  collect the fine\nand pay\t it to\tthe person  who has  suffered the  loss. The\npurpose will not be served if the accused is not able to pay\nthe fine  or compensation  for, imposing  a default sentence\nfor non-payment of fine would not achieve the object. If the\naccused is  in a  position to  pay the\tcompensation to\t the\ninjured or  his dependent  to which  they are  entitled\t to,\nthere could  be no  reason for\tthe court not directing such\ncompensation  When  a  person,\twho  caused  injury  due  to\nnegligence or  is made\tvicariously liable  is bound  to pay\ncompensation it is only appropriate to direct payment by the\naccused\t who  is  guilty  of  causing  an  injury  with\t the\nnecessary mens\trea to\tpay compensation  for the person who\nhas suffered injury. [390 E-G]\n     (c)  The\tcourt  should\tnot  first   consider\twhat\ncompensation sought  to be  awarded  to\t the  heirs  of\t the\ndeceased and  then impose  a fine  which is  higher than the\ncompensation. It  is the  duty of  the court  to  take\tinto\naccount the  nature of\tthe crime,  the injury suffered, the\njustness of  the claim for compensation. the capacity of the\naccused to  pay the  other relevant  circumstances in fixing\nthe amount of fine or compensation.

When P.W. 3 was\n20 Kadams  away from  the place where Amar Singh was grazing\nhis cattle,  he heard  a Raula\tcoming from the side of tube\nwell of\t Mewa Singh.  Hearing the  noise, P.W. 3 ran towards\ntheir place  of the  occurrence. He  also saw  P.W. 5,\tAmar\nSingh and  Mohinder Singh,  son of Thakar Singh, P.W. 4 also\nrunning towards the place of occurrence. The three witnesses\nand Ujagar  Singh, P.W. 9 who are eye-witnesses spoke to the\nactual incident as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t  &quot;When they  reached near  the place  of occurrence\n     they heard\t Zora Singh  shouting to  Mewa\tSingh.\tZora\n     Singh was\tarmed with  a  Gandasi,\t Karnail  Singh\t was\n     holding a Takwa, Malkait Singh was armed with a Gandasi\n     and Sarwan\t Singh and  Bachan Singh were having a Lathi\n     each. Zora\t Singh gave a Gandasi blow to Mewa Singh who\n     raised his\t hands to  ward off  the blow  and sustained\n     injury. Karhail  Singh then  gave a  Takwa blow to Mewa\n     Singh which  he warded off by raising his hands and got\n     an injury\ton his\thand. Zora  Singh and  Karnail Singh\n     gave  more\t injuries  with\t their\trespective  weapons.\n     Therefore, all  the accused started causing injuries to\n     Mewa Singh\t with their  respective weapons while he was\n     Lying on the ground.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">     On the  evening at\t about 8.30  P.M., P.W.\t 14 saw Mewa\nSingh and  enquired from  the doctor whether he was in a fit\ncondition to,  make a statement. The doctor gave his opinion\nthat Mewa  Singh was  not fit  to  make\t a  statement.\tMewa\nSingh&#x27;s condition  was found  to  be  not  satisfactory\t and\ntherefore he  was moved to Civil Hospital, Ludhiana. He died\nat 5.40\t p.m. On  9-9-1969. The\t doctor noted 27 injuries on\nthe person of Mewa Singh. According to the doctor, the cause\nof death  was shock  and haemorrhage  and the  injuries were\nante-mortem and\t sufficient in the ordinary course of nature\nto cause  death. Dr.  Jagjit Singh,  P.W. 5,  examined\tMewa\nSingh on  admission to the hospital at 6.45 p.m. On 8-9-1969\nand found 27 injuries on Mewa Singh, of which injuries 2 and\n3 were grievous. Injuries at 3, 5 to 9, 11 to 17 were caused\nby sharp-edged\tweapons. All  the injuries,  except 2  and 3\nwere simple in nature.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">     The trial\tcourt was  of the view that the question for\nconsideration was  whether the\taccused intended  to inflict\nthe injuries  in question  and\tif  once  the  existence  of\ninjuries sufficient  to cause death is proved, the intention\nto cause  death will  be presumed unless the evidence or the\ncircumstances warrant  an opposite conclusion. In this view,\nthe trial  court found\tall the accused guilty under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_22\">section\n302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_23\">section 149</a> of the Indian Penal Code.

Thirdly, read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_25\">section\n34</a>, Indian Penal Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">     The facts\tof the case disclose that five accused armed\nwith various  weapons caused  the injuries  to the  deceased\nwhich resulted\tin his\tdeath. If  a person causes an injury\nwith the  intention of\tcausing bodily\tinjury to any person\nand when  the bodily  injury intended  to  be  inflicted  is\nsufficient in  the ordinary course of nature to cause death,\nthe offence would fall under clause (iii) of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_26\">section 300</a> and\nwould be  punishable under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_27\">section 302</a>\t of the Indian Penal\nCode.

It is,\ntherefore necessary  for the  prosecution to  establish that\nthe common  object of the unlawful assembly was to commit an\noffence under  <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_32\">section\t300</a>  or\t that  the  members  of\t the\nassembly knew it to. be likely that an offence under <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_33\">section\n300</a> would  be committed in prosecution of the common object.\nThe cumulative\teffect of the injuries was no doubt found to\nhave been  sufficient in  the ordinary\tcourse of  nature to\ncause death.  If the  injuries that  are sufficient  in\t the\nordinary course\t of nature  to cause  death are\t traced to a\nparticular  accused,   he  will\t be  guilty  of\t an  offence\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_34\">section 302</a> without the aid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_35\">section 149</a>,\nwhen the  injuries caused  are\tcumulatively  sufficient  to\ncause death,  it is  necessary before  holding each  of\t the\naccused guilty\tunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_36\">section  302</a> read\t with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 149</a> to\nfind that  the common object of the unlawful assembly was to\ncause death  or that  the members  of the  unlawful assembly\nknew it\t to be\tlikely\tthat  an  offence  punishable  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_38\">section 302</a>  I.P.C. would be committed in prosecution of the\ncommon object.\tIn order  to determine\tthis question, it is\nnecessary to refer to the injuries caused in some detail:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     Two grievous injuries are injuries 2 and 3 described in\nEx.

In\t the\ncircumstances we  set aside the conviction under <a href=\"/doc/179037/\" id=\"a_44\">section 350</a>\nread with  <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_45\">section 34</a>  I.P.C. but  find the  appellants\t are\nguilty of  an offence  punishable under\t <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_46\">section 304(1)</a> read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_47\">section  149</a> I.P.C.  and sentence\tthem to\t five  years\nrigorous imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 3,500/- each.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">     In this case, the death was caused by the brothers in a\nquarrel regarding  water rights.  From the  records  we\t are\nsatisfied that\tthe accused  are possessed  with  sufficient\nfunds to  compensate, at least to some extent, the loss that\nhas been suffered by the dependants of the deceased.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">     The law  which enables the Court to direct compensation\nto be  paid to the dependants is found in <a href=\"/doc/1705664/\" id=\"a_48\">section 357</a> of the\nCode  of   Criminal  Procedure\t (Act  2   of\t1974).\t The\ncorresponding provision\t in the\t 1898 Code  was section 545.\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 545</a>  of the  Code of  Criminal Procedure  (Act 5  of\n1898) was  amended by  Act 18 of 1923 and by Act 26 of 1955.\nThe amendment  which is\t relevant for  the  purpose  of\t our\ndiscussion is  525(1)(bb) which,  for  the  first  time\t was\ninserted by  Act 26  of 1955. By this amendment the court is\nenabled to  direct the\taccused, who  caused  the  death  of\nanother person,\t to pay compensation to the persons who are,\nunder the  <a href=\"/doc/594667/\" id=\"a_50\">Fatal Accidents  Act</a>, entitled to recover damages\nfrom the  persons sentenced,  for the loss resulting to them\nfrom such  death. In  introducing the  amendment, the  Joint\nSelect Committee  stated &quot;when\tdeath has  been caused\tto a\nperson, it  is but  proper that\t his  heirs  and  dependants\nshould be  compensated, in  suitable  cases,  for  the\tloss\nresulting to  them from\t such death,  by the  person who was\nresponsible for\t it. The  Committee proceeded  to state that\nthough section\t545 of\tthe Code  as  amended  in  1923\t was\nintended to  cover such cases, the intention was not however\nvery clearly brought out and therefore in order to focus the\nattention of  the courts on this aspect of the question, the\nCommittee have\tamended section\t 545 and  it has  been\tmade\nclear that  a fine may form a part of any sentence including\na sentence  of death  and it has also been provided that the\npersons who  are entitled  under the  <a href=\"/doc/594667/\" id=\"a_51\">Fatal  Accidents\tAct,\n1855</a>, to  recover damages  from the  person sentenced may be\ncompensated out\t of the\t fine imposed. It also expressed its\nfull agreement\twith the  suggestion that  at  the  time  of\nawarding judgment  in a\t case where  death has resulted from\nhomicide, the  court should  award compensation to the heirs\nof the deceased. The Committee felt that this will result in\nsettling the  claim once for all by doing away with the need\nfor a  further claim  to a  civil Court,  and avoid needless\nworry and expense\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">390</span>\nto both\t sides. The  Committee further\tagreed that in cases\nwhere the death is the result of negligence of the offender,\nappropriate compensation  should be awarded to the heirs. By\nthe introduction  of clause  (bb)  to  section\t545(1),\t the\nintention  of  the  legislature\t was  made  clear  that,  in\nsuitable  cases,   the\theirs\tand  dependents\t  should  be\ncompensated for\t the loss  that resulted  to them  from\t the\ndeath, from  a person  who was\tresponsible for it. The view\nwas also  expressed that the court should award compensation\nto the\their of\t the decease  so that  their claims would be\nsettled finally. This object is sought to be given effect to\nby section  357 of  the new  Code (Act\t2 of  1974). Section\n357(3) provides\t that when  a court  imposes a\tsentence, of\nwhich fine does not form a part, the Court may, when passing\njudgment, order\t the  accused  person  to  pay,\t by  way  of\ncompensation, such amount, as may be specified in the order,\nto the\tperson who  has sufered any loss or injury by reason\nof the\tact  for  which\t the  accused  person  has  been  so\nsentenced. The\tobject\tof  the\t section  therefore,  is  to\nprovide compensation payable to the persons who are entitled\nto recover  damages from  the person  sentenced even  though\nfine does  not form part of the sentence. Though section 545\nof 1898\t Code enabled the court only to pay compensation out\nof the\tfine that would be imposed under the law, by section\n357(3) when  a Court  imposes a sentence, of which fine does\nnot form  a part,  the Court  may direct  the accused to pay\ncompensation. In  awarding compensation\t it is necessary for\nthe court  to decide  whether the case is a fit one in which\ncompensation  has  to  be  awarded.  If\t it  is\t found\tthat\ncompensation should  be\t paid,\tthen  the  capacity  of\t the\naccused to  pay a  compensation has  to\t be  determined.  In\ndirecting compensation,\t the object  is to  collect the fine\nand pay\t it to\tthe person  who has  suffered the  loss. The\npurpose will not be served if the accused is not able to pay\nthe fine  or compensation  for, imposing  a default sentence\nfor non-payment of fine would not achieve the object. If the\naccused is  in a  position to  pay the\tcompensation to\t the\ninjured or  his dependents  to which  they are\tentitled to,\nthere could  be no  reason for\tthe Court not directing such\ncompensation. When  a person,  who  causing  injury  due  to\nnegligence or  is made\tvicariously liable  is bound  to pay\ncompensation it is only appropriate to direct payment by the\naccused\t who  is  guilty  of  causing  an  injury  with\t the\nnecessary Mens\tRea to\tpay compensation  for the person who\nhas suffered injury.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"662559\" id=\"span_6\">In awarding  compensation as cautioned by this Court in\na decision  reported in <a href=\"/doc/662559/\" id=\"a_52\">Palaniappa Gounder v. State of Tamil\nNadu</a>, the  Court should not first consider what compensation\nought to  be awarded  to the  heirs of the deceased and then\nimpose a  fine which  is higher than the compensation. It is\nthe duty of the Court to take into account the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">391</span>\nnature of  the crime,  the injury  suffered, the justness of\nthe claim  for compensation,  the capacity of the accused to\npay and order relevant circumstances in fixing the amount of\nfine or\t compensation. After  consideration of all the facts\nof the\tcase, we  feel that in addition to the sentence of 5\nyears rigorous\timprisonment, a\t fine of Rs. 3,500/- on each\nof  the\t accused  under\t <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_53\">section  304(1)</a>  I.P.C.  should  be\nimposed. The  fine will be paid as compensation to the widow\nof the\tdeceased, Mewa Singh. Tn default of payment of fine,\nthe accused  will undergo  further Simple imprisonment for 6\nmonths.</span>\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">S.R.\t\t\t\t\t  Appeals dismissed.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">392</span>\n\n\n\n</pre>","numcites":14,"numcitedby":24,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":285059,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"section 302 ipc","formInput":"section%20302%20ipc"},{"value":"sec 149 ipc","formInput":"sec%20149%20ipc"},{"value":"unlawful assembly","formInput":"unlawful%20assembly"},{"value":"section 302 indian penal code","formInput":"section%20302%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"section 149 of indian penal code","formInput":"section%20149%20of%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"common object","formInput":"common%20object"},{"value":"compensation with fine","formInput":"compensation%20with%20fine"},{"value":"compensation to accused","formInput":"compensation%20to%20accused"},{"value":"section 300","formInput":"section%20300"},{"value":"zora singh","formInput":"zora%20singh"},{"value":"water right","formInput":"water%20right"},{"value":"SUFFICIENT TO CAUSE DEATH  IN THE ORDINARY CAUSE OF NATURE","formInput":"SUFFICIENT%20TO%20CAUSE%20DEATH%20%20IN%20THE%20ORDINARY%20CAUSE%20OF%20NATURE"},{"value":"section 304","formInput":"section%20304"},{"value":"sentence of fine ","formInput":"sentence%20of%20fine%20"},{"value":"bachan singh","formInput":"bachan%20singh"},{"value":"section 149  ","formInput":"section%20149%20%20"},{"value":"sufficient cause","formInput":"sufficient%20cause"},{"value":"Grievous injuries :","formInput":"Grievous%20injuries%20%3A"},{"value":"section 357 ","formInput":"section%20357%20"},{"value":"incised wound","formInput":"incised%20wound"}],"cats":[{"value":"murder","formInput":"tag:murder"},{"value":"unlawful-assembly","formInput":"tag:unlawful-assembly"},{"value":"definition-murder","formInput":"tag:definition-murder"},{"value":"culpable-homicide","formInput":"tag:culpable-homicide"},{"value":"indian-penal-code","formInput":"tag:indian-penal-code"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
