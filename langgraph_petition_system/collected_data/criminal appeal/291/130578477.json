In   fact,   PW6   clearly \n\n\n\nstated   that   &quot;then   Mathura   was   kept   in   the   police \n\n\n\nstation   for   about   two   days&quot;.   According   to   Mr. \n\n\n\nNagendra   Rai,   learned   senior   counsel   that   the \n\n\n\ncustody   of   Mathura   being   doubtful,   the   appellant \n\n\n\ncan   not   be   connected   with   the   crime   of   alleged \n\n\n\ntorture.     He   then   pointed   out   to   a   communication \n\n\n\naddressed by              Dr. K.L. Singh, Chief Medical \n\n\n\nand   Health   Officer,   District   Shivpuri,   Madhya \n\n\n\nPradesh   to   the   concerned   Inspector   dated   29th \n\n\n\nOctober,   1983.     This   communication   was   in   the \n\n\n\ncontext of a query regarding the postmortem report \n\n\n\nof deceased Mathura, which had been addressed by \n\n\n\nthe   concerned   Inspector   on   20th  October,   1983.     It \n\n\n\nwas   stated   in   this   communication   that   on   passing \n\n\n\nelectric         current         on         scrotum,         intracranial \n\n\n\nhemorrhage is not possible.  The postmortem report \n\n\n\ndated   14th  October,   1983   clearly   stated   that   &quot;the \n\n\n\ncause of death in the case is due to coma caused by \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                 15</span>\n\n\f\n            intracranial   Hemorrhage,   which   might   be   due   to \n\n\n\n            hyper tension&quot;. It is submitted by Mr. Nagendra Rai \n\n\n\n            that  the   two   aforesaid   facts   would   clearly   raise   the \n\n\n\n            doubt as to whether the injuries were sustained by \n\n\n\n            Mathura   on   account   of   electric   shock.     Learned \n\n\n\n            senior counsel pointed out that there is evidence on \n\n\n\n            the   record   to   show   that   Mathura   was   a   habitual \n\n\n\n            drunkard.     He   was   also   suffering   from   some \n\n\n\n            dangerous   disease.     He   was   being   treated   by       Dr. \n\n\n\n            Jagdish Prasad Soni, PW18 for a number of years. \n</p>\n\n\n \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_32\">     16.    Learned   senior   counsel   further   submitted   that   the \n\n\n\n            cumulative   affect   of   all   the   evidence   raises   a \n\n\n\n            reasonable   doubt   about   the   events   as   projected   by \n\n\n\n            the prosecution.   Learned senior counsel submitted \n\n\n\n            that   the   reasoning   adopted   by   the   trial   court   in \n\n\n\n            Paragraph 20 of the judgment can not be said to be \n\n\n\n            either   perverse   or   based   on   no   evidence.     The \n\n\n\n            conclusions drawn by the trial court being plausible \n\n\n\n            conclusions   could   not   have   been   reversed   by   the \n\n\n\n            Appellate   Court.

On   the   other   hand,   Ms.   Vibha   Datta   Makhija, \n\n\n\n       learned   counsel   submits   that   the   judgment   of   the \n\n\n\n       High Court does not call for any interference.   It is \n\n\n\n       well within the findings of the appellate jurisdiction \n\n\n\n       of the High Court.   On merits, she submits that in \n\n\n\n       this case, the prosecution has presented systematic \n\n\n\n       evidence,   in   four   stages   to   connect   the   accused \n\n\n\n       appellants  with   the   crime.

According   to   the   learned   counsel,   in   this   case,   the \n\n\n\n       medical evidence is the crucial link.   She has made \n\n\n\n       detailed   reference   to   the   evidence   given   by   PW23, \n\n\n\n       Dr.   C.M.   Tripathi   and   PW24,   Dr.   L.D.

The High Court has also demonstrated \n\n\n\n       the implausibility of the conclusions recorded at the \n\n\n\n       trial court.   Learned counsel emphasized that there \n\n\n\n       is   clear   evidence   that   Mathura   was   called   to   the \n\n\n\n       police   station.     He   was   kept   there   for   two   days. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">       Injuries   were   caused   during   that   period.     Injuries \n\n\n\n       were   torturous   in   nature.     All   these   facts   are \n\n\n\n       adverted   to   by   PW6.     The   trial   court   wrongly \n\n\n\n       discarded   the   evidence   of   this   witness.     Learned \n\n\n\n       counsel then submitted that the High Court rightly \n\n\n\n       relied   on   the   evidence   of   DW1,   Suresh   Singh \n\n\n\n       Sikarwar, who had clearly stated that Mathura had \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                 18</span>\n\n\f\n                       been   called   to   the   police   station   and   that   he   had \n\n\n\n                       been illegally confined.   \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_37\">                19.    Learned   counsel   further   submitted   that   the   trial \n\n\n\n                       court   has   not   given   sufficient   attention   to   the \n\n\n\n                       evidence of the brother PW1, Takhat Singh.   It can \n\n\n\n                       not be said that he did not support the prosecution, \n\n\n\n                       merely because he stated that he had no knowledge \n\n\n\n                       about the torture.  This witness had not stated that \n\n\n\n                       Mathura was not taken to the police station.   Once \n\n\n\n                       it was established  that Mathura had been taken to \n\n\n\n                       the police station, it was for the police to explain the \n\n\n\n                       injuries   suffered   by   Mathura.     Finally,   learned \n\n\n\n                       counsel   submitted   that   in   case   of   custodial   death, \n\n\n\n                       normal rules with regard to appreciation of evidence \n\n\n\n                       can   not   always   be   made   applicable.     In   support   of \n\n\n\n                       her   statement,   the   learned   counsel   relied   on \n\n\n\n                       judgment of this Court in the case of D.K.

In   principle,   as   a \n\n\n\n                       pure   statement   of   law,   Mr.   Tulsi   is   entirely   correct \n\n\n\n                       in   the   submission   that   the   Appellate   Court   would \n\n\n\n                       not interfere with the order of acquittal, unless the \n\n\n\n                       conclusion recorded by the lower court is held to be \n\n\n\n                       perverse and has resulted in miscarriage of justice. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">                       The Appellate Court would also not interfere with an \n\n\n\n\n\n8 (1995) 4 SCC 262\n\n9 (2003) 1 SCC 534\n\n10 (2005) 9 SCC 631\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                                                    20</span>\n\n\f\n       order of acquittal if two reasonable conclusions are \n\n\n\n       possible. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">21.

It is aggravated by the fact \n\n\n\n                       that   crimes   in   custody   are   committed   by   persons, \n\n\n\n                       who   are   charged   with   the   solemn   responsibility   to \n\n\n\n                       protect   the   fundamental   rights   of   all   the   citizens. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">                       These   crimes   are   committed   under   the   shield   of \n\n\n\n                       uniform and authority within the four walls of police \n\n\n\n                       station or lock up, the victim being totally helpless. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">                       The   Judgment   further   declared   that   the \n\n\n\n                       fundamental   rights   under   <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Articles  21</a>   and  <a href=\"/doc/1293832/\" id=\"a_16\">22  (1)</a>   of \n\n\n\n                       the   Constitution   required   to   be   jealously   and \n\n\n\n                       scrupulously   protected.

We   may \n\n\n       notice here the observations made in Paragraph 16 \n\n\n\n       and 17 of the aforesaid judgment:-</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">       16...............The   High   Court   erroneously \n\n       overlooked   the   ground   reality   that   rarely   in \n\n       cases   of   police   torture   or   custodial   death, \n\n       direct   ocular   evidence   of   the   complicity   of   the \n\n       police   personnel   would   be   available,   when   it \n\n       observed   that   `direct&#x27;   evidence   about   the \n\n       complicity   of   these   respondents   was   not \n\n       available.

Bound   as   they   are   by   the \n\nties of brotherhood, it is not unknown that the \n\npolice   personnel   prefer   to   remain   silent   and \n\nmore   often   than   not  even  pervert  the   truth   to \n\nsave   their   colleagues,   and   the   present   case   is \n\nan   apt   illustration,   as   to   how   one   after   the \n\nother police witnesses feigned ignorance about \n\nthe whole matter.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">17.  From   our   independent   analysis   of   the \n\nmaterials   on   the   record,   we   are   satisfied   that \n\nRespondents   1   and   3   to   5   were   definitely \n\npresent at the police station and were directly \n\nor   indirectly   involved   in   the   torture   of   Nathu \n\nBanjara and his subsequent death while in the \n\npolice   custody   as   also   in   making   attempts   to \n\nscreen   the   offence   to   enable   the   guilty   to \n\nescape   punishment.   The   trial   court   and   the \n\nHigh   Court,   if   we   may   say   so   with   respect, \n\nexhibited   a   total   lack   of   sensitivity   and   a \n\n&quot;could   not   care   less&quot;   attitude   in   appreciating \n\nthe   evidence   on   the   record   and   thereby \n\ncondoning the barbarous third degree methods \n\nwhich   are   still   being   used   at   some   police \n\nstations, despite being illegal. The exaggerated \n\nadherence   to   and   insistence   upon   the \n\nestablishment            of         proof         beyond         every \n\nreasonable doubt, by the prosecution, ignoring \n\nthe   ground   realities,   the   fact-situations   and \n\nthe peculiar circumstances of a given case, as \n\nin   the   present   case,   often   results   in \n\nmiscarriage   of   justice   and   makes   the   justice \n\ndelivery   system   a   suspect.   In   the   ultimate \n\nanalysis the society suffers and a criminal gets \n\nencouraged. Tortures in police custody, which \n\nof   late   are   on   the   increase,   receive \n\nencouragement   by   this   type   of   an   unrealistic \n\napproach   of   the   courts   because   it   reinforces \n\nthe   belief   in   the   mind   of   the   police   that   no \n\nharm  would  come  to  them,  if  an  odd prisoner \n\ndies   in   the   lock-up,   because   there   would \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                                    25</span>\n\n\f\n       hardly   be   any   evidence   available   to   the \n\n       prosecution to directly implicate them with the \n\n       torture.   The   courts  must   not   lose   sight   of   the \n\n       fact   that   death   in   police   custody   is   perhaps \n\n       one   of   the   worst   kind   of   crimes   in   a   civilised \n\n       society, governed by the rule of law and poses \n\n       a serious threat to an orderly civilised society. \n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">       Torture in custody flouts the basic rights of the \n\n       citizens   recognised  by   the   Indian   Constitution \n\n       and   is   an   affront   to   human   dignity.   Police \n\n       excesses          and         the         maltreatment         of \n\n       detainees/undertrial   prisoners   or   suspects \n\n       tarnishes the image of any civilised nation and \n\n       encourages   the   men   in   `Khaki&#x27;   to   consider \n\n       themselves to be above the law and sometimes \n\n       even   to   become   law   unto   themselves.   Unless \n\n       stern measures are taken to check the malady, \n\n       the foundations of the criminal justice delivery \n\n       system   would   be   shaken   and   the   civilization \n\n       itself   would   risk   the   consequence   of   heading \n\n       towards perishing. The courts must, therefore, \n\n       deal with such cases in a realistic manner and \n\n       with   the   sensitivity   which   they   deserve, \n\n       otherwise   the   common   man   may   lose   faith   in \n\n       the judiciary itself, which will be a sad day.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">27.    Keeping in view the aforesaid salutary observations, \n\n\n\n       we may now examine the question as to whether the \n\n\n\n       High   Court   committed   an   error   in   reversing   the \n\n\n\n       judgment of acquittal as recorded by the trial Court. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">       It was the case of the prosecution that Mathura was \n\n\n\n       suspected   of   having   committed   theft.

He   was   kept   in \n\n\n\n       custody till 11th  October, 1983 at the police station. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">       The objective of keeping him in custody was to get a \n\n\n\n       confession   from   him   of   having   committed   the \n\n\n\n       offence of house trespass and theft. At the relevant \n\n\n\n       time,   Anil   Kumar   Singh   Kushwaha,   appellant   in \n\n\n\n       Criminal Appeal No. 584 of 2003 was Station House \n\n\n\n       Officer   of   the   Police   Station   Indar.

In   our   opinion,   the   High   Court   has   correctly \n\n\n\n       concluded that there is sufficient evidence on record \n\n\n\n       to prove that Mathura had been taken into an illegal \n\n\n\n       custody.     This   fact   has   been   adverted   to   by   PW6, \n\n\n\n       Kamal Singh. When this witness appeared in Court, \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                               27</span>\n\n\f\n       he   was   absolutely   terror   stricken.     He   categorically \n\n\n\n       stated as follows:-\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">       &quot;I will  give statement  in favour  of the  accused \n\n       persons because if I speak against them then I \n\n       will be beaten up in the police station.

That   is   why   I   am   so   frightened \n\n       that if I give the statement against the accused \n\n       persons then they will cause loss to me in the \n\n       police   station.     None   of   the   accused   persons \n\n       came to me asking for giving such a statement. \n\n       I   feared   because   my   nephew   Lalji   has   been \n\n       murdered   and   we   have   not   been   heard \n\n       anywhere.     (The   witness   was   told   that   he \n\n       would   get   full   protection   as   per   his \n\n       requirement.     Hence   tell   all   this   truth   to   the \n\n       Court).&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">29.    Upon   being   given   the   assurance   by   the   Court,   as \n\n\n\n       noticed   above,   the   witness   proceeded   to   state   that \n\n\n\n       Mathura   was   his   uncle&#x27;s   son.     He   stated   that \n\n\n\n       Nathuram, appellant No.3, had taken Mathura with \n\n\n\n       him to the police station.  He was kept in the police \n\n\n\n       station for about two days.  Takhat Singh, PW1 and \n\n\n\n       Parmal Singh, PW16 had brought Mathura from the \n\n\n\n       police  station.     He  had  talked   to  Mathura  when   he \n\n\n\n       came   back   from   the   police   station.     Mathura   told \n\n\n\n       him that Nathuram had given him severe beatings. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">       This   statement   clearly   shows   that   Mathura   was \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                                 28</span>\n\n\f\n       kept   in   illegal   custody,   as   claimed   by   the \n\n\n\n       prosecution.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">30.    Apart  from  Kamal  Singh  (PW6),   it  appears  that  the \n\n\n\n       other witnesses were also under constant pressure, \n\n\n\n       not   to   depose   against   the   police.     This   is   evident \n\n\n\n       from the fact that virtually all the witnesses turned \n\n\n\n       hostile   and   failed   to   support   the   prosecution   case. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_57\">       It   is   noteworthy   that   Shrikrishna,   PW3,   Mathura&#x27;s \n\n\n\n       brother, his widow and his son did not support the \n\n\n\n       prosecution   version.     The   terror   of   the   police   was \n\n\n\n       such that even the family members of the deceased \n\n\n\n       refrained   from   speaking   the   truth.     Takhat   Singh, \n\n\n\n       PW1,   the   brother   of   the   deceased   Mathura,   had \n\n\n\n       plucked up enough courage to state that the police \n\n\n\n       had   called   Mathura   to   the   police   station.     He, \n\n\n\n       however,   stated   that   Mathura   came   back   in   the \n\n\n\n       morning.     This   witness   had   also   stated   that   the \n\n\n\n       police   had   beaten   up   his   brother   and   he   was \n\n\n\n       rendered   unconscious.

Tripathi   and   PW24,   Dr.   L.D. \n\n\n\n       Vaswani.     Dr.   Tripathi   had   clearly   stated   that   he \n\n\n\n       had   found   two   burn   injuries   on   the   scrotum.     The \n\n\n\n       injury on the right side was 2.5 cm x 3 cm.   There \n\n\n\n       was   oval   shape   charring   of   the   skin,   which   had \n\n\n\n       become irony.  Similar wound was found on the left \n\n\n\n       side of the scrotum, which was also oval shape and \n\n\n\n       2   cm   x   1.5   cm   in   dimensions.     It   was   the   positive \n\n\n\n       opinion   of   Dr.   Tripathi   that   the   wounds   had   been \n\n\n\n       caused   by   electric   shock.     This   witness   further \n\n\n\n       stated   that   as   the   result   of   the   electric   shock,   the \n\n\n\n       brain   was   found   to   be   congested   in   aragonite \n\n\n\n       membrane.     He   stated   that   Mathura   had   died   of \n\n\n\n       Hemorrhage   of   the   vessels   of   the   brain.     This \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                                                   30</span>\n\n\f\nwitness,  in cross-examination, totally ruled  out the \n\n\n\npossibility that the injuries could have been caused \n\n\n\nwith hot  metal.    He  has clearly stated  that- &quot;It can \n\n\n\nbe   ascertained   as   to   how   the   burn   injuries   could \n\n\n\nhave   been   caused.   When   the   body   is   burnt   with   a \n\n\n\nhot object blisters are caused and if the blisters are \n\n\n\nabsent   then   the   skin   at   that   place   squeezes   and \n\n\n\nbelow   the   skin   on   the   raptor   and   on   the   muscles \n\n\n\nbecomes red.  Whereas the marks formed by electric \n\n\n\ncurrent   are   black   and   hard.   (The   meaning   of   word \n\n\n\norne   is   hard).   The   skin   also   becomes   hard   due   to \n\n\n\npost mortem burns.&quot;  During the cross examination, \n\n\n\nhe   further   clarified   that   &quot;   when   low   voltage   shocks \n\n\n\nare   given   to   anyone,   as   a   result     of   it   Brenticoolar \n\n\n\nFredania is caused due to which the heart beats are \n\n\n\nincreased   very   much   and   the   speed   of   the   heart \n\n\n\nincreases.   It   is   wrong   to   suggest   that   Intracranial \n\n\n\nhemorrhage  is not possible due to electric  shocks&quot;. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">This witness also clarified that  due to the impact of \n\n\n\nelectric   shocks   the   blood   pressure   of   Mathura   was \n\n\n\nincreased.  In view of the aforesaid, we are unable to \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                             31</span>\n\n\f\n       accept any of the submissions made by the learned \n\n\n\n       counsel   for   the   parties   that   Mathura   was   not \n\n\n\n       subjected to electric shock.   \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">32.    We   are   of   the   considered   opinion   that   in   accepting \n\n\n\n       the   evidence   of   PW6   and   the   medical   evidence   of \n\n\n\n       PW23 and PW24, the High Court has not committed \n\n\n\n       any error.  The evidence on the record clearly shows \n\n\n\n       that death of Mathura was a direct consequence of \n\n\n\n       the inexcusable and inhuman torture by the police. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">       The   prosecution   has   proved   beyond   reasonable \n\n\n\n       doubt that Mathura was taken to the police station. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">       Whilst   at   the   police   station,   he   was   subjected   to \n\n\n\n       third   degree   torture.     He   was   given   electric   shocks \n\n\n\n       in   the   scrotum.     Such   torture   was   inflicted   on \n\n\n\n       Mathura   merely   for   the   purpose   of   extracting   a \n\n\n\n       confession that he was guilty of the offence of theft. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">       Upon his release, the police personnel terrorized the \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                                                32</span>\n\n\f\n       entire family.   This is evident from the fact that the \n\n\n\n       widow,   the   son   and   the   brother   of   the   deceased \n\n\n\n       Mathura,   all   turned   hostile.     However,   there   is \n\n\n\n       sufficient   evidence   on   the   record   given   by   PW6, \n\n\n\n       PW23 and PW24 to prove beyond reasonable doubt \n\n\n\n       that   Mathura   died   due   to   the   inhuman   torture \n\n\n\n       inflicted upon him by the appellants. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">33.
