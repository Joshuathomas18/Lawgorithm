The prosecution case is that on 23.09.2000 at about\n\n06:00 pm, the appellants assaulted the deceased Raghuveer\n\nwith the weapons like lohangi (a sharp edged weapon), axe\n\nand lathi and due to the injuries caused by the appellants,\n\nthe deceased died. The criminal case was set in motion on\n\nthe report lodged by one Mathura Prasad Yadav in Police\n\nStation Kotwali, District Teekamgarh (Ex.P.-24). It was\n\ninformed that on 23.09.2000 at about 06:00 pm, when he\n\nwas returning alongwith the deceased Raghuveer Yadav\n\nafter purchasing Bidi from the shop of Ramswaroop Rai,\n\non the way, he found that the plinth work of the house of\n\nRamcharan Raikwar was being carried out and they both\n\nstood there and saw that Ramcharan Dheemar and his wife\n\nwere talking. At that time, accused Dayaram Yadav,\n\nRajaram Yadav, and Raghuveer son of Dayaram Yadav\n\narmed with lohangi and accused person Mahendra Yadav\n was armed with axe, accused Abbu @ Ramcharan armed\n\nwith lathi came at the spot and accused Rajaram Yadav had\n\nstruck on the head of the deceased Raghuveer with lohangi\n\nand thereafter, accused Dayaram, Raghuveer, Abbu and\n\nMahendra also caused injuries to the deceased with the\n\nhelp of axe, lathi, ballam etc. The injuries were caused to\n\nthe head and on both legs. The blood was oozing out from\n\nhis body. When Babu Raikwar and his wife tried to save\n\nthe deceased, they were also beaten by them, therefore,\n\nthey were terrorized. It is further informed by him that on\n\nhis shouting, other persons also came at the spot and\n\naccused persons fled away from the spot. Jagdish Yadav\n\nwas also caused injury by them when he also made an\n\nattempt to save the deceased. The report was registered by\n\nThana Incharge Shri K.R. Sijoriya PW-16. Report was\n\nmade verbally which was reduced in writing by Ex.P.-14\n\nwhich bears the signatures of the informant Mathura.\n\nInvestigating Officer immediately reached at the spot and\n\nRaghuveer was sent for medical treatment to the Rajendra\n Hospital, Teekamgarh but later he received the intimation\n\nabout his death and the said intimation was registered as\n\nEx.P.-26. Thereafter, he prepared dead body panchnama\n\nvide Ex.P.-14 and the dead body was sent for postmortem.\n\nHe also seized blood stained soil vide Ex.P.-24 and\n\nrecorded the statement of complainant Mathura Prasad,\n\nwitnesses Jagdish, Bhagwan Das, Ramcharan, Anita etc.\n\nThe cloths of the deceased were seized. After recording\n\nstatement of the witnesses, accused Dayaram and\n\nRamcharan were arrested vide Ex.P.-20.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">3.   On the disclosure statement of accused Dayaram, the\n\nweapon lohangi was seized vide Ex.P.-16 and the seizure\n\nmemo is Ex.P.-19. Lathi was seized on the discovery\n\nstatement of accused Ramcharan vide Ex.P.-18. On\n\n22.11.2000, on the discovery statement of accused\n\nRaghuveer Yadav, weapon lohangi was seized vide Ex.P.-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">5. On the statement of accused Mahendra, the axe was\n\nseized vide Ex.P.-4. The seized articles were sent for FSL.\n\nThe challan was filed against five persons. The accused\n Rajaram Yadav was absconding, he was arrested in the\n\nyear 2010 and thereafter, he was tried separately.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">4.    The accused persons abjured their guilt. Charges\n\nwere framed for commission of offences under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_7\">Sections\n\n148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_8\">302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_9\">323</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_10\">34</a> of the IPC.

One accused Shriram was acquitted\n\nout of five accused persons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">5.    The prosecution has examined 16 witnesses whereas\n\nthe defence has examined one witness DW-1 Pushpendra\n\nSingh. There are five eye witnesses, therefore, we consider\n\nit apposite to appreciate first the testimony of eye\n\nwitnesses. Ramcharan PW-1 deposed that when he was\n\nexcavating the plinth of his land, at that time, accused\n\nRajaram and Dayaram came and they started abusing him.\n\nHe went back to his house. After taking food, he came on\n\nthe road and saw the accused Raghuveer. He asked him to\n\ncome to his house and thereafter, he went to his house. He\n\nasked him to excavate and to bring the tools, get the\n Phavda for the said purpose. He started digging the earth\n\nfrom 12 O&#x27;clock till evening, thereafter alongwith\n\nRaghuveer in the evening Mathura and Raghuveer brought\n\nBidi from the shop of Ramswaroop Rai and he asked\n\nRaghuveer for smoking. Thereafter, Raghuveer and\n\nMahendra also came at the place where he was digging\n\nearth. At that time, the accused persons Rajaram,\n\nRaghuveer, Dayaram, Abbu and Mahendra came at the\n\nspot. Rajaram struck with the help of lohangi on the head\n\nand   thereafter,   all   the   accused   persons   Rajaram,\n\nRaghuveer, Dayaram, Abbu started beating Raghuveer\n\nwith the help of lohangi and Mahendra with axe. All of\n\nthem had caused injuries to the deceased. In paragraph-5 of\n\nthe statement, he states that the accused Shriram was\n\nstanding on the road with a lathi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">6.    The other eye witness PW-5 Maya, sister-in-law of\n\nthe deceased has also supported the prosecution case. She\n\nhas stated in paragraph-2 that she had seen the accused\n\npersons beating the deceased and they were armed with\n lohangi, axe and Pharsa etc.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">7.    PW-6 Janki Bai has also supported the prosecution\n\ncase and stated that she had seen the accused Rajaram,\n\nRaghuveer, Dayaram, Abbu and Mahendra beating the\n\ndeceased with the help of lohangi and axe. She had raised\n\nan alarm for the help but since the accused persons also\n\ntried to beat her, therefore, she had run away from the spot.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">8.    PW-7 Jagdish is an injured witness but he has partly\n\nsupported the prosecution case only to the extent that the\n\naccused Raghuveer has abused him and injury was\n\nreceived by him on the legs caused by Rajaram with the\n\nhelp of lohangi but he did not support the incident of\n\ninflicted injuries to the deceased by the accused persons.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">9.    PW-12 Anita is also an eye witness. She is wife of\n\nthe deceased Raghuveer and in paragraph-2 of her\n\nstatement, she has made categorical statement that accused\n\nDayaram, Ramcharan, Mahendra, Rajaram and Raghuveer\n\nwere beating the deceased with the help of lohangi, Pharsa\n\nand axe. Out of these five eye witnesses, four eye\n witnesses have made categorical statement regarding the\n\nincident and supported the prosecution case. All the\n\nwitnesses have stated that the accused persons were armed\n\nwith deadly weapons like lohangi, axe and lathi and the\n\naccused persons Rajaram, Abbu, Raghuveer and Dayaram\n\nwere armed with lohangi and accused Mahendra was\n\narmed with axe. The testimony of these eye witnesses gets\n\ncorroborated with the statement of P.W/8 Dr. Kesav Singh\n\nwho had conducted autopsy and stated that he had found\n\n18 injuries on the person of the deceased. Before the\n\npostmortem, the deceased was attended by Dr. Bhartendra\n\nKatel (PW-9) who had given primary medical aid to the\n\ndeceased and also to Jagdish prasad, therefore, the injury\n\nnos.1 and 2 received on the head were stitched. The injury\n\nno.1 was 4 cm. whereas injury no.2 was 6 cm on the\n\nparietal region. The injury no.3 was also a wound of 2x2.5\n\ncm which was along with the injury on parietal bone,\n\ninjury no.2. In the same manner, injuries no.4 and 5 were\n\nalso on the head and they were already stitched. The injury\n nos.6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11 and 12 were on the hands and fingers.\n\nThese injuries were also stitched. The injuries no.11 to 18\n\nwere also on the different parts of the body on arms, knee,\n\nthigh etc. All these injuries were found to be anti mortem\n\nand the injury nos.7, 14 and 18 were caused by hard and\n\nblunt object. The other witnesses PW-13 Bhagwandas\n\nYadav, PW-14 Babulal Raikwar and PW-15 Mathura they\n\nhave turned hostile.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">10.   The seizure of the weapons and the memorandum\n\nhave been supported by the prosecution witnesses PW-3\n\nHari Ram Tiwari and PW-4 Prabhu Yadav. The PW-4 has\n\nproved the seizure of lohangi from Dayaram, lathi from\n\nAbbu. PW-16 K.R. Sijoriya is the Investigating Officer. He\n\nstated that he had registered the marg intimation vide\n\nEx.P.-26 and prepared dead body panchnama vide Ex.P.-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">14. He also stated that he had seized blood stained soil,\n\ncloths of the deceased and had sent them for scientific\n\nexamination. He further stated that he had prepared the\n memorandum and the seizure panchnama of lohangi from\n\naccused Dayaram and seized lathi vide Ex.P.-18 from\n\naccused Ramcharan. He also stated that he had seized\n\nlohangi vide Ex.P.-5 on the discovery statement of accused\n\nRaghuveer and axe from the statement of accused\n\nMahendra. Thus, the seizure of the weapons of lohangi and\n\naxe have been proved by the independent witnesses as well\n\nas by the Investigating Officer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">11.   The counsel for the appellant argued that the fatal\n\nblow was given on head of the deceased by Rajaram with\n\nlohangi and, therefore, the other accused persons are not\n\nliable for the murder of the deceased. We have minutely\n\nexamined the testimony of eye witnesses. There are five\n\neye witnesses to the incident and witnesses PW-1\n\nRamcharan, PW-5 Maya, PW-6 Janki Bai and PW-12 Anita\n\nare consistent and coherent to the fact that all the accused\n\npersons were armed with deadly weapons i.e. lohangi, axe\n\nand lathi. They all were beating the deceased. PW-7\n\nJagdish who has partly supported the prosecution case but\n has stated that Rajaram had also caused injury to him with\n\nthe help of lohangi. PW-9 Dr. Bhartendu Kathail has also\n\nconfirmed the injury on the person of Jagdish Prasad.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">12.   Thus, the testimony of eye witnesses get well\n\ncorroborated with the medical evidence. The deceased had\n\nreceived 18 injuries and the injuries were caused with\n\nsharp edged, hard and blunt weapons. The cases of the\n\naccused persons cannot be segregated in view of the\n\ncoherent evidence of the eye witnesses corroborated with\n\nthe medical evidence. In view of the aforesaid, we do not\n\nfind any error in the order of conviction and sentence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">13.   In criminal appeal No.833/2010, the counsel for the\n\nappellant submitted that the prosecution witness PW-1\n\nRamcharan who was examined as PW-5 in the trial of the\n\npresent appellant has not supported the prosecution case. It\n\nis also stated that the prosecution has said that lohangi was\n\nseized but the same was not produced by the prosecution.\n\nThe most relevant fact that the appellant had absconded\n\nand, therefore, he was not tried in the previous trial. He\n was arrested after eight years and, therefore, the seizure of\n\nthe weapon would not have been relevant in the present\n\ncase. PW-5 Ramcharan has turned hostile but the\n\nprosecution case has been supported by the other eye\n\nwitnesses PW-1 Maya, PW-4 Anita and PW-7 Janki Bai.\n\nWe find that the testimony of these witnesses even after\n\nmore than period of eight years has been coherent in regard\n\nto the injuries inflicted by the appellant to the deceased.\n\nThus, we do not find any error in the order of conviction\n\nand sentence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">14.   Against the acquittal of Shriram, the criminal\n\nrevision No.780/2004 is filed by Rajkumar Yadav who is\n\nthe brother of the deceased. As we have already considered\n\nthe testimony of eye witnesses and other evidence in detail\n\nin the foregoing paragraphs and we find that none of the\n\nwitness has stated that Shriram was present at the exact\n\nplace of the incident and had done any overt act. In\n\nparagraph-5 of the statement of Ramcharan PW-1, it is\n\nstated that Shriram was standing on the road having a stick.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_24\">                 Apart from this evidence, no evidence is adduced by the\n\n                prosecution in respect of role of Shriram in commission of\n\n                murder of the deceased. We do not find any error in the\n\n                order of acquittal of Shriram.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">                15.     Accordingly, the criminal revision filed by Rajkumar\n\n                Yadav is dismissed. In the result, criminal appeal\n\n                Nos.539/2004 and 833/2010 as well as criminal revision\n\n                No.780/2004 are dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">                (Hemant Gupta)                      (Vijay Kumar Shukla)\n                 Chief Justice                             Judge\nanu\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">  Digitally signed by ANUPRIYA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">  SHARMA</span>\n  Date: 2018.03.09 12:14:35 +05&#x27;30&#x27;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                           Cr.A.
