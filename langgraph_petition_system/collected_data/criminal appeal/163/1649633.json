Facts which occasioned filing of those complaints are\n                              \n    identical. There is substantially no dispute about facts which are material\n\n    for deciding these appeals.     Between 24-5-2002 and 24-3-2003, the\n                             \n    complainant supplied paper worth Rs.20,38,357/- to accused No.1, whose\n\n    proprietor is accused No.2. Both the complainant and accused ordinarily do\n           \n\n\n    their business at Delhi and paper was supplied at Delhi. Five cheques of\n        \n\n\n\n    Rs.60,000/- each, drawn on Indian Overseas Bank, Delhi were delivered by\n\n    the accused to complainant towards these dues. These cheques were lodged\n\n\n\n\n\n    by the complainant for collection with his bank in Nagpur, where he claims\n\n    to have an office. The bank on which the cheques were drawn, i.e. Indian\n\n\n\n\n\n    Overseas Bank, Delhi, intimated to the complainant&#x27;s bankers that the\n\n    cheques were dishonoured, and the said bank, in turn, sent intimation of\n\n    dishonour to complainant. The complainant sent notices of demand from\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:02:58 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                          11</span>\n    his Nagpur office to the accused, which were duly received by them.

This judgment is reportedly challenged before the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n    Supreme Court by filing a Special Leave Petition on 2-2-2007 in which the\n\n\n\n\n\n    Apex Court is stated to have issued notice.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1147064\" id=\"span_6\">5.

The learned counsel for the appellant fairly concedes that\n\n    the entire transaction had in fact taken place in Delhi. However, he states\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n    that since such cases take a longer time for decision in Courts in Delhi, his\n                               \n    client chose to lodge the cheques for collection with a bank at Nagpur and\n\n    also issued a notice from an office located at Nagpur in a business\n                              \n    associate&#x27;s premises, so that he could lodge a complaint in Nagpur Courts,\n\n    where adjudication is comparatively faster.      According to him, if law\n           \n\n\n    permitted this course, there was nothing wrong in choosing a forum.\n</p>        \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1147064\" id=\"span_9\">7.

The learned counsel for the appellant is correct in contending\n                               \n    that if the learned Magistrate held that he had no jurisdiction, the only\n\n    course open to him was to return the complaint under <a href=\"/doc/454689/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 201</a> of the\n                              \n    Code of Criminal Procedure for presentation to proper Court. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1147064\" id=\"span_12\">In fact, such\n\n    is the direction in <a href=\"/doc/1147064/\" id=\"a_10\">Ahuja Nandkishore Dongre</a>&#x27;s case.

The learned counsel for the appellant next submitted that\n\n\n\n\n\n    the judgment in        <a href=\"/doc/1147064/\" id=\"a_11\">Ahuja Nandkishore Dongre</a>&#x27;s case was delivered\n\n    on 4-9-2006, long after the complaints were filed on 3-2-2004.                    No\n\n\n\n\n\n    objection had been raised to the jurisdiction of the Court till practically the\n\n    trial was over and, therefore, such objection could not have entertained by\n\n    the learned Magistrate.

The inability to take cognizance of\n                   an offence without a committal order does not mean that a\n                   duly constituted court became an incompetent court for all\n\n\n\n\n                                                         \n                   purposes.    If an objection was raised in that court at the\n                   earliest occasion on the ground that the case should have been\n                   committed by a Magistrate, the same specified court has to\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n                   exercise a jurisdiction either for sending the records to a\n                                \n                   Magistrate for adopting committal proceedings or return the\n                   police report to the Public Prosecutor or the police for\n                               \n                   presentation before the Magistrate.

That other, may, in turn,\n     negotiate the cheque in favour of third person for a liability\n\n\n\n\n\n     which that other may have to discharge towards such third\n     person.   The drawer of the cheque cannot be said to have\n     foreseen that, by such negotiation, his cheque would land at\n\n\n\n\n\n     place far away from the place at which it was meant to be\n     paid, making him liable to be hauled up in a Court at a place\n     where the cheque was presented by the holder in due course.\n     Therefore, with utmost humility and with great respect to the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                            ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:02:59 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                            24</span>\n     observations made by Andhra Pradesh High Court, it is\n\n\n\n\n                                                                     \n     difficult to deduce the ratio elicited by the Andhra Pradesh\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n     High Court, from the observations of the Supreme Court from\n     <a href=\"/doc/529907/\" id=\"a_40\">K.

The project for which the supply of stone chips and\n\n\n\n\n\n     transportation was being carried out was also within the State\n     of West Bengal.

This underlying\n     principle which forms the only authoritative element of a\n     precedent is often termed the ratio decidendi.&quot; It is by the\n      \n\n\n     choice of material facts that the Court create law. The law so\n   \n\n\n\n     created would be a good precedent for similar subsequent cases\n     unless it falls within the exceptions hereinafter indicated.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">     &quot;7.        The doctrine of precedent relates to following of\n     previous decisions within its limitations.       It introduces the\n     concept of finality and adherence to the previous decisions and\n\n\n\n\n\n     while attaining it, it creates consistency in application of law.\n     The later judgment should be similar to the earlier judgment,\n     which on material facts are the same. Finding ratio decidendi\n     is not a mechanical process but an art which one gradually\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                              ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:02:59 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                            40</span>\n     acquires through practice.

According to Sir John\n     Salmond, &quot;a precedent is a judicial decision, which contains in\n\n\n\n\n                                              \n     itself a principle.    The only principle which forms its\n     authoritative element is often termed the &#x27;ratio decidendi&#x27;. The\n     concrete decision is binding between the parties to it, but it is\n\n\n\n\n                                \n     the abstract ratio decidendi which alone has the force of law\n                 \n     as regards the world at large&quot;.       According to Austin, the\n     general reasons or principles of judicial decisions abstracted\n                \n     from peculiarities of the case are commonly styled by writers\n     on jurisprudence as &#x27;ratio decidendi&#x27;.&quot;\n</blockquote>      \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">     &quot;10       The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court further observed that a\n   \n\n\n\n     caution need to be taken while applying the principle of\n     judicial precedents as decision of the Court and its\n     observations must be read in context in which they appear. In\n\n\n\n\n\n     a judgment discussion is meant to explain and not to define.\n     In this regard, reference can be made to the case of Haryana\n     Financial Corporation and anr. vs. M/s.

Apart from the above sole\n                \n     act of presentation of the cheque before a branch outside the\n     jurisdiction of the trial court, all other acts as noticed by the\n     Supreme Court had, occurred within the territorial limits of\n      \n\n\n     the trial court itself. Their Lordships had, in the above facts\n   \n\n\n\n     and circumstances of the case, held that the trial Court was\n     not justified in refusing to exercise jurisdiction and deal with\n     the case in accordance with law.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">         &quot;19.

The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that choosing a\n\n    forum, which is convenient, is not impermissible and so the complainant\n\n    was justified in filing complaint in the Court at Nagpur. He submitted that\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_254\">                                                         ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:03:00 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_255\">                                          74</span>\n    there is nothing wrong about pre-trial harassment of the accused, and that it\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                  \n    is nowhere held that such pre-trial harassment would be a criterion to\n\n\n\n\n                                                          \n    decide jurisdictional issues.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                         \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_101\">    55.             The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that\n\n    criminal law cannot be over concerned about the rights of accused alone,\n\n\n\n\n                                              \n    and victim&#x27;s convenience and rights too are equally important. There can be\n                                \n    no doubt that a victim cannot be subjected to harassment for the sake of\n\n    securing justice. However, it does not follow that law sanctifies harassment\n                               \n    of the accused, even before he is adjudged guilty. His being required to\n\n    participate at trial is not in fact harassment, but an opportunity to defend\n            \n\n\n    himself. His participation at trial, held ordinarily at a place where he ought\n         \n\n\n\n    to be tried, cannot amount to harassment. But if he is dragged to a forum\n\n    with which lis has no concern, it would amount to either pre-conviction\n\n\n\n\n\n    punishment or a tactic of arm-twisting, which cannot be encouraged.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1293509\" id=\"span_256\">56.

The appellant did not deny or dispute any of the\n\n\n\n\n                                                          \n                   averments made in the complaint petition. In the writ petition\n                   it merely wanted some time to make the payment. It is now\n                   well known that the object of the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 138</a> of\n\n\n\n\n                                                         \n                   the Act is that for proper and smooth functioning of business\n                   transaction in particular, use of cheques as negotiable\n                   instruments would primarily depend upon the integrity and\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n                   honesty of the parties. It was noticed that cheques used to be\n                              \n                   issued as a device inter alia for defrauding the creditors and\n                   stalling the payments. It was also noticed in a number of\n                             \n                   decisions of this Court that dishonour of a cheque by the bank\n                   causes incalculable loss, injury and inconvenience to the payee\n                   and the entire credibility of the business transactions within\n           \n\n\n                   and outside the country suffers a serious setback. It was also\n        \n\n\n\n                   found that the remedy available in a civil court is a long\n                   drawn process and an unscrupulous drawer normally takes\n                   various pleas to defeat the genuine claim of the payee.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_103\">    He submitted that bearing this object in view, an interpretation which\n\n\n\n\n\n    supports the cause of payee has to be preferred. According to the learned\n\n    counsel, a trader may have transactions with several others across the\n\n    country and may receive payment for goods supplied at his business place in\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_259\">                                                          ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 14:03:00 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_260\">                                          76</span>\n    form of cheques which may be drawn on banks at several places. If he was\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                  \n    to be required to file cases at such places, he would be rather shuttling from\n\n\n\n\n                                                          \n    one court at one place to another than being in his shop. The learned\n\n    counsel submitted that this was not contemplated.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                         \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1293509\" id=\"span_261\">57.

The complainant had to simply file cases in Delhi where he\n                               \n    was supposed to be paid for goods sold by him.

The concerns of traders aired by the learned counsel\n\n    are in fact addressed by the Apex Court in para 34 of the judgment in\n            \n\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/1293509/\" id=\"a_210\">Mosaraf Hossain</a>&#x27;s case by observing to the effect that jurisdiction would vest\n         \n\n\n\n    in the Court within whose territorial jurisdiction payment was to be made.</span>\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"529907\" id=\"span_262\">58.

Today, a Delhi trial is being sought to be\n                              \n    shifted to Nagpur because trials here are speedy.         Tomorrow, money\n\n    lenders/financers may set up offices in remote areas where Courts have little\n            \n\n\n    work only in order to drag opponents to such Courts to coerce a settlement.\n</p>         \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_107\">    While laying down a legal principle all the possible implications would have\n\n    to be borne in mind. Substantive law is so drafted that no crook escapes\n\n\n\n\n\n    punishment.   But procedural law has to be so crafted that no innocent\n\n    person is victimised, or made to surrender to fait accompli, upon being worn\n\n\n\n\n\n    out by visits to Courts. In view of all this, no fault can be found with the\n\n    learned Magistrate&#x27;s conclusion that the Courts at Nagpur lacked jurisdiction\n\n    to try the case.
