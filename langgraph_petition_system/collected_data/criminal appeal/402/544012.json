In\nthe F.I.R. only role of exhortation has been assigned to the appellant. The\nappellant is 85 years of age. The submissions of the learned counsel for\nthe appellant find support from the record. In view of all these facts and\ncircumstances of the case, having regard to the nature of evidence\nadduced during trial and the probability factor, I am of the opinion that\nthe appellant can be released on bail during the pendency of appeal on\nfurnishing a personal bond with two sureties each in the like amount to\nthe satisfaction of the C.J.M. concerned provided he deposits the fine\nimposed by the trial court. On furnishing bail bonds and deposit of fine,\nthe operation of the sentence of imprisonment shall remain suspended\nduring the pendency of appeal.</p><pre id=\"pre_33\">\n2.2..2010\nTripathi\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                                                Court No. 5</span>\n                      Criminal Appeal No. 540 of 2009\nTaslim                                           Appellant\n                             Vs.\nState of U.P.

It has further been submitted\nthat injured Nirmal, who sustained gun shot injuries, had also stated that\nunknown person had        made fire on him with gun and thus there is no\nevidence to connect       Taslim with the present case. It has further been\nsubmitted that after investigation of the case final report was submitted\nagainst Taslim and he was summoned to face trial under the provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_173\">Section 319</a> Cr.P.C. and the appellant has every hope of success in appeal\nand as such he deserves bail.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_330\">            Bail has been opposed by learned A.G.A.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_331\">             Considered    the respective submissions made by the parties.\nThe contentions of the learned counsel for the appellant find support from\nthe evidence on record.
