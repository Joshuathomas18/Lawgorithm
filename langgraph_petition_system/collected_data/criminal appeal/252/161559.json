Rajasthan\tPharmaceutical\t Laboratory,   first\nappellant in  Criminal Appeal  No. 120\tof 1975 is a firm of\nwhich the  second appellant  is\t a  partner  and  the  third\nappellant is  a manager. The first appellant holds a licence\nunder the  <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_12\">Drugs and  Cosmetics Act,  1940</a> for re-packing of\ndrugs mentioned\t in the list which forms part of the licence\nand, therefore,\t is a manufacturer of the said drugs for the\npurposes of  the Act  in view  of the definition of the term\n&quot;manufacture&quot; occurring\t in <a href=\"/doc/161018104/\" id=\"a_13\">sec. 3(f)</a> of the Act. The second\nand the\t third appellant  are also  a partner  and a manager\nrespectively of the first appellant, M/s. Manoj Drug House &amp;\nothers, in Criminal Appeal No. 96 of 1975.\n     A search  of the  business premises  in Criminal Appeal\n120 of\t1975  resulted\tin  seizure  of\t sub-standard  drug,\n&quot;Sodium Bromide\t I.P.&quot; Batch No. 1 and in Criminal Appeal 96\nof 1975 of a sub-standard drug &quot;Liquid Paraffin I.P. 450 ml.\nBatch No. 1&#x27;.\n     Besides the  three appellants  in\tthese  two  appeals,\nanother partner\t of these two firms figured as an accused in\nthe complaint  but as  he was absconding the trial could not\nproceed against\t him. In  Criminal Appeal  120 of  1975\t the\nappellants were\t charged under\t<a href=\"/doc/1337149/\" id=\"a_14\">sections 18(c)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/701783/\" id=\"a_15\">18(a)(1)</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/1117043/\" id=\"a_16\">28</a> of  the Drugs  and Cosmetics\t Act, 1940  and in  Criminal\nAppeal 96  of 1975 they were charged under <a href=\"/doc/1699694/\" id=\"a_17\">sections 18(a)(i)</a>\nand <a href=\"/doc/1464772/\" id=\"a_18\">18(a)(ii)</a>.\n     The appellants  in both  the appeals  were acquitted by\nthe trial  court. But in appeals preferred by the State, the\nHigh Court in Criminal Appeal 120 of 1975, sentenced each of\nthe three  appellants to  pay a fine of Rs. 2,000 on each of\nthe counts  in default\tappellants Nos.\t 2  and\t 3  were  to\nundergo simple\timprisonment for three months &quot;for each non-\npayment of  line&quot;. For\tthe same  offences  the\t High  Court\nfurther sentenced  the third  appellant &quot;by  virtue of\t<a href=\"/doc/1874149/\" id=\"a_19\">sec.\n34(2)</a> of  the Act  to undergo  simple imprisonment for three\nmonths on each\n605\ncount and  to pay  a fine  of Rs.  500 on  each count and in\ndefault of  payment to simple imprisonment for one month for\n&quot;each non-payment of fine&quot;. The substantive sentences passed\non the third appellant were directed to run concurrently. In\nCriminal Appeal\t 96 of\t1975 the  High Court  convicted\t the\naccused under <a href=\"/doc/1699694/\" id=\"a_20\">sec. 18(a)(i)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/737933/\" id=\"a_21\">sec. 18(a)(vi)</a> and sentenced\neach of\t them to  pay a fine of Rs. 1,000 on each count, the\nsecond and  the third  appellants  were\t to  undergo  simple\nimprisonment for  one month  in default of payment. The High\nCourt further  convicted  them\t&quot;for  having  committed\t the\noffence punishable  under <a href=\"/doc/16198046/\" id=\"a_22\">sec. 22(1)(c)</a>&quot; and sentenced &quot;each\none of the accused to pay a fine of Rs. 1000 for the offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/16198046/\" id=\"a_23\">sec. 22(1)(c)</a>&quot;.\n     Allowing  both   the  appeals  in\tpart  and  remanding\nCriminal Appeal\t 120 of\t 1975 to  the High  Court for proper\nsentences, the Court.\n^\n     HELD: (1)\tThe additional\tsentence of  imprisonment on\nthe third  appellant for the same offence is illegal. But in\nsentencing the second and the third appellants to pay a fine\nonly for  the offence  under <a href=\"/doc/1337149/\" id=\"a_24\">sec.  18(c)</a>; the  provisions of\n<a href=\"/doc/12098543/\" id=\"a_25\">sec. 27\t (a) (ii)</a>  which make  a  sentence  of\timprisonment\ncompulsory has been overlooked. [612B]\n     (2) <a href=\"/doc/12098543/\" id=\"a_26\">Sec.  27(a) (ii)</a>  of the  Act makes  a sentence  of\nimprisonment of\t not less  than one  year compulsory  for an\noffence under  s. 18(c)\t in  addition  to  fine\t unless\t for\nspecial reasons\t a sentence  of imprisonment  for  a  lesser\nperiod was  warranted. Of  course, in the nature of things a\ncompany or  a firm  could not  be sent to jail but that does\nnot apply  to the  other two appellants in the instant case.\n[611E-F]\n     (3) By  virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1587628/\" id=\"a_27\">sec. 34(1)</a> of the Drugs and Cosmetics\nAct, the  appellants 2 and 3 are accused to be guilty of the\noffences  committed   by  the\tfirst  appellant,   as\t the\nexplanation appended  to <a href=\"/doc/19056/\" id=\"a_28\">sec.  34</a> makes its provisions apply\nto a firm and its partners. [611A-B]\n     (4) The  non-obstante clause with which sub-sec. (2) of\n<a href=\"/doc/19056/\" id=\"a_29\">sec. 34</a>\t begins does  not permit  the court  to\t punish\t the\noffender twice\tfor the\t same offence. It is plain that <a href=\"/doc/1874149/\" id=\"a_30\">sec.\n34(2)</a> imposes  a liability on those directors or officers of\nthe company who are not directly in charge of the management\nof the company and as such could not be held guilty with the\nhelp of\t sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/19056/\" id=\"a_31\">sec.34</a>, if they were responsible\nfor the commission of the offences by consent, connivance or\nneglect. It  would be  incongruous if  a  man  found  to  be\ndirectly responsible for the commission of the offence could\nat the\tsame time  be held  guilty of  contributing  to\t the\ncommission of  the offence  by his  consent,  connivance  or\nneglect. [611 B-C]\n     There is  nothing in the language of <a href=\"/doc/19056/\" id=\"a_32\">sec. 34</a> to warrant\na construction,\t that the  words &quot;punished  accordingly&quot;  in\nclause (2)  of <a href=\"/doc/19056/\" id=\"a_33\">sec.  34</a> of  the Act  mean that\tthe  persons\nmentioned therein  can be punished only in the same way as a\ncompany would  be punishable,  that is, only with a fine and\nnot with  an imprisonment.  The words &quot;punished accordingly&quot;\nin the\tcontext mean that a person deemed to be guilty of an\noffence committed  by a company shall receive the punishment\nthat is prescribed by the Act for that offence. [611G]\n     The State\tof Maharashtra\tv. Joseph  Anthony  Pereira,\n(1971) 73 B.L.R. 613, overruled.\n606\n     (6) For  the contravention\t of provisions\tof <a href=\"/doc/331061/\" id=\"a_34\">sec. 18A</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/1117043/\" id=\"a_35\">sec. 28</a>\t prescribed imprisonment for a term which may extend\nto one\tyear or\t with fine  which may extend to five hundred\nrupees or  with both. Clearly therefore no fine in excess of\nfive hundred  rupees could  be imposed\tfor an offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/331061/\" id=\"a_36\">sec. 18A</a>.  The imposition  of a\t fine of  Rs. 2,000  for the\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/331061/\" id=\"a_37\">sec. 18A</a> which is punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1117043/\" id=\"a_38\">sec. 28</a>, in\nthe instant case, is not in order. [611H]\n     (7) The  plea of ignorance of the nature, sub-stance or\nquality of the drug in view of the fact that accused got the\nsupplies  of   these   drugs   from   the   firm   Rajasthan\nPharmaceutical Laboratory,  who are the packers, is not only\nnot covered  by sub-sec.  (2)  and  (3)\t of  <a href=\"/doc/1546581/\" id=\"a_39\">sec.  19</a>  which\nenumerate the  cases in which general rule continued in sub-\nsec. (1)  would not  apply,  but  also\tfactually  incorrect\nbecause appellants  2 and  3 in\t Criminal Appeal 96 of 1975,\nare respectively  a partner  and the  manager  of  both\t the\nfirms, Rajasthan  Pharmaceutical Laboratory  and Manoj\tDrug\nHouse. [613 F-H]\n     (8) <a href=\"/doc/16198046/\" id=\"a_40\">Sec.  22(1)(c)</a> does  not  provide  for\t a  separate\npunishment. Rule 54A of the rules framed under the <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_41\">Drugs and\nCosmetics Act</a>  prohibits contravention\tof  the\t prohibitory\norder made  under <a href=\"/doc/16198046/\" id=\"a_42\">sec.\t22(1)(c)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/17969805/\" id=\"a_43\">sec. 27(b)</a> itself makes\nsuch contravention punishable with imprisonment or with fine\nor with both.

The first appellant M/s. Rajasthan Pharmaceutical\nLaboratory is  a firm  of which\t the second  appellant is  a\npartner and  the third\tappellant is  the Manager. The first\nappellant holds\t a licence  under the  Act for\trepacking of\ndrugs mentioned in the list which forms part of the licence.\nFor  purposes\tof  the\t  Act  the   first  appellant  is  a\nmanufacturer of\t the said drugs in view of the definition of\nthe term  &#x27;manufacture&#x27; occurring in <a href=\"/doc/161018104/\" id=\"a_46\">section 3(f)</a> of the Act\nwhich is as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t  &quot;manufacture in  relation to\tany drug or cosmetic\n     includes any  process or  part of a process for making,\n     altering, ornamenting,  finishing, packing,  labelling,\n     breaking up  or otherwise treating or adopting any drug\n     or cosmetic  with a  view to  its sale and distribution\n     but does  not include  the compounding or dispensing of\n     any drug, or the packing of any drug or cosmetic in the\n     ordinary\tcourse\t of   retail   business;   and\t &#x27;to\n     manufacture&#x27; shall be construed accordingly;&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">On February 27, 1970 on a search of the business premises of\nthe first  appellant, a\t Drugs Inspector  seized 42 items of\ndrugs from a room, 33 of which were not in the approved list\nof drugs  appended  to\tthe  licence  issued  to  the  first\nappellant. The\tthird appellant\t who is\t the Manager  of the\nfirm and  was present  during the  search failed to disclose\nthe source  from which\tthese drugs  had been acquired. To a\nnotice issued  under <a href=\"/doc/331061/\" id=\"a_47\">section 18A</a> of the Act calling upon the\nfirst appellant to disclose the source of acquisition of the\ndrugs seized,  the reply,  signed by  the third appellant on\nbehalf of  the firm, was a denial of the fact that the drugs\nwere found  in their  possession and  that they were seized.\nSamples were  taken from the seized drugs which were sent to\nthe Government Analyst and from his report it was found that\none of\tthe drugs,  Sodium Bromide I.P. Batch No. 1 was sub-\nstandard. On the aforesaid facts the Drugs Inspector filed a\ncomplaint in  the court\t of the\t Judicial Magistrate,  First\nClass (4th  Court), Bangalore  alleging that  the appellants\nbefore us  were guilty\tof having  committed offences  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1337149/\" id=\"a_48\">sections 18(c)</a>,\t <a href=\"/doc/1699694/\" id=\"a_49\">18(a)(i)</a> and  <a href=\"/doc/331061/\" id=\"a_50\">18A</a>  punishable\trespectively\nunder <a href=\"/doc/12098543/\" id=\"a_51\">sections\t27(a)(ii)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/17969805/\" id=\"a_52\">27(b)</a>  and <a href=\"/doc/1117043/\" id=\"a_53\">28</a> of the Act. Another\npartner of  the firm  also figured  as\tan  accused  in\t the\ncomplaint but as he was absconding the trial could\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">608</span>\nnot proceed  against him.  As already  stated the magistrate\nacquitted the appellants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">     On the facts on record the High Court found:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     (a) 33  out of  the 42  items of  drugs seized from the\nbusiness premises  of the  first appellant  do not figure in\nthe approved  list of  drugs which forms part of the licence\nissued to  the first appellant. These 33 items had been kept\nin the premises for sale without the requisite licence. This\nconstitutes an\toffence under  section 18(c)  of the Act for\nwhich all  the appellants are punishable under section 27(a)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(ii).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     (b) Of  the samples of the drugs seized and sent to the\nGovernment Analyst, one sample of Sodium Bromide I. P. Batch\nNo. 1 was found to be sub-standard. An offence under <a href=\"/doc/1699694/\" id=\"a_54\">section\n18 (a)\t(i)</a> has\t therefore  been  committed  for  which\t the\nappellants are punishable under <a href=\"/doc/17969805/\" id=\"a_55\">section 27(b)</a>.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">     (c) The  appellants failed\t to disclose  the source  of\nacquisition of\tthe aforesaid  33 items\t of drugs which were\nnot in\tthe approved list. This constitutes an offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/331061/\" id=\"a_56\">section 18A</a>  which makes  the  appellants  punishable  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1117043/\" id=\"a_57\">section 28</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">     For these offences the High Court sentenced each of the\nthree appellants  to pay  a fine  of Rs. 2000 on each of the\ncounts, in  default appellants\tnos. 2 and 3 were to undergo\nsimple imprisonment  for three\tmonths &#x27;for each non-payment\nof fine&#x27;.

In  view  of\t the\nexplanation appended to <a href=\"/doc/19056/\" id=\"a_71\">section 34</a> its provisions will apply\nto a  firm and\tits partners.  But having  found  the  third\nappellant guilty  with the aid of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/19056/\" id=\"a_72\">section\n34</a>, the\t High Court  appears to\t have misdirected  itself in\nthinking that the non-obstante clause with which sub-section\n(2) of\tthe section begins permitted the court to punish the\nappellant twice\t for the  same offence.\t It  is\t plain\tthat\n<a href=\"/doc/1874149/\" id=\"a_73\">section 34(2)</a>  imposes a  liability on\tthose  directors  or\nofficers of  the company  who were not directly in charge of\nthe management\tof the company and as such could not be held\nguilty with  the help  of sub-section  (1) of <a href=\"/doc/19056/\" id=\"a_74\">section 34</a>, if\nthey were  responsible for  the commission of the offence by\nconsent, connivance  or neglect.  It would  also be a little\nincongruous if\ta man  found to\t be directly responsible for\nthe commission of the offence could at the same time be held\nguilty of  contributing to  the commission of the offence by\nhis consent,  connivance or  neglect. The further punishment\nawarded to the third appellant with the aid of <a href=\"/doc/1874149/\" id=\"a_75\">section 34(2)</a>\nis therefore  set aside.  But this  does  not  conclude\t the\nmatter. The High Court imposed a fine of two thousand rupees\non each\t of the\t three\tappellants  for\t the  offence  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1337149/\" id=\"a_76\">section 18(c)</a>.\t<a href=\"/doc/12098543/\" id=\"a_77\">Section\t 27(a)\t(ii)</a>  makes  a\tsentence  of\nimprisonment of\t not less  than one year compulsory for such\noffence in  addition to\t fine unless  for special  reasons a\nsentence of  imprisonment for a lesser period was warranted.\nOf course  in the nature of things a company or a firm could\nnot be sent to jail but that does not apply to the other two\nappellants. Mr.\t Sen referred  to a  decision of  the Bombay\nHigh Court reported in (1971) 73 B.L.R. 613 which holds that\nthe words &quot;punished accordingly&quot; in clause (2) of <a href=\"/doc/19056/\" id=\"a_78\">section 34</a>\nof the\tAct mean  that the  persons mentioned therein can be\npunished only  in  the\tsame  way  as  a  company  would  be\npunishable,  that   is,\t only  with  a\tfine  and  not\twith\nimprisonment. We  are unable  to agree.\t There is nothing in\nthe language  of <a href=\"/doc/19056/\" id=\"a_79\">section  34</a> to warrant such a construction.\nIt seems  clear to  us that the words &quot;punished accordingly&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">in the\tcontext mean that a person deemed to be guilty of an\noffence committed  by a company shall receive the punishment\nthat is\t prescribed by\tthe Act for that offence. It appears\nthat the  High Court was also in error in imposing a fine of\ntwo thousand  rupees for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/331061/\" id=\"a_80\">section 18A</a> which\nis punishable  under <a href=\"/doc/1117043/\" id=\"a_81\">section  28</a>. For  the contravention  of\nprovisions   of\t  <a href=\"/doc/331061/\" id=\"a_82\">section   18A</a>,   <a href=\"/doc/1117043/\" id=\"a_83\">section   28</a>\t  prescribes\nimprisonment for a term which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">612</span>\nmay extend to one year or with fine which may extend to five\nhundred rupees\tor with\t both. Clearly\ttherefore no fine in\nexcess of  five hundred\t rupees\t could\tbe  imposed  for  an\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/331061/\" id=\"a_84\">section 18A</a>.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">     In the  result, while maintaining the conviction of the\nappellants, we\tremit the  case to  the High Court; the High\nCourt will  consider again  on the findings already recorded\nthe question  of sentence-(a)  for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1337149/\" id=\"a_85\">section\n18(c)</a>  punishable   under  <a href=\"/doc/12098543/\" id=\"a_86\">section  27(a)  (ii)</a>\t so  far  as\nappellants 2  and 3  are concerned,  and (b) for the offence\npunishable  under   <a href=\"/doc/1117043/\" id=\"a_87\">section  28</a>\t  of  which  all  the  three\nappellants have\t been  found  guilty,-and  pass\t appropriate\nsentences.

On  July 17, 1970 the Assistant Drug Controller for\nthe State  of Mysore  who had  been appointed  as  Inspector\nunder <a href=\"/doc/379129/\" id=\"a_91\">section 21</a> of the Act took samples of &quot;Liquid Paraffin\nI.P.&quot; Batch  I, and  &quot;Formaline I.P.&quot;  Batch 1 which, as the\nlabels on  these drugs\tshowed, had  been repacked  by\tM/s.\nRajasthan Pharmaceutical  Laboratory, the first appellant in\nthe other case. The Inspector sent the samples to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">613</span>\nGovernment Analyst  and the  report received from him showed\nthat the products were not of standard quality. On September\n9, 1970\t the Drugs Inspector, Bangalore Division, found that\nthe firm  M/s. Manoj  Drug House  was  exhibiting  for\tsale\nstocks\tof  the\t drugs\twhich  the  Government\tAnalyst\t had\ndeclared as  not of standard quality. He therefore issued an\norder under <a href=\"/doc/16198046/\" id=\"a_92\">section 22(1)(c)</a> of the Act prohibiting the sale\nof the\tsaid drugs  for a  certain period which was extended\nfrom time  to time.  On October 28, 1970 the Inspector asked\nthe third  appellant who  was the  Manager of  the  firm  to\nproduce the  stock of  the prohibited  drugs. The  Inspector\nseized the  stock produced  before him but this was found to\nbe short by 57 bottles of Liquid Paraffin I.P. 450 ml. Batch\nNo. 1.\tOn these facts a complaint was filed in the court of\nthe City  Magistrate, Bangalore alleging that the appellants\nwere guilty  of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1699694/\" id=\"a_93\">section 18(a)(i)</a> of the Act\nfor having  in their stock and exhibiting for sale drugs not\nof standard  quality and further that they were guilty of an\noffence\t under\t <a href=\"/doc/737933/\" id=\"a_94\">section  18(a)(vi)</a>  for  disposing  of\t the\naforesaid quantities  of Liquid Paraffin I.P.

The trial court acquitted the accused but on appeal\npreferred by the State of Karnataka the High Court set aside\nthe order  of acquittal\t and  convicted\t the  accused  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1699694/\" id=\"a_97\">section 18(a)(i)</a>  and <a href=\"/doc/737933/\" id=\"a_98\">section  18(a)(vi)</a>, and sentenced each\nof the\taccused to  pay a fine of Rs. 1000/- on each count :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">the second  and the  third appellants were to undergo simple\nimprisonment for  one month in default of payment. We see no\nreason to  interfere with  the findings\t of fact recorded by\nthe High Court. The only point argued before us on behalf of\nthe appellants\twhich was  also urged  in the High Court was\nthat they  got the  supplies of\t these drugs  from the\tfirm\nRajasthan Pharmaceutical Laboratory who were the packers and\nthe appellants\tdid  not  know\tthat  the  drugs  were\tsub-\nstandard. The  High Court  rightly pointed out that this did\nnot constitute\ta valid\t defence in view of <a href=\"/doc/950093/\" id=\"a_99\">section 19(1)</a> of\nthe Act which is as follows.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">     &quot;19.
