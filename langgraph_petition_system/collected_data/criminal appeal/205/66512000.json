The accused were committed to the sessions court\n\nwhere the charges were framed against the accused and the\n\nappellants-accused pleaded not guilty. To bring home the guilt\n\nof the accused, the prosecution has examined 38 witnesses and\n\nexhibited number of     documents and material objects.    Upon\n\nappreciation of   evidence, the learned Sessions Court vide its\n\njudgment     dated 26.7.2011 and 29.7.2011 convicted the\n\nappellants   A1 to A3 for offences under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 302</a> IPC and\n\nsentenced them       to death. Appellants A1 to A3 were also\n\nconvicted for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1284610/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 376(2)(g)</a> IPC and each of\n\nthem were sentenced to undergo life imprisonment with fine of\n\nRs.5,000/- each with default clause.

For the\n\nconviction under <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 25(1)(a)(b)</a> of the Arms Act, appellants\n\n1 to 3 were sentenced to undergo imprisonment for three years\n\nand to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- each with default clause.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">6.        For confirmation of death sentence     imposed on the\n\nappellants 1 to 3, State preferred Death Reference No.3/2011\n\nbefore the Calcutta High Court. Assailing the correctness of their\n\nconviction and sentence, accused 1 to 3 preferred           criminal\n\nappeal 471/2011 and fourth accused preferred criminal appeal\n\n484/2011. The High Court partly allowed the appeal by setting\n\naside the conviction under <a href=\"/doc/1284610/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 376(2)(g)</a> IPC and for         the\n\nconviction under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 302</a> IPC modified the sentence            of\n\ndeath to life imprisonment.       High Court      confirmed the\n\nconviction of fourth accused Durga Sutradhar under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_18\">Section\n\n120B</a> IPC and sentence of life imprisonment imposed on her. In\n\nthese appeals,    the appellants-accused      1 to 4 assail the\n\ncorrectness of the impugned judgment of the High Court.\n\nInvolvement of A-1 and his conviction:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"260813\" id=\"span_12\">7.        As against Kiriti Pal (A-1) prosecution case is that he\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                   7</span>\n\nhatched criminal conspiracy along with Siddique Mia                    (A-2),\n\nMustaque Mia (A-3) and Durga Sutradhar (A-4) to commit the\n\nmurder of deceased-Anjali Goswami. Prosecution case is based\n\non     circumstantial evidence.        It is well-settled    that in cases\n\nwhere the evidence is purely circumstantial in nature, the\n\ncircumstances from which the conclusion of guilt is sought to\n\nbe drawn must be fully established beyond                   any reasonable\n\ndoubt and such circumstances must be consistent and must\n\nform    a complete chain       unerringly      point to the guilt of the\n\naccused and the chain of circumstances must be established by\n\nthe prosecution.

He will take her later”     and    by saying so first\n\nappellant Kiriti Pal left the place.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">13.             Anjali was last seen        in the company of first\n\nappellant   is also spoken by PW10- Manas Chakraborty who\n\ndeposed that on 11.11.2008 at about 5.35 p.m. when he was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                             12</span>\n\nentering into his house from office, Anjali was found sitting on\n\nthe verandah of the first floor and PW 10 asked her to give rent.\n\nAfter going inside his house, PW10 while taking tea          on the\n\nverandah, Anjali was getting down from the beauty parlour\n\nand again PW10-Manash Chakraborty asked Anjali for rent and\n\nAnjali showing her hand     stated that ‘she was coming’.     PW10\n\nstated   that   he saw Anjali going   as the pillion rider   in the\n\nmotor cycle and that the motor cyclist was a man aged 50 years\n\nwho was of medium physique, scanty hair on his head.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">14.       From the evidence of PWs 6, 7 and 10, prosecution\n\nhas thus established    that Anjali   was last seen alive in the\n\ncompany of       first appellant Kiriti Pal on the evening of\n\n11.11.2008 and that at about 10.00/10.30 p.m., first appellant\n\nKiriti Pal came alone. The theory of “last seen alive” comes into\n\nplay when the time gap between the way the accused and the\n\ndeceased were last seen together and the deceased was found\n\ndead     was so small, the possibility of      any other person\n\ncommitting the murder becomes impossible. On the next day\n\nmorning at about 9.30 a.m., body of deceased Anjali was found\n\nin Babuibona jungle an isolated place which is 25 k.m. away\n\nfrom her residence.    The place where the dead body was found\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                13</span>\n\nwas connected with Rajnagar - Suri Road.           The time     when\n\nAnjali left with first appellant-Kiriti Pal and the time she was\n\nfound dead is so proximate which, in our view, points to the\n\nguilt of the first appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">15.         Having regard to the time gap       being small, it is for\n\nthe first appellant to explain the circumstances how and where\n\nand in what manner he parted company with Anjali. Thus, on\n\nthe principle that the person who is last found in the company\n\nof another is dead or missing, the person with whom he was\n\nlast found alive has to explain the circumstances in which he\n\nparted the company as pointed out by the trial court and the\n\nHigh Court, first appellant has failed to discharge the onus and\n\nfailed to offer any explanation as to how, as to when and how\n\nand in   what manner he parted       the company of Anjali,      is a\n\nstrong militating circumstance against the first appellant-Kiriti\n\nPal. There is force in the submission of the learned counsel for\n\nthe State that the first appellant-Kiriti Pal    failed to offer any\n\nexplanation, it must be held that he failed to discharge the\n\nburden cast upon him by <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 106</a> of the Evidence Act.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1789800\" id=\"span_24\">In\n\nthe case of      <a href=\"/doc/1789800/\" id=\"a_26\">State of U.P. vs. Satish</a> (2005) 3 SCC 114, this\n\nCourt had stated the last seen theory comes into play where the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                14</span>\n\ntime-gap between the point of time when the accused and the\n\ndeceased were last seen alive and when the deceased is found\n\ndead is so small that possibility of any person other than the\n\naccused being the author of the crime becomes impossible.</span>               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"116940\" id=\"span_26\">In\n\n<a href=\"/doc/116940/\" id=\"a_27\">State of Rajasthan vs. Kashi Ram</a>, (2006)             12    SCC 254, in\n\nparagraph 23, this Court has held as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                “It is not necessary to multiply with authorities.\n          The principle is well settled.

Thus, if a person is last seen with\n          the deceased, he must offer an explanation as to how\n          and when he parted company. He must furnish an\n          explanation which appears to the court to be probable\n          and satisfactory. If he does so he must be held to have\n          discharged his burden. If he fails to offer an explanation\n          on the basis of facts within his special knowledge, he\n          fails to discharge the burden cast upon him by <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n          106</a> of the Evidence Act.

Section\n          106 does not shift the burden of proof in a criminal trial,\n          which is always upon the prosecution.

Learned counsel for the first appellant    contended\n\nthat no motive is attributed to the accused and merely because\n\nthe first appellant had developed friendship and intimacy with\n\nAnjali Goswami, in the absence of any motive attributed, the\n\ncourts below erred in convicting the first appellant.    It is true\n\nthat motive      is an important      factor in cases where    the\n\nconviction is based on circumstantial evidence but that does\n\nnot mean in all cases of circumstantial evidence if prosecution\n\nis unable to     prove the motive satisfactorily, the prosecution\n\nmust fail. In this case, of course, prosecution has not adduced\n\nevidence as to what was the motive for committing murder of\n\nAnjali.   But it is a matter of common knowledge that murders\n\nhave been committed without any pro-eminent motive. It is well\n\nestablished that the mere fact that the prosecution has failed to\n\ntranslate the mental disposition of the accused into evidence,\n\nthat does not mean that no such mental condition existed in\n\nthe mind of the accused.       Same view was reiterated in <a href=\"/doc/29060748/\" id=\"a_31\">Vivek\n\nKalra vs. State of Rajasthan</a>, (2014) 12 SCC 439, it was observed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">\f                                19</span>\n\nthus:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">           “17…where prosecution          relies on circumstantial\n           evidence only, motive is a relevant fact and can be taken\n           into consideration under <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 8</a> of the Indian\n           Evidence Act, 1872 but where          the chain of other\n           circumstances establishes beyond reasonable doubt that\n           it is the accused and the accused alone who has\n           committed the offence, and this is one such case, the\n           Court cannot hold that in the absence of motive of the\n           accused being established by the prosecution, the\n           accused cannot be held guilty of the offence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"186059\" id=\"span_33\">In <a href=\"/doc/186059/\" id=\"a_33\">Ujjagar\n           Singh vs. State of Punjab</a> (2007) 13 SCC 90, this Court\n           observed: (SCC P.99 para 17)\n\n              “17…..It is true    that in a case relating to\n              circumstantial evidence motive does assume great\n              importance but to say that the absence of motive\n              would dislodge the entire prosecution story is\n              perhaps giving this one factor an importance\n              which is not due and (to use the cliché) the\n              motive is in the mind of the accused and can\n              seldom be fathomed with any degree of accuracy.””</span>\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">22.       The circumstances relied         upon by     the prosecution\n\nagainst the first appellant Kiriti Pal are well established by the\n\nprosecution. Upon appreciation of evidence, the trial court and\n\nthe High Court            rightly held       that the incriminating\n\ncircumstances against the first appellant Kiriti Pal are firmly\n\nestablished and form a complete chain pointing to the guilt of\n\nthe accused and are consistent with the hypothesis of the guilt\n\nof the first appellant.       We find no substantial ground            to\n\ninterfere with the conviction of the first appellant Kiriti Pal under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 302</a> IPC. Insofar as the charge           of rape is concerned,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">\f                                 20</span>\n\nwe agree with the      view of the High Court        that there is no\n\npositive evidence for sustaining the conviction under <a href=\"/doc/1284610/\" id=\"a_35\">Section\n\n376(2)(g)</a> IPC. The conviction of the first appellant Kiriti Pal\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 25(i)(a) (b)</a> of Arms Act and the sentence imposed\n\non him is confirmed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">Involvement of A-2, A-3 and A-4 and their conviction.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">23.         For conviction of appellants A-2, A-3 and A-4, courts\n\nbelow relied upon two circumstances:- (i) that soon before             the\n\ntime of incident and after the incident all the accused were in\n\ncontact with each other on the phone calls and thus                    had\n\nconspired    in   perpetrating        the   crime;   (ii)   recovery    of\n\nincriminating articles from appellants 2 and 3.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">24.         To arrive at a conclusion that the accused-appellants\n\nhave conspired together to commit the offence, courts below\n\nmainly relied upon the phone calls details. Ext.30 is the call\n\nrecord of mobile No.9232589186 of Kiriti Pal which shows that\n\nKiriti Pal made 41 calls to A4 Durga Sutradhar from 7.12.2008\n\nto 15.1.2009. Ext.31 is the call record of Siddique Mia.        Ext. 31\n\nindicates that 144 calls were made from the mobile phone of\n\nMustaque Mia to Siddique Mia. Some of the calls were incoming\n\ncalls from the mobile of Siddique Mia to Mustaque Mia. Ext.31\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">\f                              21</span>\n\nindicates   that there was telephonic conversation between the\n\naccused     Musatque Mia and accused Siddique Mia. Ext.32\n\nshows that    Kiriti Pal gave 7     calls to Anjali’s    mobile   from\n\n11.7.2008 to 9.11.2008.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">Ext.34 shows Saraswati gave 7 calls to Siddique Mia during the\n\nperiod from 11.11.2008 to 14.11.2008. Documentary evidence\n\nindicates that Siddique Mia made 13 calls to Saraswati during\n\nthe period from 10.11.2008 to 27.11.2008. Ext.35 shows that\n\nSaraswati gave 38 calls to Durga Sutradhar during the period\n\nfrom 11.11.2008 to 20.11.2008.         Documentary evidence       also\n\nindicates that all the accused were in contact with one another\n\nover the phone.    Scrutiny       of call details   revealed that on\n\n11.11.2008 Saraswati gave 2 calls to Anjali. One call was at\n\n12.55 hours and another call         was at 12.58 hours and 4 calls\n\nto Siddique Mia, first call was at 9.55 hours and the last call\n\nwas at 17.20 hrs. Documentary evidence further indicates that\n\non 11.11.2008 Siddique Mia had a telephonic conversation with\n\nMustaque Mia around 19.19 hours and Siddique Mia had also\n\ntelephonic conversation   with Saraswati and the first call was\n\naround 9.55 hours and the last call was at 21.42 hours.\n\nSaraswati had a      telephonic conversation            too with Durga\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                22</span>\n\nSutradhar     on that date and there were six incoming and\n\noutgoing calls.

Apart from telephonic conversation, no other evidence\n\nwas adduced by the prosecution to bring home that             first\n\naccused hatched a conspiracy. There is no evidence to prove\n\nas to how the appellants 2 and 3 ( Siddique Mia and Mustaque\n\nMia) had gone to    the place of occurrence and what was their\n\nsubsequent conduct.          Their   presence near the   scene of\n\noccurrence could have been established        by   the prosecution\n\neither by examining some witnesses near and around the place\n\nof occurrence or by proving the location of the calls so as to\n\nestablish the proximity of the accused with the scene of\n\noccurrence. Apart from the extract of the call records, no other\n\nevidence was adduced          by the prosecution to establish the\n\nconspiracy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">26.         Apart from telephonic conversation, prosecution also\n\nrelied upon     recoveries     made pursuant to the confessional\n\nstatement     of the appellants 2 and 3 (Siddique Mia and\n\nMustaque Mia). Pursuant to the statement of Siddique Mia one\n\nTVS Fiero red colour motor cycle bearing No. WB-54B/8245\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                               23</span>\n\nwith its key and      nokia mobile handset (phone No.9932345230)\n\nwere seized under Ext.17/3.         Pursuant to the statement       of\n\nMustaque Mia       nokia mobile     handset    having connection No.\n\n9932705533, one gold finger ring in the shape of a flower with\n\ninscription of letter ‘Anjali’, and silver made chain with one\n\nAmethist and red coral      fitted with it    were seized under Ext.\n\n18/3. Recoveries made        and seizure list were sought to be\n\nproved    by examination of PW17-Uttam Mondal.             PW17 had\n\ndeposed that he knew deceased              Anjali.   PW17 was then\n\nemployed in the hotel run by Bhagyadhar Dhibar which was\n\nowned by Anjali. In his evidence PW17 stated that in January\n\n2009, two or three gentlemen came to his hotel and took his\n\nsignature and that he did not know why his signatures were\n\nbeing taken.     Though PW17 identified his signatures         in the\n\nseizure list, evidence of    PW17 no way        establishes recoveries\n\nbeing made at the instance of the accused 2 and 3. Evidence of\n\nPW17 is far from convincing and is not of much assistance to\n\nthe prosecution       as he has not clearly spoken about the\n\nrecoveries and the seizure list. The gold ring and silver made\n\nchain recovered were also not shown to the other witnesses for\n\nbeing    identified   as that of Anjali.      No other evidence was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                 24</span>\n\nadduced by the prosecution to substantiate the recovery                 of\n\nobjects and the seizure list.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">27.       Sofar as the complicity             of fourth accused-Durga\n\nSutradhar, the prosecution mainly relied upon the call record\n\nand   judicial confession of          Durga   recorded by         Judicial\n\nMagistrate, 2nd Court, Suri, Birbhum (Ext.26).               Prosecution\n\nrelied upon the recovery              a notebook seized        from the\n\npossession of     appellant      Durga Sutradhar where she has\n\nwritten Kiriti’s phone number clandestinely coded as ‘Dadu’.\n\nExt. 30 call records of Kiriti Pal phone also revealed that there\n\nwere number of calls from Kiriti Pal to fourth appellant. Like\n\nin the case of    appellants No. 2 and 3           (Siddique Mia      and\n\nMustaque Mia) apart from         telephone calls, no other evidence\n\nwas adduced by the prosecution to bring home the guilt of\n\nfourth accused-Durga Sutradhar.               Insofar as the judicial\n\nconfessional statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C., it\n\nis not an inculpatory statement; but it is only to the effect of\n\nshowing     the subsequent            conduct of    A-1 Kiriti Pal in\n\nthreatening Durga Sutradhar–fourth appellant              not to disclose\n\nanything to the police. In our view, neither the telephone calls\n\nbetween         the   first     appellant-Kiriti    Pal     and    Durga\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                               25</span>\n\nSutradhar-fourth appellant nor her confessional statement by\n\nthemselves would be sufficient to establish the guilt of fourth\n\nappellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">28.          In a case based on circumstantial evidence, the court\n\nmust adopt       a very conscious approach and should record\n\nconviction only if all the links in the chain are complete pointing\n\nto the guilt of the accused.        All the links   forming complete\n\nchain must be firmly established by the prosecution. Each link\n\ntaken separately may just           suggest suspicion      but such\n\nsuspicion     itself may not take the place of         proof and not\n\nsufficient to convict the accused. All the circumstances must\n\nbe firmly established     and must be consistent only with the\n\nhypothesis of the guilt.      But that is not to say that the\n\nprosecution must meet each and every hypothesis put forward\n\nby    the accused however farfetched      it may be.    As discussed\n\nearlier, the telephonic calls and the recovery            may raise\n\nsuspicion against the accused but mere suspicion itself cannot\n\ntake the place of proof. In our view, evidence adduced by the\n\nprosecution     against   appellants 2 and 3 (Siddique Mia and\n\nMustaque Mia) do not form a complete chain connecting the\n\naccused with the crime       and the conviction of the appellants\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                              26</span>\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 302</a> IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 120B</a> IPC cannot be\n\nsustained and deserves to be set aside.    Likewise, conviction of\n\nfourth appellant-Durga Sutradhar under Section 120B cannot\n\nbe sustained and is liable to be set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">29.
