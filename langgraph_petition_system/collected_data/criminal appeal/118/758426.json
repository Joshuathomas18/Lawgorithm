KURDUKAR, J.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     A primitive  theory of  punishment, &quot;limb for limb; eye\nfor  eye;  ear\tfor  ear;  etc.,  etc.,&quot;  prevalent  in\t the\nuncivilized society was put into action in letter and spirit\nin the\tpresent time.  The magnitude  of the  oresent  crime\nneeds no  elaboration. In the present crime five deaths were\ninvolved in  which a boy of ten years had been assaulted and\nthrown into the fire and roasted alive; heads of three human\nbodies were  severed  and  the\t5th  who  sustained  firearm\ninjuries died  in the  hospital after  about 17\t days due to\nsepticaemia. Such  is the  gravity of  the crime. 24 persons\nwere arranged  at the trial as accused and at the conclusion\nof the trail, the trial court awarded death sentence to four\naccused, life  imprisonment to\ttwelve accused and acquitted\nseven accused.\tThe trial  court made  a reference filed the\n<a href=\"/doc/1684469/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 355</a> Cr.P.C.: the convicted accused filed the appeals\nincluding those who had been awarded capital punishment; the\nState of  U.P. also filed two appeals; one against the order\nof acquittal of seven accused and another for enhancement of\nsentence in  respect of other accused. The batch of criminal\nappeals was  heard together  by the High Court of Allahabad.\nThe High Court confirmed the death sentences awarded to four\naccused and  in addition  thereto while\t allowing the  State\nappeal for  enhancement, awarded the death sentence to three\naccused.  The  State  appeal  filed  against  the  order  or\nacquittal had  been allowed  and  they\twere  convicted\t for\nvarious offences including substantive offence under <a href=\"/doc/1983271/\" id=\"a_2\">Section\n302</a> with  the aid  of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 149</a> IPC and sentenced each one\nof them\t to suffer life imprisonment. The particulars of the\naccused, the  weapons used during the assault and details of\nthe deceased  will be  referred to  shortly. These  criminal\nappeals\t  have\t been\tfiled\tin   this   Court   by\t the\naccused/appellants challenging\tthe judgment  and  order  of\nconviction  and\t  sentence  passed  by\tthe  High  Court  on\n28.1.1997. All these appeals were heard together. Since they\narise out  of a\t common judgment, they are, therefore, being\ndisposed of by this judgment.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">(2)  Before we advert to the prosecution case we may set out\nthe particulars of the accused/appellants since most of them\ncome from  the same family and some are close relatives.

Sheo Pal\nand Ram\t Gulam\tare  the  relatives  of\t Sukhdarshan  (since\ndeceased).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(5)  The motive of the present crime was sought to be traced\nby the\tprosecution from  the murder of Chandrika Passi, who\nwas a brother of A-1 and resident of village Bajarakha. This\nmurder took place two and a half months prior to the present\noccurrence that\t took place  on\t 23.6.1990.  The  murder  of\nChandrika was  alleged to  be brutal  one as  his  head\t was\nsevered. The  family members  of Chandrika  were  suspecting\nthat Sheo  Pal and  Ram Gulam,\tthe relatives of Sukhdarshan\nhad committed  the said\t murder and, therefore, the criminal\ncase against both of them for an offence of murder is stated\nto be pending. The accused laboured under a belief that Sheo\nPal, Ram  Gulam and  his relatives  were responsible for the\nmurder of  Chandrika and it was this belief which gave cause\nto  nurture   enmity   against\t the   family\tmembers\t  of\nBhuwaneshwari, Sheo Pal and Ram Gulam. The second reason for\nenmity sought to be alleged by the prosecution was that Prem\nGiri (A-10) (since deceased) who was residing in an adjacent\nhouse to  Bhuwaneshwari, had  an axe  to grind\tagainst\t the\nfamily of  latter as  a\t civil\tdispute\t in  regard  to\t the\nproperty belonging  to &quot;Thakurji  Trust&quot; was pending between\nthem. Bhuwaneshwari obtained the decree against Prem Giri in\nthe trial  Court but  we are  told that\t the appeal filed by\nPrem Giri is pending in the higher court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">(6)  The occurrence  in question  took place  on 23.6.90  at\nabout 5.00  p.m., Mahendra  Kumar (P.W.1)  lodged the FIR at\nabout 9.05  p.m. at  Mitauli Police  Station situated  at  a\ndistance of  15 km.  from the  place  of  incident.  In\t his\ncomplaint Mahendra  Kumar (P.W.1)  had disclosed  all the 24\nnamed accused  along with  8 to\t 10 unidentified persons who\nhad come  to the house of Bhuwaneshwari. He then stated that\nat that\t time he  and Surendra\t(deceased) were sitting near\nthe couldron  and  his\tfather\tSukhdarshan  (deceased)\t was\nsitting near  the Kolhoo. All the accused person, armed with\ndeadly weapons,\t reached near  the Kolhoo. A-1, A-2, A-4 and\nA-13 were  armed with  Bankas,\tA-10  was  carrying  a\tDBBL\nlicensed gun,  A-3 and\tA-16 were armed with SBBL guns, A-20\nwas carrying country made SBBL gun and the remaining accused\nwere armed  with country  made pistols and guns. The accused\npersons\t when  reached\tnear  the  Kolhoo,  started  abusing\nSukhdarshan and Bhuwaneshwari (both since deceased) and were\nalso giving bad words on other members of their family. Then\nall the\t accused demanded  show how both could remain alive.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">Saying so all the accused persons chased Sukhdarshan who out\nof fear entered into the house of Shambhudayal and raised an\nalarm.\tKamlesh\t  (since  deceased)   s/o  Shambhudayal\t and\nShakuntala after allowing Sukhdarshan inside the house tried\nto shut\t the door  bu the accused inserted the barrel of the\ngun through  the door  and fired  which hit Kamlesh who fell\ndown.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">(7)  The miscreants  then opened the door and after entering\ninto the  house fired  at Sukhdarshan,\twho fell down in the\ncourtyard. A-2,\t A-4 and  A-13 thereafter caught hold of the\nhands and  feet of  Sukhdarshan whereupon  A-1 assaulted him\nwith Banka  and severed\t his head  and kept it in a piece of\ncloth. The  assailants then surrounded the house of Mahendra\nKumar (P.W.1)  the complainant,\t opened the door, demolished\nthe walls  and entered\tinto his  house. Family\t members  of\nMahendra Kumar\t(P.W.1), namely,  Goura the  grand mother of\nSurendra, and his wife Manorama, were inside the house, they\nrequested them\tnot to\tassault any  of the  family members.\nSurendra (since deceased) had a licensed gun. He immediately\nclosed and  bolted the\tdoor of\t his room from inside. Since\nthe door  could not  be opened,\t A-1 told  his associates to\nsprinkle the  diesel on\t the house  and set  it on fire. The\nmiscreants then\t took out  the\tdiesel\tfrom  the  drum\t and\nsprinkled it  on the  Chappar (roof) and also poured it into\nthe room  through a  hole where Surendra was hiding and then\nlit the\t fire to  chappar and  asked Surendra  to  come\t out\notherwise all  his family  members would  be done  to death.\nSandeep (since\tdeceased) a boy aged about 10 years, was the\nyounger brother\t of the\t complainant, came  out and  started\nabusing the  accused persons. A-6 then fired from his gun on\nSandeep causing\t injuries to  him and thereafter A-6 and A-8\nlifted Sandeep\tand threw  him into  the fire.\tSandeep\t was\nburnt alive  and died  in the said fire. This was the second\ncasualty in the course of the attack levelled by the accused\non the\tfamily members\tof the\tcomplainant. Surendra (since\ndeceased) then came out of the room and tried to run away as\nby that\t time the fire had engulfed his house. When Surendra\nwas running away he was fired at and because of the fire arm\ninjuries he  fell down\tin the\tkitchen. Thereafter A-2, A-4\nand A-13  caught hold  of the  hands and  legs of  Surendra,\nfacilitating A-1 to assault him with Banka. A-1 then severed\nthe head  of Surendra and kept it in the same piece of cloth\nwhere the  head of  Sukhdarshan was kept. It was then stated\nthat in\t the meantime  Bhuwaneshwari, the  grand  father  of\nMahendra Kumar\t(P.W.1)\t who  was  returning  from  Bajarkha\nmarket, on  seing the  accused\tin  action,  tried  to\trush\ntowards his  house but he was also not spared and caused him\nfire arm injuries. A-2, A-4 and A-13 then caught hold of the\nhands and feet of Bhuwaneshwari and thereafter A-1 assaulted\nhim with  Banka and severed his head and kept it in the same\nprice of  cloth where  two  heads  were\t already  kept.\t The\naccused persons thereafter went in search of Sheo Pal but he\nwas not\t found in the house. The accused persons then stated\nthat Sheo Pal was the person who had committed the murder of\nChandrika Passi\t and, therefore,  he must  be traced. Seeing\nthe ghastly murders of four persons and gun shot injuries on\nKamlesh,  the  family  members\tof  Mahendra  Kumar  (P.W.1)\nrequested the  accused persons to spare other family members\nwhereupon A-1  told his\t associates that  let the  remaining\nmembers of the family be spared to mourn the deaths of their\ndear  ones.   A-7  then\t  took\taway  the  licensed  gun  of\nSukhdarshan.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">(8)  It was  then stated  in the  complaint that due to fire\nthe house  of Surendra\tand Articles therein were completely\nburnt and  reduced to ashes. Such a ghastly attack continued\nfor a  period of  one and   a  half hour.  Although it was a\nweekly market  day of  village Bajarkha\t and so many persons\nhad gathered  in the  market but nobody dared to come to the\nrescue. The  brutality committed  by  the  accused  persons,\naccording to  the complainant  did not\trest at that but the\naccused persons\t then took  out\t a  victory  procession\t and\nraised the  slogans `Shyam  Manohar Zindabad&#x27;,\t`Nandlal and\nPrem Giri Zindabad&#x27;; Lakhpal Bhaiya Zindabad&quot; and thereafter\nwent towards the house of Chandrika Passi (since deceased).\n(9)  Mahendra Kumar  (P.W.1)  then  immediately\t prepared  a\ncomplaint  containing\taforesaid  facts  and  took  injured\nKamlesh in  a tractor  to the  police station which was at a\ndistance of  15 kms.  They handed  over the  complaint to SI\nSurendra Kumar\tPandey who  registered the  FIR\t Ex.Ka-1  at\nabout 9.05  p.m. on  the same evening. After registering the\ncrime Si  proceeded to\tthe place  of occurrence but by that\ntime it\t was too  late in the night and, therefore, he could\nnot hold  the  inquest\ton  the\t dead  bodies  but,  however\nrecorded the statements of various persons during late night\nhours. On  the next  day in  the early\tmorning he  held the\ninquest\t on  the  dead\tbodies\tof  Sukhdarshan\t (Ex.Ka-15),\nBhuwaneshwari (Ex.Ka-29),  Sandeep (Ex.Ka-26)  and  Surendra\n(Ex.Ka-29). The\t dead bodies  were then sent for post-mortem\nexamination. Other  formal panchnamas etc., were carried out\non 24.6.90. Kamlesh, who had sustained the gun shot injuries\nwas admitted  in the  hospital on  24.6.1990 at\t about\t8.00\na.m., who  lateron succumbed to the injuries on 10.7.90. The\ninquest report is at Ex.Ka-23. Eight empty cartridges, empty\ndrum of\t diesel and the ladder were seized from the place of\noccurrence. During investigation the accused persons came to\nbe arrested  and while\tin  custody  A-4  made\ta  voluntary\ndisclosure statement  under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_4\">Section  27</a> of  the Evidence Act\nwhich came  to be recorded and it led to the recovery of two\nsevered heads  of Sukhdarshan  and Bhuwaneshwari.  A-1 after\nhis arrest  also made  a statement which led to the recovery\nof a  gun from\tthe well.  After  completing  the  necessary\ninvestigation a\t charge-sheet came  to be  filed against  24\naccused persons\t for offences punishable under Sections 302,\n<a href=\"/doc/1593780/\" id=\"a_5\">147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/115231/\" id=\"a_6\">148</a>,  307, 436,  452, 404\tread with  <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 149</a>\tIPC.\nShyam Manohar  was separately charge-sheeted and tried under\n<a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 25</a> of the Arms Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">(10) The accused persons denied the charges levelled against\nthem. They pleaded that they have been falsely implicated in\nthe present  crime due\tto enmity with the witnesses as well\nas the\tpolice. A-1  further  pleaded  that  he\t was  living\nseparate from  Chandrika who  had a quarrel with him. He was\nnot doing  any pairvi  in  the\tmurder\tcase  of  Chandrika.\nAccording to  him Lakhpati and Sripal were leading the gange\nof dacoits  and the  present crime might have been the handy\nwork of\t this gange.  A-11 pleaded  that he  had  no  grudge\nagainst the  family members of the complainant on account of\ncivil dispute.\tBhuwandeshwari had obtained a decree against\nhis father  Prem  Giri\tbut  the  appeal  against  the\tsaid\njudgment and  decree is\t still pending in the High Court. He\nhas no\tconcern with  this dispute.  He and his brother A-12\nwere living  at Gola  where their children were studying and\nthey were  not present\tat the\ttime when  the incident took\nplace. A-1  in his  defence examined  Sher Ali\t(D.W.1). The\nother three  defence witnesses were examined on behalf of A-\n11 and\tA-12. The appellants pleaded that they were innocent\nand  they  be  acquitted.  The\tcharge-sheet  was  submitted\nagainst 24 accused persons but however Prem Giri (A-10) died\nduring the  pendency of\t trial and,  therefore, trial abated\nagainst him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">(11) In order  to bring\t home  the  guilt,  the\t prosecution\nmainly relied  upon the\t evidence of  two star witnesses who\nclaimed\t to   have  seen  the  entire  occurrence.  The\t eye\nwitnesses were\tMahendra Kumar\ts/o Sukhdarshan\t (P.W.1) and\nLallu Ram  (P.W.2) who was residing in the adjacent house of\nShambhu Dayal, brother of Kamlesh (since deceased). Dr. S.K.\nShukla (P.W.3)\tconducted the post mortem examination on the\nheadless dead  body of Surendra and also on his severed head\n(Ex.K-3). Dr.  A.K. Gupta  (P.W.8) held\t the autopsy  on the\nskulls of deceased Bhuwaneshwari and Sukhdarshan (Ex.K-6 and\nK-7 respectively).  Dr. S.K.  Tiwari (P.W.9)  conducted\t the\nautopsy on  the dead  bodies of\t Sandeep, Bhuwaneshwari\t and\nSukhdarshan.  Post  Mortem  reports  are  Exs.8,  9  and  10\nrespectively. Dr.  A.K.

The prosecution sought to\nprove the  motive against  the\taccused\t in  committing\t the\npresent crime.\tIt is  on this background we are required to\nscrutinize and\tappreciate the evidence of the eye witnesses\nwith utmost care and caution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">(15)  The  prosecution\tcase  substantially  rested  on\t the\nevidence  of  two  eye\twitnesses,  namely,  Mahendra  Kumar\n(P.W.1) and Lallu Ram (P.W.2). mahendra Kumar (P.W.1) is the\nson  of\t Sukhdarshan  (since  deceased)\t and  grand  son  of\nBhuwaneshwari (since deceased). Sandeep (since deceased) was\nhis brother  and Surendra,  another deceased was his cousin,\nKamlesh (since deceased) was a\tclose relative.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">     Coming to\tthe evidence of actual occurrence which took\nplace on  June 23,  1990 at  about 5.00\t p.m. it needs to be\nstated that  a complaint was lodged on the very same evening\nat about  9.05 p.m.  in the  police station  at Mitauli at a\ndistance of  15 kms.  from Bajarkha  village. Mahendra Kumar\n(P.W.1) in  his evidence  testified that  at about 5.00 p.m.\nall the\t 24 accused  along with 8 to 10 unidentified persons\ncame in\t the direction\tof Kamlesh&#x27;s  house.  At  that\ttime\nMahendra Kumar\t(P.W.1) and  Surendra were  sitting near the\ncouldron and  Sukhdarshan was  sitting towards\tthe north of\nthe kolhoo.  A-1, A-2,\tA-4 and A-13 were armed with bankas,\nPrem Giri  (A-10) (now\tdead) was armed with a DBBL gun, A-3\nto A-16\t were armed  with SBBL\tguns, A-20  was armed with a\ncountry made SBBL gun and the remaining accused persons were\narmed with country made pistols and guns He then stated that\nthe accused  persons demanded that Ram Gulam and Sheo Pal be\ncalled and  they wanted\t to see how they would remain alive.\nThe accused  persons then  chased Sukhdarshan  who  ran\t and\nentered into the house of Shambhu Dayal and raised an alarm.\nShambhu Dayal  and Shakuntala  Devi  (complainant&#x27;s  mother)\ntook Sukhdarshan inside the house and tried to shut the door\nbut one\t of the\t accused inserted  the\tbarrel\tof  the\t gun\nthrough door  and fired which hit Kamlesh Kumar. The accused\nthen opened  the door and fired at Sukhdarshan who fell down\nin the\tcourtyard. A-2, A-4 and A-13 then caught hold of the\nlegs and  hands of  Sukhdarshan and thereafter A-1 assaulted\nhim with Banka and severed his head which he kept in a piece\nof cloth.  The accused\tpersons then surrounded the house of\nP.W.1 and started demolishing the walls. They asked Surendra\nto come\t out as\t he bolted the door of his room from inside.\nA-1 asked  his associates  to  sprinke\tthe  diesel  on\t the\nchappar and  also pour\tit into the room and set it on fire.\nAccordingly some  of the  accused took\tthe diesel  from the\ndrum and one of them climbed up the chappar with the help of\na ladder,  sprinkled the  diesel on  the  chappar  and\talso\npoured the  same into  the room and thereafter the house was\nset on\tfire. Sandeep,\tthe brother of the complainant, aged\nabout 10 years, came out and abused the accused whereupon A-\n6 fired at him as a result of which he fell down. A-5 and A-\n8 then\tlifted Sandeep\tand threw him into the fire. Sandeep\nwas roasted  alive. The\t witness further  testified that the\nhouse, wherein\tSurindra was  hiding, when  caught fire,  he\ncame out  of the said house and tried to run away but he was\ngun down.  He fell  down in  the kitchen.  A-4, A-2 and A-13\nthen overpowered  him by catching hold of his arms, feet and\nthereafter   A-1 assaulted  him with  Banka and\t severed his\nhead and  kept it  in the same piece of cloth with the other\nhead. The  witness then\t stated\t that  Bhuwaneshwari  (since\ndeceased), his\tgrand father,  who was\treturning  from\t the\nweekly market,\twhen saw  the accused persons in action came\nnear and  requested them  not to  kill\tthe  family  members\nwhereupon he  was fired\t and thereafter\t A-4, A-2  and\tA-13\noverpowered him. A-1 then assaulted Bhuwaneshwari with Banka\nand severed  his head and kept it in the same piece of cloth\nwhere two  heads were  already kept. He then stated that the\naccused persons\t made a\t search for Sheo Pal who was alleged\nto have\t taken part  in committing  the murder of Chandrika,\nthe brother  of A-1, by severing his head but Sheo Pal could\nnot be traced. P.W.1 further stated that the accused persons\nwere using  the firearms  freely and  created a\t terror. The\nincident continued  for one  and a  half hour.\tThe  accused\npersonals then\tcarried the  three  heads  with\t them  in  a\nprocession  celebrating\t their\tvictory\t and  were  shouting\nslogans &quot;Shyam\tManohar\t Zindabad,  Nandlal  and  Prem\tGiri\nZindabad and Lakhapat Zindabad&quot;. Then they went to the house\nof Chandrika. The witness was cross-examined at great length\nbut the\t defence could\thardly bring  on record any material\nwhich would discredit his credibility. The evidence of P.W.1\nfinds corroboration  from the first Information Report which\nwas  lodged   at  9.05\t p.m.  (within\tfour  hours  of\t the\noccurrence) at\tMitauli police\tstation. The  complaint\t was\nwritten after the incident was over. Mahendra Kumar (P.W.1),\nLallu Ram  (P.W.2) and\tKamlesh then  went in  a tractor  to\nlodge the  First Information  Report. The  FIR\tcame  to  be\nregistered against  24 accused persons. It needs to be noted\nthat Mahendra  Kumar (P.W.1)  in his complaint had named the\naccused persons\t with the  weapons which  they were carrying\nand the manner in which they assaulted five persons who lost\ntheir lives in the present crime. The FIR fully corroborates\nthe evidence  of  P.W.1.  The  evidence\t of  Mahendra  Kumar\n(P.W.1) does  not suffer  from any  infirmity. We  have also\nscrutinized  the  evidence  of\tLallu  Ram  (P.W.2)  and  it\ncorroborates in\t all material  particulars the\tevidence  of\nMahendra Kumar\t(P.W.1). The trial court as well as the High\nCourt had  scrutinized their  evidence\tvery  carefully\t and\naccepted the  same as  truthful. We  concur with  the courts\nbelow as  regards appreciation\tof the evidence of these two\nwitnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">(16) Mr. A.K.  Ganguli, Learned Senior Counsel appearing for\nthe condemned  prisoners, Mr.  Sushil Kumar,  Learned Senior\nCounsel and Mr. Shakil Ahmed Syed, Learned Counsel appearing\nfor the\t life convicts\turged that  the\t conviction  of\t the\naccused is based on the evidence of interested witnesses and\nthe same  be  not  accepted  as\t truthful  inasmuch  as\t the\npresence of  these witnesses  at the  time of occurrence was\nextremely doubtful.  It was  contended that  23.6.90  was  a\nmarket day  of Bajarkha\t village and  these  witnesses\talso\nadmitted that the market is at a distance of a furlong where\nmany villagers had come for purchases. The witnesses further\nadmitted that  many persons  had gathered  at the  place  of\noccurrence, if this be so it was very much necessary for the\nprosecution to\texamine some  independent witnesses  to lend\nassurance to  the credibility  of the  evidence of these two\neye witnesses.\tThese submissions  do not impress us at all.\nNow a  days it\tis a  common tendency that so outsider would\nlike to\t get involved  into criminal  case much\t less in the\ncrime of  present magnitude  and, therefore,  it  was  quite\nnatural that  no independent  witness would  come forward to\nassist the prosecution. It is well settled that the evidence\nof witnesses  cannot be\t discredited only on the ground that\nthey are  close relatives  of the deceased persons. All that\nis required  in such  a situation  is that  the\t court\tmust\nscrutinize the\tevidence of  such witnesses with utmost care\nand caution. The magnanimity of the present crime and nature\nof prosecution\tevidence has  put us  on guard to appreciate\nthe evidence of these two eye witnesses with utmost care and\ncaution. We  have done this exercise and we are unable to be\npersuaded to  discard the evidence of these two witnesses on\nthe grounds  urged before  us. The  evidence of\t both  these\nwitnesses   in\t  our\tconsidered    view   is\t  absolutely\nstraightforward, unblemished  and without any infirmity. The\nFirst Information Report which was lodged within four hours,\nnaming\tall   the  accused   also  lends  assurance  to\t our\nconviction that\t the evidence  of  these  two  witnesses  is\ntrustworthy and\t cannot be discarded. The contentions of the\nlearned counsel for the accused, therefore, stand rejected.\n(17) It was  then contended  by Mr.  Sushil Kumar  that\t the\nclaim of the complainant that he lodged the FIR at 9.05 p.m.\nis false.  According to\t him if\t the FIR  was registered  as\nalleged there  was no reason whatsoever why the copy thereof\nwas not\t sent to  the  Illaqa  Magistrate  at  the  earliest\nopportunity. As\t regards the  contents of  the FIR  he urged\nthat it was impossible for any human being to write down the\ncomplaint with such details when four dead bodies were lying\nof which three were without heads in the house. The contents\nof the\tcomplaint manifestly  suggest that  it was  an after\nthought exercise  with the  help of  police or\tsomebody  to\nspread a wide net and involve as many accused as possible to\ntake revenge. He, therefore, urged that the complaint lodged\nby Mahendra Kumar (P.W.1) be treated a false document and be\nnot accepted for the purpose of seeking corroboration to the\nevidence of P.W.1. He also urged that the complainant at the\nrelevant time was serving at a different place and his claim\nthat he\t had come  on leave  for  two  days  was  totally  a\nconcocted plea. According to him the complainant was brought\nto the\tvillage at  a later point of time and the police had\nmanipulated entire prosecution story. We see no substance in\nany of\tthese contentions  for the  simple reason  that\t the\npolice machinery  reached the  place of\t incident  within  a\nshort time i.e. at about 11 p.m. and in fact the evidence of\nSI  Pandey   (P.W.14)  would   show  that   the\t wheels\t  of\ninvestigating  machinery  started  moving  during  the\tsame\nnight. The  statements of  some of the persons were recorded\nduring the  same night.\t The inquest on the dead bodies were\ncarried out  early in the morning of June 24, 1990. There is\nnothing in  the evidence  of SI\t Pandey (P.W.14) to indicate\nthat he\t had ante  dated all  these documents to suit to the\ncomplainant&#x27;s version.\tThere was  no earthly  reason for SI\nPandey (P.W.14)\t to implicate  and spread the net so wide as\ncontended for  the accused  to arraign 24 accused persons in\nthe present  crime. To\tour mind  it is\t only a\t figment  of\nimagination to contend that the investigation carried out by\nthe investigating  machinery was  ante dated at the instance\nof the\tcomplainant. It\t is true that the complainant at the\nrelevant time  was posted at a far of place but he testified\nthat he\t had come to the village Bajarkha on two days&#x27; leave\nas he  had not come till then to his village after he joined\nthe service.  This explanation given by the witness is quite\nplausible and  the courts  below were right in accepting his\npresence at  the time  of occurrence.  It is  also true that\nthere was  a delay  in forwarding the copy of the FIR to the\nIllaqa Magistrate  but that  circumstance would not demolish\nthe other  positive and\t credible evidence  on record.\tThis\nwould  only   show  how\t  in  such   a\tserious\t  crime\t the\ninvestigating agency  was not careful and prompt as it ought\nto be.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">(18) It was then contended for the appellants that if really\nthe incident  was reported  at 9.05  p.m.  then\t surely\t the\ninquest reports\t which were  prepared on  the following\t day\nmust mention  the title\t of the crime. But it was left blank\nand, therefore,\t this omission\twas a  serious infirmity and\ndemolishes the\tvery substratum\t of the prosecution based on\nthe first  Information Report which is a concocted document.\nAt the\tfirst flush  the argument  appeared to us attractive\nbut on scrutiny and consideration of the materials on record\nwe are\tunable to  accept this\tsubmission.  If\t really\t the\ncomplaint was  not lodged at 9.05 p.m. then the police could\nnot have  reached at  the place\t of occurrence at 11.00 p.m.\nSuch minor  omission is\t nothing but  a\t bonafide  error  or\ncasual approach\t on the\t part of  the  investigating  agency\nwhich does  not affect\tthe substratum\tof  the\t prosecution\nstory. It  was then  urged that Kamlesh was taken the police\nstation in  an injured\tcondition but he was not sent to the\nhospital for  treatment. In  fact Kamlesh was not traced for\nthe whole  night and  only on  the following day he appeared\nand was admitted in the hospital where he died after 17 days\ndue to\tsepticaemia. It\t was, therefore,  urged that neither\nKamlesh nor  the complainant ever went to the police station\nto lodge  a complaint  at 9.05\tp.m. and  this complaint was\nmanufactured at a later stage with the connivance of police,\nWe see no substance in this contention also because the fact\nremains that  Kamlesh was  injured during  the\tincident  in\nquestion. If  he was  not sent\tto the\thospital for medical\nexamination and\t treatment by  the investigating  agency  no\nfault could be found with the complainant&#x27;s evidence and the\nFIR (Ex.  Ka-1). In  these circumstances  we see no merit in\nall these contentions raised on behalf of the appellants.\n(19) No serious arguments were advanced before us as regards\nthe cause of death of any of these five deceased persons. It\nwas also  not seriously\t challenged that  the finding of the\ncourts below  that Bhuwaneshwari,  Sukhdarshan, Surendra and\nSandeep met  with homicidal  death during  the\tincident  in\nquestion.  Suffice   it\t to   mention  that   Bhuwaneshwari,\nSukhdarshan and Surendra had sustained many incised injuries\ndue to\tassault by Banka on their vital parts in addition to\nthe prosecution\t was first  fired at  by A-6 and then he was\nthrown into the smouldering fire. The injuries caused on his\ndead body  either by  fire arm\tor by  banka  could  not  be\ndetected in  the post-mortem  report for  the obvious reason\nthat his  body was completely charred. The autopsy report of\nSandeep also  did not  indicate that  any pellet  was  found\nembeded in  the body  or any  pellet could be recovered from\nthe place  where he  was burnt to death. This fact has got a\nrelevance when\twe consider  the death\tsentence awarded  to\nRajendra (A-6).\t After going through the medical evidence on\nrecord we  have no  manner of  doubt that these four persons\nmet with  the homicidal deaths. They were brutally murdered.\nAs far\tKamlesh (since deceased) was concerned it was proved\nbeyond any  pale of  doubt that\t he was\t the first person to\nsustain gun  shot injuries  and died  in the hospital due to\nsepticaemia which  was the  result of injuries on his person\nduring occurrence in question.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">(20) Shri Sushil Kumar, Learned Senior Counsel appearing for\nthe life  convicts/appellants urged  that they were roped-in\nin the\tpresent crime  with the\t aid  of  <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_31\">Section  149</a>\tIPC.\nAccording to  him the common object of the unlawful assembly\nas alleged  by the  prosecution was  to take revenge against\nRam Gulam  and Sheo  Pal who  alleged to  have committed the\nmurder of  Chandrika by\t severing his  head. If this was the\ncommon object  of the unlawful assembly it could not be said\nthat these  life  convicts/appellants  assuming\t to  be\t the\nmembers of  such an unlawful assembly shared the same common\nobject which  the assailants  of five  victims\thad  and  in\npursuance thereof  committed the  murders  in  question.  He\nurged that  these convicts/appellants had nothing to do with\nthe murder  of Chandrika  and, therefore,  theory of revenge\nagainst any  of the  members of the complainant&#x27;s family had\nno basis.  In the absence of specific proof of common object\nof the\tunlawful assembly  to commit the murders in question\nhe  urged   that  life\tthe  convicts/appellants  cannot  be\nconvicted with\tthe aid\t of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_32\">Section  149</a> IPC.  In support of\nthis contention\t he drew our attention to three decisions of\nthis Court:  (i) Shambhu  Nath Singh and Others vs. State of\nBihar AIR  (1960) SC  725 (ii)\tBhudeo Mandal and Others vs.\nState of  Bihar (1981)\t2 SCC  755; and (iii) Raghubir Singh\nand Others  vs. State  of Punjab  (1996) 9  SCC 233. We have\nvery carefully\tgone through  these  decisions\tand  in\t our\nconsidered view in the facts and circumstances of this case,\nthe ratio  laid down  in any of these decisions will have no\napplication. Taking  the prosecution  case as  it is  if the\nobject of the unlawful assembly was to take revenge upon Ram\nGulam and  Sheo Pal  and after coming to know that they were\nnot available  at the  house of\t Bhuwaneshwari and  Surendra\n(both since deceased), there was no reason for these accused\npersons\t  to\tcontinue   to\t fire\ton   these   victims\nindiscriminately; to  catch hold  of the four victims one by\none; severe  the  heads\t of  three  persons  and  keep\tthem\ntogether in  a piece  of cloth;\t and threw Sandeep into then\nsmouldering fire.  What sin  the  young\t boy  of  10  years,\nSandeep had  committed so  that he  also could not have been\nspared from  the assault?  He was  totally innocent  and was\nhardly of  an age  to understand  the rivalery\tbetween\t the\nparties to take side of one or the other. He was thrown into\nthe fire  and  roasted\talive.\tInjuries  sustained  by\t the\ndeceased persons unmistakably indicated that it could not be\nthe job\t of handful  of persons. It was pre-planned and well\nthought of  design to commit genocide. It is in this context\nif we read the evidence of P.W.1 and P.W.2 we have no manner\nof  doubt  that\t the  accused  persons\tformed\tan  unlawful\nassembly and  the object  of that  assembly was\t not only to\ntake revenge  against Ram  Gulam and  Sheo Paul\t but also to\ntake revenge upon the family members of Bhuwaneshwari as Ram\nGulam and  Sheo\t Pal  were  related  to\t Sukhdarshan  (since\ndeceased) and the accused persons were under the belief that\nthe victims  were giving shelter to them, All the appellants\nin our\tconsidered view\t formed an unlawful assembly with an\nobject to  take revenge\t against Ram  Gulam and Sheo Pal and\nalso to\t commit mass  murders in  that process\tto prove the\nsupermacy and  create a\t terror in  the minds  of the family\nmembers of  Bhuwaneshwari. The\toccurrence in  question\t was\nfull of\t revenge which\twas deep-rooted\t in  the  minds\t and\naction of  the accused\tpersons and  they were determined to\ntake revenge  in the  same manner  in  which  Chandrika\t was\nmurdered. Apart\t from this we see no difficulty holding that\nthe unlawful  assembly could  develop a common object on the\nspur of\t moment to commit the massacre of the family members\nof Bhuwaneshwari. We, therefore, see no reason whatsoever to\ndiffer from the findings of the courts below that the common\nobject of  the unlawful\t assembly was  to  commit  the\tmass\nmurders of  the family\tmembers of  Bhuwaneshwari. There  is\nalso another  angle  to\t judge\tthe  common  object  of\t the\nunlawful assembly  in the present crime and that is the mode\nof brutalty.  Chandrika was alleged to have been murdered by\nRam Gulam  and Sheo  Pal (trial\t of both  is  pending).\t The\nmanner in which Chandrika was done to death and his head was\nsevered the  accused wanted  to take  revenge  in  the\tsame\nmanner and  for this  reason the  modus operandi  adopted by\nthem was to cause firearm injuries to these three persons on\na non-vital  part of  the  bodies  so  that  they  would  be\nimmobilized and\t then cause Banka injuries and at the end to\nsevere their  heads. Only  one\tgun  shot  would  have\tbeen\nsufficient to  cause  the  death  of  four  victims  as\t the\nassailants were standing at a close range but that could not\nhave satisfied\tthe ego\t and vengence because they wanted to\nsevere the heads of these three victims when they were lying\nimmobilized due\t to injuries.  It is for this reason we have\nstarted out  judgment by saying that the accused persons had\nin the\tletter and  spirit followed  the primitive theory of\npunishment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">(21) Learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  appellants\tthen\ncontended that\tthere is  no material on record to hold that\nthe accused  persons had  any enmity  with the family of the\ndeceased. The  prosecution came forward with two fold notice\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">(i) civil  litigation between Prem Giri and Bhuwaneshwari as\nregards the  &quot;Thakurji&#x27;s Trust&quot;\t and its  property; and (ii)\nthe accused  persons belonged to the party of Shyam Manohar.\nThe first  part of motive, the civil litigation between Prem\nGiri and  Bhuwaneshwari ended  in favour of Bhuwaneshwari in\nthe first  court and  the appeal  of Prem  Giri\t is  pending\nbefore the  Orissa High\t Court. In a village such dispute of\nten assume  importance out  of proportion. It is, therefore,\nnot surprising\tthat Prem  Giri joined\tthe party  of A-1 to\nsettle his  ego and score also. As far as the second limb of\nthe motive  is concerned  it is\t the case of the prosecution\nthat the  accused persons  belonged to\tthe party  of  Shyam\nManohar (A-1) who wanted to take revenge against the victims\nin a  most brutal  and befitting  manner for  murder of\t his\nbrother Chandrika.  The two  suspects, namely, Ram Gulam and\nSheo Pal  happened to be the close relations of Sukhdarshan.\nThe  appellants/accused\t  were\t under\t the   belief\tthat\nSukhdarshan  and   his\tother  family  members\twere  giving\nprotection to  these two suspects and it was for that reason\nthe accused  persons formed an unlawful assembly and marched\ntowards the  house of  victims to teach a lesson in the same\nmanner in  which Chandrika was done to death and commit mass\nmurders. The  issue of motive in our considered view is well\nproved in  the facts and circumstances of the case in favour\nof the prosecution.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">(22) It was  then contended  for the accused/appellants that\nthe  evidence\tof  P.W.1   was\t  totally   artificial\t and\nunbelievable. To  support his  contention our  attention was\ndrawn to  his evidence\twherein\t he  had  stated  that\twhen\naccused persons\t were assaulting  Kamlesh, Sandeep, Surendra\nand Sukhdarshan\t he was standing in front of them requesting\nthem to\t spare his  family members.  If the accused had gone\nwith the common object of committing the mass murders and if\nMahendra Kumar\t(P.W.1) was  available so  easily yet it was\nsurprising that\t not even a scratch was found on his person.\nIt was\talmost\teasy  for  the\taccused\t persons  to  finish\nMahendra Kumar\t(P.W.1) as  well as (P.W.2) but in fact they\ndid not\t do  so.  Relying  upon\t this  circumstance  it\t was\ncontended that\tthough these witnesses claimed to be the eye\nwitnesses but  their presence  was  extremely  doubtful\t and\npolice\twith   the  connivance\tof  Mahendra  Kumar  (P.W.1)\ncontrived a  false story by spreading a wide net. We are not\nimpressed by this argument at all as the materials on record\nprove otherwise.  It was  then contended that almost all the\naccused persons\t except A-10  (now dead),  A-11 and A-12 are\nfrom the  same family of Jodhey amd Raghubar and the list of\naccused was  further inflated  by adding  relatives who even\ndid not\t stay  in  the\tvillage.  In  this  context  it\t was\nstrenuously urged  before us  that the\tinvestigating agency\nhad widened  the net  at the instance of P.W.1 to involve as\nmany accused  as possible.  This argument  against does\t not\ndetain us  for any  longer because  the evidence  of two eye\nwitnesses was  found to be acceptable and trustworthy and we\ndo not\tsee any\t scope to  give even any benefit of doubt to\nany one\t of these accused persons for the offences for which\nthey have been convicted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">(23) At this  stage we\tdeem it\t necessary to  refer to\t the\ndefence evidence.  A-1 examined\t Sher Ali (D.W.1) to support\nhis plea  of alibi. Sher Ali (D.W.1) stated that A-1 used to\nstay in\t the orchard situated in between Mekhnapar and limra\nwhich is away from the place of occurrence. This evidence in\nour considered\tview does not on prepondrance of probability\nestablish the plea of alibi. In this view of the matter this\nevidence was  rightly not accepted by the courts below. A-11\nand A-12  also pleaded alibi and in support thereof examined\nManiram Verma (D.W.2) and Surendra Pal (D.W.3) who were then\nworking as  clerks in  Krishak College\tGola. They testified\nthat during  1987-88  children\tof  both  the  accused\twere\nstudying in  the  said\tcollege.  A-11\tand  A-12  in  their\nstatements recorded  under Section  313\t Cr.  P.C.  gave  an\nexplanation  that  at  the  time  of  occurrence  they\twere\nresiding  at   Village\tGola   where  their   children\twere\nschooling. Sri\tRam (D.W.4)  who was  the teacher at village\nPiperva stated\tthat  Bajarkha\tvillage\t is  situated  at  a\ndistance of  one km.  but admitted  that he was not teaching\nthe children  of A-11  and A-12.  We have gone through their\nevidence and  we are  satisfied that their evidence does not\nprove the  plea of  alibi set  up by  both the\taccused.  It\ncannot be  assumed that\t merely because\t the  children\twere\nstudying at  village Gola, the parents were also residing at\nthat village.  Except this  evidence to\t prove the  plea  of\nalibi no  other evidence  was led on behalf of these accused\npersons. We  are afraid\t that this  evidence even on test of\nprobability can\t prove the plea of alibi set up by A-1, A-11\nand A-12.  Both the  courts  below  committed  no  error  in\nrejecting the plea of alibi set up by A-1, A-11 and A-12.\n(24) Coming to\tthe question  of sentence  we have heard the\nlearned\t counsel   for\tthe  parties  at  great\t length\t and\nconsidered the\tfacts and  circumstances of  the  case\tvery\ncarefully; the\tmanner in which the incident took place; the\nrole played  by each of the accused and most importantly the\nextreme brutality  with which  the members  of the  unlawful\nassembly  acted.   The\tquestion,  therefore,  is  does\t the\nconscience of an ordinary human being not shocked to see the\nextreme brutality  and disregard  to the  human dignity?  As\nindicated earlier A-1, A-2, A-4, A-5, A-6, A-8 and A-13 have\nbeen awarded  death penalty  by the  High Court. Of these we\nwill take  the case of Rajendra (A-6) first. The trial court\nawarded him the life imprisonment whereas in an appeal filed\nby the\tState the  High Court  enhanced the sentence of life\nimprisonment to death. The reason given by the High Court is\nthat some of the accused persons who have been awarded death\nsentence formed\t one group  which must\tinclude A-6  who had\nplayed\tan  identical  role  and,  therefor,  there  was  no\njustification to  award this  accused lesser  sentence. With\nrespect we  are unable\tto agree  with the  reasoning of the\nHigh Court as regards the death sentence awarded to A-6. The\nrole attributed\t to Rajendra  as  stated  by  both  the\t eye\nwitnesses was  that he\tfired from his gun which hit Sandeep\nwhereupon  he\tfell  down.  Thereafter\t Prakash  (A-8)\t and\nRavinder (A-5) threw him into the smouldering fire. No other\nrole was  attributed to\t A-6 as far as Sandeep is concerned.\nDr. S.K.  Tewari (P.W.9)  who performed\t the autopsy  on the\ndead body  of Sandeep could not find any pellet in his body.\nThe prosecution\t also could not collect the evidence to show\nthat any  pellet was recovered from the ashes. The dead body\nof Sandeep  was totally charred and, therefore, doctor could\nnot find  any injury  on his  dead  body.  It  is  in  these\ncircumstances  A-6  could  not\tbe  bracketed  with  accused\npersons who  have been\tawarded death  sentence. A-6, in our\nconsidered view\t is entitled to a differential treatment for\nwant of\t conclusive evidence  that he  had caused  fire\t arm\ninjuries to Sandeep. We must make it clear that this finding\nby itself  would not absolve A-6 from his culpability in the\npresent crime  with the\t aid of\t <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 149</a>  IPC as regards\nother  murders.\t  His  presence\t  was  proved  beyond  every\nreasonable doubt  at the time of occurrence. He was a member\nof an unlawful assembly having a common object to commit the\nmurders in question and in prosecution thereof used his fire\narm along  with other accused who were armed with fire arms.\nIn view\t of these proved facts we are of the considered view\nthat the  death sentence  awarded to  Rajendra (A-6) was not\nproper and  instead he\tmust fall in the group comprising of\naccused/appellants who\tused the  fire arms  and  have\tbeen\nawarded life  imprisonment. We accordingly convert the death\nsentence awarded  to Rajendra  (A-6) to\t a life imprisonment\nwithout upsetting  his convictions  on this  count  as\talso\nconvictions and sentences on other counts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"307021\" id=\"span_1\">(25)  The   next   important   question\t  that\t needs\t our\nconsideration is  whether the  death sentence awarded to the\nsix accused  persons, namely, A-1, A-2, A-4, A-5, A-8 and A-\n13 is in accordance with law and the guidelines laid by this\ncourt. The  earliest decision rendered by the Constitutional\nbench of  this Court  is in <a href=\"/doc/307021/\" id=\"a_34\">Bachan Singh Vs. State of Punjab</a>\n(1980) 2 SCC 684 this Court observed that in a case of death\nsentence the  facts and\t circumstances must indicate that it\nis a rarest of the rare case where extreme penalty is called\nfor. The court must pay due regard both to the crime and the\ncriminals. What\t is the\t relevant weight  to be given to the\naggravating and\t mitigating factors  depends upon  the facts\nand circumstances  of the  particular case.  The Court\tthen\nobserved: &quot;More\t often than  not, these\t two aspects  are so\nintertwined  that   it\tis  difficult  to  give\t a  separate\ntreatment to  each of them. This is so because `style is the\nman&#x27;. In  many cases,  the extremely cruel or beastly manner\nof the\tcommission of  murder is itself a demonstrated index\nof the\tdepraved character  of the perpetrator. That is why,\nit is  not desirable  to consider  the circumstances  of the\ncrime and  the circumstances of the criminal in two separate\nwater-tight compartments. In a sense, to kill is to be cruel\nand, therefore,\t all murders are cruel. But such cruelty may\nvary in\t its degree  of culpability. And it is only when the\nculpability assumes the proportion of extreme depravity that\n&quot;special reasons&quot;  can legitimately be said to exist&quot;. &quot;Life\nimprisonment is\t the rule and death sentence an exception. A\nreal and  abiding concern  for the  dignity  of\t human\tlife\npostulates  resistance\t to  taking  a\tlife  through  law&#x27;s\ninstrumentality. That ought not to be done save in he rarest\nof rare\t cases when the alternative option is unquestionably\nforeclosed&quot;. This  Court has  culled out  certain mitigating\ncircumstances to be considered at the time of exercising the\ndiscretion while awarding the extreme penalty.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"545301\" id=\"span_2\">(26) The next  two decisions  on the topic of death sentence\nare (<a href=\"/doc/545301/\" id=\"a_35\">i) Machhi Singh and Others vs. State of Punjab</a> (1983) 3\nSCC 470\t (ii) Allauddin\t Mian and  Others vs. State of Bihar\n(1989) 3  SCC 5.  We have  very carefully gone through these\ndecisions. In the light of these decisions we may now advert\nto the question of sentence.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">(27) Mr. A.K. Ganguli, Learned Senior Counsel contended that\nlife imprisonment  is the  rule and  death  sentence  is  an\nexception. There  is no reason to deviate from this rule. He\nrelied upon the above decisions of this Court on this topic.\nHe urged  that the  High Court had committed a serious error\nwhile accepting\t reference and confirming the death sentence\nawarded to  A-1, A-2, A-4 and A-13 and further enhancing the\nsentence of A-5, A-6 and A-8 from life imprisonment to death\nsentence to  each one  of them.\t He  urged  that  there\t are\nseveral mitigating  circumstances which militate against the\ndeath sentence\tawarded to  these accused and, therefore, it\nwould be  appropriate to  award life  imprisonment to  these\naccused persons.  The Learned  counsel then  pointed out the\nmitigating circumstances:  (i) Chandrika, the brother of A-1\nwas murdered  by Sheo  Pal and Ram Gulam who belonged to the\nparty of  Sukhdarshan (since deceased); (ii) it was a brutal\nmurder wherein Chandrika&#x27;s head was severed: (iii) no common\nobject could  be attributed  to\t the  unlawful\tassembly  to\ncommit the  murders in\tquestion; (iv)\tthe deceased persons\nand other  family members failed to disclose the whereabouts\nof Sheo\t Pal and  Ram Gulam  which caused  grave and  sudden\nprovocation and\t by reason  of such provocation the incident\nin question  might have\t happened; (v)\tsix accused  persons\nbelonging to  one family  have ben  sentenced to death; (vi)\nthe sentence  of death\tawarded to six accused persons would\nbe a  serious calamity\ton the surviving members of the said\nfamily; (vii)  all these condemned prisoners belonged to the\nage group  of 20  and 35 years except A-1, A-2 who were aged\nabout  45   and\t 40   years  respectively  at  the  time  of\noccurrence; (viii)  they  do  not  belong  to  the  type  of\nhardened  criminals   and,  therefore,\t they\tdeserve\t  an\nopportunity to reform themselves in their future life. While\nsupporting the\tdeath sentence\tof six\tabove named  accused\npersons, learned  counsel for  the State  urged that none of\nthese  circumstances   could  be  considered  as  mitigating\ncircumstances  to   commute  the   death  sentence  to\tlife\nimprisonment in\t facts and  circumstances of  this case.  He\nenumerated the\tcircumstances warranting  an extreme penalty\nand they  are (i)  after finding that Ram Gulam and Sheo Pal\nwere not hiding in the house of P.W.1, the unlawful assembly\nformed by  the accused\tpersons ought to have left the scene\nof occurrence;\t(i)  in\t Chandrika&#x27;s  murder,  none  of\t the\ndeceased was  involved; (iii)  there was no provocation from\nthe side  of deceased; (iv) the manner in which four persons\nwere done  to death was most brutal, heneous, ghastly and in\ntotal disregard\t to the\t human dignity; (v) was murders were\npre-planned; (vi)  the modus operandi was well thought of in\nadvance; (vii) of five four murders were committed in a most\nbarbaric manner.  Three heads  were severed  and an innocent\nboy of\tten years  was roasted alive in the smouldring fire;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">(viii) victory\tprocession with\t three heads raising slogans\n&quot;Shyam Manohar Zindabad&quot; etc. etc., and thereafter they went\ntowards the  house of  Chandrika; (ix) impact of terror upon\nthe minds of surviving members of the family of the deceased\npersons;  (x)  motive  coupled\twith  vengence\tand  revenge\nagainst innocent persons to satisfy the ego.\n(28)  We   have\t already   analysed  the   evidence  of\t the\nprosecution as\twell as\t the  defence.\tLook  at  the  modus\noperandi adopted  by  the  accused  persons  who  formed  an\nunlawful assembly  and its  common object  was not  only  to\ncommit the  murders of\tSheo Pal  and Ram Gulam but also the\ncommit the  mass murders  of family  members of\t Sukhdarshan\n(since deceased) as they were under the belief that Sheo Pal\nand Ram Gulam were hiding and taking shelter in the house or\nSukhdarshan. The  accused persons  first fired\tat  Kamlesh,\ninjured him  and thereafter opened the door and searched for\nRam Gulam and Sheo Pal. Kamlesh was immobilised by causing a\ngun shot  injury. Sukhdarshan  (since deceased)\t came out of\nhis room. He was fired at on a non-vital part by immbolizing\nhim and\t thereafter the\t accused persons  assaulted him with\nBanka; A-2, A-4 and A-13 held him facilitating A-1 to severe\nhis head.  The accused did not stop there but thereafter the\naccused persons\t assaulted him with Banka; A-2, A-4 and A-13\nheld him  facilitating A-1  to severe  his head. The accused\ndid not stop there but thereafter they fired at Surendra and\nassaulted him  by Bankas.  A-2, A-4  and A-13 caught hold of\nhim and\t A-1 severed  his head.\t Sandeep a  young boy  of 10\nyears when  came out  of the room which was then set on fire\nwas bodily  lifted by and A-5 and A-8 who threw him into the\nsmouldering fire.  He was  roasted alive.  Bhuwaneshwari who\nwas returning from the market was fired at and was given the\nsame cruel  treatment by  severing his head. This only shows\nthat they  were thirsty\t to severe  the heads from the alive\nbut injured bodies in order to take revenge of the murder of\nChandrika. All\tthe three heads were put together in a piece\nof cloth  and a\t victory procession was taken out by accused\ngiving slogans &quot;Shyam Manohar Zindabad; Nandlal and Premgiri\nZindabad etc.,\tetc.&quot;, and  then they  went to\tthe house of\nChandrika. A Simple question which requires to be considered\nis as to whether the conscience of a society was not shocked\nto see\tsuch ghastly and burtal murders? The accused persons\nhad shown  scant regard\t for the  human dignity. Upon taking\noverall view  of the circumstances in the light of the ratio\nlaid down  by this  Court in  the  aforesaid  judgments\t and\ntaking into  account the  manner  of  commission  of  crime,\nmotive for  commission of  crime and criminals, magnitude of\nthe crime  and little  regard for  the human  dignity and in\nparticular a young boy of 10 years.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">(29)  Now   let\t us  draw  a  final  balance  sheet  of\t the\naggravating and\t mitigating circumstances  after giving\t due\nconsideration to the rival contentions putforth before us as\nregards six  condemned prisoners.  In  our  considered\tview\njustification clearly  leans in\t favour of death sentence to\neach  of   the\tsix   condemned\t  prisoners.   Totality\t  of\ncircumstances outweighted  the mitigating  circumstances  as\npointed out by Mr. Ganguli. Sentence of life imprisonment to\nthese six accused persons would be totally inadequate in the\nfacts and  circumstances of  this case.\t The proved facts of\nthis  case  unmistakably  indicate  that  the  present\tcase\nsquarely falls\twithin the  ambit of  &quot;rarest of rare&quot; case.\nFive  murders\twere  committed\t  in  an  extremely  brutal,\ngrosteque, diabolical,\trevolting or  dastardly manner which\nwould  arouse\tintense\t and   extreme\tindignation  of\t the\ncommunity. Award  of lesser  punishment to these six accused\npersons would  disintegrate the\t rule of  law upon which the\nedific of our civilized society stands.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">(30) Having regard  to the  facts and  circumstances of this\ncase we\t are of\t the considered view that the High Court had\ncommitted no error whatsoever in awarding the death sentence\nto A-1,\t A-2, A-4, A-5, A-8 and A-13. None of the mitigating\ncircumstances placed  before us\t could persuade\t us to apply\nthe normal  rule of  life imprisonment\tin respect  of these\naccused persons.  It is in these circumstances we are of the\nconsidered view\t that Criminal\tAppeal Nos.  715-716 of 1997\nfiled by Sheo Ram (A-2) and Harish (a-4) as well as Criminal\nappeal Nos.  717-720 of\t 1997 filed  by Shyam Manohar (A-1),\nSuresh (A-13),\tPrakash (A-8) and Ravindra (A-5) are without\nany merit  and they  are consequently  dismissed.

Criminal Appeal  Nos. 721-24 of\n1997 filed  by Ram Pal Verma (A-24), Sankata (A-22), Mathura\nPrasad (A-21),\tDorey (A-23)  and Lalla (A-3) are dismissed.\nCriminal Appeal\t No.725 of  1997 filed by Rakesh Giri (A-11)\nand Rajesh  Giri (A-12)\t to stand dismissed.
