We have considered the objection raised by the appellants. It\nwould be germane to state that the objection regarding admissibility of\nthe call details was not raised by any of the appellants during the trial\nwhen the prosecution proposed it for admission. Even no questions\neither regarding its admissibility or regarding its genuineness or\nauthenticity were asked during cross-examination of the IO Akhilesh\nDwivedi, who proved the document before the trial Court. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"25220929\" id=\"span_19\">In a recent\njudgement in Sonu alias <a href=\"/doc/25220929/\" id=\"a_17\">Amar v. State of Haryana</a>, AIR 2017 SC\n3441, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held that CDRs of mobile phones\nrecovered from accused and exhibited before the Trial Court without\nobjection from defence amounts to waiver of necessity for insisting\nformal proof of documents. Such waiver from accused permissible even\nin criminal cases. The objection that the CDRs are unreliable being\nmarked without certificate as required by S. 65-B(4) cannot be raised at\nbelated stage since it relates to mode or method of proof of document.\nRelevant paras of the judgement reads thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           26.

The question that falls for our\n           consideration in this case is the permissibility of an objection regarding\n           inadmissibility at this stage. Admittedly, no objection was taken when the\n           CDRs were adduced in evidence before the Trial Court. It does not appear\n           from the record that any such objection was taken even at the appellate\n           stage before the High Court. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1541904\" id=\"span_20\">In <a href=\"/doc/1541904/\" id=\"a_19\">Gopal Das v.

A party cannot lie by until the case comes before a Court of\n   Appeal and then complain for the first time of the mode of proof.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">In RVE Venkatachala Gounder (AIR 2003 SC 4548), this Court held as\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">   &quot;Ordinarily an objection to the admissibility of evidence should be\n   taken when it is tendered and not subsequently. The objections as to\n   admissibility of documents in evidence may be classified into two\n   classes:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       (i) an objection that the document which is sought to be proved is\n       itself inadmissible in evidence; and (ii) where the objection does\n       not dispute the admissibility of the document in evidence but is\n       directed towards the mode of proof alleging the same to be\n       irregular or insufficient. In the first case, merely because a\n       document has been marked as &#x27;an exhibit&#x27;, an objection as to its\n       admissibility is not excluded and is available to be raised even at a\n       later stage or even in appeal or revision. In the latter case, the\n       objection should be taken before the evidence is tendered and once\n       the document has been admitted in evidence and marked as an\n       exhibit, the objection that it should not have been admitted in\n       evidence or that the mode adopted for proving the document is\n       irregular cannot be allowed to be raised at any stage subsequent to\n       the marking of the document as an exhibit. The later proposition is\n       a rule of fair play. The crucial test is whether an objection, if taken\n       at the appropriate point of time, would have enabled the party\n       tendering the evidence to cure the defect and resort to such mode\n       of proof as would be regular. The omission to object becomes fatal\n       because by his failure the party entitled to object allows the party\n       tendering the evidence to act on an assumption that the opposite\n       party is not serious about the mode of proof. On the other hand, a\n       prompt objection does not prejudice the party tendering the\n       evidence, for two reasons: firstly, it enables the Court to apply its\n       mind and pronounce its decision on the question of admissibility\n       then and there; and secondly, in the event of finding of the Court\n       on the mode of proof sought to be adopted going against the party\n       tendering the evidence, the opportunity of seeking indulgence of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                   18.</span>\n          HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n                CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n   CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\n         the Court for permitting a regular mode or method of proof and\n         thereby removing the objection raised by the opposite party, is\n         available to the party leading the evidence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1221542\" id=\"span_23\">Such practice and\n         procedure is fair to both the parties. Out of the two types of\n         objections, referred to hereinabove, in the later case, failure to raise\n         a prompt and timely objection amounts to waiver of the necessity\n         for insisting on formal proof of a document, the document itself\n         which is sought to be proved being admissible in evidence. In the\n         first case, acquiescence would be no bar to raising the objection in\n         superior Court.&quot;        [Emphasis supplied]\n\nIt would be relevant to refer to another case decided by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1221542/\" id=\"a_20\">P.C.\nPurshothama Reddiar v. S. Perumal</a> (1972) 1 SCC 9 : (AIR 1972 SC 608).</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">The earlier cases referred to are civil cases while this case pertains to police\nreports being admitted in evidence without objection during the trial. This\nCourt did not permit such an objection to be taken at the appellate stage by\nholding that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">         &quot;Before leaving this case it is necessary to refer to one of the\n         contentions taken by Mr. Ramamurthi, learned Counsel for the\n         respondent. He contended that the police reports referred to earlier\n         are inadmissible in evidence as the Head-constables who covered\n         those meetings have not been examined in the case. Those reports\n         were marked without any objection. Hence it is not open to the\n         respondent now to object to their admissibility.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">27. It is nobody&#x27;s case that CDRs which are a form of electronic record are\nnot inherently admissible in evidence. The objection is that they were\nmarked before the Trial Court without a certificate as required by Section\n65B (4). It is clear from the judgments referred to supra that an objection\nrelating to the mode or method of proof has to be raised at the time of\nmarking of the document as an exhibit and not later. The crucial test, as\naffirmed by this Court, is whether the defect could have been cured at the\nstage of marking the document. Applying this test to the present case, if an\nobjection was taken to the CDRs being marked without a certificate, the\nCourt could have given the prosecution an opportunity to rectify the\ndeficiency. It is also clear from the above judgments that objections\nregarding admissibility of documents which are per se inadmissible can be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                   19.</span>\n          HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n               CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n   CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\ntaken even at the appellate stage. Admissibility of a document which is\ninherently inadmissible is an issue which can be taken up at the appellate\nstage because it is a fundamental issue. The mode or method of proof is\nprocedural and objections, if not taken at the trial, cannot be permitted at the\nappellate stage. If the objections to the mode of proof are permitted to be\ntaken at the appellate stage by a party, the other side does not have an\nopportunity of rectifying the deficiencies. The learned Senior Counsel for\nthe State referred to statements under <a href=\"/doc/357596/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 161</a> of the Cr. P.C., 1973 as an\nexample of documents falling under the said category of inherently\ninadmissible evidence. CDRs do not fall in the said category of documents.\nWe are satisfied that an objection that CDRs are unreliable due to violation\nof the procedure prescribed in Section 65-B (4) cannot be permitted to be\nraised at this stage as the objection relates to the mode or method of proof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">28. Another point which remains to be considered is whether the accused is\ncompetent to waive his right to mode of proof. Mr. Luthra&#x27;s submission is\nthat such a waiver is permissible in civil cases and not in criminal cases. He\nrelies upon a judgment of the Privy Council in Chainchal Singh&#x27;s case (AIR\n1946 PC 1) in support of the proposition. The Privy Council held that the\naccused was not competent to waive his right. Chainchal Singh&#x27;s case may\nhave no application to the case in hand at all. In that case, the issue was\nunder <a href=\"/doc/800773/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 33</a> of the Evidence Act, and was whether evidence recorded\nin an earlier judicial proceeding could be read into, or not. The question was\nwhether the statements made by a witness in an earlier judicial proceeding\ncan be considered relevant for proving the truth or facts stated in a\nsubsequent judicial proceeding. <a href=\"/doc/800773/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 33</a> of the Evidence Act allows for\nthis inter alia where the witness is incapable of getting evidence in the\nsubsequent proceeding. In Chainchal Singh, the accused had not objected to\nthe evidence being read into in the subsequent proceeding. In this context,\nthe Privy Council held that in a civil case, a party can waive proof but in a\ncriminal case, strict proof ought to be given that the witness is incapable of\ngiving evidence. Moreover, the Judge must be satisfied that the witness\ncannot give evidence. Chainchal Singh also held that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">         &quot;In a civil case a party can, if he chooses, waive the proof, but in a\n         criminal case strict proof ought to be given that the witness is\n         incapable of giving evidence&quot;.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                  20.</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">          HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n               CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n   CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\nThe witness, who had deposed earlier, did not appear in the subsequent\nproceeding on the ground that he was unable to move from his house\nbecause of tuberculosis, as deposed by the process server. There was no\nmedical evidence in this regard. The Court observed that the question of\nwhether or not he was incapable of giving evidence must be proved in this\ncontext, and in the proof of such a fact it was a condition that statements\ngiven in an earlier proceeding can be taken as proved in a subsequent\nproceeding. Chainchal Singh&#x27;s case therefore, does not lay down a general\nproposition that an accused cannot waive an objection of mode of proof in a\ncriminal case. In the present case, there is a clear failure to object to the\nmode of proof of the CDRs and the case is therefore covered by the test in\nR.V.E. Venkatachala Gounder (AIR 2003 SC 4548).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">29. We proceed to deal with the submission of Mr. Luthra that the ratio of\nthe judgment of the Bombay High Court in Shaikh Farid&#x27;s case (1983 Cri LJ\n487 (Bom) (FB)) is not applicable to the facts of this case. It was held in\nShaikh Farid&#x27;s case as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">   &quot;6. In civil cases mode of proof can be waived by the person against\n whom it is sought to be used. Admission thereof or failure to raise\n objection to their tendering in evidence amount to such waiver. No such\n waiver from the accused was permissible in criminal cases till the\n enactment of the present <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_24\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> in 1973. The\n accused was supposed to be a silent spectator at the trial, being under no\n obligation to open his mouth till the occasion to record his statement under\n section 342 (present S. 313) of the Code arose. Even then he was not\n bound to answer and explain the circumstances put to him as being\n appearing against him. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"196801\" id=\"span_26\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/196801/\" id=\"a_25\">Chainchal Singh v. Emperor</a>, AIR\n 1946 PC 1 it was held by the Privy Council that the accused was not\n competent to waive his right and the obligation of the prosecution to prove\n the documents on which the prosecution relied. Resultantly, the\n prosecution was driven to examine witnesses even when the accused was\n not interested in challenging the facts sought to be proved though them.\n The inconvenience and the delay was avoidable.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\"> 7. Section 294 of the Code is introduced to dispense with this avoidable\n waste of time and facilitate removal of such obstruction in the speedy trial.\n The accused is now enabled to waive the said right and save the time. This\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                 21.</span>\n        HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n             CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\nis a new provision having no corresponding provision in the repealed\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_26\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>. It requires the prosecutor or the accused, as\nthe case may be, to admit or deny the genuineness of the document sought\nto be relied against him at the outset in writing. On his admitting or\nindicating no dispute as to the genuineness, the Court is authorised to\ndispense with its formal proof thereof. In fact after indication of no dispute\nas to the genuineness, proof of documents is reduced to a sheer empty\nformality. The section is obviously aimed at undoing the judicial view by\nlegislative process.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">8. The preceding Section 293 of the Code also dispenses with the proof of\ncertain documents. It corresponds with Section 510 of the repealed <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_27\">Code\nof Criminal Procedure</a>. It enumerates the category of documents, proof of\nwhich is not necessary unless the Court itself thinks it necessary. Section\n294 makes dispensation of formal proof dependent on the accused or the\nprosecutor, not disputing the genuineness of the documents sought to be\nused against them. Such contemplated dispensation is not restricted to any\nclass or category of documents as under section 293, in which ordinarily\nauthenticity is dependent more on the mechanical process involved than\non the knowledge, observation or the skill of the author rendering oral\nevidence just formal. Nor it is made dependent on the relative importance\nof the document or probative value thereof. The documents being primary\nor secondary or substantive or corroborative, is not relevant for attracting\nSec. 294 of the Code. Not disputing its genuineness is the only solitary test\ntherefor.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\"> 9. Now the post-mortem report is also a document as any other\ndocument. Primary evidence of such a document is the report itself. It is a\ncontemporaneous record, prepared in the prescribed form, of what the\ndoctor has noticed in the course of post-mortem of the dead body, while\ninvestigation the cause of the death. It being relevant, it can be proved by\nproducing the same. But production is only a step towards proof of it. It\ncan be received in evidence only on the establishment of its authenticity\nby the mode of its proof as provided under <a href=\"/doc/884542/\" id=\"a_28\">sections 67</a> to <a href=\"/doc/693536/\" id=\"a_29\">71</a> of the\nEvidence Act. Section 294(1) of the Code enables the accused also, to\nwaive this mode of proof, by admitting it or raising no dispute as to its\ngenuineness when called upon to do so under sub-section (1). Sub-section\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                             22.</span>\n                    HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n                         CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n             CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\n            (3) enables the Court to read it in evidence without requiring the same to\n            be proved in accordance with the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_30\">Evidence Act</a>. There is nothing in\n            Section 294 to justify exclusion of it, from the purview of &quot;documents&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">            covered thereby.

The judgment in Shaikh Farid&#x27;s\n          case (1983 Cri LJ 487 (Bom) (FB)) is not applicable to the facts of this case\n          and so, is not relevant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"187283766\" id=\"span_29\">30.

These arrests have not been challenged by\nthe appellants. IO Mr. Dwivedi PW/52 and S.D.O., Khargone G.S.\nDodia PW-44 (both in ST 63/10) have stated that Mr. Dwivedi sent a\nrequest to Mr. Dodiya to conduct identification of the accused Juber,\nRamjan S/o Kallu @ Chhota Ramjan and Shafique. After arrest of\nthe accused Munna @ Shahnwaj, the Executive Magistrate Tehsildar,\nKhargone Vivek Sonkar PW-32 (ST 35/12) conducted his identification.\nOn 18/10/2011 and submitted its report to the SHO alongwith letter\nEx.P/55. On both these occasions, the witnesses Suresh Mahajan, Bihari\nand Ramkrishna (PW-1,3,5 ST No.63/10) identified them (EX.P-88, 89\n&amp; 90). These witnesses have also identified them (Juber, Ramjan S/o\nKallu @ Chhota Ramjan, Shafique and Munna @ Shahnwaj) in Court.\nApart from that the eye-witnesses Jeetu @ Jitendra Kushwaha and\ncotton broker Manoj Shikari (PW-11 &amp; 14) have identified accused\nShafeeq, Sunil Bhilala (PW-12) has identified accused Shafeeq and\nJuber and driver Manish Raghuvanshi (PW-13) has identified Shafeeq,\nJuber, Chhota Ramjan and Munna @ Shahnwaj also in the Court giving\ndetails of the part played by all of them. Eye-witness Ratanlal (PW-8,\nST No.35/12) has also identified accused Munna @ Shahnwaj in Court.\nDespite adroit efforts to testify their testimony from all possible angles\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                        26.</span>\n                  HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n                      CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n            CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\non the anvil of the cross-examination, their credibility could not be\nshaken.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">35.   It is pertinent to mention here that the accused Munna @ Shahnwaj\nand Shafeeq are residents of U.P. (Munna Village- Karoli Khurd, Police\nStation Saraimir district Aajamgarh &amp; Shafeeq Village Pahadpur, P.S.\nPurva Bazar, District Gorakhpur). Soon before the incident, they came\nand stayed in a hotel at Khargone. The then SHO, Chhatarpal Singh\nParihar and Manager of Hotel Metro, Khargone, Gulsher Khan and\nwitness Santosh (PW-29, 16 &amp; 17 ST No.35/12) have stated that after\ndisclosure of Munna @ Shahnwaj that before committing the incident he\nstayed in Metro Hotel, Khargone for two days, Shri Parihar seized guest\nregister of Hotel Metro, Khargone. As per entry of this register dated\n09.12.2009, the accused Munna @ Shahnwaj stayed in room no.204 for\ntwo days with Shafeeq. In identification parade conducted by the\nTehsildar Vivek Sonkar (PW-32), Manager Gulsher Khan was also\ncalled to identify Shahnwaj and he identified him during identification\nparade in jail and also during his examination before the Court. Their\nstatements, which are supported by identification memo (Ex.P/2) also,\nremained intact even after cross-examination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"128095983\" id=\"span_34\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"67702106\" id=\"span_35\">36. It is vehemently argued by the learned defence counsels that to\nconstitute offence under <a href=\"/doc/958439/\" id=\"a_33\">section 396</a> of the IPC presence and\nparticipation of 5 or more persons is necessary, while in the present case\npresence of only 3 persons is mentioned in the Dehati Nalishi and in the\nFIR. The eye witnesses have stated presence of only 4 persons. In that\ncase, the offence charged with, cannot be constituted. It is further\ncontended that charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_34\">section 302</a> IPC is not framed against the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                        27.</span>\n                  HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n                      CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n            CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\naccused persons; therefore, in case of failure of charge under <a href=\"/doc/958439/\" id=\"a_35\">section 396</a>\nIPC, they cannot be punished under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_36\">section 302</a> IPC also.

In view of the argument of the learned counsel, we revisited the\nevidence produced by the prosecution before the learned trial court. Sub-\nInspector Surya Dutt Tiwari (PW-50) has stated that on the date of\nincident he received information through control room that some\nincident of loot is going on at Rajshree Ginning Factory and the robbers\nare also firing there. On receiving this information, he with Station In-\ncharge Akhilesh Dwivedi, ASI Dixit, ASI Solanki some head-constables\nand constables immediately rushed towards the place of incident. The\npolice launched search operation. Different police parties spread in\ndifferent areas. Some police personals started searching the culprits on\nNagjhari road, some on Amarkhali road and some on Bistan road. Amar\nSingh (PW-23) has stated that on 12.12.2009, at about 12:30 - 12:45 he\nwas preparing his farm for sowing wheat he saw that two motorcycles\nwith pillion rider were coming at abnormal high speed, which may be\n80-90 kmph from Khargone side and going towards Piperkhedi. On one\nmotorcycle, pillion rider was holding a grey colour bag in his hand.\nAfter 15-20 minutes, he saw that Mohammad Patel was also coming\nfrom Khargone and going towards Piperkhedi. He was also in hurry. He\nidentified him in court as he was known to him because he used to come\nat the factory in relation to his business of packaging bags (bardana)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                        28.</span>\n                  HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n                      CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n            CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\nwith the factory. So far as relation of Mohammad with the factory is\nconcern, Manoj (PW-15) has also supported the statement of Amar\nSingh and further by giving a suggestion to the IO Mr. Dwivedi (para 68\nof the cross examination), he has admitted that he is in the business of\nBardana. They both have remained intact even after cross-examination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_53\">38. I.O. Akhilesh Dwivedi has stated that immediately after the\nincident the police cordoned the area. Various police parties were\ndeployed on all possible escape routes of the culprits. On 16.12.2009, he\nreceived information that Juber and Mohammad Patel are dissipating the\nbooty. He cordoned the area and took Juber in custody from bus-stand.\nOn interrogation, he disclosed names of his accomplices. After\ncompleting recovery and other necessary formalities, he arrested Babloo\n@ Tasleem and thereafter took Mohammad Patel in custody from his\nhouse. They all revealed that they hatched conspiracy of the loot at the\nhouse of Juber. Mohammad Patel, who was acquainted with the working\nof the factory due to his business of packaging bags (Bardana), gave full\ninformation to his accomplices regarding functioning and money\ntransactions of the factory. He was assigned duty to support the culprits\nfrom outside. It is apposite to keep in mind that the accused Munna @\nShahnwaj and Shafeeq who invaded the factory were from Azamgarh\nand Gorakhpur of district U.P. They were not aware of the locality and\nwere in need of a local assistance, which Mohammad provided them and\nhe worked for them as a guide or pointer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">39.   Mohammad Patel received Rs. 10.55 lacs in the looted cash for the\npart played by him, which were recovered later from his possession on\nthe basis of information given by him.

This\nestablished that the currency notes recovered from the house of\nMohammad were stolen property. No explanation is submitted by him.\nThis all establishes his involvement in the crime. From all this chain of\ncircumstances, it emerges that behind the curtain, Mohammad Patel was\nalso present on the spot at the time of the incident. Therefore, it cannot\nbe said that at the time of the incident five or more persons were not\nconjoint in committing the offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">40.   Manoj PW/15 has stated that Mohammad was not present on the\nspot, but at the time of incident, he (Manoj) was sitting in the office\ncabin of the factory with owner Suresh Mahajan, while presence of\nMohammad appears to be at the outside of the factory, therefore, his\nstatement does not affect adversely the statement of Amar Singh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_56\">41. Suresh Mahajan, who lodged Dehati Nalashi was sitting inside the\noffice. Only one miscreant entered in the office, he fired gun shots on\nthe deceased, snatched bag from him, fired gun shots on the persons who\ntried to intervene and ran outside with the bag containing Rs.50 lacs.\nEntire incident happened within 4-5 minutes. Suresh has first seen the\nincident happened inside the office. It is quite possible that he could not\nsee all the culprits standing outside from the window of his office. It has\ncome in the evidence that at the time of the incident the factory was in\noperation and many people were present in the premises of the factory in\nrespect of their routine business. It is quite natural that in an unexpected\nincident one cannot recognize as to who among the many persons\npresent there is companion of the culprits. Suresh himself was injured;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                        30.</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">                  HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n                       CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n            CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\neven then he immediately tried to chase the offenders, but did not find\nthem. He came back, made arrangements to send the injured and the\ndeceased to the hospital and thereafter lodged the report. All the\nwitnesses who have seen the incident from outside the office when they\nwere standing in the factory premises were in a position to see all the\npersons who were involve in the attack. Their testimony was well tested\non the anvil of the cross-examination, but they stand up with their\nstatements. Fifth miscreant was guided the way to the accomplice, he did\nnot enter in the factory and he disappeared from the scene of incident\nafter his job was over. His presence on the spot was proved by another\nwitness Amar Singh as discussed in preceding paras. Thus, ostensibly\nsome discrepancy in the number of miscreants appears in the statement\nof the witnesses, but in fact that is not a discrepancy as all the witnesses\nhave revealed the true facts which they had seen and total effect of their\nstatement is neither contradictory nor unbelievable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">42. Though, in the peculiar facts of the present case, it is not necessary\nto consider as to whether the appellants can be convicted for the offence\npunishable under Section 302 even in absence of specific charge, as in\nthe present case presence of 5 dacoits, necessary to constitute the\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/958439/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 396</a> of the IPC, is well established, but we think it\nproper to satisfy the question raised before us. The reply can be gathered\nfrom the judgement of the constitutional bench of Hon&#x27;ble the Supreme\nCourt. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1988749\" id=\"span_40\">In <a href=\"/doc/1988749/\" id=\"a_40\">Shyam Behari v.

It is, however, unnecessary to do so because in the\n                 facts and circumstances of the present case the appellant\n                 is liable to be convicted of the offence under Section 302\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                            <a href=\"/doc/821945/\" id=\"a_41\">31</a>.</span>\n      HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n          CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\nCRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_42\">Indian Penal Code</a> without anything more. The charge\n     under <a href=\"/doc/958439/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 396</a>, Indian Penal Code comprised of two\n     ingredients:-(1) the commission of the dacoity, and (2)\n     the commission of the murder in so committing the\n     dacoity. The first ingredient was proved without any\n     doubt and was not challenged by the learned counsel for\n     the appellant. The second ingredient also was proved in\n     any event as regards the commission of the murder\n     because the attention of the accused was focused not only\n     on the commission of the offence while committing the\n     dacoity but also on the individual part which he took in\n     the commission of that murder. So far as he was\n     concerned, he knew from the charge which was framed\n     against him that he was sought to be made responsible\n     not only for the commission of the dacoity but also for\n     the commission of the murder in committing such\n     dacoity. The evidence which was led on behalf of the\n     prosecution specifically implicated him and he was\n     named by the prosecution witnesses as the person who\n     shot at Mendai while crossing the ditch of the Pipra\n     Farm. His examination under <a href=\"/doc/697591/\" id=\"a_44\">section 342</a> of the Criminal\n     Procedure Code also brought out that point specifically\n     against him and he was questioned in that behalf. Both\n     the Courts below recorded their concurrent findings of\n     fact in regard to the part taken by the appellant in the\n     commission of the murder of Mendai. Under these\n     circumstances it could not be urged that the appellant\n     could not be convicted of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 302</a>,\n     Indian Penal Code if such a charge could be made out\n     against him (Vide our decision in Willie (William)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                         32.</span>\n                   HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n                       CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n             CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\n                  Slaney v.

The Hon&#x27;ble Apex court has again consider the question as to\nwhether the accused, who charged for offence u/S. 396 alone can be\nconvicted for offence u/S. 302 without alteration of charge and as to\nwhether murder is integral part of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/958439/\" id=\"a_46\">section 396</a> IPC in\n<a href=\"/doc/105261366/\" id=\"a_47\">Rafiq Ahmed @ Rafi v.

But in\nthe present case, as discussed above, 5 persons conjointly committed\ndacoity, therefore, no finding on this issue is required at our level.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">44. In the cases of Manmeet Singh, Rajkumar @ Raju, Ibrahim,\nKallu @ Rajkumar and Reechchoo (Supra) it is held that to constitute\nthe offence under Section 396 essential pre-requisite is joint\nparticipation of five or more persons in commission of the offence of\ndacoity and the prosecution could not establish this, therefore, the\nappellants cannot be convicted for the offence<a href=\"/doc/958439/\" id=\"a_48\"> u/s 396</a> IPC. But, in the\npresent case, as discussed above, presence of five persons while\ncommitting robbery, is proved, therefore, these citations are not much\nhelpful to the appellants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">45.   The learned counsels expressed their suspicion towards the fact\nthat the number of currency notes were written on the back of the\ncheque, which according to them is an unusual practice. But in this case\nthe cheque was recovered on 13/12/2009 with the number of notes\nmention on the back, while the currency notes were recovered on 16,17\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                          33.</span>\n                    HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n                        CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n              CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\n&amp; 21/12/2009, therefore it cannot be said an antedated entry. Besides,\nleaving no room for doubts, the statements of the bank officers have\nremained intact in this regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">46.   The Learned counsels for the defence drew our attention toward\nopinion of the Add. State Examiner of Questioned Documents, Govt. of\nM.P., Bhopal Ex.D/14. In his report, after comparing both writings\nrelating to denomination of the currency notes delivered and their unique\nnumbers written on the back of the cheque, which was encashed by the\nbank, the State Examiner has opined that definite opinion regarding the\ncommon authorship of above said two sets of writing cannot be\nexpressed. But this opinion does not trash the case of the prosecution as\nwhile comparing both the writings, the State Examiner observed that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">            &quot;The original document of this case have been carefully and\n            thoroughly examined.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      I. When the writing, written as amount, on the back of a disputed cheque\n      marked Ex-P-6 have been carefully and thoroughly examined, under\n      different arrangements of light, the following facts have been observed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      (1) When the writing viewed under sun light, U.V. light and I.R. light, the\n      ink emits similar fluorescence, at all the portions written as amount, means\n      similar ink is used in the execution of writing written as amount.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">      (2)   The writing existing in column No.I, II and III, show internal\n      consistency among it. Movement and formation of digit, 4, 5, 8, 2 and\n      compression of zero with variation, which are commonly available for\n      comparison, revels this fact, including the writing marked &#x27;F to F&#x27; and this\n      writing seemed to be differ only due to small size of digits.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      (3) Though the standard writing marked S1 to S10 show characteristics\n      similarities with the questioned writing of Ex-P-6, which is written as\n      amount on the back of a cheque, but as the admitted similar writing of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                         34.</span>\n                   HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n                       CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n             CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\n      writer of S1 to S10 is not available for comparison, specimen writing\n      marked S1 to S10 is written mostly in combination, providing wider space\n      giving different appearance and more over questioned writing is written with\n      the help of letters C, S, B, V, H, T and digits only, most of them has\n      common characteristics of writing. Under these circumstances, definite\n      opinion regarding the common authorship of above said two sets of\n      writing can not be expressed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">47.   Thus, many similarities were observed by the Examiner on almost\nall the material parameters, and only due to technical limitations or some\nshortcomings definite opinion could not be given but this does not mean\nthat both the writings were different and this makes the case doubtful\nparticularly when we see that there was no occasion for the bank officers\nto mention the numbers of the currency note as the cheque was seized\nmuch prior to the seizure of the currency notes from the appellants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">48. The defence took us to the statements of the witnesses examined\nby the prosecution before the trial Court and submits that there are many\nimprobabilities, discrepancies, contradiction and omissions in their\ndepositions.

But in the case in\nhand, no such shortcomings or irregularities could be pointed out. In this\ncase the accused were arrested on 16,17 &amp; 20/12/2009 and the\nidentification parade was conducted on 29/01/2010. The accused Munna\n@ Shahnawaz was arrested on 27.09.2011 (Ex.P-54) and the\nidentification was conducted on 18.10.2011 (Ex.P-55). No evidence that\nthe witnesses got any opportunity to see the culprits before facing them\nin the identification parade conducted by the executive magistrates. The\nstatements of witnesses both, who conducted the parade or who\nidentified the culprits were tested by the defence at length, but no fault\ncould be brought on record. Therefore, the case of the prosecution\nremains credible.</span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_66\">50. Thus, it is well established that the accused Juber, Ramjan @\nChhota Ramjan S/o Kallu, Shafeeq, Munna @ Shahnwaj and\nMohammad Patel were seen by the witnesses on the spot while\ncommitting the crime and later they were identified by them, Pistols\nwhich were used in the crime and the bag looted in the incident were\nrecovered from possession of the accused Juber, Baliram and Shafeeq\nand the cash looted in the crime was recovered from all the appellants,\nwhich was identified by the witnesses, establishes involvement of the\nappellants in the alleged crime beyond all reasonable doubts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_67\">51.   Unrebutted testimony of the Arms Clerk Gajendra Singh PW/29 is\nsufficient to establish the sanction for prosecution of the accused person\nfor the charge under <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_54\">section 25(1B) (a)</a> of the Arms Act, 1959 granted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                         37.</span>\n                   HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n                       CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n             CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\nby the District Magistrate (Ex.P/69).

The language of Section 354(3) demonstrates the legislative concern\nand the conditions which need to be satisfied prior to imposition of death\npenalty. The words, &quot;in the case of sentence of death, the special reasons\nfor such sentence&quot; unambiguously demonstrate the command of the\nlegislature that such reasons have to be recorded for imposing the\npunishment of death sentence. This is how the concept of the rarest of rare\ncases has emerged in law. Viewed from that angle, both the legislative\nprovisions and judicial pronouncements are at ad idem in law. The death\npenalty should be imposed in the rarest of rare cases and that too for special\nreasons to be recorded. To put it simply, a death sentence is not a rule but\nan exception. Even the exception must satisfy the pre-requisites\ncontemplated under Section 354(3), Cr.

Similarly, the intensity of bitterness which prevailed and the\nescalation of simmering thoughts into a thirst for revenge and retaliation\nwere also considered to be a relevant factor by this Court in different cases.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1724804\" id=\"span_66\">39. This Court in Satishbhushan Bariyar also considered various doctrines,\nprinciples and factors which would be considered by the Courts while\ndealing with such cases. The Court discussed in some elaboration the\napplicability of the doctrine of rehabilitation and the doctrine of prudence.\nWhile considering the application of the doctrine of rehabilitation and the\nextent of weightage to be given to the mitigating circumstances, it noticed\nthe nature of the evidence and the background of the accused. The\nconviction <a href=\"/doc/1724804/\" id=\"a_86\">in that case</a> was entirely based upon the statement of the\napprover and was a case purely of circumstantial evidence. Thus, applying\nthe doctrine of prudence, it noticed the fact that the accused were\nunemployed, young men in search of job and they were not criminals. In\nexecution of a plan proposed by the appellant and accepted by others, they\nkidnapped a friend of theirs. The kidnapping was done with the motive of\nprocuring ransom from his family but later they murdered him because of\nthe fear of getting caught, and later cut the body into pieces and disposed it\noff at different places. One of the accused had turned approver and as\nalready noticed, the conviction was primarily based upon the statement of\nthe approver.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">40. Basing its reasoning on the application of doctrine of prudence and the\nversion put forward by the accused, the Court, while declining to award\ndeath penalty and only awarding life imprisonment, held as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1312651\" id=\"span_67\">(<a href=\"/doc/1312651/\" id=\"a_87\">Satishbhushan Bariyar</a> case (AIR 2010 SC (Supp) 612 : 2010 AIR SCW\n1130), SCC pp. 551 and 559-60, paras 135, 168-69 and 171-73) : (Paras\n140, 173,174 and 177 to 180 of AIR, AIR SCW)\n       &quot;135. Right to life, in its barest of connotation would imply right to\n       mere survival. In this form, right to life is the most fundamental of\n       all rights. Consequently, a punishment which aims at taking away\n       life is the gravest punishment. Capital punishment imposes a\n       limitation on the essential content of the fundamental right to life,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                               43.</span>\n       HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n            CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\n       eliminating it irretrievably. We realise the absolute nature of this\n       right, in the sense that it is a source of all other rights. Other rights\n       may be limited, and may even be withdrawn and then granted again,\n       but their ultimate limit is to be found in the preservation of the right\n       to life. Right to life is the essential content of all rights under the\n       Constitution. If life is taken away, all other rights cease to exist.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\">                             ***\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">168. We must, however, add that in a case of this nature where the entire\nprosecution case revolves round the statement of an approver or is\ndependant upon the circumstantial evidence, the prudence doctrine should\nbe invoked. For the aforementioned purpose, at the stage of sentencing\nevaluation of evidence would not be permissible, the courts not only have\nto solely depend upon the findings arrived at for the purpose of recording a\njudgment of conviction, but also consider the matter keeping in view the\nevidences which have been brought on record on behalf of the parties and\nin particular the accused for imposition of a lesser punishment. A statement\nof approver in regard to the manner in which crime has been committed\nvis-?is the role played by the accused, on the one hand, and that of the\napprover, on the other, must be tested on the touchstone of the prudence\ndoctrine.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_93\">169. The accused persons were not criminals. They were friends. The\ndeceased was said to have been selected because his father was rich. The\nmotive, if any, was to collect some money. They were not professional\nkillers. They have no criminal history. All were unemployed and were\nsearching for jobs. Further, if age of the accused was a relevant factor for\nthe High Court for not imposing death penalty on Accused 2 and 3, the\nsame standard should have been applied to the case of the appellant also\nwho was only two years older and still a young man in age. Accused 2 and\n3 were as much a part of the crime as the appellant. Though it is true, that it\nwas he who allegedly proposed the idea of kidnapping, but at the same time\nit must not be forgotten that the said plan was only executed when all the\npersons involved gave their consent thereto.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_94\">                             ***\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_95\">171. <a href=\"/doc/324405/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 354(3)</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure requires that when\nthe conviction is for an offence punishable with death or in the alternative\nwith imprisonment for life or imprisonment for a term of years, the\njudgment shall state the reasons for the sentence awarded, and in the case of\nsentence of death, the special reasons thereof. We do not think that the\nreasons assigned by the courts below disclose any special reason to uphold\nthe death penalty. The discretion granted to the courts must be exercised\nvery cautiously especially because of the irrevocable character of death\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                               44.</span>\n       HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n            CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\npenalty. Requirements of law to assign special reasons should not be\nconstrued to be an empty formality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\">172. We have previously noted that the judicial principles for imposition of\ndeath penalty are far from being uniform. Without going into the merits and\ndemerits of such discretion and subjectivity, we must nevertheless reiterate\nthe basic principle, stated repeatedly by this Court, that life imprisonment is\nthe rule and death penalty an exception. Each case must therefore be\nanalysed and the appropriateness of punishment determined on a case-by-\ncase basis with death sentence not to be awarded save in the &#x27;rarest of the\nrare&#x27; case where reform is not possible. Keeping in mind at least this\nprinciple we do not think that any of the factors in the present case\ndiscussed above warrants the award of the death penalty. There are no\nspecial reasons to record the death penalty and the mitigating factors in the\npresent case, discussed previously, are, in our opinion, sufficient to place it\nout of the &#x27;rarest of rare&#x27; category.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_97\">173. For the reasons aforementioned, we are of the opinion that this is not a\ncase where death penalty should be imposed. The appellant, therefore,\ninstead of being awarded death penalty, is sentenced to undergo rigorous\nimprisonment for life. Subject to the modification in the sentence of the\nappellant (A-1) mentioned hereinbefore, both the appeals of the appellant as\nalso that of the State are dismissed.&quot;          (Emphasis in original)\n&quot;41. The above principle, as supported by case illustrations, clearly depicts\nthe various precepts which would govern the exercise of judicial discretion\nby the courts within the parameters spelt out under Section 354(3), Cr. P.C.\nAwarding of death sentence amounts to taking away the life of an\nindividual, which is the most valuable right available, whether viewed from\nthe constitutional point of view or from the human rights point of view. The\ncondition of providing special reasons for awarding death penalty is not to\nbe construed linguistically but it is to satisfy the basic features of a\nreasoning supporting and making award of death penalty unquestionable.\nThe circumstances and the manner of committing the crime should be such\nthat it pricks the judicial conscience of the court to the extent that the only\nand inevitable conclusion should be awarding of death penalty.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">28.

These considerations further\ndemonstrate that the matter has to be examined with reference to a\nparticular case, for instance, murder of an innocent child who could not\nhave or has not provided even an excuse, much less a provocation for\nmurder.

Now, we may notice the cases which were relied upon by the learned\ncounsel appearing for the appellants and wherein this Court had declined to\nconfirm the imposition of capital punishment treating them not to be the\nrarest of rare cases.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1099363\" id=\"span_71\">34. In Ronny alias Ronald James Alwaris Etc. v. State of Maharashtra\n[(1998) 3 SCC 625 : (AIR 1998 SC 1251 : 1998 AIR SCW 1103)], the\nCourt while relying upon the judgment of this Court in the case of\n<a href=\"/doc/1099363/\" id=\"a_90\">Allauddin Mian and Ors. v. State of Bihar</a> [(1989) 3 SCC 5 : (AIR 1989 SC\n1456)], held that the choice of the death sentence has to be made only in the\n&#x27;rarest of rare&#x27; cases and that where culpability of the accused has assumed\ndepravity or where the accused is found to be an ardent criminal and\nmenace to the society. The Court also noticed the above-stated principle\nthat the Court should ordinarily impose a lesser punishment and not the\nextreme punishment of death which should be reserved for exceptional\ncases only. The Court, while considering the cumulative effect of all the\nfactors such as the offences not committed under the influence of extreme\nmental or emotional disturbance and the fact that the accused were young\nand the possibility of their reformation and rehabilitation could not be ruled\nout, converted death sentence into life imprisonment.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">35. ...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">36. The above judgments provide us with the dicta of the Court relating to\nimposition of death penalty. Merely because a crime is heinous per se may\nnot be a sufficient reason for the imposition of death penalty without\nreference to the other factors and attendant circumstances.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">37. Most of the heinous crimes under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_91\">IPC</a> are punishable by death\npenalty or life imprisonment. That by itself does not suggest that in all such\noffences, penalty of death alone should be awarded. We must notice, even\nat the cost of repetition, that in such cases awarding of life imprisonment\nwould be a rule, while &#x27;death&#x27; would be the exception. The term &#x27;rarest of\nrare&#x27; case which is the consistent determinative rule declared by this Court,\nitself suggests that it has to be an exceptional case. The life of a particular\nindividual cannot be taken away except according to the procedure\nestablished by law and that is the constitutional mandate.

Since, the later judgments of this Court have added to the principles\nstated by this Court in the case of Bachan Singh (AIR 1980 SC 898) (supra)\nand Machhi Singh (AIR 1983 SC 957) (supra), it will be useful to re-state\nthe stated principles while also bringing them in consonance, with the\nrecent judgments.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1235094\" id=\"span_73\">39.

Stated broadly, these are the accepted indicators for the exercise of\njudicial discretion but it is always preferred not to fetter the judicial\ndiscretion by attempting to make the excessive enumeration, in one way or\nanother. In other words, these are the considerations which may collectively\nor otherwise weigh in the mind of the Court, while exercising its\njurisdiction. It is difficult to state it as an absolute rule. Every case has to be\ndecided on its own merits. The judicial pronouncements, can only state the\nprecepts that may govern the exercise of judicial discretion to a limited\nextent. Justice may be done on the facts of each case. These are the factors\nwhich the Court may consider in its endeavour to do complete justice\nbetween the parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_107\">42. The Court then would draw a balance-sheet of aggravating and\nmitigating circumstances. Both aspects have to be given their respective\nweightage. The Court has to strike a balance between the two and see\ntowards which side the scale/balance of justice tilts. The principle of\nproportion between the crime and the punishment is the principle of &#x27;just\ndeserts&#x27; that serves as the foundation of every criminal sentence that is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                          49.</span>\n                  HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n                       CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n            CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\n           justifiable. In other words, the &#x27;doctrine of proportionality&#x27; has a valuable\n           application to the sentencing policy under the Indian criminal\n           jurisprudence. Thus, the court will not only have to examine what is just but\n           also as to what the accused deserves keeping in view the impact on the\n           society at large.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_108\">           43. Every punishment imposed is bound to have its effect not only on the\n           accused alone, but also on the society as a whole. Thus, the Courts should\n           consider retributive and deterrent aspect of punishment while imposing the\n           extreme punishment of death.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_109\">           44. Wherever, the offence which is committed, manner in which it is\n           committed, its attendant circumstances and the motive and status of the\n           victim, undoubtedly brings the case within the ambit of &#x27;rarest of rare&#x27; cases\n           and the Court finds that the imposition of life imprisonment would be\n           inflicting of inadequate punishment, the Court may award death penalty.\n           Wherever, the case falls in any of the exceptions to the &#x27;rarest of rare&#x27; cases,\n           the Court may exercise its judicial discretion while imposing life\n           imprisonment in place of death sentence.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_110\">58.

As we have seen above that when a court awards a death sentence,\nthe judgment shall state the special reasons. But there are no special\nreasons assigned by the learned trial Court to record the death penalty.\nWe have considered them in the backdrop of the facts. In the present\ncase, the offender suddenly swooped on the bag which the deceased was\ncarrying. On resistance he shot the resistor and fled away with the bag\ncontaining cash. He did not shot the other persons present on the spot\nwith intent to kill them. His motive was not to cause death but was to\nrob the money. The co-offenders also fired gunshot to deter the persons\ncoming in their way to make a way to escape. Their plan was not to\ncommit murder but was to commit dacoity. Its not a case of barbaric and\nbrutal murder. The offenders were not professional killers. They have no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                            50.</span>\n                      HIGH COURT OF M.P., BENCH AT INDORE\n                          CRIMINAL REFRENCE No.01/2017,\n\n                CRA Nos.447, 461, 514, 521, 560, 625, 1600 of 2013 &amp; 696/17\n\n\n\n\n    criminal history. The entire prosecution case is dependent upon the\n    circumstantial evidence. In a case of this nature, the doctrine of\n    prudence should be invoked. Considering the nature, motive, manner\n    and impact of the crime, culpability, quality of evidence, socio-\n    economic circumstances, possibility of rehabilitation, we do not think\n    that the facts and attaining circumstances of this case are sufficient to\n    place the case in the &#x27;rarest of rare&#x27; category where death penalty should\n    be imposed. We do not think that the reasons assigned by the courts\n    below disclose any special reason to uphold the death penalty and\n    therefore, we decline to confirm the death sentence awarded to the\n    accused Munna @ Shahnawaz. The appellant, therefore, instead of\n    being awarded death penalty, is sentenced to undergo rigorous\n    imprisonment for life.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">    60.   We have carefully considered punishment awarded by the learned\n    trial Court for the offence found proved against the appellants.
