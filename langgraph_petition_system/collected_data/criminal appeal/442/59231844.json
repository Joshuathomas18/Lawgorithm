The Chart found in paragraph No.47(19) was merely setting out the\n\n                various possibilities of progression of the legal proceedings prior to and post\n\n                the Judgment in Ganapathi case. It must be made clear that the Chart was not\n\n                dealing with possibilities that arise after Ganapathi judgment was over ruled.\n\n                The effect of over ruling Ganapathi Judgment is clearly spelt out at paragraph\n\n                No.28 of our Judgment.\n\n\n\n                          3. We were only dealing with the question as to whether an appeal\n\n                would lie before the Sessions Court or before the High Court against a\n\n                Judgment of the Magistrate acquitting the accused person. We have answered\n\n                this question exhaustively and dealt with all the possibilities that falls out of\n\n                our judgment at paragraph No.28.\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n\f                                         4                                 Crl.A. Nos.89 &amp; 90 of 2020 and\n                                                                           Crl.R.C. Nos.494 &amp; 536 of 2019\n                                                                     &amp; Crl.M.P.No.1789, 1794 &amp; 7289 of 2019\n\n\n\n\n                          4. We were not called upon to answer the question as to whether an\n\n                appeal would lie against an Appellate Court Judgment of the Sessions Court\n\n                reversing the Judgment of conviction passed by the Magistrate. The reason is\n\n                not too far to seek since the answer lies in <a href=\"/doc/1856707/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 378(4)</a> of Cr.P.C. As against\n\n                such acquittals, the complainant has the remedy of filing appeal before the\n\n                High Court under <a href=\"/doc/487026/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 378</a> of Cr.P.C. Yet another reasons as to why the\n\n                complainant cannot be directed to file a revision petition is that as a revisional\n\n                Court even if the High Court wants to interfere with the Judgment of the\n\n                Sessions Court and reverse it, acquittal cannot be converted into conviction in\n\n                view of the bar under <a href=\"/doc/1305620/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 401(3)</a> of Cr.P.C.\n\n\n\n                          5. We therefore reiterate and clarify that as against the Judgment of the\n\n                Sessions Court reversing the Judgment of acquittal passed by Magistrate, the\n\n                complainant has been provided with the right of appeal under <a href=\"/doc/487026/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 378</a> of\n\n                Cr.P.C., before the High Court. The Registry must number such petitions only\n\n                as an appeal and not as a revision petition. If the Registry has until now\n\n                numbered such petition as revision petitions, it must be immediately\n\n                renumbered as Criminal Appeals.\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n\f                                    5                             Crl.A.

Sub-Section (4) of Section 378 makes provision for\n                                   appeal against an order of acquittal passed in case\n                                   instituted upon complaint. It states that in such case if\n                                   the complainant makes an application to the High Court\n                                   and the High Court grants special leave to appeal, the\n                                   complainant may present such an appeal to the High\n                                   Court. This sub-section speaks of ‘special leave’ as\n                                   against sub-section (3) relating to other appeals which\n                                   speaks of ‘leave’. Thus, complainant’s appeal against an\n                                   order    of    acquittal     is    a    category   by    itself.    The\n                                   complainant could be a private person or a public\n                                   servant. This is evident from sub-section (5) which refers\n                                   to    application    filed        for   ‘special   leave’     by     the\n                                   complainant. It grants six months period of limitation to\n                                   a complainant who is a public servant and sixty days in\n                                   every other case for filing application. Sub- Section (6) is\n                                   important. It states that if in any case complainant’s\n                                   application for ‘special leave’ under sub-Section (4) is\n                                   refused no appeal from order of acquittal shall lie under\n                                   sub-section (1) or under sub- section (2). Thus, if ‘special\n                                   leave’ is not granted to the complainant to appeal\n                                   against an order of acquittal the matter must end there.\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/   Neither the District Magistrate not the State Government\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\f                                             19                                   Crl.A.

Thus, a Court is\n\n                                   expected to correct the error resulting in a judgment,\n\n                                   which would not have been rendered otherwise.

Before parting with this case, we consider it\n                                   necessary to observe that one of the main reasons for\n                                   over-flowing of court dockets is the frivolous litigation\n                                   in which the Courts are engaged by the litigants and\n                                   which is dragged as long as possible. Even if these\n                                   litigants ultimately loose the lis, they become the real\n                                   victors and have the last laugh.

Nullity is a result of an order or decision\n\n                becoming void. When such a decision lacks inherent jurisdiction, it becomes\n\n                nullity. If a decision is made pursuant to an earlier decision of a higher\n\n                forum, which itself can be termed as per incuriam being ignorant of                     a\n\n                binding precedent, the subsequent decision can be termed as void.\n\n                However, such an order would not become a nullity. This is more so with a\n\n                judicial decision. Thus, such an order though becomes void, for lack of\n\n                jurisdiction, has necessarily to be challenged in the manner known to law.\n\n                Accordingly, such a party aggrieved cannot be permitted to contend that it\n\n                is not bound by an order passed by the judicial forum and                   therefore,\n\n                entitled to treat it as non est.

A party to the lis or a third party, who\n\n                                   considers an order passed by a Court as void or non est,\n\n                                   must approach a Court of competent jurisdiction, to have\n\n                                   the said order set aside, on such grounds as may be\n\n                                   available in law.

In other words, an order passed\n\n                                   by a Court having no jurisdiction, had subsisted for six\n\n                                   years.

If we analyse Section 378(1)(a) &amp; (b), it is clear that the State\n                            Government cannot direct the Public Prosecutor to file an appeal\n                            against an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of\n                            a cognizable and non-bailable offence because of the categorical\n                            bar created by Section 378(1)(b). Such appeals, that is appeals\n                            against orders of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a\n                            cognizable and non-bailable offence can only be filed in the\n                            Sessions Court at the instance of the Public Prosecutor as\n                            directed by the District Magistrate. Section 378(1)(b) uses the\n                            words “in any case” but leaves out orders of acquittal passed by a\n                            Magistrate in respect of a cognizable and non-bailable offence\n                            from the control of the State Government. Therefore, in all other\n                            cases where orders of acquittal are passed appeals can be filed\n                            by the Public Prosecutor as directed by the State Government to\n                            the High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_124\">                            19. Sub-Section (4) of Section 378 makes provision for appeal\n                            against an order of acquittal passed in case instituted upon\n                            complaint. It states that in such case if the complainant makes an\n                            application to the High Court and the High Court grants special\n                            leave to appeal, the complainant may present such an appeal to\n                            the High Court. This sub-section speaks of ‘special leave’ as\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis/\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">\f                                         73                                 Crl.A.

Thus, complainant’s appeal against an order of acquittal\n                            is a category by itself. The complainant could be a private person\n                            or a public servant. This is evident from sub-section (5) which\n                            refers to application filed for ‘special leave’ by the complainant.\n                            It grants six months period of limitation to a complainant who is a\n                            public servant and sixty days in every other case for filing\n                            application. Sub- Section (6) is important. It states that if in any\n                            case complainant’s application for ‘special leave’ under sub-\n                            Section (4) is refused no appeal from order of acquittal shall lie\n                            under sub-section (1) or under sub- section (2). Thus, if ‘special\n                            leave’ is not granted to the complainant to appeal against an\n                            order of acquittal the matter must end there. Neither the District\n                            Magistrate not the State Government can appeal against that\n                            order of acquittal. The idea appears to be to accord quietus to\n                            the case in such a situation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_125\">                            20.

Thus, whether a case is a case instituted on a\n                            complaint depends on the legal provisions relating to the offence\n                            involved therein.

Section\n                            378(4) places no restriction on the complainant.

It introduced Section 378(1)(a) which\n                            permitted the District Magistrate, in any case, to direct the\n                            Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the Court of Session\n                            from an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of a\n                            cognizable and non-bailable offence.

Thus, the State Government cannot present an appeal\n                            against an order of acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of\n                            a cognizable and non-bailable offence. We have already noted\n                            Clause 37 of the 154th Report of the Law Commission of India and\n                            Clause 37 of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_169\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> (Amendment) Bill,\n                            1994 which state that in order to guard against the arbitrary\n                            exercise of power and to reduce reckless acquittals Section 378\n                            was sought to be amended to provide appeal against an order of\n                            acquittal passed by a Magistrate in respect of cognizable and non-\n                            bailable offence. Thus, this step is taken by the legislature to\n                            check arbitrary and reckless acquittals. It appears that being\n                            conscious of rise in unmerited acquittals, in case of certain\n                            acquittals, the legislature has enabled the District Magistrate to\n                            direct the Public Prosecutor to present an appeal to the Sessions\n                            Court, thereby avoiding the tedious and time consuming\n                            procedure of approaching the State with a proposal, getting it\n                            sanctioned and then filing an appeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_128\">                            22.

It was held that once a case is instituted on a\n\n                complaint and an order of acquittal is passed, the complainant can file an\n\n                application under Section 378(4) for Special leave to Appeal in the High\n\n                Court. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court took into consideration the marked\n\n                difference when it comes to such appeal filed by the prosecution, wherein,\n\n                certain checks and balances were introduced to check arbitrary exercise of\n\n                power and to reduce reckless acquittals. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court also\n\n                took into consideration the fact that the amendment made filing of certain\n\n                Appeals by the prosecution against certain types of acquittal orders\n\n                prescribed under Section 378(1) (a) easier, less cumbersome and less time-\n\n                consuming. Ultimately, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court made it very clear in\n\n                Paragraph No.23 of the Judgement that a complainant can file an\n\n                application for Special Leave to Appeal against an order of acquittal of any\n\n                kind only to the High Court.

State of\n\n                Madhya Pradesh and others</a>] reported in 2015 15 SCC 613. It is important\n\n                to note that both these cases arose on a &quot;Police Report&quot; and not on a Private\n\n                Complaint. Therefore, both these judgements, with respect, cannot form\n\n                the basis in a case where the Court was specifically dealing with the right of\n\n                a complainant against an order of acquittal passed in a complaint. After a\n\n                thorough search, we find that there is not a single case where the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n                Supreme Court has equated the right of a complainant to that of a victim, in\n\n                a case of acquittal arising out of a complaint. Even though, both the terms “\n\n                Complainant” and “Victim” can be interchanged while using it as a term Per\n\n                se, the same cannot be done when it comes to dealing with the right of\n\n                filing an Appeal against acquittal.

By reading the\n\n                term “Victim” into the term “Complainant” and attempting to create a right\n\n                to the complainant under proviso to Section 372, will only end up in causing\n\n                violence to the existing frame work of the code of Criminal Procedure.

It is a settled law that where orders / judgements have become\n\n                final between the parties and it has been accepted by the parties and acted\n\n                upon, it should never be allowed to be re-opened. Even if a party considers\n\n                an order or judgement to be void or non-est in law, he has to necessarily\n\n                challenge that order /judgement on that ground. A party can never be\n\n                allowed to disregard an order / judgement passed by a Court. If that is\n\n                allowed, it will result in disastrous consequence.

We endorse the opinion expressed by this\n\n                         Court in the Jehal Tanti case9. In the above case, an earlier\n\n                         order of a Court was found to be without jurisdiction after\n\n                         six years. In other words, an order passed by a Court having\n\n                         no jurisdiction, had subsisted for six years. This Court held,\n\n                         that the said order could not have been violated while it\n\n                         subsisted. And further, that the violation of the order,\n\n                         before it is set aside, is liable to entail punishment, for its\n\n                         disobedience.
