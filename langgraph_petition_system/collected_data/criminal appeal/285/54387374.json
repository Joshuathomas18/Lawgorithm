Pharmaceuticals Ltd.</a>(supra) would be\n\napposite. While dealing with an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 138</a> of the NI\n\nAct, the Court explaining the duty of a Magistrate while issuing\n\nprocess and his power to dismiss a complaint under Section 203\n\nwithout even issuing process observed thus:­\n\n\n\n\n3 2013(16) SCC 630\n4 2015(1) SCC 103\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                                 12</span>\n\f      “5. … a complaint must contain material to enable the Magistrate\n      to make up his mind for issuing process. If this were not the\n      requirement, consequences could be far­reaching. If a Magistrate\n      had to issue process in every case, the burden of work before the\n      Magistrate as well as the harassment caused to the respondents to\n      whom process is issued would be tremendous. Even Section 204 of\n      the Code starts with the words ‘if in the opinion of the Magistrate\n      taking cognizance of an offence there is sufficient ground for\n      proceeding’. The words ‘sufficient ground for proceeding’ again\n      suggest that ground should be made out in the complaint for\n      proceeding against the respondent. It is settled law that at the time\n      of issuing of the process the Magistrate is required to see only the\n      allegations in the complaint and where allegations in the complaint\n      or the charge­sheet do not constitute an offence against a person,\n      the complaint is liable to be dismissed.”</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">21.   After so stating, the Court analysed <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 141</a> of the NI Act\n\nand after referring to certain other authorities answered a reference\n\nwhich reads as follows:­\n\n            19(a) It is necessary to specifically aver in a complaint\n            under <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 141</a> that at the time the offence was\n            committed, the person accused was in charge of, and\n            responsible for the conduct of business of the\n            company. This averment is an essential requirement of\n            <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 141</a> and has to be made in a complaint.\n            Without this averment being made in a complaint, the\n            requirements of <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 141</a> cannot be said to be\n            satisfied.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">            (b) The answer to the question posed in sub­para (b)\n            has to be in the negative. Merely being a director of a\n            company is not sufficient to make the person liable\n            under <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 141</a> of the Act. A director in a company\n            cannot be deemed to be in charge of and responsible\n            to the company for the conduct of its business. The\n            requirement of <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 141</a> is that the person sought\n            to be made liable should be in charge of and\n            responsible for the conduct of the business of the\n            company at the relevant time. This has to be averred\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                              13</span>\n\f            as a fact as there is no deemed liability of a director in\n            such cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">            (c) The answer to Question (c) has to be in the\n            affirmative. The question notes that the managing\n            director or joint managing director would be\n            admittedly in charge of the company and responsible\n            to the company for the conduct of its business. When\n            that is so, holders of such positions in a company\n            become liable under <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 141</a> of the Act. By virtue\n            of the office they hold as managing director or joint\n            managing director, these persons are in charge of and\n            responsible for the conduct of business of the\n            company. Therefore, they get covered under Section\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">            141. So far as the signatory of a cheque which is\n            dishonoured is concerned, he is clearly responsible for\n            the incriminating act and will be covered under sub­\n            section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 141</a>.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"127459994\" id=\"span_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117856174\" id=\"span_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1488243\" id=\"span_27\">22.

Despite\n\nthe presence of basic averment, it may come to a conclusion that no\n\ncase is made out against the particular Director for which there\n\ncould be various reasons.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_59\">24.   The issue for determination before us is whether the role of the\n\nappellants in the capacity of the Director of the defaulter company\n\nmakes them vicariously liable for the activities of the defaulter\n\nCompany as defined under <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 141</a> of the NI Act?              In that\n\nperception, whether the appellant had committed the offence\n\nchargeable under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 138</a> of the NI Act?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                                      15</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">\f25.   We are concerned in this case with Directors who are not\n\nsignatories to the cheques.   So far as Directors who are not the\n\nsignatories to the cheques or who are not Managing Directors or\n\nJoint Managing Directors are concerned, it is clear from the\n\nconclusions drawn in the afore­stated judgment that it is necessary\n\nto aver in the complaint filed under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 138</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_33\">Section\n\n141</a> of the NI Act that at the relevant time when the offence was\n\ncommitted, the Directors were in charge of and were responsible for\n\nthe conduct of the business of the company.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1302578\" id=\"span_31\">26.   This averment assumes importance because it is the basic and\n\nessential averment which persuades the Magistrate to issue process\n\nagainst the Director.      That is why    this Court in     <a href=\"/doc/1302578/\" id=\"a_34\">S.M.S.\n\nPharmaceuticals     Ltd.</a>(supra) observed that the question of\n\nrequirement of averments in a complaint has to be considered on\n\nthe basis of provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_35\">Sections 138</a> and <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_36\">141</a> of the NI\n\nAct read in the light of the powers of a Magistrate referred to in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/444619/\" id=\"a_37\">Sections 200</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1827798/\" id=\"a_38\">204</a> CrPC which recognise the Magistrate’s\n\ndiscretion to take action in accordance with law.      Thus, it is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                                                 16</span>\n\fimperative that if this basic averment is missing, the Magistrate is\n\nlegally justified in not issuing process.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_63\">27.   In the case on hand, reading the complaint as a whole, it is\n\nclear that the allegations in the complaint are that at the time at\n\nwhich the cheques were issued by the Company and dishonoured\n\nby the Bank, the appellants were the Directors of the Company and\n\nwere responsible for its business and all the appellants were\n\ninvolved in the business of the Company and were responsible for\n\nall the affairs of the Company. It may not be proper to split while\n\nreading the complaint so as to come to a conclusion that the\n\nallegations as a whole are not sufficient to fulfil the requirement of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 141</a> of the NI Act. The complaint specifically refers to the\n\npoint of time when the cheques were issued, their presentment,\n\ndishonour and failure to pay in spite of notice of dishonour. In the\n\ngiven circumstances, we have no hesitation in overruling the\n\nargument made by the learned counsel for the appellants.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_64\">28.   Indisputedly,   on   the   presentation   of   the   cheque   of\n\nRs.10,00,000/­(Rupees Ten Lakhs only) dated 2 nd June 2012, the\n\ncheque was dishonoured due to “funds insufficient” in the account\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                                    17</span>\n\fand after making due compliance, complaint was filed and after\n\nrecording the statement of the complainant, proceedings were\n\ninitiated by the learned Magistrate and no error has been\n\ncommitted by the High Court in dismissing the petition filed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 482</a> CrPC under the impugned judgment.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_65\">29.   The submission of learned counsel for the appellants that they\n\nare the non­executive Directors in the light of the documentary\n\nevidence placed on record by Form No. 32 issued by the Registrar of\n\nCompanies, both the appellants are shown to be the Directors of the\n\nCompany, still open for the appellants to justify during course of\n\nthe trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">30.   In our considered view, the High Court has rightly not\n\ninterfered in exercise of its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 482</a> CrPC for\n\nquashing of the complaint.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">31.   Before concluding, we would like to observe that the\n\nproceedings could not be processed further in view of the interim\n\norder passed by this Court dated 17 th October 2014 and because of\n\nthe instant appeals, the other cases instituted by the respondent(s)­\n\ncomplainant have been held up before the trial Court.
