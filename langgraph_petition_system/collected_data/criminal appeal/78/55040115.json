The allegations in the complaint are\n\nthat marriage was solemnised on 15.04.2012 in which\n\nmarriage, gifts of Rs.50 lakhs were given to Nayan\n\nChopra and his family members.                   It is alleged that\n\nafter    the   marriage,     all        family    members   were     not\n\nsatisfied by the gifts and they started harassing the\n\ndaughter of respondent No.2 by demanding further dowry\n\nof one crore rupees.              They further pressurised to\n\nsolemnise the marriage of Vanshika as per Punjabi rites\n\nand     ceremonies,   on    which        pressure,     marriage      was\n\nsolemnised on 06.11.2012 in Gurudwara at Sector 37,\n\nNoida as per Punjabi rites and ceremonies.                    Further\n\nallegations are that family members of Nayan Chopra\n\nkept on threatening Vanshika to desert her and on\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                   11</span>\n\f01.12.2013 Nayan Chopra threw Vanshika out of house and\n\nsince then Vanshika is residing with respondent No.2.\n\nAnother set of allegations are with regard to incident\n\ndated 08.11.2014 alleged to have been taken place at\n\n6.00 PM near the Gurudwara, Sector-18, Noida.     It is\n\nalleged that Rajesh Chopra, father of Nayan Chopra\n\ncalled the respondent No.2 to talk about their problem\n\non which date Rajesh Chopra again repeated his demand\n\nof one crore rupees and used filthy words against\n\nVanshika to which respondent No.2 objected, on which\n\nRajesh Chopra and his associates became annoyed and\n\nthey abused and beat the respondent No.2 and snatched\n\nhis gold chain from his neck and Rs.60,000/- from his\n\npocket.

The ends of\n   justice are higher than the ends of\n   mere law though justice has got to be\n   administered according to laws made by\n   the   legislature.    The   compelling\n   necessity     for     making     these\n   observations is that without a proper\n   realisation of the object and purpose\n   of the provision which seeks to save\n   the inherent powers of the High Court\n   to do justice, between the State and\n   its subjects, it would be impossible\n   to appreciate the width and contours\n   of that salient jurisdiction.”\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                     21</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">\f<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1033637\" id=\"span_34\">24.

Few facts have to be noticed before we look into\n\nthe allegations made in the complaint in the above\n\nregard.   The complaint has been filed by the respondent\n\nNo.2   before   the   C.J.M.,    Gautam   Budh   Nagar   on\n\n10.05.2015, before which date, the petition for divorce\n\nhas already been filed by Nayan Chopra on 23.10.2014\n\nbefore the Circuit Court for the County of Kalamazoo\n\nFamily Division, Michigan.       It is on the record that\n\nat the time of filing of the complaint Vanishka Bobal\n\nwas living at Canada whereas Nayan Chopra was living\n\nat U.S.A.   Both were separately living.    It was pleaded\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                            26</span>\n\fin the application for divorce that husband and wife\n\nhad separated on or around November, 2013.     It is on\n\nthe record that on the day criminal complaint was filed\n\non 10.05.2015 in the Court of C.J.M. Gautam Budh Nagar\n\nby respondent No.2, neither Vanishka was in India nor\n\nshe was in India at the time when statements were\n\nrecorded in complaint of complainant as well as his two\n\nwitnesses.   The complaint is not by Vanishka but it has\n\nbeen filed by father of Vanishka, respondent No.2.    In\n\nthe divorce application filed in the State of Michigan,\n\nVanishka Bobal was represented by her attorney.      The\n\ndivorce was granted with orders relating to alimony,\n\npension   benefits   and   retirement   benefits,   life\n\ninsurance, property settlement and provision in lieu\n\nof dower, mutual release of claims and other aspects\n\non 24.02.2016.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">23. There is nothing on the record to indicate that\n\norders of divorce between the parties was brought into\n\nthe notice of the Magistrate when he issued process\n\nagainst the appellants.    We, however, are in agreement\n\nwith the submission of Shri Santosh Krishan that decree\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                            27</span>\n\fof divorce between Nayan Chopra and Vanshika shall not\n\nwipe out any criminal offence, which has been committed\n\nwithin the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_85\">I.P.C</a>. or <a href=\"/doc/1763444/\" id=\"a_86\">D.P.

Coming back to the allegations in the complaint\n\npertaining to Section 498A and <a href=\"/doc/751411/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 3</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1023340/\" id=\"a_88\">4</a> of D.P.

No specific incident dates or details\n\nof any incident has been mentioned in the complaint.\n\nThe complaint having been filed after proceeding for\n\ndivorce was initiated by Nayan Chopra in State of\n\nMichigan, where Vanshika participated and divorce was\n\nultimately granted. A      few months after filing of the\n\ndivorce petition, the complaint has been filed in the\n\nCourt of C.J.M., Gautam Budh Nagar with the allegations\n\nas noticed above.

One observation also needs to be made with regard\n\nto order passed by the High Court.        High Court in its\n\nimpugned judgment has not referred to allegations made\n\nin the complaint except noticing the summoning order\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                             33</span>\n\fhas been passed and noticing the principles of law.\n\nThis Court had occasion to consider a similar order\n\npassed by the High Court rejecting the application\n\nunder Section 482 Cr.P.C. in Jagdish Prasad and Others\n\nVs. State of Uttar Pradesh and Another, (2019) 2 SCC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">184.     In the said case also under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_97\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C.\n\nproceedings, the challenge was made to summoning order\n\nas well as entire proceedings of complaint case where\n\nallegations under <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_98\">Sections 498A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_99\">323</a> IPC as well as\n\n<a href=\"/doc/751411/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 3</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1023340/\" id=\"a_101\">4</a> of D.P.

In paragraph No.3,\n\nthe facts giving rise to filing the application under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 482</a> Cr.P.C. before the High Court has been\n\nnoted.      This   Court made    following observations in\n\nparagraph Nos.6 to 9:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">       “6. Having heard the learned counsel for the\n       parties and on perusal of the record of the\n       case we are inclined to set aside the\n       impugned order and remand the case to the\n       High Court for deciding the appellants’\n       application, out of which this appeal arises,\n       afresh on merits in accordance with law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">       7. On perusal of the impugned order, we find\n       that the Single Judge has quoted the\n       principles of law <a href=\"/doc/1033637/\" id=\"a_103\">laid down by</a> this Court in\n       several decisions relating to powers of the\n       High Court on the issue of interference in\n       cases filed under Section 482 of the Code\n       from para 2 to the concluding para but has\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                34</span>\n\f     not referred to the facts of the case to\n     appreciate the controversy of the case. We\n     are, therefore, unable to know the factual\n     matrix of the case after reading the impugned\n     judgment except the legal principles <a href=\"/doc/1033637/\" id=\"a_104\">laid\n     down by</a> this Court in several decisions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">     8. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1033637\" id=\"span_53\">In our view, the Single Judge ought to\n     have first set out the brief facts of the\n     case with a view to understand the factual\n     matrix and then examined the challenge made\n     to the proceedings in the light of the\n     principles of law <a href=\"/doc/1033637/\" id=\"a_105\">laid down by</a> this Court\n     with a view to record the findings on the\n     grounds urged by the appellants as to whether\n     any interference therein is called for or\n     not. We find that the aforementioned exercise\n     was not done by the High Court while passing\n     the impugned order.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">     9. We, therefore, find ourselves unable to\n     concur with such disposal of the application\n     by the High Court and feel inclined to set\n     aside the impugned order and remand the case\n     to the High Court (Single Judge) with a\n     request to decide the application afresh on\n     merits in accordance with law keeping in view\n     the   aforementioned   observations.   Having\n     formed an opinion to remand the case in the\n     light of our reasoning mentioned above, we\n     do not consider it proper to go into the\n     merits of the case.”\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">28. What was said by this Court in paragraph No. 7 and\n\n8 of the above judgment is squarely applicable in the\n\nfacts of the present case and the order of the High\n\nCourt deserves to be set aside on this ground alone.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                          35</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">\f29. One of the submissions, which has been made by the\n\nlearned counsel for the appellant also needs to be\n\nconsidered.     Learned counsel for the appellant had\n\nsubmitted    that    complaint    has   not    been   filed   by   a\n\ncompetent person.       It is submitted that complaint is\n\nnot made by Vanshika, but has been filed only by father\n\nof Vanshika, hence it is not maintainable. The above\n\nsubmission has been refuted by Shri Santosh Krishnan.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_58\">He submits that it is not necessary that a complaint\n\nunder Section 498A should be filed only by the victim\n\nof offence.    He submits that complaint filed by father\n\nof   the    victim,    respondent       No.2   was    also    fully\n\nmaintainable.       Section 498A provides as follows:-\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">     “498A. Husband or relative of husband of a\n     woman subjecting her to cruelty.— Whoever,\n     being the husband or the relative of the\n     husband of a woman, subjects such woman to\n     cruelty shall be punished with imprisonment\n     for a term which may extend to three years\n     and shall also be liable to fine.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">     Explanation.—For the purpose of this section,\n     “cruelty” means—\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">       (a)    any wilful conduct which is of such\n              a nature as is likely to drive the\n              woman to commit suicide or to cause\n              grave injury or danger to life,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                 36</span>\n\f              limb or health (whether mental or\n              physical) of the woman; or\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">       (b)    harassment of the woman where such\n              harassment is with a view to\n              coercing her or any person related\n              to her to meet any unlawful demand\n              for any property or valuable\n              security or is on account of\n              failure by her or any person\n              related to her to meet such\n              demand.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">30. Section 498A provides for an offence when husband\n\nor the relative of the husband, subject her to cruelty.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_59\">There is nothing in Section 498A, which may indicate\n\nthat when a woman is subjected to cruelty, a complaint\n\nhas to be filed necessarily by the women so subjected.\n\nA   perusal   of   Section   498A,   as   extracted   above,\n\nindicates that the provision does not contemplate that\n\ncomplaint for offence under Section 498A should be\n\nfiled only by women, who is subjected to cruelty by\n\nhusband or his relative.      We, thus, are of the view\n\nthat complaint filed by respondent No.2, the father of\n\nVanshika cannot be said to be not maintainable on this\n\nground.   We, thus, reject the submission of the counsel\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                             37</span>\n\ffor the appellant that complaint filed by respondent\n\nNo.2 was not maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">31. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1033637\" id=\"span_57\">In view of the foregoing discussions, insofar as\n\nthe offence under Section 498A and <a href=\"/doc/751411/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 3</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1023340/\" id=\"a_107\">4</a> of D.P.\n\nAct is concerned, we are of the view that present is a\n\ncase, which is covered by Category 7 as enumerated by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1033637/\" id=\"a_108\">State of Haryana Vs.
