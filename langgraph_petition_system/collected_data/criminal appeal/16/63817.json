The appellant was convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 302</a> of the IPC\n\n     for having murdered his wife, four minor daughters and a\n\n     minor son all between 1 and 16 years of age and was\n\n     sentenced to death by the Additional Sessions Judge,\n\n     Manasa by judgment dated 24th April, 2006.            On an\n\n     appeal and reference to the High Court, the conviction\n\n     and sentence has been maintained leading to the present\n\n     appeal. The prosecution story is as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\f                                Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                   No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                  2</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">2.   At about mid night of the 19th August, 2005 PW1\n\n     Ramprasad, the brother of the appellant, on being\n\n     informed by PW-4 Balchand that he had heard a huge\n\n     commotion from the appellant&#x27;s house, rushed that side\n\n     and looking through the window saw the appellant sitting\n\n     in the room with a bloodstained knife in his hand and his\n\n     clothes soiled in blood and the dead bodies of his wife\n\n     Amribai, and daughters Karibai, Vidhyabai, Rajubai and\n\n     Rachna aged 16 years, 12 years, 8 years and 6 years\n\n     respectively and his son Dilkhush aged 1 year lying\n\n     besides him. Ramprasad asked the appellant as to what\n\n     he      had   done   but   he   threatened   him   with   dire\n\n     consequences and told him that he would kill him as\n\n     well.     Ramprasad thereupon retreated and raised an\n\n     alarm which attracted the occupants of the neighbouring\n\n     houses, and also locked the room from the outside to\n\n     prevent the appellant&#x27;s escape. He also rushed to Police\n\n     Station, Manasa accompanied by Sarpanch Devilal (PW3)\n\n     and recorded the F.I.R.. He then returned to the village\n\n     with a police party, headed by PW15 SI Karulal Patel.\n\f                              Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                 No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                3</span>\nThe     appellant   was    arrested     on    the   spot     and   on\n\ninterrogation a bloodstained pajama and knife hidden in\n\na   quilt   were    seized.      On    the    completion      of   the\n\ninvestigation, he was brought to trial on six counts of\n\nmurders. He pleaded innocence and claimed trial. The\n\ntrial   court   observed       that   the    case   rested    almost\n\nexclusively on circumstantial evidence and then went on\n\nto examine the various circumstances. The court found\n\nthat the evidence of PW1 Ramprasad that the dead\n\nbodies were lying in the room was supported by the\n\nevidence of PW3 Devilal, PW11 Vinod as also PW15 SI\n\nKarulal.     The court also observed that the medical\n\nevidence of PW-8 Dr. R.K. Joshi and PW-9 Dr. Dinesh\n\nBansal, who, between themselves, had carried out the\n\npost-mortem examinations on the dead bodies to the\n\neffect that the murders had been committed with a knife\n\nand that the knife which had been recovered at the\n\ninstance of the appellant from inside the room could be\n\nthe murder weapon, corroborated the ocular account.\n\nThe court further held that though in a case of\n\f                           Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                              No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                             4</span>\ncircumstantial evidence motive was of great significance,\n\nit could not be said as a matter of principle that the\n\nabsence of motive would render the prosecution story\n\nweak and in the light of the fact that the murders had\n\nbeen committed in the family home which was locked\n\nfrom the inside, with no other person present at that\n\ntime, it was to some extent obligatory on the appellant to\n\nhave given some explanation as to the murders.                 The\n\ncourt   then    observed    that    the    explanation    in   the\n\nstatement      under   <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_2\">Section     313</a>    of   the   Cr.P.C.   was\n\nunacceptable as it had been simply pleaded that he had\n\nbeen sleeping in the room and had woken up on hearing\n\na noise outside and the police had entered the room and\n\ncaught hold of him and had immediately arrested him.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1896096\" id=\"span_7\">The appellant also undertook to produce evidence in\n\ndefence, but ultimately did not do so.                PW-1 Ram\n\nPrasad&#x27;s statement at the trial that some thief had been\n\npresent in the room on the date and time in question was\n\nrejected, as being an after thought as he was the\n\nappellant&#x27;s brother, and was making a belated attempt to\n\f                       Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                          No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                         5</span>\nsave him. The court finally found that the extra judicial\n\nconfession made before Ramprasad PW1 and Devilal PW3\n\nand the fact that he had been arrested from the spot,\n\nclearly proved his involvement.          On a cumulative\n\nassessment of the circumstances, the Court concluded\n\nthat the appellant was involved in the multiple murders.\n\nThe question as to the sentence to be imposed was then\n\nexamined in depth and relying on various judgments of\n\nthis Court and in particular on <a href=\"/doc/1896096/\" id=\"a_3\">Mohan Singh vs. State of\n\nDelhi</a> AIR 1977 SC 949, Rajendra Prasad vs. State of\n\nUttar Pradesh AIR 1979 SC 916, Bachan Singh vs. State\n\nof Punjab AIR 1980 SC 898,           Mahesh &amp; Ors.

A\n\nReference was thereafter made by the Sessions Judge to\n\nthe High Court as postulated by <a href=\"/doc/1146308/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 366</a> of the\n\nCr.P.C. and the accused too challenged the judgment in\n\nappeal.   The High Court first examined the appeal and\n\nconcluded that the evidence against the appellant was\n\nconclusive as to his involvement and though there was\n\nno apparent motive, the other circumstances were\n\nsufficient to bring home the charge.</span>     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"459448\" id=\"span_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"622480\" id=\"span_14\">The merits of the\n\nmurder reference were then examined and after days\n\nconsideration it was held that the matter fell within the\n\ncategory of the rarest of rare cases and relying on the\n\njudgments of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/622480/\" id=\"a_6\">Ravji vs. State of Rajasthan</a>\n\n1996(2) SCC 175, Umashankar Panda vs. State of M.P.\n\n1996 (8) SCC 110, Dayanidhi Bisoi vs. State of Orissa JT\n\n2003 (5) SC 590, State of Rajasthan vs. Kheraj Ram     JT\n\n2003(7) SC 419, Sushil Mumu vs. State of Jharkhand JT\n\f                             Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                               7</span>\n     2003(<a href=\"/doc/459448/\" id=\"a_7\">10) SC 340, and Union of India &amp; Ors.

The High Court, accordingly, dismissed\n\n     the appeal and confirmed the Reference. The matter is\n\n     before us by way of special leave in this backdrop.</span></span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.   This Special Leave Petition first came up before this\n\n     Court on the 1st September, 2006 and was adjourned to\n\n     call for the records. On 25th September, 2006, when the\n\n     case was again taken up, it appears that an argument\n\n     was raised that the appellant had been suffering from\n\n     some mental ailment at the time of the murders and the\n\n     counsel sought time to go through some documents\n\n     pertaining to his treatment. On 8th January, 2007, this\n\n     Court made an order that the counsel should find out, if\n\n     possible, the date and place where the petitioner may\n\n     have been treated. On 12th February, 2007, the counsel\n\n     made a statement that the appellant&#x27;s family members\n\f                       Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                          No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                         8</span>\nhad been able to collect some documents which would be\n\nreceived by him shortly. On 12th March, 2007 leave was\n\ngranted, limited however, to the question of sentence\n\nonly.   During the pendency of this appeal, and on the\n\ndirection of this Court, yet another enquiry was made to\n\nfind out if the appellant had any mental disorder and had\n\nbeen    undergoing   any   treatment     to   this   effect.\n\nConsequent to the enquiry, a report has been tendered to\n\nthis Court supported by an affidavit of Shri Vineet\n\nKumar, Additional Superintendent of Police, District\n\nNeemuch, Madhya Pradesh to the effect that no medical\n\nrecord which could establish that the appellant had\n\nundergone treatment for a mental or psychological\n\nproblem had been found but statements of his family\n\nmembers and others including Mohan Lal, his elder\n\nbrother and his parents Mohan Lal and Sita Devi and the\n\nSecretary of the Gram Panchayat, Achalpur which were\n\nto the effect that the appellant had been addicted to\n\ndrugs, particularly to Ganja, and had become mentally\n\ndisturbed and had been under treatment, and it was on\n\f                            Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                               No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                              9</span>\n     account of this mental illness that he had killed his\n\n     family, had been received, were being put on record.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1684481\" id=\"span_21\">4.   Relying on these statements, the learned counsel for the\n\n     appellant has pointed out that as the appellant appeared\n\n     to be of unsound mind and incapable of understanding\n\n     the nature of his actions he was absolved of any liability\n\n     under <a href=\"/doc/1433889/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 84</a> of the IPC.     On merits, it has been\n\n     urged that in the light of the fact that there was no eye\n\n     witness to the incident, the mere circumstance that the\n\n     murders    had   happened   in   the   family   home,   was\n\n     insufficient to prove the case beyond reasonable doubt,\n\n     and reliance has finally been placed on <a href=\"/doc/1684481/\" id=\"a_9\">Nathu Ram</a>&#x27;s case\n\n     (supra) to contend that a sentence of death based on\n\n     circumstantial evidence was a risky proposition, and was\n\n     thus not called for.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">5.   We have heard the learned counsel for the parties and\n\n     gone through the record very carefully.          The sheer\n\n     enormity of the crime, the diabolical manner of the\n\f                            Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                               No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                              10</span>\n     murders, and the feeling of abhorrence which would\n\n     undoubtedly be raised in the mind of the court, are\n\n     factors which have persuaded us to examine the entire\n\n     story with even greater care and notwithstanding that a\n\n     notice limited to the question of sentence only had been\n\n     issued, we have, in the backdrop of the new issue that\n\n     has been raised, and the horrific consequences for the\n\n     appellant, permitted his counsel to argue the entire\n\n     appeal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">6.   We first examine the argument of the appellant&#x27;s counsel\n\n     based on <a href=\"/doc/1433889/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 84</a> of the I.P.C.. <a href=\"/doc/1433889/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 84</a> reads as\n\n     under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">          &quot;Act of a person of unsound mind. - Nothing is an\n          offence which is done by a person who, at the time\n          of doing it, by reason of unsoundness of mind, is\n          incapable of knowing the nature of the act, or that\n          he is doing what is either wrong or contrary to law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">7.   The benefit of this provision is available to a person who\n\n     at the time when the act was done was incapable of\n\n     knowing the nature of his act or that what he was doing\n\f                        Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                           No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                          11</span>\nwas wrong or contrary to law.     The implication of this\n\nprovision is that the offender must be of this mental\n\ncondition at the time when the act was committed and\n\nthe fact that he was of unsound mind earlier or later are\n\nrelevant only to the extent that they, alongwith other\n\nevidence, may be circumstances in determining the\n\nmental condition of an accused on the day of incident.\n\nWe have gone through the status report filed by Shri\n\nV.K.Jain, Additional S.P. and find it based exclusively on\n\nthe statements made by close family members of the\n\nappellant. It is significant that before the trial court as\n\nwell as in appeal in the High Court, no plea with regard\n\nto the appellant&#x27;s mental condition had been taken and it\n\nwas only in this Court at the SLP stage when, shaken by\n\nthe sheer brutality of the crime, this Court perhaps felt\n\nthat only a person of unsound mind could commit such a\n\nhorrendous crime, and it had thus been thought prudent\n\nto have the matter re-examined. We are of the opinion\n\nhowever, that the statements in the status report and the\n\naffidavit do not advance the appellant&#x27;s case whatsoever.\n\f                               Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                  No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                 12</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">8.   We find that the case against the appellant has been\n\n     proved by the evidence of PW1 Ramprasad, his brother,\n\n     PW3 Devilal and PW11 Vinod his neighbours, who had all\n\n     seen the dead bodies with the appellant sitting beside\n\n     them armed with a knife and he had in fact threatened\n\n     that anyone else interfering would meet the same fate. It\n\n     is also significant that Ramprasad had locked the door\n\n     from the outside and it was in that condition that the\n\n     appellant had been arrested by SI Karulal and his\n\n     bloodstained clothes and knife had been recovered. It is\n\n     true that in a case of circumstantial evidence motive does\n\n     have extreme significance but to say that in the absence\n\n     of   motive,   the   conviction    based    on   circumstantial\n\n     evidence cannot, in principle, be made is not correct. It\n\n     bears repetition that the appellant and the deceased\n\n     family members were the only occupants of the room and\n\n     it was therefore incumbent on the appellant to have\n\n     tendered some explanation in order to avoid any\n\n     suspicion as to his guilt.        The story that a thief was\n\f                        Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                           No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                          13</span>\npresent in the room introduced by Ramprasad at the\n\nstage of the trial was doubtless an attempt to help the\n\nappellant who was his brother.      The medical evidence\n\nalso supports the prosecution story in its entirety. The\n\ntwo doctors, R.K.Joshi and Dinesh Bansal who had\n\nconducted the post-mortem examination on the dead\n\nbodies, concluded that the knife recovered at the\n\ninstance of the appellant could have been used to commit\n\nthe murders.      There is another extremely relevant\n\ncircumstance     pointing     towards     the   appellant&#x27;s\n\ninvolvement. The appellant, after arrest, was found with\n\ninjuries on his person and was subjected to a medical\n\nexamination by PW5 Dr. K.C.Kothari. The doctor reported\n\nsix superficial incised injuries on his person, some on the\n\nneck and the others on the fingers, and opined that they\n\ncould all be self suffered.   This statement was further\n\ncorroborated by the unrebutted testimony of PW3 Devi\n\nLal who testified that the appellant had told him that\n\nafter killing his family he had attempted to commit\n\nsuicide. All the factors <a href=\"/doc/1684481/\" id=\"a_12\">referred to above</a> are undoubtedly\n\f                               Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                  No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                 14</span>\n     circumstances, but they are so evidently categoric, that\n\n     they constitute a chain even stronger than an eye-\n\n     witness account, and do remind us of the clichi that men\n\n     often lie, circumstances do not. We are, therefore, of the\n\n     opinion that the conviction of the appellant on the charge\n\n     of multiple murders is fully justified.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"622480\" id=\"span_32\">9.   The crucial question, and the question on which the\n\n     learned counsel for the appellant has argued with some\n\n     emphasis, is the question of sentence.            It has been\n\n     submitted    that   the   death   sentence   in    a   case   of\n\n     circumstantial evidence was not called for and as there\n\n     appeared to be some evidence that the appellant was of\n\n     unsound mind and the sheer enormity and senselessness\n\n     of the killings also pointed in that direction, and also\n\n     indicated that something unusual had happened on that\n\n     day were all factors which required consideration.            He\n\n     has also submitted that as the murders had been\n\n     committed in the year 2006 and as the death sentence\n\n     had been hanging over the appellant&#x27;s head for more\n\f                        Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                           No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                          15</span>\nthan three years was itself a punishment, the death\n\nsentence ought to be commuted to life.      He has also\n\nreferred us to some of the judgments abovementioned.\n\nThe learned State counsel has submitted with equal\n\nemphasis that the enormity of the crime, the brutality\n\nwith which had been executed, the helpless state of the\n\nvictims vis-`-vis the assailant who was a husband and\n\nfather were all factors which brought the matter within\n\nthe category of the rarest of the rare cases.

As pointed out\n               earlier, both the Sessions Judge and the\n               High Court have given special reasons for\n               awarding death sentence and we are also\n               of the opinion that the crime indulged by\n               the accused is undoubtedly gruesome,\n               cold-blooded, heinous, atrocious and\n               cruel. We are also satisfied that on the\n               facts established on the record, there\n               appears      to     be    no     mitigating\n               circumstances whatsoever, but only\n               aggravating circumstances which justify\n               the imposition of death sentence.

In this particular\n   case, as pointed out above, the appellant was\n   committed to trial by the Presidency Magistrate\n   as early as July 31, 1963, and he was convicted\n   by the Trial Judge on September 4, 1964. It is\n   now January 1971, and the appellant has been\n   for more than six years under the fear of\n   sentence of death. This must have caused him\n   unimaginable mental agony. In our opinion, it\n   would be inhuman to make him suffer till the\n   Government decides the matter on a mercy\n   petition. We consider that this now a fit case for\n   awarding the sentence of imprisonment for life.\n   Accordingly, we accept the appeal, set aside the\n   order of the High Court awarding death\n   sentence and award a sentence of imprisonment\n   for life.

The occurrence took place\n          sometime in December 1972, and more\n          than eight years have elapsed since. The\n          accused had been convicted by the\n          Sessions Court but acquitted by the High\n          Court. The present appeal has been\n          pending for five years. Having regard to the\n          reasons given above, therefore, we feel that\n          although the murders committed by Sahai\n          were extremely gruesome, brutal and\n          dastardly, yet the extreme penalty of death\n          is not called for in the circumstances of this\n          particular case.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1166797\" id=\"span_60\">It is true that in some of the cases <a href=\"/doc/974810/\" id=\"a_32\">referred to above</a>, a\n\ndelay beyond two or three years has been said to be excessive\n\nbut in <a href=\"/doc/1166797/\" id=\"a_33\">Sher Singh vs. State of Punjab</a> (1983) 2 SCC 344, this\n\f                               Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                  No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                 23</span>\nCourt while agreeing with the broad proposition with regard to\n\nthe delay in death penalty cases, declined to accept the outer\n\ntime limit of two years for the execution of a death sentence,\n\nfailing which it would be incumbent on the court to commute\n\nit to life but at the same time had some very pertinent\n\nobservations to make.       We reproduce some of them herein\n\nbelow:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">         &quot;But we must hasten to add that this Court\n         has not taken the narrow view that the\n         jurisdiction to interfere with a death sentence\n         can be exercised only in an appeal against the\n         judgment of conviction and sentence. The\n         question which arises in such appeals is\n         whether the extreme penalty provided by law is\n         called for in the circumstances of the case. The\n         question which arises in proceedings such as\n         those before us is whether, even if the death\n         sentence was the only appropriate sentence to\n         impose in the case and was therefore imposed.\n         It will be harsh and unjust to execute that\n         sentence by reason of supervening events. In\n         very recent times, the sentence of death has\n         been commuted to life imprisonment by this\n         Court in quite a few cases for the reason, inter\n         alia, that the prisoner was under the spectre of\n         the sentence of death for an unduly long time\n         after the final confirmation of that sentence,\n         consequence upon the dismissal of the\n         prisoner&#x27;s special leave petition or appeal by\n         this Court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">and further\n\f                             Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                               24</span>\n           &quot;The prolonged anguish of alternating\n      hope and despair, the agony of uncertainty,\n      the consequences of such suffering on the\n      mental, emotional, and physical integrity and\n      health of the individual can render the\n      decision to execute the sentence of death an\n      inhuman and degrading punishment in the\n      circumstances of a given case.&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">            &quot;Death sentence is constitutionally valid\n      and permissible within the constraints of the\n      rule in Bachan Singh.

The\n      death row inmate must contend with a\n      segregated environment marked by immobility,\n      reduced stimulation, and the prospect of\n      harassment by staff. There is also the risk that\n      visits from loved ones will become increasingly\n      rate, for the man who is &quot;civilly dead&quot; is often\n\f                             Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                               25</span>\n      abandoned by the living. The condemned\n      prisoner&#x27;s ordeal is usually a lonely one and\n      must be met largely through his own\n      resources. The uncertainties of his case -\n      pending appeals, unanswered bids for\n      commutation, possible changes in the law -\n      may aggravate adjustment problems. A\n      continuing and pressing concern is whether\n      one will join the substantial minority who\n      obtain a reprieve or will be counted among the\n      to-be-dead. Uncertainty may make the\n      dilemma of the death row inmate             more\n      complicated than simply choosing between\n      maintaining hope or surrendering to despair.\n      The condemned can afford neither alternative,\n      but must nurture both a desire to life and an\n      acceptance of imminent death. As revealed in\n      the suffering of terminally ill patients, this is\n      an extremely difficult task, one in which\n      resources afforded by family or those within\n      the institutional context may prove critical to\n      the persons&#x27;s adjustment. The death row\n      inmate must achieve equilibrium with few\n      coping supports. In the process, he must\n      somehow maintain his dignity and integrity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">           Death row is a prison within a prison,\n      physically and socially isolated from the prison\n      community and the outside world.

That is the true implication of\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and to that\nextent, we express our broad and respectful\nagreement with our learned Brethren in their\nvisualisation of the meaning of that Article.\nThe horizons of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 21</a> are ever widening\nand the final word on its conspectus shall\nnever have been said. So long as life lasts, so\nlong shall it be the duty and endeavour of this\nCourt to give to the provisions of our\nConstitution a meaning which will prevent\nhuman suffering and degradation. Therefore,\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 21</a> is as much relevant at the stage of\nexecution of the death sentence as it is in the\ninterregnum between the imposition of that\nsentence and its execution. The essence of the\nmatter is that all procedure, no matter what\nthe stage, must be fair, just and reasonable.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">        The judgments rendered aforesaid have\nthrown model underlying philosophy of the\naforesaid judgments has already indicated\nabove stem out not only from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 21</a> of the\nConstitution but from the judgments rendered\nby the 8th Amendment in the US Constitution\nratifying way back in 1791 which provide that\nno cruel and unusual punishment shall be\ninflicted. While construing this provision, the\nCourt of the Magistrates while observing that\nthe Eight Amendment does not prohibit capital\npunishment did indicate that as pending\nexecution had it dehumanizing effect and\nlengthy imprisonment prior to execution and\nthe judicial and administrative procedures\nessential to the due process of law are carried\n\f                      Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                         No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                        27</span>\nout. Penologists and medical experts agreed\nthat the process of carrying out a verdict of\ndeath is often so degrading and brutalizing to\nthe human spirit as to constitute psychological\ntorture. Relying on Coleman vs. Balkcom, 451\nU.S. 949, 952 (1981) observed that &quot;the\ndeterrent value of incarceration during that\nperiod of uncertainty may well be comparable\nto the consequences of the ultimate step itself&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">and when the death penalty &quot;ceases\nrealistically to further these purposes,.....its\nimposition would then be the pointless and\nneedless extinction of life with only marginal\ncontributions to any discernible social or\npublic purposes.         A penalty with such\nnegligible returns to the State would be\npatently excessive and cruel and unusual\npunishment       violative  of    the   Eighth\nAmendment.&quot;        The Courts have, however,\ndrawn a distinction whereby the accused\nhimself has been responsible for the delay by\nmisuse of the judicial process but the time\ntaken by the accused in pursuing legal and\nconstitutional remedies cannot be taken\nagainst him. The Court nevertheless cautious\nwhich we have reproduced as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">            &quot;We must take this opportunity to\n impress upon the Government of India and\n the State Governments that petitions filed\n under <a href=\"/doc/1008926/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 72</a> and <a href=\"/doc/873751/\" id=\"a_39\">161</a> of the Constitution\n or under <a href=\"/doc/1464506/\" id=\"a_40\">Sections 432</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1275473/\" id=\"a_41\">433</a> of the\n Criminal Procedure Code must be disposed of\n expeditiously. A self-imposed rule should be\n followed by the        executive authorities\n rigorously, that every such petition shall be\n disposed of within a period of three months\n from the date on which it is received. Long\n and interminable delays in the disposal of\n\f                               Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                  No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                 28</span>\n         these petitions are a serious hurdle in the\n         dispensation of justice and indeed, such\n         delays tend to shake the confidence of the\n         people in the very system of justice. Several\n         instances can be cited, to which the record of\n         this Court will bear testimony, in which\n         petitions are pending before the State\n         Governments and the Government of India\n         for an inexplicably long period. The latest\n         instance is to be found in Criminal Writ\n         Petition Nos. 345-348 of 1983, from which it\n         would appear that petitions filed under\n         <a href=\"/doc/873751/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 161</a> of the Constitution are pending\n         before the Governor of Jammu &amp; Kashmir for\n         anything between five to eight years. A\n         pernicious impression seems to be growing\n         that whatever the courts may decide, one can\n         always turn to the executive for defeating the\n         verdict of the court by resorting to delaying\n         tactics. Undoubtedly, the executive has the\n         power, in appropriate cases, to act under the\n         aforesaid provisions but, if we may remind,\n         all exercise of power is pre-conditioned by the\n         duty to be fair and quick. Delay defeats\n         justice.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">12.   We have also examined the case law on this aspect with\n\nrespect to other jurisdictions.   We may refer to a few such\n\ndecisions.   It has been repeatedly emphasized that the death\n\nsentence has two underlying philosophies ;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">         (1) that it should be retributive, and\n         (2) it should act as a deterrent\n\f                               Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">                                  No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                 29</span>\nand as the delay has the effect of obliterating both the above\n\nfactors, there can be no justification for the execution of a\n\nprisoner   after   much    delay.    Some    extremely   relevant\n\nobservations have been quoted above from Coleman               v.\n\nBalkcom, 451 U.S. 949, 952 (1981).          While examining the\n\nmatter in the background of the Eighth Amendment to the U.S.\n\nConstitution which provides that :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">          &quot;excessive bail should not be required,\n      nor excessive fine imposed, nor cruel and\n      unusual punishment inflicted&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"> it has observed that though the death penalty was permissible,\n\n its effect was lost in case of delay (Gregg v. Georgia, 428 U.S.\n\n 153 (1976).       The Court also has repeatedly examined the\n\n consequences on a prisoner who was under the spectre of\n\n death over a period of time and has emphasised &quot;when a\n\n prisoner sentenced by a Court to death is confined in the\n\n penitentiary awaiting the execution of the sentence, one of the\n\n most horrible feelings to which he can be subjected during\n\n that time is the uncertainty during the whole of it&quot;. The U.S.\n\n Supreme Court and other courts have repeatedly held that\n\f                              Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                 No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                30</span>\n&quot;the cruelty of capital punishment lies not only in the\n\nexecution itself and the pain incident thereto, but also in the\n\ndehumanizing effects of the lengthy imprisonment prior to\n\nexecution&quot;     and that     &quot;the prospect of pending execution\n\nexacts a frightful toll during the inevitable long wait between\n\nthe imposition of sentence and the actual infliction of\n\ndeath&quot;.(Furman v. Georgia 408 U.S. 238, 288-289 (1972)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">13.   We are of the opinion that the underlying principles of\n\nthe Eighth Amendment with regard to the infliction of a cruel\n\nand unusual punishment has its echo in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 21</a> of our\n\nConstitution as well and it would, therefore, be open to a\n\ncondemned prisoner, who has been under a sentence of death\n\nover a long period of time, for reasons not attributable to him,\n\nto contend that the death sentence should be commuted to\n\none of life. The power of the President and the Governor to\n\ngrant pardon etc. under <a href=\"/doc/1008926/\" id=\"a_44\">Articles 72</a> and <a href=\"/doc/873751/\" id=\"a_45\">161</a> of our\n\nConstitution   though     couched   in   imperative   terms,   has\n\nnevertheless to be exercised on the advice of the executive\n\nauthority. In this background, it is the Government which, in\n\f                             Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                               31</span>\neffect, exercises that power. The condemned prisoner and his\n\nsuffering relatives have, therefore, a very pertinent right in\n\ninsisting that a decision in the matter be taken within a\n\nreasonable time, failing which the power should be exercised\n\nin favour of the prisoner.    We, as Judges, remain largely\n\nunaware as to the reasons that ultimately bear with the\n\nGovernment in taking a decision either in favour of the\n\nprisoner or against him but whatever the decision it should be\n\non sound legal principles related to the facts of the case. We\n\nmust, however, say with the greatest emphasis, that human\n\nbeings are not chattels and should not be used as pawns in\n\nfurthering some larger political or government policy. We may\n\nhark back to our own experiences in life. Even a matter as\n\nmundane or trivial as the impending result of an examination\n\nor the report of a medical test arising out of suspicion of a\n\nserious disease, or the fate of a loved one who has gone\n\nmissing or a person hanging between life and death on\n\naccount of a severe injury, makes it impossible for a person to\n\nmaintain his equanimity or normal way of life. Contrast this\n\nwith the plight of a prisoner who has been under a sentence of\n\f                            Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                               No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                              32</span>\ndeath for 15 years or more living on hope but engulfed in fear\n\nas his life hangs in balance and in the hands of those who\n\nhave no personal interest in his case and for whom he is only\n\na name. Equally, consider the plight of the family of such a\n\nprisoner, his parents, wife and children, brothers and sisters,\n\nwho too remain static and in a state of limbo and are unable\n\nto get on with life on account of the uncertain fate of a loved\n\none. What makes it worse for the prisoner is the indifference\n\nand ennui which ultimately develops in the family, brought\n\nabout by a combination of resignation, exhaustion, and\n\ndespair.   What may be asked is the fault of these hapless\n\nindividuals and should they be treated in such a shabby\n\nmanner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">14.   The observations reproduced above become extremely\n\nrelevant as of today on account of the pendency of 26 mercy\n\npetitions before the President of India, in some cases, where\n\nthe Courts had awarded the death sentences more than a\n\ndecade ago.   We, too, take this opportunity to remind the\n\f                             Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                               33</span>\nconcerned    Governments    of    their   obligations   under   the\n\naforementioned statutory and Constitutional provisions.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">15.   Those of us who have had the occasion to inspect a Jail\n\nwhere executions are carried out have first hand knowledge of\n\nthe agony and horror that a condemned prisoner undergoes\n\nevery day.      The very terminology used to identify such\n\nprisoners - death row in-mates, or condemned prisoners, with\n\ntheir even more explicit translations in the vernacular - tend to\n\nremind them of their plight every moment of the day.             In\n\naddition to the solitary confinement and lack of privacy with\n\nrespect to even the daily ablutions, the rattle on the cell door\n\nheralding the arrival of the Jailor with the prospect as the\n\nharbinger of bad news, a condemned prisoner lives a life of\n\nuncertainty and defeat. In one particular prison, the horror\n\nwas exacerbated as the gallows could be seen over the wall\n\nfrom the condemned cells.        The effect on the prisoners on\n\nseeing this menacing structure each morning during their\n\ndaily exercise in the courtyard, can well be imagined.     To cap\n\nit all, some of these prisoners, sentenced to death by the\n\f                             Criminal Appeal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                No.338/2007</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">                               34</span>\nSessions Judge in a case of multiple murders, were later\n\nacquitted by the High Court in appeal for lack of evidence.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">16.   The facts of the present case; the incident happened on\n\nthe 20th August 2005.        The Additional Sessions Judge\n\nrendered his judgment on 24th April 2006 and the judgment\n\nwas confirmed by the High Court on 27th June 2006.                  This\n\nmatter first came up in this Court on 1st September 2006 and\n\nwas adjourned repeatedly on the request of the appellant&#x27;s\n\ncounsel so as to find out if some material could be collected to\n\nsubstantiate his claim that he was unsound mind and it was\n\non 12th March 2007 that leave was granted limited to the\n\nquestion of sentence only.
