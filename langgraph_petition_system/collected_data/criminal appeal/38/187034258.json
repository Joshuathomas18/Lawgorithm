The High Court even disbelieved the story of \n\n\n\n       the prosecution with regard to accused No.4 taking \n\n\n\n       room at `Ambika Niwas&#x27; on Leave and Licence basis. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">       As   a   consequence   of   the   aforesaid   facts,   accused \n\n\n\n       Nos. 1, 2, 3 and 4 were acquitted. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">27.      In  our   opinion,   these   conclusions   recorded   by   the \n\n\n\n       High Court have destroyed the entire substratum of \n\n\n\n       the   prosecution   case.   Having   disbelieved   the   entire \n\n\n\n       prosecution   version,   the   High   Court   proceeds   to \n\n\n\n       distinguish   the   case   of   the   appellant.   The   only \n\n\n\n       additional   circumstance   relied   upon   by   the   High \n\n\n\n       Court   against   the   appellant   is   that   his   voice   was \n\n\n\n       identified   by   the   officer   Jagdish   Kulkarni,   PW-19, \n\n\n\n       who had taken him in custody.  The voice of Bharat \n\n\n\n       Nepali   was   also   identified   by   PW-18,   A.C.P. \n\n\n\n       Tejasingh Chavan.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                              24</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">28.    We are of the considered opinion that the approach \n\n\n\n       adopted   by   the   High   Court   was   wholly   erroneous. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">       Having   disbelieved   the   voice   identification   in   the \n\n\n\n       case of accused Nos. 1 and 2, there was no reason \n\n\n\n       to   adopt   a   different   yardstick   in   the   case   of   the \n\n\n\n       appellant   herein.     The   High   Court   discarded   the \n\n\n\n       evidence   of   PW-36,   A.P.I.   Dilip   Raut   and   PW-38, \n\n\n\n       A.P.I. Pasalkar mainly on the ground                       that \n\n\n\n       they   were   accompanying   the   raiding   party \n\n\n\n       on 8th  November, 2004 and had not heard the voice \n\n\n\n       of   accused   Nos.   1   and   2   prior   thereto.     Another \n\n\n\n       reason given by the High Court is that these officers \n\n\n\n       being   members   of   the   investigating   team   were \n\n\n\n       interested   in   successful   completion   of   the \n\n\n\n       investigation.     But   the   same   yardstick   was   not \n\n\n\n       applied   to   the   voice   identification   of   absconding \n\n\n\n       accused   Bharat   Nepali   by   Tejasingh   Chavan,   PW-\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">       18.     He   was   also   attached   to   DCP   CID   when   the \n\n\n\n       present offence was registered.  He would, therefore, \n\n\n\n       also   be   equally   interested   in   successful   completion \n\n\n\n       of the investigation.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                                                25</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">29.    Similarly,   voice   identification   of   the   appellant   by \n\n\n\n       Jagdish Kulkarni, PW-19 would also suffer from the \n\n\n\n       same weakness as he was also attached to the office \n\n\n\n       of   DCP   CID.     The   High   Court   also   ignored   the   fact \n\n\n\n       that the witnesses were being asked to identify  the \n\n\n\n       voice of Bharat Nepali, which they had last heard in \n\n\n\n       the   year   1997.     Similarly,   PW-19,   Jagdish   Kularni \n\n\n\n       had   only   heard   the   voice   of   appellant   in   the   year \n\n\n\n       2002.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">30.    In our opinion, the evidence of voice identification is \n\n\n\n       at best suspect, if not, wholly unreliable.   Accurate \n\n\n\n       voice   identification   is   much   more   difficult   than \n\n\n\n       visual   identification.     It   is   prone   to   such   extensive \n\n\n\n       and   sophisticated   tampering,   doctoring   and   editing \n\n\n\n       that   the   reality   can   be   completely   replaced   by \n\n\n\n       fiction.   Therefore,   the   Courts   have   to   be   extremely \n\n\n\n       cautious   in   basing   a   conviction   purely   on   the \n\n\n\n       evidence   of   voice   identification.     This   Court,   in   a \n\n\n\n       number of judgments emphasised the importance of \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                                26</span>\n\n\f\n                     the precautions, which are necessary to be taken in \n\n\n\n                     placing   any   reliance   on   the   evidence   of   voice \n\n\n\n                     identification.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"382199\" id=\"span_30\">In   the   case   of          <a href=\"/doc/382199/\" id=\"a_31\">Ziyauddin \n\n\n                     Burhanuddin   Bukhari  Vs.

There is no seizure of any mobile phone or even sim \n\n\n\n       card at the behest of the appellant.

This   apart,   the   High   Court   erroneously   overlooked \n\n\n\n       the   infirmities   in   the   evidence   with   regard   to   the \n\n\n\n       authenticity   of   the   tape   recording   produced   in \n\n\n\n       Court.

The   incriminating \n\n\n\n       conversation was said to have been recorded on 28th \n\n\n\n       October, 2004.    This conversation  was  relayed  to  a \n\n\n\n       police telephone and recorded.  He put a slip on the \n\n\n\n       recorded cassette indicating the date and time of the \n\n\n\n       conversation as recorded.  He then handed the tape \n\n\n\n       over to the D.C.P., Dhananjay Kamlakar.   He heard \n\n\n\n       the   tape   on   the   same   day.     Even   though   the \n\n\n\n       conversation   revealed   a   conspiracy   for   commission \n\n\n\n       of   a   serious   offence,   like   murder   of   an   influential \n\n\n\n       personality   in   Mumbai   city,   he   took   no   further \n\n\n\n       action.     He   just   sealed   the   tape   and   kept   it   in   his \n\n\n\n       personal custody.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">39.

It   was   kept   by \n\n\n\n       Kamlakar   till   17th         January,   2005,   when   he \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                                    37</span>\n\n\f\n       instructed P.S.I. Vijay Dalvi to hand over the tape to \n\n\n\n       the Inspector of Police. It is a matter of record that \n\n\n\n       the tape was received by the Investigating Officer on \n\n\n\n       18th  January,   2005.     Even   the   trial   court   refers   to \n\n\n\n       the  inaction  on  the  part   of  the       D.C.P.   Dhananjay \n\n\n\n       Kamlakar   as   shocking.   Thereafter,   the   High   Court \n\n\n\n       observed as follows:-\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">       &quot;The   evidence   of   DCP   Dhananjay   Kamlakar \n\n       suggest   that   he   had   forgotten   about   the \n\n       existence   of   the   tape   and   only   when \n\n       Investigating   Officer   asked   about   the   tape   he \n\n       remembered,   checked   his   record   and   then \n\n       informed   the   investigating   officer   that   he   had \n\n       such   tape   in   his   custody.     It   is   not   easy   to \n\n       believe   this   story   given   by   DCP   Dhananjay \n\n       Kamlakar   as   he   was   a   highly   trained   and   a \n\n       Senior   IPS   Officer.     The   least   which   he   could \n\n       had   done   was   to   find   out   from   the   telephone \n\n       companies  as to who was the recipient of this \n\n       call   from   the   number   under   surveillance.     He \n\n       made   no   efforts   to   find   out   as   to   who   had \n\n       received   this   call.     The   conduct   of   this   officer \n\n       leads   me   to   believe   that   this   tape   was \n\n       suppressed   for   some   reasons   which   best \n\n       known to DCP Kamlakar.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">40.    Having   concluded   as   such,   the   High   Court, \n\n\n\n       however,   proceeds   to   hold   that   even   such   lapses \n\n\n\n       cannot   enure   to   the   benefit   of   the   appellant.   The \n\n\n\n       High   Court   believed   the   recording   as   it   had   been \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                                                  38</span>\n\n\f\n       made   upon   prior   approval   by   the   Home   Secretary \n\n\n\n       given on 20th October, 2004. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">41.    In   our   opinion,   the   veracity   of   the   voice \n\n\n\n       identification   would   not   improve   merely   because   a \n\n\n\n       recording   has   been   made   after   receiving   official \n\n\n\n       approval.  The crucial identification was of the voice \n\n\n\n       of   the   person   talking   on   the   tape.   We   are   of   the \n\n\n\n       considered   opinion   that   the   High   Court   has \n\n\n\n       committed   a   grave   error   in   confirming   the \n\n\n\n       conviction   of   the   appellant   as  recorded  by   the   trial \n\n\n\n       court only on the evidence of voice identification.  \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">42.    Other   circumstance   relied   upon   by   the   High   Court \n\n\n\n       in   convicting   the   appellant   is   the   recovery   of   the \n\n\n\n       alleged revolver from the house of the cousin of the \n\n\n\n       appellant. In our opinion, the recovery from an open \n\n\n\n       space, at the back of the house, which did not even \n\n\n\n       belong to the appellant, could be of little assistance \n\n\n\n       to   the   prosecution.     Even   otherwise   it   needs   to   be \n\n\n\n       remembered   that   the   trial   court   had   in   fact, \n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                                                39</span>\n\n\f\n       acquitted   the   appellant   for   the   offences   under \n\n\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1092263/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 3</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1601096/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 5</a> of the Arms Act.  This \n\n\n\n       acquittal   was   never   challenged   by   the   prosecution \n\n\n\n       in appeal.  Therefore, it was wholly inappropriate by \n\n\n\n       the   High   Court   to   reverse   the   findings   of   the   trial \n\n\n\n       court in the absence of an appeal by the State.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_95\">43.      In   view   of   the   above,   we   are   of   the   considered \n\n\n\n       opinion   that   the   appellant   was   entitled   to   the \n\n\n\n       benefit   of   doubt   as   the   prosecution   has   failed   to \n\n\n\n       prove   its   case   beyond   reasonable   doubt. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\">       Consequently, the appeal is allowed.
