Validity          of      the       Criminal           Law (Amendment)\n\nOrdinance, 1944 (hereinafter referred to as &#x27;the Ordinance&#x27;)\n\nand jurisdiction of District Judge under the Ordinance after\n\nenactment of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_1\">Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988</a> (in short\n\n&#x27;<a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_2\">P.C. Act</a>&#x27;) are the main questions to be considered in these\n\ncases. In Crl. Appeal No.1400 of 2007 appellant was facing\n\ninvestigation for the case registered against him for the\n\noffence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1259316/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 13 (2)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 13\n\n(1) (e)</a> of the P.C. Act alleging that the appellant had\n\namassed wealth disproportionate to his income.                            The check\n\nperiod is 1.1.1994 to 12.5.2005.                 While the investigation was\n\ncontinuing, an application was filed by the Investigating\n\nOfficer before the District Court for attachment of his\n\nproperties invoking provisions of <a href=\"/doc/581728/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/616856/\" id=\"a_6\">5</a> of the\n\nOrdinance.   The District Court passed an order attaching\n\ncertain properties scheduled in the petition.                          When the case\n\ncame up for admission, after admitting the appeal, referred\n\nthe case to Division Bench as some important questions of law\n\f\nCrl.

When petition for attachment\n\nwas filed under the above Ordinance, preliminary objection\n\nwas filed to decide the question of maintainability of the\n\npetition by the petitioners in Crl.M.C.No.2526 of 2007.\n\nThat petition was dismissed.          After that order, the above\n\nCrl. M.C. was filed under <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 482</a> of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure.         The very same petitioners applied for\n\nproduction of certain documents.           Those petitions were\n\ndismissed.        Hence, they again filed Crl.M.C.No.2559 of\n\n2007.       Since    criminal   appeal involving  almost  similar\n\npoints were referred to the Division Bench, these criminal\n\nmiscellaneous petitions were also referred to the        Division\n\nBench.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">             2.

Years rolled by and\n             experience gathered      showed that   unless a\n             special forum for the trial of such offences\n             as enumerated in the 1947 Act is created,\n             the object      underlying th   1947  Act would\n             remain a distant dream.        This led to the\n             enactment of the <a href=\"/doc/544006/\" id=\"a_87\">Criminal Law Amendment Act,\n             1952</a>.     The Statement of Objects and Reasons\n             accompanying      the   Bill   refers  to   the\n             recommendations of the Committee chaired by\n             Dr. Bakshi Tek Chand appointed to review the\n             working of the Special Police Establishment\n             and to make recommendations for improvement\n             of laws relating to bribery and corruption.\n             To take the cases of corruption out of the\n             maze of cases handled by Magistrates, it was\n             decided to set up special courts. <a href=\"/doc/608297/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 6</a>\n             conferred power on the State Government to\n             appoint as many Special Judges as may be\n             necessary with power to try the offences set\n             out in clauses (a) and (b).      Now if at this\n             stage a reference is made to <a href=\"/doc/909219/\" id=\"a_89\">section 6</a> of\n             the     Code    of  Criminal   Procedure  which\n             provides      for   constitution   of  criminal\n             courts, it would become clear that a new\n             court with a new designation was being set\n             up    and    that  it  has   to  be  under  the\n             administrative and judicial superintendence\n             of the High Court.     As  already pointed out,\n             there were four types of criminal courts\n             functioning under the High Court.       To this\n             list was added the Court of a Special Judge.\n             Now when a new court which is indisputably a\n             criminal court because it was not even\n\f\nCrl. Appeal No.1400/2007 &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">Crl.M.C.Nos.2526 &amp; 2559/2007       18</span>\n\n             whispered that the Court of Special Judge is\n             not a criminal court, is set up, to make it\n             effective     and   functionally  oriented,  it\n             becomes necessary to prescribe its powers,\n             procedure,      status    and   all   ancillary\n             provisions.     While setting up a Court of a\n             Special Judge keeping in view the fact that\n             the high      dignitaries in  public  life are\n             likely to be tried by such a court, the\n             qualification prescribed was that the person\n             to be appointed as Special Judge has to be\n             either a Sessions Judge, Additional Sessions\n             Judge or Assistant Sessions Judge.        These\n             three dignitaries are above the level of a\n             Magistrate.          After    prescribing   the\n             qualification, the Legislature proceeded to\n             confer power upon a Special Judge to take\n             cognizance of      offences for  the  trial of\n             which      a  special   court   with  exclusive\n             jurisdiction was being set up.     If a Special\n             Judge has to take cognizance of offences,\n             ipso facto the procedure for trial of such\n             offences has to be prescribed.     Now the Code\n             prescribes different procedures for trial of\n             cases by different courts.        Procedure for\n             trial of a case before a Court of Session is\n             set out in Chapter XVIII; trial of warrant\n             cases by Magistrates is set out in Chapter\n             XIX    and   the  provisions  therein  included\n             catered to both the      types of cases coming\n             before the Magistrate, namely, upon police\n             report or otherwise than on a police report.\n             Chapter     XX  prescribes  the  procedure  for\n             trial of summons cases by Magistrates and\n             Chapter XXI      prescribes the  procedure  for\n             summary trial.       Now that a new criminal\n             court was being set up, the Legislature took\n             the first step of providing its comparative\n             position in the hierarchy of courts under\n             <a href=\"/doc/608297/\" id=\"a_90\">section 6</a> Cr. P.C. by bringing it on level\n             more or less comparable to the Court of\n             Session, but in order to avoid any confusion\n             arising out of comparison by level, it was\n             made explicit in <a href=\"/doc/105836713/\" id=\"a_91\">section 8 (1)</a> itself that\n             it is not a Court of Session because it can\n             take      cognizance    of   offences   without\n             commitment as contemplated by section 193\n\f\nCrl.

Undoubtedly, in <a href=\"/doc/733974/\" id=\"a_92\">section 8 (3)</a> it\n             was clearly laid down that subject to the\n             provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) of\n             <a href=\"/doc/733974/\" id=\"a_93\">section 8</a>, the Court of Special Judge shall\n             be deemed to be a Court of Sessions trying\n             cases without a jury or without the aid of\n             assessors.       In contra-distinction  to  the\n             Sessions Court this new court was to be a\n             court     of   original jurisdiction.       The\n             Legislature then proceeded to specify which\n             out of the various procedures set out in the\n             Code, this new court shall follow for trial\n             of    offences   before  it.    <a href=\"/doc/105836713/\" id=\"a_94\">Section  8  (1)</a>\n             specifically says that a Special Judge in\n             trial of offences before him shall follow\n             the procedure      prescribed in  the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_95\">Code of\n             Criminal     Procedure</a>  for  trial  of  warrant\n             cases by Magistrates.       The provisions for\n             trial of warrant cases by the magistrate are\n             to be found in Chapter XXI of 1898 Code.      A\n             glance through the provisions will show that\n             the provisions therein included catered to\n             both the situations namely, trial of a case\n             initiated upon police report (section 251-A)\n             and trial of cases instituted otherwise than\n             on police report (section 252 to 257).     If a\n             Special Judge is enjoined with a duty to try\n             cases according to the procedure prescribed\n             in foregoing      provisions he  will  have to\n             first decide whether the case was instituted\n             upon a police report or otherwise than on\n             police report and follow the procedure in\n             the relevant group of sections. Each of the\n             sections 251-A to 257 of 1898 Code which are\n             in pari materia with sections 238 to 250 of\n             1973 Code      refers to  what  the Magistrate\n             should do.     Does the Special Judge therefore\n             become a Magistrate?     This is the fallacy of\n             the whole approach.      In fact, in order to\n             give full effect to <a href=\"/doc/105836713/\" id=\"a_96\">section 8 (1)</a>, the only\n             thing to do is to tread Special Judge in\n             sections 238 to 250 wherever the expression\n             &#x27;Magistrate&#x27; occurs.     This is what is called\n             legislation by      incorporation.   Similarly,\n             where     the  question  of  taking  cognizance\n             arises, it is futile to go in search of the\n             fact whether for purposes of section 190\n\f\nCrl.

What is to be done\n             is that      one has   to  read the expression\n             &#x27;Special Judge&#x27; in place of      Magistrate, and\n             the whole thing becomes crystal clear.      The\n             Legislature wherever it found the grey area\n             clarified it by making specific provision\n             such     as   the  one  in  sub-section  (2)  of\n             <a href=\"/doc/733974/\" id=\"a_97\">section 8</a> and to leave no one in doubt\n             further provided in sub-section (3) that all\n             the    provisions   of   the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_98\">Code  of  Criminal\n             Procedure</a> shall      so far   as  they are not\n             inconsistent     with  the  Act   apply  to  the\n             proceedings before a Special Judge. At the\n             time when the 1952 Act was enacted what was\n             in    operation    was  the  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_99\">Code   of  Criminal\n             Procedure</a>, 1898.       It did not envisage any\n             Court of a Special Judge and the Legislature\n             never wanted to draw up an exhaustive Code\n             of Procedure for this new criminal court\n             which was      being set   up.    Therefore, it\n             conferred      power   (taking   cognizance   of\n             offence),     prescribed   procedure  (trial  of\n             warrant cases by a Magistrate), indicated\n             authority to tender pardon (section 338) and\n             then      after    declaring   its   status   as\n             comparable to a Court of Session proceeded\n             to prescribe that all provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_100\">Code\n             of Criminal Procedure</a> will apply in so far\n             as    they    are  not  inconsistent   with  the\n             provisions of the 1952 Act.      The net outcome\n             of this position is that a new court of\n             original      jurisdiction   was  set   up   and\n             whenever a question arose as to what are its\n             powers      in  respect  of  specific  questions\n             brought     before  it   as  court  of  original\n             criminal jurisdiction, it had to refer to\n             the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_101\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> undaunted by\n             any     designation   claptrap.

I do not agree with the above\n             submissions. Admittedly, the Special Court\n             for     ACB  cases   is  constituted  with   the\n             jurisdiction specified in the annexure to the\n             enactment.       The  properties  sought  to  be\n             attached are within the jurisdiction of the\n             Special Judge     for ACB cases, Visakhapatnam.\n             Certainly the Special Judge has power to\n             order attachment even in cases which are at\n             the investigation stage. If literal meaning\n             is given to the term &#x27;District Judge&#x27; used in\n             <a href=\"/doc/581728/\" id=\"a_114\">section     3</a>  of  the  Criminal  Law  Amendment\n             Ordinance, 1944, it would result in dichotomy\n             of the jurisdiction and such interpretation\n             is not called for.      The Special Judge is of\n             the rank of the District Judge.       If he has\n             power     to  order  attachment  during   trial,\n             certainly he has power to        pass any order\n             axillary to his powers even when the case is\n             at the investigation stage.      It is the ACB\n             Department     which is dealing with the case\n             and doing investigation and, therefore, only\n             the     Special   Judge   has  power   to   pass\n             attachment of the property even at the stage\n             of investigation as is done in this case.\n             Interpretation given by the learned Special\n             Judge      with   regard   to   the   harmonious\n             construction is correct. Hence, there is no\n             ground to interfere with the impugned order\n             and the Revision is accordingly dismissed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_50\">There, the only reason given by the learned single Judge\n\nwas that if the power is vested with the District Judge for\n\nattachment,       it   will  create  dichotomy  of  jurisdiction.\n\nHence, the Special Judge who is vested with jurisdiction\n\f\nCrl.

Learned counsel for the appellant also\n\nsubmitted that by virtue of power under <a href=\"/doc/42036/\" id=\"a_115\">section 5 (6)</a>\n\nSpecial Judge is entrusted with power of the District Judge\n\nfor     attachment       under   the  Ordinance   even   at   the\n\ninvestigation stage before trial started.            It is also\n\nargued that the word &#x27;trial&#x27; is not defined.         Hence, from\n\nthe    registration       of  the  case  till  pronouncement   of\n\njudgment, the case is under trial in a broader view.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">             12. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"394676\" id=\"span_34\">In <a href=\"/doc/394676/\" id=\"a_116\">Rongala Mohan Rao</a>&#x27;s case (supra), learned\n\nsingle Judge of the Andhra Pradesh High Court did not refer\n\nto any earlier decisions.

Pre-trial proceedings were\n\ndone by the Magistrate&#x27;s Court and after committal, trial\n\nwas conducted by the Sessions Court.

P.C. provides that the\n\nMagistrate shall supply police report and also 161 statement\n\nto the accused free of cost. So, trial can start after\n\nsupply of police report.        In cases not coming under police\n\nreport, trial starts on appearance of the person under\n\nchapter XIXB.         Hence, a reading of the provisions of Cr.\n\nP.C. together with <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_156\">P.C.

That meaning attaches to\n             the words in those sections having regard to\n             the context in which they are used.       There\n             is no reason why where these words are used\n             in another context in the code, they should\n             necessarily be limited in their connotation\n             and significance.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">In section 321, specific provision is made for enabling the\n\nPublic Prosecutor to withdraw the case even before charge\n\nhas been framed.         Trial can be conducted by a civil court\n\nor tribunal or before quasi-judicial authority when parties\n\nare summoned before the stage and when respondent is asked\n\nto appear       to   be   present in  court.  Unlike  &#x27;trial&#x27;  in\n\nelection     petition     or  &#x27;trial&#x27;  before  a  tribunal  under\n\nspecial Acts, the word &#x27;trial&#x27; has got an accepted meaning\n\nin criminal jurisprudence and it starts only while judicial\n\nproceeding starts and not before that.

In ascertaining the meaning of an\n             expression used in a statute, certain norms\n             are adopted. If the legislature has used an\n             expression which has acquired a technical\n             meaning      and   such   expression  is    used\n             ordinarily in the context of a particular\n             branch     of  law,  it  must  be  assumed  that\n             because of its constant use the legislature\n             must be deemed to have used such expression\n             in a particular sense as is understood when\n             used in a similar context.     If an expression\n             has acquired a special connotation in law,\n             dictionary or general meaning ceases to be\n             helpful in interpreting such a word. Such an\n             expression must be given its legal sense and\n             no other.      In this context, we may refer to\n             the weighty observation in the decision of\n             this Court in State of Madras v. Gannon\n             Dunkerley &amp; Co. (Madras) Ltd.

If    the     expression\n             &#x27;undischarged     insolvent&#x27;   has  acquired   a\n             special meaning under the law of insolvency,\n             we must understand that that is the meaning\n             that    is   sought  to  be  attributed  to  the\n             expression used in <a href=\"/doc/1779906/\" id=\"a_158\">Article 191       (1) (c)</a> of\n             the Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">In criminal law, the trial starts only when court takes\n\ncognizance       of    the  case   and  ends  when   judgment is\n\npronounced.

Komalam,\n\nsister of Smt. K.K. Sumathy, w/o. Dr. V.K. Rajan, the\n\naccused; (4) during 2005, he had withdrawn two of his FD&#x27;s\n\nfrom the Federal Bank, Banerji Road, Ernakulam.             The\n\ndetails of FD&#x27;s withdrawn FD No.24218 and 24219 of Federal\n\nBank, Banerji Road, Ernakulam were also stated.

Along with the application, respondent had\n\nfiled a schedule of the property which included about 11\n\ndifferent properties.        An ad interim order of attachment\n\nwas passed under <a href=\"/doc/731949/\" id=\"a_197\">section 4</a> of the Ordinance.

Value of the\n\nproperty mentioned in item No.5 in the schedule alone is\n\nmore than 72 lakhs.        Appellant&#x27;s wife was also employed and\n\nher income was not included.

There    is   a  difference  between the  scheme   of\n\nattachment proceeding under the ordinance and one under\n\nOrder 38 Rule 5 of the Civil Procedure Code.           Here, the\n\nordinance contemplates making of an ad interim attachment\n\nand then a notice to show causes why it should not be made\n\nabsolute while under the code the notice is issued to show\n\ncause why an attachment should not be made and in issuing\n\nsuch a notice the court may or may not grant an ad interim\n\nattachment.       Any person who has an interest in the property\n\ncan approach the court under <a href=\"/doc/1843974/\" id=\"a_199\">section 4 (4)</a> of the Ordinance\n\nfor lifting the attachment.
