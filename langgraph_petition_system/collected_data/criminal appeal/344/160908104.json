The evidence adduced is of circumstantial in nature. There is no eye witness account, the appellant and other co-accused Ram Chandra have been convicted with the help of <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_31\">sections 106</a> and <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_32\">114</a> of the Evidence Act. The reliance has been placed by the trial court mainly on the statement of P.W. 1 Ashok Kumar Gupta, P.W. 3 Suresh Chandra and P.W. 4 Hasin Uddin, P.W. 2 Rais Ahmad has been disbelieved by the trial court. In the present case the co-accused Ram Chandra Gupta has filed criminal appeal no. 1517 of 1999, the same has been dismissed. It is a case in which it has to consider whether the appellants Pankaj Kumar Gupta and Atul Pandey alias Babloo were present at the time and place of commission of the  alleged offence and the fact of murder was specially within their knowledge and the burden of proving that fact was upon him. According to <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_33\">section 114</a> of the Evidence Act, the Court may presume the existence of any fact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the common  course of natural events, human conduct and public and private business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">\tBut combined effect of the provision of <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_34\">sections 106</a> and <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_35\">114</a> of the Evidence Act is that any case where only accused can have the knowledge about incriminating circumstances, it is for him to explain and if he does not do so, an inference of guilt may be drawn. According to the evidence adduced in the present case no explanation of the death of the deceased has been given by the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta, Atul Pandey alias Babloo, now it has to be decided whether the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta and Atul Pandey alias Babloo were having special knowledge of the fact of murder of the deceased, for this purpose, circumstances proved by the prosecution requires a careful consideration.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">\tIt is established beyond doubt that the dead body of the deceased was recovered from the deep freezer of the restaurant  of the accused Ram Chandra, the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta is the son of the accused Ram Chandra Gupta, the accused Ram Chandra, the appellants Pankaj Kumar Gupta and the accused Pawan Kumar Gupta,(who has been acquitted,) were living in the same house adjoining to the restaurant. The appellant Atul Pandey alias Babloo was  a friend of the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta, he was not residing  in the house of the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta nor  working in the restaurant of the accused Ram Chandra.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_51\">\tIn case of Ram Chandra Gupta, it is held that the dead body of the deceased was recovered from the freezer in the restaurant of the accused Ram Chandra, it was for him to explain how it happened to be there and since no explanation had been offered by him, an  inference of guilt against him was drawn. It has come in the statement of P.W. 1 Ashok Kumar Gupta that Amrit Sagar restaurant was on the first floor  of  the house of Ram Chandra. The house of the first informant Ashok Kumar Gupta was adjoining to the house of accused Ram Chandra. The first informant Ashok Kumar Gupta and the accused Ram Chandra are the real brothers but the house of Ram Chandra was in west side of the house of Ashok Kumar, for going to the roof of the house of Ram Chandra, there were stairs, the   accused Ram Chandra was running Amrit Sagar restaurant, the first informant Ashok Kumar Gupta was having a shop in his house. At about 7.00-7.15 p.m. the informant and his son (deceased) were sitting at  their shop, the appellant Pankaj had come there to provide a telephone number. The appellant Atul Pandey alias Babloo was standing outside the shop. The appellant Pankaj after having some conversation with the appellant Atul Pandey alias Babloo went to the Armit Sagar restaurant. The deceased Amit dialed the telephone number provided by the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta, but the same could not be connected, then it was suspected that the telephone number was not correct, to know correct telephone number Amit also went to Pankaj in the   restaurant, thereafter the deceased Amit was not seen coming out from the  restaurant. At about 8.00 p.m. the shop was closed  by the first informant and a call was made to Amit, which was not responded. At that time the accused Ram Chandra was standing at the door of his house. He was also enquired, who stated that the deceased Amit was not present in the house.  At that time the appellant Pankaj and the co-accused Pawan were also residing in that house. According to the deposition of P.W. 1, only appellant Pankaj entered into Amrit Sagar restaurant after providing the telephone number to the deceased at his shop and the appellant Atul Pandey alias Babloo was standing outside the shop, before entering into the restaurant, the appellant Pankaj was having  some conversation with the appellant Atul Pandey alias Babloo but it has not been deposed by P.W.1 that the appellant Atul Pandey alias Babloo also entered into the restaurant. He categorically stated in his examination in chief that he alongwith his wife remained in the verandah of his house for whole night waiting for  the arrival of his son Amit. From the place where P.W.1 was standing everything was visible on the ground. He stated that about 12 O&#x27; clock, the appellant Pankaj came back and entered into his house, till morning nobody entered into the house of Ram Chandra and nobody came out from the house. P.W. 1 has not disclosed the fact that the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta after entering into the restaurant came out from the restaurant/house, but contrary to it he deposed that at about 12 O&#x27; clock the appellant Pankaj returned and entered into the house. According to his deposition &#x27;no time of exit&#x27; of the appellant Pankaj from the house/restaurant has been given  even he is silent about the exit of the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta from his restaurant/house.  In cross examination also in this regard no deposition has been made. This fact has not been disclosed by P.W.1 in his statement recorded 161 <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_36\">Cr.P.C</a>., even he has not disclosed  that the appellant Pankaj returned and entered into his house at about 12 O&#x27;clock. In the present case, the material fact is  that the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta, came to the shop of the first informant and provided telephone number, the deceased dialed the same telephone number, but the same could not be connected, then he went to the restaurant to take correct telephone number from appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta, has not been mentioned in the FIR, the fact of presence of the appellant Atul Pandey alias Babloo outside the shop of the first informant has also not been mentioned in the FIR. This fact has come in the evidence of the first informant Ashok Kumar Gupta, it has not been corroborated by any other witness. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">\t P.W. 4 Hasin Uddin deposed before the trial court that on 17.8.1995 at about 7.30 P.M. he along with his friend Mohd. Sadiq had gone to Amrit Sagar Restaurant to take the tea but outside of the restaurant the accused Ram Chandra met them who  told that the restaurant  was closed, thereafter they came near the Kutchery where they took the tea and thereafter they were returning to their house when they reached near Amrit Sagar Restaurant, they saw a crowd and came to know that son of Ashok was missing.  On the next day, he came to know that dead body was recovered from a freezer.  He deposed that on 17.8.1995, at about 7.30 P.M. when he came to Amrit Sagar Restaurant, the accused Ram Chandra was standing on the ground.  The appellants Atul and Pankaj came out from the restaurant and by riding a moped  went towards the city, at that time they were perturbed but the fact of perturbedness  was not disclosed by him before the I.O. because it was not mentioned in his statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_37\">section 161</a> Cr.P.C. Even the fact of taking out the dead body from the Freezer by the Sub Inspector and Vinod has not been mentioned in his statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_38\">section 161</a> Cr.P.C.  The P.W. 4 is a chance witness.  According to his deposition, the appellants were seen by him when they were coming out from the restaurant on 17.8.1995 at about 7.30 P.M.  At that time they were perturbed, the perturbedness is not corroborated by any witness, even the fact and coming out from the restaurant has not been corroborated by P.W. 1.  This witness has deposed first time before the trial court that both the appellants were perturbed when they were coming out from the restaurant.  Such statement has not been given by him to the I.O. In such a circumstances, such deposition of P.W. 4 Hasin Uddin for drawing any inference required serious scrutiny. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">\tFor establishing the presence of the appellants in the restaurant at the time of the commission of the alleged offence, the only evidence is of P.W.1 Ashok Kumar Gupta  and P.W.4 Hasin Uddin is available. There is no evidence to show the manner in which the deceased was killed. The FIR of this case has been lodged by P.W. 1 Ashok Kumar Gupta on 18.8.1995 at 7.30 A.M. after recovering the dead body. According to the FIR, on 17.8.1995 at about 8.00 P.M. he closed the shop and called his son Amit Kumar, but he did not respond, then the search was made but he could not be  traced out. The first informant and his wife remained in verandah of their house for whole of night and whole of the night  no person of house came out and no person entered into house. In the morning, it was informed by the accused Ram Chandra that the dead body of the deceased Amit was lying in his restaurant&#x27;s freezer, then he along with his nephew went there and saw the dead body in freezer, he alleged that the deceased was murdered and his dead body was hidden by the accused Ram Chandra and his family and according to the statement recorded before the trial court the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta came to his shop at about 7.00 P.M. and after providing the telephone number to the deceased returned back to his restaurant.  According to his deposition also, from 4 P.M. to 7.00 P.M. it was not known to him as to who came to restaurant and went out, upto 5.30 P.M. the customers came to the restaurant.  In between 6.00 P.M. to 8.P.M. the family members of Ram Chandra including Pawan, the appellants Pankaj and Atul had remained in that house.  From his statement also, it is  clear that the customer had come to the restaurant upto 5.30 P.M. There is no evidence to show that in the restaurant or at the house of Ram Chandra, only Ram Chandra, Pankaj and Atul Pandey were present and all customers had left the restaurant.  According to the deposition of P.W.1, co-accused Pawan Kumar was also present there but he has been acquitted by the trial court. The government appeal filed by the State against the order of acquittal has been dismissed.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">\tThe P.W. 1 Ashok Kumar Gupta has stated that the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta came to his shop at about 7.00 P.M. and after providing the telephone number to the deceased returned to the restaurant thereafter the deceased dialed the same number, which could not be connected, then he went to restaurant to know the correct telephone number, thereafter, he did not return. It was alarming fact, specially when the dead body was recovered from the freezer of the same restaurant and FIR was lodged after recovery of dead body but surprisingly it was not mentioned in the FIR; it appears to be an improvement made after thought, the deposition with regard to the appellants Pankaj Kumar Gupta and Atul Pandey alias Babloo is uncorroborated, therefore, no reliance may be placed on such part of the statement of P.W.1 Ashok Kumar Gupta  and he was seen at about 12.00 O&#x27;clock in the night when he came back to his house.  His statement is totally silent with regard to his exit from the restaurant/house. In such circumstances it is not safe to presume that the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta was having exclusive knowledge of the fact that the deceased Amit Kumar Gupta was  killed and his dead body was kept in deep freezer. So far as P.W. 4 is concerned he is a chance witness, coincidently he came to the restaurant at about 7.30 P.M. on 17.8.1995 where the accused Ram Chandra met him out side the restaurant who told that the restaurant was closed. In the beginning of his examination-chief he simply stated that when he came to the restaurant the accused Ram Chandra met him out side the restaurant, he did not state that the appellants Atul and Pankaj were also present there, but in the last he stated that on 17.8.1995 at about 7.30 P.M. when he came to the Amrit Sagar restaurant the accused Ram Chandra was standing there and the appellant Atul Pandey and Pankaj Kumar came out from the restaurant and by riding on a moped went towards the city at that time they were perturbed. This fact has not been supported by any other witness  even P.W. 4 himself has not stated before the I.O. that appellant Atul Pandey and Pankaj Kumar were perturbed at that time. In such circumstances, it appears to be an improvement, first time before the trial court, it is very difficult to make the reliance upon the the statement of P.W. 4 with regard to the posturing of the appellants that they were perturbed, even it is very difficult to make the reliance upon his statement that he saw the appellants Pankaj Kumar and Atul Pandey when they were coming out from restaurant at about 7.30 p.m. on 17.8.1995 because this fact has not been corroborated by any other witness.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">\tThe appellant Atul Pandey @ Babloo is not belonging to the family of Ram Chandra and the first informant Ashok Kumar Gupta. It is alleged that he was friend of appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta, he is not named in the FIR, no allegation has been made against him. According to the deposition of P.W. 8 Ram Swaroop Shakya that no evidence was available against him up to 24.8.1995 that is why he was reported to the court of C.J.M. Varanasi that he was not wanted in the present case. According to the statement of the P.W. 1 also he was present out side his shop on 17.8.1995 at about 7.00 P.M. when the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta came to his shop to provide the telephone number to the deceased. After providing the telephone number to the deceased the appellant Pankaj Kumar after having some conversation with the appellant Atul Pandey @ Babloo went to the restaurant. According to the deposition of P.W. 1 also the appellant Atul Pandey @ Babloo did not go to the restaurant/ residence of Ram Chandra. He was not seen by P.W. 1 entering into the restaurant or exiting from the restaurant. According to his deposition before the trial court  only the appellant Pankaj returned to his house at about 12 O&#x27;clock in night. According to his deposition the appellant Atul Pandey was not in his company. The next evidence against him is of P.W. 4 Hasin uddin. According to his deposition he saw the appellant Atul Pandey in the company of appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta when they were coming out from the restaurant on 17.8.1995 at about 7.30 P.M., at that time  they were perturbed. But with regard to the perturbedness,  no statement was given by him before the I.O., in case all the allegation made against the appellant Atul Pandey by Parch Nos. 1 and 4 are accepted even then the inference may not be drawn that he was having exclusive knowledge with regard to the murder of the deceased even in any manner his presence in the restaurant at the time of commission of the murder is not established beyond the doubt. In the present case under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_39\">sections 120-B</a> IPC because there is no evidence  available on record with regard to the hatching the conspiracy.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">\tIn any case the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta and Atul Pandey @ Babloo may not be convicted by drawing the inference of guilt under <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_40\">section 106</a> and <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_41\">114</a> Evidence Act and prosecution has failed to prove the charge against the appellant Pankaj Kumar Gupta and Atul Pandey alias Babloo.
