Appeal Nos. \n185 of 1985, Crl. Appeal No.214 of 1985, Crl. Appeal No.202 of 1985 and Crl. \nAppeal No.175 of 1985, respectively.  A learned Single Judge of the High Court \nof New Delhi, by his judgment dated 30.4.2001, while affirming the conviction \nand sentence imposed on accused No.1 and accused No.2, dismissed Crl. \nAppeal Nos. 185 and 214 of 1985 respectively filed by them.  So far as accused \nNo.3 and accused No.4 are concerned, the learned single Judge, did not choose \nto agree with the decision of the learned Trial Judge and while allowing their \nappeals set aside their conviction and sentence imposed therefor and acquitted \nthem.  Not satisfied, the Government of National Capital Territory filed SLP \nNos.3928-3929 of 2002 and after leave was granted the appeals were \nentertained as Crl. Appeal Nos.247 and 248 of 2003.  The respondent in Crl. \nAppeal No.247 of 2003 (accused No.3) was reported dead on 26.2.2003 \nresulting in the abatement of the said appeal, leaving only the appeal filed in Crl. \nAppeal No.248 of 2003 in respect of the acquittal of accused No.4 by the High \nCourt for consideration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">\tOn behalf of the appellant-State, it was contended that the reversal of the \nconviction of the respondent was under a gross misdirection on the part of the \nlearned Single Judge in the High Court and misconstruction of the scope of \n<a href=\"/doc/1946503/\" id=\"a_19\">Sections 10</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1974480/\" id=\"a_20\">30</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872.  It was also urged that the \nHigh Court in acquitting the respondent overlooked vital material firmly \nconnecting the respondent with the other conspirators resulting in grave and \nmanifest error and injustice and, therefore, this court must restore the judgment \nof the learned trial Judge, by setting aside the decision of the High Court.  It was \nfurther contended that the materials on record, so far as the respondent (accused \nNo.4) is concerned, themselves sufficiently substantiated the case against him \nand the High Court ought not to have interfered with the well merited conviction \nof the respondent.  In support thereof, our attention has been invited to the \njudgments of the courts below in great detail and to the relevant materials on \nrecord.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">\tPer contra, on behalf of the respondent (accused No.4), the learned senior \ncounsel contended that the findings of acquittal recorded in favour of the \nrespondent is based upon sound reasoning and correct understanding and \nappreciation of law and, therefore, no interference is warranted in this appeal \nfiled under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution of India.  While elaborating those \naspects, it was urged that the confession or admissions of a co-accused are not \nadmissible as substantive evidence against the others, than the maker himself \nand in the light of doubts about the manner of recovery of the defence Telephone \nDirectory (Ex.PW14/A) the acquittal was fully justified.  According to the \nrespondent, the necessary ingredients of <a href=\"/doc/64934656/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 3(I)(c)</a> of the Act have not been \nsatisfactorily proved against him and as long as the conclusions of the High \nCourt are equally reasonably possible and not found to be perverse or \nunreasonable, no interference is called for in this appeal.  The conviction of the \naccused No.4-respondent was said to have been on mere suspicion and the \ncharge under Section 120B also was said to have been not proved properly.  \nFinally, it has been urged that out of the sentence of 2 years RI imposed the \nrespondent having already served under custody 18 months and 24 days, there \nis no justification to send him back to prison and there is justification for \nconsideration of the question relating to the quantum of sentence, in favour of the \nrespondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">\tWe have carefully considered the submissions of the learned counsel \nappearing on either side.  There is no such general rule as that, this court in an \nappeal cannot interfere with the opinion of the High Court, though the scope and \nreasons for such interference may vary from cases otherwise coming by way of a \nregular appeal.  Though this Court does not convert itself into a court to review \nthe evidence for a third time by grant of special leave, where the High Court is \nshown to have completely failed in appreciating the true effect of the materials \nbrought on record and its findings are erroneous, perverse and result in \nmiscarriage of justice, the Supreme Court will have no hesitation to interfere, all \nthe more so when the High Court has chosen to reverse a verdict of conviction \nrecorded by the learned Trial Judge, under a total misconception of the principles \nof law as well as the vital and essential facts proved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1953969\" id=\"span_1\">So far as the scope of <a href=\"/doc/88046602/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 3(1) (c)</a> of the Act is concerned, it was \nurged for the respondent that unless the articles enumerated are shown to be \n&#x27;secret&#x27; document or material and that besides their collection they were \npublished or communicated to any other person, the charge under the said \nprovision could not said to have been made out.  Apparently, the inspiration for \nsuch a submission was the judgment of a learned Single Judge of the Bombay \nHigh Court reported in <a href=\"/doc/1953969/\" id=\"a_24\">State of Maharashtra vs. B.K. Subba Rao &amp; Another</a> \n(1993 Crl.L. J. 2984).  We are unable to agree with this extreme submission on \nbehalf of the respondent.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"503552\" id=\"span_2\">This Court in <a href=\"/doc/503552/\" id=\"a_25\">Sama Alana Abdulla vs. State of \nGujarat</a> [(1996) 1 SCC 427] had held: (a) that the word &#x27;secret&#x27; in clause (c) of \nsub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/64934656/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 3</a> qualified official code or password and not any \nsketch, plan, model, article or note or other document or information and (b) \nwhen the accused was found in conscious possession of the material (map – <a href=\"/doc/503552/\" id=\"a_27\">in \nthat case</a>) and no plausible explanation has been given for its possession, it has \nto be presumed as required by <a href=\"/doc/190259671/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 3(2)</a> of the Act that the same was \nobtained or collected by the appellant for a purpose prejudicial to the safety or \ninterests of the State.  Further, each one of the several acts enumerated in \nclause (c) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/64934656/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 3</a> of the Act, by themselves will constitute, \nindividually, an offending act to attract the said provision and it is not necessary \nthat only one or more of them and particularly publishing or communication of the \nsame need be conjointly proved for convicting one charged with the offence of \nobtaining or collecting records or secret official code or password or any sketch, \nplan, model, article or note or other document or information.  Any such \ninterpretation would not only amount to doing violence to the language, scheme \nunderlying and the very object of the said provision besides rendering otiose or a \ndead letter the specific provision engrafted in sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/64934656/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 3</a> of the \nAct.  In view of this, the decision of the Single Judge of the High Court in 1993 \nCrl.</span> L. J. 2984 (supra) cannot be said to lay down the correct position of law on \nthe scope of <a href=\"/doc/88046602/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 3(1)(c)</a> of the Act. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">\tThe submissions on behalf of the parties on either side on either the \nrelevance, efficacy and reliability of the confessional statements of the 1st \nAccused or principles underlying <a href=\"/doc/1946503/\" id=\"a_32\">Sections 10</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1974480/\" id=\"a_33\">30</a> of the Indian Evidence Act \n1872, next falls for consideration.  No doubt, in law the confession of a co-\naccused cannot be treated as substantive evidence to convict, other than the \nmaker of it, on the evidentiary value of it alone.  But, it has often been reiterated \nthat if on the basis of the consideration of other evidence on record the Court is \ninclined to accept the other evidence, but not prepared to act on such evidence \nalone, the confession of a co-accused can be pressed into service to fortify its \nbelief to act on it also.  Once there are sufficient materials to reasonably believe \nthat there was concert and connexion between persons charged with a common \ndesign – it is immaterial as to whether they were strangers to each other or \nignorant of the actual role of each of them or that they did not perform any one or \nmore of such acts by joint efforts in unison.  <a href=\"/doc/1974480/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 30</a> of the Indian Evidence \nAct envisages that when more than one person are being tried jointly for the \nsame offence and a confession made by one of such persons is found to affect \nthe maker and some other of such persons and stand sufficiently proved, the \nCourt can take into consideration such confession as against such other person \nas well as against the person who made such confession.  This is what exactly \nseems to have been done by the learned Trial Judge, particularly in the context \nof sufficient material available to also directly involve A-3 and A-4 in the common \ndesign of collecting materials relating to Army activities or defense secrets.  The \nlearned Judge in the High Court not only misconstrued the relevant principles of \nlaw but also is found to have gone amiss totally to the relevant and vital aspects \nof the materials and appears to have arrived at conclusions patently against \nweight of evidence, resulting in grave miscarriage of justice.  The decision in \nNatwarlal Sakarlal Mody Vs. The State of Bombay [(1961) 65 Bom. L.R. 660 \n(SC)] was in the context of the need for joint trial claimed by the State of cases \ninvolving distinct acts/offences of criminal conspiracy against several accused \nand does not even otherwise in any manner lend support to the plea made on \nbehalf of the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\tSo far as the charge under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 120-B</a>, IPC, is concerned, it stands \nproved by showing that two or more persons have agreed to do or cause to do \nan illegal act or an act which is not illegal by illegal means and that some overt \nact was done by one of the accused in pursuance of the same.  Where their \ncommon object or design is itself to do an unlawful act, the specification of such \nact itself which formed their common design would suffice and it would even be \nunnecessary or super flows to further substantiate the means adopted by all or \nany of them to achieve such object.  All the more so, when their common object \nor design appear to be to commit series of such serious crimes and proof of any \novert act in such cases also is a mere surplus age and that mere proof that they \nor some of them were concerned in the overt acts alleged would, per se, go a \nlong way to establish that there existed such agreement among them.  It is well \nknown and as observed by this Court in Baburao Bajirao Patil Vs. State of \nMahrasthra [(1971) 3 SCC 432], &quot;……indeed it is seldom – if ever – that direct  \nevidence of conspiracies can be forthcoming.   Conspiracy of the present type \nfrom its very nature must be conceived and hatched in complete secrecy, for \notherwise the whole purpose would fail.&quot;  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"331743\" id=\"span_3\">This Court further, after adverting to the \ndecisions reported in <a href=\"/doc/331743/\" id=\"a_36\">Hari Charan Kurmi and Jogia Hajam Vs. State of Bihar</a> \n[1964 (6) SCR 623] and Hanumant Vs. State of M.P.

For an offence under Section \n120-B the prosecution need not necessarily prove that \nthe perpetrators expressly agreed to do or cause to \nbe done the illegal act; the agreement may be proved \nby necessary implication.  In this case, the fact that \nthe appellants were possessing and selling explosive \nsubstances without a valid licence for a pretty long \ntime leads to the inference that they agreed to do \nand/or cause to be done the said illegal act, for, \nwithout such an agreement the act could not have \nbeen done for such a long time.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"346451\" id=\"span_6\">The learned Judge in the High Court seems to have committed grave error \nin completely overlooking such well settled principles and omitting to draw the \nnecessary and reasonable conclusions flowing from the clinching and trustworthy \nevidence produced which sufficiently proved the guilt of the respondent, as rightly \nconcluded by the learned trial Judge.  As against the elaborate consideration of \nthe roles of each one of the accused, operating as well knit group aimed at \ncollecting vital data relating to militancy affairs and defence matters pertaining to \nthe Government of India and communicating and passing on of such \ndocuments/information to the foreign U.S. Intelligent – 60 operators working at \nNew Delhi, during the period between January 1978 and November 1983, the \nconsideration by the High Court was summary and perfunctory as well.  So far as \nrespondent-A4 is concerned, the Defence Telephone Director (Ex.PW.14), a \nclassified document restricted for use, was recovered from the premises No.82, \nSunder Nagar, which admittedly was being used by A-4 for his residence and \nbusiness in running M/s Emge International.  There is sufficient evidence on \nrecord to prove that this Directory was issued to PW-14 in the year 1981 and A-3 \nused to now and then visit and use the same with the permission of PW-14, that \nthereafter it was missing from PW-14 and ultimately found in the wooden Almirah \nin the House of A-4.  That apart, PW-49 seems to have deposed that A-4 himself \nopened the wooden Almirah with a key and therefrom took out Ext.PW.14/A from \ninside.  This was found to be corroborated by the evidence of PWs-25, 57 and 56 \nas well.  The other documents, which were also recovered from the wooden \nAlmirah such as Invitation and Visiting Cards detailed in Ext.PW.25/D, were \nfound to be indicative of his contact and communion with foreign agents in India.  \nThough, the respondent would deny all such, there is no reason to doubt the \nclinching, truthful and cogent evidence of all such persons and such materials in \nthe context of his links with the other accused were found to sufficiently prove \nthat A-4 was also a party to the common design of A-1 and A-2, who stood not \nonly convicted by the Trial Court but whose conviction was also affirmed by the \nvery learned Judge in the High Court.  The decision reported in <a href=\"/doc/346451/\" id=\"a_39\">Maharaj \nPrithvisinghji Bhimsinghji Vs. State of Bombay</a> [1960 Crl. L. J. 672], as to \npossession and knowledge of existence, has no relevance or application to the \nfacts of the case, since in the present case it has been proved not only to have \nbeen recovered from the house of A-4 but it was he who opened the Almirah with \na key and made available the Directory and other Cards and invitation from out of \nit.  It is too much for the learned Judge in the High Court to expect that each one \nof them should have played identical roles and been parties to all events and \nhappenings, at all stages and times.  In such circumstances, there can be no \nimpediment for the Court to reinforce its satisfaction of guilt of A-4 by referring to \nthe confession of other co-accused as well.  It is this misdirection as to the \nrequired legal norms and extent of proof that misled the High Court in the \nultimate conclusions to be drawn.</span>  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">\tWhen so much of solid proof was available as to his possession, a \nrestricted document prohibited for the general use of others and the information \ncontained therein is not to be communicated directly or indirectly to the press or \nto any person not holding any official position in the Government for the reason \nthat it contained the names, number of fields formation and units of each \nindividual officer they being also sensitive information from the defence point of \nview of the country, no further proof is required and his possession sufficiently \nsubstantiates that he or somebody on his behalf obtained or collected it for him.  \nThe mode of consideration and method of proof in a case like this, cannot be on \nthe lines of a crime under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_40\">IPC</a> inasmuch as sub-section (2) of \n<a href=\"/doc/64934656/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/94027224/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 4</a> of the Act engrafts the statutory presumptions to be \ndrawn from the facts and that this would make all the difference in the nature of \nconsideration required in respect of offences committed under the <a href=\"/doc/61492784/\" id=\"a_43\">Official \nSecrets Act, 1923</a> and the criminal conspiracies relating to such offences, be it \npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 120-B</a>, IPC.  For all the reasons stated above, we are \nsatisfied that the Verdict of Acquittal recorded by the High Court in favour of A-4, \nby way of reversal, suffers patent error of law and perversity of approach and \nconsequently require to be set aside.  We, accordingly, set aside the judgment of \nthe High Court, so far as the acquittal of respondent A-4, by allowing Crl. Appeal \nNo.248 of 2003 and restore the judgment of learned Additional Sessions Judge, \nNew Delhi, convicting him for offences under <a href=\"/doc/88046602/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 3(1) (c)</a> of Official Secrets \nAct, 1923 and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 120-B</a>, IPC.   \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">\tSo far as the quantum of punishment is concerned, though having regard \nto the nature and character of the offences, stringent punishment is required, we \nconsider it unnecessary to send the respondent A-4 once again to suffer \nimprisonment having been set at large already and taking into account the period \nalready spent by him under custody.  Though, on behalf of the respondent it is \nclaimed that he was under custody for one year, 6 months and 24 days, keeping \nin view the sentence of two years R.I. imposed by the learned Trial Judge and \nthe fact that even as per the memo filed by the appellant-State the period spent \nalready under custody was one year, six months and 20 days, we modify the \nsentence of two years each already imposed by the Trial Court under <a href=\"/doc/88046602/\" id=\"a_47\">Section \n3(1) (c)</a> of the Official Secrets Act, 1923 and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 120-B</a>, IPC, to the sentence \nalready undergone by him.  The fine imposed remains unaltered.  Appeal \nallowed, subject to the modification of the sentence of imprisonment alone, as \nabove.                         \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n \n","numcites":22,"numcitedby":41,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":1317138,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"official secrets act ","formInput":"official%20secrets%20act%20"},{"value":"section 3 official secrets act","formInput":"section%203%20official%20secrets%20act"},{"value":"section 120b ipc","formInput":"section%20120b%20ipc"},{"value":"official secrets act, 1923","formInput":"official%20secrets%20act%2C%201923"},{"value":"section 3(c) official secrets act","formInput":"section%203%28c%29%20official%20secrets%20act"},{"value":"section 120b","formInput":"section%20120b"},{"value":"indian evidence act","formInput":"indian%20evidence%20act"},{"value":"confession","formInput":"confession"},{"value":"120b ipc","formInput":"120b%20ipc"},{"value":"section 120B,indian penal code","formInput":"section%20120B%2Cindian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"120 b ipc ","formInput":"120%20b%20ipc%20"},{"value":"section 120 b ipc","formInput":"section%20120%20b%20ipc"},{"value":"120b","formInput":"120b"},{"value":"conspiracy","formInput":"conspiracy"},{"value":"sec 120-b","formInput":"sec%20120-b"},{"value":"120b of indian penal code","formInput":"120b%20of%20indian%20penal%20code"},{"value":"illegal act","formInput":"illegal%20act"},{"value":"no overt act ","formInput":"no%20overt%20act%20"},{"value":"Sessions case ","formInput":"Sessions%20case%20"},{"value":"section 120-b in the indian penal code","formInput":"section%20120-b%20in%20the%20indian%20penal%20code"}],"cats":[{"value":"criminal-conspiracy","formInput":"tag:criminal-conspiracy"},{"value":"impact-of-confession-on-jointly-tried-offenders","formInput":"tag:impact-of-confession-on-jointly-tried-offenders"},{"value":"indian-penal-code","formInput":"tag:indian-penal-code"},{"value":"conspirators-statements-and-actions","formInput":"tag:conspirators-statements-and-actions"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
