Of the various rules guiding how a legislation has to\n                be interpreted, one established rule is that unless a contrary\n                intention appears, a legislation is presumed not to be\n                intended to have a retrospective operation. The idea behind\n                the rule is that a current law should govern current\n                activities. Law passed today cannot apply to the events of\n                the past. If we do something today, we do it keeping in\n                view the law of today and in force and not tomorrow’s\n                backward adjustment of it. Our belief in the nature of the\n                law is founded on the bedrock that every human being is\n                entitled to arrange his affairs by relying on the existing law\n                and should not find that his plans have been retrospectively\n                upset. This principle of law is known as lex prospicit non\n                respicit: law looks forward not backward. As was observed\n                in Phillips v. Eyre2, a retrospective legislation is contrary to\n                the general principle that legislation by which the conduct\n                of mankind is to be regulated when introduced for the first\n                time to deal with future acts ought not to change the\n                character of past transactions carried on upon the faith of\n                the then existing law.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41993725\" id=\"span_22\">16.
