The present appeals arise out of the common\n\njudgment and order passed by the Division Bench of the\n\nHigh Court of Judicature at Allahabad dated 18th May,\n\n2018, in Reference No.01 of 2016 and, Capital Case No.602\n\nof 2016 and Capital Case No.844 of 2016, thereby\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                              2</span>\n\n\nconfirming the judgment and order of conviction dated 2 nd\n\nJanuary, 2016 and the order of death sentence dated 11 th\n\nJanuary, 2016 awarded to original accused Nos. 1, 3 and 4\n\nby the Additional Sessions Judge, Bulandshahr. Vide the\n\nsaid impugned judgment dated 18th May, 2018, the High\n\nCourt has, however, allowed the appeal of the original\n\naccused No.2­Nazra and set aside the conviction under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_2\">34</a> of the Indian Penal Code, 1860 (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as “the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">IPC</a>”) and the death penalty awarded to\n\nher.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">2.        Being aggrieved, Criminal Appeal Nos. 434­436 of\n\n2020 are filed by Jaikam Khan (Accused No.3); Criminal\n\nAppeal Nos. 437­439 of 2020 are filed by Sajid (Accused\n\nNo.4); and Criminal Appeal Nos. 440­441 of 2020 are filed\n\nby Momin Khan (Accused No.1); whereas Criminal Appeal\n\nNo. 442 of 2020 is filed by Ali Sher Khan, the first informant\n\n(P.W.1) (hereinafter referred to as “P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan”)\n\nbeing aggrieved by the order of acquittal of original accused\n\nNo.2­Nazra.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                               3</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">3.        Appellant­Momin Khan (A­1), deceased Shaukeen\n\nKhan, P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan and Kallu Khan are the four\n\nsons of deceased Mausam Khan (father, aged about 85\n\nyears) and deceased Asgari (mother, aged about 80 years).\n\nDeceased Shanno (aged about 30 years) is the wife of\n\ndeceased Shaukeen Khan, whereas deceased Samad (aged\n\nabout 8 years) is the son of deceased Shaukeen Khan and\n\ndeceased Muskan (aged about 15 years) is the niece of\n\nP.W.1­Ali Sher Khan.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">4.        Appellant­Jaikam Khan (A­3) is the first cousin of\n\ndeceased Shaukeen Khan, appellant­Momin Khan (A­1) and\n\nP.W.1­Ali Sher Khan.      Appellant­Sajid (A­4) is the son of\n\nappellant­Jaikam Khan (A­3). Original Accused No.2­Nazra,\n\nwho was convicted by the trial Court and acquitted by the\n\nHigh Court, is the wife of appellant­Momin Khan (A­1).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">5.        It   is   the   prosecution   case   that   deceased\n\nShaukeen Khan and P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan were not in good\n\nterms with Momin Khan (A­1) and his wife Nazra (A­2).\n\nTherefore, deceased Mausam Khan (father) had separated\n\nall the brothers and allotted their respective share of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                             4</span>\n\n\nproperties.   The houses of each one of them were in one\n\ncompound. Deceased Mausam Khan (father) owned a brick­\n\nkiln. In the beginning, appellant­Momin Khan (A­1) used to\n\nrun the brick­kiln, but he did not give the money earned by\n\nhim from the brick­kiln to deceased Mausam Khan (father)\n\nand his elder brother, deceased Shaukeen Khan. Therefore,\n\ndeceased Mausam Khan (father) had dispossessed Momin\n\nKhan (A­1) from the brick­kiln.       Thereafter, deceased\n\nMausam Khan and P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan were running the\n\nbrick­kiln with the help of his brother deceased Shaukeen\n\nKhan. Jaikam Khan (A­3) and Sajid (A­4) were jealous with\n\ntheir growing business and so a case was also lodged for\n\nlaying bricks over the disputed land.    Thereafter enmity\n\narose between them, and the younger brother Momin Khan\n\n(A­1) joined the company of his uncle’s son i.e. Jaikam\n\nKhan (A­3) and Jaikam Khan (A­3)’s son Sajid (A­4).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6.        On the fateful day of the incident, i.e., 23 rd\n\nJanuary, 2014, at around 8.30 p.m., P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan\n\nand his brother­in­law, P.W.2­Jaan Mohammad, were\n\npresent at home i.e. the place of incident.   At that time,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                             5</span>\n\n\nMomin Khan (A­1) with his wife Nazra (A­2) along with\n\nJaikam Khan (A­3) and Sajid (A­4) came armed with knives\n\nand assaulted Mausam Khan (father), Asgari (mother),\n\nShaukeen Khan (brother), Shanno (sister­in­law), Samad\n\n(nephew) and Muskan (niece) and killed them brutally.\n\nP.W.1­Ali Sher Khan and his brother­in­law, P.W.2­ Jaan\n\nMohammad, somehow managed to save their lives.           On\n\nhearing the cries of the deceased and others, many villagers\n\ngathered and all four accused fled from the spot through the\n\nback­door.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">7.        Immediately after the incident, P.W.1­Ali Sher\n\nKhan and P.W.2­Jaan Mohammad went to Police Station\n\nNarora, District Bulandshahr.    On the basis of the report\n\ngiven by P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan, a First Information Report\n\n(F.I.R.) came to be registered for the offence punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 34</a> of the IPC. Upon\n\ncompletion of the investigation, a charge­sheet came to be\n\nfiled before the concerned Judicial Magistrate.   The case\n\nwas committed to the court of Sessions.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\f                              6</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">8.        The trial Judge framed charges for the offences\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_7\">34</a> of the IPC and under Sec­\n\ntion 25/4 of the Indian Arms Act, 1878 (hereinafter referred\n\nto as “the <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_8\">Arms Act</a>”). The accused pleaded not guilty and\n\nclaimed to be tried. At the conclusion of the trial, the trial\n\njudge vide judgment and order dated 2nd January, 2016\n\nconvicted all the four accused for the offence punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_10\">34</a> of the IPC and sentenced them to\n\ndeath vide order dated 11th January, 2016.

The trial judge vide the said order dated 11 th\n\nJanuary, 2016 also made a reference under Section 366(1)\n\nof the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973 (hereinafter\n\nreferred to as “Cr.P.C.”) to the High Court vide Reference\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                7</span>\n\n\nNo.1 of 2016 for confirmation of the death sentence\n\nawarded by it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">10.       Being aggrieved thereby, all the four accused pre­\n\nferred appeals before the Division Bench of the High Court.\n\nThe Division Bench of the High Court vide the impugned\n\njudgment, dismissed the appeals of appellants­ accused\n\nNos. 1, 3 and 4 and confirmed the death sentence awarded\n\nto them. However, the Division Bench of the High Court al­\n\nlowed the appeal of the accused No.2­Nazra and acquitted\n\nher of the charges under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_14\">34</a> of the IPC.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">11.       Being aggrieved thereby, Momin Khan (A­1),\n\nJaikam Khan (A­3), Sajid (A­4) and P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan are\n\nbefore this Court in the present appeals.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">12.       We     have   heard   Smt.   Nitya   Ramakrishnan,\n\nlearned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of appellant­\n\nMomin Khan (A­1) as well as acquitted original accused\n\nNo.2­Nazra, Shri Dama Seshadri Naidu, learned counsel for\n\nappellants­Jaikam Khan (A­3) and Sajid (A­4), Shri Anant\n\nAgarwal, learned counsel for appellant­ P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan\n\nand Shri Vinod Diwakar, learned Additional Advocate\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">\f                                   8</span>\n\n\nGeneral appearing on behalf of the respondent­State of\n\nUttar Pradesh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">13.          Smt.    Nitya      Ramakrishnan,   learned   Senior\n\nCounsel appearing on behalf of the appellant­Momin Khan\n\n(A­1) would submit that the entire case rests on the ocular\n\ntestimony     of    P.W.1­Ali    Sher   Khan    and   P.W.2­Jaan\n\nMohammad, who are said to have witnessed the incident\n\nfrom   the kitchen and the cattle­shed of the house\n\nrespectively. She submits that both of them are interested\n\nwitnesses.      It is submitted that the High Court has\n\ndisbelieved the evidence of these two witnesses insofar as\n\noriginal accused No.2­Nazra is concerned. She submits that\n\nwhen the ocular testimony of P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan and\n\nP.W.2­Jaan Mohammad was found to be not trustworthy\n\nand reliable by the High Court with respect to accused No.2­\n\nNazra, the High Court fell in grave error in convicting the\n\nother accused on the basis of the very same ocular evidence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">14.          Learned Senior Counsel further submits that the\n\nprosecution has placed on record three site­plans at\n\nExhibits Ka­51, Ka­52 and Ka­45. It is, however, submitted\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                             9</span>\n\n\nthat in none of the site­plans, the location of the kitchen\n\nand the bathroom (which is supposed to be adjacent to\n\ncattle­shed) has been shown. She submits that as such,\n\nthere is a serious doubt, as to whether P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan\n\nand P.W.2­ Jaan Mohammad have really witnessed the\n\nincident. She further submits that even if the prosecution\n\ncase is to be believed, immediately after the occurrence of\n\nthe incident, many villagers had assembled at the spot,\n\nhowever, though the statements of such witnesses were\n\nrecorded, the prosecution has not examined a single\n\nwitness. She, therefore, submits that an adverse inference\n\nneeds to be drawn on account of non­examination of\n\nindependent witnesses, though they were very much\n\navailable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">15.          Learned Senior Counsel further submits that\n\nboth P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan and P.W.2­Jaan Mohammad have\n\nadmitted in their evidence that they were possessing mobile\n\nphones. She submits that in normal circumstances, after\n\nsuch a dastardly incident had occurred, P.W.1­Ali Sher\n\nKhan and P.W.2­Jaan Mohammad would have informed the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                               10</span>\n\n\nPolice about it on their mobile phones. She submits that,\n\nhowever, the same has not been done by them. She further\n\nsubmits that though after recording of the statement under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C., the wife of Jaikam Khan (A­3) had filed\n\nan application for producing the Call Detail Records\n\n(hereinafter referred to as “C.D.Rs.”) of P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan\n\nand P.W.2­Jaan Mohammad, the said application was\n\nrejected by the trial judge.     She submits that if the said\n\nC.D.Rs. would have been placed on record, they would have\n\nestablished the genuineness of the prosecution’s case.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">16.       She further submits that the recovery of clothes\n\nas well as the recovery of weapons are all farcical.          She\n\nsubmits that from the materials placed on record, it is clear\n\nthat the prosecution has not come to the Court with clean\n\nhands.     It   is   submitted      that   as   per   the   Arrest\n\nMemo/Panchnama (Exhibit Ka­49), the Investigating Officer\n\n(I.O.) had received an information that accused Nos. 1, 3\n\nand 4 were standing at Rajghat Square to go somewhere. On\n\nthe basis of the said information, the I.O. reached the said\n\nsquare and found the said accused at that spot.               She\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                                  11</span>\n\n\nsubmits that according to the prosecution, at around 2.00\n\na.m. in the morning on 24 th January, 2014, the said three\n\naccused were arrested. It is submitted that it is improbable\n\nthat the accused, after committing such a heinous crime,\n\nwould remain in such a close vicinity of the place of\n\noccurrence.        She further submits that the arrest of the\n\naccused No.2­Nazra, which is shown at around 6.40 a.m., is\n\nalso farcical.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">17.         Learned Senior Counsel would further submit\n\nthat the trial court has grossly erred in convicting all the\n\nfour accused and the High Court has erred in maintaining\n\nand confirming the death sentence against the accused Nos.\n\n1, 3 and 4. She submits that in any case, neither the High\n\nCourt nor the trial Court has given any reasons justifying\n\nthe award of capital punishment. She submits that there is\n\nnot even a whisper, as to why there is no possibility of the\n\naccused being reformed or rehabilitated and as to why there\n\nis    no   other    alternative   than   to   award   the   capital\n\npunishment.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                              12</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">18.       Shri Dama Seshadri Naidu, learned counsel\n\nappearing on behalf of Jaikam Khan (A­3) and Sajid (A­4),\n\nsubmits that insofar as the said accused are concerned, the\n\nprosecution story is totally unbelievable. He submits that\n\ndeceased Mausam Khan and Zafar Khan are the sons of\n\nShakoor Khan. Jaikam Khan (A­3) is the son of Zafar Khan.\n\nHe submits that from the evidence of the prosecution\n\nwitnesses, it is clear that there was a partition amongst\n\nZafar Khan and deceased Mausam Khan long time ago. Not\n\nonly that, but there was a further partition amongst the two\n\nbranches of the family. He submits that the testimonies of\n\nthese two witnesses, i.e., P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan and P.W.2­\n\nJaan Mohammad, would reveal that there is no enmity\n\nbetween deceased Mausam Khan, deceased Shaukeen Khan\n\nand P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan on one side and Jaikam Khan (A­\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">3) and Sajid (A­4) on the other. The alleged enmity was with\n\nMomin Khan (A­1), who belonged to the branch of deceased\n\nMausam Khan. He submits that, as such, the prosecution\n\nhas utterly failed to prove any motive insofar as accused\n\nNos. 3 and 4 are concerned.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">\f                             13</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">19.       Learned counsel submits that even the evidence\n\nof P.W.2­Jaan Mohammad was not trustworthy. Perusal of\n\nhis evidence would reveal that he does not know anything\n\nabout the family holdings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">20.       Shri Naidu further submitted that the recovery of\n\nclothes and weapon is totally farcical. He submits that it is\n\ntotally impossible that the accused Nos. 3 and 4, who are\n\nnot the members of the family of Momin Khan (A­1), would\n\nkeep their bloodstained clothes at the house of Momin Khan\n\n(A­1) after committing the crime. Learned counsel further\n\nsubmits that though fingerprints were taken from the\n\nrecovered articles, the fingerprint expert’s report is not\n\nplaced on record and, therefore, an adverse inference needs\n\nto be drawn against the prosecution.       Learned counsel\n\nfurther submits that all Forensic Science Laboratory\n\n(“F.S.L.” for short) reports are marked during examination\n\nunder Section 313 Cr. P.C., which is not permissible. He\n\nsubmits that, in any case, the said reports are inconclusive.\n\nShri Naidu would further submit that since P.W.1­Ali Sher\n\nKhan and P.W.2­Jaan Mohammad are related witnesses,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                               14</span>\n\n\ntheir evidence will have to be scrutinized with greater care\n\nand circumspection and it will not be safe to pass an order\n\nof conviction on their sole testimony without there being any\n\ncorroboration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">21.         Shri Vinod Diwakar, learned Additional Advocate\n\nGeneral appearing on behalf of the respondent–State of\n\nUttar Pradesh submitted that both the trial court and the\n\nHigh Court have concurrently, on the appreciation of the\n\nevidence, convicted the accused. He submits that no error\n\ncould be noticed in the concurrent findings.      He submits\n\nthat merely because kitchen and bathroom are not shown in\n\nthe site­plans, it cannot be a ground to disbelieve the ocular\n\ntestimony    of   P.W.1­Ali   Sher   Khan   and   P.W.2­Jaan\n\nMohammad. He submitted that the evidence of these two\n\nwitnesses is corroborated by the F.I.R.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">22.         Learned counsel submitted that merely because\n\nthere are certain discrepancies in the evidence of the\n\nwitnesses, it cannot be a ground to disbelieve the ocular\n\ntestimonies of the witnesses, which are otherwise cogent,\n\nreliable and trustworthy.     He, therefore, submits that no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                              15</span>\n\n\ninterference is warranted in the appeals preferred at the\n\nbehest of accused Nos. 1, 3 and 4 and the same deserve to\n\nbe dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">23.       Shri Anant Agarwal, learned counsel appearing\n\non behalf of P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan, would submit that when\n\nthe Additional Sessions Judge on the basis of correct\n\nappreciation of evidence convicted accused No.2­Nazra,\n\nthere was no reason for the High Court to reverse the same.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">24.       The learned counsel for respective parties, while\n\nsupporting their contentions, have placed reliance on\n\nvarious decisions of this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">25.       With the assistance of the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants, we have scrutinized the entire evidence in depth.\n\nSince the conviction of the accused appellants is largely\n\nbased on the ocular testimonies of P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan and\n\nP.W.2­Jaan Mohammad, we find that it will be appropriate\n\nto reproduce relevant part of their examination­in­chief:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">          Examination­in­chief of P.W.1­Ali Sher\n          Khan\n\n          “My father had brick­klin and due to the\n          same brick­klin, the accused ­persons\n          present in court namely Jaikam Khan,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                  16</span>\n\n\nShajid, Nazra too bore enmity.

This case primarily hinges on the\n                testimony of a single eyewitness Ajoy PW\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                3. Indeed, conviction can be based on\n                the testimony of a single eyewitness and\n                there is no rule of law or evidence which\n                says to the contrary provided the sole\n                witness passes the test of reliability. So\n                long as the single eyewitness is a wholly\n                reliable witness the courts have no diffi­\n                culty in basing conviction on his testi­\n                mony alone. However, where the single\n                eyewitness is not found to be a wholly\n                reliable witness, in the sense that there\n                are some circumstances which may\n                show that he could have an interest in\n                the prosecution, then the courts gener­\n                ally insist upon some independent cor­\n                roboration of his testimony, in material\n                particulars, before recording conviction.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">                It is only when the courts find that the\n                single eyewitness is a wholly unreliable\n                witness that his testimony is discarded\n                in toto and no amount of corroboration\n                can cure that defect.

In the\n          normal course of events, a close rela­\n          tion would be the last person to\n          spare the real assailant of his uncle\n          and implicate a false person.

If the version of these two witnesses is compared\n\nwith the site­plans, then the position that emerges would\n\nreveal that P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan, at the most, could have\n\nwitnessed    the   assault   on        deceased   Shaukeen   Khan,\n\nwhereas P.W.2­Jaan Mohammad could have witnessed the\n\nassault on deceased Mausam Khan and deceased Shaukeen\n\nKhan. However, since from the perusal of the first site­plan\n\n(Exhibit Ka­51), it could be seen that the dead­bodies of\n\ndeceased Muskan, Samad, and Asgari were inside the\n\nhouse, and the dead­body of deceased Shanno Begam was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">\f                                 35</span>\n\n\nupstairs, it is difficult to believe that these two witnesses\n\ncould have also seen the accused assaulting Shanno\n\nBegam, Muskan, Asgari and Samad.             It is further to be\n\nnoted that P.W.9­Brahmesh Kumar Yadav in his cross­\n\nexamination has admitted that P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan and\n\nP.W.2­Jaan Mohammad had not told him about their\n\nhideouts and that is why it was not mentioned in the site­\n\nplan.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">45.

Generally speaking, oral\n               testimony in this context may be classi­\n               fied into three categories, namely:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                     (1) Wholly reliable.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">3 (1957) SCR 981\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                              36</span>\n\n\n                (2) Wholly unreliable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">                (3) Neither wholly reliable nor\n             wholly unreliable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">             In the first category of proof, the court\n          should have no difficulty in coming to its\n          conclusion either way — it may convict\n          or may acquit on the testimony of a sin­\n          gle witness, if it is found to be above re­\n          proach or suspicion of interestedness,\n          incompetence or subornation.

We are also of the view that\n\nthe said witnesses cannot be said to be wholly unreliable.\n\nThey would fall in the category of ‘neither wholly reliable nor\n\nwholly unreliable’ and as such, we are of the view that a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">\f                             37</span>\n\n\ngreater degree of care and caution would be required and a\n\ncorroboration in material particulars by reliable testimony,\n\ndirect or circumstantial, would be necessary to pass an\n\norder of conviction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">48.

Insofar as the arrest of accused Nos.1, 3 and 4 is\n\nconcerned, P.W.9­Brahmesh Kumar Yadav (I.O.), states\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">\f                             38</span>\n\n\nthat, on the basis of written complaint, Crime No.25 of 2014\n\ncame to be registered for the offence punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_22\">34</a> of the IPC.    He stated that thereafter, he\n\nimmediately reached at the complainant’s house along with\n\nthe force. It was crowded there. He recorded the statement\n\nof the complainant­P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan.     He stated that\n\nwhen they were at the scene of occurrence with the police\n\nforce, they received information through informer that the\n\naccused of the aforesaid case were present at Rajghat\n\nChauraha looking for a chance to go somewhere. Relying on\n\nthis information, when they reached at Rajghat Chauraha,\n\nthree persons were there in the passenger shed.         The\n\ninformer went away after showing those three men and they\n\narrested them at 2.00 a.m. in the morning of 24 th January,\n\n2014. They revealed their names as Momin Khan, Jaikam\n\nKhan and Sajid. According to him, the accused stated that\n\nthey had committed those six murders in association with\n\nNazra and all the accused told them that they had thrown\n\naway the weapons with which they had committed the crime\n\nand they could get those recovered.    His further evidence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">\f                             39</span>\n\n\nstates about the recovery of those weapons, with which we\n\nwill deal later in this judgment. He further states that when\n\nthey were returning to the police station with accused,\n\nleaving a few policemen behind at the scene of occurrence,\n\naccused No.2­Nazra, met at Rajghat Chauraha, seeing\n\nwhom Momin Khan (A­1) said that she was his wife. She\n\nwas arrested at 6.40 a.m. and everyone was presented at\n\nthe police station at 6.50 a.m. on 24th January, 2014.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_74\">50.       P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan, in his cross­examination,\n\nstates that he does not know how far the road of Rajghat is\n\nfrom his house. He further states that he cannot say even\n\nby guessing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">51.       P.W.2­Jaan Mohammad admitted in his cross­\n\nexamination that the house of deceased Mausam Khan is at\n\na distance of one furlong from Rajghat road.      He further\n\nclarified that by one furlong he means half kilometre.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">52.       It is thus difficult to believe that accused Nos. 1,\n\n3 and 4 were waiting at Rajghat square, which is at a\n\ndistance of hardly half a kilometre from the place of\n\noccurrence, waiting for the Police to come and arrest them.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">\f                               40</span>\n\n\nThe alleged informer has neither been named nor has he\n\nbeen examined. It is further difficult to believe that accused\n\nNo.2­Nazra was wandering in the village and coincidently at\n\n6.40 a.m., crossed paths with P.W.9­ Brahmesh Kumar\n\nYadav (I.O.), when he was returning to the police station\n\nalong with other accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">53.       In this respect, it will also be relevant to refer to\n\nthe testimony of P.W.2­Jaan Mohammad.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">          “When we went to the police station to get\n          the report written, Momin and Nazra, as\n          well as Jaikam and Sajid were present at\n          the police station.”\n\n          It   is   thus   clear    admission    of   P.W.2­Jaan\n\nMohammad that when he and P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan had\n\ngone to the police station to give the written report, Momin\n\nKhan (A­1), Nazra (A­2), Jaikam Khan (A­3) and Sajid (A­4)\n\nwere already present there in the police station. According\n\nto the prosecution, the crime is registered on 23 rd January,\n\n2014 at 10.00 p.m. when both P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan and\n\nP.W.2­Jaan Mohammad were present.

Insofar as the recovery of the weapons alleged to\n\nhave been used in the crime at the instance of the accused\n\nis concerned, the prosecution has relied on the arrest­cum­\n\nrecovery memo, which is at Exhibit Ka­49.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">55.       We have already dealt with this aspect in the said\n\nmemo with regard to the arrest of the accused. The relevant\n\npart of the said memo reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">          “The aforesaid three persons were asked\n          about the incident, Momeen Khan told\n          that he had dispute with his father over\n          partition. In the beginning he used to\n          run kiln, later on it was given to\n          Shaukin Khan. The means of his\n          livelihood came to an end, he was in\n          trouble. Jaikam and Sajid had enmity\n          with his brothers. Thus he took help of\n          Jaikam and Sajid and killed his parents\n          and family of Shaukin in a planned\n          manner after inflicting serious injuries\n          over their neck, head and mouth. They\n          had thrown the knives at the back of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">\f                  42</span>\n\n\nhouse and field with which they caused\nthe death. Accused told that they could\nget the weapon used in murder\nrecovered. We came to the house of\nShaukin at Village Pilkhana along with\nall the aforesaid accused in the hope of\nrecovery of weapon used. All the three\naccused live in the same compound.\nMomeen walked forward, entered the\nmiddle house where his mother used to\nsleep and took out a daav having\nwooden handle around 7 fingers and\nblade around 1 balisht 1 finger that was\nbloodstained from the rubbish beneath\nstaircase. He handed over the weapon at\naround 3 am and told that he caused\ndeath with it. Field unit is on the spot,\nphotographs were clicked. Recovery of\nweapon was made in presence of public\nwitnesses Khemkaran s/o Tara Singh,\nVilal s/o Usman Khan r/o Pilkhana.\nAnother accused Jaikam s/o Jafar Khan\nwalked forward into the field at the back\nof his house and got a knife measuring 1\nbalisht 6 fingers handle recovered in\npresence of aforesaid witnesses at\naround 3:15 o&#x27;clock and stated that he\ncaused death with the same. Its\nphotograph was clicked and fingerprint\ntaken and after sometime fingerprint\nteam went away.        After much time\naccused Sajid walked into the field\nbehind the house of Shaukin and took\nout a knife measuring 1 balisht 5\nfingers. Its blade is fitted with plastic\narc. He got it recovered and stated that\nhe caused death with it. The three\naforesaid knives were bloodstained. Thus\nblade was wrapped into a cotton, kept in\nseparate clothes, sealed and stamped on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">\f                                43</span>\n\n\n               the spot and sample seal was prepared.\n               Memo was dictated by me to H.C.P.\n               Sadar Singh in electric and torch light\n               and documents were prepared.”\n\n               Though the memo shows that the said recoveries\n\nwere made in the presence of public witnesses, no public\n\nwitness has been examined to support the same. It will be\n\nrelevant to refer to the celebrated judgment of the Privy\n\nCouncil in the case of Pulukuri Kottayya and others v.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">King Emperor4\n        “…..On normal principles of construction\n        their Lordships think that the proviso to\n        <a href=\"/doc/1814769/\" id=\"a_23\">S. 26</a>, added by<a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_24\"> s. 27</a>, should not be held\n        to nullify the substance of the section.

As already discussed hereinabove, since no\n\npublic witness has been examined to support the said\n\nmemo, the statement made therein will have to be\n\nscrutinised with greater caution and circumspection.      All\n\nthe statements made therein with regard to the confession\n\nof committing the crime would not be admissible in\n\nevidence.    Only such information, which distinctly relates\n\nto the discovery of facts will be admissible under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 27</a>\n\nof the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (hereinafter referred to as\n\n‘the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_26\">Evidence Act</a>”).      The evidence of P.W.9­Brahmesh\n\nKumar Yadav (I.O.) would reveal that immediately after the\n\nF.I.R. was lodged, he had come to the spot of incident for\n\nfurther investigation. According to him, the accused Nos. 1,\n\n3 and 4 were arrested at around 2.00 a.m. on 24 th January,\n\n2014.   Even according to him, the police party was very\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">\f                                 45</span>\n\n\nmuch there at the spot.       One of the alleged recoveries is\n\nfrom the room where deceased Asgari used to sleep. The\n\nother two recoveries are from open field, just behind the\n\nhouse of deceased Shaukeen Khan, i.e., the place of\n\nincident.     It could thus be seen that the recoveries were\n\nmade from the places, which were accessible to one and all\n\nand as such, no reliance could be placed on such\n\nrecoveries.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">C.    Recovery of the bloodstained clothes alleged to\n\n      have been worn by the accused while committing\n\n      the crime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_84\">57.         The    recovery   memo         of   bloodstained   clothes\n\n(Exhibit Ka­34) also makes for an interesting reading.\n\nPerusal of the aforesaid memo shows that the police party\n\nalong with three sons and two daughters of the accused\n\nNo.1­Momin Khan and accused No.2­Nazra came to the\n\nhouse of the accused No.1­Momin Khan.                 At that place,\n\nHina @ Yasmeen, daughter of accused No.1­Momin Khan\n\nand   accused      No.2­Nazra,        in    the   presence     of   her\n\ngrandparents, viz., Akhlaq and Shakila and neighbours\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">\f                              46</span>\n\n\nJabbar and Kishan Chandra and other villagers unlocked\n\nher house and took out her things. At that time, Maumin\n\nsaw some clothes under the bed in the room. On seeing the\n\nclothes, many villagers identified and told that the clothes\n\nwere the same which Momin Khan (A­1) and others had\n\nworn in the evening of 23rd January, 2014. The clothes were\n\nidentified separately, in which Momin Khan (A­1) was\n\nwearing jeans of blue colour and blue shirt having black\n\nand white squares, Jaikam Khan (A­3) was wearing kurta of\n\ncream colour and printed readymade sweater of brown\n\ncolour, Sajid (A­4) was wearing pants of light black colour\n\nand printed shirt of light yellow, red black colour and Nazra\n\n(A­2) was wearing printed salwar kurta of light red colour.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">58.       As per the prosecution witnesses, the accused\n\nhad run away from the rear gate of the compound, which is\n\ntowards north. As per the evidence of P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan,\n\nthe house of Momin Khan (A­1) is at a distance of 10­15\n\nsteps away from the place of the incident. According to the\n\nprosecution   witnesses,   immediately   after   the   incident\n\noccurred, many villagers had gathered at the spot. In these\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">\f                                47</span>\n\n\ncircumstances, it is again a mystery as to how all the four\n\naccused fled from the spot, came back at the said spot,\n\nchanged their clothes and again went away. It is also a\n\nmystery as to how the accused Nos. 3 and 4, who are not\n\nresiding in Momin Khan’s (A­1) house, had changed their\n\nclothes and kept them at Momin Khan’s (A­1) house. This\n\ncoupled    with   the   fact   that   the     F.S.L.   reports   are\n\ninconclusive, creates a great shadow of doubt on the\n\ngenuineness of the said recovery.           In any case, the said\n\nclothes are not recovered on the memorandum of the\n\naccused under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act and as such,\n\nthe said circumstance could not have been used against the\n\naccused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">D.         Motive\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">59.        No doubt that, in case of direct evidence and the\n\nocular testimony of the eye­witness being found to be\n\ntrustworthy, reliable and cogent, it will not be necessary for\n\nthe prosecution to prove the motive for the crime. However,\n\nin the present case, as we have already held hereinabove,\n\nthat the testimony of the eye­witnesses could not be said to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">\f                              48</span>\n\n\nbe wholly reliable, the motive aspect would be a relevant\n\nfactor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_88\">60.       As per the prosecution version, the main motive\n\nbehind the crime was with regard to the dispute over the\n\nmanagement of the brick­kiln between the accused No.1­\n\nMomin Khan on one hand and deceased Mausam Khan,\n\ndeceased Shaukeen Khan and P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan on the\n\nother hand. In the F.I.R., P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan has stated\n\nthat the accused Nos. 3 and 4 were jealous with his\n\nbusiness and a case was also lodged for laying bricks over\n\nthe land. It is further stated that since then, enmity grew\n\nbetween the family and younger brother Momin Khan (A­1)\n\njoined the company of his uncle’s son Jaikam Khan (A­3)\n\nand Jaikam Khan’s (A­3) son Sajid (A­4). No doubt, that the\n\nF.I.R. is not a substantive piece of evidence, however, it will\n\nbe relevant for scrutinising the credibility of the first\n\ninformant.    Though in his cross­examination, P.W.1­Ali\n\nSher Khan has stated that Momin Khan (A­1) had a rift with\n\nhim, the reason for Momin Khan’s (A­1) rift with his parents\n\nand brothers was, due to him not giving an account of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">\f                                   49</span>\n\n\nmoney earned from brick­kiln to them.                   He has further\n\nstated that his father, deceased Mausam Khan, had relieved\n\nMomin Khan (A­1) from the duty of brick­kiln in 2010 and\n\nsince then Momin Khan (A­1) bore enmity against him. He\n\nhas further stated that due to the same brick­kiln, accused\n\nNos. 2, 3 and 4, viz., Nazra, Jaikam Khan and Sajid\n\nrespectively, too bore enmity against him.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">61.       In his cross­examination, P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan\n\nhas clearly admitted that it is Momin Khan and family who\n\nhad dispute with him over the property of brick­kiln. The\n\nsaid dispute was over details of accounts. He has admitted\n\nthat accused Nos. 3 and 4 had nothing to do with regard to\n\nbrick­kiln of his father deceased Mausam Khan. It will be\n\nrelevant to refer to the original hindi version of the evidence\n\nof P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan, which is as under:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">          “यह बबात सहह हह कह जयकम व सबाजजद कबा ममेरमे जपितबा ममौसम\n          खबान समे भट्टबा कमे लमेनमे कबा नहह ह थबा|”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_90\">62.       P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan has categorically admitted in\n\nhis cross­examination that the shares in the agricultural\n\nland between his father deceased Mausam Khan and Zafar\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">\f                                50</span>\n\n\nKhan, father of Jaikam Khan (A­3), were separate. He has\n\nfurther admitted that the names of Zafar Khan and his four\n\nsons have been entered in the records and he has seen that\n\nKhatauni was recorded in the name of Zafar’s sons, Jaikam\n\nKhan and Yameen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">63.

It is also correct that Jaikam\n            Khan      and    Sajid   Khan   had   no\n            partnership in the Kiln of Mausam Khan\n            and Alisher.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_92\">64.         It could thus be seen that the alleged motive, if\n\nany, is attributable to the accused No.1­Momin Khan.\n\nP.W.1­Ali Sher Khan and P.W.2­Jaan Mohammad have\n\nadmitted that Jaikam Khan (A­3) and Sajid (A­4) had\n\nnothing to do with the brick­kiln business of deceased\n\nMausam Khan. They have further admitted that there was\n\nno dispute with regard to brick­kiln amongst his father\n\ndeceased Mausam Khan on one hand and accused Nos. 3\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">\f                             51</span>\n\n\nand 4 on the other hand. It is further to be noted that even\n\naccording to P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan, the dispute between his\n\nfather deceased Mausam Khan and accused No.1­Momin\n\nKhan with regard to brick­kiln took place in the year 2010.\n\nThough    P.W.1­Ali   Sher   Khan   states   in     his   cross­\n\nexamination that heated exchanges regarding brick­kiln\n\ntook place between Momin Khan (A­1) and his father\n\ndeceased Mausam Khan, during last 3­4 years, no incident,\n\nwhich would cause provocation to lead to such dastardly\n\nact, has been brought on record.       On the contrary, he\n\nadmitted in his cross­examination that though quarrel took\n\nplace between his father deceased Mausam Khan and\n\nMomin Khan (A­1), no quarrel took place between Momin\n\nKhan (A­1), deceased Shaukeen Khan and himself.              He\n\nfurther admitted that decisions were taken through the\n\nrelatives but Momin Khan (A­1) did not accept it.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_93\">65.       It could thus be seen that with regard to Jaikam\n\nKhan (A­3) and Sajid (A­4), the prosecution has utterly\n\nfailed to prove any motive and has also failed to prove any\n\nstrong motive insofar as Momin Khan (A­1) is concerned.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">\f                                   52</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\">66.             The matter does not end at this.

According to P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan and P.W.2­\n\nJaan Mohammad, a large number of villagers had gathered\n\nat the spot after the incident.            However, none of the\n\nindependent          witnesses   have    been   examined    by   the\n\nprosecution. Since the witnesses examined on behalf of the\n\nprosecution are interested witnesses, non­examination of\n\nindependent witnesses, though available, would make the\n\nprosecution version doubtful.            Reference in this respect\n\ncould be placed on the following observations of this Court\n\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/662142/\" id=\"a_28\">State of Rajasthan v.

Apart from that, it could be seen that, though it is\n\nthe assertion of P.W.1­Ali Sher Khan and P.W.2­Jaan\n\nMohammad that they together had gone to the police station\n\nto lodge the report, the same has been contradicted by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">\f                                54</span>\n\n\nevidence of P.W.4­Manveer Singh, who was the Constable\n\nClerk at the police station.

The\nabove recovery also indicates to this fact\nthat the entire episode of the murders\nwas a pre­planned one and that a\ncomprehensive strategy was chalked out\nfor it. All the accused gathered at the\nhouse of the accused Momin prior to\ncommitting the murders. They already\nknew that on committing murders by\nsharp weapons, the splashes of blood\nwould hurl at their clothes because of\nwhich, if they don’t change their clothes,\nthey would be not be able to hide their\ncrime during being absconded. That is\nwhy, they had already managed\nadditional clothes for them in the house\nof the accused Momin. After committing\nthe crime, they as per the planning, went\nto Momin’s house, changed their clothes\nand ran away. Opening the lock of their\nhome by sons and daughters of Momin\non the third day of the occurrence also\nindicates that either Momin’s all sons\nand daughters were at home at the time\nof the occurrence and they left from the\nhouse with the accused after the\noccurrence or Momin’s and Nazra’s kids\nwere not at all present there in the\nhouse at the time of occurrence and that\nall the kids were sent to their grand­\nparent’s house prior to the occurrence.\nSince the crime was committed in a well\nand pre – planned way, it seems more\nprobable that the kids were sent to their\ngrand­parent’s home prior to the\noccurrence. If this probability is\naccepted, the arrest of the accused\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">\f                             58</span>\n\n\n          Nazra after the occurrence, and the\n          arrest of the remaining three accused viz\n          Momin, Sajid and Jaikam at the Rajghat\n          Chauraha at 2.00 ‘O’ clock at night not\n          taking place but in the morning at 6.30\n          ‘O’ clock becomes important.

All the accused may have\n          planned to gather at the same Chauraha\n          and run away together from here and\n          that is why, they kept on waiting for\n          Nazra at the same place till 2.00 o’ Clock\n          at night. It is impossible because of this\n          reason also that if the occurrence took\n          place around 8.30 pm, the three accused\n          Momin, Zaikam and Sajid had sufficient\n          time after perpetrating this crime, to run\n          away very far.

The presence,\n          therefore, of the three assailants Momin,\n          Jaikam and Sajid cannot be ruled out as\n          there is no doubt that such nature of\n          assault in the natural course of things\n          would be carried out by more than one\n          person.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_112\">79.       Another finding of the High Court, which makes\n\nfor an interesting reading and is foreign to criminal\n\njurisprudence is thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">          “The question of motive in relation to\n          Jaikam and Sajid may not be immediate\n          and they being a separate family may be\n          correct. This however by itself may not\n          be sufficient to dilute the connection of\n          Sajid and Jaikam with Momin. However\n          on this count, we find that the trial court\n          has raised a presumption about jealousy\n          amongst the families on account of\n          Mausam Khan having developed his\n          business and augmented his earnings\n          through a brick klin. This part of the\n          discussion of the trial court does not\n          find sufficient corroboration from the\n          evidence on record, and therefore, the\n          motive appears to be remote and not a\n          very strong motive. This, however, does\n          not mean to say that there was no\n          connection with Jaikam and Sajid with\n          Momin, who did appear to be on friendly\n          terms and this fact is reflected from the\n          statement of the witnesses particularly,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">\f                            62</span>\n\n\n         PW­1 and PW­2, where they have\n         indicated an attitude of vengeance being\n         present for certain reasons. Thus even\n         though a strong motive may not have\n         been established and the reasonings of\n         the trial court may be a little stretched,\n         yet the same would not wipe out their\n         presence particularly when the ocular\n         testimony to establish their presence\n         when the offence was committed.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_113\">80.      Further, it can be seen that, the very same\n\nJudges of the High Court refused to believe the very same\n\nevidence of prosecution witnesses in respect of accused\n\nNo.2­Nazra. The High Court observed thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">         “The arrest of Smt. Nazra has been\n         shown from a public place in the\n         morning at about 6.40 am whereas Smt.\n         Nazra claims to be present at the police\n         station with her children. There is no\n         independent witness of her arrest. On\n         cross­examination,         PW­9       the\n         investigating officer has stated that he\n         does not remember as to whether Smt.\n         Nazra was at the police station with her\n         children or not. He however denies her\n         arrest at the police station. PW­2 in his\n         cross­examination on 20.03.2015 has\n         stated that when he went to the police\n         station    for  lodging    of  the   first\n         information report, then Momin, Jaikab,\n         Sajid and Nazra were all present at the\n         police station. This testimony of PW­2\n         corroborates his presence at the police\n         station with PW­1 informant who has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">\f                             63</span>\n\n\n          admitted having gone to the police\n          station with his brother­in­law PW­2.\n          The story of arrest of Nazra at 6:40 am\n          the next day morning in these\n          circumstances as set up by the\n          prosecution is therefore clearly doubtful.\n          This aspect further adds to the doubts\n          expressed above.”\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_114\">81.       We ask a question to ourselves, if the arrest of\n\nthe accused No.2­Nazra was from a public place, was the\n\narrest of the accused Nos. 1, 3 and 4 from any other place\n\nthan the place from where the accused No.2­Nazra was\n\napprehended.   If according to the High Court, there is no\n\nindependent witness of her arrest, is there any independent\n\nwitness for arrest of accused Nos. 1, 3 and 4.     If on the\n\nbasis of evidence of P.W.2­Jaan Mohammad, who has\n\ndeposed in his cross­examination, that, when he went to the\n\npolice station for lodging the F.I.R., he found Momin Khan\n\n(A­1), Jaikam Khan (A­3), Sajid (A­4) and Nazra (A­2)\n\npresent in the police station, which, according to the High\n\nCourt, is corroborated by the testimony of P.W.1­Ali Sher\n\nKhan and, therefore, the story of arrest of Nazra (A­2) at\n\n6.40 a.m. was found to be unbelievable, then how was it\n\ndifferent from the arrest of accused Nos. 1, 3 and 4, which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">\f                                       64</span>\n\n\nwas shown to be at 2.00 a.m. on 24 th January, 2016, i.e.,\n\nmuch after the time of lodging the F.I.R.                    The High Court\n\nfurther goes on to have an academic discussion with regard\n\nto the possibility, preponderance of probability, a scientist\n\nconducting his experiments with great care, choosing\n\nbetween two or more possibilities, and preponderates of one\n\nover the other, etc. The law, however, that is fully settled, is\n\nthat, it is the duty of the prosecution to prove the case\n\nbeyond reasonable doubt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8337733\" id=\"span_70\">82.
