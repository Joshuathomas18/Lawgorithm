This batch of matters is listed pursuant to  various  orders  of  this\nCourt opining that these matters are required to be considered by  a  larger\nBench.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">3.    The first of such orders is dated 20th April, 2007  made  in  Criminal\nAppeal No.644 of 2007.   By the said order, leave was granted in SLP  (Crl.)\nNo.4976 of 2006.  The order reads as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1742083\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1026836\" id=\"span_2\">“Our attention has been invited by the learned counsel to two  decisions  of\nthis Court; namely, a decision of 3-Judge Bench  in  <a href=\"/doc/1026836/\" id=\"a_1\">Collector  of  Customs,\nNew Delhi vs. Ahmadalieva Nodira</a> (2004) 3 SCC 549  and  subsequent  decision\nof 2-Judge Bench in <a href=\"/doc/1742083/\" id=\"a_2\">State of Uttaranchal vs. Rajesh  Kuamr  Gupta</a>  (2007)  1\nSCC 355.</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">Reference  was  also  made  of  <a href=\"/doc/1103105/\" id=\"a_3\">Section  80</a>  of  the  Narcotic   Drugs   and\nPsychotropic Substances Act, 1985 which reads as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">“80.  <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_4\">Application of the Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940</a> not  barred.   –  The\nprovisions of this Act or the rules made thereunder  shall  be  in  addition\nto, and not in derogation of, the <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_5\">Drugs  and  Cosmetics  Act,  1940</a>  (23  of\n1940) or the rules made thereunder.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">In our opinion, in view of the fact that the effect of Section  80  requires\nto be considered, we grant leave  and  direct  the  Registry  to  place  the\npapers before the Hon’ble  the  Chief  Justice  for   placing   the   matter\nbefore  a 3-Judge Bench.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">4.    Each of the remaining matters came to be tagged on to Criminal  Appeal\nNo. 644 of 2007 on the ground that the  issue  involved  in  each  of  these\ncases is identical with the issue involved in Criminal  Appeal  No.  644  of\n2007.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">5.    All these cases pertain to prosecution under  the  provisions  of  the\n<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_6\">Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic Substances Act, 1985</a>  (hereinafter  referred\nto as “the Act”). Each one of the accused is alleged to be in possession  of\nsome  psychotropic  substance  mentioned  in  the  <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_7\">Schedule  to   the   Act</a>.\nEventually, the  question  is  whether  persons  accused  of  committing  an\noffence under the Act could be enlarged on bail in view of the  stipulations\ncontained under <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 37</a> of the Act.  In some of  these  cases,  bail  was\ngranted by the concerned High Court and in some cases,  bail  was  rejected.\nAggrieved by such orders, either the State or the  accused  preferred  these\nappeals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">6.    <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 37</a>[1] of the Act stipulates that all the  offences  punishable\nunder the Act shall be cognizable.   It further stipulates that:—\n(1)   persons accused of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 19</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_11\">24</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/935721/\" id=\"a_12\">27A</a>  or  persons\naccused of offences  involved  in  “commercial  quantity”[2]  shall  not  be\nreleased on bail, unless the public prosecutor is given  an  opportunity  to\noppose the application for bail; and\n\n(2)   more importantly that unless “the Court is satisfied  that  there  are\nreasonable grounds for believing” that the accused is not guilty of such  an\noffence.   Further, the Court is also required to be satisfied that  such  a\nperson is not likely to commit any offence while on bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">In other words, <a href=\"/doc/496325/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 37</a> departs from the long  established  principle  of\npresumption of innocence  in  favour  of  an  accused  person  until  proved\notherwise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">7.    To understand the exact legal quandary involved in  these  matters,  a\nbrief  survey  of  the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Act   and   also   an\nunderstanding  of  the  scheme  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_14\">Drugs  and  Cosmetics   Act,   1940</a>\n(hereinafter referred to as “the 1940 Act”) is necessary.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">8.    Prior to the Act, three colonial enactments to some extent dealt  with\nthe legislative subject matter of the Act.   They are Opium Act,  1857,  <a href=\"/doc/72261612/\" id=\"a_15\">The\nOpium Act, 1878</a> and the Dangerous Drugs Act,  1930.   Subsequently,  various\ninternational treaties  and  protocols  etc.  dealing  with  the  menace  of\nnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances came into existence.   India  has\nbeen a party to those treaties  and  protocols  etc.  and  incurred  several\nlegal  obligations  thereunder.  Parliament   opined   that   the   existing\nenactments were inadequate to handle the hazard projected  by  the  narcotic\ndrugs  and  psychotropic  substances,  apart  from  the  inadequacy  of  the\nexisting law  to  enable  India  to  comply  with  its  international  legal\nobligations.  Hence, the Act and all the three old Acts were repealed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">9.    <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_16\">The Act</a> deals with narcotic drugs and psychotropic substances.    Both\nthe  expressions  are  defined  under  the  Act.    <a href=\"/doc/1777979/\" id=\"a_17\">Section  2(xiv)</a>  defines\n“narcotic drug” as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">““narcotic drug” means coca leaf, cannabis (hemp), opium,  poppy  straw  and\nincludes all manufactured goods;”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">10.    The  words  “coca  leaf”,  “cannabis”,  “opium”,  and  “poppy  straw”\noccurring in the definition of narcotic drug are  themselves  defined  under\n<a href=\"/doc/1777979/\" id=\"a_18\">Sections 2 (vi)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1777979/\" id=\"a_19\">2(iii)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1777979/\" id=\"a_20\">2(xv)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1777979/\" id=\"a_21\">2(xviii)</a> respectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">11.   <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 8</a> prohibits the cultivation by any person of any  coca  plant,\nopium poppy or cannabis plant  and  also  prohibits  the  gathering  of  any\nportion of  coca  plant.   It  further  stipulates  that  “no  person  shall\nproduce, manufacture, possess, sell, purchase,  transport,  warehouse,  use,\nconsume” or indulge in either inter-state trade or international trade  (all\nthese  prohibited  activities  hereinafter  collectively  referred   to   as\n“DEALING IN”) of any narcotic drug  or  psychotropic  substance.  <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_23\">Section  8</a>\nitself contains certain exceptions to the general prohibition  as  described\nabove.[3]  The details would be examined later.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">12.   <a href=\"/doc/941534/\" id=\"a_24\">Sections 9</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1684205/\" id=\"a_25\">10</a> authorise the Central Government and  the  concerned\nState Governments to  make  Rules  permitting  and  regulating  the  various\naspects of prohibition contained under <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 8</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">13.   <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_27\">Chapter IV of the Act</a> contains various offences  and  the  punishments\nfor the said offences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">14.   Since all the  cases  on  hand  are  cases  of  prosecution  for  some\ncontravention of the Act in relation to  psychotropic  substances,  <a href=\"/doc/1839440/\" id=\"a_28\">Sections\n22</a> to <a href=\"/doc/1641034/\" id=\"a_29\">24</a> are relevant for our enquiry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">15.   <a href=\"/doc/1839440/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 22</a>[4] prescribes the punishments for the violation of  various\nactivities prohibited under <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 8(c)</a>.  Depending upon  the  quantity  of\nthe psychotropic substance involved in the case, the  punishment  prescribed\nalso varies. If the  quantity  is  small,  the  punishment  extends  upto  6\nmonths.   The  expression  “small  quantity”  is   defined   under   <a href=\"/doc/1777979/\" id=\"a_32\">Section\n2(xxiiia)</a>[5].  If  the  quantity  is  less  than  “commercial  quantity”  as\ndefined under <a href=\"/doc/1777979/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 2(viia)</a>, but greater  than  the  small  quantity,  the\npunishment may extend upto 10 years  of  rigorous  imprisonment  apart  from\nfine. When the quantity exceeds  the  commercial  quantity,  the  punishment\nextends upto 20 years and carries a  fine  upto  2  lakhs  and  for  special\nreasons even more.   <a href=\"/doc/1395123/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 23</a>[6] prescribes  the  punishment  for  illegal\nimport to India or export out of India of narcotic  drugs  and  psychotropic\nsubstance. Once again, the punishment varies depending upon the quantity  of\nthe contraband involved in  the  offence.    Examination  of  the  scope  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1641034/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 24</a> is not necessary in the context of the  factual  setting  of  the\ncases at hand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">16.   <a href=\"/doc/649090/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 35</a> stipulates that in any prosecution  for  an  offence  under\nthe Act which requires a culpable mental state of  the  accused,  the  court\ntrying offence is mandated to assume the existence  of  such  mental  state,\nthough it is open for the accused to  prove  that  he  had  no  such  mental\nstate.[7]\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1026836\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"79810\" id=\"span_4\">17.   The ambit and scope of <a href=\"/doc/501105/\" id=\"a_37\">section 37</a> was considered by this court in  two\nearlier decisions in <a href=\"/doc/79810/\" id=\"a_38\">Union of India v. Thamisharasi</a>, (<a href=\"/doc/1026836/\" id=\"a_39\">1995) 4  SCC  190  and\nCollector of Customs, New Delhi v. Ahmadalieva Nodira</a>,  (2004)  3  SCC  549.\nThe latter of the two judgments after taking note of  the  earlier  decision\nexplained the context of <a href=\"/doc/501105/\" id=\"a_40\">section 37</a> as follows:</span></span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10854990\" id=\"span_5\">“6. As observed by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/10854990/\" id=\"a_41\">Union of India v. Thamisharasi</a>  clause  (b)\nof sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/501105/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 37</a> imposes limitations on granting of bail  in\naddition to those provided under the Code. The two limitations are:  (1)  an\nopportunity to the Public Prosecutor to oppose  the  bail  application,  and\n(2) satisfaction  of  the  court  that  there  are  reasonable  grounds  for\nbelieving that the accused is not guilty of such offence and that he is  not\nlikely to commit any offence while on bail.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">7. The limitations on granting of bail come in only  when  the  question  of\ngranting bail arises on merits. Apart from the grant of opportunity  to  the\nPublic Prosecutor, the other twin conditions which really have relevance  so\nfar as the present accused-respondent is concerned,  are:  the  satisfaction\nof the court that there  are  reasonable  grounds  for  believing  that  the\naccused is not guilty of the alleged offence and that he is  not  likely  to\ncommit any offence while on bail. The  conditions  are  cumulative  and  not\nalternative. The satisfaction contemplated regarding the accused  being  not\nguilty has to be based on reasonable  grounds.  The  expression  “reasonable\ngrounds” means something more than  prima  facie  grounds.  It  contemplates\nsubstantial probable causes for believing that the accused is not guilty  of\nthe alleged offence…”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">18.   Various sets of Rules were  framed  by  the  Government  of  India  in\nexercise of the power  conferred  under  <a href=\"/doc/941534/\" id=\"a_43\">Sections  9</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_44\">76</a>  of  the  Act.\nRelevant  for  the  purpose  of  our  enquiry  is  the  Narcotic  Drugs  and\nPsychotropic Substances Rules, 1985 (hereinafter referred to  as  “the  1985\nRules”).  Various Chapters and Rules provide  for  various  aspects  of  the\ncontrol and  regulation  of  DEALING  IN  narcotic  drugs  and  psychotropic\nsubstances.  The subject matter of Chapter III of the Rules is  opium  poppy\ncultivation  and  production  of  opium  and   poppy   straw,   Chapter   IV\nmanufacture, sale and export of opium,   Chapter  V  manufactured  drugs[8],\nChapter  VI  import,  export  and  transshipment  of  narcotic   drugs   and\npsychotropic substances into or out of India.   Rule  53  thereof  prohibits\nboth import  and  export  into  or  out  of  India  of  narcotic  drugs  and\npsychotropic substances specified in Schedule I to  the  Rules,  subject  of\ncourse to the provisions of Chapter VIIA.  Rule 53A prohibits export of  the\nnarcotic drug or psychotropic substance etc.  specified  in  Schedule-II  to\nthe Rules to certain countries or to the regions specified in the  Schedule.\n The further details of the chapter are not necessary for our purpose.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">19.   The subject matter of Chapter VII is  psychotropic  substances.   Rule\n64 prohibits each of the activities specified  under  <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_45\">Section  8(c)</a>  of  the\nAct, DEALING IN all the psychotropic substances specified in  Schedule-I  of\nthe Rules.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">Rule 64 -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">“No  person  shall  manufacture,  possess,  transport,  import  inter-State,\nexport inter-State, sell, purchase, consume or use any of  the  psychotropic\nsubstances specified in Schedule-I.”\n\nIn other words, Rule 64 reiterates the prohibition contained  under  <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_46\">Section\n8(c)</a> of the Act, w.r.t. some of the  psychotropic  substances  mentioned  in\n<a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_47\">Schedule-I to the Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">20.   Whereas Rule 65 stipulates that with  reference  to  the  psychotropic\nsubstances other than those specified in Schedule-I to the  Rules  could  be\nmanufactured subject to the limitation specified under Rule  65.   In  other\nwords, notwithstanding the  prohibition  under  <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_48\">Section  8(c)</a>,  the  Central\nGovernment in exercise of its power under <a href=\"/doc/941534/\" id=\"a_49\">Section  9(1)(a)(vi)</a>  permits  the\nmanufacture  of  those  psychotropic  substances  other  than  specified  in\nSchedule-I to the Rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">Rule 65A stipulates that-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">“No person shall possess sell, purchase, consume  or  use  any  psychotropic\nsubstance except in accordance with the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules, 1945”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">Obviously,  the  said  Rule  has  application  only  to   the   psychotropic\nsubstances other than those specified in Schedule-I of the Rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">Rule 66 mandates that-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">“no person shall possess any psychotropic substance for any of the  purposes\ncovered by the 1945 Rules, unless he is lawfully authorized to possess  such\nsubstance for any of the said purposes under these rules.”\n\nThe reference to the 1945 Rules admittedly is to  the  Drugs  and  Cosmetics\nRules, 1945 (hereinafter referred to  as  “1945  Rules”)  framed  under  the\n<a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_50\">Drugs and Cosmetics Act, 1940</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">21.   It is submitted by  Ms.  Pinky  Anand,  learned  Additional  Solicitor\nGeneral that the High Court of Bombay following two earlier decisions,  (one\nof the Delhi High Court and another of the High Court of Punjab &amp;  Haryana),\nin its judgment, which is impugned in  Special  Leave  Petition  No.5714  of\n2006, held thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">“38.  So given, as far as psychotropic substances is the  present  case  are\nconcerned, operations pertaining to them are permitted  because  Schedule  I\nto the Rules do  not  include  them  at  all.   That  these  substances  are\nincluded in the schedule to the act is not of any relevance because one  has\nto see everything viz.,  the  Act,  the  Rules  and  Order  made  thereunder\ntogether  and  in  a  harmonious  manner.   It  is  well  settled  that  the\npsychotropic substance is included in the <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_51\">Schedule to the Act</a> but it is  not\nincluded in the Schedule I to the Rules, then operations covered by  <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_52\">Section\n8</a> cannot be said to be contravening provisions of the  Act  and,  therefore,\npunishable.  That is how, these provisions have been  interpreted  by  Delhi\nHigh Court and earlier by Punjab and Haryana High Court.  Their  views  have\nmy respectful concurrence.”\n\nThe learned ASG submitted that such a conclusion is  wholly  unwarranted  on\nthe face of clear language of <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 8(c)</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_33\">22.

Tulsi, learned senior counsel appearing for  some  of  the\naccused in this batch of matters submitted that possession  of  psychotropic\nsubstance pursuant to some authorisation under the 1940 Act  or  Rules  made\nthereunder coupled with the absence of mention of a particular  psychotropic\nsubstance (found in the possession of  an  accused)  in  Schedule-I  to  the\nRules framed under the Act excludes the application of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">23.   It is in the background of the above submissions, the legality of  the\nconclusion recorded by the Bombay High Court that the absence of mention  of\na particular psychotropic substance in Schedule-I to the Rules excludes  the\napplication of <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 8</a>, notwithstanding the  fact  that  such  a  drug  is\nincluded in the <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_55\">Schedule to the Act</a>, is required to be decided.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">24.   Before we examine the correctness of various submissions, we  deem  it\nappropriate to analyze and find out the true  scope  and  ambit  of  <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_56\">section\n8(c)</a>.  <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 8(c)</a> in no uncertain  terms  prohibits  the  DEALING  IN  any\nmanner  in  any  narcotic  drug  or  psychotropic  substance.   However,  an\nexception to such prohibition is also contained in the said Section.\n“<a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 8</a>.  Prohibition of certain operations – No person shall –\nxxx                     xxx            xxx                  xxx\n\nExcept for medical or scientific purposes and  in  the  manner  and  to  the\nextent provided by the provisions of this Act or the rules  or  orders  made\nthereunder and in a case where any such provision, imposes  any  requirement\nby way of licence, permit or  authorisation  also  in  accordance  with  the\nterms and conditions of such licence, permit or authorisation;”\n\n\nThe exception being that  DEALING  IN  any  narcotic  drug  or  psychotropic\nsubstance is permitted “in the manner and to  the  extent  provided  by  the\nprovisions of this Act or the rules or orders made thereunder”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">25.   In other words, DEALING IN narcotic drugs and psychotropic  substances\nis permissible only when such DEALING is for medical purposes or  scientific\npurposes.  Further, the mere fact that the DEALING  IN  narcotic  drugs  and\npsychotropic substances is for a medical or scientific purpose does  not  by\nitself lift the embargo created under <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_59\">section 8(c)</a>.  Such a dealing must  be\nin the manner and extent provided by the provisions of  the  Act,  Rules  or\nOrders made thereunder.  <a href=\"/doc/941534/\" id=\"a_60\">Sections 9</a>[9] and 10[10]  enable  the  Central  and\nthe State Governments respectively to make rules permitting  and  regulating\nvarious aspects (contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 8(c)</a>,  of  DEALING  IN  narcotic\ndrugs and psychotropic substances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">26.   <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_62\">The Act</a> does not contemplate framing  of  rules  for  prohibiting  the\nvarious  activities  of  DEALING  IN   narcotic   drugs   and   psychotropic\nsubstances. Such prohibition is already  contained  in  <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_63\">Section  8(c)</a>.    It\nonly contemplates of the framing of Rules for permitting and regulating  any\nactivity of DEALING IN narcotic drugs or psychotropic substances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">27.   Therefore, we are of the opinion that the conclusion  reached  by  the\nvarious High Courts that  prohibition  contained  under  <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_64\">Section  8</a>  is  not\nattracted in respect to all  those  psychotropic  substances  which  find  a\nmention in the <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_65\">Schedule to the Act</a>  but  not  in  Schedule-I  to  the  Rules\nframed under the Act is untenable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1742083\" id=\"span_6\">28.   However, it is brought to our notice that conclusion such as  the  one\nreached by the various  High  Courts  as  noted  above  is  supported  by  a\njudgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1742083/\" id=\"a_66\">Rajesh Kumar Gupta</a> (supra).  At para  19,  it  was\nheld;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">“19. It has not been brought to our notice that the 1985  Act  provides  for\nthe manner and extent of possession of  the  contraband.  The  rules  framed\nunder <a href=\"/doc/941534/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 9</a> of the 1985 Act  read  with  Section  76  thereof,  however,\nprovide for both the manner and  the  extent,  inter  alia,  of  production,\nmanufacture, possession, sale, purchase, transport, etc. of the  contraband.\nChapter VI of the 1985 Rules provides for import, export and  trans-shipment\nof narcotic drugs and psychotropic  substances.  Rule  53  contains  general\nprohibition in terms whereof the import and  export  out  of  India  of  the\nnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances specified in Schedule I  appended\nthereto is prohibited. Such prohibition, however, is subject  to  the  other\nprovisions of the said Chapter. Rule 63 to  which  our  attention  has  been\ndrawn specifically prohibits import and export  of  consignments  through  a\npost [pic]office box but keeping in view the general  prohibition  contained\nin Rule 53 the  same  must  be  held  to  apply  only  to  those  drugs  and\npsychotropic substances which are mentioned in Schedule I of the  Rules  and\nnot under the 1985 Act. Similarly, Chapter  VII  provides  for  psychotropic\nsubstances. Rule 64 provides for  general  prohibition.  Rules  53  and  64,\nthus, contain a genus and other provisions  following  the  same  under  the\nsaid Chapter are species thereof. This we say  in  view  of  the  fact  that\nwhereas Rule 64  provides  for  general  prohibition  in  respect  of  sale,\npurchase, consumption or use of the  psychotropic  substances  specified  in\nSchedule I,  Rule  65  prohibits  manufacture  of  psychotropic  substances,\nwhereas Rule 66 prohibits possession, etc. of  psychotropic  substances  and\nRule  67  prohibits  transport  thereof.  Rule  67-A  provides  for  special\nprovisions for medical and scientific purposes.”\n\n(emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">29.   We are unable to agree with the conclusion (reached  in  Rajesh  Kumar\nGupta’s case) that the prohibition contained in  Rule  63[11]  of  the  1985\nRules  is  applicable  only  to  those  narcotic  drugs   and   psychotropic\nsubstances which are mentioned in Schedule-I to the Rules  and  not  to  the\npsychotropic substances enumerated in the  <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_68\">Schedule  to  the  Act</a>.   Such  a\nconclusion was reached in Rajesh Kumar Gupta’s  case  on  the  understanding\nthat Rule 53 (prohibiting the import into and export out  of  India  of  the\nnarcotic drugs and psychotropic substances specified in  Schedule-I  to  the\nRules) is the  source  of  the  authority  for  such  prohibition.   Such  a\nconclusion was drawn from the fact that the other  Rules  contained  in  the\nChapter permit import into and export  out  of  India  of  certain  narcotic\ndrugs and psychotropic substances other than those specified  in  Schedule-I\nto  the  Rules.  Unfortunately,  the  learned  Judges  in  reaching  such  a\nconclusion ignored the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 8(c)</a> which  inter  alia  prohibits\nin absolute terms import into and export out of India of any  narcotic  drug\nand psychotropic substance. Rules framed under the Act cannot be  understood\nto create rights and obligations contrary to those contained in  the  parent\nAct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">30.   On examination of the scheme  of  Rules  53  to  63  which  appear  in\nChapter VI, we are of the opinion that Rule 53[12] reiterates an  aspect  of\nthe larger prohibition contained in <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 8(c)</a> i.e.,  the  prohibition  of\nimport into and export out of India of the narcotic drugs  and  psychotropic\nsubstances specified in  Schedule-I  to  the  Rules.   The  proviso  thereto\nhowever enables the import into and export out of India on the basis  of  an\nimport certificate or export authorisation issued under  the  provisions  of\nChapter VI. The subsequent Rules stipulate the conditions subject  to  which\nand the procedure to be followed by which some of  the  narcotic  drugs  and\npsychotropic substances could be imported into  India  or  exported  out  of\nIndia.  For example, opium is a narcotic drug by  definition  under  <a href=\"/doc/1777979/\" id=\"a_71\">Section\n2(xiv)</a> of the Act whose export and import is prohibited under <a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_72\">Section  8(c)</a>.\n But Rule  54[13]  authorizes  the  import  of  opium  by  Government  opium\nfactory.  The construction such as the one  placed  on  Rule  53  in  Rajesh\nKumar Gupta’s case would in  our  opinion  be  wholly  against  the  settled\ncanons of statutory interpretation that the subordinate  legislation  cannot\nmake stipulation contrary to the parent Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">31.   Chapter VII deals with psychotropic substances. No doubt  Rule  64[14]\nonce again purports to prohibit various operations other  than  import  into\nor export out of India in psychotropic substances  specified  in  Schedule-I\nfor the obvious  reason  that  import  and  export  operations  are  already\ncovered by Rule 53.  Rule 65  authorizes  the  manufacture  of  psychotropic\nsubstances other than those specified in Schedule-I to the Rules subject  to\nand in accordance with the conditions of a licence granted  under  the  1945\nRules.  The rule also provides for various other incidental  matters.   Rule\n65A prohibits the sale, purchase, consumption or  use  of  any  psychotropic\nsubstances except in accordance with the 1945 Rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">32.    Rule  66  prohibits  any  person  from  having  in   possession   any\npsychotropic substance even for any of the  purposes  authorized  under  the\n1945 Rules unless the person in possession of such a psychotropic  substance\nis lawfully authorized to possess such substance for  any  of  the  purposes\nmentioned under the 1985 Rules.  Persons who are authorized under  the  1985\nRules, and the quantities of the material such  persons  are  authorized  to\npossess, are specified under Rule 66(2).  They are-\nany  research  institution  or  a  hospital  or  dispensary  maintained   or\nsupported by Government etc. – Rule 66(2).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">individuals where  such  possession  is  needed  for  personal  medical  use\nsubject of course to the limits and conditions specified – the two  provisos\nto Rule 66(2).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">33.   Rule 66 reads as follows —\nRule 66. Possession, etc., of psychotropic substances.—(1) No  person  shall\npossess any psychotropic substance for any of the purposes  covered  by  the\n1945 Rules, unless he is lawfully authorized to possess such  substance  for\nany of the said purposes under these rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">(2)   Notwithstanding anything  contained  in  sub-rule  (1),  any  research\ninstitution  or  a  hospital  or  dispensary  maintained  or  supported   by\nGovernment or local body or by charity or voluntary subscription,  which  is\nnot authorized to possess any psychotropic substance under the  1945  Rules,\nor any person who is not so authorized under the 1945 Rules, may  possess  a\nreasonable quantity of such substance as may be necessary for their  genuine\nscientific requirements, or both for such period as is deemed  necessary  by\nthe said research institution or, as the case may be, the said  hospital  or\ndispensary or person:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">Provided that where such psychotropic  substance  is  in  possession  of  an\nindividual for his personal medical  use  the  quantity  thereof  shall  not\nexceed one hundred dosage units at a time:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">Provided further than an individual may possess the  quantity  of  exceeding\none hundred dosage units at a time but not exceeding  three  hundred  dosage\nunits at a time for his personal  long  term  medical  use  if  specifically\nprescribed by a Registered Medical Practitioner.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(3)   The research institution, hospital and dispensary referred to in  sub-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">rule (2) shall maintain proper accounts  and  records  in  relation  to  the\npurchase and consumption of the psychotropic substance in their possession.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">34.   On the above analysis of the provisions of chapters VI and VII of  the\n1985 Rules, we are  of  the  opinion,  both  these  Chapters  contain  Rules\npermitting and regulating the  import  and  export  of  narcotic  drugs  and\npsychotropic substances other than those specified in the Schedule-I to  the\n1985 Rules  subject  to  various  conditions  and  procedure  stipulated  in\nChapter VI.  Whereas  Chapter  VII  deals  exclusively  with  various  other\naspects of DEALING IN psychotropic substances and the conditions subject  to\nwhich such DEALING IN is permitted.  We are of the opinion that  both  Rules\n53 and 64 are really in the nature of exception to  the  general  scheme  of\nChapters VI and VII respectively containing a list  of  narcotic  drugs  and\npsychotropic substances which cannot be dealt in any manner  notwithstanding\nthe other provisions of these two chapters. We  are  of  the  clear  opinion\nthat neither Rule 53 nor Rule 64 is a source of  authority  for  prohibiting\nthe DEALING IN narcotic drugs and psychotropic  substances,  the  source  is\n<a href=\"/doc/499335/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 8</a>.  Rajesh Kumar Gupta’s case in our view is wrongly decided.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">35.   In view of our conclusion, the complete analysis of  the  implications\nof Section 80[15] of the Act is not really called for in the  instant  case.\nIt is only required to be stated that  essentially  the  <a href=\"/doc/1891720/\" id=\"a_74\">Drugs  &amp;  Cosmetics\nAct, 1940</a> deals with various operations of manufacture, sale, purchase  etc.\nof drugs generally whereas <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_75\">Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic  Substances  Act,\n1985</a> deals with a more specific class of drugs  and,  therefore,  a  special\nlaw on the subject. Further the provisions of the Act  operate  in  addition\nto the provisions of 1940 Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">36.   In the light of our above conclusion the  correctness  of  the  orders\nimpugned in all the Criminal Appeals is normally required to  be  considered\nby the Bench of appropriate strength.  However, in view  of  the  fact  that\nmost of these matters are old matters [pertaining to years  2006  to  2013],\nwe deem it appropriate to remit all these  matters  to  the  concerned  High\nCourts for passing of appropriate orders in the light of this judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">37.
