On   March  23,   2001,  a   gang  of   four  criminals \n\ncomprising  of Rambabu  Gadariya, Dayaram,  Pratap and  Gopal, \n\nwhile returning from Dabra to Gwalior after attending court, \n\nescaped   from   the   police   custody.     Allegedly,   these   four \n\ncriminals escaped with the help and connivance of the police \n\nofficers and/or  negligence/inaction of the guards escorting \n\nthem.     After   escaping   from   the   police   custody,   these   four \n\ncriminals  murdered 14  persons in  village Bhanwarpura.  This \n\nled   to   harassment   and   torture   of   persons   from   gadariya \n\n\f\nCriminal Appeal NO.  104  OF 2012 \n(arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 5877 of 2004)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                      2</span>\n\n\n\n\n(Baghel)   caste   by   the   police.     They   initially   filed \n\ncomplaint   with   the   District   Judge,   but   later   on   the   first \n\nrespondent-Ram   Prakash   Singh   filed   a   Writ   Petition   (being \n\nWrit   Petition   No.   747   of   2001)   in   the   nature   of   Public \n\nInterest Litigation before the High Court of Madhya Pradesh, \n\nBench at Gwalior. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.                In   that   Writ   Petition,   it   was   alleged   that \n\nafter   escape   of   four   dacoits   noted   above   from   police \n\ncustody, the police has started torturing the persons from \n\nBaghel  community in the Gwalior district.   Accordingly, it \n\nwas   prayed   that   the   State   of   Madhya   Pradesh   and   its \n\nfunctionaries   (respondents   therein)   be   directed   to   refrain \n\nfrom  causing  torture  to  the  people  of  Baghel  Samaj  in  the \n\ndistrict of Gwalior and directions be issued for protection \n\nof their life and liberty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.                The   matter   came   up   for   consideration   before \n\nthe High Court on various dates.   As the matter was in the \n\nnature of public interest litigation and the grievance was \n\nraised   that   the   above   criminals   after   their   escape   were \n\ncausing havoc and they have not been taken into custody by \n\nthe police which has caused huge fear in the minds of the \n\npeople of the area, the High Court issued various directions \n\nfrom   time   to   time.     The   High   Court   asked   the   State \n\nGovernment   to   hold   an   enquiry   into   the   escape   of   above \n\n\f\nCriminal Appeal NO.  104  OF 2012 \n(arising out of S.L.P. (Criminal) No. 5877 of 2004)\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                       3</span>\n\n\n\n\ncriminals   from   the   police   custody   and   submit   the   report \n\nregarding action taken against the  officers responsible for \n\nthe   lapse.   Despite   numerous   opportunities,   the   State \n\nGovernment failed to respond to the directions given by the \n\nHigh  Court satisfactorily  which constrained  the High  Court \n\nto direct the Director General of Police, Madhya Pradesh, to \n\nremain present in the Court.   It appears that the Advocate \n\nGeneral   of   the   State   of   Madhya   Pradesh   made   a   statement \n\nbefore   the   High   Court   that   the   enquiry   into   the   episode \n\nshall be conducted by a very senior office of the State and \n\nreport submitted to the Court.  However, nothing happened in \n\nthe   matter.   The   High   Court   then   called   the   Principal \n\nSecretary   (Home)   in   the   Court.     The   Principal   Secretary \n\n(Home) appeared and made a statement that the enquiry into \n\nthe matter shall be conducted within a period of two months \n\nfrom   March   9,   2004.     On   June   30,   2004,   on   behalf   of   the \n\nState   Government,   time   was   sought   for   submission   of   the \n\nenquiry report, but no enquiry report was submitted.  In the \n\nbackdrop   of   consistent   inaction   on   the   part   of   the   State \n\nGovernment   in   the   matter,   on   November   8,   2004,   the   High \n\nCourt   asked   the   Central   Bureau   of   Investigation   (CBI)   to \n\nhold   enquiry   into   the   matter   of   escape   of   the   above \n\ncriminals   from   the   police   custody   and   the   role   of   the \n\nofficers   posted   at   Gwalior,   particularly   the   role   of \n\n\f\nCriminal Appeal NO.  104  OF 2012 \n(arising out of S.L.P.

Though we have set aside the order \n\nof  the  High  Court  impugned  in  this  Appeal  for  the  reasons \n\nnoted   above,   but   the   handling   of   the   matter   by   the   State \n\nGovernment   and   its   functionaries   has   been   far   from \n\nsatisfactory.
