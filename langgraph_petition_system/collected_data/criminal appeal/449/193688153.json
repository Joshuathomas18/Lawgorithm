Reports were obtained from the\n\nChemical examiner, the RFSL and the Central Forensic Science Laboratory.\n\nAfter completion of the evidence, a charge sheet was filed against all the four\n\naccused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">5.    The Trial Court framed the charges against all four accused under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 34</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_8\">120B</a> read with 34, 201 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_9\">Section\n\n34</a> of IPC.

The accused Ashok Mishra took specific defence that he had got\n\nregistered so many cases against the police officers, thus, they were keeping\n\nanimosity with him. The radiator of his car was heated, his brother-in-law\n\nMitramani Tripathi had taken the vehicle for repair and got repaired from the\n\nmechanic. During this period he was in his office.

After conclusion of the trial, the Trial Court convicted and sentenced\n\nthe appellants as aforesaid. Being aggrieved, the appellants and the\n\nrevisioner preferred these appeals and the revision.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">8.     Shri Kishore Bhaduri, counsel for accused Ashok Mishra vehemently\n\nargued that the trial Court has not appreciated the evidence in proper\n\nperspective, the accused has proved plea of alibi which has been overlooked\n\nby the trial Court. He had no motive for the commission of alleged offences.\n\nDeceased had inimical relation with other persons hence possibility of\n\ncommission of offences by such persons cannot be ruled out. The trial Court\n\nhas given unnecessary weightage to the evidence of brother of the deceased,\n\nmother of the deceased and their maid. He had got initiated proceedings\n\nagainst    police officers and administrative officers. The links of the\n\ncircumstances do not form the complete chain.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">9.     Shri Sudhir Verma, Counsel for accused Harish Patnaik argued that\n\nalleged memorandum and seizure regarding this accused are dis-believable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">10.    Shri A.K. Athaley, counsel for accused Khemraj Agrawal argued that no\n\ncogent evidence is available against him. He was present in the hospital at\n\nthe relevant time. The trial Court wrongly disbelieved his defence witnesses.\n\nHe has been falsely implicated in this case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">11.    Smt. Hameeda Siddiqui, Counsel for the accused Amit Mishra argued\n\nthat he is the nephew of accused Ashok Mishra and was called at the place\n\nwhere the car was stuck. No evidence regarding his complicity in the offence\n\nis available on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_14\">12.    On the other hand, Shri U.N.S. Dev, Govt. Advocate appearing for the\n\nState supported the impugned judgment and argued that aforesaid conviction\n\nand sentences are based on clinching evidence available on record and do\n\nnot call for any interference.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                        6</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">13.    Shri H.S. Ahluwalia, Counsel for the revisioner argued that the\n\nprosecution has proved the circumstantial evidence for killing the deceased\n\nagainst the all four accused. The trial Court failed to apply the provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 34</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_11\">120-B</a> of the IPC against accused Khemraj Agrawal.\n\nDeceased was brutally murdered. Thus, all four accused should be awarded\n\nwith death sentence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">14.    Points   for    determination   :- There    are   following   points   for\n\ndetermination in this case -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">(1)     Whether in the intervening night of 21 st and 22nd of October, 2003,\n\naccused Ashok Kumar Mishra, Harish Patnaik, Khemraj Agrawal and Amit\n\nMishra had the common intention to cause murder of deceased Sangita Kalia\n\nand in furtherance thereof they murdered her.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">(2)     Whether at the same time all 4 accused had hatched criminal\n\nconspiracy of murder of deceased Sangita Kalia.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">(3)     Whether all 4 accused in furtherance of common intention caused\n\ndisappearance of evidence of the murder of deceased Sangita Kalia by\n\nthrowing her dead body in field.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_21\">Points for determination no. 1, 2, 3 and 4 :- Finding with reasons\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">15.    Looking to the convenience, points for determination No. 1 to 4 are\n\nbeing decided simultaneously.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">16.    The case of the prosecution regarding murder of the deceased\n\nSangeeta Kalia is based on circumstantial evidence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">                 NATURE OF DEATH OF THE DECEASED\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">17.    First and foremost question for consideration before us is that, whether\n\ndeath of the deceased Sangita Kalia was culpable homicide.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_26\">18.    As per the alleged document regarding post-mortem of deceased\n\nSangita Kalia Ex.P-98, P.W. 22 Dr. V.K. Mehta and P.W. 23 Dr. Usha Kiran\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                        7</span>\n\nBhagat had conducted the autopsy of deceased Sangita Kalia on 22-10-2003\n\nat 3.50 pm. P.W. 22 Dr. V.K. Mehta says in para-2 of his statement given on\n\noath that in her internal examination one L.W. was found on her scalp of size\n\n10 cm x 3cm x deep bone, one L.W. on her left ankle of size 1/2 cm x1/2 cm x\n\n1/2 cm. Parietal bone was fractured on both sides. The injuries were ante\n\nmortem in nature caused by hard and blunt object. He opined that death was\n\nhomicidal in nature, caused due to coma and shock due to head injury.\n\nDuration was within 18-24 hr. Deceased was pregnant by 20-22 weeks .\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">19.   As per Ex. P-98 the death of deceased Sangita Kalia occurred\n\nbetween 3.50 pm to 9.50 pm of 21-10-2003.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">20.   P.W. 22 Dr. V. K. Mehta says in paras 13 and 15 that head injury of\n\ndeceased may be caused by accident if deceased falls downright facing her\n\nhead on a hard object. Head injury of deceased may be accidental.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">21.   There is no material available on record on strength of which it could\n\nbe said that allegedly the deceased fell downright facing her head on a hard\n\nobject. Thus, appellants do not get any help from the statements of Para 13\n\nand 15 of P.W. 22 Dr. VK Mehta.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">22.   There is no such evidence on record on strength of which it could be\n\nsaid that Ex. P-98 is not believable. Thus, this court believes on Ex. P-98.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">23.   After appreciation of the evidence discussed herebefore this Court\n\nfinds that prosecution has proved beyond reasonable doubt that death of\n\ndeceased Sangita Kalia was homicidal in nature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">24.   Looking to the head injury of deceased Sangeeta Kalia it is very clear\n\nthat head injury was caused with intention to cause death or it is caused with\n\nthe intention of causing bodily injury and the bodily injury intended to be\n\ninflicted was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. Thus,\n\nthis Court finds that the culpable homicide of deceased Sangita Kalia is\n\nmurder.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                        8</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">                                   MOTIVE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_35\">25.    Second question for our consideration is that, whether accused Ashok\n\nKumar Mishra had motive to cause murder of deceased Sangita Kalia.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">26.    As per the alleged opinion of the State Examiner Of Questioned\n\nDocument, Government of Chhattisgarh, Raipur Ex. P-59, P.W.           21 hand\n\nwriting expert N.K. Sikkewar had examined the documents and opined that\n\nthe person who wrote the red enclosed writings and signature stamped and\n\nmarked A-1 to A-24 also wrote the red enclosed writings and signatures\n\nsimilarly stamped and marked Q1-Q3. In this case A-1 to A-24 have been\n\nexhibited as Ex.P-33 to Ex.P-52 which are the handwriting samples of\n\naccused Ashok Kumar Mishra. Q-1 is alleged agreement dated 1-4-99\n\nmarked as Ex.P-30, Q-2 is alleged letter dated 04-09-98 marked as Ex.P-31,\n\nQ-3 is alleged letter marked as Ex. P-32.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">27.    He also opined that the person who wrote the red enclosed writings\n\nstamped and marked S-1 to S-11 also wrote the red enclosed writings\n\nsimilarly stamped and marked Q-4 to Q-6. In this case, S-1 to S-11 have\n\nbeen exhibited as Ex. P-55 to Ex.P-58 which are the letters of deceased\n\nSangita Kalia, Q-4 to Q-6 are exhibited as Ex. P-53 and Ex.P-54.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">28.    There is no such evidence on record on strength of which it could be\n\nsaid that Ex. P-59 is not believable. Looking to this fact and concerned\n\nadmitted fact, this court believes on Ex. P-59.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_39\">29.    P.W. 31 Rajeev Kalia who is the brother of deceased Sangita Kalia\n\nsays in para 2, 3, 4, 7, and 8 of his statement given on oath that love affair\n\nwas developed between deceased Sangita Kalia and accused Ashok Kumar\n\nMishra. They lived together in Rajmahal Hotel and in quarter No. 6 of\n\nAnathalay. He was beating and harassing her. She was conceived by that\n\nrelationship. He was giving threatening to her to abort otherwise he would kill\n\nher. Few days ago from the incident he had come in his house and gave\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                        9</span>\n\nsame threatening.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">30.   P.W.50 Smt. Kuldeep Kalia who is mother of the deceased gives\n\nsimilar statements in para 2, 3, 4, 6 and 7 of her statement given on oath.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_41\">31.   P.W. 36 Dr. V. Dubey says in para 2 of her statement given on oath\n\nthat on 13-7-2000 she examined deceased Sangita Kalia. Her pregnancy\n\ntest was positive. To avoid miscarriage she had prescribed medicines to her,\n\nthe prescription is Ex. P-102.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">32.   There is no such evidence on record on the strength of which it could\n\nbe said that aforesaid statements of P.W. 31 Rajeev Kalia, P.W. 50 Kuldeep\n\nKalia in this reference that allegedly deceased Sangita Kalia and accused\n\nAshok Kumar Mishra had intimate relationship, he was harassing her,\n\ndeceased Sangita Kalia was carrying pregnancy, he was giving threatening to\n\nher to abort lest he will kill her, few days ago he had given same threatening,\n\naforesaid statement of P.W. 36 Dr. V. Dubey, her prescription Ex. P-102, are\n\nnot believable.

IA No. 2 of 2018 is an application filed by the Revision Petitioner for\n\ntaking further evidence or to direct it to be taken under <a href=\"/doc/782148/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 391</a> CrPC.\n\nThe attempt is to have a further forensic examination by way of DNA test\n\nsince the report before the Trial Court was to the effect that the sample was\n\ninsufficient. The adjudication by the Trial Court and appreciation of evidence\n\nby us are not dependent on any scientific evidence and forensic material, to\n\nconnect the 1st Accused-Ashok Kumar Mishra to the foetus harvested from\n\nthe dead body of the deceased. The findings arrived at in this judgment are\n\nnot based on the contents of the FSL report in that regard, either in favour of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                         27</span>\n\nthe prosecution or in favor of the accused. In that view of the matter, there is\n\nno room for any further consideration of the said application notwithstanding\n\nthe fact that even according to the Public Prosecutor, no material is now\n\navailable as relatable to that foetus for any further scientific investigation. That\n\napplication is only to be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_145\">109. The learned counsel for the Revision Petitioner pointed out that the\n\nproviso to <a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 372</a> CrPC confers a right of appeal on the victim. He,\n\ntherefore, pleaded that the revision may be treated as an appeal in terms of\n\nthat provision.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"79321377\" id=\"span_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"29443922\" id=\"span_48\">110. Appeal is a statutory remedy. Right of appeal is created and conferred\n\nthrough statutory provision and is regulated and controlled thereby. <a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_38\">Section\n\n372</a> CrPC excludes all modes of appeal from any judgment or order of a\n\ncriminal court except as provided for by the Code or by any other law for the\n\ntime being in force. Appeal against acquittal is provided for as per <a href=\"/doc/487026/\" id=\"a_39\">Section\n\n378</a> CrPC and it is made conditional on leave being granted by the High\n\nCourt. <a href=\"/doc/29443922/\" id=\"a_40\">Through Satya Pal Singh v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>; (<a href=\"/doc/79321377/\" id=\"a_41\">2015) 15\n\nSCC 613 and Roopendra Singh v. State of Tripura</a>; (2017) 13 SCC 612,\n\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India laid down the law that an appeal against\n\nthe order of acquittal under the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 372</a> CrPC cannot be\n\nmaintained without obtaining leave as required under <a href=\"/doc/613293/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 378(3)</a> CrPC.\n\nThe right to question the correctness of the judgment and order of acquittal or\n\norder of conviction for a lesser offence, as available under the proviso to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 372</a> CrPC can be exercised by a &quot;victim&quot; as defined in <a href=\"/doc/760919/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 2(wa)</a>\n\nCrPC, only after obtaining leave of the High Court as required under <a href=\"/doc/487026/\" id=\"a_46\">Section\n\n378</a> CrPC.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_147\">111. The quality and content of the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court\n\nwhile dealing with a revision under <a href=\"/doc/1457888/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 397</a> CrPC is not to be equated\n\nwith that of the Court hearing a criminal appeal, including one referable to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                        28</span>\n\nproviso to <a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 372</a> CrPC. Notwithstanding the scope and ambit of <a href=\"/doc/1571667/\" id=\"a_49\">Section\n\n401</a> CrPC, the revisional jurisdiction of the High Court is not to be treated as\n\ncoextensive with the powers of the Appellate Court as delineated in <a href=\"/doc/1256523/\" id=\"a_50\">Section\n\n386</a> CrPC. This is so, notwithstanding the wider jurisdictional gamut available\n\nto the High Court in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1571667/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 401</a> CrPC. It is also sound, as a\n\nprinciple, that distinction has to be maintained between converting an appeal\n\nto a revision and converting a revision to an appeal; be it in any jurisdiction\n\nwhich provides for appellate and revisional interference.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_148\">112. For the reasons stated in the immediately preceding two paragraphs,\n\nthe revision invoking <a href=\"/doc/1457888/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 397</a> CrPC cannot be converted to an appeal\n\nunder the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 372</a> CrPC at the instance of the victim as against\n\nan order of acquittal or an order of conviction for a lesser offence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">113. The proviso to <a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 372</a> CrPC was inserted as per the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure (Amendment) Act, 2009, Central Act No. 5 of 2009, which\n\nobtained the assent of the President on 05.01.2009 and was published in the\n\nGazette of India on that date. Sub <a href=\"/doc/1093366/\" id=\"a_55\">section 1(2)</a> of that <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_56\">Amending Act</a> provides\n\nthat it shall come into force on such date as the Central Government may, by\n\nnotification in the Official Gazette, appoint and different dates may be\n\nappointed for different provisions of this Act. As per notification No. S.O.\n\n3313(E) dated 30.12.2009, published in the Gazette of India dated\n\n30.12.2009, the Central Government appointed 31 st day of December, 2009\n\nas the date on which the provisions of the said Act, except <a href=\"/doc/94717/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 5</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1536853/\" id=\"a_58\">Section\n\n6</a> and clause (b) of <a href=\"/doc/1712157/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 21</a>, shall come into force. Thus, the proviso to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 372</a> CrPC, as inserted by the Act 5 of 2009, came into force only on\n\n31.12.2009. The incident which led to the prosecution of the accused persons\n\nin this case occurred on 21/22.10.2003. The Court of Session has recorded\n\nthe date of institution of the proceeding as 05.02.2004. The findings, sentence\n\nand order which are challenged in these appeals, and subjected to the\n\nrevision as well, were delivered through the judgment dated 27.04.2009. All\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                         29</span>\n\nthese events occurred before 31.12.2009, the date on which the proviso to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 372</a> CrPC came into force. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"663930\" id=\"span_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1009966\" id=\"span_52\">Larger questions may arise for\n\nconsideration in the backdrop of the different constitutional provisions\n\nincluding those in Part III of the Constitution if we were to consider whether\n\nthe victim&#x27;s right of appeal under the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 372</a> CrPC would be\n\navailable in cases where the occurrence, cognizance, trial and acquittal or\n\nconviction for a lesser offence occurred prior to 31.12.2009, the date of\n\ncoming into force of the insertion of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 372</a> CrPC. An\n\norder which is final on the date on which it is made gives rise to vested rights\n\nand a subsequent change in law, giving rise to new right of appeal or revision,\n\nis presumed not to affect the finality of the orders already made. Conferral of\n\nwider jurisdiction, by an <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_64\">Amending Act</a>, on the High Court to interfere in\n\nrevision, is not a mere matter of procedure but one that relates to substantive\n\nrights; and the wider jurisdiction cannot be invoked against an order made\n\nbefore commencement of the <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_65\">Amending Act</a>. {See: <a href=\"/doc/1009966/\" id=\"a_66\">Dafedar Niranjan Singh\n\nv. Custodian, Evacuee Property</a>; <a href=\"/doc/663930/\" id=\"a_67\">AIR 1961 SC 1425 and Keshavlal\n\nJethalal Shah v. Mohanlal</a>; AIR 1968 SC 1336}. The acquittal of a person\n\nfollowing trial in a criminal case is an order which is final. Such finality carries\n\nwith it the substantive right of the accused persons to rest assured that the\n\norder of acquittal or conviction for lesser offence would remain intact unless\n\ninterfered with by duly authorised appellate or revisional procedure in\n\naccordance with law. Before the insertion of proviso to <a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 372</a> CrPC, an\n\norder of acquittal could have been interfered with, only through appeal as\n\nprovided for by the Code; or, through a revision under <a href=\"/doc/1457888/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 397</a> CrPC to\n\nthe extent to which the revisional jurisdiction may permit. Whether that\n\nsituation could be altered by insertion of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 372</a> CrPC\n\nthrough the <a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_71\">Amending Act</a>, to the disadvantage of the accused who stands\n\nacquitted is a question which may call for deeper consideration in the light of\n\nthe second limb of <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_72\">Article 20(1)</a> of the Constitution which enjoins that no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                                       30</span>\n\nperson shall be subjected to a penalty greater than that might have been\n\ninflicted under the law in force at the time of commission of the offence. This\n\nappears to be relevant because the phrase &quot;under the law in force at the time\n\nof commission of offence&quot; includes substantive law and such procedural law\n\nwhich relates to substantive rights which would have crystallised at the\n\nconclusion of the trial and verdict by the trial Court. The provisions by way of\n\nappeal or revision against an order of acquittal or an order of conviction for\n\nlesser offence, are    essentially   pieces of substantive law, whereby the\n\naccused would be open to conviction and sentence over and above that\n\nwhich was handed down by the trial Court before coming into force of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1596533/\" id=\"a_73\">Amending Act</a>. That way also, we do not see our way to hold that the revision\n\nfiled by the mother of the deceased victim, and now being prosecuted by her\n\nson, could be treated as an appeal under the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 372</a> CrPC.</span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_150\">114. Insofar as revision under <a href=\"/doc/1457888/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 397</a> CrPC is concerned, on a\n\nthorough examination of the entire materials on record, no ground or reason\n\nis seen to hold that the findings, sentence and order, to the extent challenged\n\nthrough the revision are liable to be interfered with, on the ground that they\n\nare wrong, illegal or improper. The proceedings carried before the Court\n\nbelow cannot, also, be impeached as irregular on any ground referable to the\n\nissues involved in the revision. The acquittal of Accused No. 3-Khemraj\n\nAgrawal of charges referable to Sections 302 and 120-B read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 34</a>\n\nIPC cannot be held to be wrong or improper on the basis of materials on\n\nrecord. There is no ground to hold that the learned trial Judge acted contrary\n\nto law in confining the punishment handed down to Accused No.1, 2 and 4,\n\nnamely Ashok Kumar Mishra, Harish Patnayak and Amit Mishra, respectively\n\non counts under Sections 302 and 120-B read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 34</a> IPC to be life\n\nimprisonment and not capital punishment. The findings of the Court below\n\nand the reasons stated in support of the conclusions, order and sentence are\n\nsustainable in law, on the basis of the materials on record. The impugned\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                        31</span>\n\norder does not warrant interference in       revision, either in relation to the\n\nfindings, and/or order of sentence. The revision therefore fails.\n\nPer Sharad Kumar Gupta, Judge\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">115.
