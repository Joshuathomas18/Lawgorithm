They were also accompanied by 5-6 other\npersons and from the first floor, they dragged deceased Narendra @\nBablu out of his room and took him out to the street where in front\nof the house of Gopal and Rambudane, he was assaulted by all the\naccused persons and a gun shot was also fired on his head. It was\nalso stated by Pw/5 Sanjay that the entire incident has also been\nwitnessed by Bablu&#x27;s wife Pw/4 Sona. It was also stated that after\nhearing the commotion, Manoj, Yogi and others also came to the\nspot and seeing them, all the accused persons ran away from the\nspot. Bablu was taken to M.Y. Hospital by this witness Sanjay\nalong with Pw/6 Manoj and Pw/1 Vikram where he was declared\ndead. This report was registered by PW/25 Tarunendra Singh and\nproved as Ex.P/6. A Marg was also registered and investigation\nensued. During the course of investigation, the statements of the\nwitnesses were recorded and the accused persons were arrested and\nvarious weapons were also recovered from them. From the\npossession of appellant Shailendra, a country made pistol was also\nrecovered vide Ex.P/19. From the possession of appellants Ramjane\nand Sunil, iron rods were recovered and from possession of\nappellant Golu @ Goldi, a sword vide Ex.P/17 and Ex.P/22 and\nfrom possession of Jitendra @ J.D., a sword has been recovered.\nAmardeep @ Machchi got recovered a belt. From the possession of\nappellant Ranjeet, a stick has been recovered. Subsequently the\ncharge sheet was filed and the accused persons were put to trial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      8</span>\n\nbefore the Trial Court and the learned judge, vide its impugned\njudgment has convicted them as aforesaid.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">3]    Shri Vivek Singh, learned counsel appearing for the appellant\nRanjeet Singh in Cr.A. No.128/2012 and appellants Indersingh and\nVikram in Cr.A. No.129/2012 has submitted that the names of these\nappellants Ranjeet Singh, Indresingh and Vikramsingh also did not\nfind place in the FIR and the prosecution has not been able to prove\nits case beyond reasonable doubt and there are many omissions and\ncontradictions in the depositions of the prosecution witnesses. In\nsuch circumstances, the conviction awarded to the appellants cannot\nbe sustained.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">4]    Counsel has drawn the attention of this Court to the\ndeposition of PW/1 Vikram, the father of the deceased, who has\nstated that prior in the day i.e. 10/07/2006, a dispute took place\nbetween the deceased Narendra on one hand and Shailu, Goldi,\nMachchi, Ramjane, Pappi, Jacky @ Hanuman, Jitendra and others\nand they had also assaulted his son Narendra at that time. It is\nsubmitted that this witness Vikram was not present on the spot\nwhen the incident took place as he himself has stated that at the\ntime when the incident took place, his younger son Manoj came\nrunning to their house and informed that the accused persons are\nassaulting Narendra and thereafter he started towards the place of\nincident from his home along with other family members. This\nwitness has also admitted that he and his son Bablu, the deceased\nhave also faced externment proceedings wherein they were externed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                        9</span>\n\nfrom the district Indore and he himself has also been detained under\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/190229/\" id=\"a_9\">National Security Act</a>. Thus, it is submitted by the\ncounsel that a person with tainted background cannot be relied\nupon.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">5]      Counsel has laid special emphasis on the fact that even\naccording to this witness Pw/1 Vikram, he had heard a gunshot\nfired, however, there was no gunshot injury suffered by the\ndeceased. This witness has also admitted that he knows Shailu for\nquite some time and the dispute between the deceased Bablu and\nappellant Shailu was only pursuant to staring each other which led\nto the deceased Narendra, Manoj, Nitesh giving a beating to the\nappellant Shailu who had also lodged a police report regarding this\nincident. Counsel has submitted that this witness, despite being\nfather of the deceased has not lodged the FIR himself and asked the\nother person Pw/9 Sanju to lodge the same which creates\nreasonable doubt about the veracity of the prosecution case. He has\ndenied that the deceased Bablu was found lying on the road and\nsomebody informed him and thereafter, his younger son Manoj took\nBablu to the hospital. He has also been suggested that at the time of\nincident, there was no light available, to which, he has stated that at\nthe time when the incident took place, there was a street light on\nroad, although he has feigned ignorance as to why this fact has not\nbeen stated in his 161 statement Ex.D/1.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">6]      Similarly, PW/3 Sanni happens to be a chance witness, he is\nthe nephew of PW/1 Vikram in whose house he had gone in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                      10</span>\n\nnight to sleep, he has also narrated the same story that Manoj came\nto their house at around 12-12:15 am and informed them about\nBablu being assaulted by the accused persons and when they\nreached on the spot, they saw the appellants assaulting the\ndeceased.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">7]    Shri Singh, learned counsel has also submitted that the wife\nof the deceased, Pw/4 Sona, has although named the appellants,\nhowever, her testimony needs to be examined cautiously as she\nappears to have lied regarding her marriage with the deceased and\nalso about her religion. It is submitted that Pw/4 Sona has admitted\nthat in her 161 statement, she has not named J.D. @ Jitendra and\nMachchi&#x27;s name, however, she has stated that she was too afraid at\nthat time.

In the FIR, the complainant PW/5 Sanjay has named\nA-Goldi, A-Ramjane, A-Shailu, and A-Machchi as the assailants\nwho were accompanied by other 5-6 accused persons. In support of\nits case, the prosecution has examined as many as 25 witnesses and\nno defence witness has been examined.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">16]   So far as the death of the deceased is concerned, his post-\nmortem has been conducted by PW/21 Dr. N.M.

A perusal of his\ndeposition reveals that the deceased had suffered as many as 20\ninjuries and there are sub-injuries of certain injuries also, suffered\nby the deceased and most of the injuries were incised wounds or\nstab wounds on various parts of his body. There is no doubt about it\nthat the deceased died a homicidal death.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">17]   So far as the culpability of the present appellants is\nconcerned, the prosecution has examined eyewitnesses who were\npresent on the spot including the complainant Sanjay as also wife,\nbrother, mother and father of the deceased. Thus, instead of\nconsidering their statements in seriatim, we would examine the\ndepositions of the prosecution witnesses in accordance with the\norder in which they have appeared in the incident.\n18]   PW/5 Sanjay is the person who had lodged the FIR Ex.P/5. In\nthe FIR he has named A-Goldi and the other accused persons viz.,\nA-Shailu, A-Ramjane and A-Machchi who came to his house along\nwith other accued persons. Pw/5 is the landlord of the deceased\nBablu @ Narendra. In his deposition in the court, he has stated that\nA-Goldi, A-Shailu, A-Ramjane, A-Machchi, and the other accused\npersons A-JD, A-Ranjeet, A-Pappi and another accused whose\nname he did not remember and who told his name to be A-Sonu in\nthe Court were involved in the incident. It is stated by him that\naccused persons broke open the doors of his house and A-Goldi\nkept a sword on his neck and told him to stay put and thereafter\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                       15</span>\n\nGoldi and Ramjane stayed with him whereas Shailu and Machchi\n@ Amardeep went upstairs to the room of deceased Bablu @\nNarendra who was his tenant and from there, they dragged him out\nwhile beating him on their way out, and Goldi and Ramjane also\nassaulted him. A-Goldi and A-Shailu were having swords, A-\nMachchi was having a belt, A-Ramjane was having pipe and other\naccused persons were having knives and pipes. He has also stated\nthat the deceased&#x27;s wife has also witnessed the entire incident and\nManoj, the son of deceased Bablu came to intervene but the\nappellants ran after him and subsequently when the people from the\nvicinity also came to the spot including the family members of the\ndeceased Bablu, the accused persons fled the spot. Regarding A-\nShailu, it is also stated that he assaulted the deceased on his\nforehead with the backside of a country made pistol. Deceased was\ntaken to the hospital and was declared as brought dead. He has also\nadmitted in para 7 of his deposition that he knows Shailu since last\naround 10 years as he is also his friend. He has admitted that till the\ndeceased Bablu was dragged down from his room to the road, he\nwas restrained in his room by the accused persons. He has also\nstated that he had shown the police the broken door, however, he\nhas feigned ignorance as to why this fact is not mentioned in the\nspot map. He has also admitted that the entire incident took place\nfor around 20 minutes. In para 23 he has also admitted that he was\naccompanied by deceased&#x27;s brother Manoj and father Vikram to the\npolice station; however, he himself lodged the report. He has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                      16</span>\n\nadmitted that he informed the police that the deceased was also shot\nby Shailu as he thought that the deceased was fired upon by the\naccused persons but he was in fact assaulted by the butt of the gun.\nHe has also stated that he had informed the police about the assault\non the deceased by sword but he cannot say the reason why this fact\nis not mentioned in his police statement. He has denied that some\nunidentified persons had committed the offence who ran from the\nspot and because he had previous enmity with Shailu, he has falsely\nnamed the names as the assailants. He has specifically denied that\nhe has been informed by the father of the deceased about identity of\nthe accused persons and their names. In para 22, he has admitted\nthat he knows A-Ranjeet since last around 6-7 years as he used to\ndrive tempo with him as he used to drive a rented tempo whereas\nRanjeet had his own tempo and for around 6 months, they have\ndriven the tempo together and has denied that he has taken\nRanjeet&#x27;s name in the court on the asking of Vikram and his son\nManoj. He has also admitted that he is well acquainted with\ndeceased&#x27;s son Manoj and his father Vikram and when he had gone\nto report the incident, Bablu&#x27;s father Vikram was also with them.\n19]   PW/5 Sanjay has also admitted that at the time when he was\nlodging the report, Manoj did not ask him that he is missing the\nother persons&#x27; name also in the report. He has feigned ignorance as\nto why Ranjeet&#x27;s name has not been mentioned in the FIR. He has\nalso admitted that Manoj never told him that he has missed in\nnaming Ranjeet in the FIR. He has also admitted that he did not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                       17</span>\n\nmention it in the police report that Shailu set on the chest of the\ndeceased and hit on his forehead with the butt of the gun and why\nthis fact has not been mentioned in the FIR, he does not know. He\nhas also been suggested that he has mentioned this fact about Shailu\nhitting the deceased with the butt on his forehead only to\ncorroborate the medical evidence. He has also admitted that he had\nmentioned in the police report that the deceased was also fired upon\nbut subsequently when he came to know that there is no gunshot\ninjury, he has changed his version. His attention is also drawn to the\nFIR Ex.P/5 wherein he has not mentioned that Shailu was also\nholding a sword in his hand and assaulted Bablu with it. His\nattention was also drawn to the fact that in the FIR, he has not\nmentioned that appellant Machchi was having belt in his hand at the\ntime of incident. His attention is also drawn to the police report\nEx.P/5, where he has not mentioned that Ramjane was holding a\npipe and had assaulted the deceased with pipe. His attention was\nalso drawn to the fact that in the FIR, it is not mentioned that when\nthe deceased&#x27;s brother Manoj came to intervene, the accused\npersons also ran after him. He has been suggested that the FIR has\nbeen lodged on the other day and the incident has not been\nwitnessed by the deceased&#x27;s wife and his brother to which he has\ndenied.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">20]   Regarding appellant Amardeep @ Machchi, he has stated that\nin his police statement, he has mentioned the name of Machchi @\nSunil and if in his court statement, the alias of Machchi is not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                      18</span>\n\nmentioned as Sunil then he does not know the reason. Regarding JD\n@ Jitendra, he has stated that he had identified JD in the police\nstation. He has admitted that the names which he has mentioned in\nthe FIR and also subsequently, he knows them from before. He has\nadmitted that he has not mentioned the name of JD, Ranjeet, Inder\nin FIR Ex.P/5 and Marg intimation P/6 as they had threatened him\nthat they would also kill him. However, he has also been asked\nwhether he has made any report against these persons that they tried\nto threatened him, to which, he has denied. This witness has stated\nthat when he lifted Bablu to take him to the hospital, his cloths were\nalso drenched in blood but the police has not seized his cloths. He\nhas also admitted that the other three persons&#x27; cloths were also\ndrenched in blood but police did not seize cloths of any of such\npersons. Regarding Sonu, he has admitted that at the time of\nlodging FIR, or in his police statement, he has not mentioned the\nname of Sonu. Thus, from his (PW/5 Sanjay&#x27;s) deposition, with all\nthe omissions and contrdictions,the names of A- Goldi, A-Shailu\n@Shailendra, A-Ramjane, A-Machchi can be extracted as the\npersons who were present on the spot, however so far as the A-\nRanjeet, A-Inder, A-Vikram, A-Sonu@ JK, and Jitendra @JD are\nconcerned, their presence is rather doubtful.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">21]   PW/4 Sona happens to be the wife of the deceased Bablu @\nNarendra. She is the second person to have witnessed the entire\nincident in front of her eyes. In her statement recorded<a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_17\"> u/s.161</a> of\nCr.P.C., she has only named A-Shailu and his friends but in court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                     19</span>\n\nshe has deposed that she knows the appellants who were present in\nthe Court and has correctly identified them, and in addition, it is\nalso mentioned by her that there was one more boy who had come\non the said night whose name is Goldi who is not present in the\nCourt. She has specifically identified Shailu @ Shailendra, Machchi\nand Jitendra. She has also stated that her husband was dragged out\nof the house and at that time, her brother-in-law Manoj also came to\nthe spot but after seeing him, accused persons ran after him and he\nran away from the spot to his house and thereafter her father-in-law\nand other family members also came to the spot and at that time the\naccused persons ran away. She has also been cross examined by the\ndefence regarding her religion, that she belongs to Muslim\ncommunity to which she has denied. She has also admitted that on\nthe date when the incident took place, her husband also had a\ndispute with the accused persons in the evening. She has admitted\nthat in her police statement, she has not mentioned the name of JD\n@ Jitendra and Machchi because she did not know their names at\nthat time because she was in a state of shock and was crying. She\nhas admitted that the police has not identified JD @ Jitendra,\nMachchi and Goldi through her. In para 10 of her cross examination\nfor appellant Machchi @ Amardeep, she has admitted that she\nknows Machchi @ Sunil who roams around the colony and has\nfeigned ignorance that at the time of giving police statement,\nwhether she has mentioned that Machchi @ Amardeep was holding\na belt or not. She has admitted that she does not know that whether\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                       20</span>\n\nMachchi&#x27;s name is Amardeep or Sunil but she knows him to be\nMachchi only and she has also feigned ignorance as to why in her\npolice statement, the name of Machchi @ Amardeep is not\nmentioned as one of the assailants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">22]   On behalf of appellant Sunil @ Ramjane also, she has been\nsuggested that she is from Muslim community, to which, she had\ndenied as she has mentioned the name of her father to be\nAmarsingh. She has admitted that her marriage with deceased\nNarendra was solemnized around 2 years ago and they were\nresiding at Mukharji Nagar and she does not know as to who are her\nneighbours. In para 17, she has admitted that the door was not\ntotally broken but only its latch was broken. She has admitted that\nshe did not see Shailu firing upon her husband. In para 20 in her\ncross examination on behalf of appellant accused Ranjeet, she has\nbeen asked about her brother-in-law Manoj&#x27;s presence on the spot\nthat he came running to the spot from his house and thereafter the\naccused persons also started running after him and her brother-in-\nlaw ran for his house which fact is not mentioned in her police\nstatement. This witness has been cross examined to suggest that\nManoj was also not present on the spot when the incident took place\nwhich is also apparent from the police statement of this witness in\nwhich she has not mentioned the name of Manoj and that the\naccused persons ran after him. She has also been suggested that she\nhas mentioned the names of all those persons whose name she\nremembers. She was also not sure as to how many people came to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                     21</span>\n\nassault her husband. She has also been suggested that her husband\nwas murdered by some persons on the street and thereafter a false\ncomplaint has been made against the accused persons. She has also\nadmitted that the accused persons were not identified by her either\nin jail or any other place. In para 28, she has again identified the\nappellant Goldi, Inder and Vikram. She has also stated that Goldi\nhad assaulted the deceased, her husband with a sword and the said\nthree accused persons had also assaulted her husband in front of her\nand the appellant Goldi had a sword whereas the appellant Vikram\nand Inder were having iron rods in their hands. In para 30, she has\nadmitted that presently her husband&#x27;s name of Naushad Kureshi\nwith whom she has solemnized Nikah and in Nikah, she has\nmentioned her name to be Ramzan Bee which is her name from her\nchildhood only.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">23]   On behalf of appellant Goldi, she has been cross examined\nthat she has not mentioned the name of Goldi in her police\nstatement or that he assaulted with a sword, to which she has\nfeigned ignorance. She has also been suggested that her husband&#x27;s\nmurder has been committed only because of her marriage with him\nas prior to her marriage with the deceased Bablu, she used to reside\nwith some other person and now she is deliberately not naming the\nactual accused persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">24]   PW/1 Vikram happens to be the father of the deceased who\nreached on the spot as his other son Pw/6 Manoj, who had gone to\nmeet some relatives, was coming towards his home in the night and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                       22</span>\n\nfound that the appellants were assaulting Narendra @ Bablu. In his\ndeposition, PW/1 Vikram has named Goldi, Ramjane, Machchi @\nAmardeep, Jitendra, Pappi, Ranjeet, Jacky @ Salman as the persons\nwho were present on the spot armed with various weapons and\nwhen he and the other persons residing nearby tried to save the\ndeceased, the accused persons ran away from the spot. He has also\nstated that while leaving the spot, Shailu was also saying that\nNarendra is trying to be a big boss in the locality and he needs to be\nfinished. This witness has also stated that he accompanied Bablu to\nthe M.Y. Hospital along withPw/.. Manoj and Pw/5 Tinu @ Sanjay\nwhere he was declared as dead. This witness has not been able to\nidentify Sunil @ Ramjane to whom he has identified as K.D. @\nJitendra, however, he has identified Machchi @ Amardeep, Shailu,\nK.D. @ Jitendra, Hanuman and Sonu. One other accused Vijay\nSingh has been identified by him by his aliases Pappi. Similarly,\nRanjeet has also been correctly identified by him. He has also stated\nthat accused Goldi who is not present is in juvenile Court. In the\ncross-examination, this witness has admitted that he and his son\nBablu, the deceased have already faced externment proceedings and\nhe has also been arrested under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/190229/\" id=\"a_18\">National Security\nAct</a> and also that his son used to run a grocery shop in addition to\ncommission of crimes. He has admitted that it takes around 2-4\nminutes to reach from his house to the house of the deceased. He\nhas admitted that he did not see Shailu firing the pistol and has also\nadmitted that the body of the deceased also had no gunshot injury,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                       23</span>\n\nhowever, he has stated that on his forehead, he saw an injury caused\nby the butt of the gun. He has admitted that he knows the appellant\nShailu for many years and has also admitted that one day prior to\nthe incident, Shailu had a dispute with the deceased and his sons\nNarendra, Manoj and Nitesh who had also assaulted Shailu at that\ntime for which, Shailu had also lodged a report. He has denied that\nat the time of incident, Shailu was not present on the spot.\n25]   PW/6 Manoj is the brother of the deceased who arrived on\nthe spot at the time of the incident, and as they (PW/1 Vikram and\nSanjay PW/6 Manoj) took the deceased Bablu to the hospital they\nwere accompanied by Pw/5 Sanjay. From the depositions of these\nthree witnesses it is also clear that they also went to the police\nstation to lodged the report which was lodged by Pw/6 Sanjay. It is\nalso suggested to them that they also talked about the assailants in\nthe hospital but when the FIR was lodged by Pw/6 Sanjay, they did\nnot mention the names of other accused persons&#x27; presence apart\nfrom A- Goldi, A-Shailu @Shailendra, A-Ramjane and A-Machchi\nthis is despite the fact that they also knew them from before.\nAdmittedly, no test identification parade has been conducted to\nestablish the identity of the accused persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">26]   In such circumstances, the question that falls for the\nconsideration of this court is whether the other accused persons,\nother than those whose names are disclosed in the FIR were also\ninvolved in the case? On a close scrutiny of the depositions of\nPw/1 Vikram, Pw/4 Sona, Pw/5 Sanjay and Pw/6 Manoj, this court\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                     24</span>\n\nis unable to come to a conclusion that the presence of A- Goldi, A-\nShailu @Shailendra, A-Ramjane and A-Machchi is established by\nthe prosecution to be beyond reasonable doubt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">27]   PW/3 Sanni and Pw/14 Suman happen to be the cousin of the\ndeceased Bablu @ Narendra and his mother respectively. They also\nclaim to reach on the spot at the time when it was taking place, and\nhave claimed to have seen the accused persons committing the\ncrime, but in the light of the testimonies of Pw/1 Vikram, Pw/4\nSona, Pw/5 Sanjay and Pw/6 Manoj who are also similarly or better\nplaced to have witnessed the incident, their (Pw/3 and Pw/14&#x27;s)\ntestimonies do not inspire confidence as to the involvement of other\nappellants except A- Goldi, A-Shailu @Shailendra, A-Ramjane\nand A-Machchi. Pw/3 Sunny also appears to be a chance witness as\naccording to him, he was present at Mukhargi Nagar at his Mama\nVikram&#x27;s house and at around 12 - 12:15 am in the night, when he\nwas preparing his bed to go to sleep, at that time his Mama&#x27;s son\nManoj came running and informed that Bablu is being assaulted. In\nhis cross examination, he is suggested that there was no reason for\nhim to come to Vikram&#x27;s house who happens to be his Mama and\nthat he was not present in the area at the time when the incident\ntook place. Whereas, Pw/14 Suman has admitted in para 12 of her\ndeposition that she does not know the accused persons by their\nnames but from their faces but she has also not been subjected to\ntest identification and the mentioning of the names of all the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                          25</span>\n\naccused persons in her police statement also give reasonable doubt\nabout the veracity of their statement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">28]     Thus, from the aforesaid deposition, the presence of A-\nGoldi, A-Shailu @Shailendra, A-Ramjane and A-Machchi appears\napparent on the spot. So far as the identity of A-Amardeep\n@Macchi is concerned, that whether his name was Amardeep\n@Machhi or Sunil @ Machhi is concerned, this court is of the\nconsidered opinion that as this accused has been rightly identified\nby Pw/5 Sanjay, and was also named in the FIR by him, it is hardly\nof any use to the A-Amardeep @ Machhi to contend that his name\nis Sunil and not Amardeep.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">29]     Regarding the juvenility of A- Goldi is concerned, his\napplication M.Cr.C.No.11264/2021 has already been dismissed by\nthis court by a separate order.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">30]     The FSL report is also inconclusive as usual.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">31]     In such facts and circumstance of the case, this Court is of the\nconsidered opinion that the prosecution has been able to prove the\ncase of A- Goldi, A-Shailu @Shailendra, A-Ramjane and A-\nMachchi beyond reasonable doubt but so far as the A-Ranjeet, A-\nIndersingh, A-Vikram, A-JD@ Jitendra and A-Sonu@JK are\nconcerned, it has failed to establish their presence positively on the\nspot.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">32]     Resultantly,   the   conviction       of   A-   Goldi,   A-Shailu\n@Shailendra, A-Ramjane and A-Machchi is hereby affirmed\nwhereas, the conviction of A-Ranjeet, A-Indersingh, A-Vikram, A-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                           26</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_20\">      JD@ Jitendra and A-Sonu @ JK is hereby set aside and they are\n      acquitted of the charges levelled against them.

Appellants Jitendra and Sonu @ JK be\n      released forthwith if not required in any other case.\n      33]       Accordingly, Criminal Appeal No.158/2012 of appellant\n      Shailu @ Shailendra, Criminal Appeal No.187/2012 of appellant\n      Golu @ Goldi, Criminal Appeal No. 533/2012 of appellant Sunil\n      @ Ramjane are hereby dismissed. However, Criminal Appeal\n      No.167/2012 filed on behalf of appellants Amardeep @ Machchi\n      and Sonu@J.K. is partly allowed affirming the conviction of\n      appellant Amardeep and acquitting the appellant Sonu @ J.K. from\n      the charges levelled against him whereas, Criminal Appeal\n      No.128/2012 of appellant Ranjeet Singh, Criminal Appeal\n      No.129/2012 of appellants Inder Singh and Vikram, Criminal\n      Appeal No.247/2012 of appellant Jitendra are hereby allowed.\n</p>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_3\">            (SUBODH ABHYANKAR)          (SATYENDRA KUMAR SINGH)\n                  JUDGE                          JUDGE\n\n      krjoshi\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">Digitally signed by KHEMRAJ JOSHI</span>\nDate: 2022.06.23 16:17:56 +05&#x27;30&#x27;\n</pre><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\"> </span>","numcites":11,"numcitedby":13,"docsource":"Madhya Pradesh High Court","citetid":132792851,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"chance  witness","formInput":"chance%20%20witness"},{"value":"fsl report","formInput":"fsl%20report"},{"value":"302/149 of IPC ","formInput":"302/149%20of%20IPC%20"},{"value":"\"chance witness\"","formInput":"%22chance%20witness%22"},{"value":"beltings","formInput":"beltings"},{"value":"further information is not fir","formInput":"further%20information%20is%20not%20fir"},{"value":"indore","formInput":"indore"},{"value":"\"police statement\"","formInput":"%22police%20statement%22"},{"value":"\"bablu\"","formInput":"%22bablu%22"},{"value":"police statements","formInput":"police%20statements"},{"value":"dragged","formInput":"dragged"},{"value":"ipc 149","formInput":"ipc%20149"},{"value":"sonu","formInput":"sonu"},{"value":"external","formInput":"external"},{"value":"149 i.p.c","formInput":"149%20i.p.c"},{"value":"fir lodged ","formInput":"fir%20lodged%20"}],"cats":[{"value":"indian-penal-code","formInput":"tag:indian-penal-code"},{"value":"national-security","formInput":"tag:national-security"},{"value":"unlawful-assembly","formInput":"tag:unlawful-assembly"},{"value":"arms","formInput":"tag:arms"},{"value":"examination-of-witnesses","formInput":"tag:examination-of-witnesses"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
