By the impugned judgment dated 1st April, 2009, the appellant\nLalit Kumar @ Sonu has been convicted under Section 376 Part I of the\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_1\">Indian Penal Code</a>, 1860 (hereinafter referred to as <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>, for short). By\nthe impugned order on sentence dated 13th April, 2009, the appellant has\nbeen sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for ten years and\ndirected to pay fine of Rs.2,000/- and in default of payment of fine to\nundergo simple imprisonment of six months.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2.    On the question whether the prosecutrix was subjected to rape on\n5th September, 2005, the testimony of the prosecutrix who had appeared\nas PW-6 and PW-3, Dr. Swati Kochhar clinches the issue. PW-3, Dr.\nSwati Kochhar has stated that she had examined the prosecutrix at about\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 711/2009                                       Page 1\n 9 a.m. when she had been brought before her with the alleged history of\nrape at 6 a.m. The prosecutrix had a history of bleeding and pain in the\nabdomen for two hours. There was history of trauma in the left eye. On\nlocal examination, PW-3, Dr. Swati Kochhar found the hymen to be\nabsent and there was 0.5 cm vaginal abrasion, which means a tear in the\nvagina which is possible due to forceful sexual intercourse. There was\nbleeding from the vagina. In addition, PW-3 Dr. Swati Kochhar has\nstated that the prosecutirx was bleeding from rectum, which indicates\nthat there was possible forceful intercourse, which had led to an internal\ninjury causing bleeding from the rectum. PW-3, Dr. Swati Kochhar has\nstated that she took vaginal smears, which were sealed and handed over\nto Head Constable Hoshiar Singh. In the report of the Forensic Science\nLaboratory Exhibit PW-12/ C and D, it is stated that human semen was\ndetected on the said vaginal swabs, which were marked 1a and 1b.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.    The statement of prosecutrix PW-6 was recorded without oath by\nthe trial court. The prosecutrix is a rag picker and as per her statement,\nshe was only seven years old at the time of the incident and when her\nstatement was recorded in the court. However, as per the ossification\nreport Exhibit PW-4/A, the age of the prosecutrix was between 10.2 to\n14.5 years. Before recording her statement, learned Additonal Sessions\nJudge had taken precaution to make the prosecutrix at ease and to satisfy\nhimself whether she can make a statement. The prosecutrix in her\nstatement has stated that on 5th September, 2005 at 5.30 a.m. in the\nmorning she had gone out to pick up waste paper when she met a person,\nwho told her that he can give her a bottle. The prosecutrix declined but\nthe person closed her mouth and took her behind the shop of the painter.\nThereafter, he took off her clothes. When the prosecutrix protested, she\nwas repeatedly slapped and her eye turned red. He had forced sexual\nintercourse with her and she started bleeding. She went back to her\nmother and narrated the incident. Mother of the prosecutrix called the\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 711/2009                                        Page 2\n police and she was taken to the hospital.         The statement by the\nprosecutrix before the police is marked Exhibit PW-6/A. She has also\nstated that after making the statement, she took the police to the spot\nwhere she had been raped and they collected a „durrie‟ as well as the\nunderwear of the prosecutrix from the spot. The prosecutrix identified\nher underwear as well as the „durrie‟, which were marked Exhibit PW-\n1/2 and Exhibit PW-1/1.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">4.    Learned counsel for the appellant submitted that there are\ncontradictions in the statement of the prosecutrix as in her statement\nbefore the police under <a href=\"/doc/48127346/\" id=\"a_3\">section 161</a> IPC, Exhibit PW-6/A the prosecutrix\nhad stated that rape was committed inside the paint shop but in her\nstatement in the court the prosecutrix had stated that she was taken\nbehind the paint shop. It was argued that the colour of the underwear was\nnot red but dark orange and the colour of the „durrie‟ was cream, blue\nand orange colour stripes and not white as stated by the prosecutrix in the\nExhibit PW-6/A. These so-called differences or discrepancies are minor\nand not material. The prosecutrix is a minor girl who was illiterate and\nmerely a rag picker. She may not clearly understand the difference\nbetween the colours like deep orange or dark orange and red. Similarly,\nwith regard to the colour of the durrie, this is merely a description given\nby a small minor girl. On the basis of the statement of the prosecutrix a\nsite plan ExPW-12/B was prepared and the place/shop was identified.\nKeeping in view the age of the prosecutrix, her statement in the court\nthat rape was committed, the discrepancy whether rape was committed\nbehind the paint shop or inside the paint shop cannot be regarded as a\ndiscrepancy which affects and creates doubt regarding her testimony.\nBehind the paint shop could also mean the back portion of the shop.\nLearned counsel for the appellant submitted that the prosecutrix was not\nable to tell date and time in the court and she did not know how to read\ntime. It was accordingly submitted that the prosecutrix could not have\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 711/2009                                         Page 3\n stated that she had got up at 5.30 a.m. or 6 a.m. on 5 th September, 2005\nand had gone out to pick rags/paper. It is not possible to accept the said\ncontention. It is a common knowledge that rag pickers are normally out\non the streets early in the morning. She must have been woken up to go\nout to pick rags, which is the usual practice.      The statement of the\nprosecutrix that she had left to pick rags at about 5.30/6 a.m. in the\nmorning, therefore, cannot be disputed. The factum of sexual intercourse\nor rape is confirmed by the statement of the PW-3, Dr. Swati Kochhar,\nSenior Resident, AIIMS, who had examined the prosecutrix at 9 a.m. on\nthe same day itself. In view of the statement of the prosecutrix, the\nmedical record and the statement of the PW-3, Dr. Swati Kochhar, there\nis ample evidence on record to show and establish that the prosecutrix\nhad been subjected to brutal and forced sexual intercourse or rape on the\nsame day. The fact that the blood was not detected by the Forensic\nScience Laboratory on the underwear is not fatal to the prosecution case\nin view of the said evidence in form of statement of PW-3, Dr. Swati\nKochhar, who has proved on record the MLC of the prosecutrix\nimmediately after the incident.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"912813\" id=\"span_1\">5.    The next question which arises for consideration is whether the\nappellant herein has committed the said offence. It is pointed out that the\nappellant was arrested on 12th September, 2005, nearly seven days after\nthe said incident. Learned counsel for the appellant has also drawn my\nattention to the Forensic Science Laboratory report Exhibit PW-12/C and\nit is pointed out that semen could not be detected on his vest. He also\nsubmits that identification of the appellant made by the prosecutrix in the\ncourt should not be relied upon. With regard to the appellant‟s refusal to\njoin Test Identification Parade (TIP, for short), learned counsel has relied\nupon <a href=\"/doc/912813/\" id=\"a_4\">Tain Singh versus State (Delhi Administration</a>), 1987 Crl.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1200711\" id=\"span_2\">L.J. 53,\nParmod Kumar versus State, 1990 <a href=\"/doc/1200711/\" id=\"a_5\">Crl.L.J. 68 and State of Himachal\nPradesh versus Lekh Raj</a>, 2000 Crl. L.J. 44. It is submitted that as per\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 711/2009                                          Page 4\n the prosecution case, the appellant was arrested on secret information but\nthe secret informer was not produced in the court.</span>        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"49111658\" id=\"span_3\">Therefore, the\nappellant is entitled to acquittal and in this regard relies upon <a href=\"/doc/49111658/\" id=\"a_6\">Surender\nversus State, Criminal Appeal No.</a> 21/1994, decided on 3rd July, 2009.</span>\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"461845\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1137765\" id=\"span_5\">He further submits that the statement of the prosecutrix should not be\nrelied and believed and in this connection reliance is placed on <a href=\"/doc/1137765/\" id=\"a_7\">Dinesh\nJaiswal versus State of Madhya Pradesh</a>, (<a href=\"/doc/461845/\" id=\"a_8\">2010) 3 SCC 232 and\nPandurang Sitaram Bhagwat versus State of Maharashtra</a>, (2005) 9\nSCC 44.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">6.    The appellant herein is son of a sweet maker, who had a shop in\nthe said area. The shop has been identified and marked in the site plan\nExhibit PW-12/B. The site plan also identifies the place where the\nprosecutrix was raped, i.e., the paint shop. PW-12 is ASI Surekha, who\nwas the first Investigating Officer, had arrested the appellant on 12th\nSeptember, 2005 after receiving secret information from Constable Ram\nGopal. In her cross-examination, she has stated that the prosecutrix had\ngiven description of the accused though she has not given the tentative\nage or the height of the suspect. They had detained two-three persons on\nsuspicion and interrogated them. These persons were later let off. After\nthe accused was arrested on 12th September, 2005, an application was\nmoved for conducting TIP on same day itself. TIP was in fact held on\n17th September, 2005 in the presence of Ms. Barkha Gupta, M.M., who\nhas appeared as PW-11. The appellant refused to join the TIP and had\nstated that the police had shown him to the witnesses and had also taken\nhis photographs. He had also alleged that the police officers had not\ncovered his face when he was being produced in the court and had shown\nhim to the witnesses. The prosecutrix had identified the appellant in the\ncourt as the person who had committed the offence.           This fact is\nspecifically mentioned in the examination-in-chief.        In the cross-\nexamination she has denied that the accused had not committed the said\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 711/2009                                        Page 5\n act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">7.     Be that as it may, no suggestion was given to the prosecutrix that\nshe was shown photographs of the appellant or was shown the appellant\nat the time of the arrest. Even in his statement, under <a href=\"/doc/140515/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 313</a>, the\nappellant did not state that he was shown to the prosecutrix at the time of\narrest or thereafter. In these circumstances, I think the recognition of the\nappellant by the prosecutrix in the court when her statement was\nrecorded on oath should be accepted under <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 9</a> of the Evidence\nAct, 1872 <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_11\">(Evidence Act</a>, for short). Identity of the accused is a relevant\nfact as per the said Section and the testimony of the witnesses before a\ncourt is substantive evidence. TIP belongs to investigation stage and is\nrelied for the purpose of corroboration. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1102670\" id=\"span_6\">The purpose of TIP is to test and\nstrengthen the trustworthiness of the substantive evidence in the court.\nTIP is held under the supervision of a Magistrate to eliminate any\nsuspicion or unfairness and to reduce chances of testimonial error. The\nimportance of identification of the accused in the court, the TIP\nproceedings, and the refusal of the accused to join the TIP proceedings\nand in which cases and when adverse inference can be drawn, has been\nsubject matter of several decisions. The Supreme Court has held in the\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/1102670/\" id=\"a_12\">Munshi Singh Gautam versus State of MP</a>, (2005) 9 SCC 631\nthat substantive evidence is the evidence of identification in the court.\nTIP is conducted during investigation stage to eliminate the possibility of\nthe accused being shown to the witness prior to his evidence being\nrecorded in the court. The purpose of prior identification is to test and\nstrengthen the trustworthiness of the evidence recorded in court. It is a\nsafe rule of prudence to generally look for corroboration of the sworn\ntestimony of witness in court. But in an appropriate case dock\nidentification can be relied upon without corroboration.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">8.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1515299\" id=\"span_7\">In <a href=\"/doc/1515299/\" id=\"a_13\">Sidhartha Vashisht @ Manu Sharma versus State (NCT of\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO.</a> 711/2009                                          Page 6\n Delhi), (2010) 6 SCC 1, the Supreme Court noticed the importance of\nTIP and logic behind it. It is the practice not borne out of procedure but\nout of prudence. In this case the Supreme Court has exhaustively\nexamined the entire case law on the subject. It was observed:-</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                &quot;254. Even a TIP before a Magistrate is otherwise hit\n           by <a href=\"/doc/1762984/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 162</a> of the Code. Therefore to say that a photo\n           identification is hit by <a href=\"/doc/1762984/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 162</a> is wrong. It is not a\n           substantive piece of evidence. It is only by virtue of\n           <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 9</a> of the Evidence Act that the same i.e. the act of\n           identification becomes admissible in court. The logic\n           behind TIP, which will include photo identification lies in\n           the fact that it is only an aid to investigation, where an\n           accused is not known to the witnesses, the IO conducts a\n           TIP to ensure that he has got the right person as an\n           accused. The practice is not borne out of procedure, but out\n           of prudence. At best it can be brought under <a href=\"/doc/482978/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 8</a> of\n           the Evidence Act, as evidence of conduct of a witness in\n           photo identifying the accused in the presence of an IO or\n           the Magistrate, during the course of an investigation.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">   9.

State</a>\n           ofU.P.2 identification tests do not constitute substantive\n           evidence. They are primarily meant for the purpose of\n           helping the investigating agency with an assurance that\n           their progress with the investigation into the offence is\n           proceeding on the right lines. The identification can only\n           be used as corroborative of the statement in court.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"56524\" id=\"span_10\">(See\n           <a href=\"/doc/56524/\" id=\"a_20\">Santokh Singh v. Izhar Hussain3</a>.) The necessity for\n           holding an identification parade can arise only when the\n           accused are not previously known to the witnesses. The\n           whole idea of a test identification parade is that witnesses\n           who claim to have seen the culprits at the time of\n           occurrence are to identify them from the midst of other\n           persons without any aid or any other source. The test is\n           done to check upon their veracity. In other words, the main\n\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 711/2009                                              Page 7\n            object of holding an identification parade, during the\n           investigation stage, is to test the memory of the witnesses\n           based upon first impression and also to enable the\n           prosecution to decide whether all or any of them could be\n           cited as eyewitnesses of the crime. The identification\n           proceedings are in the nature of tests and significantly,\n           therefore, there is no provision for it in the Code and the\n           Evidence Act. It is desirable that a test identification\n           parade should be conducted as soon as after the arrest of\n           the accused. This becomes necessary to eliminate the\n           possibility of the accused being shown to the witnesses\n           prior to the test identification parade. This is a very\n           common plea of the accused and, therefore, the prosecution\n           has to be cautious to ensure that there is no scope for\n           making such an allegation. If, however, circumstances are\n           beyond control and there is some delay, it cannot be said to\n           be fatal to the prosecution.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                17. It is trite to say that the substantive evidence is the\n           evidence of identification in court. Apart from the clear\n           provisions of <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 9</a> of the Evidence Act, the position in\n           law is well settled by a catena of decisions of this Court.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">           The facts, which establish the identity of the accused\n           persons, are relevant under <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 9</a> of the Evidence Act.\n           As a general rule, the substantive evidence of a witness is\n           the statement made in court. The evidence of mere\n           identification of the accused person at the trial for the first\n           time is from its very nature inherently of a weak character.\n           The purpose of a prior test identification, therefore, is to\n           test and strengthen the trustworthiness of that evidence. It\n           is, accordingly, considered a safe rule of prudence to\n           generally look for corroboration of the sworn testimony of\n           witnesses in court as to the identity of the accused who are\n           strangers to them, in the form of earlier identification\n           proceedings. This rule of prudence, however, is subject to\n           exceptions, when, for example, the court is impressed by a\n           particular witness on whose testimony it can safely rely,\n           without such or other corroboration. The identification\n           parades belong to the stage of investigation, and there is no\n           provision in the Code which obliges the investigating\n           agency to hold or confers a right upon the accused to claim\n           a test identification parade. They do not constitute\n           substantive evidence and these parades are essentially\n           governed by <a href=\"/doc/1762984/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 162</a> of the Code. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"312114\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117134\" id=\"span_12\">Failure to hold a test\n           identification parade would not make inadmissible the\n           evidence of identification in court.

In view of this corroborative evidence we find no\n           substance in the argument urged on behalf of the appellant\n           that the investigating officer ought to have held an\n           identification parade and that the failure of Munshi Ram to\n           mention the names of the two accused to the neighbours\n           who came to the scene immediately after the occurrence\n           shows that his story cannot be true.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1956474\" id=\"span_14\">As observed by this\n           Court in <a href=\"/doc/1956474/\" id=\"a_27\">Jadunath Singh v.

The fact that Munshi\n           Ram did not disclose the names of the two accused to the\n           villagers only shows that the accused were not previously\n           known to him and the story that the accused referred to\n           each other by their respective names during the course of\n           the incident contains an element of exaggeration.

Earlier the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1484068/\" id=\"a_29\">Munna versus State (NCT of\nDelhi</a>), (2003) 10 SCC 599 had examined the question of refusal of an\naccused to participate in the TIP and effect thereof in case the said\naccused is identified by a witness in the court. It was observed where an\naccused declines to participate in the TIP, the prosecution has no option\nbut to proceed with dock identification. In the said case, the Supreme\nCourt relied upon the statement of the prosecutrix in the witness box in\nwhich she had identified the accused. The accused had refused to join\nTIP and had also given some explanation in the statement under Section\n313 but the Supreme Court was not inclined to accept the said\nexplanation and held:-</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                     &quot;8.

The substantive evidence of\n             a witness is the statement in court but as a rule of\n             prudence, earlier identification proceedings are held in\n             order to corroborate the testimony of a witness given in\n             court as regards the identity of the accused who is not\n             known to him from before. However, this normal rule can\n             have no application in the present case on account of own\n             conduct of the appellant. The investigating officer\n             produced appellant Munna &quot;baparda&quot; (with his face\n             muffled) in the Court of Metropolitan Magistrate on 15-\n             2-1992 and an application was given praying that\n             necessary orders be passed for holding his test\n             identification parade. It was mentioned in the application\n             that after his arrest Munna had been kept &quot;baparda&quot; and\n             is being produced in court in that condition. However, the\n             appellant categorically refused to participate in a test\n             identification     parade.   Thereafter,     the   learned\n             Metropolitan Magistrate passed the following order:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                     &quot;Accused Munna in muffled face in police\n             custody is produced and identified before me by SI Satya\n             Pal, PS Roop Nagar. The accused was questioned\n             whether he wanted to join test identification parade. He\n             refused to join. He is warned that his refusal to join TIP\n             may be interpreted in evidence against him. Still he does\n             not want to participate in TIP. Let his statement be\n             recorded.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">                     9. Thereafter, the statement of appellant Munna\n             was recorded where he stated that he did not want to\n             participate in the test identification parade because the\n             witnesses had already seen him in the police station.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">                     10. In a case where an accused himself refuses to\n             participate in a test identification parade, it is not open to\n             him to contend that the statement of the eyewitnesses\n             made for the first time in court, wherein they specifically\n             point towards him as a person who had taken part in the\n             commission of the crime, should not be relied upon. This\n             plea is available provided the prosecution is itself\n             responsible for not holding a test identification parade.\n             However, in a case where the accused himself declines to\n             participate in a test identification parade, the prosecution\n             has no option but to proceed in a normal manner like all\n             other cases and rely upon the testimony of the witnesses,\n             which is recorded in court during the course of the trial of\n             the case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">                      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1653286\" id=\"span_16\">11. The effect of not holding a prior test\n             identification parade has been recently examined in\n             considerable detail by a three-Judge Bench in\n             <a href=\"/doc/1653286/\" id=\"a_30\">Malkhansingh v. State of M.P.1</a> and after review of\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 711/2009                                                  Page 10\n              practically all the earlier decisions, it has been held as\n             under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                      &quot;7. It is trite to say that the substantive evidence\n             is the evidence of identification in court. Apart from the\n             clear provisions of <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 9</a> of the Evidence Act, the\n             position in law is well settled by a catena of decisions of\n             this Court. The facts, which establish the identity of the\n             accused persons, are relevant under <a href=\"/doc/529244/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 9</a> of the\n             Evidence Act. As a general rule, the substantive evidence\n             of a witness is the statement made in court. The evidence\n             of mere identification of the accused person at the trial\n             for the first time is from its very nature inherently of a\n             weak character. The purpose of a prior test identification,\n             therefore, is to test and strengthen the trustworthiness of\n             that evidence. It is accordingly considered a safe rule of\n             prudence to generally look for corroboration of the sworn\n             testimony of witnesses in court as to the identity of the\n             accused who are strangers to them, in the form of earlier\n             identification proceedings. This rule of prudence,\n             however, is subject to exceptions, when, for example, the\n             court is impressed by a particular witness on whose\n             testimony it can safely rely, without such or other\n             corroboration. The identification parades belong to the\n             stage of investigation, and there is no provision in the\n             <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_33\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> which obliges the\n             investigating agency to hold, or confers a right upon the\n             accused to claim a test identification parade. ... Failure to\n             hold a test identification parade would not make\n             inadmissible the evidence of identification in court. The\n             weight to be attached to such identification should be a\n             matter for the courts of fact.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                       &quot;10. It is no doubt true that much evidentiary\n             value cannot be attached to the identification of the\n             accused in court where identifying witness is a total\n             stranger who had just a fleeting glimpse of the person\n             identified or who had no particular reason to remember\n             the person concerned, if the identification is made for the\n             first time in court.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                       &quot;[T]he substantive evidence is the evidence of\n             identification in court and the test identification parade\n             provides corroboration to the identification of the witness\n             in court, if required. However, what weight must be\n             attached to the evidence of identification in court, which\n             is not preceded by a test identification parade, is a matter\n             for the courts of fact to examine.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1277706\" id=\"span_17\">11.     Recently, Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1277706/\" id=\"a_34\">Mulla and Another versus State of\nUttar Pradesh</a>, (2010) 3 SCC 508 examined the question of TIP and\n\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 711/2009                                                 Page 11\n observed that the same are for the purpose of helping the investigating\nagencies to ensure that the suspect is the same person who the witness\nhad seen in connection with the said occurrence/incident. Failure to hold\nTIP does not make the evidence of identification in the court\ninadmissible, rather the same is very much admissible in law but can\naffect its credibility. It was also observed that it is a common plea of the\naccused that they have been shown to the witnesses.                      Prosecution,\ntherefore, should be conscious to ensure that TIP is conducted\nexpeditiously. After examining the case law on the subject, it was\nobserved as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">              &quot;55.     The identification parades are not primarily meant\n              for the court. They are meant for investigation purposes.\n              The object of conducting a test identification parade is two\n              fold. First is to enable the witnesses to satisfy themselves\n              that the accused whom they suspect is really the one who\n              was seen by them in connection with the commission of the\n              crime. Second is to satisfy the investigating authorities that\n              the suspect is the real person whom the witnesses had seen in\n              connection with the said occurrence.           Therefore, the\n              following principles regarding identification parade emerge:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">          (1) an identification parade ideally must be conducted as soon as\n              possible to avoid any mistake on the part of witnesses;\n          (2) this condition can be revoked if proper explanation justifying\n              the delay is provided; and\n          (3) the authorities must make sure that the delay does not result\n              in exposure of the accused which may lead to mistakes on\n              the part of the witnesses.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">12.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"912813\" id=\"span_18\">In <a href=\"/doc/912813/\" id=\"a_35\">Tain Singh and Parmod Kumar</a> (supra)it has been observed\nthat the accused had relied upon cogent circumstances to establish the\nreasons why he declined to participate in the TIP and, therefore, no\nadverse inference was drawn on account of their refusal.

However, in the\npresent case the appellant refused to take part in the TIP. Therefore, the\nprosecution had no option but to ask the prosecutrix to identify the\nCRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 711/2009                                                   Page 12\n appellant in the court.
