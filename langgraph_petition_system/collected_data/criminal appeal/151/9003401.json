The prosecution&#x27;s case, in short, is that, on\n\n13.9.2004, the complainant Hiraman (P.W.1) had lodged an\n\nFIR, Ex.P/1 at Police Station Gadhwa (District-Sidhi) that in\n\nthe evening of previous day, Ramkali (P.W.3), daughter of the\n\ndeceased Harihar Singh came to his house at village Gerui\n\n(Police   Station   Gadhwa)     and         intimated            him        that        the\n\nappellants Laxan Dhari, Babloo Singh, Babulal Singh and\n\nRajkumar Singh had assaulted her father Harihar Singh\n\nwith sticks and he was lying in the house. Thereafter, the\n\ncomplainant Hiraman went to the house of the deceased\n\nHarihar Singh and met the deceased.                       He found that the\n\ndeceased had sustained several injuries, whereas Sonwati\n\n(P.W.2), wife of the deceased Harihar Singh had informed\n\nhim that on 12.9.2004, in the noon, Chhote Baiga (P.W.6),\n\nlessee of the deceased Harihar Singh was ploughing the field\n\nat village Gerui. The appellants prohibited him to plough the\n\nfield and they had abused him then, the deceased Harihar\n\nSingh came out of his house and told the appellants not to\n\nstop his lessee Chhote Baiga.               Thereafter, the appellants\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">                           -:- 3 -:-\n</p>                                                                                          \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                                            Criminal Appeal No.1220 of 2005\n                                            Criminal Appeal No.1227 of 2005\n\n\nstarted abusing the deceased Harihar Singh then, they\n\nstarted assaulting him by sticks.               On shouting, all the\n\nwitnesses Sonwati (P.W.2), Sobhnath Singh (P.W.8) and Shiv\n\nKumar (P.W.7) who were grazing their cattle nearby, rushed\n\nto the spot. Sonwati to save her husband, covered him by\n\nherself then, the appellants assaulted her also with sticks\n\nand as a result of which, she sustained six injuries on\n\nvarious parts of her body. The appellants left the spot when\n\nthey found that Harihar Singh was dead or unconscious.\n\nThe victim Sonwati took her husband Harihar Singh on a cot\n\nto her house with help of Laldhari (P.W.4) and Devnath\n\n(P.W.5). After hearing the entire narration of the story from\n\nvictim Sonwati, the complainant Hiraman told her that\n\npresently there was no arrangement for the treatment of the\n\ndeceased Harihar Singh and therefore, he would take him to\n\nthe city in the early morning.             However, on 13.9.2004,\n\nRamkali went to the house of Hiraman and informed him\n\nthat her father had expired. Hiraman went to the house of\n\nHarihar and saw his dead body. Thereafter, he went to the\n\nPolice Station Gadhwa and lodged the FIR.                            The police\n\nregistered a case and the dead body of the deceased Harihar\n\nSingh was sent for post-mortem to Community Health\n\nCenter, Chitrangi, where Dr.Harishankar Vaishya (P.W.15)\n\nhad performed the post-mortem on the body of the deceased\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                              -:- 4 -:-\n</blockquote>                                                                                             \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                                               Criminal Appeal No.1220 of 2005\n                                               Criminal Appeal No.1227 of 2005\n\n\nand gave his report, Ex.P/25. Dr.Vaishya found 14 injuries\n\nto the victim caused by hard and blunt object on various\n\nparts of body. He found that 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th and 7th ribs of\n\nright side of the deceased were broken and the left lung was\n\nalso ruptured and the deceased died due to such injuries,\n\nspecially due to rupture of his lung. He also examined the\n\nvictim Sonwati and gave his report, Ex.P/24-A. He found six\n\ninjuries to the victim Sonwati on various parts of her body\n\nincluding the hands, legs and back. After due investigation,\n\na charge-sheet was filed before the JMFC, Deosar, who\n\ncommitted the case to the Sessions Court and ultimately it\n\nwas transferred to the learned Second Additional Judge to\n\nthe First Additional Sessions Judge, Sidhi.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">4.           The appellants abjured their guilt.                    They did not\n\ntake any specific plea but, they had stated that they were\n\nfalsely implicated in the matter.                  However, no defence\n\nevidence was adduced.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">5.           After considering the prosecution&#x27;s evidence, the\n\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge, convicted and sentenced\n\nthe appellants as mentioned above.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">6.

However, his contention appears\n\nto be incorrect.     In the present case, there are 5 eye\n\nwitnesses.    Out of them, Chhote Baiga (P.W.6) has turned\n\nhostile, whereas, Sonwati (P.W.2), Ramkali (P.W.3), Shiv\n\nKumar (P.W.7) and Shobhnath Singh (P.W.8) have stated\n\nabout the incident and categorically alleged that the\n\nappellants assaulted the deceased Harihar Singh and the\n\nvictim Sonwati by sticks.            The learned counsel for the\n\nappellants has submitted that the witnesses did not try to\n\nsave   the    deceased    Harihar       Singh            and        therefore,            the\n\ntestimony of such chance witnesses cannot be accepted. The\n\ncontention     advanced    by     the        learned           counsel           for      the\n\nappellants appears to be related with the witnesses Shiv\n\nKumar (P.W.7) and Shobhnath (P.W.8) otherwise, the witness\n\nSonwati (P.W.2), wife of the deceased, not only tried to save\n\nher husband but, she also fell upon her husband and in\n\nreturn sustained six injuries on her body.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">8.           Shiv Kumar and Shobhnath have stated that at\n\nthe time of the incident, they were grazing cattle nearby the\n\nplace of incident and on hearing the outcry, they saw the\n\nincident.    Due to fear of the appellants, they did not visit\n\nnear to the deceased Harihar Singh. Their version is duly\n\nproved by their conduct that after the incident, Sonwati\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">                            -:- 6 -:-\n</blockquote>                                                                                           \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">                                             Criminal Appeal No.1220 of 2005\n                                             Criminal Appeal No.1227 of 2005\n\n\ncalled Laldhari (P.W.4) and Devnath (P.W.5) to take her\n\nhusband to her house.      The witnesses Shiv Kumar and\n\nShobhnath Singh did not assist Sonwati in taking her\n\nhusband to their house. If these witnesses were related or\n\ninterested with the deceased Harihar Singh then, they would\n\nhave helped the victim Sonwati in taking her husband to her\n\nhouse. Looking to the conduct of these witnesses, it would\n\nbe apparent that they were afraid of the appellants and\n\ntherefore, after seeing the entire incident, neither they\n\nintervened, nor they helped the victim Sonwati thereafter.\n\nHence, due to non-intervention of these witnesses during the\n\nincident, their testimony cannot be discarded.                              Sonwati\n\n(P.W.2) and Ramkali (P.W.3) have clearly stated about the\n\nincident and thereafter, Sonwati called Laldhari (P.W.4) and\n\nDevnath (P.W.5), who took the deceased on a cot to the\n\nhouse of Sonwati.   Laldhari and Devnath have also stated\n\nthat the victim Sonwati told about the incident to them and\n\nthey proved the first version about the incident as informed\n\nby Sonwati, which corroborates the testimony of the injured\n\nwitness Sonwati (P.W.2).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">9.       Also, Sonwati had sustained six injuries, which\n\ncould not be caused by her falling on Earth as suggested by\n\nthe defence counsel to Dr.Harishankar Vaishya (P.W.15) and\n\ntherefore, it would be apparent that the victim Sonwati was\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">                             -:- 7 -:-\n</blockquote>                                                                                            \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                                              Criminal Appeal No.1220 of 2005\n                                              Criminal Appeal No.1227 of 2005\n\n\nan injured witness and her testimony should be believed.\n\nThe witness Laldhari (P.W.4) has stated that when he\n\nreached to the spot, the witness Ramkali told about the\n\nentire incident and she was also present at the spot.\n\nHowever, Ramkali (P.W.3) has admitted in para 3 of her\n\ncross-examination that when she reached the spot, the\n\nassailants had already disappeared.                According to Ramkali\n\nherself, she reached to the spot soon after the incident and\n\nshe was not the eye witness.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">10.       The   learned   counsel          for      the       appellants             has\n\nsubmitted that FIR was not lodged within reasonable time\n\nand hence it cannot be believed. If the facts of this case are\n\nexamined according to the circumstances then, the deceased\n\nHarihar Singh was the only person in the family, who could\n\nmake arrangement of necessary things.                           And when he\n\nsustained the injuries, the victim Sonwati could take him to\n\nhis house with help of witnesses Devnath and Laldhari. He\n\ncalled Hiraman (P.W.1) and intimated him about the\n\nincident, so that an arrangement for treatment etc. of the\n\ndeceased may be done.       However, Hiraman expressed his\n\ninability to help her because, in the night, it was not possible\n\nfor him to arrange for the transportation of deceased Harihar\n\nSingh and ultimately, he succumbed to the injuries. After\n\nconsidering   the   evidence   given          by      Hiraman,             Sonwati,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">                            -:- 8 -:-\n</blockquote>                                                                                           \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                                             Criminal Appeal No.1220 of 2005\n                                             Criminal Appeal No.1227 of 2005\n\n\nLaldhari and Devnath, it would be apparent that the victim\n\nSonwati did not have any manual assistance to her except\n\nthe witness Hiraman.      Hiraman did not go to the police\n\nstation in the evening or night but, after death of the\n\ndeceased, he went to the police station and lodged the FIR.\n\nIf it was possible for Sonwati to take her injured husband to\n\nhospital for medical aid or she was in a position to get her\n\nown treatment then, certainly she could lodge the FIR soon\n\nafter the incident. Looking to the helplessness of the victim\n\nSonwati, FIR could be lodged on the next day and therefore,\n\nit cannot be held that the FIR was lodged with delay and it\n\nshould not be relied upon. The appellants could not show\n\nany enmity with the witness Hiraman, so that he would have\n\nlodged a false FIR against them.             He had lodged the FIR\n\nnarrating the facts as told by the victim Sonwati.                             Under\n\nsuch circumstances, looking to the conduct of Sonwati and\n\nHiraman, FIR, Ex.P/1 lodged by the complainant Hiraman\n\ncannot be discarded and it could be used as a corroborative\n\npiece of evidence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">11.

The      post-mortem              report          proved           by\n\nDr.Harishankar Vaishya corroborates the allegations made\n\nby the victim Sonwati (P.W.2) and other eye witnesses\n\nagainst the appellants.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">13.       There is no discrepancy in the statement of eye\n\nwitnesses, supporting witnesses and FIR, Ex.P/1 about the\n\nnames of the appellants.         Each eye witness has stated\n\nagainst all of the appellants.          Hiraman (P.W.1) has also\n\nstated that when he was called in the evening, he went to the\n\nhouse of the deceased Harihar Singh and met him. Harihar\n\nSingh told him about the assailants.

However, the complainant Hiraman (P.W.1)\n\nhas given an explanation that he informed the police about\n\nthe incident as told by Sonwati and therefore, he did not\n\ninform about the wordings told by the deceased to him.\n\nRamkali has also proved that Hiraman visited the house of\n\nthe deceased for two times.

As discussed above, there\n\nwas no reason to the witness Hiraman to tell something\n\nagainst the appellants and therefore, his testimony should\n\nbe believed. He is an illiterate villager and therefore, it was\n\npossible that he could not narrate the facts in detail to the\n\npolice at the time of lodging the FIR.                            Under such\n\ncircumstances, the oral dying declaration as proved by the\n\nwitness Hiraman also corroborates the testimony of the\n\nvictim Sonwati.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">14.       On the basis of the evidence advanced by the\n\nprosecution, the testimony of eye witnesses Sonwati (P.W.2),\n\nShiv   Kumar      (P.W.7)   and       Shobhnath                (P.W.8),          duly\n\ncorroborated by the FIR, Ex.P/1, the statements of witnesses\n\nLaldhari (P.W.4) and Devnath (P.W.5), post-mortem report,\n\nEx.P/25 and MLC report of the victim Sonwati, Ex.P/24-A as\n\nproved by Dr.Harishankar Vaishya (P.W.15) is believable and\n\ntherefore, the prosecution has succeeded to prove its case\n\nbeyond doubt against that appellants that each of them\n\nassaulted the deceased Harihar Singh with sticks and killed\n\nhim.   It is also proved beyond doubt that the appellants\n\nvoluntarily caused hurt to the victim Sonwati with sticks.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">15.

Sonwati (P.W.2) has stated that the deceased\n\nHarihar Singh was born from elder wife of one Rama Singh.\n\nHer father-in-law Rama Singh had 3-4 wives and the\n\naccused Babloo Singh was son of another wife of Rama\n\nSingh. Accused Laxan Dhari is cousin of the accused Babloo\n\nSingh.   Since there was a dispute of some property which\n\nwas let out to the witness Chhotte Baiga (P.W.6), the\n\nappellants were quarrelling with him. It is not denied by the\n\nappellants that they had enmity with the complainant due to\n\ndispute over land. Enmity is a double edged weapon. Due\n\nto enmity, one can assault his enemy or due to enmity,\n\nsomeone can implicate the enemy for an offence done by\n\nsomeone else. In the present case, soon after the incident,\n\nSonwati told the entire story to the witnesses Laldhari and\n\nDevnath and thereafter, she told the entire story to Hiraman\n\nin the evening.    It was not a case of robbery or crime\n\ncommitted by some unknown persons, so that the victim\n\ncould not identify the actual culprits. It is a case of broad\n\nday light and there was no dispute relating to identification.\n\nHence, there was no reason with the victim Sonwati to leave\n\nthe actual culprits and to falsely implicate the appellants.\n\nLooking to the number of injuries if she says that four\n\npersons (appellants) were the assailants then, her testimony\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">                           -:- 13 -:-\n</blockquote>                                                                                       \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">                                           Criminal Appeal No.1220 of 2005\n                                           Criminal Appeal No.1227 of 2005\n\n\nshould be believed.

In alternate, the learned counsel for the appellants\n\nhas submitted that there was no premeditation of mind to\n\nthe appellants.   The quarrel took place in the spur of\n\nmoment.

Some of the injuries were grave and the\n\nappellants had not intended to kill the deceased and\n\ntherefore, they could not be convicted for offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 302</a> of IPC.

It is true that the incident took place in a spur of\n\nmoment but, pre-meditation is a process of mind and a\n\nperson may make up his mind soon before the incident. If\n\nthe conduct of the appellants is examined in the present\n\ncase then, the appellants went to the field which was in\n\npossession of the deceased Harihar Singh and Chhote Baiga\n\nwas ploughing that field as a lessee of the deceased Harihar\n\nSingh.   The appellants started quarreling with the witness\n\nChhote Baiga and after hearing the noise, the deceased\n\nHarihar Singh also came out of the house.                          Under such\n\ncircumstances, it would be apparent that the appellants\n\nwere the aggressors, who went to the field fully armed with\n\nlathis. It is thus apparent that each of the appellants had\n\nparticipated in the crime.     The victim sustained few grave\n\ninjuries on non vital parts of the body as well as on the vital\n\npart (chest) of the body.     Various bones like right radius,\n\nright ulna and five different ribs were broken in the incident,\n\nwhich indicates that the appellants assaulted the deceased\n\nHarihar Singh in a forceful manner. Also, they continued to\n\nassault the deceased though he fell down on the Earth. They\n\nalso continued to assault the deceased when Sonwati\n\n(P.W.2), wife of the deceased fell upon him to save him.

The deceased Harihar Singh\n\nwas unarmed and all alone. If the appellants had intention\n\nonly to cause injuries to deceased Harihar Singh due to any\n\nprovocation they then, after giving 2-3 blows, would have\n\nstopped. But, the appellants not only gave powerful blows to\n\nthe deceased, they continued to give the blows even after he\n\nfell down on the field and also when the victim Sonwati laid\n\nupon the deceased to save him.           Sonwati had sustained 6\n\ninjuries which indicates that the appellants were interested\n\nto kill the deceased and therefore, they continued to give\n\nlathi blows to the victim Sonwati, so that she would leave her\n\nhusband and the appellants could assault him further.\n\nUnder such circumstances, if conduct of the appellants is\n\nconsidered as depicted by the circumstances and medical\n\nevidence that they caused 16 injuries to the deceased\n\nHarihar Singh, out of which, 7 injuries were grave, it is\n\nestablished by the prosecution that each of the appellants\n\nhad intended to kill the deceased Harihar Singh.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">18.

As it is observed that each of the appellants\n\nassaulted the deceased in a forceful and brutal manner\n\ntherefore, the common intention of the appellants was to kill\n\nthe deceased Harihar Singh and therefore, each of them is\n\nresponsible for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 302</a> of IPC with help of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 34</a> of IPC. Each of the appellant is responsible for\n\nthe crime committed by the co-appellants.                            Hence, the\n\nlearned Additional Sessions Judge has rightly convicted the\n\nappellants   for   offence   under        <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_14\">Section          302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_15\">34</a>          of     IPC.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">Similarly, it is proved beyond doubt that each of the\n\nappellants had voluntarily caused injuries to the victim\n\nSonwati and therefore, each of them is also guilty of offence\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 323</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_17\">34</a> of IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">20.
