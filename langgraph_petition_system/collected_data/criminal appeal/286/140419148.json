It   has   been \n\n\n\nemphasized   that   a   free   fight   postulated   that   both   sides   had \n\n\n\ncome  to do battle,  as  held  by  this Court  in  Gajanand &amp;  Ors. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">vs.   State   of   U.P.

In this \n\n\n\nview   of   the   matter,   the   defence   can   legitimately   raise   a \n\n\n\nsuspicion   that   the   genesis   of   the   incident   was   shrouded   in \n\n\n\nmystery   and   the   prosecution   had   suppressed   a   part   of   the \n\n\n\nproceeding.

It has also to be noticed \n\n\n\nthat   PW-3   Chottey   Lal,   one   of   the   injured   witnesses,   had \n\n\n\nadmitted in his cross examination that the quarrel had taken \n\n\n\nplace suddenly and that the rival groups were both saying that \n\n\f\n                                 Crl.

It   is   also              16</span>\n\n\nclear   from   the   evidence   that   injury   No.1   was   sufficient   to \n\n\n\ncause   death   in   the   normal   course   of   nature.     The   injuries \n\n\n\nattributed to the other three accused mentioned herein above \n\n\n\nwere simple in nature  and can, by  no  stretch of imagination, \n\n\n\nbe said to have been the cause of death.  In the light of the fact \n\n\n\nthat we are dealing with a case of a free fight, Asuddin, Mauj \n\n\n\nand   Rahmat   must   be   made   responsible   for   their   respective \n\n\n\ninjuries   and   Rahmat   had,   as   a   matter   of   fact,   died   while   the \n\n\n\nmatter   was   in   the   High   Court.     We   are,   therefore,   of   the \n\n\n\nopinion   that   in   so   far   as   Kallu   respondent   is   concerned,   his \n\n\n\nconviction   under   <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_59\">Section   304</a>   Part   II   of   the   <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_60\">IPC</a>   even   on   the \n\n\n\nfindings   recorded   by   the   High   Court,   was   erroneous.     We, \n\n\n\naccordingly,   allow   these   appeals   to   the   extent   that   Kallu   is \n\n\n\nheld guilty under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 302</a> of the IPC for having caused the \n\n\n\nmurder   of   Girdhari   and   we   restore   the   judgment   of   the   Trial \n\n\n\nCourt to this limited extent.  In so far as the other accused are \n\n\n\nconcerned, the appeals are dismissed.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">7.
