Sub- section (1) of Section\n\n     269- UD of the Income Tax Act, 1961 provided that on\n\n     an order for purchase by the Central Government of an\n\n     immovable property, the Central Government would be\n\n     liable to pay as compensation to the owner of the\n\n     property an amount equal to the amount of apparent\n\n     consideration and sub- section (1) of Section 269- UE\n\n     provided that in case an order for compulsory purchase\n\n     is made under sub- section (1) of Section 269- UD, the\n\n     property in respect of which the order is made shall\n\n     vest   in    the   Central    Government   free     from   all\n\n     encumbrances and sub- section (2) of Section 269- UE\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">\f                              13</span>\n\n\nfurther provided that the transferor or any other\n\nperson who may be in possession of the immovable\n\nproperty in respect of which an order under sub-\n\nsection (1) of Section 269- UD is made is required to\n\nsurrender or deliver possession of the property to the\n\nappropriate     authority     or    any     other    person      duly\n\nauthorised by the appropriate authority within fifteen\n\ndays of the service of the order on him.               This Court\n\nheld that if there is a lessee in occupation of the\n\nproperty concerned, his leasehold rights would be\n\ndestroyed      and   he     would   have      to    handover        the\n\npossession of the property to the appropriate authority\n\nor any other person nominated by the appropriate\n\nauthority and this clearly shows that an order for\n\ncompulsory purchase results in the leasehold rights\n\nbeing destroyed.

The first question that we have to decide is whether the\n\n      provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_82\">SARFAESI Act</a> have in any way\n\n      affected the right of a lessee to remain in possession of\n\f      the secured asset during the period of a lease.           A\n\n      ‘secured asset’ has been defined in <a href=\"/doc/93577912/\" id=\"a_83\">Section 2(zc)</a> of the\n\n      SARFAESI Act to mean the property on which the\n\n      security interest is created.     In case of an immovable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                               24</span>\n\n\n      property, a security interest is created in a secured\n\n      asset by way of a mortgage in favour of the secured\n\n      creditor.   There may be cases where before the\n\n      mortgage is created in          respect of an immovable\n\n      property, the borrower had already leased out the\n\n      immovable property in favour of a lessee either as the\n\n      owner or as a person competent or authorised to\n\n      transfer the immovable property in accordance with\n\n      <a href=\"/doc/1839218/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 7</a> of the Transfer of Property Act. If such a lease\n\n      is made, by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/1031695/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 8</a> of the Transfer of\n\n      Property Act, the lessee will have the right to enjoy the\n\n      leased property in accordance with the terms and\n\n      condition   of the   lease irrespective     of whether      a\n\n      subsequent mortgagee of the immovable property has\n\n      knowledge of such a lease or not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">12.   After the mortgage of an immovable property is created\n\n      by the borrower in favour of a secured creditor, the\n\n      right of the borrower to lease a mortgaged property is\n\n      regulated by <a href=\"/doc/1749243/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 65A</a> of the Transfer of Property\n\n      Act.   <a href=\"/doc/1749243/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 65A</a> of the Transfer of Property Act is\n\n      extracted hereinbelow:\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                     25</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">&quot;65A.

Thus, so long as the mortgage-deed\n\ndoes not prohibit a mortgagor from making a lease of the\n\nmortgaged property and so long as the lease satisfies the\n\nrequirements of sub- section (2) of Section 65A, a lease made\n\nby a borrower as a mortgagor will not only be valid but is\n\nalso binding on the secured creditor as a mortgagee.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">13.

We have already held that <a href=\"/doc/152603276/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 13</a> of the\n\nSARFAESI Act does not provide that the lease in respect of a\n\nsecured asset will get determined when the secured creditor\n\ndecides to take the measures in the said section.                Hence,\n\npossession of the secured asset from a lessee in lawful\n\npossession under a valid lease is not required to be taken\n\nunder the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_141\">SARFAESI Act</a> and the Chief\n\fMetropolitan Magistrate or the District Magistrate, therefore,\n\ndoes not have any power under <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 14</a> of the SARFAESI\n\nAct to take possession of the secured asset from such a\n\nlessee and hand over the same to the secured creditor.\n\nWhen,       therefore,   a secured         creditor   moves the     Chief\n\nMetropolitan      Magistrate   or    the      District   Magistrate    for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                44</span>\n\n\nassistance to take possession of the secured asset, he must\n\nstate in the affidavit accompanying the application that the\n\nsecured asset is not in possession of a lessee under the valid\n\nlease made prior to creation of the mortgage by the borrower\n\nor made in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/1749243/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 65A</a> of the Transfer of\n\nProperty Act prior to receipt of a notice under sub- section (2)\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/152603276/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 13</a> of the SARFAESI Act by the borrower.             We\n\nwould like to clarify that even in such cases where the\n\nsecured creditor is unable to take possession of the secured\n\nasset after expiry of the period 60 days of the notice to the\n\nborrower of the intention of the secured creditor to enforce\n\nthe secured asset to realize the secured debt, the secured\n\ncreditor will have the right to receive any money due or\n\nwhich may become due, including rent, from the lessee to\n\nthe borrower.     This will be clear from clause (d) of sub-\n\nsection (4) of <a href=\"/doc/152603276/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 13</a>, which provides that in case the\n\nborrower fails to discharge his liability in full within the\n\nnotice period, the secured creditor may require, at any time\n\nby notice in writing, any person who has acquired any of the\n\nassets from the borrower and from whom any money is due\n\nor may become due to the borrower, to pay the secured\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                               45</span>\n\n\ncreditor, so much of the money as is sufficient to pay the\n\nsecured debt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">19.     The opening words of sub- section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/57488768/\" id=\"a_146\">Section 14</a> of\n\nthe SARFAESI Act also provides that if any of the secured\n\nasset is required to be sold or transferred by the secured\n\fcreditor under the provisions of the Act, the secured creditor\n\nmay take the assistance of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate\n\nor the District Magistrate. Where, therefore, such a request\n\nis made by the secured creditor and the Chief Metropolitan\n\nMagistrate or the District Magistrate finds that the secured\n\nasset is in possession of a lessee but the lease under which\n\nthe lessee claims to be in possession of the secured asset\n\nstands determined in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/1134872/\" id=\"a_147\">Section 111</a> of the\n\nTransfer of Property Act, the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate\n\nor the District Magistrate may pass an order for delivery of\n\npossession of secured asset in favour of the secured creditor\n\nto enable the secured creditor to sell and transfer the same\n\nunder the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/52229129/\" id=\"a_148\">SARFAESI Act</a>. Sub- section (6)\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/152603276/\" id=\"a_149\">Section 13</a> of the SARFAESI Act provides that any transfer\n\nof secured asset after taking possession of secured asset by\n\nthe secured creditor shall vest in the transferee all rights in,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                                46</span>\n\n\nor in relation to, the secured asset transferred as if the\n\ntransfer had been made by the owner of such secured asset.\n\nIn other words, the transferee of a secured asset will not\n\nacquire any right in a secured asset under sub- section (6) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/152603276/\" id=\"a_150\">Section 13</a> of the SARFAESI Act, unless it has been effected\n\nafter the secured creditor has taken over possession of the\n\nsecured asset.   Thus, for the purpose of transferring the\n\nsecured asset and for realizing the secured debt, the secured\n\ncreditor will require the assistance of the Chief Metropolitan\n\nMagistrate or the District Magistrate for taking possession of\n\na secured asset from the lessee where the lease stands\n\ndetermined by any of the modes mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/1134872/\" id=\"a_151\">Section 111</a> of\n\nthe Transfer of Property Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">20.

It is also possible to take a view\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                              56</span>\n\n\nthat within 45 days from the date on which a possession\n\fnotice is delivered or affixed or published under sub- rules\n\n(1) and (2) of Rule 8 of the Security Interest (Enforcement)\n\nRules, 2002, a lessee may file an application before the\n\nDebts Recovery Tribunal having jurisdiction in the matter\n\nfor restoration of possession in case he is dispossessed of\n\nthe secured asset.     But when we read sub- section (3) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/112742697/\" id=\"a_185\">Section 17</a> of the SARFAESI Act, we find that the Debts\n\nRecovery Tribunal has powers to restore possession of the\n\nsecured asset to the borrower only and not to any person\n\nsuch as a lessee. Hence, even if the Debt Recovery Tribunal\n\ncomes to the conclusion that any of the measures referred to\n\nin sub- section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/152603276/\" id=\"a_186\">Section 13</a> taken by the secured\n\ncreditor are not in accordance with the provisions of the Act,\n\nit cannot restore possession of the secured asset to the\n\nlessee.    Where, therefore, the Debts Recovery Tribunal\n\nconsiders the application of the lessee and comes to the\n\nconclusion that the lease in favour of the lessee was made\n\nprior to the creation of mortgage or the lease though made\n\nafter the creation of mortgage is in accordance with the\n\nrequirements of <a href=\"/doc/1749243/\" id=\"a_187\">Section 65A</a> of the Transfer of Property Act\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                              57</span>\n\n\nand the lease was valid and binding on the mortgagee and\n\nthe lease is yet to be determined, the Debts Recovery\n\nTribunal will not have the power to restore possession of the\n\nsecured asset to the lessee.        In our considered opinion,\n\ntherefore, there is no remedy available under <a href=\"/doc/112742697/\" id=\"a_188\">Section 17</a> of\n\nthe SARFAESI Act to the lessee to protect his lawful\n\npossession under a valid lease.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1511187\" id=\"span_64\">25.

We find that in the\n\n      cases before us, the appellants have relied on the\n\n      written instruments or rent receipts issued by the\n\n      landlord to the tenant. <a href=\"/doc/515323/\" id=\"a_222\">Section 107</a> of the Transfer of\n\n      Property Act provides that a lease of immoveable\n\n      property from year to year, or for any term exceeding\n\n      one year or reserving a yearly rent, can be made ‘only\n\n      by a registered instrument’ and all other leases of\n\n      immoveable property          may be made either            by a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                       63</span>\n\n\n      registered       instrument           or      by    oral         agreement\n\n      accompanied by delivery of possession.
