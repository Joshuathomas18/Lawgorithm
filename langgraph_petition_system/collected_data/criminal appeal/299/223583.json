On 1st August, 2005, PW1 was sleeping in the verandah\n\nof his house alongwith his son Saran, whereas his wife was\n\nsleeping inside the house alongwith their daughter Shemi,\n\naged two years. As a matter of safety, PW-1 used to shut the\n\ndoor of the house from the outside. At about 4:00 a.m. on the\n\f                         Crl.Appeal Nos.1568-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                  1569/2008</span>\n2nd August, 2005,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                               2</span>\nPW-1 was told by his wife that Shemi was missing. The couple\n\nthereafter made a frantic search for the child in the vicinity\n\nand also called out loudly to her.     Hearing the noise, the\n\nneighbours assembled and joined the search party. An hour\n\nlater, the naked dead body of the child was found near the\n\nbridge across the AVM Canal and it was observed that two\n\ngold chains, one from the neck and the other from the waist,\n\nwere missing. The dead body was brought to the house and\n\nthe matter was reported to the police.      An FIR Exhibit P-1\n\nwas accordingly recorded at about 7 a.m. in the Police Station.\n\nThe police arrived in the village and made the necessary\n\ninquiries.   The dead body was also sent for a post-mortem\n\nexamination which was conducted by PW-9. The Post-mortem\n\nrevealed that :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     &quot;Death was due to combined effects of drawing\n     and blunt injuries sustained around nose and\n     mouth.

The accused who was seen loitering close by was arrested\n\nand sent for a medical examination.

The police also sent some of the articles\n\nwhich had been picked up from the place of incident including\n\nhuman hair, fibers of synthetic yarn and the frock which the\n\nchild had been wearing to the laboratory for examination.\n\nPursuant to a search of the appellant, two chains which were\n\f                        Crl.Appeal Nos.1568-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                 1569/2008</span>\nidentified as those\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                              4</span>\nworn by the child when she had been despoiled and murdered\n\nwere recovered, in the presence of PW-13. The police also sent\n\nthe swabs and smears taken from the child and her frock and\n\nfrom the clothes that the appellant had been wearing at the\n\ntime of the incident, and the laboratory reported the presence\n\nof semen and spermatozoa in the vaginal swab of AB blood\n\ngroup on his underwear and trousers and further opined that\n\nthe blood group of the appellant and the deceased child was\n\nAB (positive). The police also recorded the statements of PWs-\n\n5 and 6, the neighbours of the complainant who deposed that\n\nthey had seen the appellant roaming around in the vicinity of\n\nthe complainant&#x27;s house on the previous day.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">4.   The Trial Court relying on the aforesaid evidence awarded\n\nthe death sentence to the appellant. The Court observed that\n\nthe appellant had trespassed into the complainant&#x27;s house\n\nand taken the child away and had raped and then killed her.\n\nThe recovery of the waist chain and the necklace that the\n\ndeceased had been wearing when she had been taken away\n\nwhich had been handed over by the appellant to the police and\n\f                          Crl.Appeal Nos.1568-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                   1569/2008</span>\nthe recovery of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                5</span>\nfrock under a disclosure statement under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 27</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act and the statements of PW5 and PW6, and the\n\nappellant&#x27;s previous conviction in several such matters, were\n\ntaken as sufficient evidence against him.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">5.   Mr. Harinder Mohan Singh, the learned counsel for the\n\nappellant has, at the outset, pointed out that the evidence of\n\nPW-5, PW-6 and PW-7 with regard to the appellant being in\n\nthe vicinity of the house was uncertain and could not be relied\n\nupon and further that handing over of the jewellery witnessed\n\nby PW-13 and recovery of the frock from the appellant and\n\nduly witnessed by PW-12 had also not been proved.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">     The learned State counsel has, however, submitted that\n\none of the very significant circumstances against the appellant\n\nwas that he was a resident of a village about 40 Km. away\n\nfrom the place of incident and as his presence in the vicinity of\n\nthe murder site had been admitted even by the defence, he\n\nwas called upon to give some explanation as to what he was\n\ndoing so far away from home. It has, further, been highlighted\n\nthat PW-5, PW-6 and PW-7 who had seen him on the previous\n\f                         Crl.Appeal Nos.1568-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                  1569/2008</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">morning    moving\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                               6</span>\naround aimlessly had no animosity towards him and the fact\n\nthat the appellant appeared to be a paedophile and had been\n\ninvolved in two similar instances earlier and had been\n\nconvicted as well, was a matter of record and for this\n\nadditional reason no interference in this matter was called for.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">6.   We have considered the arguments advanced by the\n\nlearned counsel for the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">     The evidence of PW-5 and PW-6 reveals that appellant\n\nhad been seen around the complainant&#x27;s house on the\n\nprevious day and as he was not a resident of this area, he had\n\nbeen quickly singled out. These witnesses further stated the\n\nappellant had been seen in the vicinity again after the rape\n\nand murder and he had accordingly been apprehended and\n\nhanded over to the police and two chains worn by deceased\n\nhad been taken from his pockets. PW-13 also identified the\n\nchains in Court.    It is true that in the cross-examination of\n\nthese two witnesses, several improvements vis-`-vis their\n\nstatements under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_9\">section 161</a> of Cr.P.C. had been pointed out\n\nby the defence counsel, but the fact that the appellant had\n\f                          Crl.Appeal Nos.1568-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                   1569/2008</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">been    present   in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                 7</span>\nthe vicinity of the house and had been arrested, soon after the\n\nincident has been admitted even by the defence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">7.     Another significant piece of evidence is the statement of\n\nPW-7 who testified to the fact that about 2:30 a.m. on the\n\nnight of the murder he had gone out of the house to urinate\n\nand had seen the appellant outside and on being questioned,\n\nthe appellant had threatened him with dire consequences with\n\nthe result that he had not informed anybody till the third day\n\nafter the police had come to the village to verify the facts. He\n\ntoo stated to the fact that two chains had been recovered from\n\nthe pocket of the appellant.     It   is      true   that   several\n\nimprovements have been made by the three primary witnesses\n\nbut there is absolutely no reason as to why they would involve\n\nthe appellant in a false case as admittedly he was a stranger to\n\nthe locality and they bore him no ill will.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">8.     We have also gone through the evidence of PW-12\n\nrelating to the recovery of the frock pursuant to a disclosure\n\nstatement made by the appellant under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 27</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act.     Nothing could be spelt out from the cross-\n\f                         Crl.Appeal Nos.1568-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                  1569/2008</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">examination     of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                               8</span>\nthis witness except that the recovery had not been made from\n\na closed place, though he explained that there was very little\n\nmovement of human beings in that area as no one was\n\nresiding close by. This witness also identified the frock that\n\nhad been recovered. It is equally significant that the strands\n\nof fibre recovered from the place of incident had been matched\n\nwith the material of the frock and were found to be from the\n\nsame source.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">9.   It is true that in a criminal matter the onus of proof lies\n\nalmost exclusively on the prosecution.   As already mentioned\n\nabove, however, the appellant has not been able to give any\n\nexplanation in his statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_11\">section 313</a> of Cr.P.C. as\n\nto what he had been doing in that locality. On the contrary he\n\nadmitted his presence by stating that he had been caught by\n\nthe neighbours on suspicion of the murder and beaten up,\n\nand had suffered several injuries in the process. The medical\n\nevidence on the contrary reveals that these injuries could also\n\nhave been sustained while raping and killing the young child.\n\f                          Crl.Appeal Nos.1568-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                   1569/2008</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">10.   The evidence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                9</span>\nthat the appellant was a paedophile with extremely violent\n\npropensities also stands proved on record in that he had been\n\nconvicted and sentenced for an offence punishable under\n\nSection 354 in the year 1998 and later for offences punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/619940/\" id=\"a_12\">Sections 363</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_13\">376</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1101188/\" id=\"a_14\">379</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_15\">302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_16\">201</a> of the IPC for the\n\nrape and murder of a young child and had been awarded a\n\nsentence of imprisonment for life under Section 302, and\n\nseveral other terms of imprisonment with respect to the other\n\nsections, though, an appeal in this connection was pending as\n\non date. It is also extremely relevant that the appellant, had,\n\nin addition, been tried for the murders of several other\n\nchildren but had been acquitted on the 28th July, 2005 with\n\nthe benefit of doubt.   The present incident happened three\n\ndays later.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"989335\" id=\"span_17\">11.   The learned counsel for the appellant has finally urged\n\nthat the death sentence in the circumstances was not called\n\nfor. He has pointed out that the case rested on circumstantial\n\nevidence and the death penalty should not ordinarily be\n\nawarded in such a case.    It has further been emphasised that\n\f                         Crl.Appeal Nos.1568-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                  1569/2008</span>\nthe appellant was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                               10</span>\na young man 24 years of age at the time of the incident.     We\n\nare of the opinion that in the background of these facts, that\n\nthe death penalty ought to be converted to imprisonment for\n\nlife but in terms laid down by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/989335/\" id=\"a_17\">Swamy\n\nShraddananda vs. State of Karnataka</a> (2008) 13 SCC 767 as\n\nhis continuance as a member of an ordered society is uncalled\n\nfor . We quote here-in-below the relevant observations :</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      &quot;92. The matter may be looked at from a slightly\n      different angle. The issue of sentencing has two\n      aspects. A sentence may be excessive and unduly\n      harsh or it may be highly disproportionately\n      inadequate. When an appellant comes to this Court\n      carrying a death sentence awarded by the trial court\n      and confirmed by the High Court, this court may find,\n      as in the present appeal, that the case just falls short\n      of the rarest of the rare category and may feel\n      somewhat reluctant in endorsing the death sentence.\n      But at the same time, having regard to the nature of\n      the crime, the Court may strongly feel that a sentence\n      of life imprisonment subject to remission normally\n      works out to a term of 14 years would be grossly\n      disproportionate and inadequate. What then should\n      the Court do? If the Court&#x27;s option is limited only to\n      two punishments, one a sentence of imprisonment, for\n      all intents and purposes, of not more than 14 year and\n      the other death, the Court may feel tempted and find\n      itself nudged into endorsing the death penalty. Such\n      a course would indeed be disastrous. A far more just,\n      reasonable and proper course would be to expand the\n      options and to take over what, as a matter of fact,\n      lawfully belongs to the Court i.e. the vast hiatus\n      between 14 years&#x27; imprisonment and death. It needs\n\f                          Crl.Appeal Nos.1568-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                   1569/2008</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                                                         to         be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                11</span>\n       emphasised that the Court would take recourse to the\n       expanded option primarily because in the facts of the\n       case, the sentence of 14 years&#x27; imprisonment would\n       amount to no punishment at all.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">       94. In the light of the discussions made above we are\n       clearly of the view that there is a good and strong\n       basis for the Court to substitute a death sentence by\n       life imprisonment or by a term in excess of fourteen\n       years and further to direct that the convict must not be\n       released from the prison for the rest of his life or for\n       the actual term as specified in the order, as the case\n       may be.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">       95. In conclusion, we agree with the view taken by\n       Sinha, J.      We accordingly substitute the death\n       sentence given to the appellant by the trial court and\n       confirmed by the High Court by imprisonment for life\n       and direct that he shall not be released from prison till\n       the rest of his life.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"989335\" id=\"span_22\">12.
