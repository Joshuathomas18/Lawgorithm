Naktoo assaulted on the head of Gajendra by\nsaria, Kishan assaulted on the head of Gajendra by sword\nand Mahesh also caused injury on the right hand&#x27;s elbow\nof Ganjendra by means of sword. Accused Vidyapuri\ncaused injuries to Ganjendra by gandasi in his right\nforearm. When Ram Singh and Om Prakash tried to rescue\nthen accused Bharat, Kishan and Vidya caused injury to\nthem by sword and gandasi. As a result of the injuries\ncaused to Ganjendra, he died on the spot. On making\nalarm, Mantha, Jagdish, Chandrabhan and Sarvan rushed\ntowards the place of occurrence and on seeing them, the\naccused persons fled from the spot. Thereafter, they took\nthe injured persons Ram Singh, Omprakash &amp; the dead\nbody of deceased Gajendra in the tractor trolley to Police\nStation Pohari for lodging the FIR, but the in-charge of\nPolice Station did not lodge the report, then they rushed to\nPolice     Station     Kotwali   Shivpuri      and       submitted    an\napplication (Exhibit P-1), on that basis, a case was lodged\nwarranting investigation for the offences punishable under\n<a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_11\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_12\">323</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 149</a> of IPC.\nThe      injured     and   deceased     were      sent    for   medical\nexamination. Later on, as the incident was within the\njurisdiction of Police Station Pohari, hence the FIR was\nsent to above Police Station, where the original case was\nregistered as FIR (Exhibit P-35). Upon conclusion of the\ninvestigation, the charge-sheet was filed to the Court of\nJudicial Magistrate First Class, Pohari, district Shivpuri,\nwho committed the case to the Court of Sessions and\nultimately it was transferred to IIIrd Additional Session\nJudge, Shivpuri.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">(5)          After    hearing    counsel    for    the    parties,   the\nSessions Court framed the charges for the offences\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                             4</span>\n                                    Criminal Appeal Nos. 540/2000 &amp; 389/2001\n\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_15\">Sections 148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_16\">302</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 149</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_18\">323</a> or 323/149 and <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 25</a>/<a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_20\">27</a> of the Arms Act against\naccused Rameshpuri; under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_21\">Sections 148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_22\">302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_23\">323</a> and\n<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_24\">323</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_25\">149</a> of IPC against the accused Kalyan, Vidyapuri,\nMaheshpuri, Naktoo &amp; Kishanpuri, whereas charges under\nSections 148, 302/149, 323 or 323/149 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_26\">IPC</a> were framed\nagainst the accused Prahlad, Kamalpuri, Bharatpuri &amp;\nPintoo     @    Dinesh.    On   denial       of   charges,     the    trial\ncommenced as desired.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">(6)          To prove the charges as framed against the\naccused persons, the prosecution examined 19 witnesses.\nAfter completion of prosecution evidence, the accused\npersons were examined under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C.\n(7)          The accused persons took a plea that they are\ninnocent and have been falsely implicated in the matter. In\nthe defence, they examined 4 witnesses, namely, Bharosi\n(DW/1), Ramdayal Verma (DW/2), Shankarlal Shrivastava\n(DW/3) and Gopalkrishna Trivedi (DW/4).\n(8)          The trial Court after considering the evidence\nadduced by the parties concluded that the prosecution has\nfailed to make out a case against Naktoo, Kamal @\nKamalpuri, Rameshpuri, Pintoo @ Dinesh and Prahlad, and\ntherefore, they were acquitted, however, observed that\nthere is       overwhelming evidence against the appellants\nKishanpuri, Mahesh, Bharatpuri, Vidyapuri &amp; Kalyan,\ntherefore,      conviction was recorded against them for the\noffences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_28\">Sections 148</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_29\">302</a> of IPC.\nHence, the present appeals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">(9)          Learned      counsel     for   the    accused/appellants\nwhile arguing for setting aside the order of conviction and\nsentence, as impugned herein, contended that conviction\nof the appellants/accused is based on surmises and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                       5</span>\n                            Criminal Appeal Nos. 540/2000 &amp; 389/2001\n\n\nconjectures. It is contended that the prosecution has\nutterly failed in proving the guilt against appellants\nbeyond reasonable doubt. Thus, there is               no cogent\nevidence to fasten the guilt over the appellants. The First\nInformation Report was lodged after a delay of 7 hours of\nthe incident and there is no explanation for such delay in\nlodging the FIR. It is urged that there are material\ncontradictions and improvements in the testimony of\nprosecution witnesses. No independent witness supported\nthe prosecution case. In the statement of Bharat Singh\n(PW-1), he stated that there was enmity between the\nparties and on the report of accused Narayanpuri, a case\nwas also registered against the complainant under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_30\">Section\n307</a> of IPC and the same is pending         in the Court, thus,\nthere is every possibility of implicating the present\nappellants in a false and fabricated case. On these\ncontentions, learned counsel for the appellants seek\nquashment of order of conviction and seek acquittal.\n(10)      Learned counsel for the State supported the\njudgment of conviction and sentence passed by the trial\nCourt against the appellants/accused and submitted that\nthe same does not call for any interference. He further\nsubmitted that the trial Court has committed error by\nacquitting   the    respondents/accused.          There      exist\noverwhelming evidence against the respondents/accused.\nTherefore, finding of acquittal recorded in favour of\nrespondents/accused deserves to be set-aside. The trial\nCourt has concluded in paragraph 54 of the impugned\njudgment that after considering the evidence of the\nprosecution, it is clear that Gajendra Singh died due to the\ninjuries caused by the accused persons, but in spite of that\nrespondents/accused persons have been acquitted by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                           6</span>\n                                Criminal Appeal Nos. 540/2000 &amp; 389/2001\n\n\ntrial Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">(11)         We have heard learned counsel for the parties\nand perused the record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">(12)         At the outset, as regard to the death of\nGajendra whether was homicidal, the evidence given by Dr.\nNisar Ahemad (PW-6) may be considered, who performed\nthe postmortem on the body of deceased and gave his\nreport (Exhibit P-6).

The FIR (Exhibit P-2)\nwas lodged by Bharat Singh (PW-1) after 7 hours of the\nincident, whereas the Police Station Kotwali, Shivpuri was\n45 kms away from the village Bagwasakala where the\nincident took place. Bharat Singh (PW-1), Ram Singh (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_26\">4) and Omprakash (PW-5) stated in their examination-in-\nchief that firstly they reached the Police Station-Pohari for\nlodging the FIR, but after waiting for half an hour when\nthe Police did not lodge the report, they rushed to Police\nStation Kotwali Shivpuri as the condition of the injured\npersons was worsening. They submitted a written report\nand on that basis the FIR (Exhibit P-2) was recorded.\nVeerendra Singh Tomar (PW-17), the then SHO, Police\nStation Pohari, stated in his cross-examination that the\ninjured persons firstly reached to the Pohari hospital and\nafter receiving the information, Head Constable went there\nto record the report, but complainant refused to lodge any\nreport in the hospital by stating that they will lodge the\nreport at Shivpuri. Although, this fact is mentioned in the\nstatements of     witnesses-Bharat Singh, Ram Singh &amp;\nOmprakash Singh recorded under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 161</a> of Cr.P.C,\nbut in the cross-examination, they denied the above fact\nand submitted that they have not given such statement to\nthe Police. The prosecution has not filed any intimation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                         9</span>\n                                Criminal Appeal Nos. 540/2000 &amp; 389/2001\n\n\nreceived by Police Station Pohari from Civil Hospital Pohari\nthat injured were brought to the hospital and after\nreceiving information, Police went to the Pohari hospital. If\nsuch intimation was received by the Police Station Pohari,\nthen   it would have recorded in the rojnamcha. The\nprosecution has not produced any copy of rojnamcha to\nsubstantiate   this   fact.   In   these       circumstances,      this\npossibility cannot be ruled out that to justify the act of non-\nregistration of FIR by the Police, it has           been suo moto\nwritten by the Police in the statements of witnesses. There\nis nothing on record which shows that the Head Constable\nRaja Babu went to the Civil Hospital for recording the FIR,\ntherefore, non-examination of Raja Babu cannot be a\nground for rejection of entire prosecution&#x27;s case.\n(16)      Looking to the distance of the Police Station\nfrom the place of occurrence and the circumstances\nexplained by the complainant-Bharat Singh, it cannot be\nsaid that the FIR was belated or it is a concocted\ndocument.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">(17)      Learned     counsel      for   the    appellants/accused\nsubmitted that the prosecution has not complied with the\nprovision of <a href=\"/doc/1943580/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 157 (1)</a> of Cr.P.C, and the copy of FIR\nwas not sent to the Judicial Magistrate, however, from\nperusal of the record, it appears that the copy of the report\nwas sent to the concerned Magistrate on 03.09.1998,\nwhich was received on the same day, therefore, we do not\nfind any force in the argument advanced by learned\ncounsel for the appellants/accused in this regard.\n(18)      Bharat Singh (PW-1) stated that accused Kishan\ngave a blow of sword on head of Gajendra. Chandrabhan\n(PW/2) deposed that accused Kishan, Bharat &amp; Mahesh\nwere having sword and they inflicted injuries on the head\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                        10</span>\n                             Criminal Appeal Nos. 540/2000 &amp; 389/2001\n\n\nand hand of Gajendra Singh. At the time of incident,\nKalyan and Vidya were armed with gandasi, whereas the\nKamlu was having saria and they caused injuries to the\nGajendra. Mantha (PW/3) stated that after hearing some\nhue and cry, he rushed to the spot where he saw that\naccused persons were beating deceased Gajendra, but he\ncould not saw that who caused injury on which part of the\nbody of deceased Gajendra.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">(19)      Ram Singh (PW-4) and Omprakash (PW-5) stated\nthat on 01.09.1998 at about 5:05 pm, they along with\nGajendra were playing chaupad on the platform of Bharosi\nDhakad, at that time the accused persons came there and\nsurrounded them. The accused Kishan, Bharat and Mahesh\nwere armed with sword, whereas accused Vidya was\nhaving gandasi, accused Kamlu was armed with Sariya and\nwith intend to commit murder of Gajendra, they caused\ninjuries to him, as a result of which he died on the spot.\n(20)      The said eye witnesses are no doubt close\nrelatives of the deceased but that by itself cannot be a\nground to discard their testimony. It, however, certainly\nputs this Court on its guard to scrutinize their evidence\nmore carefully, keeping in view their unnatural conduct.\nThe presence of complainant and witnesses along with the\ndeceased has been found proved. Their statements were\ncogent and consistent and were also corroborated by the\nmedical evidence. The names of appellants/accused were\nalso clearly disclosed in the FIR, Ex. P-2. It is the settled\nlaw that conviction can even be based on the sole\ntestimony of an eyewitness provided that testimony is\nfound to be wholly reliable. The appreciation of evidence\nby the court below is proper and we have not been\npersuaded to take a different view. Merely because, 5\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                           11</span>\n                                Criminal Appeal Nos. 540/2000 &amp; 389/2001\n\n\nother persons named by him as accused were acquitted,\nwould not render their testimony as wholly suspicious\nbecause falsus in uno falsus in omnibus is not rule of law\naccepted by the courts in this country. The Trial court has\nopined that since the testimony of Prosecution Witnesses\nBharat Singh (PW-1), Chandrabhan (PW-2), Mantha (PW-3),\nRam Singh (PW-4) &amp; Omprakash (PW-5) had not been\nsupported by the medical evidence insofar as the injuries\nattributed to the respondents Naktoo @ Narayanpuri,\nKamal @ Kamalpuri, Rameshpuri, Pintu @ Dineshprui &amp;\nPrahlad are concerned, therefore, the benefit of doubt was\nrequired to be given to them and they were acquitted.</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n(21)      The sheet anchor of the argument on behalf of\nthe       appellants/accused              had          been        the\ncontradictions/improvements          in     the      statements      of\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">witnesses, however they are not material and do not go to\nthe root of the cause. Although the eye witnesses have\nadmitted in their cross-examination that they cannot say as\nto which appellant gave which blow on which part of the\nbody of the deceased, but they have explained the reason\nthat deceased was surrounded by the assailants. Nothing\nhad come in their cross-examination to controvert their\nstatements in respect to the injuries caused to the\ndeceased by the appellant/accused persons, therefore, the\nstatement of the prosecution witnesses have remained\nintact to that extent.

The trial court, after\n            going through the entire evidence, must\n            form an opinion about the credibility of the\n            witnesses and the appellate Court in normal\n            course would not be justified in reviewing\n            the same again without justifiable reasons.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_30\">(22)      Learned counsel for the appellants/accused also\nsubmitted that the deceased had received injuries in a\ntractor trolley accident, but this argument has no force\nbecause the deceased has received total 23 injuries which\nwere caused by sharp cutting objects, therefore, it is not\npossible that these injuries can be received in an accident.\n(23)      The appellants had not taken a plea of alibi in\ntheir examination recorded under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 313</a> of Cr.P.C,\ntherefore, the statements of defence witnesses has no\nvalue.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">(24)      Having considered the entire evidence available\non record, we do not find any merit in the arguments\nadvanced by learned counsel for the appellants/accused\nthat the charges leveled against the appellants have not\nbeen proved beyond reasonable doubt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">(25)      On the basis of the aforesaid discussion, there is\nno substance in the Criminal Appeal No. 540/2000 filed by\nthe appellants/accused.

In this regard the trial Court has\nappreciated the evidence in Paras 62 &amp; 63 of the\nimpugned judgment and discussed each and every aspect\nof the involvement of respondents elaborately, therefore, it\nis not possible to hold that the respondents/accused were\npresent during the offence and they shared common object\nto murder the deceased, therefore, the trial Court has\nrightly acquitted the respondents.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">(27)       We have been taken through the entire record by\nthe Public Prosecutor, we do not find any ground on the\nbasis of which we may reach the conclusion that any of the\nfinding recorded by the court below is improbable or does\nnot    require   affirmation   regarding       acquittal     of   the\nrespondents/accused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"366111\" id=\"span_14\">(28)       It is the settled law that the High Court would\nnot ordinarily interfere with the order of acquittal unless\nthe approach of the lower appellate Court is vitiated by\nsome manifest illegality.
