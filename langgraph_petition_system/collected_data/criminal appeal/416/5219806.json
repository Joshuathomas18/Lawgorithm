Chauhan, J:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      1.    This appeal has been preferred against the impugned judgment and\n      order dated 30.5.2007, passed by Special Judge of the Designated Court\n      under the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_1\">Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention)  Act,  1987</a>\n      (hereinafter referred to as the ‘TADA’) for the Bombay Blast,  Greater\n      Bombay, in the Bombay Blast Case No. 1/1993, convicting the  appellant\n      under <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 5</a> TADA, and awarding  the  punishment  of  5  years  RI,\n      alongwith a fine of Rs.25,000/-, and in default of payment of fine, to\n      further undergo RI for 6 months.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      2.    Facts and circumstances giving rise to this appeal are that:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">      A.    As the facts of this case and all legal issues  involved  herein\n      have been elaborately dealt with in the connected appeal i.e. Criminal\n      Appeal No. 1728  of  2007   [Yakub  Abdul  Razak  Memon  v.  State  of\n      Maharashtra thr. CBI],  it  may  be  pertinent  to  mention  only  the\n      relevant facts and charges against the  appellant (A-20).\n      B.    Bombay Blast took place on 12.3.1993 in which 257  persons  lost\n      their lives and 713 were injured.  In addition thereto there had  been\n      loss of property worth several crores.  The Bombay police investigated\n      the matter at initial stage but subsequently it was entrusted  to  the\n      Central Bureau of Investigation (hereinafter referred to as ‘CBI’) and\n      on conclusion of the investigation, a chargesheet was filed against  a\n      large number of accused persons.  Out of the accused  persons  against\n      whom chargesheet was filed, 40 accused  could not be put to  trial  as\n      they have been absconding.  Thus,  the  Designated  Court  under  TADA\n      framed charges against 138 accused  persons.   During  the  trial,  11\n      accused died and 2 accused turned  hostile.   Further  the  Designated\n      Court discharged 2 accused during  trial  and  the  remaining  persons\n      including appellant (A-20) stood convicted.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      C.    The appellant had been charged for general conspiracy  which  is\n      framed against all the accused persons  for  the  offences  punishable\n      under <a href=\"/doc/105771932/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 3(3)</a> TADA and <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 120-B</a> of Indian Penal  Code,  1860\n      (hereinafter referred to as ‘<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_5\">IPC</a>’)  read  with  <a href=\"/doc/186975316/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections  3(2)(i)(ii)</a>,\n      <a href=\"/doc/105771932/\" id=\"a_7\">3(3)</a>,  (4),   5   and   6   TADA   and   read   with   <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections   302</a>,\n      <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_9\">307</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_10\">326</a>,<a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_11\">324</a>,<a href=\"/doc/222396/\" id=\"a_12\">427</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1552733/\" id=\"a_13\">435</a>,<a href=\"/doc/1517318/\" id=\"a_14\">436</a>, <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_15\">201</a> and <a href=\"/doc/66955/\" id=\"a_16\">212</a> IPC and offences under <a href=\"/doc/17720539/\" id=\"a_17\">Sections 3</a>\n      and <a href=\"/doc/85348422/\" id=\"a_18\">7</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/115215639/\" id=\"a_19\">Sections 25</a> (I-A), (l-B)(a)  of  the  <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_20\">Arms  Act,  1959</a>\n      (hereinafter referred to as the ‘<a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_21\">Arms Act</a>’), <a href=\"/doc/176528/\" id=\"a_22\">Sections  9-B(1)(a)(b)(c)</a>\n      of the Explosives Act, 1884. <a href=\"/doc/1056565/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections 3</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1319225/\" id=\"a_24\">4(a)(b)</a>,  <a href=\"/doc/1335368/\" id=\"a_25\">5</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1539301/\" id=\"a_26\">6</a>  of  the\n      Explosive Substances Act, 1908 and <a href=\"/doc/114174486/\" id=\"a_27\">Section  4</a>  of  the  Prevention  of\n      Damage to Public Property Act, 1984.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      D.    In addition to the general charge of  conspiracy,  he  had  also\n      been charged under <a href=\"/doc/1056565/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 3(3)</a> TADA, under <a href=\"/doc/1335368/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 5</a> TADA for keeping\n      one AK-56 rifle plus two empty magazines and committed an  offence  in\n      respect of the same under <a href=\"/doc/1539301/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 6</a> TADA, and under <a href=\"/doc/1056565/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 3(4)</a>  TADA\n      read with <a href=\"/doc/66955/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 212</a> IPC, for harbouring criminals.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      3.    After conclusion of the trial, the  appellant  (A-20)  had  been\n      convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1335368/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 5</a> TADA, and awarded the sentence as  mentioned\n      hereinabove.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">            Hence, this appeal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">      4.    Shri Sunil Kumar,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the\n      appellant (A-20), has submitted that conviction of the  appellant  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">      20) under <a href=\"/doc/1335368/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 5</a> TADA, was not warranted in view of the  fact  that\n      the  recovery  had  not  been  proved  in  accordance  with  law.  The\n      disclosure statement alleged to have been made under the provision  of\n      <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 27</a> of  the  Indian  Evidence  Act,  1872  (hereinafter  called\n      ‘<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_36\">Evidence Act</a>’) has not  been  strictly  followed.  The  said  alleged\n      disclosure statement did not bear the signature of the  appellant  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">      20). There were two panch witnesses, only one has been examined.   The\n      panch witness examined in the case had been a  stock  witness  in  the\n      police as he had appeared as a panch witness in other cases.   He  was\n      the resident of an area in close vicinity of the office of  the  Crime\n      Branch of the  police  department.   The  watchman  of  the  Ghanshyam\n      building from which the recovery had been made, has not been examined.\n      None of  the  neighbours  of  that  building  have  been  examined  as\n      witnesses.  There  are  material   contradictions/omissions   in   the\n      deposition of the witnesses. Even the case  number  has  wrongly  been\n      mentioned.  The L.A.C. No.22/93 had been manipulated and it was  shown\n      as L.A.C.No.23/93.  Even the recovery of the AK-56 rifle does not give\n      rise to the presumption of possession. It was further  submitted  that\n      the confession of the appellant (A-20) had been obtained  by  coercion\n      by severely  beating  him.   Therefore,  the  appeal  deserves  to  be\n      allowed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">      5.    On the  contrary,  Shri  Mukul  Gupta,  learned  senior  counsel\n      appearing for  the  respondent,  has  vehemently  opposed  the  appeal\n      contending that the confession of the appellant (A-20)  has  not  been\n      relied  upon  by  the  Designated   Court,   therefore,   it   remains\n      inconsequential. Only one of the panch witnesses had been examined  in\n      order to avoid multiplicity. Mere non-examination of the  other  panch\n      witnesses would not make the case of the  prosecution  doubtful.   The\n      recovery had been made strictly in accordance with law and in case the\n      recovery had been made at the instance of the disclosure statement and\n      from the place on which the appellant (A-20)  had  control  over,  the\n      presumption has rightly been drawn,  particularly  in view of the fact\n      that the appellant  (A-20)  did not  lead  any  evidence  in  defence.\n      Thus, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">      6.    We have considered the rival submissions made by learned counsel\n      for the parties and perused the record.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">      7.    Evidence against the appellant (A-20):\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">      (a)   Confessional statement of the appellant (A-20)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      (b)   Confessional statement of Murad Ibrahim Khan (A-130)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      (c)   Deposition of Mohamed Ayub Mohamed Umar (PW-72)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      (d)   Deposition of Sahadev (PW-181)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      (e)   Deposition of Nagesh Shivdas Lohar (PW-356)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      (f)   Deposition of Shivaji Shankar Sawant (PW-524)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      (g)   Recovery of AK-56 rifle and two magazines\n\n\n      Confessional statement of the appellant (A-20):\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">      8.    The confessional statement made by the appellant  has  not  been\n      relied upon by learned Special Judge. Therefore, we are not making any\n      reference to it and it has to be ignored.  More so, we do not find any\n      force in the submission made by Shri Sunil Kumar that there  had  been\n      two FIR’s in respect of the same incident as a large number of  remand\n      applications had been filed and it is  evident  from  the  application\n      that at initial stage it was shown as L.A.C.  23/93, but a  correction\n      had been made though without initials  by  the  person  who  made  the\n      correction, but in his subsequent application it  had  been  shown  as\n      L.A.C. 22/93. More so, the FIR number  connecting  this  case  is  the\n      same. Only one FIR had been exhibited in the court as  Exhibit  1284-A\n      dated 18.4.1993 and it contains case no. L.A.C. 23/93.  Therefore,  we\n      do not think that the submission requires further consideration.\n      Confessional statement of Murad Ibrahim Khan (A-130):\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">      9.    He had disclosed that he was fully acquainted  with  Yakub  Yeda\n      and the appellant (A-20).   Thus,  he  was  having  acquaintance  with\n      hardened criminals.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">      Deposition of Mohamed Ayub Mohamed Umar (PW-72)\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">      10.    He is a panch witness and  a  hawker,  selling  fruits  on  the\n      footpath near Crawford Market.  He deposed that on 17.4.1993 at  about\n      12.45 hours, he was called to the police station  by  a  Hawaldar  and\n      there Constable, Shivaji Sawant, P.I. asked him whether he would  like\n      to act as a panch witness in a case related to the  Bombay  Blast.  He\n      consented for the same and one more panch witness was also present  in\n      the said room.  In his presence, accused (A-20) disclosed his name  as\n      Salim Khan and he said in Hindi that he was in possession of one AK-56\n      rifle and two magazines in his workshop the recovery of which he would\n      get effected. The witness further corroborated the entire  version  of\n      the recovery\n            The witness further deposed that the police party alongwith  the\n      accused (A-20) and the panch witnesses proceeded in the police vehicle\n      and towards the place disclosed by the appellant  (A-20)  and  entered\n      the building pointed out by the appellant (A-20).  The  said  workshop\n      had a loft and one staircase. One police officer  went  on  the  loft.\n      Thereafter, all other persons followed him. On the directions of   the\n      appellant,  cartons, scrap material and gunny bag   were  found.   The\n      said gunny bag was turned out for emptying the same.  One AK-56  rifle\n      and two magazines were taken out of the said  gunny  bag.   The  AK-56\n      rifle and magazines were separately wrapped in brown paper  and  three\n      packets were prepared and sealed separately. The packets  were  signed\n      by him, co-panchas and Shri Sawant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">            In cross-examination, the witness (PW.72) said that label put up\n      on the recovered goods had  his  signature  and  the  goods  had  been\n      seized.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">            He further denied the suggestion made by the defence that he was\n      the regular panch witness for the police.

During  the  said  interrogation,  the  appellant  (A-20)\n      consented to make the voluntary statement and in the presence  of  the\n      panch witnesses and other police officials, the appellant (A-20)  made\n      a  disclosure  statement  in  Hindi.  He  recorded  the  same  in  the\n      panchanama.  The panchnama was read over to the appellant  (A-20)  and\n      the panch  witnesses.  It  was  signed  by  the  panch  witnesses  and\n      countersigned by him (A-20).

He  corroborated  that  Shri  Sawant  had  asked  the\n      appellant (A-20) whether he wanted to make  the  voluntary  statement.\n      Thereafter, appellant made the statement in Hindi.   He  recorded  the\n      statement of the appellant in Hindi in the panchnama which was  marked\n      as Exh. 378 and is the same  panchanama  recorded  by  him  about  the\n      statement of appellant (A-20) between 17th and 18th April, 1993.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">      14.   The recovery of the AK-56 rifle and two magazines had been  made\n      on 17th/18th April, 1993 and in respect of the  same  panchanama  Exh.\n      383 makes it clear that Farid Alam Rais Alam Qureshi and Mohamad  Ayub\n      Mohamad Umar had been the panch witnesses and in  their  presence  the\n      appellant (A-20) voluntarily made a disclosure statement that the  AK-\n      56 rifle was kept in his workshop. This  panchnama  was  concluded  at\n      23.10 hours on 17.4.1993.  The panchnama has been signed by  both  the\n      witnesses as well as by the Inspector of  Police,  Shri  S.S.  Sawant.\n      However, it does not bear the signature of the appellant  (A-20).   It\n      further shows that  in  continuation  of  the  same,  the  search  was\n      conducted and it reveals that after making the  disclosure  statement,\n      the police had taken the accused alongwith the panch  witnesses  to  a\n      closed workshop named as ‘Bona Parte’ industry belonging to  him.  The\n      said workshop was having its shutter down and locked and in absence of\n      the key the police forced open the lock  and  opened  the  same.   The\n      panchas alongwith the accused (A-20) and the police party entered  the\n      workshop and found that there was no electricity however,  they  found\n      that the loft measured approximately 16’ x  40’  had  a  loft  with  a\n      staircase. The appellant (A-20)  led  all  of  them  to  the  loft  by\n      staircase. On reaching there the appellant (A-20) took out a  box  and\n      scrap was removed.  One AK-56 rifle and  empty  magazines  were  found\n      wrapped in gunny sack. The  police  examined  the  said  material  and\n      prepared the recovery memo.  The recovery  memo  contained  one  AK-56\n      assault rifle of folding type butt, in rusted condition but  had  been\n      greased  and  two  magazines  of   AK-56   assault   rifle   with   no\n      identification marks and numbers and it was in  rusted  condition  and\n      greased.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">      15.    The Designated Court after appreciating the evidence on  record\n      came to the conclusion as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">           “A-20 having not explained the reason of his knowledge of such a\n           contraband articles being kept in a said factory of which he was\n           partner the same will lead only  to  the  inference  of  himself\n           having kept the same. The same is obvious  as  A-20  could  have\n           knowledge about the same in three contingencies i.e. a)  he  had\n           kept the contrabands himself b) having seen somebody keeping the\n           same there c) somebody had told him that the same being kept  at\n           the said place or having seen himself of   such  articles  being\n           kept at that place. In view of  failure  of  A-20  to  give  any\n           explanation regarding his knowledge being due to the reasons  as\n           stated in the aforesaid clauses b) and c) the same will lead  to\n           the conclusion as stated aforesaid. With regard to matter stated\n           in clause c) aforesaid it can be additionally added  that  since\n           the accused was also partner  of  the  said  shop  allowing  the\n           remaining of such articles at the said place would also  attract\n           the liability for the same….]\n\n\n           The same is the case regarding the submission  advanced  on  the\n           basis of A-20 at the time of recovery not having the key of  the\n           relevant gala.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">           In light of the aforesaid discussion it is difficult  to  accept\n           the submission canvassed that the evidence  only  establish  the\n           knowledge of A-20 of the contraband material lying at  the  said\n           place and the same does not amount to himself being in conscious\n           possession of the same. Needless  to  add  that  the  inferences\n           flowing from the statement made by A-20 consciously are not of a\n           nature of denoting himself not being in conscious possession  of\n           contraband articles within the notified area….”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">      16.   We have appreciated the evidence on record and the case  depends\n      upon the veracity of evidence regarding recovery.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">            There is sufficient material to show that the recovery had  been\n      made at the behest of the appellant (A-20) from the factory owned by a\n      partnership to which he was the partner alongwith  one  Surjit  Singh.\n      In such a fact-situation, he ought to have explained the reason/source\n      of his knowledge  of  such  contraband  articles  being  kept  in  his\n      factory.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">      17.   In the instant case, as he has not mentioned that  he  had  seen\n      someone keeping the articles there, or somebody  had  told  him  about\n      that, or he had seen the  things  lying  there,  the  only  reasonable\n      inference is drawn that he himself had kept the same  at  that  place.\n      Being a partner of the firm if he was having the knowledge  that  some\n      contraband were lying in his premises, he ought to have  informed  the\n      police if he had no guilty mind.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">      18.   So far as the explanation that at the time of  recovery  he  did\n      not have the key, would not be enough  to  tilt  the  balance  in  his\n      favour.  The fact that  he  did  not  have  the  key  becomes  totally\n      redundant, as no conclusion can be drawn that the appellant (A-20) was\n      not in possession of the said premises, and in such a  fact-situation,\n      it cannot be held that the  appellant  (A-20)  was  not  in  conscious\n      possession of the contraband material.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">      19.   We do not find any force in the submissions made by  Shri  Sunil\n      Kumar, learned senior counsel appearing for the appellant (A-20), that\n      the panch witness was the resident  of  Sitaram  building,  which  was\n      opposite to the office of the Commissioner of Police,  or  in  a  very\n      close proximity of the same, and was working on  the  footpath  nearby\n      the said building, and he had acted earlier as a panch witness in test\n      identification parade.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">      20.   The police when searching for a panch witness, need  not  go  to\n      far off place of the police station as the panchnama  is  required  to\n      be  recorded  in  a  close  proximity  of  time,  when   the   accused\n      apprehending his disclosure statement.  Therefore,  on  such  material\n      suspicion about the credential of the police or panch witnesses cannot\n      be doubted, unless there is some material to prove the  contrary.  Had\n      it been picked up from a far off  place,  criticism  could  have  been\n      otherwise as to why  the  panch  witness  could  not  be  called  from\n      neighbourhood.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">      21.   The panch witness Mohamed Ayub Mohamed Umar (PW-72) could not be\n      held to  be  a  tutored  witness  or  acting  at  the  behest  of  the\n      prosecution only on the ground that he had also been  the  witness  in\n      another case. It does not give a reason to draw inference that he  was\n      a stock panch witness unless it is shown that he  had  acted  in  such\n      capacity in a very large number of cases.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_33\">      22.   More so, it cannot be held that Mohamed Ayub Mohamed  Umar  (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">      72) was not an independent witness, or acting under  the  pressure  of\n      the police as he was  carrying  the  business  illegally  without  any\n      license.  More so,  the  appellant  (A-20)  had  made  the  disclosure\n      statement in his presence, he could explain the  same.  Therefore,  it\n      could not be held that he was deposing falsely.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">      23.   We do not see any reason as to why his evidence  should  not  be\n      relied upon.  Minor omissions/contradictions  regarding  labeling  and\n      sealing  are not really the contradictions which go to the root of the\n      matter.  Non-examination  of  the  watchman  of  Ghanshyam  Industrial\n      Estate,   or  omission  of  factor  regarding  electricity  being  not\n      mentioned in the panchnama, or non-collection of broken lock, are  the\n      omissions of trivial nature, and do not warrant any  undue  importance\n      for doubting the evidence of recovery.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_36\">      24.   Law does not require the witness to corroborate the evidence  of\n      an independent witness.  Thus, the evidence of  Mohamed  Ayub  Mohamed\n      Umar (PW-72) duly corroborated by the  contemporaneous  panchnama   is\n      trustworthy.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_37\">      25.   As  the  appellant  (A-20)  made  a  statement  leading  to  the\n      discovery of AK-56 assault rifle  and two magazines   having  kept  in\n      his workshop and the same had been found concealed on  the  loft,   he\n      cannot escape from the liability of  possessing and concealing of  the\n      same, thus liable to be punished under <a href=\"/doc/1335368/\" id=\"a_37\">Section  5</a>  TADA.

His (A-21) confessional statement had  been  recorded,  however,\n      the same had been discarded by the Designated Court, thus it cannot be\n      considered.  The evidence against the  appellant  (A-21)  remains  the\n      recovery of the aforesaid arms and ammunition.  In fact,  an  FIR  had\n      been registered on 5.4.1993 at 6.10 p.m. that the appellant (A-21) was\n      found in possession of a Carbine of 30 Caliber  of  U.S.  make,  three\n      magazines and 28 cartridges without holding a fire arms  license.   It\n      was further revealed that on that day, the police got information that\n      the appellant (A-21)  who was  a  resident  of  Pydhonie,  Mumbai  was\n      scheduled to come near a mosque opposite Pydhonie  Police  Station  to\n      acquire arms and ammunition of foreign make.  On that information  the\n      trap was arranged near the Pydhonie Police Station. At about 1.30 p.m.\n      the trap party received the pre-decided signal, on which the appellant\n      (A-21) was  searched,  however  he  was  not  carrying  any  arms  and\n      ammunition with him.  He was brought to the DCB, CID office and during\n      interrogation  he  expressed  his  willingness  to  make  a  voluntary\n      statement.  Therefore, two panchas were called from  the  nearby  area\n      and in their presence, the appellant (A-21)  disclosed   that  he  had\n      acquired two Carbines of foreign make and  some  arms  and  ammunition\n      from one Mujahidan and one of the said Carbine had been  concealed  at\n      Naryalwadi, Mazgaon.

The deposition of  Dayandeo Sonaji Geete (PW-320) has  been\n      fully corroborated by another police official Vijay Meru  (PW-561)  in\n      all respects. However, he has admitted that he had not made any  entry\n      in the Station Diary regarding the information received by Senior P.I.\n      Shri Kumbhar, nor he was aware how the panch witness arrived  and  who\n      was the police havaldar who brought the panch witnesses.  However,  he\n      (PW-561)  deposed  that  he  had  detained  the  appellant  (A-21)  on\n      information that  he  was  to  be  at  Pydhonie  for  acquiring  arms.\n      Appellant (A-21) came there at about 1.30  p.m.  and  on  getting  the\n      signal, the  police  party  pounced  upon  him  and  apprehended  him.\n      Appellant (A-21) was searched but he  was  not  carrying  any  weapon,\n      however, one Ceiko watch,  his driving licence,  labour  card  bearing\n      his photograph of Arab Emirates and some Dirhams  and  a  silver  ring\n      were found with him.  The inventory of the said articles was  prepared\n      and they were seized.  The currency in Dirhams was of the value of Rs.\n      13 to 14 thousand Indian rupees.  He was interrogated by  A.C.P.  Shri\n      Babar (PW-683) and  Senior  P.I.  Shri  Kumbhar.  It  was  during  his\n      interrogation that appellant (A-21) expressed his desire to  make  the\n      voluntary statement regarding  fire  arms.   Thus,  two  panches  were\n      called. The suspect was introduced to  the  panches.   The  memorandum\n      panchnama was prepared in respect of his disclosure statement.  It was\n      signed by panch witnesses  and, thus, he supported the recovery of the\n      articles as narrated by the  other  witnesses.    He  had  proved  the\n      complaint as well as the  proforma  FIR  on  the  basis  of  the  said\n      complaint. PW.561 registered the said offence as LAC No.  18  of  1993\n      against  the  appellant  (A-21)  for  the  offences  punishable  under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1092263/\" id=\"a_50\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/871582/\" id=\"a_51\">7</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 25</a> of the Arms Act.  Though he  was\n      competent to answer as to whether the panch witnesses had  been  stock\n      witnesses  or  whether  there  was  any  discrepancy  in  drawing  the\n      memorandum panchnama but defence did not ask any question  during  his\n      cross-examination.  He (PW-561) identified  the  appellant  (A-21)  on\n      24.4.1998 in the court and he has denied the suggestion  made  by  the\n      defence  that  the  appellant  (A-21)  had  not  made  any  disclosure\n      statement, nor the recovery of arms had been made  on  his  disclosure\n      statement.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_52\">      Deposition of Shivajirao Kondiram Babar, ACP (PW-683):\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      36.

He  had  received  the\n      information from a secret source on telephone, he  recorded  the  same\n      and passed on the same to the senior officers.   He  deposed  that  on\n      5.4.1993 while he was in  his  office  at  Crawford  Market,   he  had\n      received the information from his source on telephone  to  the  effect\n      that appellant (A-21) involved in Bombay blast case was in  possession\n      of  fire  arms  and  would  be  available  at  Pydhonie.   Immediately\n      thereafter, he formed a team of police officers and staff and went  to\n      the Pydhonie and arrested the appellant (A-21),  brought  him  to  the\n      office of DCB, CID at Crawford Market and he (A-21) was  interrogated.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_53\">      This witness further supported the prosecution case  that  he  made  a\n      desire to make confession voluntarily etc. etc.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_54\">      37.

Shri Mukul Gupta,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the\n      appellant, has submitted that in spite of the ample  evidence  against\n      the said respondents (A-20 and  A-21) in view of their involvement  in\n      conspiracy, the court below committed the grave  error  in  discarding\n      the same.    The  evidence  requires  total  re-appreciation  and  the\n      confessional statements of the respondents (A-20 and  A-21) and  other\n      co-accused have to be taken into consideration.

On the other hand, Shri Mushtaq Ahmad, learned counsel appearing\n      for the  respondents  (A-20  and   A-21),  has  submitted  that  their\n      confessional statements have rightly been discarded as  the  same  had\n      been recorded in utter disregard to  the  statutory  provisions.

We have considered rival submissions made by the counsel for the\n      parties and perused the records.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_66\">      46.   The confessional statements of Ahmad Shah Khan @ Salim Durani (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_67\">      20),  Shaikh Aziz Ahmed (A-21), Moiddin Abdul Kadar Cheruvattam (A-48)\n      and Ismail Abbas Patel (A-80) had been relied upon by the prosecution.\n       The same stood discarded completely by the learned Special  Judge  on\n      the ground that all the confessional statements had been  recorded  by\n      the Police officer in utter disregard to the mandatory  provisions  of\n      <a href=\"/doc/1972990/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 15</a> TADA and Rule 15 of TADA  Rules, 1987.  The police  officer\n      failed to inform  the  said  accused  persons  while  recording  their\n      respective statements that they were not bound  to  make  confessional\n      statement and  further  failed  to  warn  that,  in  case,  they  made\n      statements, the same would be used as evidence  against  them.    More\n      so, the required certificate was not attached to the said statements.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">      47.   This Court has laid down parameters for interference against the\n      order of acquittal time and again.  The  appellate  court  should  not\n      ordinarily set aside a judgment of acquittal in a case where two views\n      are possible, though the view of the appellate court may be  the  more\n      probable  one.  While  dealing  with  a  judgment  of  acquittal,  the\n      appellate court has to consider the entire evidence on record,  so  as\n      to arrive at a finding as to whether the views of the trial court were\n      perverse or otherwise unsustainable. The appellate court  is  entitled\n      to consider whether in arriving at a finding of fact, the trial  court\n      had failed to take into consideration admissible evidence  and/or  had\n      taken into consideration the evidence brought on  record  contrary  to\n      law. Similarly, wrong placing of burden of proof may also be a subject-\n      matter of scrutiny by the appellate court. In exceptional cases  where\n      there are compelling circumstances, and the judgment under  appeal  is\n      found to be perverse, the appellate court can interfere with the order\n      of acquittal. The appellate court should bear in mind the  presumption\n      of innocence of  the  accused  and  further  that  the  trial  court&#x27;s\n      acquittal bolsters the presumption of his innocence. Interference in a\n      routine manner where the other view is  possible  should  be  avoided,\n      unless there are good reasons for interference.  The findings of  fact\n      recorded by a court can be held to be perverse if  the  findings  have\n      been arrived at by ignoring  or  excluding  relevant  material  or  by\n      taking  into  consideration  irrelevant/inadmissible   material.   The\n      finding may also be said to be perverse if it is “against  the  weight\n      of evidence”, or if the finding so outrageously  defies  logic  as  to\n      suffer from the vice of irrationality.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">      48.   In view of the fact that no legal evidence which could be relied\n      upon by the prosecution is available on record, we  do  not  find  any\n      fault with the impugned judgment and order.

The  charge  against  the\n      respondent (A-31) had been  framed  mainly  for  conspiracy.

The respondent was present at the  instance  of\n      Tiger Memon and had transported the said contraband  in  his  vehicle.\n      Therefore, as the respondent had been  aware  of  the  nature  of  the\n      contraband, he cannot escape the liability of  charge  of  conspiracy.\n      Thus, the appeal deserves to be allowed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_95\">      65.

In order to negotiate\n      a safe  passage  for  the  smuggled  goods,  Mechanic  Chacha  (A-136)\n      offered him a sum of Rs.10 lakhs, and when they were asked  about  the\n      contents of the wooden boxes, Mechanic Chacha (A-136)  stated that the\n      same contained watches.  On the  said  day,  they  had  no  cash  and,\n      therefore, Mechanic Chacha (A-136)  took out five silver  bricks  from\n      the first truck and gave them to Shri Patil,  SI of  Shrivardhan.  The\n      appellant (A-30) drove Gurav’s jeep (A-82) and came to Kanghar.  There\n      they shifted 170 bricks in the cavities of  two  trucks  from  Bombay.\n      After loading the smuggled goods in the truck, the appellant  went  to\n      Shabbir’s residence alongwith  Salim  Kutta  (A-134),  Feroz  and  the\n      driver.

After  appreciating  the  evidence  on  record,   the   learned\n      Designated Court reached the following conclusions:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">           ?“……..However considering further events which  had  occurred  at\n           Ghonghar Patta i.e. interception of goods  by  police,  allowing\n           the  same  to  be  further  proceeded  after  negotiations  with\n           smugglers, presence of A-30 who was one of the main  person,  or\n           effecting landing, his role in the said episode, it is difficult\n           to perceive that at  the  said  juncture  A-30  would  not  have\n           gathered the knowledge of contraband material. Needless  to  add\n           that in cases of conspiracy it is difficult to  except  to  have\n           direct evidence and  the  inference  about  certain  aspects  is\n           required to be drawn from established facts &amp; circumstances.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">                  Thus having regard to all  the  aforesaid  facets  it  is\n           difficult to accept that at least at the said place  A-30  would\n           not have gathered the nature of contraband goods also sent along\n           with smugglers. It is true that the said further acts  committed\n           by A-30 being in the nature of continuing job for which  he  had\n           agreed i.e. effecting the silver landing the same may  not  make\n           him liable for being party  to  the  conspiracy  to  commit  the\n           terrorist act or the larger conspiracy for which the  charge  at\n           head 1st ly is framed. Such a conclusion is  obvious  as  hardly\n           there exists any other material denoting that  alter  completion\n           of job of landing &amp; transportation, A-30  having  committed  any\n           act furthering object of ally conspiracy. However, still now the\n             further act being committed by A-30 being  with  an  expressed\n           knowledge that the contraband material  was  containing  arms  &amp;\n           ammunitions he will be squarely liable for commission of offence\n           u/s 3 (3) of TADA. Similarly the quantity of  the  said  arms  &amp;\n           ammunition and the further acts actually committed by A-30 would\n           also make him liable for commission of offence<a href=\"/doc/1886064/\" id=\"a_71\"> u/s.6</a>  TADA.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">           ……… ?Thus considering  the  said  aspect  it  will  be  extremely\n           difficult to accept that policemen would  not  have  been  aware\n           about the nature of said goods in trucks which were in the  said\n           trucks i.e. silver and arms  &amp;  ammunitions  as  established  by\n           evidence. Such an  inference  is  inevitable  as  such  evidence\n           pertaining to landing clearly denotes of the material  being  of\n           two different categories i.e. boxes and bachkies  i.e.  bundles.\n           Having regard to the same  it  is  difficult  to  perceive  that\n           during inspection of trucks at least parcels from each  category\n           would not have been inspected by policemen.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">           …….Having regard to aforesaid even assuming  that  police  party\n           had permitted the said trucks to proceed away without inspection\n           then also they cannot escape the liability arising out  of  said\n           illegal omission committed by them.

The confession of A-134 does not show that the appellant  (A-30)\n      was aware of the contents  of  the  contraband  goods  were  arms  and\n      ammunition, either prior  to  the  landing  or  thereafter.   However,\n      considering the event of interception of the said goods by the  police\n      and  the  presence  and  involvement  of  the  appellant   (A-30)   in\n      negotiations with the police for clearing the said smuggled goods,  it\n      is difficult to believe, that at the said time, the  appellant  (A-30)\n      did not have knowledge regarding the contraband material.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_153\">            The confession of A-133 however  reveals  that  he  (A-133)  had\n      overheard  the  appellant  (A-30)  discussing  the  contents  of   the\n      contraband after the items had landed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_154\">            In case of conspiracy, it is difficult to find  direct  evidence\n      and thus, inference is required to be drawn from established facts and\n      circumstances.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_155\">            Hence, it is difficult to accept, that in the said circumstances\n      the appellant (A-30) was unaware of the nature of the smuggled  goods.\n       The acts that were further committed by the appellant (A-30), were in\n      the nature of continuing his job in effecting the landing  of  silver,\n      and the same may not make him liable as a party to the  conspiracy  to\n      commit terrorist acts. However, certain other acts that were committed\n      by him (A-30), with the express knowledge that the contraband material\n      did in fact contain arms and ammunition, would  make  him  liable  for\n      commission of  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_76\">Section  3(3)</a>  TADA.  Furthermore,  the\n      quantity of arms and ammunition, and the further acts committed by the\n      appellant would also make him liable for commission of  offence  under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1886064/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 6</a>  TADA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_156\">      94.   The examination of the appellant (A-30)  under  <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_78\">Section  313</a>  of\n      Cr.P.C. reveals that he had assisted in the landing of goods at  Dighi\n      Jetty on 9.1.1993, and that he had taken the stand of  being  involved\n      in the landings of silver even prior to the said event,  and  that  he\n      did not know the nature of the goods that  were  landed  in  the  said\n      landing.   The evidence of PWs 95 and 97 corroborates the   fact  that\n      landing had occurred at the  said  time  and  place.   Their  evidence\n      reveals that the goods were packed in  boxes,  or  in  green  coloured\n      cloth bag that had been tied at the mouth, and that  thus,  they  were\n      not aware of the contents.  They  had  acted  at  the  behest  of  the\n      appellant (A-30) for which they had received payment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_157\">      95.   The appellant (A-30) was aware that  the  smuggled   goods  were\n      arms and ammunition, and even after acquiring such knowledge,  he  had\n      continued the landing of the said  smuggled  goods.   This  makes  him\n      liable for commission of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 3(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1886064/\" id=\"a_80\">6</a>  TADA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_158\">      96.

The evidence on record made it crystal clear that A-30  was  not\n      only a close associate of Tiger Memon (AA) and  acting  as  a  landing\n      agent, but a man of confidence who could negotiate with the police and\n      customs officials to fix the amount  of  bribe  for  facilitating  the\n      smuggling and transportation of the  smuggled  contraband.  He  was  a\n      person who had negotiated with the police at Gondghar  Phata.  He  had\n      been fully aware of the nature of contraband, and in spite  of  coming\n      to know that the contraband contained arms, ammunition and explosives,\n      he continued to help the smugglers. It is also  evident  that  he  had\n      close association with Jaywant Keshav Gurav  (A-82),  officer  of  the\n      customs department, who had been helping the  smugglers  by  taking  a\n      bribe through A-30. Therefore, in view of the above, we do not  concur\n      with the findings of fact recorded by  the  learned  Designated  Court\n      that A-30 could not be convicted for conspiracy.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_161\">      99.

It could not be accepted that the  appellant\n      (A-46) was not aware of illegal business of Tiger Memon (AA)  or about\n      the nature of the contrabands smuggled into India. The presence of the\n      appellant (A-46) at the place  where  the  goods  were  exchanged,  at\n      Wangni  Tower  and   concealed   into   cavities   of   vehicles   for\n      transportation to Bombay, shows  that he was a person  of  very  close\n      confident of Tiger Memon (AA).

He has stated that he knew of a person named  Anwar,  who  had\n      lived in close proximity to his house  right  from  his  childhood.  A\n      relative of the appellant (A-18)   had  asked  him  whether  he  would\n      travel to Ajmer Sharif along with Anwar in a Maruti Car. He  had  thus\n      gone to Ajmer driving the  said  vehicle  with  Anwar,  who  had  been\n      working with Tiger Memon (AA) and was also being paid by him.  A tempo\n      bearing No. MMP-4799, belonging  to  a  decorator  was  given  to  the\n      appellant (A-18) on 5.2.1993. The said vehicle had been driven by  him\n      to take Sayyed Abdul Rehman Shaikh (A-28) and  Abdul  Gani  (A-11)  to\n      Mhasla. Dawood Taklya (A-14) and Dadabhai (A-17) were already  present\n      at Mhasla. Fifty-sixty  packets were loaded into the said vehicle. The\n      said packets were dug out from the land.  When  the  appellant  (A-18)\n      touched these packets, he realised that they did  not  contain  silver\n      smuggled from abroad. After collecting the  aforementioned  goods,  he\n      left for Bombay alongwith co-accused (A-55). When they reached Panvel,\n      he realized that Tiger Memon (AA) had also come there in a Maruti car,\n      and as per his instructions, they had then  driven  to  the  house  of\n      Dawood Taklya (A-14)  in Mhasla in order to  leave  the  tempo  there.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_211\">      After  some  time,  the  appellant  (A-18)  had  returned  to  Bombay,\n      alongwith Gani (A-11) and others.  After 2-3 days on 9.2.1993, he  had\n      gone to Mahad driving the said vehicle and  had reached there at noon.\n      He had seen a Maruti car and two jeeps  parked  there,  and  also  saw\n      Tiger Memon (AA), Yakub Haji, Anwar, Javed Chikna, Gani, Shafi and 5-6\n      other boys. Shafi asked the appellant (A-18) to stop the  tempo  at  a\n      petrol pump situated between Goregaon and  Madgaon.   At  about  6  o’\n      clock in the evening, two boys had come there  in  a  tempo,  and  had\n      asked the appellant (A-18) to take the said tempo to the Mhasla tower.\n      The appellant (A-18) had then taken the vehicle to  Mhasla  tower  and\n      had reached there at about 9.30 pm.

After due consideration of the entire evidence  on  record,  the\n      Designated Court came to the conclusion that as the  appellant  (A-18)\n      was involved in the Shekhadi landings operation, he has committed  the\n      offence under <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_88\">section 3(3)</a> TADA. The evidence has also established his\n      involvement in commission of the offence of conspiracy with the object\n      of committing terrorist acts, as the appellant (A-18)  had  been  made\n      aware of the nature of the smuggled goods and  had  still  transported\n      the same. The said act amounts to furthering the object of  conspiracy\n      to commit terrorist acts. However it has been held that the  appellant\n      (A-18) himself has not committed any act and that he himself  has  not\n      participated in any conspiratorial meetings, to  denote  that  he  was\n      actually a party to the conspiracy to commit serial bomb  Blast  or  a\n      party to the larger conspiracy i.e. the first charge.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_228\">      142.  So far as the appellant (A-18) is concerned, undoubtedly,  there\n      is  sufficient  evidence  to  show  that  he  was  involved   in   the\n      transportation of contraband. From the facts and circumstances of  the\n      case, and after taking into consideration the evidence on record,   it\n      cannot be inferred that despite being a close associate of Tiger Memon\n      (AA),  he  remained  unaware  of  the  nature   of   the   contraband.\n      Furthermore, when a person has been transporting   goods  for  a  long\n      period of time it is difficult to believe that he would transport  the\n      said goods, without ascertaining  the  exact  nature  of  goods  being\n      loaded into his vehicle, particularly, in view of the fact  that   the\n      vehicle is likely to be checked at several places by  the  police,  as\n      well as by custom officials. Thus, we do not see any cogent reason  to\n      hold that the appellant (A-18) is not guilty of the charges for  which\n      he has been punished by the Designated  Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_229\">      II.

In  his  confessional  statement,  he   has\n      disclosed that he was a driver by profession and that he had a driving\n      licence. He had known Tiger Memon  (AA) for the  last 6-7  months  and\n      also Anwar, Gani (A-11), Rafique Madi and Haji Yakub. Hazi Yakub was a\n      friend of Anwar’s. He had gone to Ajmer alongwith the other co-accused\n      Suleman and Anwar in April 1992, for smuggling activities.  After  2-3\n      months of his visit to Ajmer, upon  the  instructions  of  Anwar,  the\n      appellant (A-28)  had  reached  Bandra  station  with  one  change  of\n      clothes.  Shafi and Suleman had come there in a Maruti car,  in  which\n      he (A-28) had also driven alongwith them,  till  Linking  Road.   From\n      there, the appellant (A-28) alongwith the others had gone to  an  open\n      theatre by way of taking a jeep.  Tiger Memon (AA) had  arrived  there\n      alongwith Imtiyaz and Anwar  in a blue coloured Maruti car. Anwar  had\n      instructed the appellant (A-28) to follow the car of Tiger Memon (AA),\n      and they had gone to Panvel and had reached the Welcome  Hotel.  Anwar\n      had gone with Tiger Memon (AA).  Imtiyaz and the appellant (A-28) were\n      directed to reach the tower  alongwith the other co-accused. They  had\n      gone to Goregaon, Raigad and had slept there at night. At  about  3.30\n      in the morning, Tiger Memon  (AA)  had  come  with  a  truck  carrying\n      Imtiyaz, Anwar, Dadabhai (A-17), Dawoodbhai  (A-14)  and  about  20-25\n      labourers.  The appellant (A-28) had woken up and realized that  there\n      were also two more jeeps and one truck.  Silver  bricks  were  removed\n      from the truck that had been brought by Tiger Memon and the same  were\n      loaded into  all the vehicles standing at the tower.  The appellant (A-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_237\">      28) alongwith Rafique Madi, had  taken    18  silver  bricks  and  had\n      thereafter, proceeded towards Hyderabad.  In Kolhapur, they had handed\n      over the goods to Pradeep Chandra Jain and had thereafter, returned to\n      Bombay with an empty vehicle.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_238\">            After this, on  5.2.1993  at  about  12.30  A.M.,  when  he  was\n      returning from shooting (as he has claimed that he worked  in  movies,\n      particularly in stunts), he had been called by Tiger Memon  (AA),  and\n      had been asked to go to Mhasla. Yeda Yakub who  was  also  there,  had\n      given him the keys to a Matador tempo, which belonged to Abdul  Samad,\n      a decorator in Mahim.  He had gone to Mhasla alongwith Suleman  (A-18)\n      and Gani (A-11) and there he had  met Dawood Bhai who  had taken  them\n      near the tower, and had told them that the goods had been  kept  in  a\n      pit, and that it would take some time to remove  them.  Dawood  (A-14)\n      had then  asked him, alongwith the others to return at  around  7-7.30\n      a.m. with a vehicle.  From there he had gone to the house  of  a  lady\n      (school teacher) in Mhasla Village, and  had  eaten  and  also  rested\n      there. In the evening, they had gone to the tower. It was  a  moon-lit\n      night, and at  the  said  time  Dawood  (A-14)  and  Dadabhai  (A-17),\n      alongwith their 10-15 servants had come there  and  had  proceeded  to\n      load the goods, i.e. 55-60  sacks  into  the  vehicle  that  had  been\n      brought by him. Some empty sacks were also put in  after  folding  the\n      same over the goods. They had  then  gone  to  the  Welcome  Hotel  at\n      Panvel. Tiger Memon had also come there. Tiger Memon had sent Gani (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_239\">      11) and Suleman (A-18) to the Persian Darbar Hotel. Then  Tiger  Memon\n      had gone inside the Welcome Hotel with the appellant (A-28), they  had\n      met one fair and tall person who had brown eyes. The appellant  (A-28)\n      had been introduced to him by Tiger Memon (AA), and was also  directed\n      to work in accordance with  his  instructions.  On  being  asked,  the\n      appellant (A-28) had disclosed that he (A-28) had also seen the  Delhi\n      Darbar Hotel in Dahisar Check Naka. Then, the fair tall man  had  told\n      the appellant (A-28) to park the said vehicle in front of  the  hotel,\n      on the other side of the road and had told him that one Shakeel (A-59)\n      would meet him there, who would then unload the vehicle.  As  per  the\n      instructions of Shakeel, the appellant (A-28) had  proceeded  to  park\n      the vehicle. A Nepali had  then  come  there,  and  some  persons  had\n      unloaded the goods from the vehicle and  had  then  brought  the  said\n      vehicle back to  the Delhi Darbar Hotel, after which, the appellant (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_240\">      28) had left for Virar  in the said vehicle.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_241\">            Subsequently on 8.2.1993, at about 6-6.30 in the evening,  Anwar\n      had met the appellant (A-28) at Bandra Talab naka and had   asked  him\n      to go to Mhasla again.  The appellant (A-28) had gone  there alongwith\n      Yakub. Tiger Memon (AA) had also arrived there after  about  one  hour\n      alongwith a jeep.  He  had  given  the  jeep  to  Suleman  (A-18)  and\n      thereafter,  told  him  to  leave.  The  appellant  (A-28)  upon   the\n      instructions of Tiger Memon (AA), had returned  alongwith the  vehicle\n      and had handed over the said vehicle to Gani (A-11)  and  returned  to\n      Bandra Talab. Anwar had then paid Rs.5,000/- to the  appellant  (A-28)\n      in the evening, in lieu of the aforementioned job. The  appellant  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_242\">      28) had thus been working continuously for Tiger  Memon.  However,  he\n      had been unaware  of the contents or nature of the goods. It was  only\n      after the Bombay Blast had taken place on 12.3.1993,  and  when  Tiger\n      Memon’s name had appeared in  the newspapers, that the  appellant  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_243\">      28) had realised that he had committed a  mistake by participating  in\n      the said landing and  transportation,  as  he  thought  that  perhaps,\n      instead of silver and gold, it had actually  been  weapons  that  were\n      smuggled in by him.  He was arrested during the shooting of  a  movie,\n      in which he was working.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_244\">      150.

The  said  witness  identified   the\n      confessional statement of A-28 in court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_251\">      156.  Deposition of Vijay Govind More (PW.137) – He  deposed  that  he\n      was working as labourer at Wangni Tower.  He  wrongly  identified  the\n      appellant (A-28) as Anwar and in his statement did not name  appellant\n      (A-28)   but  corroborated  in  general  particulars  in  respect   of\n      transportation of goods smuggled  at Shekhadi.  He  also  stated  that\n      goods were unloaded at Wangni Tower and shifted in another vehicle and\n      at that time Tiger Memon (AA) and Dawood Taklya  (A-14)  among  others\n      were present.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_252\">      157.  Dileep M. Katarmal (PW.284) in his statement has deposed that A-\n      17 has purchased a few dozens gunny bags from  his shop on  10.2.1993,\n      though he did not  name  the  appellant  (A-28)  specifically  but  he\n      corroborated in general particulars the confession of appellant (A-28)\n      wherein he stated that he alongwith Najeeb had  purchased  1500  sacks\n      from the said shop.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_253\">      158.  Considering the material contained  in  the  confession  of  the\n      appellant (A-28), and in those of the  aforesaid  co-accused,  it  was\n      held that the same  leads  to  the  inescapable  conclusion  that  the\n      appellant (A-28) had infact been  involved  in  the  Shekhadi  landing\n      operation, and had thus committed the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_91\">section 3(3)</a> TADA.\n      The evidence also establishes his involvement in the commission of the\n      offence of conspiracy to commit terrorist acts since the appellant (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_254\">      28) was certainly aware of the nature of the contraband material,  and\n      had still transported the same, the said act amounts to furthering the\n      object of the conspiracy to commit terrorist acts.  However,   it  was\n      held that the appellant (A-28) had not committed any acts and had  not\n      participated in any conspiratorial meetings, to  denote  that  he  had\n      been a party to the  conspiracy to commit the serial bomb Blast or the\n      larger conspiracy i.e. the  first charge.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_255\">      159.  So far as the appellant (A-28) is  concerned,  his  confessional\n      statement which stands corroborated by the confessional statements  of\n      the other co-accused, particularly, Abdul  Gani  Ismail  Turk  (A-11),\n      Dawood @ Dawood Taklya (A-14), Imtiyaz Yunusmiya Ghavte (A-15), Sharif\n      Abdul Gafoor Parkar @  Dadabhai  (A-17)  and  Shahnawaz  Khan  (A-128)\n      reveals  his  involvement  in  the  Shekhadi   landing   and   further\n      establishes that he had been fully aware of the nature of contents  of\n      the contraband and had  still  transported  the  same.   Such  an  act\n      tantamounts to furthering the  object  of  the  conspiracy  to  commit\n      terrorist acts. Taking into consideration his close  association  with\n      Tiger Memon (AA) and his associates, with respect to  their  smuggling\n      activities, it is difficult to believe that  he  was  unaware  of  the\n      nature of the contents. Thus,  we are of the view that he has  rightly\n      been convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_92\">Section 3(3)</a> TADA by the Designated Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_256\">      III.

Appellant (A-62)  after his duty left Wangni Tower  for\n      his residence and returned at about 7.30 to 8.30 p.m.  At  about  9.30\n      p.m three persons came by a Maruti car at Wangni Tower.  Out of  them,\n      Sarfaraj Phanse called for appellant (A-62) and asked him  to  arrange\n      for tea.  Appellant and the witness prepared tea.  Subsequently, Tiger\n      Memon, Dawood  Phanse,  Sharif  Adhikari,  Abdul  Gharatkar,  Dadamiya\n      Parkar also came there.  At about 11 p.m.,  a  truck  came  at  Wangni\n      Tower.  Following the same, one tempo and two jeeps also arrived.  The\n      goods which had been brought in the said truck were loaded into  jeeps\n      and tempo and then all the vehicles left the Tower.  Again in February\n      1993 when the witness was on duty, the appellant (A-62) told him  that\n      goods of Dawood Phanse had to arrive.  After the duty hours, appellant\n      (A-62) went to his house and  again  returned  to  the  tower  in  the\n      evening.  At about 8.30 p.m., three persons came by  a  car.

Just  thereafter,  Dawood\n      Phanse and his companions arrived in a jeep.  This witness  identified\n      the appellant (A-62) and other accused, namely,  accused  nos.14,  17,\n      28, 42, 60, 61 and 73.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_291\">      185.

The appellant (A-62) being a watchman\n      of the Wangni Tower i.e. government premises, had allowed the same  to\n      be used for purpose of facilitating the smuggling and landing of arms,\n      ammunition, hand grenades and explosives that was organized  by  Tiger\n      Memon (AA) and his associates. The appellant (A-62) had also permitted\n       the co-accused to conceal 59 bags of RDX  explosives  in  his  field.\n      Hence he was held guilty for the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 3(3)</a>\n       TADA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_292\">      186.

The evidence  further  establishes  his  involvement   in\n      concealing 59 bags of RDX explosives in a field existing in his  name.\n      Thus, he has rightly been convicted by the learned Special Judge under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 3(3)</a> TADA and <a href=\"/doc/162723/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 202</a> IPC.

The confession of the appellant  (A-73)  was  recorded  by  Shri\n      Vinod Balwant Lokhande, D.C., Airport Zone, Bombay  on  15.5.1993  and\n      17.5.1993.  In his confessional statement, the  appellant  (A-73)  has\n      disclosed that he has been working in the garage of his maternal uncle\n      since his childhood.  His uncle had handed over the garage to  him  27\n      years ago.  He  had  been   running  the  said  garage  for  repairing\n      vehicles.  He knew Tiger Memon (AA) and his associates Sunil,  Shaffi,\n      Imtiyaz, Anwar, Rafique Madi, Raju Marwari, Riyaz, Majeed  etc.   They\n      would do the work of smuggling silver.  The same was unloaded  at  the\n      sea-shore near the village Mhasla.  The goods were to  be  brought  by\n      trucks to the Tower, and the contraband were then to be  unloaded  and\n      concealed  in the cavities of tempos and jeeps there.  The work of the\n      appellant (A-73) was to take the tempo or the jeep  full  of  smuggled\n      silver to its destination, and after  this,  he  was  paid  a  sum  of\n      Rs.2,000 to 3,000 for each transportation/landing.  In the  last  week\n      of January, 1993 he had reached the Welcome  Hotel,  Panvel  alongwith\n      the jeep at 8.30 p.m.  upon receiving  instructions  to  this  effect.\n      Four jeeps and a Maruti car were  already  parked  there.   Tiger  and\n      Sunil were also sitting in the jeep.  The goods were  smuggled in  the\n      next day with the help of a large number of persons  including  Tiger,\n      Shaffi, Anwar, Imtiyaz, Gani and Rafique  etc.   The  truck  was  then\n      unloaded, and all goods were kept in the tempos and jeeps.  There were\n      several green coloured boxes containing black  soap,  and  cartridges.\n      The appellant (A-73) had parked  the  tempo  full  of  smuggled  goods\n      outside his garage in Islampura.  The appellant (A-73) had  then  gone\n      to Persian Darbar  Hotel  upon  being  called  by  Tiger  Memon.   The\n      appellant (A-73) was asked by Tiger Memon to take  the  tempo  outside\n      his garage to Sankhvi street, opposite  Bata  Company,  near  Lokhandi\n      gate near the place  where  Chiliyaki  Hotel  was  situated.   He  was\n      informed that there would be a boy at the gate who would  give  him  a\n      signal with a white handkerchief  upon  seeing  the  said  tempo.  The\n      appellant (A-73) was told to take the vehicle as  per  his  direction,\n      and unload the goods there.  The next day, the  appellant  (A-73)  had\n      taken the tempo to Sankhvi Street  to the aforesaid address,   and  as\n      per the direction, the goods were unloaded there.  He had  been   paid\n      Rs.1000 for this work.

All the material on evidence was collected and after  appraisal,\n      the Special Judge came to the conclusion that A-73 had  in  fact  been\n      involved in the landing operations of the contraband  substances.  The\n      evidence against appellant (A-73) includes his own confession  wherein\n      he has confessed to being fully aware of the fact that the  contraband\n      were shifted from trucks to  other  vehicles,  which  contained  arms,\n      ammunition and RDX. The Designated Court came to the  conclusion  that\n      his act of driving the vehicle containing such material could  not  be\n      for any purpose other than to aid and abet terrorist activities.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_307\">            However, the Designated Court has stated that the said acts  had\n      been  committed by him in the early phases  of  the  conspiracy,  even\n      prior to Tiger Memon (AA) deciding the target of the Blast. The  court\n      also went on to say that after this particular incident A-73  had  not\n      been involved in any landing job. Therefore, he (A-73) cannot be  held\n      guilty for the larger conspiracy, for which the  charge  firstly,  was\n      framed against him.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_308\">      199.  So far as appellant (A-73) is concerned, like other  appellants,\n      his involvement and participation in the  landing  operations  of  the\n      contraband  substances  has  been  clearly   established.    His   own\n      confessional statement has revealed that he, being fully aware of  the\n      contents of the contraband, shifted the same from the truck  to  other\n      vehicles and that  in  spite  of  the  fact  that  he  knew  that  the\n      contraband contained arms, ammunition and  RDX,  he  continued  to  be\n      associated with the other co-accused.  Therefore,  he  has  aided  and\n      abetted terrorist activities, and we do not see any cogent  reason  to\n      interfere with his order of conviction as recorded by  the  Designated\n      Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_309\">      200.

In view of same though A-73 is found to be\n           guilty for offence of conspiracy the same would be conspiracy to\n           commit terrorist act punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 3(3)</a> of TADA or in\n           other words he cannot be held liable for larger  conspiracy  for\n           which charge at head 1stly is framed against him.”\n\n\n           ?\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_330\">      215.

As Harish  Chandra  Surve  (PW.108)\n      and Vijay Govind More (PW.137) had also been working in the same tower\n      as employees, the  respondent  had  persuaded  them  for  helping  the\n      smugglers.

Tiger Memon (AA)  and  his  associates  Iqbal,  Mobin,  Anwar,\n      Munna, Shafi  were  accompanying  the  vehicles.  Silver  bricks  were\n      shifted from the truck into the tempo.   There  were  gunny  bags  and\n      boxes covered with clothes also and about 50 bags out of the aforesaid\n      goods remained unloaded.  The said bags were taken  by  the  truck  of\n      Alware in the field which was in his name and were  concealed  in  the\n      pits by putting soil on it.  Dawood Phanse (A-14) had  told  him  that\n      the contraband was “Kala Sabun”, and he was warned not to disclose the\n      same to any one.  Tiger Memon  (AA)  cut  one  bundle  from  the  said\n      bundles, and saw the same to ascertain whether the goods  were  proper\n      or not.  He threw the plastic at that place and  packed  the  same  in\n      another bundle and took the same with  him.  Thereafter,  on  7.1.1993\n      again Dawood Phanse had informed the respondent (A-62) that goods were\n      about to arrive and this was being informed to  Harish  Chandra  Surve\n      (PW.108) and Vijay Govind More (PW.137).  One truck, three jeeps,  one\n      rickshaw and  two  motor  cycles  came  there  alongwith  the  accused\n      persons, namely, Dawood Phanse (A-14), Dadamiya Parkar (A-17),  Sharif\n      Adhikari (A-60), Abdul Gharatkar (A-34) and Tiger Memon (AA).  After 5-\n      6  days  Dawood  Phanse  (A-14)   had  paid  him  Rs.2,000/-  for  the\n      assistance. Dawood Phanse (A-14) used to give an amount  of  Rs.1000/-\n      for each of them i.e. accused, Harish Chandra Surve (PW.108) and Vijay\n      Govind More (PW.137).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_349\">      230.

The evidence against the respondent Sujjad Alam  @  Iqbal  Abdul\n      Hakim  Nazir  (A-61)  is  his  own  confession.  In  his  confessional\n      statement, he had disclosed that his maternal uncle Khalil  Ali  Nazir\n      had been involved in  landing  of  silver  for  Tiger  Memon  (AA)  at\n      Shekhadi Beach.  Accused (A-61) used to take Dawood Taklya (A-14)  and\n      Abdul Aziz Gharatkar to the place of landing  in  his  auto  rickshaw.\n      Accused (A-61) participated in the landing and transportation  of  the\n      contraband.  Accused (A-61) was paid Rs. 2000/-  per  landing  through\n      Khalil. On 20th January, 1993, Accused (A-61) went to the residence of\n      his maternal uncle and found Khalil, Muzammil, Shafi and other Khalil,\n      resident of Shrivardhan present there.  They were shifting some  goods\n      wrapped in gunny bags from the jeep to a room.  At that time,  son  of\n      Dawood Taklya Sarfaraz (A-55) was also there.  Shafi, driver of  Tiger\n      Memon(AA), asked accused (A-61) to leave the room.  When  they  opened\n      the gunny bags inside the room,  accused  (A-61)  saw  that  the  bags\n      contained  16  rifles  and  32  cassettes  (magazines).  After  coming\n      outside, A-61 saw that Khalil, resident of  Shrivardhan,  was  closing\n      secret cavities in the jeep. Shafi then took that jeep towards Mhasla.\n      The accused (A-61), Khalil and Muzammil took the said arms, ammunition\n      in the auto rickshaw of Muzammil at  the  residence  of  Muzammil  and\n      dropped the same there. On 3rd February, 1993, his uncle Khalil  asked\n      him to help in the landing of contraband for Tiger Memon (AA)  in  the\n      night. So A-61 went to the place  of  landing  in  his  auto  rickshaw\n      alongwith Dawood Taklya (A-14) and Abdul Aziz.  After reaching  there,\n      he found 2-3  jeeps  carrying  Tiger  Memon  (AA)  and  20-25  of  his\n      associates. The accused (A-61) was then directed to reach Tower,  upon\n      which, he left to wake the people there.  On reaching  the  place  the\n      accused (A-61) parked the vehicle on one side of the tower  and  slept\n      on the back seat. After a long time, Muzammil came to the vehicle  and\n      woke him up. Rashid and Khalil also came there.  By that time, all the\n      vehicles from Shekhadi had arrived.  The  associates  of  Tiger  Memon\n      (AA) were unloading and shifting the articles inside  the  Tower.  The\n      accused (A-61) was forbidden to enter inside.  After sometime, Dawood,\n      Khalil, Abdul Aziz and accused (A-61)  left  the  Tower  in  the  auto\n      rickshaw. It was in the  evening  of  9th  February,  1993,  that  the\n      accused (A-61) took Dawood Taklya in his auto  rikshaw  to  Mehandari.\n      From there they took Khalil  Nazir  from  his  residence  and  reached\n      Muzammil’s residence. On  being  asked  by  Dawood  Taklya,   Muzammil\n      handed over 3 rifles and 6 cassettes in a gunny bag.   All  the  three\n      accused then took the said weapons and ammunition and came  to  Lonery\n      Phatta on the highway via Goregaon and handed over the same  to  Tiger\n      Memon (AA), who had arrived there.  After 4-5 days, Dawood Taklya sent\n      Rs.4000/- for both the landings.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_362\">      239.  Confessional statement of Mohd. Phanse @ Dawood Taklya (A-14)  –\n      His statement corroborated the version given  by  the  accused  (A-61)\n      about the landing at Shekhadi and disclosed the role of accused (A-61)\n      as  a  participant  in  the  landing  and  his  facilitation  in   the\n      transportation.  According to him, Tiger Memon (AA) was there with 20-\n      25 persons.  Out of them 8-10 persons were carrying pistols  in  their\n      pockets. Immediately, after the arrival of trawler, accused (A-61) was\n      sent alongwith his auto rickshaw to call Rashid from  Borli  with  his\n      truck so he left.  The goods were unloaded  and  put  in  the  trucks.\n      Immediately, another trawler arrived carrying  the  goods  which  were\n      also unloaded.  Tiger Memon (AA) made 2-3 boys carrying  guns  to  sit\n      over the goods which were loaded in the truck. Then they  had  reached\n      Wangni Tower, where the goods were unloaded. When they went inside the\n      Tower, he saw the men of Tiger Memon  (AA)  opening  those  boxes  and\n      putting rifles, pistols, bullets, black wire, handgrenades and bundles\n      of wire with white pencil on top and “black soap” like material at the\n      side. Tiger Memon (AA) was sitting at  their  side  and  counting  and\n      noting things in his diary. Once the landing  and  transportation  was\n      over, co-accused (A-14) came back to his village alongwith accused (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_363\">      61) in his auto rickshaw.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_364\">      240.

Then  the\n      acccused (A-61) was sent to village Borli with autorickshaw  to  bring\n      the truck and labourers.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_365\">      241.  Confession of Muzammil Umar Kadri  (A-25)  –  On  3rd  February,\n      1993, this accused (A-25) on being called reached in front of Bashir’s\n      house in Borli.  Accused  (A-61)  auto  rickshawala  also  came  there\n      sometime later after dropping  Dawood  Taklya  (A-14)  and  Khalil  at\n      Shekhadi.  Sometime later, Khalil had come alongwith another Khalil of\n      Shrivardhan on his scooter.  Khalil sent accused (A-61) to  the  tower\n      just before the jeep came and  accused (A-25) also went to  the  tower\n      alongwith Khalil by following  the  truck.   On  7th  February,  1993,\n      Dawood Taklya (A-14) had taken him in the auto rickshaw of accused (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_366\">      61), to Shekhadi.  In the morning of 7th February, 1993 Dawood  Taklya\n      (A-14) had come in the rickshaw of accused (A-61) and  took  3  rifles\n      and 6 cassettes which  had  been  kept  in  his  house  earlier.   The\n      remaining 13 rifles and 26 cassettes had been recovered  later  on  by\n      the police from his house.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_367\">      242.

Accused (A-61) was also with them.  He also  identified\n      the accused (A-61) in court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_368\">      243.

In addition, the Designated Court also  reached  the  conclusion\n      that the accused (A-61) had  no  knowledge  about  the  use  to  which\n      weapons were to be put into.  In awarding the  punishment,  the  court\n      took into consideration the role played by the respondent  (A-61)  and\n      concluded that charge for larger conspiracy could not be made out.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_370\">      245.  It is evident that he was not allowed to enter into  the  Wangni\n      tower and thus he had no knowledge that arms had  been  smuggled  into\n      India to be used in Bombay Blast, and further, the fact that the  arms\n      were kept in the house of Muzammil, and the arms  and  ammunition  had\n      been transported in the vehicle belonging to Muzammil and not  in  the\n      vehicle of accused (A-61).  There is nothing on record  to  show  that\n      accused (A-61) had participated in loading and unloading of the  same.\n      His rickshaw had been used for  carrying  the  accused  persons.   The\n      accused (A-61) had transported the arms, i.e. 3 rifles and 6 cassettes\n      alongwith  Dawood  Taklya  from  the  house  of  Muzammil  which  were\n      subsequently taken  from him by Tiger Memon (AA).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_371\">      246.

Therefore, while determining the quantum of punishment  the\n      precise  act  committed  by  an  individual  accused   is   of   prime\n      consideration.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_372\">      247.  In the instant case,  appellant (A-61) had been found guilty  on\n      the single count of participating in  landing  on  two  occasions  and\n      additionally  of  being  involved  in  the  concealment  of  arms  and\n      ammunition at the house of A-25 and further for the transportation  of\n      some arms from the house of A-25 to Lonery Phata and handing over  the\n      same to Tiger Memon (AA).

Thus,  the  contraband\n      materials recovered on the disclosure statement  of  these  appellants\n      were further wrapped in newspapers.

In their  confessional  statements,  Uttam  Shantaram\n      Potdar (A-30) and Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A-82),    have  not  made  any\n      reference to the smuggling of arms and ammunition, infact,  they  have\n      spoken of the smuggling of silver. Therefore, the question of  framing\n      any charge against the present appellants under TADA, in view of  such\n      confessional statements could not  arise.   Moreover,  the  memorandum\n      annexed to the confessional statement is a  part  and  parcel  of  the\n      confession,  and the same has to be filled up simultaneously, and  not\n      subsequently.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_484\">            So far as the confessional statement of Uttam  Shantaram  Potdar\n      (A-30) is concerned, the said memorandum had been  sent  subsequently.\n      Thus, the same was in violation of the statutory  provisions  of  TADA\n      and, the TADA Rules, particularly, as the same was not  in  compliance\n      with the requirements of <a href=\"/doc/925052/\" id=\"a_163\">sections 15(3)(b)</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1972990/\" id=\"a_164\">15(5)</a>  of   the  TADA\n      Rules.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_485\">            The said confessional statement  required  a  certificate  under\n      Rule 15(4), and such a certificate was  not  annexed  by  the  officer\n      recording the confessional statements of Uttam  Shantaram  Potdar  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_486\">      30), Jaywant  Keshav  Gurav  (A-82)  and  Salim  Kutta  (A-134).

They had not checked the  boxes,  they  had  only\n      counted the bricks in the trucks.  The previous  amount  of  bribe  of\n      Rs.25,000/-  was enhanced to a sum of Rs.10 lakhs  after a negotiation\n      of about half an hour.

This  police  party  further\n      allowed  the  goods  to  go  past,  without  proper   checking   after\n      negotiating a bribe to the tune of Rs.7 lakhs. As  the  smugglers  did\n      not have said amount of Rs.7 lakhs with them at the  said  time,  they\n      had given five silver bricks that had been smuggled in the landing, to\n      the police as security and subsequently, upon making them  payment  of\n      the said amount to the officials, the silver bricks had been  returned\n      to the smugglers.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_492\">      Confessional statement of Uttam Potdar (A-30):\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_493\">      329.  He has stated that on 9.1.1993, at night, after the smuggling of\n      the goods, they had been intercepted by the  Shrivardhan  police  near\n      Gondghar  Phata.  Upon  inquiry,  Shri  Patil  (A-116),  SI   of   the\n      Shrivardhan Police Station, had asked  Salim  (A-134)  why  the  money\n      promised to them had not been paid, as regards  the  earlier  landing.\n      Uttam Potdar (A-30) had told him that he had given the said  money  to\n      Ramesh Mali Hawaldar.  SI  Patil  (A-116)  had  seemed  very  annoyed.\n      Mechanic Chacha (A-136) had then offered a sum  of  Rs.  10  lakhs  to\n      Hawaldar Ramesh Dattatray Mali  (A-101)  and  Hawaldar  Ashok  Narayan\n      Muneshwar (A-70), who were counting the silver bricks  that  had  been\n      loaded into the truck. There were 175 bricks in one truck, and in  the\n      other, there were about 100 bricks and also  some  boxes.  Upon  being\n      asked by the Hawaldar to reveal the contents of  the  boxes,  Mechanic\n      Chacha (A-136) had said that the boxes contained watches and  that  as\n      there was no cash, Mechanic Chacha (A-136) had taken out  five  silver\n      bricks  from  the  first  truck  and  had  given  them  to  Pashilkar,\n      policeman.

The\n      present appellants (A-70 and A-99) may be correct in  contending  that\n      simply because these witnesses had not seen the  appellants  in  their\n      village, the same cannot be taken to mean that the appellants had  not\n      been on patrolling duty.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_507\">      Deposition of Pramod Mudbhatkal (PW-681):\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_508\">      337.

The entry in the log  book  of  the  police  jeep  has\n      revealed that the same had been driven by the  appellant  (A-99),  and\n      this has not been disputed by the appellant (A-99). Hence, it is clear\n      that appellant (A-99) had been driving the said police jeep  when  the\n      party was headed by Vijay Krishnaji Patil (A-116). Furthermore, it has\n      been held that the confessions of the co-accused and  of  Dilip  Bhiku\n      Pansare (PW-97) clearly reveal the involvement of  the  appellants  in\n      the landing episode.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_510\">            It has also been  held  that  the  appellants  had  infact  been\n      members of the police party headed by their superior  Vijay  Krishnaji\n      Patil (A-116), and that though the appellants cannot  be  held  to  be\n      responsible  for  taking  the   decision   to   permit   the   further\n      transportation of said goods, however, taking into  account  the  fact\n      that they had not reported Vijay Krishnaji Patil’s  (A-116)  behaviour\n      to higher officials, and further, the recovery of a  large  amount  of\n      money from them, clearly reveals that  they  had  also  connived  with\n      Vijay Krishnaji Patil (A-116) to commit the said acts. Thus, they  are\n      liable under <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_165\">section 3(3)</a> TADA.

This appeal has been preferred against the respondents  only  on\n      the limited issue that the respondents  have  been  acquitted  by  the\n      Special Judge of the Designated Court under the TADA for the charge of\n      conspiracy.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_515\">      341.  Shri Mukul Gupta,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the\n      appellant-State has  submitted  that  these  respondents  were  police\n      constables who had been posted at the relevant time at the Shrivardhan\n      Police Station. They had intercepted the contraband (arms,  ammunition\n      and explosives etc.) at Gondghar  Phata.  They  had  checked  the  two\n      trucks carrying the said  contraband  for  about  15  and  10  minutes\n      respectively, and that despite the fact that the arms had been  packed\n      differently as compared to the silver, they had omitted to inspect the\n      said goods properly. Moreover, the fact that that they had  asked  for\n      enhancement of  the amount of bribe to be paid to the police for  each\n      landing, indicates that  they  were  aware  of  the  contents  of  the\n      contraband (arms, ammunition and explosives) as well, which gave  them\n      this bargaining power. Furthermore, the Customs Inspector had issued a\n      warning to all authorities, stating that he had  definite  information\n      that arms and ammunition would be brought in by sea,  owing  to  which\n      they should remain alert and ensure proper checking.  Therefore,  they\n      ought to have been convicted for the charge of conspiracy as well.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_516\">      342.  On the contrary, Shri P.K. Dey, learned  counsel  appearing  for\n      the respondents, has submitted that since  the  respondents  had  been\n      subordinate to the actual recipients of the  bribes,  which  had  been\n      taken  to facilitate the landing of the  contraband,  they  themselves\n      had been  unaware of the fact that arms and ammunition could have been\n      brought into the country once the vehicles had been checked.  They may\n      have been negligent in the performance of  their  duties,  but  by  no\n      stretch of the  imagination,  can  it  be  held  that  they  had  also\n      conspired  in  the  execution  of  the  transaction.  They  have  been\n      convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 3(3)</a>  TADA and their appeals have  been  heard\n      alongwith this appeal. Hence, no further  consideration  is  required,\n      particularly keeping in mind the parameters that have been  laid  down\n      by  this  court  for  interference  against  an  order  of  acquittal.\n      Therefore, this appeal is liable to be dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_517\">      343.  We have considered the rival submissions made by learned counsel\n      for the parties and perused the record.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_518\">      344.  After appreciating the  entire  evidence,  the  learned  Special\n      Judge reached a conclusion that  though  these  respondents-constables\n      may have been negligent in  the  performance  of  their  duties,  they\n      cannot be held to be parties to the conspiracy.  The  learned  Special\n      Judge has taken a view that as their presence had been established  at\n      the place of interception, a case  under  <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_167\">Section  3(3)</a>  TADA  can  be\n      established as a result of the cumulative effect of the said evidence.\n      However, in view of the fact that there is nothing on record  to  show\n      their involvement in the conspiracy, or of them having  committed  any\n      overt acts in the  execution  of  such  conspiracy,  the  question  of\n      convicting them for conspiracy does not arise. As their  acts  do  not\n      transcend  beyond  their  presence  and  their   negligence   in   the\n      interception and checking of the vehicles, they are  entitled  to  the\n      benefit of doubt as far as  the  conspiracy  is  concerned.   All  the\n      constables  were  of  inferior  ranks,  and  were  acting  under   the\n      instructions of the officers who had been present at the spot. Despite\n      the fact that all the four respondents had been members of the  police\n      party,  and  were  hence  responsible   for   allowing   the   further\n      transportation of the smuggled  contraband  goods,  there  appears  to\n      exist some distinction between the cases of the said accused,  and  of\n      Vijay Krishnaji Patil (A-116), the head of the police  party,  without\n      whose consent and connivance  the  said  goods  could  not  have  been\n      permitted to be transported any further. Therefore, in  his  presence,\n      the respondents-constables cannot be held as  responsible  for  taking\n      the decision to permit the further transportation of the  said  goods.\n      Thus, they are liable only for the offences punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_168\">Section\n      3(3)</a> TADA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_519\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"34062092\" id=\"span_2\">345.  We are fully aware of our limitation to interfere with an  order\n      against acquittal. In exceptional cases  where  there  are  compelling\n      circumstances and the judgment under appeal is found to  be  perverse,\n      the appellate court can interfere with the  order  of  acquittal.  The\n      appellate court should bear in mind the presumption  of  innocence  of\n      the accused and further that the trial Court’s acquittal bolsters  the\n      presumption of his innocence.

He was\n      closely acquainted with the other co-accused and Yakoob Khan (AA), his\n      uncle, had come alongwith other co-accused Tiger Memon  and  Nisar  to\n      his father in the second week of February, 1993, and requested him  to\n      allow them to keep some goods for few months in the godown  at  Thane.\n      They were permitted by his father to store the goods.  They  had  gone\n      there but could not open the lock  of  the  godown.   Therefore,  they\n      called the appellant at midnight and subsequently came to his house in\n      a jeep and took him (A-85) with them.  He also met Javed Chikna, Anwar\n      Izaz and other co-accused on the way. He was directed by his uncle  to\n      keep watch for a tempo which was bringing certain  goods.   He  waited\n      for a while but the tempo did  not  arrive.  So  he  went  inside  the\n      factory and slept there.  Thereafter, Tiger Memon (AA) alongwith Nisar\n      came to the factory in the jeep of Tiger Memon (AA) and tried to  open\n      the lock. As they could not open the lock they had to break it with an\n      axe. However, subsequently they came to  know  that  it  was  not  the\n      correct godown. Thus, Tiger Memon called at his (A-85)  residence  and\n      asked the correct number of his factory. Subsequently,  they  went  to\n      the correct factory and opened the same.  They took  the  tempo  which\n      had the goods inside the factory and unloaded the same.  It  contained\n      80 packets in gunny bags each packet weighed  about  30/35  Kg.  Tiger\n      Memon paid him Rs.600/- out of which he had paid  Rs.200/-  to  Nisar.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_530\">      Then the appellant washed the jeep alongwith  Nisar  and  Suleman  and\n      left for Bombay.

They  had  put  the\n      material in a car and left it in the parking of Rahat Manzil.  On  the\n      next morning, when he reached  there, he could not  find  the  car  at\n      that place. Two-three days before 17.2.1993 Tiger Memon (AA)  and  his\n      companions transferred the remaining explosives from  the  factory  to\n      some other place.

He\n      is a nephew of Yakoob Yeda (AA), who had been  a  close  associate  of\n      Tiger Memon (AA) and had not only permitted  to  use  his  godown  for\n      storing the arms, ammunition and explosives but had  also  accompanied\n      them when such  goods  were  shifted  from  there.

He was neither the owner of\n      the godown nor did he have any control over it.   It  belongs  to  his\n      father who had  never  been  an  accused.   The  respondent  had  been\n      harassed merely being the nephew of Yakoob Yeda (AA) and he  had  been\n      convicted for other charges and, hence, no interference is called for.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_548\">      363.

In his statement, he gave  full\n      details of smuggling,  landing  and  his  participation  in  smuggling\n      activities even in February, 1993 with Tiger  Memon  (AA).  He  (A-28)\n      revealed that it was 3 a.m., when Mujib (A-131) came to  Mhasla  where\n      the witness was sleeping. Mujib (A-131) said that they have to  go  to\n      said shop.  On that very same night at about 3 O’clock, he (A-28)  and\n      the appellant (A-131) left for said  shop  by  Yellow  Mitsubishi  and\n      reached there at about 6 O’clock and from there they bought 1500 sacks\n      from one Gujarati.  From there on 10.3.1993 around 12-12.30 p.m., they\n      went to Visawa hotel.  After about one and  half  hours,  Tiger  Memon\n      (AA) alongwith Yeda Yakub came there.  Tiger Memon  (AA)  brought  the\n      appellant (A-131) with him to  a  hotel  on  Mahad  Road.   One  white\n      Mitsubishi was parked there.  Tiger Memon said that many  people  were\n      present there, so goods could not be shifted in  another  vehicle  and\n      thus, he asked them to go to Mahsla.  In Mhasla  after  unloading  the\n      goods from white  Mitsubishi,  the  rolls  of  sacks  and  goods  were\n      uploaded half-half in both the vehicles.

Statement of Usman Jan Khan (PW.2) – Approver – who  was  a  co-\n      accused in the instant case.   His confessional statement was recorded\n      in which he did not name the appellant (A-131) and did not involve the\n      appellant in any overt act.  However, he turned as an  approver and he\n      was examined as PW.2 wherein he deposed that  he  knew  the  notorious\n      persons like Nasir Dakhla (A-64), Manoj Kumar @ Munna  Bhavarlal Gupta\n      as Munna (A-24), Riyaz  Abu  Bakar  Khatri,  Mujib  Sharif  Parkar  as\n      Dadabhai’s son (A-131) etc. He identified the appellant (A-131) in the\n      court.  While giving the details of landing at  Shekhadi,  he  deposed\n      that the witness participated in the landing  and  it  took  place  at\n      about 11 p.m., one boat came to the  coast  and  contacted  the  party\n      waiting for smuggled goods.  Tiger Memon (AA) alongwith witness and 5-\n      6 persons, namely, Yeda Yakub, Javed, Anwar, Shahid, Munna sat in  the\n      boat and went towards high sea for half an hour. The boat reached near\n      the speed boat.  Tiger Memon (AA) went over  to  the  speed  boat  and\n      after five minutes he passed over seven bags of military  colour  from\n      the speed boat to them and came back to the boat.   Then they left for\n      the coast with the seven bags and on reaching the coast,  Tiger  Memon\n      (AA) went to a hut on the coast with the  seven  bags.   In  the  hut,\n      Dadabhai (A-17), Dawood Taklya (A-14) and Dadabhai’s  son (A-131) were\n      present. Tiger Memon opened the seven bags  with  the  help  of  these\n      persons.  The bags were  containing  AK-56  rifles,  handgranades  and\n      pistols.   The witness was given a pistol. Tiger Memon (AA) told  them\n      that within a short time goods like  arms  and  Kala  Sabun  would  be\n      brought from the sea.  Tiger  Memon  instructed  them  to  attack  any\n      person who was an outsider and comes towards them.  The goods came  in\n      boats. Villagers unloaded the goods from the boat and  reloaded  in  a\n      truck which was standing there.  The villagers were persons of  Dawood\n      Taklya (A-14) and  Dadabhai  Parkar  (A-17).   After  the  goods  were\n      unloaded and reloaded in the truck,  the  villagers  left  the  place.\n      Then they proceeded towards Wangni Tower and reached  there  in  about\n      one and half hours.  It was located in a lonely  and  deserted  place.\n      Tiger Memon got the goods unloaded from the truck and goods were  kept\n      in a room in Wangni Tower.  On the instruction of  Tiger  Memon  (AA),\n      the  packages  were  opened  and  seen  to   contain   AK-56   rifles,\n      handgranades, pistols,  cartridges,  magazines  of  AK-56  rifles  and\n      wires.  The witness (PW.2) enquired from Javed  about  the  wires  and\n      Kala Sabun.  Tiger  Memon  (AA)  told  him  that  Kala  Sabun  was  an\n      explosive and the wires were detonators.  Tiger then  instructed  them\n      to put the rifles and other items in the cavities of the jeeps and  in\n      the tempo.  The bags in which these items were brought were  burnt  by\n      Dawood Taklya (A-14), Dadabhai Parkar (A-17) and his  son  (A-131)  in\n      the backyard on the instructions of Tiger  Memon  (AA).

However, he did not identify any of the accused.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_562\">      377.

However,  Sayyed  Abdul  Rehman\n      Kamruddin Sayed (A-28) did not disclose the full name of  accused  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_565\">      131), rather referred to as Muzib.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_566\">      379.  From the aforesaid evidence, it is evident that the appellant (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_567\">      131) was the son of Dadabhai (A-17) who was a close associate of Tiger\n      Memon (AA) and indulged in smuggling activities and  participated  and\n      facilitated in the landing  and  transportation  of  contraband.   The\n      appellant (A-131) had participated in purchasing  the  gunny  bags  as\n      well as in transportation and had been fully  aware  of  the  contents\n      therein as is evident  from  the  deposition  of  Usman  (PW.2).   The\n      appellant (A-131) knew that the gunny  bags  contained  AK-56  rifles,\n      handgranades, arms etc. The appellant (A-131) purchased the gunny bags\n      in the fake name of non-existing person twice.  If  all  the  evidence\n      against him is read conjontly, the inference may  be  that  the  gunny\n      bags were used to carry the arms which  were  smuggled  to  India  and\n      transported to Bombay.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_568\">      380.

Ms. Farhana Shah, learned counsel appearing for  the  respondent\n      (A-131) has submitted that the basic evidence against  the  respondent\n      (A-131) was the evidence of Usman (PW.2) who had been an  accused  and\n      turned to be an approver and he did not refer to  the  respondent  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_573\">      131) in his confessional statement. More so, his evidence has not been\n      corroborated by any other person. He had been  involved  in  the  case\n      merely being the son of a landing agent  of  Tiger  Memon  (AA).   The\n      evidentiary value of the approver requires  corroboration.

There was nothing  to  show  that  he  committed  any  act\n      furthering the object of conspiracy, beyond  rendering  assistance  to\n      the operation organized by his father alongwith  other  partners.  The\n      same made it extremely difficult to attribute knowledge of  object  of\n      conspiracy to A-131. Therefore, he was  given  the  benefit  of  doubt\n      regarding the said charge and  was  held  not  guilty  of  conspiracy.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_577\">      386.  In view of the above, as the identity of   accused  (A-131)  had\n      not been fully disclosed by some of the accused and witnesses and even\n      Usman (PW.2) who had involved  respondent (A-131) in  many  activities\n      did not mention his name in the confessional statement given  by  him.\n      He (PW.2) further clarified in cross examination  that  he  could  not\n      give any reason for not mentioning the name of the accused (A-131)  in\n      his confessional statement.

In the statement made under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_198\">Section  313</a>  of  Code  of  Criminal\n      Procedure, 1973  (hereinafter  referred  to  as  the  ‘<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_199\">Cr.P.C</a>.’),  the\n      appellant  (A-90)  has  completely  denied  the   recording   of   his\n      confessional  statement  by  Chaturvedula   Shstri   (PW-186),   while\n      answering the questions put to him.  The appellant (A-90)  refused  to\n      acknowledge most of the incriminating material that was pointed out to\n      him by the Designated Court.  The Designated Court considered the same\n      in great detail, appreciating it alongwith  the  cross-examination  of\n      Chaturvedula Shstri (PW-186).  The appellant (A-90) has further stated\n      under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_200\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. that  in  his  confessional  statement,  his\n      signatures were forcibly obtained on  1.5.1993,  and  subsequently  on\n      3.5.1993 at a few places, when a sentence was inserted in  the  margin\n      of page 3.

However, after considering everything  on  record,  the  learned\n      Designated Court came to the conclusion that there was no manipulation\n      in his confessional statement, and that the same  had  voluntary  been\n      made by appellant (A-90).  His explanation was that,  after  recording\n      his confessional statement, Chaturvedula Shstri (PW-186) had  sent  it\n      to the CJM, who had not  accepted  the  same,  and  had  returned  it.\n      Therefore, there was manipulation.   Such an averment was rejected  by\n      the Designated Court,  pointing  out  that  the  same  had  been  sent\n      directly by Chaturvedula Shstri  (PW-186)  to  the  Designated  Court,\n      Pune, which had received it directly.  Therefore, the question of  any\n      kind of manipulation did not arise.  Thus, the confessional  statement\n      cannot be termed as a manufactured document, as has  been  claimed  by\n      appellant (A-90).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_604\">      405.

The  appellant\n      accepted a huge amount of money as his share of illegal  gratification\n      from co-accused  R.K.

Mr. Sushil Kumar,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the\n      appellant (A-102), has submitted that the appellant (A-102)  has  been\n      acquitted of the first charge of general conspiracy, and a finding  of\n      fact has been recorded by the Designated  Court,  that  there  was  no\n      evidence on record to show that the appellant had accepted  any  bribe\n      from  any  of  the  smugglers  or  their  landing  agents  etc.    The\n      confessional statement of the  appellant  has  been  rejected  by  the\n      Designated Court on the ground that it was recorded by  the  Inspector\n      of Police, and such person  has  not  been  accepted  as  a  competent\n      authority under <a href=\"/doc/1972990/\" id=\"a_204\">Section 15</a> TADA, to record such statement.  Therefore,\n      such a confession cannot be  taken  into  consideration.    Eight  co-\n      accused in their confessional  statements  have  named  the  appellant\n      stating that the landing agents of the smugglers had been in   contact\n      with him and that they had been paying to him, amounts as  were  fixed\n      per landing.  However, the statements of  three co-accused i.e.  Uttam\n      Shantaram Potdar (A-30),  Mohmed Salim Mira  Moiddin  Shaikh  @  Salim\n      Kutta (A-134) and Mohmed Kasam  Lajpuria  @  Mechanic  Chacha  (A-136)\n      were recorded subsequent to the date  of  amendment  dated  22.5.1993.\n      Therefore, the confessional statements of five other co-accused, which\n      were recorded prior to the date  of  the  said  amendment,  cannot  be\n      relied upon.  The contents  of  the  confessional  statements  of  the\n      aforementioned three co-accused do not inspire confidence  and  cannot\n      be relied upon. The appellant (A-102) has wrongly been convicted under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_205\">Section 3(3)</a>  TADA and awarded a sentence of 9 years alongwith a  fine\n      of Rs.3 lakhs.  The appellant has already  served  about  7  years  of\n      imprisonment,  and  has  also  deposited  the  fine.  Moreover,  other\n      officers of the Customs Department were also convicted in  this  case,\n      particularly, Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A-82), Mohmed  Sultan  Sayyed  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_610\">      90), Somnath  Kakaram  Thapa  (A-112)  (dead)  and  Sudhanwa  Sadashiv\n      Talwadekar (A-113), and among them,   Somnath  Kakaram  Thapa  (A-112)\n      (dead) who was a superior officers to the appellant (A-102), and  also\n      others who were his subordinates, have been awarded a lesser sentence.\n       A sentence of 8 years was awarded to Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A-82)  and\n      of seven years to Mohmed Sultan Sayyed  (A-90).  Hence,  his  sentence\n      should be reduced to the period already undergone.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_611\">      410.  Shri Mukul Gupta,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the\n      respondent, has vehemently opposed  the  appeal  contending  that  the\n      confessional statements of all the co-accused, though  recorded  prior\n      to the date of amendment, must  be  relied  upon.   The  Collector  of\n      Customs Shiv Kumar Bhardwaj (PW-470) informed  the  appellant  (A-102)\n      over the telephone on 25.1.1993 that he (PW-470) had received definite\n      information through Intelligence that arms  and  ammunition  would  be\n      smuggled into India alongwith silver and gold and that landings of the\n      same would take place  within  the  territorial  jurisdiction  of  the\n      appellant (A-102).  Hence, he must take all necessary precautions  and\n      seize both, the weapons as well as the  contraband  silver  and  gold.\n      Undoubtedly, the appellant (A-102) regularly  informed  the  Collector\n      about the progress made by him in this regard, but did  not  take  any\n      actual effective measures, instead, he spent his time  bargaining  and\n      taking bribes from  the  smugglers,  to  facilitate  the  landing  and\n      transportation of the said goods. Hence, no leniency must be shown  to\n      him.  The appeal is liable to be dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_612\">      411.  We have considered the rival submissions made by learned counsel\n      for the parties and perused the record.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_613\">      412.  The confessional statement made by  the  appellant  has  rightly\n      been rejected by the Designated Court, and we do  not  wish  to  spend\n      further time on this issue.  This, being the first appeal, it  becomes\n      necessary for  us  to  re-appreciate  the  evidence  on  record  while\n      considering the same.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_614\">      413.

After considering the entire evidence  on  record,  the  learned\n      Special Judge came to the conclusion as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_345\">           ?“265) Without making any unnecessary dilation  about  the  self-\n           eloquent evidence about which the relevant  excerpts  are  cited\n           earlier it can be safely said that considering the act committed\n           by these 4 accused as reflected from same i.e. participation  of\n           A-102 &amp; 90  in  Persian  Darbar  meeting  and  negotiating  with\n           smugglers about the bribe amount to be paid and granting them  a\n           charter to smuggle the contraband articles or in fact any thing,\n           the act of  A-82  inspite  of  being  present  on  the  spot  of\n           interception of goods by police, instead  of  seizing  the  same\n           allowing  the  same  to  be  transported  further  and  in  most\n           clandestine manner piloting the convoy carrying  the  contraband\n           goods on  its  way  to  destination  uptil  a  particular  spot,\n           advising the policemen in clandestine manner etc., and of  A-II3\n           though not being directly connected with said landing readily  &amp;\n           willingly accepting his share of booty  from  the  bribe  amount\n           received for the said landing and thereby denoting  his  implied\n           connivance for the said operation seized earlier;  not  revealed\n           otherwise in view of himself being not directly  involvement  in\n           commission of act and considering the further acts committed byA-\n           90, 82 and 113 regarding Shekadi landing and  so  also  to  some\n           extent by--A-l02 clearly reveals themselves having committed the\n           offence<a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_206\"> u/s. 3(3)</a> of TADA  for  which  each  of  them  has  been\n           charged with at this trial.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_346\">           266) However, the careful consideration  of  said  evidence  and\n           even after taking into consideration the fact that A-l02 and  A-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_636\">           90  had  participated  in  Persian  Darbar  meeting;  still  the\n           evidence having fall short of themselves  having  connived  with\n           the conspirators in this case for commission of said act for the\n           purposes of conspiracy, it will be difficult to hold them or  an\n           of ?them liable for offence of conspiracy for which each of  them\n           has  been  charged  with  on  the  basis  of  evidence  surfaced\n           regarding Dighi  landing  episode  and  so  also  about  Shekadi\n           landing episode about which the discussion is made later on.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_637\">           267) Truly speaking receipt of bribe  amount  for  allowing  the\n           said operation considered from proper angle also  connotes  that\n           the act committed by the A-102, 90, 113 &amp; 82 being primarily for\n           receipt of  bribe  amount  by  misusing/abusing  their  official\n           position would definitely fallout of sphere  of  the  conspiracy\n           for which the relevant operation was organized and  effected  by\n           other co-accused.  The same is obvious  as  conspirators  always\n           join the conspiracy or become members of conspiracy due to being\n           interested in either furthering  the  object  of  conspiracy  or\n           achieving the object of conspiracy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_638\">           The payment of the money for commission of act which may have  a\n           semblance of furthering object of conspiracy will still not make\n           the concerned liable for offence  of  conspiracy.  The  same  is\n           apparent as the act committed by them would be for the  purposes\n           of receiving the said payment and not mainly for furthering  the\n           object of conspiracy. It is true that their such acts  as  ruled\n           earlier would amount to commission of offence of an abetment  or\n           assistance  et  for  commission  of  terrorist  act   by   other\n           conspirators and they could be held  liable  for  the  same  but\n           still they cannot be said to be involved in the  conspiracy.  In\n           view of the aforesaid, none of the A-102, 90, 113 &amp;  82  can  be\n           said to be guilty for commission of offences of  conspiracy  for\n           which the charge at head 1st ly is framed against them  or  even\n           otherwise  for  any  smaller  conspiracy.  However,  by  way  of\n           abundant caution it will be necessary to record  that  aforesaid\n           observations is limited to above stated 4 accused  from  Customs\n           dept., and the same is not  in  relation  to  A-102  i.e.  Addl.\n           Collector of Customs whose case clearly appears to be  different\n           i.e. his connection with Tiger Memon being spelt  from  evidence\n           revealed during Shekadi landing, there being hardly any evidence\n           of himself having received….”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_639\">      427.

Bhal\n      (PW.191). In his confessional statement, he has admitted that  he  had\n      gone several times to the house of Rahim Laundriwala alongwith Jaywant\n      Keshav Gurav (A-82) and that he was closely associated with  Dawood  @\n      Dawood  Taklya  Mohammed  Phanse  @  Phanasmiyan  (A-14)  and   Bashir\n      Mandlekar, who were landing agents. He (A-113) would seek  information\n      about  smuggling  and  also  about  the  collecting   of   money   for\n      facilitating the landing and  transportation  of  smuggled  contraband\n      silver and gold. He (A-113) had gone to the house of Rahim Laundriwala\n      alongwith Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A-82), Customs Inspector and had taken\n      an amount of Rs.1,60,000/- from him which he (A-113)  had  distributed\n      to others, and had kept a sum of  Rs.72,000/- for  himself.

In fact, in light of the fact\n      that he had received directions from his superior officers, to  be  on\n      guard, as it was likely that arms and  ammunition  would  be  smuggled\n      alongwith silver and gold, he had gone to Shekhadi.  It  was  dark  at\n      about 10.30 - 11.00 p.m., and when the appellant (A-113)  reached  the\n      said place, with Jaywant Keshav Gurav (A-82), Customs Inspector. Here,\n      he found  Rahim  Laundriwala  and  Dawood  Taklya  Mohammed  Phanse  @\n      Phanasmiyan (A-14),  who introduced him to  Tiger  Memon  (AA).  Tiger\n      Memon asked the appellant (A-113) whether he  was  the  Superintendent\n      Inspector, and when the appellant (A-113) answered in the affirmative,\n       Tiger Memon told him (A-113) that he had been trying to  contact  the\n      appellant for 2-3 days, however he had failed in his  attempts  to  do\n      so. The appellant (A-113)  also  asked  Tiger  Memon  whether  he  was\n      smuggling weapons etc. To the said question, Tiger Memon (AA)  replied\n      that he would never indulge in such activities.  The appellant (A-113)\n      has further confessed that even for the said landing,  Jaywant  Keshav\n      Gurav (A-82), Customs Inspector, had received a sum of  Rs.1,60,000/-,\n      which had been distributed, and the appellant in turn, had received  a\n      sum of Rs.54,000/- as his share.  He has further stated  that  he  had\n      spent all the money that he had received from the smugglers from  time\n      to time.

He (A-82) had conversations with Tiger Memon  (AA)\n      and had further allowed Uttam Potdar (A-30) to drive  a  customs  car.\n      However, as he (A-82) was an officer of a lower rank  in  the  Customs\n      Department, it was his superior officers who were actually involved in\n      the conspiracy. His involvement was  to  the  extent  of  the  offence\n      punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_216\">Section 3(3)</a> TADA, which  includes  conspiracy  to  a\n      certain extent, as well as of offences  punishable  under  the  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_217\">Indian\n      Penal Code</a>; the <a href=\"/doc/176528/\" id=\"a_218\">Explosives Act</a>; the <a href=\"/doc/1568384/\" id=\"a_219\">Explosives Substances Act</a>; and the\n      <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_220\">Arms Act</a> etc.  Thus,  despite  the  fact  that  he  himself  had  been\n      involved in abetting the landing and transportation of contraband,  he\n      could not be held guilty of the larger  conspiracy.  The  appeal  with\n      respect to Jayawant Gauruv (A-82) was hence, dismissed.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_677\">      II.   Mohd.

Furthermore,  it  was  also  submitted  that   the   said\n      confessional statement was recorded strictly in  accordance  with  the\n      law, and therefore  the  same  must  be  relied  upon.

He (A-42) used  to\n      smuggle for Tiger Memon (AA).  He had worked as a welder in a  defence\n      workshop in Kuwait during 1976-1987.

He further admitted that he\n      was  given  Rs.5,000/-  by  Dawood  Taklya  (A-14)  as  a  reward  for\n      participating  in  the  landing.   Tiger  Memon  (AA)  had  threatened\n      everybody that in the event that anyone disclosed  details  about  the\n      said landing to any other person, his family would be eliminated.

Having\n      regard to the fact that Dawood  @ Dawood Taklya (A-14) had chosen  the\n      appellant for the purpose of keeping 2 revolvers with him and the fact\n      that the appellant (A-42)  had readily kept the same, reveals that  he\n      was a man in which the prime accused had confidence  with  respect  to\n      the conspiracy. However, since he  had  committed  the  aforementioned\n      relevant acts much prior to the date of the bomb blasts  and  had  not\n      participated in any meetings, nor was he connected with  the  same  in\n      any manner, and the fact that the acts were committed by him at a time\n      when even the targets of the Bomb blasts had not been fixed, he  could\n      not be held guilty for the offence of  larger  conspiracy  i.e.  first\n      charge.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_728\">      485.

The learned Special Judge erred in recording the  findings  that\n      the appellants had participated in the training for handling  of  arms\n      at Sandheri on 8th January, 1993.   In  view  of  the  fact  that  the\n      appellants  have  not  participated  in  acquiring  any  knowledge  in\n      handling of arms is meaningless and, therefore, their participation in\n      the training cannot be relied upon.   In  view  of  specific  findings\n      recorded by the learned Designated Court  that the appellants were not\n      even known the contents of the contraband, their conviction under  any\n      provision of TADA is not sustainable.

He\n      alongwith other police officials reached Sandheri  at  2.00  p.m.  and\n      found that  the  incident  had  occurred  at  Chinchecha  Mal  in  the\n      hillocks of Sandheri.  Next day, on the instructions of Shri T.S. Bhal\n      he reached Sandheri Village at about 6.00 a.m.  Three police officials\n      and 20 constables had already reached the said  place.   He  inspected\n      the said spot and drew up the panchanama. He   recovered  three  empty\n      cartridges of a rifle bearing some marking on it, six lead pieces, the\n      broken branches of the tree, the targets prepared out of a  cardboard,\n      the stones bearing the  marks  of  bullets  and  these  articles  were\n      wrapped in a paper.  The packet  was  tied   with  sutli  and  it  was\n      sealed.  The panchnama was read over to  the  co-panchas  and  it  was\n      signed by him and other co-panchas.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_755\">            He had further deposed that on  30.3.1993  while  recording  the\n      statement of some persons, the residents of Sandheri he got  the  clue\n      about the involvement of one Hamid and  Shahjahan,  the  residents  of\n      Sandheri in the incident of training at Sandheri hillocks on 8.3.1993.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_756\">            He deposed that in spite of his best efforts he could not  trace\n      out the accused  on  31.3.1993.   However,  on  1.4.1994  he  got  the\n      information that Hamid, Shahjahan, Issaq Hajwane and  Sikkandar  Issaq\n      Hajwane  had taken shelter in the Sandheri forest.  He  reached  there\n      alongwith other police officials and found them and  brought  them  to\n      Goregaon Police Station for inquiry.  After being satisfied that  they\n      were accused involved in C.R. No.6/93, they  were  arrested  at  10.15\n      a.m.\n            On the same day,  at  about  10.30  a.m.  Issaq  Hajwane  (A-79)\n      expressed  his  desire  to  make  voluntary  statement.  The   witness\n      immediately called two panch witnesses for drawing the  panchnama.  He\n      deposed that one panch witness was Ashok Vichare (PW-104), and he  did\n      not remember the name of the other panch witness.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_757\">      Deposition of  Chandrakant Sambhaji Pawaskar (PW-609)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_758\">      502.

The said empty cartridges sent to Chemical Analyst  for\n      examination  on  17.4.1993  were  bearing  marking  “661/71”  and  the\n      panchnama shown to him does not reveal  any  empty  cartridge  bearing\n      marking “661/71” being seized under the same panchnama.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_762\">      Deposition of Mahadeo Yeshwant Jadav (PW-103)\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_763\">      503.  He is an agriculturist.  He was called on 29th  March,  1993  to\n      act as a panch witness by the police from Goregaon Police Station.  He\n      deposed that he alongwith Shri Patil reached Chinchecha Mal  at  about\n      9.00 a.m. Some 4-5 police officials were already present at the place.\n        The police asked the panch witnesses  to  collect  broken  branches,\n      pieces of cardboard, three empty  cartridges,   six  lead  pieces  and\n      pieces of stones  lying on the ground and  the police took  charge  of\n      the said articles. The police effected the  writings  about  the  said\n      things and signatures of the panch  witnesses  were  obtained  on  the\n      writings. The said writings were read  over  to  them  by  the  police\n      before their signatures.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_764\">      504.    After appreciating the entire evidence, the learned Designated\n      Court recorded the finding that the appellant (A-79) could not furnish\n      any explanation that he had no knowledge of said  contraband  material\n      for some other reason, and his possession of such articles for such  a\n      long period considered along with his participation  in  the  training\n      programme leads to no other conclusion than  himself  being  party  to\n      conspiracy to commit terrorist act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_765\">            However,  having regard to  fact  that  there  exists  no  other\n      evidence of commission of any act by the appellant (A-79) and there is\n      no evidence of him having been to Bombay  or  having  participated  in\n      conspiratorial  meetings,  it  would  be  difficult  to  accept   that\n      knowledge of commission of  serial  bombs  blasts  in  Bombay  can  be\n      attributed to him. Since there is a paucity of evidence to  show  that\n      the appellant (A-79) had any knowledge regarding the places  at  which\n      the explosions were committed in Bombay, he cannot be held liable  for\n      the offence of larger conspiracy for which the charge at head  firstly\n      is framed against him. However,  considering  the  acts  and  offences\n      committed by him and particularly the retaining of such  a  contraband\n      material and disposing the same definitely establishes himself being a\n      party to conspiracy to commit terrorist act punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_266\">Section\n      3(3)</a>  TADA.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_766\">      505.

From the evidence referred to hereinabove, it  is  evident  that\n      Harishchandra Keshav Pawar  (PW-105)  named  three  persons  from  his\n      village participating in the arms training at  Sandheri  hillocks  and\n      one of them had been Issaq Mohmed Hajwani (A-79).  Rajaram  Ramchandra\n      Kadam (PW-106) named all the three appellants to be members consisting\n      of 8-10 persons participating in the training of arms  and  ammunition\n      in Sandheri hillocks on 8.3.1993  and  he  identified  all  the  three\n      appellants alongwith others  in  the  court.   The  other  co-accused,\n      particularly, Abdul Gani Ismail Turk (A-11), Dawood  @  Dawood  Taklya\n      Mohammed Phanse @ Phanasmiyan (A-14) and Sharif Abdul Gafoor Parkar  @\n      Dadabhai (A-17), in their confessional statements had also  named  all\n      the three appellants as participants in the arms training on  8.3.1993\n      at Sandheri  hillocks.  The  evidence  of  the  aforesaid  persons  is\n      trustworthy as we do not see any reason to discard the same  at  least\n      to the extent of participation  of  these  three  appellants  in  arms\n      training on 8.3.1993 at Sandheri hillocks.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_768\">           In view of the above, the appeal is dismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_769\">      Criminal Appeal No. 396 of 2011\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_770\">      507.

Shri Mukul Gupta,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the\n      appellant has submitted  that  the  said  respondents  had  been  very\n      closely associated with terrorist activities and had  participated  in\n      the training at Sandheri with Tiger Memon (AA).  Therefore, they ought\n      to have been convicted for the charge of conspiracy also.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_772\">      509.   On  the  contrary,  Shri  Sushil  Karanjekar,  learned  counsel\n      appearing for the respondents (A-106 and A-111) has vehemently opposed\n      the appeal, contending  that  they  were  convicted  and  have  served\n      substantial part thereof.  The respondents (A-106 and A-111)  did  not\n      participate in the training at Sandheri, and at the most,  they  could\n      be held to be silent spectators of the training and  therefore,  could\n      not be involved in the offence. Thus,  the  appeal  is  liable  to  be\n      dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_773\">      510.  None of the said respondents (A-106  and  A-111)  has  made  any\n      confession.  The evidence  against  them  regarding  the  training  at\n      Sandheri is only by Rajaram Kadam (PW-106), who  had  deposed  in  the\n      court that on 8.3.1993, some people were being trained in handling  of\n      arms at Chinchecha Mal in the morning at about 10 a.m.  As  there  was\n      continuous firing he went to the said hillock in  order  to  find  out\n      what was happening.  There he saw two persons armed with guns standing\n      at the said place and 5-6 persons were sitting at Chinchecha Mal.   He\n      also saw a cardboard target fixed nearby the hillock.  One person with\n      the beard from the persons who were sitting there got up and asked him\n      to leave the hillock otherwise he would  be  shot  by  the  gun.   The\n      witness (PW-106)  was  frightened  and  immediately  returned  to  his\n      village. He did not know the person who  had  threatened  him  or  the\n      other persons who were having the arms.  About 4 to 5 persons from his\n      village were amongst the persons who were sitting at the said place at\n      that time including these  two  respondents  (A-106  and  A-111).   He\n      identified both the respondents (A-106 and  A-111)  in  court  as  the\n      persons sitting at Chinchecha Mal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_774\">      511.  The learned Designated Court  after  appreciating  the  evidence\n      came to the conclusion that there was sufficient evidence  to  convict\n      the respondents (A-106 and A-111) under <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_267\">Section  3(3)</a>  TADA,  as  they\n      also facilitated Tiger Memon (AA) in other aspects, but merely sitting\n      at the hillock, did not mean that they participated  in  the  training\n      and therefore, it could not be the basis of assuming  that  they  were\n      party to the training programme.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_775\">      512.  The parameters laid down  by  this  court  in  entertaining  the\n      appeal against the order of acquittal have to be applied.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_776\">      513.  In view of the above, we do not see any cogent  reason  to  take\n      the view contrary to the view taken  by  the  learned  Special  Judge,\n      considering the parameters laid down by this  court  for  entertaining\n      the appeal against the order of acquittal.

Shri Mukul Gupta,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the\n      appellant  has  submitted  that  there   was   enough   evidence   and\n      particularly, the confessional statement made by Sharif  Abdul  Gafoor\n      Parkar @ Dadabhai (A-17), and the depositions of Mahadeo Jaswant Jadav\n      (PW-103), Ashok  Vichare  (PW-104),  Harish  Chandra  Pawar  (PW-105),\n      Rajaram Kadam  (PW-106),  and  Namdev  Pundlik  Mahajan  (PW-587),  to\n      convict the respondent for the first charge of conspiracy.  Thus,  the\n      court below committed an error in acquitting the respondent  from  the\n      said charge,  and  thus  on  that  count,  the  respondent  should  be\n      convicted.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_780\">      516.

Thus, the appeal is liable  to  be\n      dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_781\">      517.  The Designated Court after appreciating the entire evidence came\n      to the following conclusion:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_406\">                 “However,  case  regarding  A-79  clearly  appears  to  be\n           different. There exists an evidence denoting that in  consequent\n           to information given by A-79, 13 handgrenades and  empties  were\n           recovered/seized by police during the period  from  1.4.1993  to\n           3.4.1993 from the sea  coast  at  Gandharwadi.  The  said  facet\n           considered on the backdrop that  training  programme  had  taken\n           place  on  8th  of  March,  1993  or  thereabout  leads  to  the\n           conclusion of A-79 having the knowledge  of  such  a  contraband\n           article in the month of April 1993 and the same being  recovered\n           from  the  place  shown  by  him.  Now  considering  in   proper\n           perspective the information furnished by A-79 his  knowledge  of\n           such material lying at the said place and the reason because  of\n           which he was having the same i.e. his authorship in dumping  the\n           material at the said  place.   All  the  said  evidence  clearly\n           reveals that all the said material  must  have  been  with  A-79\n           after the training programme was complete and/or  at  least  the\n           said evidence and the ultimate act  committed  by  him   reveals\n           that himself having dominum and control over the  said  material\n           and hence consequently being in possession of same. Thus  having\n           regard to the said facets leads to no other conclusion that A-79\n           being also guilty for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1886064/\" id=\"a_268\">Section 6</a> of TADA,  offences\n           under <a href=\"/doc/1092263/\" id=\"a_269\">Sections 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/871582/\" id=\"a_270\">7</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_271\">Section 25</a>(1-A)(1-B)(a) of <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_272\">Arms\n           Act</a> and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_273\">Section 201</a> IPC.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_782\">                 In addition to same and having  regard  to  fact  that  no\n           explanation had come forward  from  A-79  that  he  was   having\n           knowledge of said contraband material for some other reason  and\n           his  possession  of  such  articles  for  such  a  long   period\n           considered  along  with  his  participation  in   the   training\n           programme leads to no other conclusion than himself being  party\n           to conspiracy to commit terrorist act. However, having regard to\n           fact that there exists no other evidence of  commission  of  any\n           act by A-79, himself being not a resident of Bombay, no evidence\n           of himself having been  to  Bombay  or  having  participated  in\n           conspiratorial meeting, it will  be  difficult  to  accept  that\n           knowledge of commission of serial bomb blasts in Bombay  can  be\n           attributed to him. Since there is a paucity of evidence to  show\n           that A-79 was having any knowledge regarding the places at which\n           the explosions were committed in Bombay he cannot be held liable\n           for the offence of larger conspiracy for which  charge  at  head\n           firstly is framed against him. However, considering the acts and\n           offences committed by him and particularly the retaining of such\n           a  contraband  material  and  disposing  the   same   definitely\n           establishes  himself  being  party  to  conspiracy   to   commit\n           terrorist act punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_274\">Section 3(3)</a> of TADA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_783\">           The court further held:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_407\">                  The  same  discloses  that  A-79  was  found  guilty  for\n           commission of offence of conspiracy  to  commit  terrorist  act,\n           punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_275\">Section 3(3)</a> of TADA  and  he  was  also  found\n           guilty on four other counts for  commission  of  offences  under\n           <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_276\">Sections 3(3)</a>  and <a href=\"/doc/1886064/\" id=\"a_277\">6</a> of TADA,  <a href=\"/doc/1092263/\" id=\"a_278\">Sections 3</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/871582/\" id=\"a_279\">7</a> read with  <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_280\">Section\n           25</a>(1-A)(1-B)(a) of <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_281\">Arms Act</a> and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_282\">Section 201</a> IPC.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_408\">                 Without unnecessarily reiterating every  aspect  connected\n           with decision arrived accordingly, in short it can be said  that\n           each of the said accused was found  guilty   accordingly  mainly\n           due to  acts  committed  by  him  in  connection  with  Sandheri\n           training Episode which has taken place on 8th of March, 1993  at\n           Borghat and Sandheri in which  prime  absconding  accused  Tiger\n           Memon had organised a training camp for imparting a training  of\n           handling arms, ammunition and handgrenades to the persons  taken\n           from Bombay and so also local persons from the area of Sandheri.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_409\">                 The  evidence  surfaced  and/or  reasoning  given  thereon\n           earlier also reveals that all the aforesaid accused persons were\n           local residents and were not from Bombay.

In view of the fact that after appreciating the entire  evidence\n      the learned Special Judge reached the  conclusion  that  the  case  of\n      respondent (A-79) was entirely different from  the  other  co-accused,\n      particularly those who had not participated in  the training of  arms.\n      It was further held that respondent (A-79) had knowledge of  the  said\n      contraband material being arms and ammunition and had been brought for\n      terrorist  activities  and  he  was  found  in   possession   of   the\n      handgrenades and empties; it was further found that  A-79  had  thrown\n      the same in the creek water to absolve himself of the offences. We are\n      of the view that the Special Judge was not justified in acquitting him\n      from the first charge of larger conspiracy merely on the  ground  that\n      he did not know about the places where the bombs had to be thrown  and\n      he was not the resident of Bombay  and  did  not  participate  in  the\n      conspiratorial meetings. The finding of fact recorded by  the  Special\n      Judge is also contradictory as the court held that he participated  in\n      the arms’  training  at  Sandheri.   However,  he  observed  that  the\n      evidence does not disclose that any of those accused had been  trained\n      in handling of handgrenades.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_786\">      520.

After the demolition of  the  Babri  Masjid,\n      Karimullah called the appellant (A-128) through Shaikh Mohmed Ethesham\n      Haji Gulam Rasool Shaikh (A-58), and met him (A-128) in  a  flat  near\n      Rajasthan Hotel, Bombay, in the last week of  January,  or  the  first\n      week of February, 1993.  At such time, several other accused were also\n      present in the flat.  He learnt later on, that the said flat  belonged\n      to Yeda Yaqub.  Karimullah assured the appellant (A-128) that he would\n      find some work for him  and  also  gave  him  Rs.500/-  for  household\n      expenditure.  After 2-3 days, when he  went  to  meet  Karimullah,  he\n      found large number of other co-accused sitting in the said  flat,  and\n      saw that they were getting ready to go  somewhere.   Akbar  asked  the\n      appellant (A-128) to go with them.   They  all  proceeded  in  a  blue\n      coloured commander Jeep.  While going with them,  he  also  saw  Tiger\n      Memon (AA) and other persons moving alongwith them  in  another  jeep.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_796\">      He was told by Shaikh Mohmed Ethesham Haji Gulam Rasool Shaikh  (A-58)\n      that the persons in the other jeep who were traveling with  them  were\n      Tiger Memon, Javed Chikna, Tahir Takalpa, Nazir,  Bashir  Khan,  Salim\n      Kurla, Rahat Ali and Mansoor Ahmad.  He was told by  Akbar  that  they\n      were going to Shrivardhan to collect  weapons  etc.,  which  had  been\n      ordered by Tiger Memon (AA) for the Bombay  blasts.  All  the  persons\n      including the appellant (A-128) and Tiger Memon (AA) reached  Shekahdi\n      at 8.00 p.m.  After reaching the Beach, Tiger Memon  removed  a  rifle\n      from a black bag and gave the same to  Javed  Chikna,  Karimullah  and\n      Nasir.  After sometime,  Tiger  Memon,  alongwith  a  few  co-accused,\n      particularly, Jawed  Chikna,  Yeda  Yaqub,  Dawood  Takalya  and  some\n      labourers went into the Sea in a trawler which was already been parked\n      there, and returned after 15-20 minutes with some goods.  They took 3-\n      4 rounds to the Sea and back, and brought sacks with  them  each  time\n      they returned.  Tiger Memon opened some sacks and  the  appellant  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_797\">      128) saw that they contained rifles, hand grenades  and  plastic  bags\n      containing a black coloured powder in them. Bullets  were  also  among\n      the said contraband, which were kept by Tiger Memon in his Maruti car.\n       After that they left the said place and travelled for about  an  hour\n      and reached a building which looked like a factory with a  big  tower.\n      After reaching there, the sacks were kept outside once  unloaded  from\n      the tempo.  Some packets containing rifles and plastic bags were  kept\n      in the cavities in the Commander jeeps.  At 5 a.m. they left the  said\n      tower and reached Mahad  from  where  they  left  for  Bombay  on  the\n      instructions of Tiger Memon (AA).  The appellant (A-128)  was  sitting\n      in the tempo alongwith Karimullah.  The  appellant  (A-128)  got  down\n      from the tempo upon the instructions of the other co-accused  and  the\n      tempo was taken to Mumbra and its contents were emptied there by  Yeda\n      Yakub.  He further said that after a few  days  Karimullah  asked  the\n      appellant (A-128) over the telephone whether he had a passport, and as\n      the answer provided by him was in  the  affirmative,  he  (A-128)  was\n      called alongwith his passport. When he went to  meet  Karimullah  with\n      his (A-128) passport, he found some of the other co-accused present in\n      Karimullah’s flat.  He (A-128) handed over his passport to  Karimullah\n      and asked why it was required, he (A-128) was then told  that  he  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_798\">      128) had to go to Dubai for weapons’ training.  The appellant  (A-128)\n      subsequently left for Dubai on 15.2.1993 on the ticket arranged by the\n      co-accused.  He went there alongwith  seven  other  co-accused.   They\n      went to Dubai by an  Air  India  flight  and  reached  there  at  6.00\n      o’clock in the evening.  They got their visa and went to the  flat  of\n      Eijaz Pathan on the 8th floor of a building near the  Sea.   The  next\n      day some other accused also reached there.   Accused  Yeda  Yakub  met\n      them on a few occasions and told them that he was in  the  process  of\n      making arrangements for them  to  go  to  Pakistan  where  they  would\n      receive their training.  However, he (A-128) could not go to  Pakistan\n      as the said training could not be  arranged,  and  hence,  he  (A-128)\n      returned to Bombay on 1.3.1993.  He (A-128) was arrested from Bhusawal\n      when he was with his newly wedded wife.  However, he had not committed\n      any overt act  so  far  as  the  Bombay  blasts  dated  12.3.1993  are\n      concerned.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_799\">      528.

He (A-128) was fully  aware\n      that the co-accused were smuggling silver, as well  as  the  arms  and\n      ammunition.  He had gone to Dubai for the purpose of traveling further\n      to Pakistan for weapons training.  He (A-128) could not go to Pakistan\n      but waited for 15 days in Dubai and later  returned  to  Bombay.   His\n      expenses for traveling to Dubai and back were met by  the  co-accused.\n      He participated twice in the landing and transportation  of  arms  and\n      ammunition.  His confessional statement makes it abundantly clear that\n      his statement was voluntary.  He was given sufficient time to re-think\n      and was allowed to stay in the CBI office for a period  of  48  hours,\n      and he (A-128) made it clear that during this period no body had  met,\n      pressurised, threatened or intimidated him.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_800\">      Confessional statement of Munna @Mohammad Ali (A-24):\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_801\">      529.

This prosecution case also stood corroborated  by  Sultan-E-Rome\n      Sardar Ali Gul (A-114), Abdul Aziz Abdul Kader (A-126),  Mohmed  Iqbal\n      Ibrahim (A-127), Eijaz Mohd.

Harishchand Laxman Surve (PW-108) and Vijay Govind More (PW-137)\n      were employed as watchmen, and they  have  also  deposed  against  the\n      appellant (A-128) as regards his presence there alongwith the other co-\n      accused when they came to Wangni Tower from Shekhadi with arms etc.\n      Evidence of witnesses:\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_809\">      535.       In addition thereto, the case of the prosecution  has  been\n      supported by H.C. Singh (PW-474), Superintendent of  Police,  CBI  who\n      recorded the confessional  statement  of  the  appellant  (A-128)  and\n      Massey C Fernandes (PW-311), a former employee of Hans Pvt.  Ltd.  who\n      arranged tickets for  Shahnawaz Khan (A-128)  and  others,  and  Vijay\n      Govind More (PW-137), an employee of Abu Travel  Agency,  who  deposed\n      to the effect that 11 persons’ tickets were arranged by him  and  that\n      payment for the same was made by the co-accused.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_810\">      536.    The appellant (A-128) made a retraction  of  his  confessional\n      statement  on  1.7.1994  i.e.,  within  two  months  of  making   such\n      confessional statement, stating that he never made  any  statement  at\n      all and that he had been forced to make a confessional  statement  and\n      was also forced to sign on blank papers.  He had  hence  been  falsely\n      implicated in the said case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_811\">      537.  In his statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_286\">Section  313</a>  of  the  Code  of  Criminal\n      Procedure, 1973, while replying to  Question  Nos.  218  and  292,  he\n      denied his participation in the Shekhadi landing of weapons and in the\n      transportation of the same to Bombay.  He also denied that he had gone\n      to Dubai to execute a certain conspiracy and in fact, rather suggested\n      that he had gone there on a business trip.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_812\">      538.  Upon  consideration  of  the  entire  evidence  on  record,  the\n      Designated  Court  held  that  the  same  leads  to  the   inescapable\n      conclusion of the appellant (A-128) being  involved  in  the  Shekhadi\n      landing operation as has been denoted by the  said  material  and  has\n      thus committed an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_287\">section 3(3)</a> TADA. It was further held\n      that considering the evidence  of  the  said  landing,  and  the  role\n      carried out by the appellant (A-128) and ultimately the fact  that  he\n      himself had continued with the said operation, and  had  not  provided\n      any information about the same to any proper authority, the  defence’s\n      contention that earlier he did not know the purpose for which  he  was\n      going to Shekhadi, or  that  he  was  not  aware  that  the  arms  and\n      ammunition were  to  be  smuggled,  is  liable  to  be  rejected.  The\n      confession of the appellant (A-128) itself reveals,  that  during  the\n      course of said operation he became fully aware of the  nature  of  the\n      contraband goods i.e.,  the  same   being  arms  and  ammunition.  The\n      appellant (A-128) being taken to Bombay for the execution of the  said\n      operation, and thereafter being sent to  Dubai  for  training  denotes\n      that he was a man in whom Tiger Memon (AA) had confidence, as  he  did\n      in the other conspirators.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_813\">            However since the appellant (A-128) committed the aforementioned\n      relevant acts much before the main conspiracy of  actually  committing\n      the bomb blasts planned and had not participated in  any  meetings  or\n      committed any acts in furtherance of the said main conspiracy, it  was\n      held that he could not be  held  guilty  for  the  offence  of  larger\n      conspiracy i.e. first charge, but is required to be  held  guilty  for\n      the conspiracy to commit terrorist acts as aforementioned.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_814\">      539.  We find no evidence on record warranting interference  with  the\n      judgment of the learned Designated Court. The said appeal lacks  merit\n      and is thus, accordingly dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_815\">      Criminal Appeal No. 1032 of 2012\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_816\">      540.  Though respondent has been convicted for  various  offences,  he\n      has been acquitted of the charge of conspiracy. Hence, the  State  has\n      preferred this appeal against the order of acquittal.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_817\">      541.  Shri Mukul Gupta,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the\n      appellant has submitted that the evidence against the  respondent  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_818\">      128) has been his  own  confession,  and  confessional  statements  of\n      Sultan-E-Rome Sardar Ali Gul (A-114), Abdul Aziz Abdul Kader  (A-126),\n      Mohmed Iqbal Ibrahim (A-127), Shaikh Kasam @Babulal Ismail Shaikh  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_819\">      109), Manoj Kumar Gupta (A-24),  Shaikh  Mohmed  Ethesham  Haji  Gulam\n      Rasool Shaikh (A-58), Eijaz Mohd. Sharif @ Eijaz Pathan @ Sayyed Zakir\n      (A-137),  Nasir Abdul Kader Kewal (A-64), Murad Ibrahim Khan  (A-130),\n      and further depositions of H.C. Singh (PW-474), Harish  Chandra  Surve\n      (PW-108), Iftihar Ahmed Iqbal Ahmed (PW-317),  Abdul  Gafoor  (PW-197)\n      and Chaturbhuj  R.  Rode  (PW-222).   Thus,  he  ought  to  have  been\n      convicted for the first charge.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_820\">      542.  Shri Mushtaq Ahmad, learned counsel appearing for the respondent\n      has submitted that the Designated  Court  has  considered  the  entire\n      evidence, and after appreciating the same, it came to  the  conclusion\n      that the respondent was not guilty of the first charge of  conspiracy.\n      In view of the parameters laid down by this court,  no interference is\n      required against the order of acquittal. Hence, the appeal  is  liable\n      to be dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_821\">      543.  After appreciating the entire  evidence,  the  Designated  Court\n      came to the conclusion that the respondent (A-128) had participated in\n      landing and transportation of arms, ammunition and explosives. It  was\n      also concluded that he (A-128) had agreed to undergo weapons’ training\n      in Pakistan for committing terrorist acts. He also attended a  meeting\n      at Dubai alongwith co-conspirators to  plan  commission  of  terrorist\n      acts.  Thus, the respondent (A-128) was  found  guilty  of  conspiracy\n      only to the extent of commission of terrorist  acts  punishable  under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1992024/\" id=\"a_288\">Section 3(3)</a> TADA, and not of the larger conspiracy as he could not go\n      to Pakistan for training for handling of arms and ammunition.  He  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_822\">      128) had been acquitted of the charge of  larger  conspiracy  for  the\n      reason that he did not participate in any act after  his  return  from\n      Dubai on 1.3.1993.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_823\">      544.  The parameters laid down  by  this  court  in  entertaining  the\n      appeal against the order of acquittal have to be applied.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_824\">      545.  We do not find any cogent reason to  interfere  in  the  matter.\n      The appeal lacks merit and is accordingly dismissed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_825\">      546.  Before parting with the case, we may clarify that if the accused-\n      appellant(s) whose appeals have been dismissed and are on bail,  their\n      bail bonds are cancelled and they are  directed  to  surrender  within\n      four weeks from today, failing which  the  learned  Designated  Court,\n      TADA shall take them into custody and send them to jail to  serve  out\n      the remaining part of their sentences.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"pre_20\">                                       ………………………….J.
