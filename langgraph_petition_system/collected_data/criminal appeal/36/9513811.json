Callous   indifference   and   apathy,   extraneous\ninfluence or considerations and  the  cynical  “Chalta  Hai”  attitude  more\noften than not costs the society dearly in  man-made  tragedies  whether  in\nthe form of fire incidents, collapse of  buildings  and  bridges,  poisonous\ngas  leaks  or  the  like.   Short-lived   media   attention   followed   by\ninvestigations that at times leave the end result flawed and a long  winding\ncriminal trial in  which  the  witnesses  predecease  their  depositions  or\nswitch sides under pressure or for gain and where even the victims or  their\nfamilies lose interest brings the sad saga to an uncertain end.  A  somewhat\nsimilar story is presented in these appeals by special leave arising out  of\na common judgment and order dated 19th December, 2008  passed  by  a  Single\nJudge of High Court of Delhi whereby a batch of criminal  appeals  filed  by\nthose convicted by the trial Court for commission of different offences  and\nthe sentences awarded to them were disposed of alongwith  criminal  revision\npetition no.17 of 2008  filed  by  the  Association  of  Victims  of  Uphaar\nTragedy (hereinafter, “AVUT”) that led to the death of  59  persons  besides\ninjuries to nearly 100 others.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.    The High Court has, on a reappraisal of the evidence  adduced  at  the\ntrial, acquitted five of  the  appellants  before  it  while  upholding  the\nconvictions of the rest with  or  without  modification  of  the  nature  of\noffence in some cases and reduction of the sentence in others. We  shall  in\nthe course of this judgment refer in detail to the view taken by  the  Trial\nCourt and the extent and nature of modification made to  that  by  the  High\nCourt in the impugned judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_4\">3.    Suffice it to say that the fire incident that claimed  valuable  human\nlives took place in the heart of the capital  city  of  Delhi  in  a  cinema\nbuilding situate in its posh Green Park Extension area on 13th  June,  1997.\nThe factual backdrop in which the unfortunate victims lost  their  lives  or\nsuffered injuries has been set out by the Trial Court in  its  judgment  and\nreiterated by the  High  Court  in  the  order  passed  by  it  without  any\nsignificant changes in the narrative.  In the Trial Court, as  in  the  High\nCourt and even before us there was no serious dispute as  to  the  cause  of\nthe fire leading to the loss of human lives.  We,  therefore,  would  remain\ncontent with the broad narration of the facts  as  are  available  from  the\norder passed by the Trial Court and that passed by  the  High  Court,  which\nare as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">The Incident:\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.    Uphaar Cinema building, situate on a plot  of  2480  square  yards  at\nGreen  Park  Extension  Shopping  Centre,  New  Delhi,  comprised  a  cinema\nauditorium with a sanctioned capacity of 750 seats besides a balcony with  a\nsanctioned capacity of 250 seats. The cinema auditorium comprised the  first\nfloor of the cinema complex while the balcony was constructed on the  second\nfloor. The ground floor of the building  comprised  a  parking  lot  besides\nthree separate rooms on the western side, one of which was used for  placing\na 500 KVA electric transformer that supplied electric energy to  the  cinema\ntheatre while the other was used for housing a  1000  KVA  transformer  that\nwas  installed  and  maintained  by  the  Delhi  Vidyut  Board  (hereinafter\nreferred to as “DVB”). It is common ground that the second transformer  even\nthough located within the cinema premises, did  not  supply  electricity  to\nthe cinema but rather  to  some  of  the  tenants  occupying  parts  of  the\ncommercial complex that formed  a  part  of  the  building  and  some  other\nconsumers from the locality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.    The prosecution case is that on 13th June, 1997  at  about  6.55  a.m.\nthe bigger of the two transformers installed and maintained by  DVB  on  the\nground floor of the  Uphaar  Cinema  building  caught  fire.  The  fire  was\nbrought under control by 7.25 a.m. Inspection  of  the  transformer  by  the\nSuperintendant of the DVB and his  team  revealed  that  three  of  the  low\ntension cable leads of the transformer had been partially  burnt.  At  about\n10.30 a.m., B.M. Satija (A-9) and A.K.  Gera  (A-10),  Inspectors  from  DVB\nalong with  Senior  Fitter,  Bir  Singh  (A-11)  conducted  repairs  on  the\ntransformer by replacing two aluminium sockets on the  B-Phase  of  the  low\ntension cable leads. The repairs, it appear, were carried out with the  help\nof a dye and hammer without the use of a crimping machine.  The  transformer\nwas recharged for resumption of electric supply by 11.30 a.m. on 13th  June,\n1997.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">6.    The prosecution alleges that repairs conducted on the  transformer  in\nthe earlier part of the  day  were  unsatisfactory  and  resulted  in  loose\nconnections that caused sparking on the B-Phase  of  the  transformer  where\nsuch repairs were carried out. This resulted in the loosening of one of  the\ncables of the transformer which eventually came  off  and  started  dangling\nloose along the radiator and burnt a hole in the radiator fin. Through  this\nhole the transformer oil started leaking out which, on account of  the  heat\ngenerated by the loose cable touching against the radiator, ignited the  oil\nat about 4.55 p.m. on 13th June, 1997. Since the transformer  did  not  have\nan oil  soak  pit  as  required  under  the  regulations  and  the  standard\npractice, the oil that spread out of the  enclosure  continued  leaking  and\nspreading the fire to the adjacent parking lot where cars were parked  at  a\ndistance of no more than a metre from  the  door  of  the  transformer.  The\nresult was that all the cars parked in the parking area on the ground  floor\nof the cinema hall were ablaze. Smoke started billowing in the northern  and\nsouthward directions in the parking lot of the cinema complex. The  northern\nbound smoke encountered a gate which was adjacent to a staircase leading  to\nthe cinema auditorium on the first floor. Due to chimney effect,  the  smoke\ngushed into the stairwell  and  eventually  entered  the  cinema  auditorium\nthrough a door and through the air conditioning ducts. The  southward  bound\nsmoke similarly travelled aerially through another staircase  and  into  the\nlower portion of the balcony of the auditorium from the left side. All  this\nhappened while a large number  of  people  were  seated  in  the  auditorium\nenjoying the matinee  show  of  ‘BORDER’,  a  popular  Hindi  movie  with  a\npatriotic theme. Because of  smoke  and  carbon  monoxide  released  by  the\nburning oil and other combustible material, the  people  in  the  auditorium\nstarted suffocating.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">7.    The Shift  In-charge  of  the  Green  Park  Complaint  Centre  of  DVB\nreceived a telephonic message from K.L. Malhotra (A-4), since deceased,  who\nwas the Deputy General Manager of Uphaar Cinema at  the  relevant  point  of\ntime, regarding the fire. It was only then that the AIIMS grid to which  the\ntransformer in question was connected was  switched  off  and  the  flow  of\nenergy to the cinema complex  stopped.  According  to  the  prosecution  the\nsupply of the 11 KV outgoing Green Park Feeder  tripped  off  at  5.05  p.m.\nthereby discontinuing the supply of energy to the cinema.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">8.    Inside the auditorium and balcony there was complete pandemonium.  The\npeople in the balcony are said to have rushed towards  the  exits  in  pitch\ndarkness as there were neither emergency lights  nor  any  cinema  staff  to\nhelp or guide them. The prosecution  alleged  that  no  public  announcement\nregarding the fire was made to those inside the auditorium or  the  balcony,\nnor were any  fire  alarms  set  off,  no  matter  the  management  and  the\nemployees of the Uphaar Cinema were aware  of  the  fact  that  a  fire  had\nbroken out. Even the Projector Operator was not given instructions  to  stop\nthe film while the fire was raging nor was any  patron  informed  about  the\nsituation outside. On the contrary, the doors to the middle entrance of  the\nbalcony were found to be bolted by the gatekeeper-Manmohan Uniyal (A-8)  who\nhad left his  duty  without  handing  over  charge  to  his  reliever.  More\nimportantly, the prosecution case is that  the  addition  of  a  private  8-\nseater box had completely closed off the exit  on  the  right  side  of  the\nbalcony, while the addition of a total of 52 extra seats over the years  had\ncompletely blocked the gangway on the right side of the balcony.  Similarly,\nthe gangway on the right of the middle entrance was  significantly  narrower\nthan required under the regulations. It was alleged that Sushil Ansal  (A-1)\nand Gopal Ansal (A-2), the owners of  the  cinema  hall,  had  knowledge  of\nthese deviations from fire safety norms despite  which  they  had  continued\nexhibiting films, thereby endangering the lives of all those who  patronized\nthe  theatre.   All   these   obstructions,   deviations,   violations   and\ndeficiencies had, according to the  prosecution,  resulted  in  the  victims\ngetting trapped in the balcony for at least 10-15 minutes exposing  them  to\nlethal  carbon  monoxide,  to  which  as  many  as  59  persons   eventually\nsuccumbed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">9.    Rescue operations attempted by the fire tenders from the Bhikaji  Cama\nPlace and Safdarjung Fire Stations were  undertaken  after  the  Delhi  Fire\nService received a complaint from K.L. Malhotra (A-4),  since  deceased,  at\n5.10 p.m. The fire tenders took nearly forty five minutes  to  one  hour  to\nextinguish the fire and to rescue the persons  trapped  in  the  balcony  by\nopening the bolted doors and  taking  those  who  had  collapsed  and  those\ninjured to the hospitals. No  one  from  the  staff  or  management  of  the\ntheatre was, according to the prosecution, present at the  spot  to  lend  a\nhelping hand in the rescue operations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\"> Investigation and Charges:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">10.   Investigation into the fire incident  and  the  resultant  causalities\nstarted pursuant to FIR No.432/97 registered at Police  Station,  Hauz  Khas\non the basis of a written complaint filed  by  one  Sudhir  Kumar,  Security\nGuard, employed by the management of the cinema complex.  The  investigation\nwas initially  conducted  by  the  Delhi  Police  but  was  soon  thereafter\ntransferred to the Crime Branch and eventually  to  the  Central  Bureau  of\nInvestigation under the <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_1\">Delhi Special Police Establishment  Act,  1946</a>.  The\nCBI registered case bearing No.RC-3(S)/97/SIC.IV/New  Delhi  on  25th  July,\n1997.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">11.   The investigating agencies first looked into  the  incidents  of  fire\nand got prepared and seized the record relevant thereto, including a  report\nsigned by B.M. Satija (A-9), A.K. Gera (A-10), Inspectors and Bir Singh  (A-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">11) Senior Fitter, which dealt with the nature of repair that was  conducted\non the DVB transformer after the first incident. The investigating  agencies\nalso looked into the chain of events that led to the second fire  at  around\n5.00 p.m. and the  entry  of  smoke  into  the  cinema  auditorium  and  the\nbalcony. A report from the Central  Building  Research  Institute  was  also\nobtained by the investigating  agencies  on  17th  August,  1997  under  the\nsignatures of T.P. Sharma (PW-25). Expert opinion of K.V.  Singh,  Executive\nEngineer (Electrical), PWD was also obtained by the  investigating  officers\non 29th June, 1997,  in  addition  to  two  CFSL  reports  prepared  by  Dr.\nRajender Singh forwarded to the Hauz Khas Police Station on 27th June,  1997\nand to the CBI on 11th August, 1997. These reports were marked Exs. PW  64/B\nand PW 64/D at the trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">12.   The investigating officers also examined the cause  of  malfunctioning\nof the DVB transformer and obtained a report Ex. PW24/A in that regard  from\nMr. K.L. Grover, Electrical  Inspector  and  Mr.  A.K.  Aggarwal,  Assistant\nElectrical Inspector on 25th June, 1997. The report obtained from  Professor\nM.L. Kothari of IIT, New Delhi, on 2nd July, 1997  analysed  and  attributed\nthe cause of fire to malfunctioning of the DVB transformer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">13.    The  investigating  agencies  then  looked  into  the   fire   safety\ndeviations in the Uphaar Cinema building to determine whether the  same  had\ncontributed to the fire and hindered the  escape  of  those  seated  in  the\ncinema auditorium and balcony from the poisonous carbon  monoxide  that  had\npolluted  the  atmosphere  inside  the  complex.  Reports   from   Executive\nEngineers, MCD were also obtained in this  regard.   A  Panchnama  depicting\nfloor-wise deviations in the Uphaar Cinema building and  an  Inspection-cum-\nScrutiny report marked as Ex.PW 2/A  indicating  the  structural  deviations\nwas also submitted by the MCD to the CBI on 11th August, 1997.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">14.   Similarly, the investigating agencies collected a fire  report  marked\nEx. PW 49/E from the Delhi Fire  Service  regarding  the  rescue  operations\nconducted by the fire service personnel on the date of the occurrence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">15.   Post-mortem conducted on the dead body of Captain  M.S.  Bhinder,  one\nof  the  unfortunate  victims,  revealed  that  the  cause  of   death   was\nasphyxiation. From the report of Dr. T.D. Dogra, Forensic  Expert,  obtained\non 18th September, 1997,  the  investigating  officers  concluded  that  the\nrapid death of the victims  could  have  been  caused  by  inhalation  of  a\ncombination of toxic gases including carbon  monoxide  and  sulphur  dioxide\nwhich were produced by combustion of articles like  diesel,  petrol,  rubber\nand styrene.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">16.   Statements of a  large  number  of  witnesses  relevant  to  the  fire\nincident, its causes and effects were also  recorded  by  the  investigating\nagencies  from  time  to  time  culminating  in  the  filing  of  a   common\nchargesheet against 16  persons  accusing  them  of  commission  of  several\noffences punishable both under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">Indian Penal Code</a>,  1860  as  also  under\nthe provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_3\">Cinematograph Act, 1952</a>. What  is  important  is  that\nwhile accused A-1, A-2, A-12, A-13 and A-14 were charged with commission  of\noffences punishable under Sections 304A, 337, 338 read with <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 36</a>,  IPC\nand  <a href=\"/doc/1107870/\" id=\"a_5\">Section  14</a>  of  the  Cinematograph  Act,  1952,  accused  A-3  to  A-8\ncomprising the management and gatekeeper of the  Cinema  were  charged  with\ncommission of offences punishable under Sections 304,  337,  338  read  with\n<a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 36</a>,  IPC  and  <a href=\"/doc/1107870/\" id=\"a_7\">Section  14</a>  of  the  Cinematograph  Act,  1952.  The\nemployees of DVB namely Inspectors B.M. Satija (A-9), A.K. Gera  (A-10)  and\nSenior Fitter, Bir Singh (A-11) were also charged  with  the  commission  of\noffences punishable under Sections 304, 337 and 338 read with <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 36</a>  of\nthe IPC.  As regards the remaining three accused  namely,  N.D.  Tiwari  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">14), H.S.

Since some of  the  offences  with  which  the  accused  persons  were\ncharged were triable by the Court of Sessions, the case  was  committed  for\ntrial to Additional Sessions Judge, New Delhi, who framed  specific  charges\nagainst Sushil Ansal (A-1), Gopal Ansal (A-2) and the rest of  the  accused.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">18.   Sushil Ansal (A-1) and Gopal Ansal (A-2), who happen to  be  brothers,\nwere charged with offences punishable under Sections 304A read with  Section\n36 and Sections 337 and 338 read with <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 36</a>  IPC  for  their  negligent\nacts of  omission  and  commission  of  allowing  installation  of  the  DVB\ntransformer, various structural and fire safety deviations in  the  building\nin violation of various Rules and not facilitating  the  escape  of  patrons\nwhich caused the death of 59 persons and simple  and  grievous  injuries  to\n100 others in the fire incident mentioned  above.  They  were  also  charged\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1107870/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 14</a> of the Cinematograph Act, 1952  for  contravention  of  the\nprovisions of the Delhi Cinematograph Rules, 1953 (hereinafter  referred  to\nas ‘DCR, 1953’) and Delhi Cinematograph Rules,  1981  (hereinafter  referred\nto ‘DCR, 1981’).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">19.

Chopra  (A-6),  Ajit\nChoudhary (A-7), since deceased and Manmohan Uniyal (A-8),  gatekeeper  were\nalso charged with commission of offences punishable under Section  304  read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 36</a> of IPC since, despite being present at the time of the  fire\nincident, they failed to inform, alert and  facilitate  the  escape  of  the\npatrons from the balcony during the  fire  while  knowing  fully  well  that\ntheir act was likely to cause death or such bodily injuries  as  was  likely\nto cause death.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">20.   Similarly, B.M. Satija (A-9), A.K. Gera (A-10) and  Bir  Singh  (A-11)\nwere charged with commission of offences punishable under Section  304  read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 36</a> IPC in that they had not used the required crimping  machine\nwhile repairing the DVB transformer after the first fire  incident  on  13th\nJune, 1997 knowing fully well that this could and did cause the  transformer\nto catch fire once again and result in the death or  bodily  injury  as  was\nlikely to cause death of persons in the building.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">21.   The rest of the accused persons  namely,  S.N.  Dandona  (A-12)  since\ndeceased, S.S. Sharma (A-13), N.D. Tiwari (A-14),  H.S.  Panwar  (A-15)  and\nSurender Dutt (A-16) since deceased, were charged with  offences  punishable\nunder Sections 304A, 337 and 338 IPC read with Section 36  IPC  for  causing\nthe death of 59 persons and simple and grievous injuries to  100  others  by\ntheir acts and omissions of negligently issuing  No  Objection  Certificates\nto Uphaar Cinema without ensuring that the statutory requirements  for  fire\nsafety and means of escape were adhered to.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">22.   All the accused persons pleaded  not  guilty  to  the  charges  framed\nagainst them and claimed a trial. Not only that,  all  of  them  filed  writ\npetitions before the Delhi High Court  against  the  order  framing  charges\npassed by the Trial Court which were dismissed by the High  Court  in  terms\nof four separate orders  passed  by  it.  A  Special  Leave  Petition  filed\nagainst the order of dismissal of the writ petition by  Sushil  Ansal  (A-1)\nwas dismissed as withdrawn by an order  of  this  Court  dated  12th  April,\n2002.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">Evidence at the Trial:\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_26\">23.   At the trial the prosecution examined as  many  as  115  witnesses  in\nsupport of its case apart from placing reliance upon  nearly  893  documents\nmarked in the course of the proceedings. The oral evidence  adduced  broadly\ncomprised depositions of witnesses whom providence helped  to  escape  alive\nfrom the cinema complex on the fateful day.  These  witnesses  narrated  the\nevents inside the cinema hall and the confusion that prevailed after  people\nstarted suffocating because of smoke entering from in front  of  the  screen\nand through the AC  ducts  before  the  hall  was  eventually  plunged  into\ndarkness, leaving the people inside trapped without any emergency lights  or\nhelp coming from any quarter. Those in the balcony  found  that  they  could\nnot escape since all the  doors  were  locked.  The  depositions  comprising\nKanwaljeet Kaur (PW-1), Karan Kumar (PW-3), Rishi Arora  (PW-7),  Amit  (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">8), Hans Raj (PW-11) and Satpal Singh (PW-12) gave graphic accounts  of  the\nsituation that prevailed inside the cinema hall and  the  rescue  operations\nafter the Fire Brigade arrived to help them out.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">24.   The evidence also comprised the depositions of  Neelam  Krishnamoorthy\n(PW-4), Ajay Mehra (PW-5), Harish Dang (PW-6), Satish Khanna (PW-9),  Kishan\nKumar Kohli (PW-10), Raman Singh Sidhu  (PW-13)  and  Surjit  Singh  (PW-66)\nrelatives of some of the victims, who narrated  their  travails  and  proved\nthe death certificates of those lost in the tragedy.  Neelam  Krishnamoorthy\n(PW-4) happens to be the unfortunate mother of two who were  seated  in  the\nrightmost two seats in the front row of the balcony.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">25.   Some of the onlookers and others who helped in the  rescue  operations\nwere also examined by the prosecution apart from the officers of  the  Delhi\nFire Service. R.C. Sharma (PW-49)  Chief  Fire  Officer,  testified  to  the\npresence of smoke in the stairwell and the balcony and stated that he  could\nnot open the balcony door until he received  help  of  two  other  officers.\nDepositions of B.L. Jindal (PW-15) and Ram Kumar Gupta (PW-17) who  happened\nto be the Assistant Engineer and Junior Engineer  respectively  of  the  MCD\nwere also recorded. A large number of 14 witnesses were  examined  to  prove\nthe structural deviations in  the  building  upon  an  inspection  conducted\nafter the fire incident. An  equally  large  number  of  33  witnesses  were\nexamined to prove documents relied upon by the prosecution.  Witnesses  were\nalso  examined  to  prove  the  sanction  orders  issued  by  the  competent\nauthority to prosecute some  of  the  accused  who  happened  to  be  public\nservants. Evidence regarding the ownership,  management  and  administration\nof  the  company  which  owned  Uphaar  Cinema,  M/s  Green  Park   Theaters\nAssociated (P) Ltd. was also adduced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_30\">26.   Medical evidence led at the trial  comprised  the  deposition  of  Dr.\nT.D.

In  addition,  Dr.  S.\nSatyanarayan (PW-77) who conducted the  post-mortem  on  the  dead  body  of\nCaptain M.S. Bhinder  was  also  recorded.  Officials  from  DVB  and  those\nconnected with the  investigation  too  were  examined  by  the  prosecution\nbefore closing its case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">Findings of the Trial Court:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">27.   The Trial Court appraised the evidence led at the trial including  the\ndepositions of three defence witnesses, one each, examined  by  H.S.  Panwar\n(A-15), Bir Singh (A-11) and A.K. Gera  (A-10)  and  recorded  findings  and\nconclusions that may be summarized as under:\n</p>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(a)   That Uphaar Cinema was owned by a company that  was  closely  held  by\nSushil Ansal (A-1) and Gopal Ansal (A-2) and other members of  their  family\nand that several violations regarding the installation of a transformer  and\nthe seating  arrangement  in  the  balcony,  structural  deviations  in  the\nbuilding were committed while Sushil Ansal (A-1) and Gopal Ansal (A-2)  were\neither Directors or the Managing Directors of the said company.  Even  after\nthe alleged resignation  of  the  Ansal  brothers  in  the  year  1988  they\ncontinued to be in control of the management of the cinema and  the  running\nof its day-to-day affairs, including exercising control  over  the  Managers\nand other staff employed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      (1)   In coming to that conclusion, the Trial Court relied  upon  both\n      documentary and oral evidence adduced before it  by  the  prosecution.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_33\">      The Trial Court found that application dated 2nd February,  1973  made\n      to the erstwhile DESU for grant of electricity connection  for  Uphaar\n      Cinema was signed by Sushil Ansal (A-1).  So  also  letter  dated  2nd\n      February, 1973 by which the company had agreed to give DESU two  rooms\n      for their transformer and HT and LT panels at a nominal rent of Rs.11/-\n       per year was signed by Sushil Ansal (A-1). The fact that the original\n      licence granted to Uphaar Cinema was granted in favour  of  M/s  Green\n      Park Theatres Associated (P) Ltd. (in  short,  “GPT”)  through  Sushil\n      Ansal (A-1) as the Managing Director at that time, as  also  the  fact\n      that Sushil Ansal (A-1) continued to be  representative  licensee  for\n      the cinema was also relied upon by the Trial Court in support  of  its\n      conclusion that Sushil Ansal (A-1) exercised  control  and  management\n      over Uphaar Cinema at the relevant point of time.  Reliance  was  also\n      placed by the Trial Court upon letter dated 19th June, 1974 written on\n      behalf of GPT by Sushil Ansal (A-1) whereby the Entertainment  Officer\n      was requested to permit the owner to lease out the top floor of Uphaar\n      Cinema  for  office  use  and  the   ground   floor   for   commercial\n      establishments. An affidavit dated 21st March, 1975 and  letter  dated\n      2nd April, 1979 filed in connection with renewal of the cinema license\n      were also relied upon by the Trial Court to show that Sushil Ansal (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_34\">      1) was not only the licensee of Uphaar Cinema, but also  that  he  had\n      held himself out in that capacity before  the  concerned  authorities.\n      Letter  of  authority  authorizing  V.K.  Bedi,  Architect,  to  deal,\n      discuss, explain and make corrections in the building plan as well  as\n      to collect the sanction plan on his behalf as also reply to show-cause\n      notice dated 11th May, 1981  issued  by  the  Deputy  Commissioner  of\n      Police (Licensing) [in short, “DCP (L)”] which too was sent by  Sushil\n      Ansal (A-1) as licensee for GPT were relied upon by the Trial Court to\n      buttress its  conclusion  that  Sushil  Ansal  (A-1)  was  the  person\n      exercising control over the affairs of the  cinema  and  its  Managing\n      Director.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">      (2)   The Trial Court noted  that  although  Sushil  Ansal  (A-1)  had\n      resigned from the Directorship of the company on 17th  October,  1988,\n      he had continued to be the licensee of the cinema as is  evident  from\n      an affidavit dated 3rd March, 1992 (Ex. PW50/B) addressed to  DCP  (L)\n      seeking renewal of the license for the  years  1992-93.  In  the  said\n      affidavit the Trial Court observed that  Sushil  Ansal  (A-1)  clearly\n      mentioned that he  continued  to  be  the  occupier  of  the  licensed\n      premises and the owner of the Cinematograph. Minutes of the meeting of\n      the Board of Directors held on 24th December, 1994 were  also  noticed\n      by the Trial Court to show that although Sushil Ansal  (A-1)  resigned\n      from the Directorship of the company in 1988 he had  continued  to  be\n      involved in the affairs of the cinema, no matter in the capacity of  a\n      Special Invitee. Reliance was also placed by the Trial Court upon  the\n      inspection proformas of the Delhi Fire Service for the years 1995-1997\n      to show that Sushil Ansal (A-1) continued to be shown as  licensee  of\n      Uphaar Cinema.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">      (3)   The Trial Court placed reliance upon the financial authority and\n      the control exercised by Sushil Ansal (A-1)  in  the  affairs  of  the\n      cinema hall. In this regard the Trial Court referred to a  self-cheque\n      (Ex.PW91/B) dated 26th June, 1995 for a  sum  of  rupees  fifty  lakhs\n      drawn by Sushil Ansal (A-1) from the accounts of GPT.  Closer  to  the\n      date of occurrence, the Board of Directors of the company had on  25th\n      March, 1996 passed a resolution  authorising  Sushil  Ansal  (A-1)  to\n      operate the bank accounts of the company upto any  amount.  The  Trial\n      Court also relied upon other circumstances to support  its  conclusion\n      that although Sushil Ansal (A-1) claims  to  have  resigned  from  the\n      Directorship of the company in the year 1988, he continued to  be  the\n      heart and soul of the company and in complete management of the cinema\n      affairs. Reliance was also placed upon Ex. PW103/XX3 by  which  Sushil\n      Ansal (A-1) was appointed authorized signatory to operate the  Current\n      Accounts with various banks.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_37\">      (4)   The Trial Court similarly referred to and  relied  upon  several\n      pieces of documentary evidence in holding that Gopal Ansal (A-2)  also\n      exercised extensive control over the affairs of the cinema. The Court,\n      in particular, relied upon the resolution of the  Board  of  Directors\n      passed on 15th July, 1972 (Ex.PW103/XX) according to which Gopal Ansal\n      (A-2) was  authorised  to  sign  all  documents,  drawings  and  other\n      connected  papers  regarding  the   submission   of   revised   plans,\n      applications for electricity  connections  concerning  Uphaar  Cinema,\n      etc. Letter dated 24th May, 1978 (Ex. PW110/AA20), addressed by  Gopal\n      Ansal (A-2) as Director, GPT seeking permission to install  an  eight-\n      seater box and reply dated 6th December, 1979 to the show-cause notice\n      for removal of one hundred extra seats after withdrawal  of  the  1979\n      resolution which was signed by Gopal Ansal (A-2) as  Director  of  GPT\n      were also relied upon by the Trial Court. Similarly, letter dated 29th\n      July, 1980  addressed  to  DCP(L)  for  the  installation  of  fifteen\n      additional seats in the balcony was found  to  have  been  written  by\n      Gopal Ansal (A-2) as Director, GPT. Reply  to  the  show-cause  notice\n      dated 28th May, 1982 was similarly found to have been given  by  Gopal\n      Ansal (A-2) as Director of GPT  in  which  he  tried  to  explain  the\n      reasons for the bolting of doors from the inside during exhibition  of\n      a film and gave assurance that the utmost precaution would be taken by\n      the management in future.  The Trial Court also relied upon  the  fact\n      that the car parking contract was granted  by  Gopal  Ansal  (A-2)  as\n      Director of GPT in April, 1988.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">      (5)   The Trial Court further relied upon the Minutes of  the  Meeting\n      held on 25th March, 1996 of the Board  of  Directors  of  the  company\n      appointing Gopal Ansal (A-2) as authorised signatory upto  any  amount\n      to operate the bank accounts.  Cheques issued  by  Gopal  Ansal  (A-2)\n      subsequent to the said authorisation in favour of the  Chief  Engineer\n      (Water) and in favour of the Music Shop from the accounts of GPT which\n      later was rechristened as Ansal Theaters &amp;  Clubotels  (P)  Ltd.  were\n      also relied upon by the Trial Court in support of its conclusion  that\n      Gopal Ansal (A-2), like his brother Sushil  Ansal  (A-1),  even  after\n      resigning from the Directorship of the company, continued to  exercise\n      control over the affairs of the cinema complex. This was, according to\n      the Trial Court, evident from the fact  that  Gopal  Ansal  (A-2)  was\n      appointed authorised signatory to operate the current accounts, as was\n      the case for Sushil Ansal (A-1) also.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">      (6)   Last but not the least, the Trial Court relied upon the  Minutes\n      of the Meeting dated 27th February, 1997 (Ex. PW98/X4) in which  Gopal\n      Ansal (A-2), described as “MD” of the company, is said to have desired\n      that not even a nail be put in the cinema premises without  his  prior\n      permission. Similarly, in the Minutes of the MD Conferences dated  2nd\n      April, 1997 and 1st May, 1997, Gopal Ansal (A-2), described as “MD  in\n      Chair”, issued instructions in this capacity regarding a large  number\n      of business decisions and day-to-day affairs of the company. The Trial\n      Court held that Gopal Ansal (A-2) was proved to  be  MD  in  Chair  by\n      letters marked (Ex. PW98/X-2) and (Ex. PW98/X-3). He was also shown to\n      be “MD in Chair” for the MD Conference held on 7th May, 1997 in  terms\n      of letter dated 9th May, 1997 marked Ex. PW98/X-C.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_40\">(b)   That a 750 KVA DVB transformer was installed in  the  cinema  premises\nin complete violation  of  the  Electricity  Rules  and  in  breach  of  the\nsanctioned plan for the building.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">      (1)   The Trial Court found that the sanctioned plan marked  Ex.  PW15\n      Y/3 provided for  three  adjacent  rooms  on  the  ground  floor  each\n      measuring 20x10 feet to be used for installation of a transformer. The\n      first of these three rooms was to be used for  HT  cables  that  would\n      bring high voltage current from the AIIMS Grid  Station.   The  second\n      room was to be used for installing the  transformer  that  would  step\n      down the high density current and transmit the same to the third  room\n      which was meant for LT cables from where the  current  would  then  be\n      supplied to the cinema building.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_42\">      (2)   Relying upon the report submitted by Mr.  K.L.  Grover  (PW-24),\n      the Electrical Inspector,  the  Trial  Court  concluded  that  it  was\n      essential for the management of the cinema to obtain  permission  from\n      the Licensing Department as also from  the  Municipal  Corporation  of\n      Delhi (in  short,  “MCD”)  prior  to  the  installation  of  the  said\n      transformer. Instead of doing so,  the  internal  positioning  of  the\n      walls of the transformer area comprising  the  three  rooms  mentioned\n      above was changed without so much as notifying the MCD about the  said\n      change or obtaining its sanction for the same. Reliance was,  in  this\n      regard, placed by the Trial Court upon the depositions of R.N.  Gupta,\n      Executive Engineer,  MCD  (PW-2)  and  Shri  K.L.  Grover,  Electrical\n      Inspector (PW-24).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">      (3)    The  Trial  Court  also  looked  into   the   Rules   regarding\n      installation of transformers in the Bureau of Indian  Standard:  10028\n      (Part II) - 1981 and the Building Bye Laws,  1983  to  hold  that  the\n      installation of the transformer in question  did  not  adhere  to  the\n      following three distinct requirements under the rules:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">           (i)    The  two  transformers  namely  one  installed   by   the\n                 management of the company owning the cinema and  the  other\n                 installed by the DVB were not separated by a fire resistant\n                 wall as required in Para 3.6.2, IS: 10028 (Part II) – 1981.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">           (ii)  The transformers did not have oil soak pits necessary  for\n                 soaking the entire  oil  content  in  the  transformers  as\n                 required in Paras 3.6.3 and 3.6.4, IS: 10028  (Part  II)  -\n                 1981.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">           (iii) The rooms where the transformers were kept  did  not  have\n                 proper ventilation and free movement of  air  on  all  four\n                 sides of the transformers, nor were  adequately  sized  air\n                 inlets and outlets provided to ensure efficient cooling  of\n                 the transformers as required in Paras 7.3.1.1 and  7.3.1.4,\n                 IS: 10028 (Part II) – 1981.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      (4)   Having said so, the Trial Court rejected the contention urged on\n      behalf of the Ansal brothers (A-1 and A-2) that they were coerced into\n      providing space for the DVB transformer by the  DVB  authorities.  The\n      Court found that correspondence exchanged  between  GPT  and  the  DVB\n      authorities did not suggest that the Ansals  were  forced  to  provide\n      space for the DVB transformer as contended by them.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(c)   That the condition of the DVB transformer  was  wholly  unsatisfactory\nand that the fire had started on  account  of  the  sparking  of  the  loose\nconnection of the cable and socket of the bar of the said transformer.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      (1)   Relying upon the depositions  of  K.L.

Kothari\n      from IIT (PW-36) and Dr. Rajinder Singh, Sr. Scientific Officer, CFSL,\n      (PW-64), as well as their respective inspection  reports,  marked  Ex.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">      PW24/A, Ex. PW25/A, Ex. PW35/A, Ex. PW36/A and Ex. PW64/B,  the  Court\n      held  that  the  condition  of  the   DVB   transformer   was   wholly\n      unsatisfactory on account of the following:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">           i) The  transformer  did  not  have  any  protection  system  as\n              required by the <a href=\"/doc/177537342/\" id=\"a_14\">Electricity Act</a>.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">          ii) The terminals on the LT side were  not  enclosed  in  a  box,\n              unlike in the case of the Uphaar transformer.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">         iii) The LT side cables from  the  bus  bar  lacked  any  kind  of\n              clamping system or support for the cables.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">          iv) There was no relay system connected to the HT Panel board  of\n              the DVB transformer which could have tripped in case  of  any\n              fault.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">           v) The check nut of the neutral terminal was found to be loose.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">          vi) There were earth strips lying in  the  transformer  room  but\n              these were not properly joined.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">         vii) The connection between earth and neutral was also broken.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">        viii) The LT Panel’s outgoing switches did not have fuses.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">          ix) No HRC (High Rupture Capacity) fuses were found  and  use  of\n              wires, in lieu of it was not proper.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">           x) All the four oil circuit breakers were completely unprotected\n              against earth faults and over current.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">          xi) The potential transformer was found to be in the disconnected\n              condition of the OCB operation mechanism.   Its  battery  and\n              charger were also found to be defective and  heavily  damaged\n              in the fire.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">      (2)   The Court further held that fire  in  the  DVB  transformer  had\n      resulted on account of the sparking by the  loose  connection  of  the\n      cable end socket of the bus bar of the DVB transformer. The cable  end\n      socket of the B-phase bus bar was unsatisfactorily repaired  since  it\n      was fixed by hammering and not by using a  crimping  machine.  The  LT\n      cable got disconnected from the cables on the B-phase and made a  hole\n      in the radiator fin when the live conductor of the disconnected  cable\n      fell upon it.  Transformer oil gushed out of the  opening  on  to  the\n      floor, while continued short circuiting of the cable with the radiator\n      fin in the absence of a protection relay system caused sparking, which\n      in turn resulted in the oil from the transformer catching  fire.   The\n      sparking would have continued for a significant amount of  time  since\n      there was no immediate tripping system  available  in  the  HT  panel.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_45\">      Tripping was ultimately found to have taken place at the  33  KV  sub-\n      station at AIIMS.  The main switch from the generator which was  going\n      to the AC blower was found to be fused.  The fuses were  found  to  be\n      inside the body of the switch. The condition  of  dust  covered  fuses\n      suggested that they had been out of use for a long time.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">(d)   That the parking of extra cars and the parking of cars  close  to  the\ntransformer in what was meant to be a 16 ft. wide passage for free  movement\nof the vehicles aggravated the situation and contributed  to  the  incident.\nThe Trial Court found that apart  from  petrol  and  diesel  cars,  CNG  gas\ncylinders and upholstery comprising combustible material emitted smoke  when\nburnt containing carbon monoxide,  carbon  dioxide  and  other  hydrocarbons\nwhich resulted in suffocation of those inside the balcony of the cinema.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">      (1)   The Trial Court held that  the  management  of  the  cinema  had\n      disregarded the requirements of law and the sanctioned  plan,  thereby\n      putting the lives of the patrons at risk. The Court found  that  there\n      was nothing on record to show that the Ansal brothers (A-1 and A-2) or\n      the Managers of the cinema for that  matter  had  impressed  upon  the\n      contractor appointed by them the  legal  and  safety  requirements  of\n      maintaining a safe distance between vehicles and the transformer  room\n      when they entered into a parking contract  in  the  year  1988.  This,\n      according to the Court, was gross negligence that contributed  to  the\n      death of a large number of patrons and  injuries  to  many  more.  The\n      Trial Court in support of that conclusion relied  primarily  upon  the\n      following pieces of evidence:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">           i) The sanctioned plan for the ground/stilt floor of the  Uphaar\n              Cinema building as also the report of R.N.

The  plan\n              also earmarked a  16  feet  wide  passage  to  be  maintained\n              alongside the transformer rooms for the easy  maneuvering  of\n              vehicles.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">      (ii)  The deposition of R.K.

On  the  fateful  day  parking\n           tokens had been issued for 18 cars for the matinee  show,  apart\n           from 8-10 office cars that were parked in the parking lot.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">      (iii) The deposition of K.V.

The  Court  rejected  the\n      contention that PW-29 had been tutored since he had made no mention of\n      the obstruction of smoke in the report, Ex. PW29/A.

The  Court\n      in this regard placed reliance upon Ex. PW17/D, the report prepared by\n      R.K. Gupta, Junior Engineer, MCD (PW-17) and the  deposition  of  R.S.\n      Sharma (PW-18) and  Vinod  Sharma  (PW-20).   The  Court  also  placed\n      reliance upon Ex.

PW17/DA, dated  10th\n      April, 1973, the Trial Court held that the number of seats  originally\n      sanctioned for the balcony was limited to 250 seats (two  hundred  and\n      fifty seats). The Court also noticed that the first seating  plan  Ex.\n      PW95/B1 was in conformity with the DCR, 1953 and provided a  total  of\n      three exits, one each on the two sides of the balcony and the third in\n      the middle.  Gangways leading to these exits were also found to be  in\n      conformity with the statutory requirements which prescribed a width of\n      44 inches for the same. In the year 1974, however, Sushil Ansal  (A-1)\n      made a request for installation of 14 seats  in  what  was  originally\n      sanctioned by the MCD to be an Inspection Room, pursuant  whereto  the\n      Inspection Room was converted into a 14-seater box with the permission\n      of the licensing authority. Two years later,  a  development  of  some\n      significance took place inasmuch  as  by  a  Notification  dated  30th\n      September, 1976 issued by the Lt. Governor  of  Delhi,  Uphaar  Cinema\n      permitted addition of 100 more seats to its existing  capacity.  Forty\n      three of the said additional seats were meant to be  provided  in  the\n      balcony by using the vertical gangways to  the  right  of  the  middle\n      entry/exit of the cinema  in  the  right  wing  of  the  balcony.  The\n      remaining 57 seats were meant for addition in the main  auditorium  of\n      the cinema hall. The addition of these  seats  was  approved  on  30th\n      September, 1976 as per the seating plan marked Ex. PW95/B-2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">      (2)   As per the above seating plan the  vertical  gangway  along  the\n      rightmost wall of the balcony  was  completely  utilized  and  blocked\n      because of the installation of the additional seats whereas the  width\n      of the gangway along the right  side  of  the  middle  entry/exit  was\n      reduced to 22.5  inches,  the  remainder  of  the  space  having  been\n      utilized for fixing 32 additional seats in that area. The addition  of\n      11 more seats to the row along the back  of  the  balcony  (1  on  the\n      right, 8 in the middle and 2  on  the  left  side)  made  up  for  the\n      remainder of the 43 additional seats permitted under the Notification.\n      The Trial Court found that in order to compensate for the blocking and\n      narrowing of the gangways in the right wing, the seating plan provided\n      for a 44 inch wide vertical gangway along the middle of the right wing\n      of the balcony.  Inevitably, the altered seating arrangement  made  it\n      relatively more difficult for those occupying the right  wing  of  the\n      balcony to reach the exit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">(g)   That an eight-seater family box was added in the  year  1978  upon  an\napplication moved by Gopal Ansal (A-2), which had the effect  of  completely\nclosing the right side exit, access to which already  stood  compromised  on\naccount of the additional seats.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_74\">      (1)   The above addition was made pursuant to a report given  by  S.N.\n      Dandona (A-12), since deceased, who at the relevant time was posted as\n      Executive Engineer, PWD and who appears to have inspected the site  on\n      27th June, 1978 on a reference made to him by  the  Entertainment  Tax\n      Officer. What is significant is that the Entertainment Tax Officer had\n      by his letter dated 2nd September, 1978 asked S.N. Dandona  (A-12)  to\n      confirm his report  pursuant  to  the  inspection  conducted  by  him,\n      drawing his attention to Clause 6 of the First Schedule of DCR,  1953,\n      which required that the total number of spectators accommodated in the\n      building shall not exceed 20 per 100 sq. ft. of the area available for\n      sitting and standing, or 20 per 133.5 sq. ft. of the overall  area  of\n      the floor space in the auditorium. Mr. Dandona (A-12) replied in terms\n      of his letter  dated  20th  September,  1978  Ex.  PW29/DN,  that  the\n      installation of the  eight-seater  box  was  in  accordance  with  the\n      prevalent DCR, 1953.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">      (2)   The Trial Court found fault with the installation of the  eight-\n      seater box and held that even though permission  for  installation  of\n      the box had been granted  to  the  Ansals  (A-1  and  A-2),  the  same\n      continued to be in clear violation of Para 10(4) of the First Schedule\n      to DCR, 1953 which in no uncertain terms stipulated  that  exits  from\n      the auditorium shall be placed suitably along both sides and along the\n      back thereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">(h)   That to compensate for blocking of the exit on the right of the eight-\nseater box, an exit was provided along the back  on  the  left  side.   This\naddition of an exit on the left side of the  balcony  did  not  satisfy  the\nstipulation under Para 10(4) of the First Schedule of DCR, 1953.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">      (1)   The object underlying para 10(4) of the First Schedule  of  DCR,\n      1953, observed the Trial Court, was to ensure rapid dispersal in  both\n      directions through independent stairways leading outside the building.\n      This necessarily meant that addition of the left  side  exit  did  not\n      amount to substantial compliance with  the  DCR,  1953,  declared  the\n      Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_78\">(i)   That addition of seats and closure of the right side gangway  were  in\nviolation of the statutory provisions and severely compromised the need  for\nquick dispersal in the event of an emergency.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_79\">      (1)   A further development  and  another  dimension  to  the  seating\n      arrangement in the balcony came in the form of  a  Notification  dated\n      27th July, 1979, from the Lt. Governor whereunder  the  relaxation  in\n      the  number  of  seats  provided  to  Uphaar  Cinema  under  the  1976\n      Notification was withdrawn. The withdrawal,  it  appears,  came  as  a\n      consequence of a judgment delivered by the High Court of  Delhi  in  a\n      writ petition filed by the cinema owners challenging the State’s power\n      to fix the price of admission tickets to the theatre. The power to fix\n      admission rates to the cinema having thus been  taken  away,  the  Lt.\n      Governor appears to have withdrawn the relaxation  in  the  number  of\n      additional  seats  allowed  to  the  cinema  owners  under  the   1976\n      Notification. This withdrawal was not acceptable to  the  Ansals  (A-1\n      and A-2) along with others who challenged the  same  before  the  High\n      Court of Delhi and obtained interim directions in their  favour.   The\n      High Court directed that  such  of  the  additional  seats  as  comply\n      substantially with the requirements of the Rules  may  be  allowed  to\n      stay while others which infringed the Rules may have to be removed.  A\n      show-cause notice was accordingly issued to Uphaar Cinema asking it to\n      remove all the 100 additional seats, which according to the  licensing\n      authority were non-compliant with  the  requirement  of  the  relevant\n      Rules.  Gopal Ansal (A-2) opposed the removal of these  seats  in  the\n      reply filed by him as Director of GPT Pvt. Ltd. stating that  all  the\n      additional  seats  installed  by  them   were   compliant   with   the\n      Cinematograph Rules and requested the authorities to apply their minds\n      to the direction of the High Court  regarding  substantial  compliance\n      with the Rules.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_80\">      (2)   A fresh process  of  inspection  of  the  Cinema  was  therefore\n      started, pursuant to the direction of the High  Court  and  the  show-\n      cause notice. This inspection was conducted by  Mr.  Amod  Kanth,  DCP\n      (L), S.N. Dandona, Executive Engineer, MCD (A-12) and the  Chief  Fire\n      Officer and Executive Engineer, all of  whom  had  submitted  a  joint\n      report Ex.PW29/DR.  The report, inter alia, stated that 37 of  the  43\n      additional seats in the balcony were substantially compliant with  the\n      Rules while 6 additional seats on the right side of the  balcony  were\n      in gross contravention of Paras 7(1) and 8(1) of the First Schedule to\n      DCR,  1953  as  they  were  blocking  vertical  gangways  and  causing\n      obstruction to free egress of patrons from the  balcony.  The  said  6\n      seats were, therefore, required to be removed and the original  number\n      of vertical gangways restored.  The  result  was  that  37  additional\n      seats were allowed out of 43 to stay in the balcony in terms of  order\n      dated 24th December, 1979 marked Ex. PW29/DR passed by Mr. Amod Kanth,\n      DCP (L).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">      (3)   In his letter dated 29th July, 1980, Gopal Ansal (A-2), Director\n      of GPT wrote a letter Ex. PW110/AA7 to the DCP(L) for installation  of\n      15 additional seats in the balcony. Pursuant to the said  letter,  the\n      DCP (L) wrote a letter dated 20th August, 1980 (Ex.  PW29/DS)  to  the\n      Executive Engineer, requesting him  to  verify  whether  the  proposed\n      installation  of  15  seats  would  be  compliant  with  the  relevant\n      provisions of the DCR, 1953 and to submit a detailed report  regarding\n      the same. In his reply dated 3rd September, 1980, Executive  Engineer,\n      S.N. Dandona (A-12) stated that the proposed installation of seats was\n      not in accordance with the scheme of the DCR, 1953. Gopal Ansal (A-2),\n      therefore, submitted a revised plan for the proposed additional  seats\n      vide letter dated 5th September, 1980 (Ex. PW29/DV). In his report Ex.\n      PW29/DX dated 10th September, 1980 S.N. Dandona (A-12) stated that the\n      additional 15 seats would be in conformity with DCR, 1953, but  raised\n      a concern that the installation of the 15 additional seats would bring\n      the total number of seats in the balcony to 302 while the total number\n      of exits would remain 3 in number. As per the First  Schedule  of  the\n      DCR, 1953, the number of exits should be 1 per 100 seats.  This  would\n      imply that 2 additional seats in  the  balcony  would  be  in  excess,\n      unless a fourth exit was  to  be  provided.  Having  said  that,  S.N.\n      Dandona (A-12) excused this excess on the grounds that it was  decided\n      in a meeting held in October, 1979 in which the DCP(L) and Chief  Fire\n      Officer were present that, keeping in view the High Court&#x27;s orders for\n      substantial compliance, an  excess of 1% in the number of  seats  over\n      the required number of exits  should  be  allowed.  Pursuant  to  S.N.\n      Dandona&#x27;s report, the DCP(L), Amod Kanth allowed the  installation  of\n      the 15 additional seats in the  balcony  on  4th  October,  1980.  The\n      result was that 15 additional seats were installed as per the  seating\n      plan marked Ex. PW95/B4. The Trial Court further  found  that  DCP(L),\n      Amod Kanth, S.N. Dandona (A-12),  Chief  Fire  Officer  and  Executive\n      Engineer were equally responsible for not noticing the closure of  the\n      right side exit.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">      (4)   The Trial Court found that the addition of seats as also closure\n      of the right side exit because of installation of the  family  box  in\n      that area, in the process blocking one vertical gangway, narrowing  of\n      another and partial blocking of the third (new) exit on the left  side\n      of the balcony were all in violation of the statutory  provisions  and\n      severely compromised the safety of the patrons  visiting  the  cinema.\n      The Trial Court also held that  because  of  the  alterations  in  the\n      seating plan on account of the addition of seats and blocking  of  the\n      right side exit, rapid dispersal of the patrons in  the  event  of  an\n      emergency  was  seriously  jeopardized,  which   amounted   to   gross\n      negligence on the part of the owners and management of Uphaar  Cinema,\n      as well as those who were responsible for sanctioning the changes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">      (5)   The Trial Court, in  fact,  went  a  step  further  and  ordered\n      further investigation of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/274924/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 173(8)</a> of the  CrPC\n      vis-a-vis the persons left out by the CBI,  particularly  the  DCP(L),\n      Amod Kanth against whom the Association of Victims of  Uphaar  Tragedy\n      had filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 319</a>  of  the  CrPC.  The  Trial\n      Court held that the balcony seating plans showed that the  authorities\n      responsible for  the  enforcement  of  the  Rules  as  well  as  their\n      subordinates who were to carry out inspections were in connivance with\n      the proprietors of the cinema, Sushil and Gopal Ansal  (A-1  and  A-2)\n      who acted in connivance with each other  with  a  view  to  making  an\n      unlawful gain at the cost of the public.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_84\">(j)   That the owners of  Uphaar  Cinema  who  carried  out  the  structural\ndeviations, the officers of the MCD who granted &#x27;No Objection’  certificates\nfor running the cinema hall for the years 1995-96 and  1996-97  respectively\ndespite the structural deviations existing in the cinema  building  and  the\nmanagers of Uphaar Cinema who turned a blind eye to the said deviations  and\nthe threat to public safety caused by them, were the direct cause  of  death\nof 59 persons and 100 injured in the cinema hall. The act of the  gatekeeper\nin fleeing from the cinema hall without unbolting the door  of  balcony  was\nalso found to be a direct cause of the death of persons inside the balcony.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">      (1)   As regards the unfolding of events  in  the  balcony  after  the\n      smoke began  to  spread  inside,  the  Trial  Court  relied  upon  the\n      depositions of patrons seated in the balcony, PWs 1, 3, 7, 8, 11 &amp;  12\n      who were fortunate to survive the ordeal, but all of whom had lost  in\n      the tragedy some of their relatives who accompanied them to the movie.\n      The Trial Court also relied  upon  the  depositions  of  relatives  of\n      deceased patrons from the balcony, examined as PWs 4, 5, 6, 9, 10,  13\n      &amp; 66, who were not among those in the cinema hall themselves  but  who\n      had rushed  to  the  scene  upon  learning  about  the  disaster.  The\n      deposition of the complainant Security Guard, Sudhir Kumar (PW63)  who\n      first noticed the fire and helped in rescue operations was also relied\n      upon. Relying upon the above evidence, the Trial Court arrived at  the\n      following conclusions:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">           i) Since the patrons were trapped inside the balcony  which  was\n              engulfed by the  smoke,  those  who  succumbed  died  due  to\n              inhalation of smoke.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">          ii) The patrons  seated  in  the  balcony  were  unable  to  save\n              themselves in time  since  there  were  no  proper  means  of\n              escape.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">         iii) Though four exits were statutorily required in  the  balcony,\n              only three were provided.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">          iv) As previously held, the alterations made to  the  balcony  by\n              the  owners  of  Uphaar  Cinema  in  contravention  of  legal\n              provisions became a hindrance to egress into the open air for\n              patrons in the balcony, as a result of which the said patrons\n              could not save themselves in time.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">           v) Three exit doors were bolted. After  becoming  aware  of  the\n              fire in the building, the gatekeeper, Manmohan  Uniyal  (A-8)\n              fled the scene without unbolting the exit doors.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">          vi) Since the doors had been bolted, one of the doors had  to  be\n              pushed open by the trapped patrons in order to come out  into\n              open space. This endeavour took 10-15 minutes, which resulted\n              in a sufficient amount of exposure  to  the  toxic  gases  to\n              cause the death of the persons inhaling the same.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">         vii) Moreover, since descending the staircase would only take  the\n              patrons into denser smoke, people attempted to climb  upwards\n              towards the terrace. However, their path was  obstructed  due\n              to the unauthorised construction of the commercial office  of\n              M/s Sareen Associates on the landing of the staircase on  the\n              top floor, which created  a  bottleneck  and  facilitated  in\n              causing the death of  more  patrons.  Moreover,  one  of  the\n              structural deviations previously noted by the Trial Court was\n              the presence of a full width door on the right  side  of  the\n              stair case  landing  on  the  top  floor,  which  created  an\n              obstruction for going to the terrace.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">        viii) It is revealed from the  inspection  reports  that  the  four\n              exhaust fans which were to face an open space instead  opened\n              out into the staircase.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">          ix) As previously held, the existing structural deviations in the\n              building obstructed the egress of patrons  into  open  spaces\n              and thereby  directly  contributed  to  their  deaths.  These\n              blatant structural deviations were never objected to  by  the\n              MCD, a government body  which  is  responsible  for  ensuring\n              compliance with building plans.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">           x) The eye-witnesses have unanimously  deposed  that  once  they\n              realized that smoke was entering the hall and a hue  and  cry\n              was raised, no one from the management of the cinema  theatre\n              was there to help them escape. Instead, the managers fled the\n              scene without thought for the patrons.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">          xi) There were no fire alarms or emergency lighting, nor was  any\n              public announcement made to warn the patrons of the fire.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">         xii) As per the deposition of  the  Projector  Operator,  Madhukar\n              Bagde (PW85), an  announcement  system  was  present  in  the\n              Projector Room but the same was out of order. He deposed that\n              he  had  previously  informed  K.L.  Malhotra  (A-4),   since\n              deceased, to have the same  rectified.  This  fact  was  also\n              verified in the report of PW64, Dr. Rajinder Singh.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">        xiii)  The  managers  being  directly  responsible  for  the  daily\n              functioning of the cinema failed in their duty to ensure  the\n              safety of the patrons seated inside. They  grossly  neglected\n              their duties to take measures to  prevent  fires  and  follow\n              fire safety regulations, which caused the  death  of  patrons\n              trapped inside.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">         xiv) It  is  writ  large  that  the  failure  of  the  owners  and\n              management of Uphaar Cinema to adhere to provisions  relating\n              to fire safety caused the death/injury of those who had  gone\n              to view the film in the cinema.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">          xv) The factors which constituted the direct and proximate  cause\n              of death of 59 persons and injury of 100  persons  in  Uphaar\n              cinema were  the  installation  of  the  DVB  transformer  in\n              violation of law,  faulty  repair  of  the  DVB  transformer,\n              presence of combustible  material  in  the  cinema  building,\n              parking of cars near the transformer room, alterations in the\n              balcony obstructing egress, structural  deviations  resulting\n              in closure of escape routes in the building at  the  time  of\n              the incident, bolting of the exit doors from outside and  the\n              absence of fire fighting measures and  two  trained  firemen,\n              during the exhibition of the film in the cinema building.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">(k)   That the cause of death of the  59  victims  was  asphyxia  caused  by\nprolonged inhalation of smoke consisting of carbon monoxide and other  toxic\ngases.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">      (1)   On the basis of the result of the post-mortem examination on the\n      dead body of Captain M.S. Bhinder, the Trial Court held that  all  the\n      victims died on account of the very same cause  as  was  found  to  be\n      responsible for the demise  of  Captain  Bhinder.  Reliance  was  also\n      placed by the Trial Court upon the reports submitted  by  a  Board  of\n      Medical Experts from AIIMS which proposed that the death of 59 victims\n      of asphyxia was caused due to inhalation of smoke consisting of carbon\n      monoxide and other toxic gases. On the basis of  the  expert  opinion,\n      the Court concluded that the cause of death of the persons sitting  in\n      the balcony was due to inhalation of smoke. The Court noted  that  the\n      effect of gases is rapid as the fatal period for carbon monoxide  with\n      10% concentration is within 20-30 minutes while the  fatal  period  of\n      hydrocyanic acid is 2-20 minutes. The combustion of materials released\n      such toxic compounds, which in turn caused rapid death of the victims.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">      The Court also held that  immediate  well-organized  intensive  rescue\n      operations could have saved many lives.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_87\">28.   In conclusion and on the basis of the findings  recorded  by  it,  the\nTrial  Court  convicted  Sushil  Ansal  (A-1)  and  Gopal  Ansal  (A-2)  for\ncommission of the offences punishable under Sections 304A, 337 and 338  read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 36</a> of IPC and sentenced each one of them  to  undergo  rigorous\nimprisonment for a period of two years with  a  fine  of  Rs.5,000/-  and  a\ndefault sentence of six months. They were also convicted  under  <a href=\"/doc/1107870/\" id=\"a_18\">Section  14</a>\nof the Cinematograph Act, 1952 and sentenced to pay a fine of Rs.1,000/-  or\nundergo two months imprisonment in default. All the sentences were  directed\nto run concurrently. The Trial Court further convicted  S.S.  Sharma  (A-13)\nand N.D. Tiwari (A-14) who were officials of the  Municipal  Corporation  of\nDelhi apart from H.S. Panwar (A-15), Divisional Officer, Delhi Fire  Service\nunder the above provisions and  sentenced  them  similarly  to  undergo  two\nyears rigorous  imprisonment  and  a  fine  of  Rs.5,000/-  besides  default\nsentence of six months imprisonment. In addition, the Trial Court found  the\ncharges framed against the Managers of GPT, namely, R.K. Sharma (A-5),  N.S.\nChopra  (A-6)  and  Assistant  Manager  Ajit  Choudhary  (A-7)  as  well  as\ngatekeeper Manmohan Uniyal (A-8) under Section 304 read with <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 36</a>  IPC\nproved and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a  period  of\nseven years with a fine of Rs.5,000/- and a default sentence of six  months.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_88\">29.   B.M. Satija (A-9)  and  A.K.  Gera  (A-10)  who  happened  to  be  DVB\nInspectors at the relevant point of time and Bir Singh (A-11)  who  happened\nto be DVB Senior Fitter were similarly  convicted  under  Section  304  read\nwith  <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_20\">Section  36</a>  IPC  and  sentenced  to  undergo  seven  years   rigorous\nimprisonment besides a fine of Rs.5,000/- and  a  default  sentence  of  six\nmonths imprisonment.  Proceedings against R.M. Puri (A-3), Director  of  GPT\nand  K.L.  Malhotra  (A-4)  Deputy  General  Manager,  S.N.  Dandona  (A-12)\nExecutive Engineer, PWD and Surender  Dutt  (A-16)  Station  Officer,  Delhi\nFire Service, all of whom died during the pendency of the trial,  were  held\nto  have  abated.  Not  only  that,  the  Trial   Court   directed   further\ninvestigation into the matter under <a href=\"/doc/274924/\" id=\"a_21\">Section  173(8)</a>  Cr.P.C.  in  regard  to\nother persons including  Amod  Kanth  DCP(L)  for  allowing  the  cinema  to\nfunction on temporary permits and for not demanding the detailed  inspection\nreports before issuing such permits.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_89\">Findings of the High Court:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_90\">30.   Aggrieved by the judgment and order passed against them,  all  the  12\naccused persons convicted by the Trial Court preferred  appeals  before  the\nDelhi High Court. The Association of Victims of Uphaar Tragedy also filed  a\nrevision petition challenging the judgment and order of the Trial  Court  to\nthe extent  the  same  convicted  the  accused  persons  only  for  offences\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 304A</a> IPC instead of Section 304, Part II  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_23\">IPC</a>.  The\nHigh Court, as noticed in the beginning  of  this  order,  disposed  of  the\naforementioned appeal  by  a  common  judgment  dated  19th  December,  2008\nwhereby the High Court affirmed the findings of fact recorded by  the  Trial\nCourt.  We may at this stage briefly refer to  the  said  findings  for  the\nsake of clarity.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_91\">I     Re: Ownership, Management and Control of Uphaar Cinema:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">(i)     In  para  9.68  of  its  judgment  the  High  Court  held  that  the\nownership, management and control of Uphaar Cinema  vested  with  the  Ansal\nbrothers (A-1 and A-2) at all material times.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">(ii)  In para 9.62 of its judgment the  High  Court  affirmed  the  findings\nrecorded by the Trial Court and held that Ansal brothers (A-1 and A-2)  were\nresponsible for all major decisions in regard to management and  affairs  of\nthe Uphaar Cinema such as:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">      (a)   The decision regarding installation of  DVB  transformer  within\n      the cinema premises.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">      (b)   The decision relating to re-arrangement of seating plan  in  the\n      balcony which was in violation of DCR, 1953 and DCR, 1981.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">      (c)     The  decision  regarding  closure  of  right  side   exit   by\n      installation of eight-seater family box.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">      (d)   The decision regarding placement  of  additional  seats  in  the\n      balcony.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">      (e)   The grant of contracts for use of parking space.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">      (f)   The exercise of unlimited financial  powers  on  behalf  of  the\n      company and the power to create  encumbrances  and  charges  over  its\n      assets.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">      (g)   The decision relating to commercial use of the building.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">      (h)   The decisions concerning day-to-day affairs of the company.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">(iii) In paras 9.63 and 9.64 the High Court held that the Ansals (A-1 and A-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">2) were not only the Directors of  the  company  but  had  continued  to  be\ninvolved in its day-to-day functioning even after they ceased to be so.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">(iv)  The High Court further held that merely because the letter  dated  6th\nMarch, 1997 had presented R.M. Puri and K.L. Malhotra (both since  deceased)\nas authorised signatories of the company for operating the  cinema  and  for\ndealing  with  the  licensing  authority  did  not  mean  that  a   specific\nnomination in their favour was made in terms of Rule 10(2) of DCR,  1953  or\nthe corresponding provision under DCR, 1981.  The High Court held  that  the\nshareholding pattern of the  company  revealed  that  the  major/predominant\nshareholding continued to remain with the Ansal family and at  no  point  of\ntime was any outsider shown to have held any of the 5000  shares  issued  by\nthe company.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">(v)   In para 9.67 of its  judgment  the  High  Court  held  that  from  the\ndeposition of those shown to be the Directors of the  company  in  the  year\n1996 to 1997, it is evident that  even  though  they  had  attended  certain\nmeetings of the Board, they were completely unaware  of  the  vital  aspects\nincluding the fact that Uphaar Cinema was being run by  Ansal  Theatres  and\nClubotels Pvt. Ltd. and whether they were in fact Directors or empowered  to\nact on behalf of the company.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">II    Re: DVB Transformer:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">(i)   In para 7.4 the High Court held that  the  DVB  transformer  had  been\ninstalled against the provision of the Electricity Rules.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">(ii)  In paras 7.10 and 7.12 of its judgment the  High  Court  rejected  the\nsubmission made on behalf of Sushil Ansal (A-1) and Gopal Ansal  (A-2)  that\nthey were coerced in providing space for the DVB transformer.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">(iii) In paras 7.94, 7.95 and 7.96 of its judgment the High  Court  affirmed\nthe findings recorded by the Trial Court that the  DVB  transformer  was  in\npoor maintenance on the date of the incident on account of the following:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">        A)  Protection  relays  which  could  have  tripped  off  the   DVB\n           transformer were missing.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">        B) The LT side cables from the bus bar did not have clamping system\n           or support to the cables.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">        C) The earth cable was in a twisted condition; and\n\n        D)  The Buchholtz relay system was not fitted on the transformer.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_92\">31.   The High Court comprehensively  dealt  with  the  cause  of  fire  and\naffirmed the findings recorded by the Trial Court that the fire had  started\nfrom the DVB transformer on account of the improper repair  carried  out  on\nthe same without use of a crimping machine because of  which  the  LT  cable\nhad got disconnected on the B-phase  and  an  opening  was  created  on  the\nradiator fin when the live cable fell upon it and caused  a  short  circuit.\nThe High Court summed up the cause of the fire in paras 7.124 and  7.125  of\nits judgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_93\">32.    The  High  Court  held  that  the  correspondence  relating  to   the\ninstallation of the DVB transformer did not suggest any  element  of  threat\nor use of force or economic power on the part of the DVB. On  the  contrary,\nthe correspondence revealed an anxiety on the part of cinema  management  to\nstart its operation.  It also held in paras 7.10 and 7.11  of  its  judgment\nthat the Uphaar establishment was  a  beneficiary  of  the  DVB  transformer\nsince some parts of the building which  were  let  out  to  tenants  of  the\nestablishment were receiving electricity supply from the  said  transformer.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_94\">III   Re: Car Parking:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\">33.   In para 7.17 of its judgment the  High  Court  affirmed  the  findings\nrecorded by the Trial Court that the parking of extra cars and  the  parking\nof cars close to the transformer room  blocking  the  16  ft.  wide  passage\nwhich was meant to be kept free for the  movement  of  vehicles,  aggravated\nthe fire and contributed to the incident.  The  High  Court  held  that  the\nowners and the management of Uphaar Cinema  had  blatantly  disregarded  the\nrequirements of law and the sanctioned plan thereby  putting  the  lives  of\nits patrons at risk. The High Court further held that  Ansal  brothers  (A-1\nand A-2) or the Managers had not conveyed  to  the  parking  contractor  the\nlegal and safety requirement of maintaining  a  safe  distance  between  the\nvehicles and the transformer room while entering into a parking contract  in\nthe year 1988 nor was the parking arrangement subject to any kind of  check.\n The outsourcing of the car  parking  did  not,  observed  the  High  Court,\nabsolve the cinema management which  was  the  occupier  and  owner  of  the\npremises of their duty to ensure that vehicles parked immediately below  the\nviewing area were maintained keeping all safety standards in mind.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_96\">IV    Re: Structural Deviations:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\">34.   In paras 7.39 to 7.60 of its judgment  the  High  Court  affirmed  the\nfindings recorded by the Trial  Court  that  several  structural  deviations\napart from violation in the balcony had been committed by the management  of\nthe cinema hall.  The High  Court  held  that  construction  of  refreshment\ncounters on the first floor of the cinema hall  inhibited  free  passage  of\nthe patrons which was crucial in the event of an emergency and  amounted  to\nviolation of para 10(1) of the First Schedule of DCR, 1953  and  were  hence\nin breach of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1107870/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 14</a> of the Cinematograph Act  and  the\nlicence issued thereunder.  Similarly, the exhaust fans were so placed  that\nthey opened into the hall of the front staircase instead of opening into  an\nopen space. The structural deviations, according to the High Court,  assumed\nan incrementally risky character which the cinema  occupier  was  aware  of.\nSimilarly, the other violations referred to by the High Court including  the\nstorage and use of combustible materials and closing of one  of  the  exits,\nbesides shifting of the gangway contributed  to  violations  that  prevented\nquick dispersal of the patrons from the balcony area thereby culminating  in\nthe tragedy.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_98\">V     Re: Seating arrangement in the balcony:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_99\">35.   The High Court dealt with blocking of the right side exit  by  placing\nan 8-seater family box, addition of seats on the left side  of  the  balcony\nthat prevented quick dispersal of  the  patrons,  providing  gangways  which\nwere less than the required width and fixing of seats obstructing  the  left\nside (new) exit all of which contributed  to  a  situation  from  which  the\nvictims could not escape to save their lives. The High  Court  further  held\nthat  blocking  of  the  right  side  exit  by  the  8-seater  box  rendered\nineffective the mandate of para 9(1),  DCR,  1953  which  required  that  at\nleast two stairways be provided for public use each  not  less  than  4  ft.\nwide.  Each one of these deviations had, according to the  High  Court,  the\neffect of substantially increasing the risk to a point  where  an  emergency\nrequiring  rapid  egress  from  the  balcony  area  could  not   have   been\neffectively handled to save human lives.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\">36.

Thus the principles governing interference by this Court  in\n           a criminal appeal by special leave may be summarised as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">               (1)   that   this   Court   would    not    interfere    with\n               the concurrent finding of fact based on pure appreciation  of\n               evidence even if it were to take  a  different  view  on  the\n               evidence;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">               (2)  that  the  Court  will  not  normally   enter   into   a\n               reappraisement  or  review  of  the  evidence,   unless   the\n               assessment of the High Court is vitiated by an error  of  law\n               or procedure or is based on error of  record,  misreading  of\n               evidence or is inconsistent with the evidence, for  instance,\n               where the ocular evidence is totally  inconsistent  with  the\n               medical evidence and so on;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">               (3) that the Court would not enter into  credibility  of  the\n               evidence with a view to substitute its own opinion  for  that\n               of the High Court;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">               (4) that the Court would interfere where the High  Court  has\n               arrived at a  finding  of fact in  disregard  of  a  judicial\n               process, principles of natural justice or a fair  hearing  or\n               has acted in violation of a mandatory  provision  of  law  or\n               procedure resulting in serious prejudice or injustice to  the\n               accused;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1922173\" id=\"span_2\">(5)  this  Court  might   also   interfere   where   on   the\n               proved facts wrong inferences of law have been drawn or where\n               the conclusions of the High Court are manifestly perverse and\n               based on no evidence: It is very difficult to lay down a rule\n               of universal application but the principles  mentioned  above\n               and those adumbrated in the authorities of this  Court  cited\n               supra provide sufficient guidelines for this Court to  decide\n               criminal appeals by special leave. Thus in a criminal  appeal\n               by special leave, this Court  at  the  hearing  examines  the\n               evidence and the judgment of the High Court with the  limited\n               purpose of determining whether or  not  the  High  Court  has\n               followed the principles enunciated  above.

This Court cautioned that it was  necessary  to\nbear in mind the limited scope of the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 136</a>  of  the\nConstitution which cannot be converted into a  third  appeal  on  facts  and\nthat mere errors  are  not  enough  to  attract  this  Court’s  invigilatory\njurisdiction.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1993365\" id=\"span_6\">A  similar  view  was  expressed  by  this  Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/1993365/\" id=\"a_41\">Amitava\nBanerjee v. State of West Bengal</a> (2011) 12 SCC 554 and Mohd. Arif  v.

Suffice it to say that this Court is not an ordinary Court  of  appeal\nobliged  to  reappraise  the  evidence  and  record  its   conclusion.   The\njurisdiction to interfere under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 136</a> is extraordinary and  the  power\nvested in this Court is not exercised to upset concurrent findings  of  fact\nrecorded by the two Courts below on a proper appreciation  of  evidence.  It\nis only in those rare  and  exceptional  cases  where  the  appreciation  of\nevidence is found to be wholly unsatisfactory or the conclusion  drawn  from\nthe same perverse in nature, causing miscarriage of justice that this  Court\nmay correct the course of justice and undo  the  wrong.  Perversity  in  the\nfindings, illegality or irregularity in the trial that results in  injustice\nor failure to take into consideration an important  piece  of  evidence  are\nsome of the situations in which  this  Court  may  reappraise  the  evidence\nadduced at the trial but not otherwise. The scope of interference  with  the\nfindings of fact concurrently  found  by  the  Trial  Court  and  the  First\nAppellate Court is thus permissible as  a  rarity  only  in  the  situations\nenumerated above and not as a matter of course or for mere asking.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_121\">(ii)  ‘Rash’ or ‘Negligent’ – Meaning of:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_122\">47.   <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 304A</a> of the IPC makes any act  causing  death  by  a  rash  or\nnegligent  act  not  amounting  to  culpable   homicide,   punishable   with\nimprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to two  years\nor with fine or with both.  It reads:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">           “304A. Causing death by negligence.-- Whoever causes  the  death\n           of any person by doing any rash or negligent act  not  amounting\n           to culpable homicide shall  be  punished  with  imprisonment  of\n           either description for a term which may extend to two years,  or\n           with fine, or with both.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_123\">48.   The terms ‘rash’ or ‘negligent’ appearing in  Section  304A  extracted\nabove have not been defined in the Code.  Judicial pronouncements  have  all\nthe same given a meaning which has been long accepted as  the  true  purport\nof the two expressions appearing in the provisions. One of the  earliest  of\nthese pronouncements was in Empress of India v. Idu Beg  ILR  (1881)  3  All\n776, where Straight J. explained that  in  the  case  of  a  rash  act,  the\ncriminality lies in running the risk of doing an act  with  recklessness  or\nindifference as to consequences.  A similar meaning was given  to  the  term\n‘rash’ by the High Court of Madras in  In Re: Nidamarti Negaghushanam 7  Mad\nHCR 119, where the Court held that culpable rashness meant acting  with  the\nconsciousness that a mischievous and illegal  consequence  may  follow,  but\nhoping that it will not. Culpability in the case of rashness arises  out  of\nthe person concerned acting despite the consciousness. These meanings  given\nto the expression ‘rash’, have broadly met the approval of this  Court  also\nas is evident from a conspectus of decisions delivered from  time  to  time,\nto which we shall presently advert.  But before we do so, we  may  refer  to\nthe  following  passage  from  “A  Textbook  of  Jurisprudence”  by   George\nWhitecross Paton reliance whereupon was placed by Mr. Jethmalani in  support\nof his submission. Rashness  according  to  Paton  means  “where  the  actor\nforesees possible consequences, but foolishly thinks they will not occur  as\na result of his act”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_124\">49.   In the case of ‘negligence’ the Courts have favoured a  meaning  which\nimplies a gross and culpable neglect or failure to exercise that  reasonable\nand proper care and precaution to guard against injury either to the  public\ngenerally or to an individual which having regard to all  the  circumstances\nout of which the charge arises,  it  may  be  the  imperative  duty  of  the\naccused to have adopted.  Negligence has been understood to be  an  omission\nto do something which a reasonable  man  guided  upon  those  considerations\nwhich ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs, would do,  or  doing\nsomething which a  prudent  and  reasonable  person  would  not  do.  Unlike\nrashness,  where  the  imputability   arises   from   acting   despite   the\nconsciousness, negligence implies acting without such consciousness, but  in\ncircumstances which show that  the  actor  has  not  exercised  the  caution\nincumbent upon him.  The imputability in the case of negligence arises  from\nthe neglect of the civil duty of circumspection.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_125\">(iii) What constitutes Negligence?:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">50.   The expression ‘negligence’ has also not been  defined  in  the  Penal\nCode, but, that has not deterred  the  Courts  from  giving  what  has  been\nwidely acknowledged as a reasonably acceptable meaning to the term.  We  may\nbefore referring to the judicial pronouncements on the subject refer to  the\ndictionary meaning of the term ‘negligence’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">51.   Black’s Law Dictionary defines negligence as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">           “The failure to exercise the standard of care that a  reasonably\n           prudent person would have exercised in a similar situation;  any\n           conduct that falls  below  the  legal  standard  established  to\n           protect others against unreasonable risk  of  harm,  except  for\n           conduct  that   is   intentionally,   wantonly,   or   willfully\n           disregardful of other’s rights.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">52.   Charlesworth and Percy on Negligence  (Twelfth  Edition)  gives  three\nmeanings to negligence in forensic speech viz: (i) in referring to  a  state\nof mind, when it is distinguished in  particular  from  intention;  (ii)  in\ndescribing conduct of a careless type; and (iii) as the breach of a duty  to\ntake care imposed by either common law or statute.  The three  meanings  are\nthen explained thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">           “The first  meaning:  Negligence  as  a  state  of  mind  can  be\n           contrasted with intention.  An act  is  intentional  when  it  is\n           purposeful and done with the desire  or  object  of  producing  a\n           particular result.  In contrast, negligence in the present  sense\n           arises  where  someone  either  fails  to  consider  a  risk   of\n           particular action, or having considered it,  fails  to  give  the\n           risk appropriate weight.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">           The second meaning: Negligence can also  be  used  as  a  way  to\n           characterize conduct, although such a use may lead to imprecision\n           when considering negligence as a tort.  Careless conduct does not\n           necessarily give rise to breach of a duty of care,  the  defining\n           characteristic of the tort of negligence.  The extent of  a  duty\n           of care and the standard of care required in performance of  that\n           duty are both relevant in considering whether, on any given facts\n           conduct which can be characterized as careless, is actionable  in\n           law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">           “The third meaning: The third meaning of negligence, and the  one\n           with which this  volume  is  principally  concerned,  is  conduct\n           which, objectively considered, amounts to breach  of  a  duty  to\n           take care”.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">53.

Law of Torts by Rattanlal &amp;  Dhirajlal,  explains  negligence  in  the\nfollowing words:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">           “Negligence is the breach of a duty caused by the omission to do\n           something which a reasonable man, guided by those considerations\n           which ordinarily regulate the conduct of human affairs would do,\n           or doing something which a prudent and reasonable man would  not\n           do.  Actionable negligence consists in the neglect of the use of\n           ordinary care or skill towards a person to  whom  the  defendant\n           owes the duty of observing ordinary care  and  skill,  by  which\n           neglect the plaintiff has  suffered  injury  to  his  person  or\n           property.  According to Winfield, “negligence as a tort  is  the\n           breach of a legal duty to take care  which  results  in  damage,\n           undesired by the defendant to the  plaintiff”.   The  definition\n           involves three constituents of negligence: (1) A legal  duty  to\n           exercise due care on the part of the party complained of towards\n           the party complaining the former’s conduct within the  scope  of\n           the duty; (2) Breach of the said  duty;  and  (3)  consequential\n           damage. Cause of action for negligence arises only  when  damage\n           occurs for damage is a necessary ingredient of this  tort.   But\n           as  damage  may  occur  before  it  is  discovered;  it  is  the\n           occurrence of damage which is the starting point of the cause of\n           action.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_131\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"871062\" id=\"span_7\">55.

Union  of  India  and\nOrs.</a>, (2001) 1 ILR Punjab &amp; Haryana 368 to which one of us (Thakur  J.)  was\na party, the High Court of Punjab &amp; Haryana held that both  the  school,  as\nwell as the owners of a premises on which  the  school  function  was  held,\nwere liable as occupiers for the tragic death of 406 persons, most  of  them\nchildren, caused by a fire which  broke  out  on  the  premises  during  the\nfunction. In dealing with the question whether the owners of  the  premises,\nRajiv  Marriage  Palace,  being  agents  of  the  school   could   be   held\naccountable, the High Court held as follows:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">           “..The School ought to have known that in a  function  which  is\n           open to general public, a Pandal with a capacity of 500  to  600\n           persons spread over no more than an area measuring 100’ x 70’, a\n           gathering of 1200 to 1500 persons could result in a stampede and\n           expose to harm everyone participating in the function especially\n           the children who were otherwise  incapable  of  taking  care  of\n           their  safety.   The  school  ought  to  have  known  that   the\n           availability of only one exit gate from the Marriage Palace  and\n           one from the Pandal would prove insufficient in the event  ofany\n           untoward incident taking place in the course of  function.   The\n           School ought to have  taken  care  to  restrict  the  number  of\n           invitees to what could be  reasonably  accommodated  instead  of\n           allowing all and sundry to attend and in  the  process  increase\n           the chances of a stampede.  The School ought to have  seen  that\n           sufficient circulation space in and around the seating area  was\n           provided so that the people could quickly move out of the  place\n           in case the need so arose.  Suffice it to say that a  reasonably\n           prudent School Management organizing an  annual  function  could\n           and indeed was duty bound to take care and ensure that  no  harm\n           came to anyone who attended the function whether as  an  invitee\n           or otherwise, by taking appropriate steps to provide for  safety\n           measures like fire fighting arrangements, exit points, space for\n           circulation, crowd control and the like.   And  that  obligation\n           remained unmitigated regardless whether the  function  was  held\n           within the School premises or at another  place  chosen  by  the\n           Management of the School, because the children continued  to  be\n           under the care of the School and so did the  obligation  of  the\n           School to prevent any harm coming to  them.   The  principle  of\n           proximity creating an obligation for the School qua its students\n           and invitees to the function would make the  School  liable  for\n           any negligence in either the choice of the venue of the function\n           or the degree of care that ought to  have been taken to  prevent\n           any  harm  coming  to  those  who  had  come  to  watch   and/or\n           participate in the event. Even the test of foreseeability of the\n           harm must be held to have been satisfied from the point of  view\n           of an ordinary and reasonably prudent person. That is because  a\n           reasonably  prudent  person  could  foresee  danger   to   those\n           attending a function in a place big enough to  accommodate  only\n           500  to  600  people  but  stretched  beyond  its  capacity   to\n           accommodate double that number.  It could also be foreseen  that\n           there was hardly any space for circulation  within  the  Pandal.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_137\">           In the event of any mishap, a stampede was inevitable  in  which\n           women and children who were attending in large number  would  be\n           worst sufferers as indeed they turned out to be. Loose  electric\n           connections, crude lighting arrangements and  an  electric  load\n           heavier than what the entire system was geared  to  take  was  a\n           recipe for a human  tragedy  to  occur.   Absence  of  any  fire\n           extinguishing arrangements within the Pandal and a  single  exit\n           from the Pandal hardly enough for the people to run out  in  the\n           event of fire could have put any prudent person handling such an\n           event to serious thought about the safety of those attending the\n           functioning especially the small children who had  been  brought\n           to the venue in large numbers…”\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">64.

The cause of the carbon monoxide  was  the  blocking  of\nthe chimney in the room of the lodger, as well as in the  neighbouring  room\ndue to which the smoke from a fire in  the  room  could  not  escape.

They were led to believe  that  the  appellant  and  his\n           father would take care that they were not poisoned by equipments\n           provided  by  the  family.  The  appellant  was   possessed   of\n           sufficient information to make him aware of a  danger  of  death\n           from gas. He may not have had sufficient skill  to  be  able  to\n           discover how that danger arose but he was responsible for taking\n           reasonable steps to deal with that danger if need by calling  in\n           expert help. In those circumstances the judge was right to  hold\n           that there was a sufficient proximity between the lodgers on the\n           one side and the father and son on the other  side  to  place  a\n           duty of care on the latter.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">66.   To sum up, negligence signifies the breach of a duty to  do  something\nwhich a reasonably prudent man would under the circumstances  have  done  or\ndoing something which when judged from reasonably prudent  standards  should\nnot have been done. The essence of negligence whether arising  from  an  act\nof commission or omission lies in neglect of care towards a person  to  whom\nthe defendant or the accused as the case may be  owes  a  duty  of  care  to\nprevent damage or injury to the property or the person of  the  victim.  The\nexistence of a duty to care is  thus  the  first  and  most  fundamental  of\ningredients in any  civil  or  criminal  action  brought  on  the  basis  of\nnegligence, breach of such duty  and  consequences  flowing  from  the  same\nbeing the other two.  It follows that in  any  forensic  exercise  aimed  at\nfinding  out  whether  there  was   any  negligence  on  the  part  of   the\ndefendant/accused, the Courts will have to address the above  three  aspects\nto find a correct answer to the charge.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">(iv)  Difference between  negligence  in  civil  actions  and   in  criminal\n      cases:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_121\">67.   Conceptually the basis for negligence in civil law is  different  from\nthat in criminal law, only in  the  degree  of  negligence  required  to  be\nproved in a criminal action than what  is  required  to  be  proved  by  the\nplaintiff in a  civil  action  for  recovery  of  damages.  For  an  act  of\nnegligence to be culpable in criminal law, the  degree  of  such  negligence\nmust be higher than what is sufficient to prove a case of  negligence  in  a\ncivil action. Judicial  pronouncements  have  repeatedly  declared  that  in\norder to constitute an offence, negligence must be gross  in  nature.   That\nproposition was argued by Mr. Ram Jethmalani at great  length  relying  upon\nEnglish decisions apart from those from this Court and the  High  Courts  in\nthe country.  In fairness to Mr. Salve, counsel appearing for  the  CBI  and\nMr. Tulsi appearing for the Association of Victims,  we  must  mention  that\nthe legal proposition propounded by Mr. Jethmalani was not disputed  and  in\nour  opinion  rightly  so.  That  negligence  can  constitute   an   offence\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 304A</a> of the IPC only if the same is  proved  to  be\ngross, no matter the word “gross” has not been used  by  the  Parliament  in\nthat provision is the settled legal position. It is, therefore,  unnecessary\nfor us to trace the development of law  on  the  subject,  except  making  a\nbrief reference to a few notable decisions which were  referred  to  at  the\nbar.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_122\">68.   One of the earliest decisions which examined the question of  criminal\nnegligence in England was R. v.

The allegation against  the  doctor\nwas that he had negligently prepared too strong a mixture  and  thereby  was\nguilty of manslaughter on account  of  criminal  negligence.

Both statements are true and perhaps cannot safely be  made\n           more definite, but it must be  remembered  that  the  degree  of\n           negligence required is that it should be gross, and that neither\n           a jury nor a Court can transform negligence of a  lesser  degree\n           into gross negligence merely by giving it that appellation.  The\n           further words spoken by the Lord Chief Justice in the same  case\n           are, in their Lordships&#x27; opinion, at least as important as those\n           which have been set out:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">           It is desirable that, as far as  possible,  the  explanation  of\n           criminal negligence to a jury should not be a mere  question  of\n           epithets. It is, in a sense, a question of degree, and it is for\n           the jury to draw the line, but there is  a  difference  in  kind\n           between the negligence which gives a right to  compensation  and\n           the negligence which is a crime.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_127\"> 70.  What is important is that the Privy  Council  clearly  recognized  the\ndifficulty besetting any attempt to define culpable or  criminal  negligence\nand  held  that  it  was  not  possible  to  make  the  distinction  between\nactionable  and  criminal  negligence  intelligible,  except  by  means   of\nillustrations drawn from actual judicial opinions.  On  the  facts  of  that\ncase the Privy Council accepted the view that merely  because  a  number  of\npersons had  taken  gravely  ill  after  receiving  an  injection  from  the\naccused, a criminal degree of negligence was not proved.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_128\">71.   In Jacob Mathew’s case (supra) a three-Judge Bench of this  Court  was\nexamining a case of criminal medical negligence by a  doctor  under  <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_48\">Section\n304A</a> IPC. This Court reviewed the decisions on  the  subject  including  the\ndecision of the Privy Council in John Oni Akerele’s case (supra) to  sum  up\nits conclusions in para 48. For the case at hand conclusions 5  and  6  bear\nrelevance which may, therefore, be extracted:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_129\">           “48.

What may be negligence in civil  law  may  not\n           necessarily be negligence in criminal  law.  For  negligence  to\n           amount to an offence, the element of mens rea must be  shown  to\n           exist. For an act to amount to criminal negligence,  the  degree\n           of negligence should be much higher i.e. gross or of a very high\n           degree. Negligence which is neither gross nor of a higher degree\n           may provide a ground for action in civil law but cannot form the\n           basis for prosecution.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_131\">                 (6) The word “gross” has not been  used  in  <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_49\">Section  304-A</a>\n           IPC, yet it is  settled  that  in  criminal  law  negligence  or\n           recklessness, to be so held, must be of such a high degree as to\n           be “gross”. The expression “rash or negligent act” as  occurring\n           in <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 304-A</a> IPC has to be read as  qualified  by  the  word\n           “grossly”.”\n\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_132\">72.   The legal position in England remains the same  as  stated  in  R.  v.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_141\">Bateman (supra).  That is evident from a much later decision  of  the  House\nof Lords in R. v. Adomako (1994) 3 All ER 79 where the  legal  principle  of\nnegligence in cases  involving  manslaughter  by  criminal  negligence  were\nsummed up in the following words:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_133\">           “...In my opinion the law as stated in these two authorities  is\n           satisfactory as providing a  proper  basis  for  describing  the\n           crime of involuntary manslaughter. Since the decision in Andrews\n           v. DPP (1937) 2 All ER 552, was a decision  of  your  Lordships&#x27;\n           House, it  remains  the  most  authoritative  statement  of  the\n           present law which I have been able  to  find  and  although  its\n           relationship to R. v. Seymour (1983) 2 ALL ER 1058 is  a  matter\n           to which I shall have to return, it is a decision which has  not\n           been departed from.  On this basis in my  opinion  the  ordinary\n           principles of the law of negligence apply to  ascertain  whether\n           or not the defendant has been  in  breach  of  a  duty  of  care\n           towards the victim who has died.  If  such  breach  of  duty  is\n           established the next question is whether  that  breach  of  duty\n           caused the death of the victim. If so, the jury must  go  on  to\n           consider whether that breach of duty should be characterised  as\n           gross negligence and therefore as a crime. This will  depend  on\n           the seriousness of the breach of duty committed by the defendant\n           in all the circumstances in which the defendant was placed  when\n           it occurred. The jury will have to consider whether  the  extent\n           to which  the  defendant&#x27;s  conduct  departed  from  the  proper\n           standard of care incumbent upon him, involving as it  must  have\n           done a risk of death to the patient, was such that it should  be\n           judged criminal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_134\">                 It is true that  to  a  certain  extent  this  involves  an\n           element of circularity, but in this branch of the law I  do  not\n           believe that is fatal to its being correct as a test of how  far\n           conduct must depart from accepted standards to be  characterised\n           as criminal. This is necessarily a question  of  degree  and  an\n           attempt to specify that degree more closely is I think likely to\n           achieve only a spurious precision. The essence  of  the  matter,\n           which is supremely a jury question, is whether, having regard to\n           the risk of death involved, the conduct of the defendant was  so\n           bad in all the circumstances as to amount in their judgment to a\n           criminal act or omission...”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_135\">73.   There is no gainsaying that negligence in order to provide a cause  of\naction  to  the  affected  party  to  sue  for  damages  is  different  from\nnegligence which the prosecution would be required  to  prove  in  order  to\nestablish a charge of ‘involuntary manslaughter’ in  England,  analogous  to\nwhat is punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 304A</a>, IPC in India.  In the latter case  it\nis imperative for the prosecution to  establish  that  the  negligence  with\nwhich the accused is charged is ‘gross’ in nature no  matter  <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_52\">Section  304A</a>,\nIPC does not use that expression.  What is ‘gross’  would  depend  upon  the\nfact  situation  in  each  case  and  cannot,  therefore,  be  defined  with\ncertitude. Decided cases alone can illustrate what has  been  considered  to\nbe gross negligence in a given situation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_136\">74.   We propose to revert to the subject at an appropriate stage and  refer\nto some of the decided cases in which this Court had an occasion to  examine\nwhether the negligence alleged against the  accused  was  gross,  so  as  to\nconstitute an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 304A</a> of the IPC.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_142\"> (V)  Doctrine of Causa Causans:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_137\">75.

This aspect of the legal requirement  is  also  settled\nby a long line of decisions of Courts in this country. We may at the  outset\nrefer to a Division Bench decision of the High Court of  Bombay  in  <a href=\"/doc/581928/\" id=\"a_55\">Emperor\nv. Omkar Rampratap</a> (1902) 4 Bom LR 679 where Sir Lawrence  Jenkins  speaking\nfor the Court summed up the legal position in the following words:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_138\">           “…to impose criminal liability under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 304-A</a>, Indian Penal\n           Code, it is necessary that the act should have been  the  direct\n           result of a rash and negligent act of the accused and  that  act\n           must be proximate and efficient cause without  the  intervention\n           of another negligence.  It must have been the causa causans;  it\n           is not enough that it may have been the causa sine qua non.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1097044\" id=\"span_11\">76.

We\nshall refer to the facts of this case a little later especially because  Mr.\nJethmalani, learned Counsel for the  appellant-Sushil  Ansal,  placed  heavy\nreliance upon the view this Court has taken in the fact  situation  of  that\ncase.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"113074\" id=\"span_12\">77.

A subsequent decision of this Court in  <a href=\"/doc/113074/\" id=\"a_59\">Suleman  Rahiman  Mulani\nv.

To sum up: for an offence under Section 304-A to be proved it  is  not\nonly necessary to establish that the accused  was  either  rash  or  grossly\nnegligent but also that such rashness or  gross  negligence  was  the  causa\ncausans that resulted in the death of the victim. As to  what  is  meant  by\ncausa causans we may  gainfully  refer  to  Black’s  Law  Dictionary  (Fifth\nEdition) which defines that expression as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">           “The immediate cause; the last link in the chain of causation.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\">80.   The Advance Law Lexicon edited by Justice  Chandrachud,  former  Chief\nJustice of India defines Causa Causans as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">           ”the immediate cause as opposed to a  remote  cause;  the  ‘last\n           link in the chain of causation’; the  real  effective  cause  of\n           damage”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_147\">81.   The expression “proximate cause” is defined  in  the  5th  edition  of\nBlack’s Law Dictionary as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">           “That which in a natural and continuous sequence unbroken by any\n           efficient, intervening cause, produces injury and without  which\n           the result  would  not  have  occurred.

The\n           proximate cause of an injury is the primary or moving cause,  or\n           that which in a natural and continuous sequence, unbroken by any\n           efficient intervening cause, produces  the  injury  and  without\n           which the accident could not have happened, if the injury be one\n           which might be reasonably anticipated or foreseen as  a  natural\n           consequence  of  the  wrongful  act.  An  injury  or  damage  is\n           proximately caused by an act, or a failure to act,  whenever  it\n           appears from the evidence in the case, that the act or  omission\n           played a substantial part in bringing about or actually  causing\n           the injury or damage; and that the injury or damage was either a\n           direct result or a reasonably probable consequence of the act or\n           omission.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">(vi)  Whether Ansal brothers were occupiers of Uphaar cinema building:\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_148\">82.   In cases where negligence is alleged in regard  to  use  of  buildings\nand structures permanent or temporary, the duty to  care  is  fixed  on  the\nperson or persons who were occupiers of such buildings or structures.  Since\nthe charge in the present case also relates to the use of  a  building,  the\nquestion whether the appellants Sushil and Gopal Ansal, were  the  occupiers\nof Uphaar Cinema, so as to cast  a  duty  to  care  upon  them  towards  the\npatrons who came to watch the  exhibition  of  cinematographs  needs  to  be\naddressed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_149\">83.    Appearing  for  Sushil  Ansal  Mr.  Ram  Jethmalani,  learned  senior\nadvocate, in his inimitable style and remarkable forensic skill argued  that\nhis client Sushil Ansal was not the occupier of the Uphaar  Cinema  nor  did\nhe owe any duty of care towards those who came to watch  the  movie  on  the\nfateful day so as to give rise to any civil or  criminal  liability  against\nhis client for the alleged  breach  of  any  such  duty.  Mr.  Sushil  Kumar\nappearing for Gopal Ansal, adopted a similar  line  of  argument  and  urged\nthat even Gopal Ansal had nothing to do with the cinema  or  the  management\nof its affairs as on the date of the unfortunate  fire  incident.   Reliance\nin support of that submission was placed both  by  Mr.  Jethmalani  and  Mr.\nSushil Kumar on the fact that the Cinema was owned by  GPTA  Pvt.  Ltd.  and\nlater by Ansal Theaters &amp; Clubotels Pvt. Ltd. who alone could be said to  be\nthe occupiers of the Cinema at the relevant  point  of  time.  Reliance  was\nalso placed upon the fact that Sushil Ansal was  the  Managing  Director  of\nthe Company only till 21st November, 1983.  He had finally retired from  the\nBoard on 17th October, 1988, thereby putting an end to his association  with\nthe Cinema and its affairs. Even Gopal  Ansal  who  took  over  as  Managing\nDirector of the Company on 21st November, 1983 had retired  from  the  Board\nof Directors on 17th October, 1988, whereafter he exercised no control  over\nthe Cinema or its management to earn him what is  retrospect  is  a  dubious\ndistinction of being the “occupier of the cinema”.  He had no doubt  resumed\nthe Directorship of the company for a period  of  six  months  in  December,\n1994, but was concerned only with the business of the  Clubs  being  run  by\nthe company. This implied, according to the learned  counsel,  that  neither\nSushil nor Gopal Ansal was the occupier of the Cinema on  the  date  of  the\noccurrence to give rise to any civil or criminal liability against them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_150\">84.   Before we deal with  the  factual  backdrop,  in  which  the  question\nwhether the Ansal Brothers were occupiers of the Cinema has to be  answered,\nwe must steer clear of the impression that an occupier must be the owner  of\nthe premises. While it is true that an owner may in a given  fact  situation\nbe also the occupier of the premises owned by him, it is not correct to  say\nthat for being an  occupier  one  must  necessarily  be  the  owner  of  the\npremises in  question.   What  is  important  is  whether  the  premises  in\nquestion  was  sufficiently  and  not  exclusively  under  the  control   of\ndefendant/accused, and for being in such control, ownership of the  premises\nis not a condition  precedent.   An  occupier  may  be  in  control  of  the\npremises even when he does not own the same whether fully  or  jointly  with\nothers.  It is also not necessary that the control  must  be  full  and  all\npervasive. It follows that if  there  are  more  than  one  occupiers  of  a\nbuilding, and each one neglects the duty  to  care,  the  liability  whether\ncivil or criminal will fall on all of them.   The  law  on  the  subject  is\nsettled in England by the decision of the House of  Lords  in  Wheat  v.  E.\nLacon &amp; Co. (supra), where Lord  Denning  applied  the  test  of  sufficient\ndegree of control and not exclusive or entire control to  determine  whether\nthe person concerned was an occupier. The following passage is  apposite  in\nthis regard:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">           “It was simply a convenient word to denote a person  who  had  a\n           sufficient degree of control over premises to put  him  under  a\n           duty of care towards those who came lawfully on to the premises.\n           In order to be an &#x27;occupier&#x27; it is not necessary for a person to\n           have  entire  control  over  the  premises.  He  need  not  have\n           exclusive occupation. Suffice it that  he  has  some  degree  of\n           control. He may share the control with others. Two or  more  may\n           be occupiers. And whenever this happens, each is under a duty to\n           use care towards persons coming lawfully  on  to  the  premises,\n           dependent on his degree of control. If each fails in  his  duty,\n           each is liable to a visitor who is injured in consequence of his\n           failure but each may have  a  claim  to  contribution  from  the\n           other.”\n\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_151\">85.   To the same effect is the decision in H &amp; N Emanuel  Ltd.  v.  Greater\nLondon  Council  &amp;  Anr.  (supra)  where  the  Court  made   the   following\nobservations:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">           “Any person was an occupier for the purposes of fire if he had a\n           sufficient degree of control over the  premises  and  could  say\n           with authority to anyone who came there, “Do or do not  light  a\n           fire,” or “Put out that fire”. If he could, he  was  liable  for\n           negligence on the part of any person who came there.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_152\">86.   Coming to the facts of the case at hand, merely  because  the  company\nwas the legal owner of the Cinema premises, did not mean  that  the  Company\nand Company alone was the occupier thereof. The question whether  the  Ansal\nBrothers (Sushil and Gopal) exercised any control over the  affairs  of  the\nCinema, and its maintenance was a pure  and  simple  question  of  fact,  on\nwhich a great deal of evidence was led at the trial, and appreciated by  the\ntwo Courts below. We have in the preceding part of  this  judgment  referred\nto the findings of fact recorded by the Courts below on  that  aspect.  But,\nfor the sake of completeness, we may refer to those findings in some  detail\nat this stage over again.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_153\">87.   The trial Court and, so also, the High Court  have  both  concurrently\nheld that Sushil and Gopal Ansal were, at all material times,  at  the  helm\nof the affairs of  the  company  that  owned  Uphaar  cinema.   All  crucial\ndecisions relating to the cinema including decisions regarding  installation\nof DVB transformer on the  premises,  closure  of  the  right  side  exit  &amp;\ngangway and rearrangement of the seating plan  in  the  balcony  were  taken\nwhile either one or the other of the two was either a Director  or  Managing\nDirector of the company.  Both the Courts  have  further  found  that  Ansal\nbrother’s control over the day-to-day affairs  and  the  staff  employed  to\nlook after the cinema  management  continued  even  upto  the  date  of  the\nincident. In particular the Courts below have  concurrently  held  that  the\ndecision to install the DVB transformer and to let out various parts of  the\npremises for commercial use in violation of the sanctioned plan  were  taken\nby Sushil Ansal as Managing Director  of  the   company.   Applications  for\ngrant of the cinema license and subsequent renewals were found to have  been\nmade by him as the representative licensee on behalf  of  the  company  even\nafter his purported retirement from the Board of Directors.  Not only  that,\nthe Courts below have concurrently held that Sushil Ansal was  exercising  a\nhigh degree of financial control over the affairs of  the  company  and  the\ncinema owned by  him.  Gopal  Ansal  was  similarly  exercising  an  equally\nextensive  degree  of  financial  control  even  after  his  retirement   as\nDirector. The Courts below have also found that all  decisions  relating  to\nchanges in the balcony seating arrangement and  installation  of  additional\nseats were taken during Gopal Ansal’s term as Managing Director and  at  his\nrequest.  The Courts have noticed and relied  upon  the  Show  Cause  Notice\ndated 28th May, 1982 in  which  Gopal  Ansal,  the  Managing  Director,  was\ncautioned  about  the  dangerous  practice  being  followed  by  the  cinema\nmanagement of bolting the doors of the cinema hall during the exhibition  of\nthe films.  An assurance to  the  effect  that  such  a  practice  would  be\ndiscontinued was given by Gopal Ansal as Managing Director of  the  company.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_154\">88.   In conclusion the High Court has outlined eight decisions  which  were\ndirectly attributable to the Ansal brothers including decisions relating  to\nthe day-to-day affairs and commercial use of the  cinema  premises  as  also\nthe seating arrangement in the balcony and in no  uncertain  terms  rejected\nthe argument that Ansal brothers had nothing to do with the company and  the\ncinema after their retirement from the Board  of  Directors  in  1988.   All\nthese findings are, in our opinion, supported by  overwhelming  evidence  on\nrecord which satisfactorily proves not only that  Ansal  brothers  continued\nto exercise all pervasive control over the affairs of the  cinema  but  also\nbecause the cinema license, at all material times, showed  Sushil  Ansal  as\nthe representative license of the Uphaar Cinema.   Our  attention  was  also\ndrawn to an affidavit filed by Sushil Ansal marked as  EX.PW.50/B  in  which\nSushil Ansal unequivocally acknowledged that he  was  the  occupier  of  the\ncinema.  The relevant portion of the affidavit reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">                 “I, Sushil Ansal, s/o Late Shri Charanji  Lal,  R/o  N-148,\n           Panchshila Park, New Delhi,  Chairman  of  Green  Park  Theatres\n           Associated (P) Ltd., 115 Ansal Bhawan, 16 Kastuba  Gandhi  Marg,\n           New Delhi – 110001, am applying for renewal of License  for  the\n           year 1992-93. I have not  without  permission,  transferred  the\n           License or the Licensed  place  or  the  Cinematographs  to  any\n           person during the year 1991-92 to exhibit films in the  Licensed\n           place.  I am still the occupier of  the  licensed  premises  and\n           owner of the Cinematograph.”\n\n                                             (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_155\">89.   The Courts below have, in our view, correctly noticed  the  fact  that\nnot one out of a total of 5000 shares of  the  company  was  ever  owned  by\nanyone outside the Ansal family. The Courts have also placed  reliance  upon\nthe depositions of Pranav Ansal (PW-109), V.K.  Aggarwal  (PW-113),  Subhash\nVerma (PW-114) and Kusum Ansal, wife of Sushil Ansal  (PW-115)  to  conclude\nthat all these persons who were Directors or had  financial  powers  on  the\ndate of the incident were completely unaware of the affairs of  the  company\nas well as the cinema enterprise, a fact, that goes  a  long  way  to  prove\nthat the cinema was being managed by Ansal brothers who had a complete  sway\nover its affairs.  What is worse is that some of these  witnesses  expressed\ntheir ignorance about whether  they  were  Directors  or  whether  they  had\nfinancial powers within the company or that the company was  still  involved\nin cinema business.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_156\">90.   The cumulative effect of the above facts and circumstances  proved  by\ncogent evidence placed on record by the  prosecution,  in  our  view,  fully\nsupports the prosecution case that Sushil  and  Gopal  Ansal  were  in  full\ncontrol over the affairs of the company which owned the cinema, as  well  as\nthe cinema itself,  at  all  material  times,  including  the  date  of  the\nincident.  We have, therefore, no hesitation in affirming the  finding  that\nthe Ansal brothers - Sushil and Gopal were  both  occupiers  of  the  cinema\ncomplex as on the date of the incident in which capacity they  owed  a  duty\nto care for the safety of the patrons visiting/coming to the premises.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_157\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1302578\" id=\"span_16\">91.   It was contended by Mr. Jethmalani that  the  offence  if  any  having\nbeen committed by  the  company,  officers  of  the  company  could  not  be\nvicariously held guilty of criminal negligence.   Reliance,  in  support  of\nthat submission was placed by Mr. Jethmalani upon the provisions of  <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_64\">Section\n141</a> of the Negotiable Instruments Act and the  decisions  of  the  Court  in\n<a href=\"/doc/1302578/\" id=\"a_65\">S.M.S. Pharmaceuticals Ltd. v. Neeta Bhalla</a> (2005) 8 SCC 89,  JK  Industries\nand others v. Chief Inspector of Factories and Boilers   (1996) 6  SCC  685.\nIt was urged that in the absence of any provisions in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_66\">IPC</a> rendering  the\nofficers of the company vicariously liable for prosecution for the  offences\ncommitted by the company, there was  no  question  of  the  appellant  Ansal\nbrothers being held guilty that too for  an  offence  committed  long  after\nthey had ceased to  hold  any  position  in  the  company.   We  regret  our\ninability to accept that submission.  We say so because the appellants  have\nnot been prosecuted as officers  of  a  company  accused  of  committing  an\noffence, nor is it the case of  the  prosecution  that  the  appellants  are\nvicariously liable as in the case of those falling under <a href=\"/doc/686130/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 141</a> of  the\nNegotiable Instruments Act.  The prosecution case on the other hand is  that\nin their capacity as occupiers the appellant Ansal brothers had  a  duty  to\ncare for the safety of the patrons which duty they grossly  neglected.   The\nentire substratum of the case is, therefore, different from  the  assumption\non which Mr. Jethmalani  has  built  his  argument.   The  assumption  being\nmisplaced, the argument can be no different.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_158\">(vii) Degree and nature  of  care  expected  of  an  occupier  of  a  cinema\n      building:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">92.   What is the degree of care expected from the occupier of a  cinema  is\nthe next question to which we must advert at this  stage.   Two  fundamental\nprinciples must be noticed at the threshold while answering  that  question.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_159\">The first is that the degree and nature of  care  expected  of  an  occupier\ndepends upon the fact situation in  which  the  duty  to  care  arises.  The\nsecond and equally important principle at common law is that the  degree  of\ncare in a given fact situation would depend upon whether the person to  whom\nthe duty is owed is a contractual visitor, invitee, licensee or  trespasser.\nOf these the occupier owes the highest  degree  of  care  to  a  contractual\nvisitor viz. a person who pays consideration to be present on  the  premises\nfor some purpose; whatever that purpose be.   At  common  law  there  is  an\nimplied term in the contract between the occupier and the visitor  that  the\noccupier’s premises shall be reasonably safe. The occupier’s  duty  must  be\nheld to have been breached if any injury is caused to a contractual  visitor\nby any defect in the premises  apart  from  a  latent  defect.   Winfield  &amp;\nJolowicz on Tort (Sixteenth Edition) explains the duty  of  an  occupier  to\ntake  care  towards  different  categories  of  visitors  in  the  following\npassage:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">           “At common law  the  duties  of  an  occupier  were  cast  in  a\n           descending scale to four different kinds of persons and a  brief\n           account is necessary to gain a full understanding  of  the  Act.\n           The highest degree of care was owed by the occupier to  one  who\n           entered in pursuance of a contract with him (for example a guest\n           in an hotel): in that case there was an  implied  warranty  that\n           the premises were as safe as reasonable  care  and  skill  could\n           make them. A lower duty was owed to the “invitee”,  that  is  to\n           say, a person who (without any contract) entered on business  of\n           interest both  to  himself  and  the  occupier  (for  example  a\n           customer coming into a shop to view the wares): he was  entitled\n           to expect that the occupier should prevent damage  from  unusual\n           danger, of which he knew or ought to have  known.   Lower  still\n           was the duty to the “licensee”, a person who  entered  with  the\n           occupier’s  express  or  implied  permission  but  without   any\n           community of interest with the  occupier:  the  occupier’s  duty\n           towards him was to warn him of any concealed danger or  trap  of\n           which he actually knew. Finally, there was  the  trespasser,  to\n           whom under the original common law there was owed only a duty to\n           abstain from deliberate or reckless injury.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">93.    One  of  the  earliest  common  law  decisions  regarding  occupier’s\nliability to visitors is in Mclenan v.  Segar  (1917)  2  KB  325  where  an\ninnkeeper was held liable for injury caused to a guest while  escaping  from\na fire in the  inn.  The  fire  was  caused  because  there  was  no  proper\nmechanism for conveying the smoke and burning soot from the kitchen  chimney\nto the atmosphere. The mechanism for conveying the smoke had been  installed\nin 1910 by an architect employed by the landlord  from  whom  the  innkeeper\nhad taken the premises on lease. However, the fact  that  the  defect  arose\nfrom the  architect&#x27;s  negligence  did  not  prevent  liability  from  being\nimposed on the innkeeper.  The  relevant  portion  of  the  judgment  is  as\nfollows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">           “Where the occupier of premises agrees for reward that a  person\n           shall have the right to  enter  and  use  them  for  a  mutually\n           contemplated purpose, the contract between the  parties  (unless\n           it provides to the contrary) contains an implied  warranty  that\n           the premises are as safe for that purpose as reasonable\n           care and skill on the part of anyone can make them. The rule  is\n           subject to the limitation that the Defendant is not to  be  held\n           responsible for defects which could not have been discovered  by\n           reasonable care or skill on the part  of  any  person  concerned\n           with the construction, alteration, repair, or maintenance of the\n           premises: and the head-note to Francis v. Cockrell must to  this\n           extent be corrected. But subject to this limitation  it  matters\n           not whether the lack of care or skill be that of  the  Defendant\n           or his servants, or that of an  independent  contractor  or  his\n           servants, or whether the negligence takes place before or  after\n           the occupation by the Defendant of the premises.”\n\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">94.   To the common law duty of care is at times added a further  obligation\nwhich too the occupier must discharge in order that his duty to care can  be\nsaid to have been  fully  discharged.  Such  duties  are  often  cast  under\nstatutes enacted by the legislature or in  Rules  &amp;  Regulations  framed  in\nexercise of  powers  delegated  under  such  enactments.   These  additional\nsafeguards against injury to life and  limb  of  innocent  parties  who  are\nworking in the premises or who visit such premises, in  large  numbers,  are\nin  public  interest  and  imply  that  even  the   ‘State’   in   all   its\nmanifestations is concerned about the safety of those visiting  such  public\nplaces, be it a cinema hall as in the case at hand or  any  other  place  of\nentertainment or a place where people go for any other  purpose  whether  as\ncontractual visitors or otherwise.  The existence of such a  statutory  duty\nespecially one that concerns safety of the visitors adds  another  dimension\nto the duty to care to which we shall presently advert.  But  before  we  do\nso we need to examine whether any such statutory  duty  was  cast  upon  the\noccupier of the cinema and if so what was the nature of that duty.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">95.   <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_68\">The Cinematograph Act, 1952</a> inter alia regulates exhibition  of  films\nby means of cinematographs.  <a href=\"/doc/459780/\" id=\"a_69\">Section 10</a> of the Act, provides  that  save  as\notherwise provided under <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_70\">Part III  of  the  Act</a>  no  person  shall  give  an\nexhibition by means of a cinematograph elsewhere them in  a  place  licensed\nunder this part or otherwise than in  compliance  with  any  conditions  and\nrestrictions imposed by such license.  <a href=\"/doc/1769491/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 12</a> of the Act stipulates  the\nrestrictions on powers of the licensing Authority and  forbids  grant  of  a\nlicense except where he is satisfied that the  rules  made  under  Part  III\nhave been substantially complied with and  adequate  precautions  have  been\ntaken in the place in respect of  which  the  license  is  to  be  given  to\nprovide for safety of persons attending exhibitions therein.  <a href=\"/doc/218033/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 16</a>  of\nthe Act empowers the Government to make rules under <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_73\">Part  III  of  the  Act</a>,\nwhich part as noticed above also  makes  safety  of  persons  attending  the\nexhibition an important requirement.  Rule 10(1) of the Delhi  Cinematograph\nRules framed in exercise of the said power  explicitly  makes  the  licensee\nresponsible for the safety of those attending the exhibition of  films.   It\nreads:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">           “10(1) The licensee shall be responsible for compliance with the\n           provisions of  these  rules  and  with  the  conditions  of  his\n           license, for the maintenance of the  licensed  premises  at  all\n           times and in all  respects  in  conformity  with  the  standards\n           prescribed by these rules and for taking all necessary  measures\n           before any cinematograph exhibition is commenced to  ensure  the\n           safety of the public and his employees against  fire  and  other\n           accidents.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">           (2) The licensee or some responsible person nominated by him  in\n           writing for the purpose  shall  be  in  general  charge  of  the\n           licensed premises and cinematograph during the whole time  where\n           any exhibition is in progress.”\n\n                                                         (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">96.   The rules make further provisions for  safety  of  the  cinema  goers.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_160\">For instance Rules 24 and 37 of the <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_74\">Delhi Cinematograph  Act,  1953</a>  provide\nfor attendants to carry electric  torches  for  use  in  emergency  and  for\nkeeping the fire appliances in working order and  incharge  of  some  person\nspecially appointed for the  purpose.   The  said  two  rules  may  also  be\nextracted at this stage:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\">           “24. Attendants and all members of the  staff  employed  in  the\n           building during an exhibition shall carry electric  torches  for\n           use in emergency in the event of failure of the lighting.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_160\">           37.“Before   the   commencement   of   each   performance    the\n           cinematograph operator  shall  satisfy  himself  that  the  fire\n           appliances, intended for use within the enclosure are in working\n           order, and during the performance such appliances  shall  be  in\n           the charge of some person specially appointed for that  purpose,\n           who shall see that they are kept constantly available for use.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_161\">97.   The First Schedule to the DCR 1953  compliance  whereof  is  essential\nfor grant and renewal deals extensively with several  aspects  most  if  not\nall of which deal with the safety of the cinema goers. For instance  Para  3\nof the schedule deals with external walls, Para  6  of  the  schedule  deals\nwith the number of persons to be admitted, Para 7 with  seating  within  the\nhall, Para 8 with gangways, Para 9 with stairways, Para 10 with exits,  Para\n13 with ventilation, Para 15 with Parking, Para 16  with  fire  precautions,\nPara 34(1) with illumination of exits, passages,  corridors  and  stairways,\nParas 35 and 36 with emergency lights.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_162\">98.   A conspectus of the provisions of the Act and the  rules  referred  to\nabove shows that the duty to “ensure safety”  of  those  entering  a  cinema\nhall for watching the exhibition of a film, is cast  upon  the  occupier  of\nthe hall.  The  use  of  words  “taking  all  necessary  measures  before  a\ncinematograph exhibition is commenced to ensure safety  of  the  public  and\nhis employees against fair and other accidents” leaves no  manner  of  doubt\nthat apart from the common law duty to care, the  statutory  provisions  too\ncast such an obligation upon the licence/occupier of the cinema hall.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_163\">99.   That brings us to the question whether and if so what  is  the  effect\nof a statutory obligation to care for  the  safety  of  the  visitors  to  a\ncinema hall, where a duty to care otherwise exists  under  the  common  law.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_161\">The answer can be best provided by a reference to the  English  decision  in\nLochgelly Iron &amp; Coal Co. Ltd. v. M’Mullan, (1934) AC 1. A reading  of  this\ncase would suggest that where a duty of care exists under  common  law,  and\nthis duty is additionally supported and clarified by  statutory  provisions,\na breach of the statutory duty would  be  proof  enough  of  negligence.  It\nwould not be open to the defendant in such a case to  argue  that  the  harm\nwas not foreseeable, since “the very object of the  legislation  is  to  put\nthat particular precaution beyond controversy”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_162\">100.   The import and significance of the  case  is  explained  in  Clerk  &amp;\nLindsell on Torts (Twentieth Edition) as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\">           “In Lochgelly Iron &amp; Coal Co Ltd v. M&#x27;Mullan, the House of Lords\n           came close to equating an action for breach  of  statutory  duty\n           with an action in negligence. Lord Atkin said that all that  was\n           necessary to show “is a duty to take care to avoid injuring; and\n           if the particular care to be taken is prescribed by statute, and\n           the duty to the injured person to  take  the  care  is  likewise\n           imposed by statute, and the breach is proved, all the essentials\n           of negligence are present”. Negligence did  not  depend  on  the\n           Court agreeing with the legislature that the precaution ought to\n           have been taken, because the “very object of the legislation  is\n           to put that particular precaution beyond controversy”.  On  this\n           approach breach of a statutory duty constitutes  negligence  per\n           se, but it applies only to  legislation  which  is  designed  to\n           prevent a particular mischief in respect of which the  defendant\n           is already under a duty in  common  law.  Failure  to  meet  the\n           prescribed statutory standard is then  treated  as  unreasonable\n           conduct amounting to negligence, because a reasonable man  would\n           not ignore precautions required by statute,  and  the  defendant\n           cannot  claim  that  the  harm  was  unforeseeable  because  the\n           legislature has already anticipated it. The  statutory  standard\n           “crystallises” the question of what constitutes carelessness. On\n           the  other  hand,  where  legislation   does   not   deal   with\n           circumstances in which there is an  existing  common  law  duty,\n           then, unless expressly stated, breach of the statute  would  not\n           give rise to an action, because the damages may  greatly  exceed\n           the penalty considered appropriate by the legislature.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">101.  Reverting back to the  degree  and  nature  of  care  expected  of  an\noccupier of a cinema hall, we must at the outset say  that  the  nature  and\ndegree of care is expected to be such as would  ensure  the  safety  of  the\nvisitors against all foreseeable dangers and harm. That is  the  essence  of\nthe duty which an occupier owes  to  the  invitees  whether  contractual  or\notherwise. The nature of care that the occupier must, therefore, take  would\ndepend upon the fact situation in which duty to care arises.  For  instance,\nin the case of a hotel which  offers  to  its  clients  the  facility  of  a\nswimming pool, the nature of the care that the occupier of the  hotel  would\nbe expected to take would be different from what is expected of an  occupier\nof a cinema hall.  In the former case,  the  occupier  may  be  expected  to\nensure that the pool is safe for use by the guests in  the  hotel,  in  that\nthe depth is safe for those using the diving board if any, that life  guards\nare on duty  when  children  or  other  guests  are  using  the  pool,  that\nimmediate medical succor  is  provided  to  those  who  may  meet  with  any\naccident, and so on.  The nature of duty is in  that  sense  different  from\nthat of cinema owner/occupier, where all these may  not  form  part  of  his\nduty to care.  In the case of a cinema hall  the  nature  of  an  occupier’s\nduty to care may, inter alia, require him to  ensure  rapid  dispersal  from\nthe hall in the event of any fire or other emergency, and for  that  purpose\nto provide suitable gangways and keep them  clear  of  any  obstruction,  to\nprovide proper exits,  to  keep  the  exit  signs  illuminated,  to  provide\nemergency lighting, to provide fire fighting systems, alarm systems  and  to\nemploy and  keep  trained  personnel  on  duty  whenever  an  exhibition  of\ncinematograph is in progress.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_164\">102.  An occupier of a cinema would be expected  to  take  all  those  steps\nwhich are a part of his duty to care for the  safety  and  security  of  all\nthose visiting the cinema for watching a cinematograph exhibition.  What  is\nimportant is that the duty to  care  is  not  a  onetime  affair.  It  is  a\ncontinuing  obligation  which  the  occupier  owes  towards  every   invitee\ncontractual or otherwise every  time  an  exhibition  of  the  cinematograph\ntakes place.  What is equally important is that not only  under  the  common\nlaw but even under the statutory regimen, the obligation  to  ensure  safety\nof the invitees is undeniable, and any neglect of  the  duty  is  actionable\nboth as a civil and criminal wrong, depending upon  whether  the  negligence\nis simple or gross.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_165\">103.  In the case  of  gross  negligence  prosecution  and  damages  may  be\nclaimed simultaneously and not necessarily in the  alternative.  We  may  at\nthis stage refer to a few pronouncements to  illustrate  that  the  duty  to\ncare and the nature of care expected of any person accused of committing  an\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 304A</a> IPC has always been seen in the  fact  situations\nin which the  question  arose.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1528053\" id=\"span_17\">In  <a href=\"/doc/1528053/\" id=\"a_76\">Bhalchandra  Waman  Pathe  v.

The accused <a href=\"/doc/1528053/\" id=\"a_78\">in that case</a>  had  failed  to  take\ncare and do that, resulting in the death of a pedestrian  who  was  crossing\nthe road.

This Court held that since the  speed  limit  was  35\nmiles per hour, and since the accused was driving the car  at  35  miles  an\nhour, there was no rashness  on  his  part  in  the  absence  of  any  other\ncircumstance showing that he was driving at a reckless speed.  Even  so  the\ncharge of negligence was held proved against the accused as he had  breached\nthe duty cast upon him to see  whether  there  was  any  pedestrian  to  the\npedestrian crossing.  Law,  observed  this  Court,  enjoined  upon  him  and\nordinary human prudence required him to do so. Failure  of  the  accused  to\nexercise that reasonable care and caution rendered him  liable  in  criminal\nlaw to a conviction under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 304A</a> of the IPC. This Court  approved  the\nratio of the  decisions  in  Idu  Beg  and  Nidamarti  cases  (supra),  that\ndistinguished ‘rashness’ and ‘negligence’,  and  held  that  while  rashness\nimplies recklessness or  indifference  to  consequences,  negligence  arises\nfrom neglect of a civic duty of circumspection, “which having regard to  all\nthe circumstances out of which the charge has arisen, it was the  imperative\nduty of the accused person to have adopted.” Rashness, observed this  Court,\nwas undoubtedly a graver offence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\">104.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1748452\" id=\"span_18\">In <a href=\"/doc/1748452/\" id=\"a_80\">Bhalchandra @ Bapu and Anr. v. State of Maharashtra</a>, 1968  (3)  SCR\n766, this Court was dealing with a case in which an explosion in  a  factory\nmanufacturing crackers had caused the death  of  some  of  the  workers  and\ninjured others. The findings recorded by  the  Courts  below  was  that  the\naccused had in their possession unauthorized explosives in contravention  of\nthe Act and the Rules and had committed several breaches of those Rules  and\nthe conditions of the license issued to them.  Relying  upon  the  decisions\nof this Court in Kurban Hussein’s case (supra) and Suleman Rahiman  Mulani’s\ncase (supra), it was contended that mere violation of Rules or  terms  of  a\nlicence  would not make the accused liable for any punitive  action  against\nthem. The decisions of this Court in Kurban Hussein’s  and  Suleman  Rahiman\nMulani’s cases (supra) were distinguished by this Court and  the  conviction\nof the accused under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 304A</a> IPC upheld in the following words:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">           “...The facts of the present case  are  somewhat  different  and\n           distinguishable from those of the above two  cases  as  will  be\n           clear from a close examination of the material evidence relating\n           to the substances which were being used in  the  manufacture  of\n           the fire works etc. in the factory of the appellants...\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">           xx xx xx\n\n\n           …Although there was no direct evidence of the immediate cause of\n           the explosion but indisputably the explosives the possession  of\n           which was prohibited under the notifications  issued  under  the\n           Act were found in the shops or the premises where the appellants\n           carried on their business and  the  substances  that  have  been\n           mentioned which were of a highly hazardous and dangerous  nature\n           were apparently being used in the manufacture of the fire  works\n           since they were found at the scene of the explosion,  (vide  the\n           evidence mentioned before and the finding of the trial court and\n           the Additional Sessions Judge). As stated by  Dindeshchandra  PW\n           10 these explosives had sensitive compositions and even friction\n           or percussion could cause explosion. It is further  proved  that\n           in the factory itself where the explosion took place the persons\n           who were employed were mostly  women  who  brought  their  small\n           children with them and young children below the age  of  18  had\n           been employed in the manufacture of  the  fire  works  etc.  The\n           factory was situate in close proximity to residential  quarters.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_167\">           It became therefore all the more incumbent on the appellants  to\n           have completely avoided the use of highly sensitive compositions\n           of the nature mentioned above.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_168\">                 The decision which is apposite to the present case  is  the\n           one recently delivered by this Court on April 3, 1968 in  Rustom\n           Sherior Irani v. State of Maharashtra. There the  chimney  of  a\n           bakery had collapsed and 11  persons  were  killed  and  certain\n           persons were injured. The appellant had submitted  no  plan  for\n           the alteration of the chimney for the third time and  had  asked\n           just a mason to remove the iron pipe which had corroded  and  to\n           bring the height of the chimney to 65 feet. The mason  had  told\n           him that while the work was being executed it was unnecessary to\n           completely keep the bakery closed except during the  period  the\n           repair work was being done. After the chimney fell down a number\n           of officers visited the spot and inspected the bakery. The Chief\n           Inspector of Boilers was of the opinion that the  cause  of  the\n           collapse of the chimney was the explosion which occurred  in  it\n           because of the  products  of  combustion  and  gases  not  being\n           permitted to escape freely as a pipe of 6  inches  diameter  had\n           been put instead of 12 inches diameter.  It  is  unnecessary  to\n           refer to  the  detailed  discussion  of  the  evidence.  It  was\n           established that the construction of the new  chimney  had  been\n           done without the advice of  a  properly  qualified  person.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1969872\" id=\"span_19\">The\n           argument raised was on the lines similar to the  one  which  had\n           been advanced in <a href=\"/doc/1969872/\" id=\"a_82\">Kurban Hussein Mohammedali Rangwalla  v.  State\n           of Maharashtra</a>. It was maintained that no negligence on the part\n           of the appellant had been established and it was on  account  of\n           the negligence of the mason that the chimney  had  fallen  down.\n           This Court was of the view  that  the  proximate  and  efficient\n           cause of the deaths was  the  negligence  of  the  appellant  in\n           choosing a pipe of 6 inches diameter and asking a mason (who was\n           apparently not a qualified person) to carry out the  alterations\n           and also continuing working atleast one oven  there  during  the\n           period while the alterations to the chimney were being made.”</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_169\">105.

It is noteworthy that in Rex. v. Pittwood (supra),  the\nprisoner was charged with manslaughter  on  the  ground  that  he  had  been\nnegligent in not closing a gate when a train passed which it  was  his  duty\nto do with the result that White who was in a hay cart was killed while  the\ncart was struck by the train which came when it was crossing the line.   The\nCourt had in that case, held the prisoner liable as it was his duty to  keep\nthe gate shut to protect the public against an oncoming train. This  act  of\nmisfeasance was held to constitute gross negligence in the discharge of  his\nduty towards the public crossing  the  road,  amounting  to  an  offence  of\nmanslaughter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_170\">106.  In S.N.

When the bus reached the level  crossing  the\ngate was open. The accused- bus driver finding the  gate  open  crossed  the\nmeter gauge track when suddenly a goods train dashed against the bus on  the\nrear side with the result  that  the  bus  was  thrown  off  course  causing\nserious injuries to several passengers,  one  of  whom  was  killed  in  the\naccident.  The  appellant’s  defense  was  that  he  was  neither  rash  nor\nnegligent and the accident was unavoidable for he did  not  realize  that  a\ngoods train was passing at the time and since the gate was open  he  crossed\nthe railway crossing absolutely oblivious of  the  fact  that  a  train  was\napproaching.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1528053\" id=\"span_20\">107.  The Trial Court accepted that explanation and acquitted  the  accused.\nThe High Court reversed the order and  convicted  him.  This  Court  relying\nupon the definition of criminal rashness and criminal  negligence  given  by\nStraight J. in Empress v. Idu beg (supra) and in <a href=\"/doc/1528053/\" id=\"a_83\">Bhalchandra Waman Pathe  v.\nState of Maharashtra</a> (supra) held that where a railway  level  crossing  was\nunmanned, it may be right to insist that the driver of  the  vehicle  should\nstop the vehicle, look both ways to  see  if  a  train  is  approaching  and\nthereafter drive the vehicle after satisfying that there was  no  danger  in\ncrossing the railway track. Where the level  crossing  was  protected  by  a\ngateman and the gateman opens out the gate inviting the  vehicles  to  pass,\nit will be too much to expect the driver to stop his vehicle  and  look  out\nfor any approaching train. The Court accordingly acquitted the appellant  of\nthe offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 304A</a> IPC.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_172\">108.  A conspectus of the decisions quoted above  reveals  that  an  offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 304A</a> IPC may arise under a variety of  circumstances,  ranging\nfrom reckless driving of vehicles to negligent handling of explosives  in  a\nfactory. In every case, this Court has been mindful to determine the  nature\nof care which ought to have been exercised by  the  accused  person  in  the\ncontext of all the facts and circumstances  of  that  case.  Moreover,  this\nCourt has been careful while applying or distinguishing preceding  case  law\nrelating to Section 304A to read each case in the context of its own  facts,\nwithout deriving from it any general  propositions  to  be  applied  in  all\ncases dealing with the same offence. Therefore, the question of  the  nature\nof care which ought to have  been  exercised  by  the  occupiers  of  Uphaar\nCinema, as ordinary prudent businessmen,  must  be  decided  solely  on  the\ntotality of the facts and circumstances of the present case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1691320\" id=\"span_21\">109.  In the case at hand, the  claim  for  compensation  has  already  been\nawarded by the High Court and affirmed by this Court, no matter against  the\ncompany as the owner of the  cinema  hall.  Dealing  with  the  question  of\nnegligence, this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1691320/\" id=\"a_86\">Municipal Council of Delhi, Delhi  v.  Association\nof Victims</a> for Uphaar Tragedy and Ors. (2011) 14 SCC 481 observed:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_167\">                 “27. At the outset it should be noted that the  causes  for\n           the calamity have been very exhaustively considered by the  High\n           Court and it  has  recorded  a  categorical  finding  about  the\n           negligence and the liability on the part of the licensee and the\n           DVB. On the examination of the records, we agree with  the  High\n           Court that such a catastrophic incident would not have  happened\n           if the parapet wall had not been raised to the  roof  level.  If\n           the said  wall  had  not  been  raised,  the  fumes  would  have\n           dispersed in the atmospheric air. Secondly if one of  the  exits\n           in the balcony had  not  been  blocked  by  construction  of  an\n           owner&#x27;s box and if the right side gangway had not been closed by\n           fixing seats, the visitors in  the  balcony  could  have  easily\n           dispersed through the other gangway and exit into the unaffected\n           staircase. Thirdly if the  cars  had  not  been  parked  in  the\n           immediate vicinity of the transformer room and  appropriate  pit\n           had been made for draining of transformer oil, the oil would not\n           have leaked into the passage nor would the burning  oil  lighted\n           the cars, as the fire would have been  restricted  only  to  the\n           transformer room. Even if one of the three causes for which  the\n           theatre owner was responsible, was absent,  the  calamity  would\n           not have occurred. The Licensee could not point out any error in\n           those findings.  Ultimately  therefore  the  contention  of  the\n           licensee before us was not to deny liability but only to  reduce\n           the quantum of liability fastened  by  the  High  Court  and  to\n           increase the share of  the  liability  of  the  three  statutory\n           authorities.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_168\">                 xxx              xxx              xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_169\">           57.   The licensee argued that the entire  liability  should  be\n           placed upon the DVB. It was contended that DVB have installed  a\n           transformer of a capacity  of  1000  KV  without  obtaining  the\n           statutory sanction/approval and without providing all the safety\n           measures which it was duty bound to provide under  the  relevant\n           Electricity  Rules,  and  therefore,   DVB   alone   should   be\n           responsible for the tragedy. This contention has  no  merit.  In\n           fact none in the main hall (ground floor of the  theatre)  died.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_174\">           Those on the second floor also escaped. It is only those in  the\n           balcony caught in noxious fumes, which died of asphyxiation. The\n           deaths were on account of the negligence and greed on  the  part\n           of the licensee in regard to installation of  additional  seats,\n           in regard to closing of an exit door, parking of cars  in  front\n           of transformer room by increasing parking  from  15  to  35  and\n           other acts. We therefore reject the contention that  DVB  should\n           be made exclusively liable to  pay  the  compensation.  We  have\n           already held that  the  Licensing  Authority  and  MCD  are  not\n           liable. Therefore, the liability will be 85% (Licensee) and  15%\n           (DVB).”\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_175\">110.  Mr. Jethmalani, however, argued that the  findings  recorded  by  this\nCourt while dealing with the claim for payment of damages could not be  made\na basis for holding  the  appellant-Ansal  Brothers  guilty  of  an  offence\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 304A</a> of the IPC, not only  because  those  findings\nwere not recorded in  relation  to  the  appellants  but  also  because  the\nstandard of proof required for award  of  compensation  was  different  from\nthat  required  to  prove  a  criminal  charge.  There  is  merit  in   that\ncontention.  The standard of proof required being different, simply  because\ndamages have been awarded against the owner of the cinema  hall  can  be  no\nreason why the occupier should be found guilty of gross negligence  required\nto be proved for an offence under Section 304A. The  claim  for  payment  of\ncompensation was at any rate made and awarded against the company who  owned\nthe cinema hall. This Court cannot in that view make  use  of  the  findings\nrecorded in the compensation case nor is it otherwise necessary  for  us  to\ndo so for the evidence  adduced  at  the  trial  is  sufficient  for  us  to\nindependently  determine the question of negligence  as  also  the  criminal\nliability of the occupier of the cinema arising from the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_176\">111.  The nature of care in the case of cinema theatres  would  depend  upon\nthree primary factors that the occupier of the  cinema  must  at  all  times\nbear in mind. The  first  is  that  the  cinema  hall  is  an  enclosed  and\nnecessarily a dark space to which public at large have access on payment  of\na price for the ticket that entitles  him  to  watch  the  exhibition  of  a\ncinematograph.  Such theatres, at any  given  point  of  time,  admit  large\ncrowds of people whose safety is the obligation of the  occupier  till  such\ntime they leave the precincts  of  the  theatre.   The  duty  to  take  care\nregarding the safety of those admitted to watch  an  exhibition  rests  with\nthe occupier who can and ought to even by the  most  ordinary  standards  of\nprudence foresee that in the event of anything  untoward  happening  whether\nout of a fire incident or otherwise, those inside the  cinema  premises  can\nbe safe only if they exit from the same as rapidly as possible.   Any  delay\nwhether on account of obstruction in or around the exit  points  or  in  the\ngangways can be reasonably foreseen by any prudent businessman  running  the\nbusiness of exhibition of cinematographs to be extremely  hazardous  and  at\ntimes suicidal, with the potential of claiming human lives whether out of  a\nstampede, panic or asphyxiation in  the  event  of  a  fire.   It  does  not\nrequire any extra expertise for a cinema owner or the occupier of  a  cinema\ntheatre to foresee such consequences and to take remedial steps  to  prevent\nthe same as a part of his duty to care towards those visiting the theatre.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">112.  The second and equally important dimension relevant to the duty of  an\noccupier  of  a  cinema  theatre  concerns  the  statutory  provisions  that\nregulate  such  duties  and  make  certain  safety  measures  essential.  As\npreviously discussed, the effect of  such  statutory  provisions  where  the\nnature of care is specifically outlined is that an occupier cannot argue  in\ndefence that any danger arising out of violation  or  non-adherence  to  the\nprovisions of the  statute  was  not  reasonably  foreseeable  by  him.  The\ndecision of the House  of  Lords  in  Lochgelly’s  case  (supra)  succinctly\nexplains “the  effect  of  an  additional  statutory  burden  cast  upon  an\noccupier where a common law duty already exists.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_178\">113.  The third dimension that must also be constantly borne in  mind  while\ndetermining whether the occupier had breached his duty to care  towards  the\nsafety of the patrons is “that degree of care which an occupier is  required\nto take is commensurate with the risk created” as held by Lord Macmillan  in\nRead v. J. Lyons &amp; Co. Ltd.  [1947]  AC  156  and  an  earlier  decision  in\nGlasgow Corp v. Muir (1943) AC 448. The application of that  proposition  is\nappropriate in the case at hand where the installation of a DVB  transformer\nwithin the cinema premises had increased the degree of risk  on  account  of\nfire hazard which resultantly enhanced the degree of care  expected  of  the\noccupiers in maintenance of the safety measures  for  the  safety  of  those\ninside the theatre.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_179\">114.  Summarising the common law duty as  enhanced  and  reinforced  by  the\nprovisions of Cinematograph Act, 1952 and  the  DCR,  1953,  the  appellant-\nAnsal brothers as occupiers of the cinema were duty bound to take  care  and\nsuch care included the care to:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_170\">      (i)   To provide a seating arrangement which ensured  easy  access  to\n      exits to all patrons in the event of an emergency, wherever  they  may\n      be seated.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\">      (ii)  To provide vertical and horizontal gangways of appropriate width\n      along all sides of the auditorium/balcony as well as down  the  centre\n      of the seating accommodation  to  provide  convenient  access  to  the\n      exits.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_172\">      (iii) To provide an adequate  number  of  well-marked  exits  suitably\n      spaced along both sides of the auditorium/balcony and along  the  back\n      thereof, leading directly into at least two independent  thoroughfares\n      so as to provide speedy egress to the patrons.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_173\">      (iv)  To provide at least two stairways of adequate width  for  public\n      use, providing access to every upper floor in the building.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_174\">      (v)   To ensure that there was no  obstruction  in  the  gangways  and\n      other pathways to the exits, as well as the staircases leading to open\n      space.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_175\">      (vi)  To provide emergency lighting and well-lit exit signs for use in\n      the event of a power failure or other  emergency  in  order  to  guide\n      patrons from out of the dark.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_176\">      (vii) To put in place a working public address and/or alarm system  to\n      warn patrons in the event of any danger so that they may exit from the\n      premises without delay or loss of time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_177\">      (viii)      To provide an adequate number of fire extinguishers and/or\n      other fire-fighting equipment and to keep them readily  available  for\n      use in an emergency at all times.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_178\">      (ix)  To appoint an adequate number of torch men and persons in charge\n      of the fire-fighting equipment to be present throughout  the  duration\n      of a film exhibition to aid and guide patrons out of  the  theatre  as\n      and when such a need arises.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_179\">(viii) Whether the accused were negligent and if so, whether the negligence\n       was gross:\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_180\">115.  The Courts below have concurrently found that  the  occupiers  of  the\ncinema  building  had  committed  several  deviations  from  the  sanctioned\nbuilding plan apart from breaches of statutory provisions. These  deviations\nand breaches may not have directly contributed to the death of  the  victims\nin the instant case but the same cannot be said to be wholly irrelevant  for\npurposes of determining whether or not the  occupiers  had  neglected  their\nduty to care and if they had, whether such  neglect  was  gross  in  nature.\nThe concurrent findings of the Courts below  in  the  nature  of  deviations\nfrom  the  sanctioned  building  plan  of  the  cinema  and  the   statutory\nrequirements may be enumerated as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_180\">(1)   That the occupiers permitted the installation  of  a  DVB  transformer\nwithin the cinema premises, although the building plan did not  envisage  or\npermit  any  such  installation.  The   occupier’s   contention   that   the\ninstallation   of   the   transformer   was    under    coercion    remained\nunsubstantiated.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_181\">(2)    That  the  rear  parapet  wall  behind  the  transformer   room   was\nconstructed upto the ceiling height thereby  preventing  smoke  rising  from\nthe burning transformer oil and the cars parked in  the  parking  area  from\ndispersing into the open atmosphere.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_182\">(3)   That the stairway  leading  to  the  terrace  was  obstructed  by  the\ninstallation of a full width door  in  the  staircase  landing  as  well  as\nconstruction of a reception counter in the staircase leading to the  terrace\nby Sarin Associates  one of the tenants inducted by the owners.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_183\">(4)   That the exhaust fans opened into the staircase rather  than  into  an\nopen space thereby defeating the purpose of their installation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_184\">(5)   That a homeopathic dispensary was constructed above  the  ramp  behind\nthe transformer room which was found to be and described as  a  fire  hazard\nduring MCD inspections since 1983.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_185\">(6)That the staircase around the lift leading  to  the  basement  was  being\nused by M/s Sehgal Carpets by conversion of that area into an office was  an\nadditional hazard and against the sanctioned plan.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_186\">(7)   That the enclosure of the open space adjoining  the  transformer  room\nto be used as a ticket counter and the creation of a  glazed  verandah  next\nto the Manager’s room were also deviations from the building plan.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_187\">(8)         That conversion of the Operator room on the  second  floor  into\nan office-cum-bar room too was a deviation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_188\">(9)   That letting out  of  the  top  floor  as  office  space  with  wooden\npartitions was also a deviation and was pointed out to be  a  safety  hazard\nduring fire safety inspections.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_189\">(10)  That out of 22 fire  extinguishers  seized  after  the  incident  from\nvarious parts of the building including the  parking  lot  and  balcony,  10\nwere empty, 4 were not working properly while 1 was leaking  from  the  top.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_181\">This meant that only 7 of such extinguishers were in working condition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_182\">(11)  That neither the Projector  Operator  nor  any  other  person  present\nduring the exhibition of the cinematograph was trained in fire  fighting  as\nrequired in DCR 1953.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_183\">116.  The above deviations, it was rightly contended by Mr.  Jethmalani  did\nnot constitute the causa causans  for  the  death  of  the  victims  in  the\ninstant case.  Even so two  inferences  are  clearly  available  from  these\ndeviations namely (i) That the occupiers of the  cinema  building  were  not\nsensitive towards the demands of safety of  the  patrons  and  amply  showed\nthat the safety of the visitors to the theatre was a matter of low  priority\nfor the occupiers and (ii) That the deviations raised the level of  risk  to\nthe  safety  of  the  patrons  which  in  turn  required  the  occupiers  to\nproportionately raise the level of their vigil and the  degree  of  care  in\nregard to the safety of those visiting the cinema.  Instead of removing  the\ndeviations and the perceived fire hazards and thereby reducing the  risk  of\nexposing the patrons to avoidable dangers  to  their  safety  the  occupiers\ncommitted  several  breaches  that  directly  contributed  to  the  loss  of\nvaluable human lives.  For instance both the Courts have  concurrently  held\nthe following breaches to have been established, by the evidence adduced  by\nthe prosecution:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_190\">     1) That the cinema did not have any functional Public  Address  System\n        necessary to sound an alarm  in  the  event  of  a  fire  or  other\n        emergency.   The  PA  system  of  the  cinema  was  found   to   be\n        dysfunctional at the time of the occurrence hence could not be used\n        to warn or to sound an alarm to those inside  the  cinema  to  exit\n        from the hall and the balcony.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_191\">     2) That the emergency lighting even though  an  essential  requirement\n        and so also the well-lit exits stipulated under the DCR  1953  were\n        conspicuous by their absence.  The failure of the  electric  supply\n        on account of  tripping  of  the  main  supply  lines  consequently\n        plunged the cinema hall and the balcony area into darkness  leaving\n        those inside the balcony panic stricken and groping in the dark  to\n        find exits in which process they got fatally exposed to the  carbon\n        monoxide laden smoke that had filled the hall.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_192\">     3) That blocking of the vertical gangway along the rightmost wall  and\n        the narrowing of the vertical gangway along the right side  of  the\n        middle exit by installation of additional seats had the  effect  of\n        depriving the patrons of the facility to use the right side gangway\n        and the gangway along the middle exit for quick dispersal from  the\n        balcony\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_193\">     4) That the closure of the right side exit  in  the  balcony  area  by\n        installation of a private  eight-seater  box  permanently  cut  off\n        access to the right side staircase and thereby  violated  not  only\n        the DCR 1953 but also prevented the patrons from  using  that  exit\n        and the right side stairway for quick dispersal from the balcony.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_194\">     5) That the introduction of the new exit  in  the  left  wing  of  the\n        balcony in lieu of the closed right side exit did not make  up  for\n        the breach of Para  10  (4),  First  Schedule  of  DCR  1953  which\n        mandates that exits on both sides of the auditorium/balcony.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_195\">     6) That failure to introduce fourth exit even when the total number of\n        seats in the balcony had gone above 300 with  the  addition  of  15\n        more seats  installed  in  1980,  further  compromised  the  safety\n        requirements statutorily prescribed under the DCR.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_196\">     7) That bolting of the middle entry/exit doors leading into the  foyer\n        obstructed the flow of patrons out of the balcony exposing them  to\n        poisonous gas that spread into the hall for a  longer  period  then\n        what was safe for the patrons to survive.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_197\">     8) That the absence of any staff members to open the exit gates and to\n        generally assist the patrons in quick dispersal  from  the  balcony\n        resulted in the patrons inhaling poisonous gas and dying because of\n        asphyxiation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_198\">     9) That the bolting of the door leading from the foyer into the  right\n        side staircase and  outside  which  had  to  be  forced  open  also\n        prevented the  quick  dispersal  and  led  to  a  large  number  of\n        causalities.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_199\">    10) That construction of the refreshment counter near the exit gate  of\n        the first floor and another near the second  floor  inhibited  free\n        passage of the patrons.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_184\">117.  That the breaches enumerated above have been proved  by  the  evidence\nadduced at the trial is concluded by the  concurrent  findings  recorded  by\nthe two Courts below. There  is,  in  our  opinion,  no  perversity  in  the\nconclusions drawn by the Courts below on the aspects  enumerated  above.  In\nthe light of those conclusions it can be safely said that the occupiers  had\ncommitted a breach of their duty to care and were, therefore, negligent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_185\">118.  The  argument  that  the  incident  in  question  was  not  reasonably\nforeseeable must in the light of what is stated above be rejected. So  also,\nthe argument that since no untoward incident had  occurred  for  many  years\nprior to the occurrence that claimed so many lives, the same indicated  that\nthe occurrence was not reasonable foreseeable deserves to be mentioned  only\nto be rejected.  A similar contention had in  fact  been  rejected  by  this\nCourt even in Kurban Hussein’s case (supra), where this Court said :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_200\">                 “In particular it is urged that this  method  of  work  has\n           been going on for some years and no fire had broken out and this\n           shows that though there may have been possible danger  to  human\n           life from such fire or combustible matter there was no  probable\n           danger. We are unable to accept this contention. The  fact  that\n           there was no fire earlier in this room even though  the  process\n           had been going  on  for  some  years  is  not  a  criterion  for\n           determining whether the omission was such  as  would  result  in\n           probable danger to human life.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_186\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"190237958\" id=\"span_22\">119.  To the same effect is the observation made  by  this  Court  in  State\nthrough <a href=\"/doc/190237958/\" id=\"a_88\">PS Lodhi Colony, New Delhi v. Sanjeev Nanda</a> (2012) 8 SCC 450,  where\nthis Court held that just because the accused <a href=\"/doc/190237958/\" id=\"a_89\">in that case</a>  had  driven  for\nsixteen kilometers without any untoward incident did not by  itself  provide\nhim a defence, or prove his innocence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_187\">(viii) Whether the accused were negligent and if so, whether the  negligence\n        was gross:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_188\">120.  The question then is whether  the  negligence  of  Ansal  brothers-the\noccupiers of the cinema was so gross so as  to  be  culpable  under  <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_90\">Section\n304A</a> of the IPC. Our answer to that question  is  in  the  affirmative.  The\nreasons are not far to  seek.   In  the  first  place  the  degree  of  care\nexpected from an occupier  of  a  place  which  is  frequented  everyday  by\nhundreds and if not thousands is very high in comparison to any other  place\nthat is less frequented or more sparingly used for public functions  .   The\nhigher the number of visitors to a place and the greater  the  frequency  of\nsuch visits, the higher would be the degree of care required to be  observed\nfor  their  safety.   The  duty  is  continuing  which  starts  with   every\nexhibition of cinematograph and continues till the patrons safely exit  from\nthe cinema complex. That the patrons  are  admitted  to  the  cinema  for  a\nprice, makes them contractual invitees or visitors  qua  whom  the  duty  to\ncare is even otherwise higher than others. The need for high degree of  care\nfor the safety of the visitors to such public places offering  entertainment\nis evident from the fact that the Parliament has enacted  the  <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_91\">Cinematograph\nAct</a>  and   the   Rules,   which   cast   specific   obligations   upon   the\nowners/occupiers/licensees with a view  to  ensuring  the  safety  of  those\nfrequenting such places. The annual inspections and the requirements  of  No\nObjection Certificates to be obtained  from  authorities  concerned  is  yet\nanother indicator of how important the  law  considers  the  safety  of  the\npatrons to be.  Any question as to the nature and the extent of breach  must\ntherefore be seen in the backdrop of the above duties and  obligations  that\narise both under the common law and the statutory provisions  alike.  Judged\nin the above backdrop it is evident that the occupiers in the  present  case\nhad showed scant regard both for the letter of law as also their duty  under\nthe common law to care for the safety of their patrons.  The  occupiers  not\nonly committed deviations from the sanctioned building plan that  heightened\nthe dangers to the safety of the  visitors  but  continued  to  operate  the\ncinema in contemptuous disregard for the requirements of law in the  process\nexposing the patrons to a high degree of risk to their lives which  some  of\nthem eventually lost in the incident  in  question.   Far  from  taking  any\nadditional care towards safety of the visitors to the cinema  the  occupiers\nasked for permission to place additional seats that further compromised  the\nsafety requirements and raised the  level  of  risks  to  the  patrons.  The\nhistory of litigation  between  the  occupiers  on  the  one  hand  and  the\nGovernment on the other  regarding  the  removal  of  the  additional  seats\npermitted during national emergency and their  opposition  to  the  concerns\nexpressed by the authorities on account of increased fire  hazards  as  also\ntheir insistence that the addition or continuance of  the  seats  would  not\naffect the safety requirements of the patrons clearly showed that they  were\nmore concerned with making a little more money out  of  the  few  additional\nseats that were added to the cinema in the balcony rather  than  maintaining\nthe required standards of safety in discharge of the  common  law  duty  but\nalso under the provisions of the DCR 1953.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_189\">(ix) Further contentions urged in defence and findings thereon:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_190\">121.  Appearing for the appellant Sushil Ansal, Mr.  Jethmalani  strenuously\nargued that the death of 59 persons in the incident in question  was  caused\nby the fire  that  started  from  the  DVB  transformer,  which  was  poorly\nmaintained and shabbily repaired by the DVB  officials  on  the  morning  of\n13th June, 1997 the date of incident.  The causa causans  for  the  loss  of\nhuman lives thus was  the  transformer  that  caught  fire  because  of  the\nneglect of the DVB officials who did not even have  a  crimping  machine  to\nrepair the transformer properly. The absence of an oil soaking  pit  in  the\ntransformer room was also a reason  for  the  oil  to  spill  out  from  the\ntransformer room to spread the fire to the parking  area  from  where  smoke\ncontaining lethal carbon monoxide rose, and due to chimney  effect,  entered\nthe hall to cause asphyxiation to those inside the balcony.  He  urged  that\nthere was no evidence that any death had  taken  place  inside  the  balcony\nwhich proved that most if not all the patrons sitting  in  the  balcony  had\nexited from that area, but died on account of the poisonous  effect  of  the\ngas enough to kill human being within minutes of exposure.   Heavy  reliance\nwas placed by Mr. Jethmalani upon the  decision  of  this  Court  in  Kurban\nHussein’s case (supra) in support of his submission that the  causa  causans\nin the case at hand was the fire in the DVB transformer and not the  alleged\ndeviations  in  the  building  plan  or  the  seating  arrangement  or   the\nobstructions in the staircase, that led out of the cinema precincts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_191\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1097044\" id=\"span_23\">122.  Mr.  Harish  Salve,  appearing  for  the  CBI  and  Mr.  K.T.S.  Tulsi\nappearing for the Victims Association contended  that  while  there  was  no\nquarrel with the proposition that death must be shown to have occurred as  a\ndirect, immediate or proximate result of the act of rashness or  negligence,\nit was not correct to say that the deaths in this case had occurred  because\nof the fire in the transformer.   It  was  also  not  correct  to  draw  any\nanalogy on facts with any  other  decided  case  including  that  of  <a href=\"/doc/1097044/\" id=\"a_92\">Kurban\nHussein</a> (supra).  Failure of the victims to  rapidly  exit  from  the  smoke\nfilled  atmosphere  in  the  balcony  area  because  of   obstructions   and\ndeviations proved at the trial was the real, direct and immediate cause  for\nthe death of the victims in the present case who would have  safely  escaped\nthe poisonous carbon monoxide  gas  only  if  there  were  proper  gangways,\nexits, emergency lights, an alarm system  in  working  condition  and  human\nassistance available to those trapped inside the hall.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_192\">123.  We have at some length  dealt  with  the  ingredients  of  an  offence\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 304A</a> of  the  IPC  in  the  earlier  part  of  this\njudgment. One of those ingredients indeed is that the rash or negligent  act\nof the accused ought to be the direct, immediate and proximate cause of  the\ndeath.  We have in that regard referred to the decisions of  this  Court  to\nwhich we need not refer again.  The principle of  law  that  death  must  be\nshown to be the direct, immediate  and  proximate  result  of  the  rash  or\nnegligent act is well accepted and not in issue before  us  as  an  abstract\nproposition. What is argued and what falls for our determination is  whether\nthe causa causans in the case at hand was the fire in  the  DVB  transformer\nas argued by the defence or the failure of the victims to rapidly exit  from\nthe balcony area.  Two aspects in this connection need  be  borne  in  mind.\nThe first is that the victims in the  instant  case  did  not  die  of  burn\ninjuries.  All of them died because of asphyxiation on account of  prolonged\nexposure to poisonous gases  that  filled  the  cinema  hall  including  the\nbalcony area.  Fire, whatever may have been its  source,  whether  from  the\nDVB transformer or otherwise, was the causa sine qua non  for  without  fire\nthere would be no smoke possible and but  for  smoke  in  the  balcony  area\nthere would have been no casualities.  That is not, however, the same  thing\nas saying that it was the fire or the resultant smoke  that  was  the  causa\ncausans. It was the inability of the  victims  to  move  out  of  the  smoke\nfilled area that was the direct cause of their death.   Placed  in  a  smoke\nfilled atmosphere any one would distinctively try to escape from it to  save\nhimself.  If such escape were to be delayed or prevented the  causa  causans\nfor death is not the smoke but  the  factors  that  prevent  or  delay  such\nescape.  Let us assume for  instance  that  even  when  there  are  adequate\nnumber of exits, gangways and all other safety measures  in  place  but  the\nexits are locked preventing people from escaping. The cause of  death  would\nin such case be the act of preventing people from  exiting  from  the  smoke\nfilled hall, which may depending  upon  whether  the  act  was  deliberately\nintended to cause death or unintended due to negligence, amount to  culpable\nhomicide amounting to murder or an act of gross negligence punishable  under\nSection 304A.  Similarly take a case where instead of  four  exits  required\nunder the relevant Rules, the owner of a  cinema  provides  only  one  exit,\nwhich prevents the patrons  from  exiting  rapidly  from  the  smoke  filled\natmosphere, the causa causans would be the negligent act of  providing  only\none exit instead of four required for the purpose.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_193\">124.  It would in such circumstances make no  difference  whether  the  fire\nhad started from a source within the cinema complex or outside,  or  whether\nthe occupiers of the cinema were responsible for the fire or  someone  else.\nThe important question to ask is what the immediate cause of the death  was.\n If failure to exit was the immediate cause of death  nothing  further  need\nbe considered for that would constitute the  causa  causans.  That  is  what\nhappened in the case at hand. Smoke entered the cinema hall and the  balcony\nbut escape was prevented or at  least  delayed  because  of  breach  of  the\ncommon law and statutory duty to care.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_194\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1528053\" id=\"span_24\">125.  The second aspect is that while the  rash  or  negligent  act  of  the\naccused must be the causa causans for the death, the  question  whether  and\nif so what was the causa causans in a given  case,  would  depend  upon  the\nfact situation in which the occurrence has  taken  place  and  the  question\narises. This Court has viewed the causa causans in  each  decided  case,  in\nthe facts and circumstances of that case.  If Hatim’s failure  to  stir  the\nhot wet paint while Rosin was being poured into it  was  held  to  be  causa\ncausans, in Kurban Hussein’s case (supra), the failure of  the  motorist  to\nlook ahead and see a pedestrian crossing the road  even  when  the  motorist\nwas driving within the speed limit prescribed  was  held  to  be  the  causa\ncausans for the death in <a href=\"/doc/1528053/\" id=\"a_94\">Bhalchandra Waman Pathe  v.  State  of  Maharashtra</a>\n(supra).</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1748452\" id=\"span_25\">In <a href=\"/doc/1748452/\" id=\"a_95\">Bhalchandra @ Bapu and Anr. v.  State  of  Maharashtra</a>  (supra)\nwhere an explosion in a factory manufacturing crackers claimed  lives,  this\nCourt found that use of  explosives  with  sensitive  compositions  was  the\nimmediate cause of the explosion that killed those working in  the  factory.\nIn Rustom Sherior Irani’s case (supra), this Court found the new chimney  of\nthe Bakery was being erected without the  advice  of  a  properly  qualified\nperson and that the factory owner was responsible for  neglect  that  caused\nthe explosion and not the mason employed by him for  erecting  the  chimney.\nThe decision in Kurban Hussein’s  case (supra) was cited  but  distinguished\non facts holding that the choice of the low diameter  pipe  and  engaging  a\nmere mason not properly qualified for doing the job were the  cause  of  the\naccident resulting in causalities.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_195\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"581928\" id=\"span_26\">126. It is in that view, not correct to say that the causa  causans  in  the\npresent case ought to be determined by matching the  colours  of  this  case\nwith those of Kurban Hussein’s case (supra).  The ratio of  that  case  lies\nnot in the peculiar facts in which the question arose but on  the  statement\nof law which was borrowed from the  judgment  of  Sir  Lawrence  Jenkins  in\n<a href=\"/doc/581928/\" id=\"a_96\">Emperor v. Omkar Rampratap</a> (supra).  The  principle  of  law  enunciated  <a href=\"/doc/581928/\" id=\"a_97\">in\nthat case</a> is not under challenge and  indeed  was  fairly  conceded  by  Mr.\nSalve and Mr. Tulsi. What they argued was that when  applied  to  the  facts\nproved in the present case, the causa  causans  was  not  the  fire  in  the\ntransformer but the breaches committed by the occupiers of the cinema  which\nprevented or at  least  delayed  rapid  dispersal  of  the  patrons  thereby\nfatally affecting them because of carbon monoxide laden  gas  in  the  smoke\nfilling the atmosphere.  The causa causans indeed was  the  closure  of  the\nexit on the right side, the closure of the right side gangway,  the  failure\nto provide the required number of exits, failure to provide emergency  alarm\nsystem and even emergency lights or to keep the exit signs  illuminated  and\nto provide help  to  the  victims  when  they  needed  the  same  most,  all\nattributable to Ansal brothers,  the  occupiers  of  the  cinema.  We  have,\ntherefore, no hesitation in rejecting the argument of Mr. Jethmalani,  which\nhe presented with commendable clarity, persuasive skill and tenacity at  his\ncommand.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_196\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"79832126\" id=\"span_27\">127.  Mr. Jethamalani next argued that since the licensing authority had  on\nthe  basis  of  the  no  objection  certificates  issued  by  the  concerned\nauthorities granted and from time to time renewed the  Cinema  licence,  the\nappellant-Ansal brothers were protected under <a href=\"/doc/1918278/\" id=\"a_98\">Section  79</a>  of  the  IPC  for\nthey in good faith believed themselves to be justified in law in  exhibiting\nfilms with the seating and other  arrangements  sanctioned  under  the  said\nlicence.   Reliance  in  support  of  that  submission  was  placed  by  Mr.\nJethmalani, upon the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/79832126/\" id=\"a_99\">Raj Kapoor v.  Laxman</a>  (1980)\n2 SCC 175.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_197\">128.  Mr. Tulsi on the contrary argued that reliance upon <a href=\"/doc/1918278/\" id=\"a_100\">Section 79</a> of  the\nIPC and the decision of this Court in Raj Kapoor’s case  (supra)  misplaced.\nHe urged that immunity from penal action under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1918278/\" id=\"a_101\">Section  79</a>\nof the IPC was founded on good faith which was totally absent  in  the  case\nat hand  where  the  occupiers  of  the  cinema  and  even  those  who  were\ninstrumental in the grant and renewal of the licence and no objections  were\naccused and even convicted by the Courts below.  There  was,  therefore,  no\nquestion of the appellants taking  shelter  under  the  licence,  the  terms\nwhereof were in any case breached by them to the  misfortune  of  those  who\nlost their lives in the incident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_198\">129.  <a href=\"/doc/1918278/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 79</a> of the IPC may, at this stage, be extracted:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_201\">1 “Section 79. Act done by  a  person  justified,  or  by  mistake  of  fact\n           believing himself justified, by law  -  Nothing  is  an  offence\n           which is done by any person who is justified by law, or  who  by\n           reason of a mistake of fact and not by reason of  a  mistake  of\n           law in good faith, believes himself to be justified by  law,  in\n           doing it.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_199\">130.  A reading of the above shows that nothing would constitute an  offence\nunder the IPC if the act done is:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_202\">           i) Justified in law,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_203\">          ii) The act is done by a person who by reason  of  a  mistake  of\n              fact in good faith believes himself to be justified by law in\n              doing it.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_200\">131.  In the case at hand the defence relies upon  the  latter  of  the  two\nsituations, in which the benefit of penal immunity  will  flow  if  (a)  the\nperson doing the act is acting under a mistake of fact and  (b)  the  person\ndoing the act in good faith believes himself  to  be  justified  by  law  in\ndoing it.  The expression ‘good faith’ is defined in <a href=\"/doc/1180351/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 52</a> of  the  IPC\nas under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_204\">           “52. “Good faith”.-- Nothing is said to be done  or  believed  in\n           “good faith” which is done  or  believed  without  due  care  and\n           attention.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_201\">132.  In order that Ansal brothers, occupiers of the cinema could claim  the\nbenefit of Section 79, they were required to prove  that  the  belief  which\nthey harboured about their act being justified in law  was  in  good  faith.\nThe use of expression  ‘good  faith’  necessarily  brings  in  the  question\nwhether the person concerned had acted with due care and caution.   If  they\nhad not, part (b) of Section 79 would have no application to the case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_202\">133.  The duty to care for the safety of the patrons, we have  explained  in\nthe earlier part, was cast upon the Ansal brothers occupiers of  the  cinema\nboth in common law as also in terms of statutory provisions on the  subject.\n We have  also  held  that  the  evidence  adduced  at  the  trial  and  the\nconcurrent findings recorded by the  Courts  below,  have,  established  the\nbreach of that duty in  several  respects.   For  instance  absence  of  any\nPublic Address System to warn those inside the cinema in the  event  of  any\nemergency was in the facts and circumstances of the case a part of the  duty\nto care which was breached by the occupiers.  This  duty  was  a  continuing\nobligation and had to be strictly discharged in respect of each cinema  show\nconducted in the theatre. The grant of a  licence  or  its  renewal  by  the\nlicensing authority did not in any manner  relieve  the  occupiers  of  that\nobligation which was implicit even in the grant and  the  renewals  thereof.\nSimilarly, the requirement that the cinema must have emergency lights,  fire\nextinguishers and that the occupiers must provide help  to  the  patrons  in\nthe event of any emergency ensuring rapid dispersal from the  enclosed  area\nwere obligations that too were implicit in the  issue  and  renewal  of  the\ncinematograph  licence.  Breach  of  all  these  obligations  could  not  be\njustified on the ground that a licence was granted or renewed in  favour  of\nthe occupiers, licensee and no matter the duty to  care  towards  safety  of\nthe patrons was neglected by the theatre owners or  occupiers.  Failures  in\nthe event of a mishap like the one at hand on  account  of  failure  of  the\noccupiers to discharge their legal obligations to take care for  the  safety\nof the patrons cannot be held to be immune from prosecution  simply  because\na licence to exhibit the films had been granted  or  renewed  from  time  to\ntime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_203\">134.  The  argument  that  the  seating  arrangement  in  the  balcony,  the\nplacement of the gangways, the number and  the  positioning  of  the  exits,\nwere matters which were examined and approved by  the  concerned  authority,\nthereby entitling the occupiers to a bona fide and good  faith  belief  that\nthey were on the right side of law,  no  doubt  looks  attractive  on  first\nblush but does not stand closer scrutiny.  The essence of Section  79  is  a\nbelief entertained in good faith about the legitimacy of what is being  done\nby the person concerned.  Absence of good faith is enough  to  deny  to  him\nthe benefit that he  claims.  Good  faith  has  in  turn  to  be  proved  by\nreference to the attendant circumstances.  That is because good faith  is  a\nstate of mind which can be inferred only from the circumstances  surrounding\nthe act in question. The test of ordinary prudence applied  to  such  proved\nattendant circumstances can help the  Court  determine  whether  an  act  or\nomission was in good faith or otherwise. Having said that, we  would  simply\nrecall our findings recorded earlier that  the  fundamental  obligation  and\nduty to care at all times rested with the occupiers of the  cinema  and  the\nlicensee thereof.  In the discharge of that  duty  the  occupiers  were  not\nentitled to argue that so long as there was a license in their favour,  they\nwould not be accountable for the loss of life or limb  of  anyone  qua  whom\nthe occupiers owed that duty. The  duty  to  care  for  the  safety  of  the\npatrons, even independent of the  statutory  additions  made  to  the  same,\nrequired the occupiers to take all such steps and measures,  as  would  have\nensured quick dispersal from the cinema building of all the  patrons  inside\nthe premises in the event of an emergency. The statutory requirements  were,\nin that sense, only additional safeguards which  in  no  way  mitigated  the\ncommon law duty to care, the degree of such care or the manner in which  the\nsame was to be discharged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_204\">135.  That apart, a seating plan, which  was  in  breach  of  the  statutory\nprovisions and compromised the safety requirements prescribed under the  DCR\n1953, could hardly support a belief in good faith that exhibition  of  films\nwith such a plan was legally justified.  That  is  so  especially  when  the\nrepeal of notification dated  30th  September,  1976  by  which  Uphaar  was\npermitted 100 more seats was  followed  by  a  demand  for  removal  of  the\nadditional seats.  Instead of doing so the  occupiers/owners  assailed  that\ndemand in Writ Petition No.1010 of 1979 before the High Court  of  Delhi  in\nwhich the High Court directed the authorities to have a fresh look from  the\nstand  point  of  substantial  compliance   of   the   provisions   of   the\n<a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_104\">Cinematograph Act</a>. The High Court observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_205\">           “11. Proposition No. 3: It has been  already  made  clear  above\n           that the relaxation was granted  after  considering  the  public\n           health and the fire hazard aspects. It is also  clear  that  the\n           very fact that the relaxation could not be granted after bearing\n           these main considerations in mind would show that there was some\n           rule for the extension of the  sitting  accommodation  in  these\n           theatres within the Rules, though the provision of some  of  the\n           additional seats may perhaps have been to some  extent  contrary\n           to some of the Rules. It is not necessary for us to speculate on\n           this question. It is enough  to  say  that  the  result  of  the\n           cancellation of the relaxation is simply the withdrawal  of  the\n           relaxation.  It  does  not  automatically  mean  that  all   the\n           additional seats which were installed  in  the  cinema  theatres\n           were contrary to the Rules and must,  therefore,  be  dismantled\n           without any consideration as to how many of these seats were  in\n           consonance with the Rules and how many of them were contrary  to\n           the Rules.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_206\">           12. Our finding on proposition No. 3  is,  therefore,  that  the\n           Administration will apply their mind  to  the  additional  seats\n           with a view to determine which of them  have  contravened  which\n           rules and to what extent.  They  will  bear  in  mind  that  the\n           compliance with the Rules is to be substantial and not rigid and\n           inflexible.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_205\">136.  If while carrying out the above directive, the  authorities  concerned\nturned a blind eye to the fundamental requirement of the Rules  by  ignoring\nthe closure of the right side exit and gangway prescribed  as  an  essential\nrequirement under DCR 1953, they acted in breach of the  rules  and  in  the\nprocess endangered the safety of the patrons. We  shall  presently  turn  to\nthe question whether the repeal  of  the  notification  had  the  effect  of\nobliging the occupier/licensee  of  the  cinema  to  remove  the  seats  and\nrestore the gangways and exits as  originally  sanctioned.   But  we  cannot\nignore the fact that the occupiers/licensee of the cinema, had  opposed  the\nremoval of the additional seats  even  when  the  respondents  in  the  writ\npetition had expressed concerns about the  safety  of  the  patrons  if  the\nadditional seats were not removed which removal it is evident would have  by\nitself resulted in the restoration of the right side gangway.  So  also  the\nauthorities ought to have insisted on the  restoration  of  the  right  side\nexit by removal of the eight-seater box which was allowed in the year  1978,\nostensibly because with the right side gangway getting closed by  additional\nseats occupying that space the authorities  considered  the  continuance  of\nthe right side exit to be of no practical use.  Withdrawal of relaxation  in\nthe year 1979 ought to have resulted in the reversal of not only the  fixing\nof additional seats but all  subsequent  decisions  that  proceeded  on  the\nbasis thereof. It is difficult to appreciate how even applying the  test  of\nsubstantial compliance the authorities could  consider  the  theatre  to  be\ncompliant with the DCR 1953 especially in so far as the same related  to  an\nimportant aspect like gangways and exits so very vital for speedy  dispersal\nfrom the cinema hall.  To add further confusion to the  already  compromised\nsafety situation, the occupiers asked for addition of 15 more seats  in  the\nyear 1980, which were also allowed,  taking  the  number  of  seats  in  the\nbalcony to 302, thereby, raising the requirement of exits from  3  to  4  in\nterms of para 10(2) of the First Schedule to  DCR  1953.   This  requirement\nwas not relaxable under proviso to  Rule  3(3)  of  DCR  1953  and  yet  the\nauthorities gave a go by to the same in the process, permitting yet  another\nbreach that had the potential and did actually prove to be a  safety  hazard\nfor those inside the theatre  on  the  fateful  day.  It  is  in  the  above\nbackdrop difficult to accept the submission of the appellant occupiers  that\nthey acted in good faith and are, therefore, protected  against  prosecution\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1918278/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 79</a> of the IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_206\">137.  There is yet another angle from which  the  matter  can  be  examined.\nProviso to <a href=\"/doc/1120161/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 5A</a> of the Cinematograph Act, 1952 protects the  applicant\nseeking issue of a certificate, the distributor and the  exhibitor  as  also\nany other person to whom the rights in the  film  may  have  passed  against\npunishment under any law relating to obscenity  in  respect  of  any  matter\ncontained in the film  for  which  a  certificate  has  been  granted  under\nclauses  (a)  or  (b)  of  sub-section  (1)  to  <a href=\"/doc/1120161/\" id=\"a_107\">Section  5A</a>.    It   reads:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_207\">           “Provided  that  the  applicant   for   the   certificate,   any\n           distributor or exhibitor or any other person to whom the  rights\n           in the film have passed shall not be liable for punishment under\n           any law relating to obscenity in respect of any matter contained\n           in the film for which certificate has been granted under  clause\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_208\">           (a) or clause (b)”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_207\">138.   The above was added by Act 49 of 1981  with  effect  from  1st  June,\n1983. The  decision  in  Raj  Kapoor’s  case  (supra)  relied  upon  by  Mr.\nJethmalani was earlier in point of time and is distinguishable  because  the\nquestion there related to the effect of a certificate issued  under  <a href=\"/doc/1120161/\" id=\"a_108\">Section\n5A</a> vis-à-vis the prosecution of the producer,  director  or  the  holder  of\ncertificate for obscenity punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1704109/\" id=\"a_109\">Section 292</a> of  the  IPC  or  any\nother law for that matter.  The  addition  of  proviso  to  <a href=\"/doc/397748/\" id=\"a_110\">Section  5A  (1)\n(supra)</a> in any case sets the controversy at rest and grants immunity to  the\nperson exhibiting a film to the public in accordance  with  the  certificate\nissued by the board.  No such protection against  prosecution  is,  however,\navailable to the holder of a cinema licence against prosecution for  a  rash\nor negligent act resulting in the death of anyone visiting  the  cinema  and\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_111\">Section 304A</a> of  the  IPC.  In  the  absence  of  any  such\nprotection against prosecution  for  rash  or  negligent  act  resulting  in\ndeath,  unlike  the  protection  that  the  statute  itself  grants  against\nprosecution for obscenity, is a circumstance that strongly suggests that  no\nsuch protection was intended to be given to a  licence  holder  against  any\nsuch  prosecution.   The  argument  that  absence  of  any  such  protection\nnotwithstanding the occupiers/owners of  the  cinema  may  be  protected  in\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/1918278/\" id=\"a_112\">Section 79</a> of the IPC is obviously founded on  the  plea  that  the\nappellants were under a “mistake of fact” when they in good  faith  believed\nthemselves to be justified in law in exhibiting films  in  the  theatre,  by\nreason of a license issued under the Act. The plea that the appellants  were\nunder a ‘mistake of fact’, however, remains  unsubstantiated.   The  concept\nof mistake of fact has been explained by Russel on Crime  in  the  following\nwords:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_209\">           “When a person is ignorant of the existence of  relevant  facts,\n           or mistaken as to them, his conduct may produce harmful  results\n           which he neither intended nor foresaw.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_210\">             xxx                  xxx              xxx\n\n\n           Mistake can be admitted as a defence provided (1) that the state\n           of things believed to exist would, if true, have  justified  the\n           act done, and (2) the mistake must be reasonable, and  (3)  that\n           the mistake relates to fact and not to law.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_208\">139.  Ratanlal and Dhirajlal in their book “Law of Crimes” (23rd Edn.)  Page\n199 similarly explains the term “mistake” in the following words:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_211\">           “&#x27;Mistake&#x27; is not mere forgetfulness. It is a slip &#x27;made, not by\n           design, but by mischance&#x27;. Mistake,  as  the  term  is  used  in\n           jurisprudence, is an erroneous mental condition,  conception  or\n           conviction   induced   by    ignorance,    misapprehension    or\n           misunderstanding of the truth, and  resulting  in  some  act  or\n           omission done or suffered erroneously by  one  or  both  of  the\n           parties to a transaction, but without  its  erroneous  character\n           being intended or known at that time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_212\">                 It may be laid down as  a  general  rule  that  an  alleged\n           offender is deemed to have acted  under  that  state  of  things\n           which he in good faith and on  reasonable  grounds  believed  to\n           exist when he did the act alleged to be an offence.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_213\">140.  In the case at hand, the appellants-occupiers of the cinema, have  not\nbeen in a position to identify  the  facts  qua  which  they  were  under  a\nmistake nor is it clear as to how  any  such  mistake  of  fact  would  have\njustified their act in law, leave alone satisfy  the  third  requirement  of\nthe mistake of fact being reasonable in nature.  The  three  tests  referred\nto by Russel in the passage extracted above are  not,  therefore,  satisfied\nin the case at hand to entitle the appellant occupiers  to  the  benefit  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1918278/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 79</a> of the IPC.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_214\">141.  Mr. Jethmalani next contended  that  the  withdrawal  of  notification\ndated  30th  September,  1976  did  not  have  the  effect  of  creating  an\nobligation for the occupiers of the cinema to remove  the  additional  seats\nthat had been permitted under the said notification.   In  support  of  that\nsubmission, he placed reliance upon <a href=\"/doc/1030013/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 6</a> of the  General  Clauses  Act,\n1897 and two decisions of this Court which  according  to  him  support  the\nproposition that the principles underlying <a href=\"/doc/128634/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 6</a> are attracted  even  to\nnotifications no matter <a href=\"/doc/128634/\" id=\"a_116\">Section 6</a> does not in terms apply.  Elaborating  his\nsubmission Mr. Jethmalani contended that the repeal  of  an  enactment  does\nnot affect the previous operation of any such  enactment  or  anything  duly\ndone  or  suffered  thereunder.  On  the  same   principle   withdrawal   of\nnotification  dated  30th  September,  1976  could  not,  according  to  Mr.\nJethmalani, affect the  previous  operation  of  the  said  notification  or\nanything duly done or suffered thereunder.  This, contended Mr.  Jethmalani,\nimplied that  additional  seats  permitted  under  notification  dated  30th\nSeptember, 1976 could continue in the theatre, no  matter  the  notification\nunder which they were permitted was withdrawn.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_215\">142.  We regret our inability to accept that line of reasoning.  We  say  so\nfor reasons more than one. In the first  place  <a href=\"/doc/1030013/\" id=\"a_117\">Section  6</a>  of  the  General\nClauses Act does not, in our opinion, have any application to repeal of  any\nrule, notification or order.

Secondly, because the  decisions  in  <a href=\"/doc/593401/\" id=\"a_130\">State  of  Orissa  and  Ors.  v.\nTitaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd. and Anr.</a> (1985) Supp  SCC  280  and  Union  of\nIndia v. Glaxo India Ltd. and Anr. (2011)  6  SCC  668  do  not  extend  the\napplication of <a href=\"/doc/128634/\" id=\"a_131\">Section 6</a> to statutory notifications  as  was  sought  to  be\nargued by Mr. Jethmalani.  In Titaghur Paper Mills Co. Ltd.’s case  (supra),\nthis Court was dealing with the supersession of notifications  issued  under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/163057486/\" id=\"a_132\">Orissa Sales Tax Act</a> on the tax liability  accrued  under  the  repealed\nnotification.  Although this Court  held  that  a  tax  liability  that  was\nalready incurred under the repealed notifications  would  remain  unaffected\nby the repeal of the notification the decision does not go to the extent  of\nholding that  <a href=\"/doc/1030013/\" id=\"a_133\">Section  6</a>  of  the  General  Clauses  Act  or  the  principle\nunderlying the said provisions  would  be  attracted  to  such  repeal.  The\nreasoning for the conclusion of this Court, it appears, is  based  on  first\nprinciples more than <a href=\"/doc/128634/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 6</a> or its relevance to the  question  of  repeal\nof a notification. This is evident from the following passage from the  said\ndecision:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_227\">           “66…By repealing and replacing  the  previous  notifications  by\n           other  notifications,  the  result  was  not  to  wipe  out  any\n           liability accrued under  the  previous  notifications.  If  this\n           contention of the Respondents were to be  accepted,  the  result\n           would be startling. It would mean,  for  example,  that  when  a\n           notification has been issued under <a href=\"/doc/386530/\" id=\"a_135\">Section  5(1)</a>  prescribing  a\n           rate of tax,  and  that  notification  is  later  superseded  by\n           another notification further enhancing the rate of tax, all  tax\n           liability under the earlier notification is wiped out and no tax\n           can be collected by the  State  Government  in  respect  of  any\n           transactions  effected  during  the  period  when  the   earlier\n           notification was in force.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_215\">146.  In Glaxo India Ltd.‘s case (supra), all that this Court  declared  was\nthat the effect of a superseding notification would have  to  be  determined\non a proper construction of the notification itself and not  by  any  single\nprinciple or legal consideration.  The decision mentioned <a href=\"/doc/1030013/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 6</a>  of  the\nGeneral Clauses Act only to state that it would not apply to  notifications.\nThis is evident from the following passage from the said decision:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_228\">           “39…The view of this Court in some of the decisions is that  the\n           expression &quot;supersession&quot; has to be  understood  to  amount  &#x27;to\n           repeal&#x27; and when notification is  repealed,  the  provisions  of\n           <a href=\"/doc/1030013/\" id=\"a_137\">Section 6</a> of  the  General  Clauses  Act  would  not  apply   to\n           notifications.  The  question  whether   statutory   obligations\n           subsist in respect of a period prior to repeal of a provision of\n           a Statute or any subordinate legislation promulgated  thereunder\n           has to be ascertained on legal considerations  apposite  to  the\n           particular  context.  The   matter   is   essentially   one   of\n           construction. Such problems do not admit of  being  answered  on\n           the basis of any single principle or legal consideration.”\n\n\n\n\n                                           (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_216\">147.  Thirdly, because the effect of withdrawal of the notification  in  the\ninstant case may have to be seen and  determined  on  first  principles.  We\nfind it difficult to appreciate how the power to  withdraw  a  notification,\nthe existence whereof was  not  disputed  by  Mr.  Jethmalani  would  remain\nmeaningful and could be effectively exercised if the withdrawal  of  such  a\nnotification was to leave the benefit  under  the  notification  flowing  in\nperpetuity. The notification in question permitted additional  seats  to  be\nfixed in relaxation of the rules and, if the argument of Mr. Jethmalani  was\nto  be  accepted,  such  relaxation  and  fixation  of  seats  would  become\nirreversible even when the Government could legitimately exercise the  power\nto recall such a relaxation.  This would be anomalous  and  would  have  the\neffect of emasculating the power of  recall  itself.   The  power  would  be\nmeaningful and so also its exercise, only if the same  could  undo  whatever\nhad already been done under it prospectively. Such an  interpretation  would\nnot only recognize the power of withdrawal but  also  protect  the  previous\noperation of the repealed notification no matter limited to the extent  that\nthe occupiers had benefitted by fixation of such  seats  and  collection  of\nthe price of the tickets sold upto the date of withdrawal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_217\">148.  Last but  not  the  least  is  the  fact  that  the  question  whether\nwithdrawal of notification dated 30th September, 1976 would have the  effect\nof obliging the occupiers to remove the additional seats could and ought  to\nhave been argued before the High Court in the writ  petition  filed  by  the\noccupiers/owners of cinema hall, in Isherdas Sahni &amp; Bros and  Anr.  v.  The\nDelhi Administration and Ors.  AIR 1980 Delhi 147.  No such contention  was,\nhowever, urged before the High Court in support  of  the  challenge  to  the\ndemand for the removal of the seats  which  demand  was  based  entirely  on\nassumption that the withdrawal of the notification has  had  the  effect  of\nobliging the owners/occupiers to restore status quo  ante.  The  High  Court\ntook the view that recall of the notification would call for  a  review  qua\neach cinema hall to determine whether  the  continuance  of  the  seats  was\nsubstantially compliant with DCR, 1953. The High Court accordingly  directed\nthe authorities concerned  to  have  a  fresh  look  applying  the  test  of\nsubstantial   compliance   while   determining   the   liability   of    the\nowners/occupiers to remove the additional  seats.   The  occupiers  accepted\nthat direction. An exercise was accordingly undertaken though in  our  view,\nunsatisfactorily, for the authorities concerned  failed  to  look  into  the\nsafety requirements which ought to have been given  foremost  importance  in\nany such process.  The least, therefore,  that  can  be  said  is  that  the\nargument that no obligation arose to remove the additional seats  by  reason\nof the repeal of the notification dated 30th September,  1976  is  untenable\nnot only on merits, but also because the same  is  no  longer  available  in\nview of what has been stated above, and the fact that  the  question  stands\nconcluded by the judgment of this Court in Isherdas  Sahni’s  case  (supra).\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_218\">149.  We may at this stage deal with a  threefold  submission  made  by  Mr.\nJethmalani.  He contended that the appellant Ansal  Brothers  were  entitled\nto assume that the licensing authority  had  done  its  duty  and  satisfied\nitself about the premises being  adequately  safe  for  those  visiting  the\nsame.  Reliance in support of the submission  was  made  by  Mr.  Jethmalani\nupon the English decisions in Green v. Fibreglass Ltd.  1958  (2)  QBD  245,\nGee v. The Metropolitan Railway Company 1873 VIII Q.B. 161 and Grant v.  Sun\nShipping Co. Ltd. and Anr. 1948 AC 549.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_219\">150.  The second  limb  of  Mr.  Jethmalani’s  contention  was  that  having\ndelegated their duties to persons like R.M.  Puri  whole-time  Director  and\nthe Managers employed for ensuring safety of those visiting the cinema,  the\nAnsal brothers were entitled to assume that those incharge of  their  duties\nwould faithfully and effectively discharge the same  in  a  prudent  manner.\nThe employers of such employees could not be held vicariously  liable  under\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_138\">IPC</a> for the failure of the latter to do what was enjoined upon  them  in\nterms of  the  duties  attached  to  their  employment.   Support  for  that\nproposition was drawn  by  Mr.  Jethmalani  from  the  English  decision  in\nHazeldine v. C.A. Daw and Son Ltd. and Ors. (1941) 2 KB 343. The third  limb\nof the argument of  the  learned  counsel  was  that  having  convicted  and\nsentenced the gatekeeper for the offence  punishable  under  Section  304-A,\nthe High Court could not hold the Ansals guilty or punish them for the  same\noffence since there is no vicarious liability in criminal law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_220\">151.  In Gee v. The Metropolitan Railway Company (supra), a train  passenger\nleant on the door of a railway carriage believing it to have  been  properly\nfastened, when in fact it was not. This resulted in  the  door  flying  open\nand the passenger getting thrown out of  the  carriage.   The  question  was\nwhether there was any contributory negligence  on  the  part  of  the  train\npassenger.  The Court held that the passenger was entitled  to  assume  that\nthe door had been properly fastened and that the accident  had  been  caused\nby the defendants’ negligence.  The Court observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_229\">           “Because I am  of  opinion  that  any  passenger  in  a  railway\n           carriage, who rises for the purpose either of looking out of the\n           window, or dealing with, and touching, and bringing his body  in\n           contact with the door for any lawful purpose whatsoever,  has  a\n           right to assume, and is justified in assuming, that the door  is\n           properly fastened; and if by reason of its  not  being  properly\n           fastened his lawful  act  causes  the  door  to  fly  open,  the\n           accident is caused by the defendants&#x27; negligence.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_221\">152.  The above decision was affirmed by the House of Lords in Grant v.  Sun\nShipping Co. Ltd.  and  Anr.  (supra)  where  an  injury  was  caused  to  a\nstevedore on a  ship  when  he  wrongly  assumed  that  no  hatch  was  left\nuncovered and unlit and therefore fell into the hatch.   The Court  in  that\ncase also was concerned with the question of  contributory  negligence.   It\nis noteworthy that the Court qualified the principle stated in  Gee  v.  The\nMetropolitan Railway Company’s case (supra) by holding that  a  prudent  man\nwould guard against the possible negligence of others when experience  shows\nsuch negligence to be common.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_222\">153.  In Green v. Fibreglass Ltd. (supra), a cleaning lady was  injured  due\nto faulty wiring on the premises where she was  invited  to  work.   It  was\nheld that the occupiers of the premises should be taken to  have  discharged\ntheir duty to the plaintiff as inviters by  employing  competent  electrical\ncontractors and by taking the precaution of  rewiring  the  premises  before\nthey began to occupy the same.  If  some  act  was  to  be  performed  which\ncalled for special knowledge and experience which the inviter could  not  be\nexpected to possess, he fulfilled his duty of care by employing a  qualified\nand reputable expert to do the work.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_223\">154.  It appears from a reading of the above cases that the  principle  that\nan occupier is entitled to assume  that  others  have  done  their  duty  is\napplicable, provided that experience  has  not  revealed  to  him  that  the\nnegligence of others is common, nor did  he  at  any  time  have  reason  to\nbelieve that his premises was unsafe. It is difficult for the  occupiers  in\nthe present case to argue that they did not have reason to believe that  the\npremises was unsafe, given the occurrence of a  similar  fire  in  1989,  as\nwell as the number of occasions on which defects in their premises had  been\npointed out to them.  Moreover, although <a href=\"/doc/1769491/\" id=\"a_139\">Section  12</a>  of  the  Cinematograph\nAct did require the licensing authority to take in  to  account  substantial\ncompliance  with  the  rules,  as  well  as  existence  of  adequate  safety\nprecautions in the premises, Rule 10(1) of DCR, 1953 unambiguously cast  the\nresponsibility  for  maintaining  such  compliance  and  safety   upon   the\noccupier. <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_140\">The Act</a> and Rules are silent  regarding  the  consequences  to  be\nfaced by a licensing authority who  does  not  fulfill  his  duty,  however,\n<a href=\"/doc/1107870/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 14</a> of the Cinematograph Act imposes a penalty on the occupier  of  a\nlicensed premises who violates the conditions of  the  cinema  license.  One\nsuch condition in the present case was compliance with  the  First  Schedule\nof the DCR, 1953. Therefore, this is not a situation where  the  law  treats\nthe occupier as an ignorant  person  who  requires  experts  to  verify  the\nsafety of his premises. Rather, the Act  places  an  independent  obligation\nupon him  to  maintain  compliance  with  the  rules,  irrespective  of  the\nassessment of the public authorities.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_224\">155.  It is, therefore, difficult to accept the argument that the  occupiers\nin the present case blindly accepted the assessment of  the  inspecting  and\nlicensing authorities. If that were to be  true,  they  ought  not  to  have\nresisted the removal of 43 extra seats in the  balcony  as  ordered  by  the\nlicensing authority pursuant to the withdrawal  of  the  1976  notification,\nand they ought not to have failed to cure  the  defects  in  their  premises\npointed out by the MCD after the inspection in 1983.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_225\">156.  Reliance by Mr. Jethmalani  upon  the  decision  in  Hazeldine’s  case\n(supra) to support the second limb of his argument is  also,  in  our  view,\nmisplaced.  That was a case, where the  landlord  had  employed  a  firm  of\nengineers to adjust, clean and lubricate the  machinery  of  the  lift  once\nevery month, to repack the glands when needed and to report to  him  if  any\nrepairs were needed.  An employee of the engineers engaged for  the  purpose\nrepacked one of the  glands  but  failed  to  replace  it  properly  thereby\ncausing the gland to fracture when the lift was worked and  an  accident  in\nwhich the plaintiff was injured.  The  Court  held  that  the  landlord  had\ndischarged his obligation to keep the lift reasonably safe  by  employing  a\ncompetent firm of engineers. The owner of the lift  was  not,  observed  the\nCourt, aware of any defect or danger in operating the lift.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_226\">157.  The fact situation in the case at hand is  entirely  different.   Here\nthe duty to care for the safety of the invitees lies upon the occupiers  not\nonly under the common law but even  under  the  statutory  enactment.   More\nimportantly, the occupiers have, as  seen  in  the  earlier  parts  of  this\njudgment, been aware at all material times, of  the  statutory  requirements\nand  deviations  which  were  repeatedly  pointed  out  by  the  authorities\nconcerned as a safety hazard for the patrons of  the  cinema  theatre.   The\nstaff employed by the occupiers had no role to play in these  deviations  or\ntheir removal.  There is nothing on record to  suggest  that  the  occupiers\nhad issued instructions to the staff to have  the  deviations  and  breaches\nremoved and/or corrected, or that those instructions were not complied  with\nby the latter resulting in the  fire  incident  that  claimed  human  lives.\nUnlike in Hazeldine’s case (supra), the occupiers  had  not  done  all  that\ncould and ought  to  have  been  done  by  them  to  avert  any  tragedy  in\nconnection with the use of an unsafe premises frequented by the  public  for\nentertainment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_227\">158.  Equally untenable is the argument that since  the  gatekeeper  of  the\nbalcony has been found guilty and sentenced to imprisonment,  the  occupiers\nmust be held to be innocent.  The argument is an  attempt  to  over-simplify\nthe legal position ignoring the factual matrix in which the prosecution  was\nlaunched and the appellants found guilty.  If  the  appellants  have  indeed\ncommitted gross negligence resulting in the  death  of  a  large  number  of\ninnocents, they cannot argue that just because one  of  those  found  to  be\nequally rash or negligent had been convicted for the very same offence  they\nmust be held to be not at fault.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_228\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1347962\" id=\"span_29\">159.  Mr. Jethmalani  next  argued  that  the  charges  framed  against  the\naccused-appellants, Sushil and Gopal Ansal were defective  inasmuch  as  the\nsame did not specify the days or period when  the  offence  took  place  nor\neven indicate the statutory  provisions,  rules  and  regulations  allegedly\nviolated by the appellants or accuse  the  appellants  of  gross  negligence\nwhich alone could constitute  an  offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_142\">Section  304A</a>  IPC.  These\ndefects,  contended  the  learned  counsel,  had  caused  prejudice  to  the\nappellants in their defence and ought to vitiate the  trial  and  result  in\ntheir acquittal.  A  similar  contention,  it  appears,  was  urged  by  the\nappellants even before the High  Court  who  has  referred  to  the  charges\nframed against the appellants at some length and discussed the  law  on  the\npoint by reference to Sections 211, 215 and <a href=\"/doc/936345/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 464</a> of  the  Cr.P.C.  to\nhold that the charges were reasonably clear and that  no  prejudice  in  any\ncase had been caused to the appellants  to  warrant  interference  with  the\ntrial or the conviction of the  appellants  on  that  ground.   Reliance  in\nsupport was placed by the High Court upon the  decision  of  this  Court  in\n<a href=\"/doc/1347962/\" id=\"a_144\">Willie (William) Slaney v. State of Madhya Pradesh</a> (AIR  1956  SC  116)  and\nseveral later decisions that have  reiterated  the  legal  position  on  the\nsubject.  There is in our opinion no error in the view  taken  by  the  High\nCourt in this regard.  <a href=\"/doc/936345/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 464</a> of the  Cr.P.C.  completely  answers  the\ncontention urged on behalf of the appellants.   It  in  no  uncertain  terms\nprovides that an error, omission or irregularity  in  the  charge  including\nany misjoinder of charges shall not invalidate any sentence or order  passed\nby a Court of competent jurisdiction unless in the opinion  of  a  Court  of\nappeal, confirmation or revision a failure  of  justice  has  in  fact  been\noccasioned thereby.  The language employed in Section 464 is so  plain  that\nthe same does not require any elaboration as to the approach to  be  adopted\nby the Court. Even so the pronouncements of this Court not only in  Slaney’s\ncase (supra) but in a long line of subsequent  decisions  place  the  matter\nbeyond the pale of any  further  deliberation  on  the  subject.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1769219\" id=\"span_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1566447\" id=\"span_31\">See  <a href=\"/doc/1566447/\" id=\"a_146\">K.C.\nMathew v.

Is  the  charge  to  be\n           regarded as a ritualistic formula so sacred and fundamental that\n           a total absence of one, or any departure in it from  the  strict\n           and technical requirements of the Code, is so vital as to cut at\n           the root of the trial and vitiate it from the start,  or  is  it\n           one of many regulations designed to ensure  a  fair  and  proper\n           trial so that  substantial,  as  opposed  to  purely  technical,\n           compliance with the spirit and requirements of the Code in  this\n           behalf is enough to cure departures from the  strict  letter  of\n           the law ?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_231\">           6. Before we proceed to set  out  our  answer  and  examine  the\n           provisions of the Code, we will pause to observe that  the  Code\n           is a code  of  procedure  and,  like  all  procedural  laws,  is\n           designed to further the ends of justice  and  not  to  frustrate\n           them by the introduction of endless technicalities.  The  object\n           of the Code is to ensure that an accused person gets a full  and\n           fair trial along certain  well-established  and  well-understood\n           lines that accord with our notions of  natural  justice.  If  he\n           does, if he is tried by a competent court, if  he  is  told  and\n           clearly understands the nature of the offence for  which  he  is\n           being tried, if  the  case  against  him  is  fully  and  fairly\n           explained to him and he is afforded a full and fair  opportunity\n           of  defending  himself,  then,  provided  there  is  substantial\n           compliance with the outward forms of the law, mere  mistakes  in\n           procedure, mere inconsequential  errors  and  omissions  in  the\n           trial are regarded as venal by the Code and  the  trial  is  not\n           vitiated unless the  accused  can  show  substantial  prejudice.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_230\">           That, broadly speaking, is the basic principle on which the Code\n           is based...”\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_231\">161.  To the same effect are the  subsequent  decisions  of  this  Court  to\nwhich we have <a href=\"/doc/1769219/\" id=\"a_148\">referred to above</a>.  Applying the test <a href=\"/doc/1769219/\" id=\"a_149\">laid down  in</a>  the  said\ncases we have no hesitation in holding that there was nothing  fundamentally\nwrong  with  the  charges  framed  against  the  appellants  nor  have   the\nappellants been able to demonstrate that  they  suffered  any  prejudice  on\naccount of the alleged defects.  The High Court has in our opinion  taken  a\ncorrect view on the question urged  before  which  does  not  call  for  any\ninterference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_232\">162.  It was also contended by Mr. Jethmalani that  all  such  incriminating\ncircumstances as have been used against the appellants were not put  to  the\naccused. The High Court has while dealing with a  similar  contention  urged\nbefore it carefully examined the case of each appellant and found  no  merit\nin them.  That apart we have been taken through the statements made  by  the\naccused  under  <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_150\">Section  313</a>  Cr.P.C.  and   find   that   the   same   have\ncomprehensively put the circumstances appearing against  the  appellants  to\nthem and thereby given them an opportunity to explain  the  same.   Besides,\nso long as there is no prejudice demonstrated by the appellants  on  account\nof any deficiency in the statements, there is  no  question  of  this  Court\ninterfering with the concurrent judgments and orders of the Courts below.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_233\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1046645\" id=\"span_32\">163.  We may at this stage simply refer to the decision  of  this  Court  in\n<a href=\"/doc/1046645/\" id=\"a_151\">Jai Dev v. State of Punjab</a> AIR 1963 SC 612, where  P.B.  Gajendragadkar,  J.\n(as His Lordship then was) speaking for a three-Judge  Bench  explained  the\npurpose  underlying  the  statement  under  Section  342  (now  <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_152\">Section  313</a>\nCr.P.C.) in the following words:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_232\">           “The ultimate test in determining whether or not the accused has\n           been fairly examined under  Section  342  would  be  to  enquire\n           whether, having regard to all the questions put to him,  he  did\n           get an opportunity to say what he wanted to say  in  respect  of\n           prosecution  case  against  him.   If  it   appears   that   the\n           examination of the accused person was defective  and  thereby  a\n           prejudice has been caused to him,  that  would  no  doubt  be  a\n           serious infirmity.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_234\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1035123\" id=\"span_33\">164. We may also refer to the decision of this Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/1035123/\" id=\"a_153\">Shivaji  Sahabrao\n Bobade v. State of Maharashtra</a> (1973) 2 SCC 793, where this Court  declared\n that an omission in the statement under Section 313  does  not  ipso  facto\n vitiate the proceedings and that prejudice occasioned by such  defect  must\n be established by the accused. The following  passage  is  in  this  regard\n apposite:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_233\">           “It is trite law, nevertheless fundamental, that the  prisoner’s\n           attention should be drawn to every inculpatory material so as to\n           enable him to explain it.  This  is  the  basic  fairness  of  a\n           criminal trial and failures in this area may gravely imperil the\n           validity of the trial itself, if  consequential  miscarriage  of\n           justice  has  flowed.   However,  where  such  an  omission  has\n           occurred it does not ipso  facto  vitiate  the  proceedings  and\n           prejudice occasioned by such defect must be established  by  the\n           accused.  In the event of evidentiary material not being put  to\n           the accused, the court must ordinarily eschew such material from\n           consideration. It is also open to the appellate  court  to  call\n           upon the counsel for the accused to show  what  explanation  the\n           accused has as regards the circumstances established against him\n           but not put to him and if the accused is  unable  to  offer  the\n           appellate court any plausible or reasonable explanation of  such\n           circumstances, the Court may assume that  no  acceptable  answer\n           exists and that even if the accused had been questioned  at  the\n           proper time in the trial court he would not have  been  able  to\n           furnish any good ground to get out of the circumstances on which\n           the trial court had relied for its conviction. In such  a  case,\n           the  Court  proceeds  on  the  footing  that  though   a   grave\n           irregularity has occurred as regards compliance with <a href=\"/doc/697591/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 342</a>\n           Cr.P.C. the omission has not been  shown  to  have  been  caused\n           prejudice to the accused.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_235\">165.  To the same effect is the decision  of  this  Court  in  State  (Delhi\nAdmn.) v. Dharampal (2001) 10 SCC  372  and  Bakhshish  Singh  v.  State  of\nPunjab AIR 1967 SC 752.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_236\">166. Suffice it to say that the circumstances appearing against the  accused\npersons have been elaborately put to them  under  <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_155\">Section  313</a>  Cr.P.C.  The\ncontention that the appellants suffered any prejudice on account of a  given\ncircumstance not having put to them has, in our opinion,  no  merit  and  is\naccordingly rejected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_237\">166.  In the light of the above discussion, we see no  reason  to  interfere\nwith the judgments and orders of the Courts below in  so  far  as  the  same\nhave convicted appellant-Ansal brothers for offences  under  Sections  304A,\n337, 338 read with <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 36</a> IPC and <a href=\"/doc/1107870/\" id=\"a_157\">Section 14</a> of the  Cinematograph  Act,\n1952.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_238\">167.  As regards the conviction of Divisional Fire  Officer,  H.  S.  Panwar\n(A15) assailed in Criminal Appeal No.599/2010, the  trial  Court  has  on  a\nreappraisal of the evidence  adduced  at  the  trial  found  that  the  said\naccused had acted in a grossly rash  and  negligent  manner  in  issuing  No\nObjection Certificates without carrying  out  a  proper  inspection  of  the\ncinema hall from the fire safety angle,  resulting  in  issue  of  temporary\npermits in favour of the theatre which directly resulted in the death of  59\npersons in the incident in question.  The trial Court observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_234\">           “Accused H.S. Panwar acted with gross negligence by recommending\n           ‘No Objection certificate’ without  fulfilling  requirements  of\n           law and without carrying  out  inspection  of  the  cinema  hall\n           building from fire  safety  point  of  view,  resulting  in  the\n           issuance of temporary permits and  on  the  basis  of  the  same\n           exhibition of films, which action resulted into the death of the\n           patrons inside the cinema hall on the day of the incident.   The\n           accused committed breach of duty by omitting to  point  out  the\n           fire hazards and deficiencies in fire fighting measures  in  the\n           cinema building, which act amounts to culpable negligence on his\n           part.  The act of accused can also  be  described  as  ‘culpable\n           rashness’ since being an officer from the office of  Chief  Fire\n           Officer, he was conscious that the intended  consequences  would\n           surely ensure.  The accused by, omitting to do his lawful duties\n           committed gross negligence and rashness which was the direct and\n           proximate cause of the death of 59  persons.   Accordingly,  the\n           accused H.S. Panwar is held guilty for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_158\">Section\n           304A</a> IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_159\">section 36</a> IPC.  The  accused  is  also  held\n           guilty for the injury to the patrons in the cinema hall for  the\n           offence under <a href=\"/doc/1402213/\" id=\"a_160\">section 337</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1721129/\" id=\"a_161\">338</a> IPC.”\n\n                                                        (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_239\">168.  The above finding was affirmed by the  High  Court  in  the  following\nwords with a reduction in his sentence:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_235\">           “… Concerning accused H.S. Panwar, the  negligent  and  careless\n           inspection carried out by him has been  held to be a significant\n           and direct cause of the  accident,  which  took  away  lives  of\n           innocent people, and grievously  injured  several  others.   His\n           vigil could have prevented the fire clearance  certificate.   If\n           he had displayed the same zeal that he did  in  November,  1996,\n           when the inspection report did not yield a no objection?   (sic)\n           There would have been a greater  scrutiny  of  the  fire  safety\n           norms.  Instead, he certified that fire safety  norms  had  been\n           complied with, whereas in actuality they were not.  No doubt, he\n           has served the Delhi Fire Service for a long time; according  to\n           the trial court judgment, he was  68  years  when  the  impugned\n           judgment  was  pronounced.   He   is   also   a   recipient   of\n           commendations.  On a conspectus of all these circumstances,  the\n           court is of the opinion that ends of justice would be served  if\n           the sentence is reduced to rigorous imprisonment  for  one  year\n           and Rs.5000/- under section 304-A.  The default sentence in  his\n           case is also modified to simple  imprisonment  for  two  months.\n           The conviction by the trial court is therefore maintained and to\n           the above extent….”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_240\">169.  Mr. Mehrotra, learned counsel for the appellant  H.S.  Panwar  made  a\ntwo-fold submission in support  of  his  appeal.   Firstly  he  argued  that\naccording to the standard practice prevalent  in  the  Fire  Department  the\nappellant H.S. Panwar then Divisional Fire Officer was required  to  give  a\nreport in terms of the  proforma  prescribed  for  the  purpose.   This  was\naccording to the learned counsel evident from the deposition  of  Shri  G.D.\nVerma (PW 37) the then Chief Fire  Officer.   He  urged  that  even  earlier\ninspections had been made on the basis of the very same proforma, which  was\ncorrectly filled up by the appellant furnishing  the  requisite  information\ndemanded in the proforma.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_241\">170.   Secondly  it  was  contended  by  Mr.  Mehrotra  that  the   Victims’\nAssociation had claimed compensation from the management of the  theatre  as\nwell as MCD Delhi Fire Service, in which case the High Court had  exonerated\nDelhi Fire Service.  That finding had attained finality as the same was  not\nchallenged by the Association. This, argued  the  learned  counsel,  implied\nthat the Fire Service or its officers were not at fault for  the  occurrence\nin question, a circumstance which could and ought to be kept in view.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_242\">171.  There is, in our opinion, no merit in either one  of  the  submissions\nmade by Mr. Mehrotra. Clearance by the Fire Department  was,  it  is  common\nground, an essential pre-requisite for the grant of a license,  its  renewal\nor the issue of a temporary permit  for  exhibition  of  the  films  in  any\ncinema hall. This clearance could be granted only if the officers  concerned\nwere fully satisfied after an inspection of the  cinema  premises  that  the\nsame was indeed safe for use  as a place for exhibition  of  cinematographs.\nAnyone discharging that important function had to be extremely vigilant  as,\nany neglect on his part could allow an unsafe premises being used  resulting\nin serious consequences as in the present case.   Far  from  being  vigilant\nand careful about the inspection, H.S. Panwar  grossly  neglected  the  duty\ncast  upon  him,  resulting  in  the  issue  of  temporary  permits,   which\ncontributed  to  the  causa  causans  of  the  incident.  It   is   in   the\ncircumstances no defence for the appellant-H.S. Panwar to plead that he  was\nasked to report only according to  the  proforma  furnished  to  him.  As  a\nsenior and experienced officer in the Fire Service Department, he  ought  to\nhave known the purpose of his inspection and the care  he  was  required  to\ntake in the interest of the safety of hundreds, if not  thousands  of  cine-\ngoers who throng to such public places for entertainment. In as much  as  he\nfailed to do so, and issued  a  certificate  which  compromised  the  safety\nrequirements and endangered human lives resulting directly in the loss of  a\nlarge number of them, he has been rightly found guilty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_243\">172.  So also the second  limb  of  Mr.  Mehrotra’s  submission  is  in  our\nopinion without any substance.  The  question  whether  the  appellant  H.S.\nPanwar was grossly negligent resulting in the loss of valuable  human  lives\nhas to be determined on the basis of the evidence on record in  the  present\ncase and not on the basis of findings which the High Court may have held  in\na summary proceedings for payment of compensation to the victims  and  their\nfamilies recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_162\">Article 226</a> of the constitution.   The  evidence  in\nthe case at hand has been appraised by the two Courts  below  and  found  to\nestablish the charge of negligence against the appellant.  There is, in  our\nopinion, no compelling reason for us to take a different view in the  matter\nespecially when we do not see any miscarriage of justice  or  perversity  in\nthe reasoning adopted by the trial Court and the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_244\">173.  It brings us to Criminal Appeals No.617-627 of 2010 and  604  of  2010\nfiled by B.M. Satija (A-9) and Bir  Singh  (A-11)  respectively.  They  were\ntogether  with  A.K.  Gera  (A-10)  charged  with  commission  of   offences\npunishable under Sections 304 read with <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_163\">Section 36</a> of the  IPC.   The  trial\nCourt, as already noticed in the earlier part of  this  judgment,  held  all\nthe three accused persons mentioned above guilty of the offence  with  which\nthey were charged and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for  a\nperiod  of  seven  years  besides  a  fine  of  Rs.5000/-  and  six   months\nimprisonment in default. In criminal appeals  filed  by  the  three  accused\npersons, the High Court has converted the conviction from Section  304  Part\nII to Sections 304A, 337 and 338 read with <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_164\">Section 36</a> of the IPC in  so  far\nas B.M. Satija (A-9) and Bir Singh (A-11) are  concerned,  while  acquitting\nA.K. Gera (A-10) of the charge. The  High  Court  has  further  reduced  the\nsentence awarded to the appellants B.M. Satija (A-9) and  Bir  Singh  (A-11)\nfrom seven years rigorous imprisonment to two years and a fine of  Rs.2000/-\neach for the offence under Section  304-A,  rigorous  imprisonment  for  six\nmonths with fine of Rs.500/- for the offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1402213/\" id=\"a_165\">Section  337</a>,  IPC  and\nrigorous imprisonment for one year, with fine of Rs.1000/- for  the  offence\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1721129/\" id=\"a_166\">Section 338</a>, IPC.  While appellants B.M. Satija (A-9)  and  Bir  Singh\n(A-11) have assailed their conviction and sentence before us,  the  CBI  has\nchallenged the acquittal of A.K. Gera (A-10) in Criminal Appeals  No.605-616\nof 2010.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_245\">174.  Appearing for appellant-B.M. Satija, Mr.  V.V.  Giri,  learned  senior\ncounsel argued that the appellant was not one of those deputed to attend  to\nthe complaint about  the  malfunctioning  of  the  DVB  transformer  on  the\nmorning of 13th June, 1997.  He  submitted  that  evidence  adduced  by  the\nprosecution regarding his presence  and  association  with  the  process  of\nrectification was sketchy and did not prove beyond a  reasonable  doubt  his\npresence on the spot.  He made an attempt to  persuade  us  to  reverse  the\nconcurrent findings of fact recorded by two Courts below in this regard  and\ndrew our attention to the depositions of P.C. Bhardwaj  (PW-40),  V.K  Gupta\n(PW-43) and Bhagwandeen (PW-44) as also the documents  marked  Ex.  PW-40/C,\n40/A and 40/P.  He urged that the CFSL report recording the signatures  sent\nfor examination did not lend any support to the prosecution case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_246\">175.  Mr.  Gopal  Singh,  Senior  Counsel  appearing  for  A.K.  Gera  (A-9)\nrespondent in CBI’s Criminal Appeal No.605-616 of 2010  contended  that  the\norder passed by the High Court was based on  appreciation  of  the  evidence\nadduced by the trial Court and that interference  with  any  such  order  of\nacquittal is rare unless it is found to  be  patently  perverse.   He  urged\nthat his client A.K. Gera (A-9) was not posted  in  the  concerned  zone  in\nwhich the DVB transformer was installed.  He had nothing  to  do  with  this\nact.  The trial Court and the High Court have both  concurrently  held  that\nthe repairs of the DVB transformer were carried out by Bir Singh (A-11)  and\nB.M. Satija A(-9).  That finding is without any perversity.  The High  Court\nhas relying upon the depositions of P.C. Bhardwaj  (PW-40)  and  Bhagwandeen\n(PW-44) observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_236\">           “14.12      So far as role of the accused B.M.  Satija  and  Bir\n           Singh are concerned, PW-40 P.C. Bhardwaj deposed having informed\n           B.M. Satija about the morning complaint.  PW-44 deposed that all\n           3, i.e.,  Gera,  Satija  and  Bir  Singh  were  instrumental  in\n           repairing of the DVB transformer at Uphaar  in  the  morning  of\n           13.6.1997.  Expert evidence in the form  of  PW-35/A;  Ex.PW36/A\n           all established that the cause of fire was improper crimping  of\n           the cable end with the socket which ultimately detached  at  the\n           crucial time, resulted in intense sparking, settling down of the\n           cable on the transformer which resulted in a  slit;  transformer\n           oil gushed out, caught fire  and  spread  to  the  parking  area\n           resulting in the improperly parked vehicles catching fire.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_237\">           14.13       xxxxx\n\n           14.14 The depositions of other witnesses assume importance.  PW-\n           40 clearly mentioned that he had discussed  the  complaint  with\n           Satija and chalked out the  programme.   PW/44  clearly  deposed\n           having accompanied Satija, Bir Singh and Gera  to  the  relevant\n           site at Uphar and witnessing the repairs with the aid of dye and\n           hammer.  At one place, he mentioned that Bir Singh  carried  out\n           the repair under  the  supervision  of  both  the  officers,  in\n           another place of his deposition, he mentioned that  Bir  Singh’s\n           work was supervised by Satija.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_247\">176.  The above findings do not in our view suffer from  any  perversity  or\nany miscarriage of justice or call for interference  under  appeal  in  this\nconnection under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_167\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution of India.

Gera (A-9), the High Court has held that he was present on the  spot\nbut in the absence of any further evidence to prove the role played by  him,\nthe High Court considered it unsafe to convict him for imprisonment:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_238\">           “On an overall conspectus of the above facts, this Court  is  of\n           opinion that though Gera’s presence at site stands  established,\n           in the absence of fuller evidence about the role played by  him,\n           there can be no presumption that  he  played  any  part  in  the\n           defective repairs, carried out without the aid of  the  crimping\n           machine on the Uphaar DVB transformer.  Mere presence when  that\n           cannot lead to presumption of involvement of an actor who is not\n           expected to play any role and is insufficient, in the opinion of\n           the Court, to saddle criminal liability of the  kind  envisioned\n           under  Section 304-A.  To establish that Gera had a duty to care\n           to ensure that notwithstanding the  defective  crimping  carried\n           out by the employees competent to do  so  and  that  he  had  an\n           overriding responsibility of objecting to the work done by them,\n           without proving whether he was there during the entire operation\n           and if so how the extent of his involvement, the conviction  for\n           causing death due to criminal negligence cannot be  arrived  at.\n           Although,  there  are  circumstances  which  point   to   Gera’s\n           presence, they may even amount to suspicion of the  role  played\n           by him, yet such evidence proved are insufficient to  prove  the\n           case against him beyond reasonable doubt.  In the circumstances,\n           neither can be he convicted under Section 304 Part-II, nor under\n           Section 304-A read with 337/338 and 36 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_168\">IPC</a>.”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_248\">177.  In fairness to Mr. Salve, learned counsel appearing for  the  CBI,  we\nmust mention that he did not seriously assail the above reasoning  given  by\nthe High Court.  At any rate,  the  view  taken  by  the  High  Court  is  a\npossible view. We see no compelling reason to interfere with  that  view  in\nthe facts and circumstances of the case.  Having  said  that,  the  question\nremains whether the High Court was justified in  convicting  appellants  Bir\nSingh (A-11) and B.M. Satija (A-9) for  the  offence  of  causing  death  by\nrashness and gross negligence, punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_169\">sections 304A</a> of the IPC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_249\">178.  In our view, the causa causans for the death of 59 persons  was  their\ninability to quickly exit from the balcony area for reasons we have  already\nindicated. That being so, even when the repairs carried out by Bir Singh (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_250\">11) and B.M. Satija (A-9) may have been found to be unsatisfactory  for  the\nreasons given by  the  trial  Court  and  the  High  Court,  which  we  have\naffirmed, the fire resulting from such poor repair was no  more  than  causa\nsine qua non for the deaths and, therefore, did not  constitute  an  offence\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 304A</a> of the IPC. Besides,  the  negligence  of  the\noccupiers of the cinema having intervened between the  negligence  of  these\ntwo officials of the DVB and the deaths that occurred in the  incident,  the\ncausal connection between the  deaths  and  act  of  shabby  repair  of  the\ninstallation of the DVB transformer is not established directly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_251\">179.  The conviction of these two  appellants  under  Section  304A  cannot,\ntherefore, be sustained.  That would, however, not affect  their  conviction\nunder Sections 337 and 338 read with <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_171\">Section  36</a>  of  the  IPC  which  would\nremain unaffected and is hereby affirmed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_252\">180.  Question No.1 is accordingly answered on the above lines.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_253\">Re: Question No.II:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_254\">181.  The charge framed against N.S. Chopra  (A-6)  and  other  Managers  of\nUphaar Cinema was  one  for  commission  of  the  offence  punishable  under\nSection 304 Part II read with <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_172\">Section 36</a> of the  IPC.  The  allegation  made\nagainst the Managers was that even when they were present  on  the  premises\nat the time of the incident, they had failed to either warn the  patrons  or\nfacilitate their escape. They instead fled the scene despite  the  knowledge\nthat  death  was  likely  to  be  caused  by  their  acts  of  omission  and\ncommission.  The Trial Court had found the charge proved and  convicted  and\nsentenced N.S. Chopra to undergo imprisonment for a period  of  seven  years\nbesides a fine of Rs.5,000/- and imprisonment for six months in  default  of\npayment. The High Court reversed that view qua N.S.  Chopra  and  also  R.K.\nSharma (A-5) (since deceased). The High Court acquitted them of the  charges\nfor reasons which it summed up in the following words:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_239\">           “10.11 Section 304, first part requires proof  of  intention  to\n           cause death or such bodily harm as would cause death; the second\n           part requires proof that  knowledge  existed  that  such  injury\n           would result in death, or grievous injury likely  to  result  in\n           death. The crucial aspect in both cases, is the state  of  mind,\n           i.e “intention” or “knowledge” of the consequence. Proof of such\n           intention or knowledge has to be necessarily, of a  high  order;\n           all other hypotheses of innocence of the  accused,  have  to  be\n           ruled out. The prosecution here, glaringly has not  proved  when\n           these two accused fled the cinema hall; there is  no  eyewitness\n           testifying to their having been in the balcony  when  the  smoke\n           entered the hall, and having left it, which could   have  proved\n           knowledge of the likely deaths  and  grievous  bodily  injuries.\n           Thus,  this  court  is  of  the  opinion  that  proof  of  these\n           appellants, i.e N.S. Chopra and R.K.  Sharma,  having  committed\n           the  offence  under  Section  304,  is  not  forthcoming.  Their\n           conviction  under   that   provision   cannot,   therefore,   be\n           sustained.”\n\n                                                         (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_255\">182.  The High Court also examined  whether  N.S.  Chopra  and  R.K.  Sharma\ncould be convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_173\">Section 304A</a> IPC, and  answered  that  question  in\nthe negative.  The High Court was of  the  view  that  the  prosecution  had\nfailed to establish that N.S. Chopra was present on the scene and also  that\nthe documentary evidence adduced  at  the  trial  proved  that  he  had  not\nreported for duty on the fateful day.  The High Court observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_240\">           “10.13 As far  as  R.  K.  Sharma  is  concerned,  the  evidence\n           establishes that he had reported for duty… N.S. Chopra,  on  the\n           other hand, according to the documentary evidence (Ex. PW-108/DB-\n           1, found in  Ex.PW97/C)  had  not  reported  for  duty.  In  his\n           statement under Section 313, he  mentioned  having  reached  the\n           cinema hall at 5-30 PM, and not being allowed inside, since  the\n           fire was raging in the building.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_241\">           xx xx xx\n\n           10.17 The totality of the above circumstances no doubt points to\n           complete managerial and supervisory failure in the cinema.  Such\n           inaction is certainly culpable, and points to grave lapses. This\n           undoubtedly  was  an  important  and  significant  part  of  the\n           causation chain. Yet, to convict the  accused  R.K.  Sharma  and\n           N.C.  Chopra,  there  should  be  more   convincing   proof   of\n           involvement. At best, there is evidence of  suspicion  of  their\n           involvement. Yet, no attempt to prove that  they  were  present,\n           and did not take any effective measures to evacuate the patrons,\n           which they were bound to do, in the normal course of their duty,\n           has been made. Mere proof  that  these  accused  were  Assistant\n           Manager, and Manager, as on the date of the accident,  and  that\n           one of them  had  reported  earlier,  during  the  day,  is  not\n           adequate  to  prove  that  they  caused  death   by   criminally\n           negligent, or rash act. There was failure on  the  part  of  the\n           trial court to notice that the two vital aspects, i.e  duty  and\n           breach of that duty of such scale, as to amount to  an  offence.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_256\">           Their appeals are entitled to succeed. These appellants have to,\n           therefore, be acquitted of  the  charges.

In fairness to Mr. Salve and Mr. Tulsi, we must say  that  no  serious\nattempt was made by them to demolish  the  reasoning  adopted  by  the  High\nCourt in coming to its conclusion.  That apart, the view taken by  the  High\nCourt on a fair appreciation of the evidence,  both  oral  and  documentary,\ndoes not even otherwise call for any interference by us as  the  same  is  a\nreasonably possible view.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_258\">184.  Coming then to the acquittal of S.S. Sharma (A-13) and N.D. Tiwari (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_259\">14), Administrative Officers, MCD, the charges framed against the  said  two\naccused persons were for offences punishable under  Section  304A,  337  and\n338 read with <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_174\">Section 36</a> IPC. The allegation levelled against them was  that\nthey negligently issued No Objection certificates to Uphaar  Cinema  in  the\nyears 1995-96 and 1996-97 without so much as conducting inspections  of  the\npremises, and thereby committed a breach of the <a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_175\">Cinematograph  Act</a>  and  the\nRules made thereunder.  The Trial Court found that  charge  established  and\naccordingly convicted and sentenced both  the  accused  persons  to  undergo\nimprisonment for a period of two years and a  fine  of  Rs.5,000/-  for  the\noffence  punishable  under  Section  304A,  six  months  for   the   offence\npunishable under Section 337 and two years under Section 338  of  the  Code.\nThe High Court has in appeal  reversed  the  conviction  and  the  sentences\nawarded to the accused persons on the reasoning that it  summed  up  in  the\nfollowing words:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_242\">           “13.6 The prosecution, in order to  succeed  in  its  charge  of\n           accused Mr. S.S. Sharma and Mr. N.D. Tiwari  having  acted  with\n           criminal negligence and caused death and serious injury,  should\n           have first established the duty  of  care  either  through  some\n           enacted law like DCR, 1953  or  DCR,  1981  or  a  general  duty\n           discernable in their normal course  of  official  functions.

Unlike in the case of the\n           Fire Department, the  Licensing  Department  or  the  Electrical\n           Inspectorate, all of whom are  named  authorities  empowered  to\n           inspect  the  premises,   there   is   no   role   assigned   to\n           Administrative Officers of the MCD. The rationale for  obtaining\n           &#x27;no objections&#x27; from these officers has been  left  unexplained.\n           The prosecution has failed to establish the necessity  for  such\n           No Objection Certificate and how without such document,  by  the\n           Administrative Officers of MCD,  the  licensing  authority,  DCP\n           (Licensing) would not have  issued  the  temporary  permit.

Tiwari  breached\n           their duties of care, the breach was of such magnitude as  would\n           have inevitably led to  death  or  grievous  injury  to  several\n           persons and that such consequence was reasonably foreseeable  by\n           them when they issued No Objection Certificates. No  doubt,  the\n           issuance of No Objection Certificates and handing them  over  to\n           the beneficiary directly was a careless, even  callous  act.  It\n           was also used to be placed on the record as  a  prelude  to  the\n           issuance  of  the  permits.  But  in  the  absence  of   clearly\n           discernable duty of care and the magnitude of foreseeable damage\n           by these accused, this Court cannot affirm the findings  of  the\n           Trial Court and their conviction.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_244\">           13.9 The appeals of Mr. S.S.

There was no serious argument advanced by either Mr. Salve,  appearing\nfor the CBI or Mr. Tulsi for assailing the correctness of the view taken  by\nthe High Court in appeal and rightly so because the High Court has,  in  our\nopinion, taken a fairly reasonable view which is in tune with  the  evidence\non record. There is, in our opinion, no room for our interference even  with\nthis part of the order passed by the High Court by which it  acquitted  S.S.\nSharma and N.D.

Our  answer  to\nQuestion No.II is in the affirmative.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_260\">Re: Question No.III:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_246\">186.  The Trial Court had framed charges against the accused persons  by  an\norder dated 9th April, 2001 by which Sushil and  Gopal  Ansal  were  charged\nwith commission of offence punishable under Section 304A, 337 and  338  read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 36</a> IPC.  Against that order framing charges the Association  of\nVictims of Uphaar Tragedy (AVUT) filed  Criminal  Revision  No.270  of  2001\nbefore the Delhi High Court to contend that a charge under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_177\">Section  304</a>  IPC\nalso ought to have been framed against the said  two  accused  persons.  The\ncase of the association was that there was overwhelming evidence  on  record\nto establish the charge.  That revision eventually failed and was  dismissed\nby the High Court by its order dated 11th September, 2001 (Sushil  Ansal  v.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_261\">State Through CBI etc. etc. 1995 (2002) DLT 623). Revision  petitions  filed\nby other accused persons against the order  of  framing  charges  were  also\ndismissed by the High Court by  the  very  same  order.   Dealing  with  the\ncontention urged on behalf of the AVUT the High Court observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_247\">           “34. The plea of Association of Victims  of  Uphaar  Tragedy  to\n           frame charges under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_178\">Section 304</a> IPC against accused  Sh.  Sushil\n           Ansal and Sh. Gopal Ansal, in addition to  the  charges  already\n           framed against them, cannot be sustained in  as  much  as  prima\n           facie a case of negligence only is made out  against  them.  The\n           allegations against them gross negligence,  wanton  carelessness\n           and  callous  indifference  in  regard  to   the   up-keep   and\n           maintenance of the cinema. Had rapid dispersal  facilities  been\n           available to the patrons in the  balcony,  no  death  or  injury\n           could have taken place  and  as  such,  this  Court  is  of  the\n           considered view that there are no good  and  sufficient  grounds\n           for slapping a charge under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_179\">Section 304</a> IPC  against  these  two\n           accused.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_248\">187.  What is significant is that AVUT did not bring up the matter  to  this\nCourt against the above order passed by the High  Court.  On  the  contrary,\nSushil Ansal appears to have filed a special leave petition  in  this  Court\nchallenging the dismissal of the revision petition by the High  Court  which\nwas subsequently dismissed as withdrawn by this Court by  order  dated  12th\nApril, 2002.  The result was that the  trial  commenced  against  the  Ansal\nbrothers on the basis of the charges framed by the Trial Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_249\">188.  The AVUT during the course of the trial made another attempt  to  have\nthe charge under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_180\">Section 304</a>  IPC  framed  against  the  Ansal  brothers  by\nmoving an application before the Trial  Court  to  that  effect.  The  Trial\nCourt, however, disposed of  that  application  stating  that  if  it  found\nsufficient evidence against the Ansal brothers  justifying  a  charge  under\n<a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_181\">Section 304</a> IPC or any other person for that matter, it  would  take  action\nsuo moto for framing such a charge. Final judgment of the  Trial  Court  was\ndelivered on 20th November, 2007 in which it  convicted  Ansal  brothers  of\nthe offence under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_182\">Section 304A</a> of the IPC,  which  clearly  meant  that  the\nTrial Court had not found any reason to frame any additional charge  against\nthem under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_183\">Section 304</a> IPC.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_250\">189.  Aggrieved by the omission of the Trial Court to frame a  charge  under\n<a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_184\">Section 304</a> IPC, AVUT filed a revision petition before the High Court  which\ntoo was dismissed by the High Court with the observation that their  earlier\nrevision petition framing charges under Sections 304, 337 and 338 read  with\nSection 36 having been dismissed by the  High  Court,  the  said  order  had\nbecome final, especially when the revisionist AVUT did not carry the  matter\nfurther to this Court. The High Court also held that the appeal against  the\nconviction of the Ansal brothers having  been  disposed  of,  there  was  no\nquestion of framing any charge for a graver offence in the  absence  of  any\nevidence unequivocally establishing that such a charge was made out and  yet\nhad not been framed.  The High Court held that procedure for  misjoinder  of\ncharges under Section 216 applied during the stage of  trial,  whereas  AVUT\nwas asking for a remand of the matter for a  retrial  on  the  fresh  charge\nunder Section 304 Part II, which was not permissible  under  the  scheme  of\nthe Code. The High Court also rejected the contention  that  Ansal  brothers\ncould be convicted for an offence graver than what they were charged with.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_251\">190.  In the appeal filed by AVUT against  the  order  passed  by  the  High\nCourt in the above revision petition,  they  have  agitated  the  very  same\nissue before us.  Appearing for the Victims Association,  Mr.  Tulsi  argued\nthat the acts of omission and commission of  Ansal  brothers  by  which  the\negress of the patrons was obstructed warranted a conviction not  merely  for\nthe offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_185\">Section 304A</a>  IPC  but  also  for  the  offence\npunishable under Section 304 Part II since according to the learned  counsel\nthe said acts were committed with the knowledge that  death  was  likely  to\nresult  thereby.   Mr.  Tulsi  in  particular  contended  that  the  act  of\ninstalling an eight-seater box that entirely blocked the right-side exit  in\nthe balcony was itself sufficient for the Court to order a  retrial  of  the\nAnsal brothers, since they knew by such an act they  were  likely  to  cause\ndeath of the patrons in the event of a fire incident. On  that  premise,  he\ncontended that the matter should be remanded back to  the  Trial  Court  for\nretrial for commission of the offence punishable under Section 304 Part  II.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_262\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"79026890\" id=\"span_34\">In support of the contention that the fact situation in  the  case  at  hand\nestablished a case under Section 304 Part II, Mr. Tulsi placed  reliance  on\nthe  decision  of  this  Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/79026890/\" id=\"a_186\">Alister  Anthony  Pereira  v.

The  fact  situation  in\nthe case at hand is not comparable to  a  case  of  drunken  driving  in  an\ninebriated state.

The trial  Court  <a href=\"/doc/79026890/\" id=\"a_213\">in\nthat case</a> had framed a charge against the  management  of  the  company  for\ncommission of an offence under Section 304 Part II, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_214\">IPC</a>,  which  was  upheld\nby the High Court in revision. This Court,  however,  set  aside  the  order\nframing the charge under Section 304 Part II and directed  that  charges  be\nframed under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 304A</a>, IPC instead. This Court observed:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_260\">           “20…The entire material which the prosecution relied upon before\n           the Trail Court for framing the charge and to which we have made\n           a detailed reference earlier, in our view, cannot support such a\n           charge unless it indicates prima  facie  that  on  that  fateful\n           night when the plant was  run  at  Bhopal  it  was  run  by  the\n           concerned accused with the knowledge that such  running  of  the\n           plant was likely to cause deaths of human beings.

Similarly  on   the\n           aforesaid material placed on record it could not be  even  prima\n           facie suggested by the prosecution that any of the accused had a\n           knowledge that by operating the  plant  on  that  fateful  night\n           whereat such dangerous and highly volatile  substance  like  MIC\n           was stored they had the knowledge that by this very  act  itself\n           they were likely to cause death of any human being.

In other words, the accused should  not\n              be subjected to  unnecessary  or  unduly  long  incarceration\n              prior to his conviction;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_264\">           b) The worry, anxiety, expense and disturbance to  his  vocation\n              and peace, resulting from an unduly prolonged  investigation,\n              inquiry or trial should be minimal; and\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_265\">           c) Undue delay may well result in impairment of the  ability  of\n              the accused to defend himself, whether on account  of  death,\n              disappearance or non-availability of witnesses or otherwise”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_274\">202.  The Court undertook a comprehensive review of  the  earlier  decisions\nin which a remand for a fresh trial was considered inappropriate and  unfair\nto  the  accused  persons  having  regard  to  the  intervening  delay.  The\nfollowing passage is in this regard apposite:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_266\">           “41. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"811142\" id=\"span_49\">In <a href=\"/doc/811142/\" id=\"a_222\">Machander v. State of Hyderabad</a> 1955  CriLJ  1644,  this\n           Court observed that while it is incumbent on the  court  to  see\n           that no guilty person escapes, it is still more its duty to  see\n           that  justice  is  not  delayed  and  accused  persons  are  not\n           indefinitely harassed. The scales, the court observed,  must  be\n           held even between the prosecution and the accused. In the  facts\n           of that case, the court refused to order trial on account of the\n           time already spent and  other  relevant  circumstances  of  that\n           case.</span> In Veerbhadra v. Ramaswamy Naickar 1958 CriLJ  1565,  this\n           Court refused to  send  back  proceedings  on  the  ground  that\n           already a period of five years has elapsed and it would  not  be\n           just and proper in the circumstances of the case to continue the\n           proceedings after such a lapse of time. Similarly, in Chajju Ram\n           v. Radhey Sham [1971] S.C.R. 172, the court refused to direct  a\n           re-trial after a period of 10 years having regard to  the  facts\n           and circumstances of the case. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"346050\" id=\"span_50\">In <a href=\"/doc/346050/\" id=\"a_223\">State  of  U.P.  v. Kapil  Deo\n           Shukla</a> 1972 CriLJ 1214, though the court found the acquittal  of\n           the accused unsustainable, it  refused  to  order  a  remand  or\n           direct a trial after a lapse of 20 years.  It  is,  thus,  clear\n           that even apart from <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_224\">Article 21</a> courts in this country have been\n           cognizant of undue delays in criminal matters and wherever there\n           was inordinate delay or where the proceedings were  pending  for\n           too  long  and  any  further  proceedings  were  deemed  to   be\n           oppressive and unwarranted, they were put an end  to  by  making\n           appropriate orders.”</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_275\">203.  In Machander’s case referred to in the above passage, this  Court  had\nsummed up the position as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_267\">           “…We are not prepared to keep persons who are on trial for their\n           lives under indefinite suspense because trial judges omit to  do\n           their duty. Justice is not one-sided. It has many facets and  we\n           have to draw a  nice  balance  between  conflicting  rights  and\n           duties. While it is incumbent on us to see that  the  guilty  do\n           not escape it is even more necessary to see that persons accused\n           of crime are not indefinitely harassed. They  must  be  given  a\n           fair and impartial trial and  while  every  reasonable  latitude\n           must be given to those concerned with the  detections  of  crime\n           and entrusted with the administration of justice, limits must be\n           placed on the lengths to which they may go.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_268\">           Except in clear cases  of  guilt,  where  the  error  is  purely\n           technical, the forces  that  are  arrayed  against  the  accused\n           should no more be permitted in  special  appeal  to  repair  the\n           effects of their bungling than an accused should be permitted to\n           repairs gaps in his defence which he could  and  ought  to  have\n           made good in the lower courts. The scales  of  justice  must  be\n           kept on an even balance whether for the accused or against  him,\n           whether in favour of the State or not; and one broad  rule  must\n           apply in all cases…”\n\n                                              (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_276\">204.  So also in Ramaswamy Naickar’s case relied upon by this Court  in  the\nabove passage, a fresh inquiry into  the  complaint  after  five  years  was\nconsidered inappropriate.  This Court observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_269\">           “…But the question still remains whether, even after  expressing\n           our strong disagreement with the interpretation of  the  Section\n           by the courts below, this Court should direct a further  inquiry\n           into the complaint, which has stood dismissed for the last about\n           5 years. The action complained of against the  accused  persons,\n           if true, was foolish, to put it mildly,  but  as  the  case  has\n           become stale,  we  do  not  direct  further  inquiry  into  this\n           complaint. If there is a recurrence of such a foolish  behaviour\n           on the part of any Section of the community, we  have  no  doubt\n           that those charged with the duty of maintaining law  and  order,\n           will apply the law in the sense in which we have interpreted the\n           law. The appeal is therefore, dismissed…”\n\n                                            (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_277\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1243336\" id=\"span_51\">205.  To the  same  effect  is  the  decision  of  this  Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/1243336/\" id=\"a_225\">Kantilal\nChandulal Mehta v. The State of Maharashtra and Anr.</a> (1969) 3 SCC 166  where\nthis Court observed:</span>\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_270\">            “…In our view the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_226\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> gives ample power  to\n           the courts to alter or amend a charge whether by the trial court\n           or by the appellate court provided that the accused has not face\n           a charge for a new  offence  or  is  not  prejudiced  either  by\n           keeping him in the dark about that charge or  in  not  giving  a\n           full opportunity of meeting it and putting forward  any  defence\n           open to him, on the charge finally preferred against him…”\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_278\">206.  The incident in the case at hand occurred  about  16  years  ago.   To\nframe a charge for a new offence and remand the matter back for the  accused\nto face a prolonged trial again does not appear to us  to  be  a  reasonable\nproposition. We say so independent of the  finding  that  we  have  recorded\nthat the fact situation the case at hand does not suggest that  the  accused\nAnsal brothers or any one of them, had the  knowledge  that  their  acts  of\nomission or commission was  likely  to  cause  death  of  any  human  being.\nQuestion No.3 is accordingly answered in the negative.\nRe: Question No.IV:\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_279\">207.  We have, in the earlier part of  this  judgment,  while  dealing  with\nQuestion No.I, examined the scope of criminal appeals by special  leave  and\nobserved that this Court may interfere in  such  appeals  only  where  wrong\ninferences of law have been drawn from facts proved  before  the  Courts  or\nwhere the conclusions drawn by the High Court are perverse and based  on  no\nevidence whatsoever. The scope  of  interference  by  this  Court  with  the\nquantum of punishment awarded by the High Court is  also  similarly  limited\nto cases where the sentence awarded is manifestly inadequate and  where  the\nCourt considers such reduced punishment  to  be  tantamount  to  failure  of\njustice. This can be best illustrated by reference to cases  in  which  this\nCourt has interfered to either enhance the punishment awarded  by  the  High\nCourt or remitted the matter back to the High Court for  a  fresh  order  on\nthe subject.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_280\">208.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1486028\" id=\"span_52\">In <a href=\"/doc/1486028/\" id=\"a_227\">Sham Sunder v.

This Court found the reduced sentence imposed by the  High  Court  to\nbe grossly inadequate and held that it amounted to  a  failure  of  justice.\nEnhancing the sentence to five years imprisonment, this Court observed:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_271\">           “3. It is true that the High Court is entitled to reappraise the\n           evidence in the case.

This brings us  to  the  next  question  in  regard  to  the\n           reduction of sentence made by the High Court. In criminal  cases\n           awarding of sentence is not a mere formality. Where the  statute\n           has given the court  a  choice  of  sentence  with  maximum  and\n           minimum limit presented then an element of discretion is  vested\n           with the court. This discretion cannot be exercised  arbitrarily\n           or whimsically.  It  will  have  to  be  exercised  taking  into\n           consideration the gravity of offence, the manner in which it  is\n           committed, the age, the sex of the accused, in other  words  the\n           sentence to be  awarded  will  have  to  be  considered  in  the\n           background of the fact of each case and the court while doing so\n           should bear  in  mind  the  principle  of  proportionality.

The High Court in this case without even noticing  the  fact\n           what is the actual sentence undergone by the appellant  pursuant\n           to his conviction awarded by the Trial Court proceeded to reduce\n           the same to the period already undergone with an added sentences\n           of fine as stated above.  Of  course,  the  High  Court  by  the\n           impugned order recorded that the facts and circumstances of  the\n           case as well as age, character  and  other  antecedents  of  the\n           appellant which made the court feel that  the  ends  of  justice\n           would be met if the  sentence  is  reduced  and  modified.  This\n           conclusion of the High Court for reducing the  sentence  in  our\n           considered view is wholly disproportionate  to  the  offence  of\n           which the appellant is found guilty.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_277\">           11...On facts and circumstances of this case, we must hold  that\n           sentence of 40 days for  an  offence  punishable  under  Section\n           365/511  read  with  Section  149  is  wholly   inadequate   and\n           disproportionate.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_278\">           12.

It is manifest from the above  that  while  exercising  extra-ordinary\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_237\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution this Court has not  acted\nlike an ordinary Appellate Court but has confined its interference  only  to\nsuch rarest  of  rare  situations  in  which  the  sentence  awarded  is  so\nincommensurate with the gravity of the offence that it  amounts  to  failure\nof justice. As a matter of fact in Deo Narain Mandal’s  case  (supra)  while\nthis Court found the sentence  awarded  to  be  wholly  disproportionate  to\ngravity of the offence, this Court considered imprisonment for a  period  of\nsix months to be sufficient for an offence which is punishable by a  maximum\nterm of two years rigorous imprisonment.  Award  of  sentence  of  one  year\nrigorous imprisonment for  an  offence  where  maximum  sentence  prescribed\nextends to two years cannot, therefore, be said to  be  inadequate  to  call\nfor interference by this Court under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_238\">Article 136</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_285\">213.  Having said that  we  must  notice  certain  additional  and  peculiar\nfeatures of this case. First and  foremost  is  the  fact  that  Mr.  Salve,\nlearned counsel for CBI, did not, in the course  of  his  submissions,  urge\nthat the sentence awarded by the High Court to Ansals was  inadequate.  This\nis in contrast to the grounds urged in the memo of appeal by the  CBI  where\nthe inadequacy of sentence  was  also  assailed.   In  the  absence  of  any\nattempt leave alone a serious  one  by  the  State  acting  through  CBI  to\nquestion the correctness of the view taken by the High Court on the  quantum\nof sentence we would consider the ground taken in  the  memo  of  appeal  to\nhave been abandoned at the Bar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_286\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1007347\" id=\"span_57\">214.  The second and an equally important  consideration  that  would  weigh\nwith any Court is the question of prolonged  trial  that  the  accused  have\nfaced and the delay of more than sixteen years  in  the  conclusion  of  the\nproceedings against them. We have in the earlier part of our order  referred\nto the decision of a three-Judge Bench of this Court in  <a href=\"/doc/1007347/\" id=\"a_239\">Hussainara  Khatoon</a>\ncase (supra) where this Court declared the  right  to  speedy  trial  to  be\nimplicit in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_240\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"835358\" id=\"span_58\">Such being the case  delay  has\nbeen often made a basis  for  the  award  of  a  reduced  sentence,  as  for\ninstance in <a href=\"/doc/835358/\" id=\"a_241\">Balaram Swain v.

The third circumstance which dissuades us from  interfering  with  the\nsentence awarded by the High Court is the  fact  that  the  appellant-Ansals\ndid not have any criminal background and are  both  senior  citizens,  whose\ncompany has already been adjudged liable to pay compensation to the  victims\nbesides punitive damages awarded against them. This Court has in MCD,  Delhi\nv. AVUT (supra) arising out of a writ petition seeking compensation for  the\nvictims and their families awarded compensation @ Rs.10 lakhs  in  the  case\nof death of those aged more than 20 years and  7.5  lakhs  in  the  case  of\nthose aged 20 years and less besides compensation  of  Rs.1  lakh  to  those\ninjured in the incident with interest @ 9%  p.a.  and  punitive  damages  of\nRs.25 lakhs. There is no dispute that the amount awarded by the  High  Court\nhas been deposited by the  Ansal  Theaters  &amp;  Clubotels  (P)  Ltd.  in  the\nproportion in which the claim has been awarded. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"61901185\" id=\"span_60\">The  award  so  made  is  in\ntune with the spirit of the view taken  by  this  Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/61901185/\" id=\"a_243\">Ankush  Shivaji\nGaikwad v. State of Maharashtra</a> (2013) 6 SCC 770 where this  Court  noted  a\nglobal paradigm shift away from retributive justice towards  victimology  or\nrestitution in criminal law.</span>  There is no gainsaying that in the absence  of\nthe order passed by this Court in MCD, Delhi v. AVUT (supra),  we  may  have\nourselves determined the compensation payable to  the  victims  and  awarded\nthe same against Ansal brothers. Any such exercise is  rendered  unnecessary\nby the said decision especially because a  reading  of  sub-section  (5)  of\n<a href=\"/doc/1705664/\" id=\"a_244\">Section 357</a> of the Cr.P.C. makes it manifest that compensation awarded by  a\nCriminal Court under Section 357 cannot be more than the  sum  that  may  be\npayable or recovered as  compensation  in  a  subsequent  civil  suit.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"795674\" id=\"span_61\">That\nprovision was interpreted by this Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/795674/\" id=\"a_245\">Dilip  S.  Dahanukar  v.  Kotak\nMahindra Co. Ltd.</a> (2007) 6 SCC 528 to hold that the amount  of  compensation\nunder Section 357 should ordinarily be less than the  amount  which  can  be\ngranted by a civil Court upon appreciation of the  evidence  brought  before\nit for losses that it may have reasonably suffered.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_288\">216.  For all that we have stated above we do  not  see  any  merit  in  the\ncontention of Mr. Tulsi that the punishment awarded to  the  Ansal  brothers\nought to be enhanced either because there is an allegation against them  for\ntampering with the Court’s record or because there is  a  complaint  pending\nagainst them before the learned ACMM in which Ansal brothers  and  their  so\ncalled henchmen  are  accused  of  having  intimidated  and  threatened  the\nPresident of the Victims’ Association. There  is  no  gainsaying  that  both\nthese matters are pending adjudication by the competent criminal  Court  and\nany observation as to the truthfulness of the allegations made therein  will\nnot only be inappropriate but also prejudicial to one or  the  other  party.\nSo also the argument that the Ansal brothers having persistently lied  about\ntheir association with the company does not, in our  opinion,  outweigh  the\nconsiderations that we have indicated hereinabove while upholding  the  view\ntaken by the High Court on the question  of  sentence.  We  need  to  remind\nourselves that award of punishment in a case where guilt of the  accused  is\nproved, is as serious and important a matter  as  the  forensic  process  of\nreasoning by which the presumption of innocence is rebutted and the  accused\npronounced guilty. Like the former the latter also needs  to  be  guided  by\nsound  logic  uninfluenced  by  any  emotional  or  impulsive  outburst   or\nmisplaced sympathy that more often than not manifests itself in the form  of\na  sentence  that  is  either  much  too  heavy  and  oppressive  or  wholly\nincommensurate considering the gravity  of  the  offence  committed.  Courts\nhave to avoid such extremities in their approach especially where  there  is\nno legislative compulsion  or  statutory  prescription  in  the  form  of  a\nminimum sentence for an offence. The Courts do well to avoid the  Shylockian\nheartlessness in demanding the proverbial pound of flesh.  Justice  tempered\nby mercy is what the Courts of law administer  even  to  the  most  hardened\ncriminals.   A spine- chilling sentence may be the cry  of  those  who  have\nsuffered the crime or its aftermath but Courts are duty bound  to  hold  the\nscales of justice even by examining the adequacy of punishment in each  case\nhaving regard to the peculiar facts in which the offence was  committed  and\nthe demands of justice by retribution within permissible limits. Absence  of\na uniform sentencing policy may often make any such endeavour difficult  but\nthe Courts do, as they  ought  to,  whatever  is  fair  and  reasonable  the\ndifficulties, besetting that exercise notwithstanding.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_289\">217.

Adherence to safety standards in cinema theatres  and  multiplexes  in\nIndia is the key to the prevention of tragedies like the one in the  instant\ncase. The misfortune, however, is that those concerned with the  enforcement\nof such standards often turn a blind eye to the violations, in  the  process\nendangering the lives of those who frequent such places. While the  case  at\nhand may be an eye-opener for such of them  as  are  remiss  in  their  duty\ntowards  the  public  visiting  cinema   theatres   and   multiplexes,   the\nauthorities concerned cannot afford to let their guard  down.   As  seen  in\nthe  earlier  part  of  this  order,  there  are  both  civil  and  criminal\nliabilities that arise out of any such neglect. Those who commit  violations\nof the same are accountable before law and  may  eventually  come  to  grief\nshould an incident occur resulting in injury or  loss  of  human  lives.  We\nwould have in the ordinary course issued directions to  the  authorities  to\ntake corrective steps, but for the fact that such  directions  have  already\nbeen issued by a coordinate Bench while dealing with claims for  payment  of\ncompensation made by the legal heirs of those who died and others  who  were\ninjured in the incident.

Having had the benefit of the views and reasonings  assigned  in\nthe judgment and order of Hon’ble Justice T.S. Thakur, I entirely agree  and\nhence concur with the findings recorded therein which are  based  on  an  in\ndepth analysis and meticulous scrutiny of evidence led  by  the  prosecution\nas also the accused appellants therein.  Hence, I approve of the  conviction\nof the accused appellants under Sections 304A, 337, 338  read  with  <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_248\">Section\n36</a> of the Indian Penal Code (‘<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_249\">IPC</a>’ for short) and <a href=\"/doc/1107870/\" id=\"a_250\">Section 14</a> of  the  Indian\nCinematograph Act, 1952.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_301\">2.          However, when  it  comes  to  determination  and  imposition  of\nsentence on the appellants due to their gross criminal  negligence,  I  find\nit difficult  to  be  unmindful  or  ignore  that  this  country   and  more\nparticularly the capital city of Delhi was shocked  and shaken to  the  core\n16 years ago by the magnitude and disastrous  incident which took  place  on\n13.6.1997 in a cinema house now widely known as  Uphaar  Tragedy  which  had\nvirtually turned the cinema house  into a pitch   dark gas chamber   wherein\nthe  cinema viewers were initially trapped due to lack of  sufficient  space\nand light for exit from the cinema hall and finally 59  persons  lost  their\nlives due to asphyxiation in the  catastrophe which is perhaps  unparalleled\nin the history of the city of  Delhi.  This tragic incident happened due  to\ngrave lapse on  the  part  of  the  appellants/respondents  in  the  instant\nappeals preferred by the AVUT and the CBI, who  have  been  held  guilty  of\ngross criminal negligence concurrently by  the  Trial  Court  and  the  High\nCourt which are now being approved by us in these appeals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_302\">3.          The appellants Sushil Ansal and Gopal Ansal in  Criminal  Appeal\nNo. 597 of 2010 and Criminal Appeal No.598  of  2010,  therefore,  had  been\ncharged and convicted for  an offence under  Section  304A,  337,  338  read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_251\">Section 36</a> I.P.C. and <a href=\"/doc/1107870/\" id=\"a_252\">Section 14</a> of the  Cinematograph  Act,  1952  and\nsentenced to  undergo  imprisonment  for  two  years  by  the  trial  court.\nSimilarly, the appellants in Criminal Appeal No.599  of  2010  and  Criminal\nAppeal No.617 to 627 of 2010 and Criminal Appeal No.604  of  2010  preferred\nby the Divisional Fire Officer H.S. Panwar  and  Officers  of  Delhi  Vidyut\nBoard (shortly referred to as ‘DVB’) were also convicted  and  sentenced  to\nterms of imprisonment specified in the impugned judgment and  order  of  the\nHigh Court of Delhi. On appeal, however, the High Court although upheld  the\nconviction of the appellants/respondents herein under the sections  referred\nto hereinbefore, was pleased to reduce the sentence of two  years  into  one\nyear  but the appellants/respondents herein have still preferred a batch  of\nappeals in this Court challenging their conviction and sentence  on  several\ngrounds.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_303\">4.          Learned Justice T.S. Thakur in the  accompanying   judgment  and\norder has already  dealt  with  the  matter  in  extensive  detail  and  has\nrecorded a finding upholding their conviction  and  sentence  under  Section\n304A alongwith the other Sections.  I fully  endorse  the  same   and  hence\nuphold the conviction of the appellants under Section 304A,  337,  338  read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/615115/\" id=\"a_253\">Section 36</a> of the IPC and <a href=\"/doc/1107870/\" id=\"a_254\">Section 14</a> of the Cinematograph Act, 1952.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_304\">5.          But with regard to the question of sentence,  it  may  be  noted\nthat the trial court  had convicted the appellants and  sentenced   them  to\nimprisonment for two years which has been reduced  by   the  High  Court  to\none year only in spite of the  fact  that the High  Court  also  upheld  the\nfindings of  the trial court on the charge under Section   304A   and  other\nallied sections  referred to  hereinbefore.   However,  the  High  Court  in\nspite of its finding highlighting the magnitude and gravity of the   offence\ncommitted by the appellants has simply observed that  the  maximum  sentence\nof two years under Section 304A is fit to be reduced  to  a  period  of  one\nyear  only  for    which   no   specific    reason    much    less    cogent\n and   convincing   has been assigned as to why  in the wake of\n\nthe finding upholding the charge and  conviction  under  <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_255\">Section  304A</a>  IPC,\nshould not have upheld and maximum sentence of two  years  and  whether  the\nsame was fit to be reduced to a  period  of  one  year  only.   But,  before\ndealing with the question of quantum and sufficiency of  punishment  imposed\non the appellant, I deem it appropriate   to  take  into  consideration  the\nappeal filed by the appellant-Association  for  victims  of  Uphaar  Tragedy\n(shortly referred to as ‘the AVUT’) bearing Criminal Appeal  No.600-602/2010\nfiled by the AVUT in a representative capacity for  the  victims  of  Uphaar\nTragedy as also the appeal filed by the C.B.I.  bearing  No.605  to  616  of\n2010.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_305\">6.          Learned Senior Counsel  Mr.  K.T.S.  Tulsi  in  support  of  the\nappeal  preferred by the AVUT had initially  challenged  the  charge  framed\nagainst the accused appellants under Section 304A  and  had  contended  that\nthe charge was fit to be converted  under  Section  304  Part  II  <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_256\">IPC</a>.   On\nperusal of  the  findings,  views  and  observations  as  also  the  reasons\nassigned therein by Hon’ble Thakur, J.,  I entirely agree  that  after  more\nthan 16 years  of the incident, it would not be  just  and  appropriate   to\nremand the matter back to  the  trial  court   to  consider  converting  the\ncharge from <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_257\">Section 304A</a> to <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_258\">304</a> IPC so that the accused may  face  prolonged\ntrial all over again as  I am   also  equally   of    the   view   that   it\nwould  not  be   reasonable or a just proposition and the correct course  of\naction to adopt.  However,  this  does  not  deter  me  from  accepting  the\ncontention  of the counsel for the AVUT that even if this  Court   considers\nthat at this  length  of time from the date  of   the  incident  ordering  a\nfresh trail  may not be  in the larger public interest, it would  not  be  a\nreason to refuse to  consider  whether   accused-appellants   deserved   the\nmaximum sentence permissible under <a href=\"/doc/1371604/\" id=\"a_259\">Section 304A</a> IPC in spite of the  gravity\nof charge and conviction which we have upheld.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_306\">7.          In order to consider this  crucial  aspect  of  the  matter,  it\nwould be  necessary to recollect and refer to the findings recorded  by  the\ntrial court and the High Court approved by us which learned  Thakur  J.  has\nanalyzed in great detail holding that the  death  of  59  innocent   persons\nare directly relatable to the rash and  negligent   acts  of  omissions  and\ncommissions of the accused persons which  were  performed  with  such  gross\nnegligence  and  indifference which clearly  amounts  to  culpable  criminal\nnegligence and failure to exercise  reasonable and proper  care  in  running\nthe cinema shows in their theatre namely Uphaar  and  the  failure   of  the\naccused-appellants to perform the imperative  duties   cast  upon  them   by\nstatutory rules, which  were  sufficient   to  establish  culpable  criminal\nrashness and it further establishes that they acted with  consciousness  and\nthe requisite knowledge  as to the consequence   of their acts of  omissions\nand commissions.   Death of innocent persons is thus  not  only  contributed\nby the actions  of the accused-appellants  but is  directly   relatable   to\nthe overt acts and conscious omissions  performed by them.   Hence, I  fully\nagree with the views of learned Brother Justice Thakur that  the  degree  of\ncare expected from an  occupier/owner   of  a  place  which  is   frequented\neveryday  by hundreds if not thousands   is very high in comparison  to  any\nother  place that is less frequented  or more  sparingly   used  for  public\nfunctions.  It is also equally true and I agree that the higher  the  number\nof visitors to a place and  greater  the  frequency  of   such  visits,  the\ndegree of care required to be observed  for  their  safety  is  higher.   I,\ntherefore, endorse the findings  recorded by Thakur J.,  that judged in  the\nabove backdrop, it is evident that the occupiers/appellants in  the  present\ncase had showed scant regard both for the  letter of law as  also  the  duty\nunder the common law to care for the  safety  of  their  patrons.    I  also\nfurther  agree  with  the  view  that  the  occupiers  not  only   committed\ndeviations from the sanctioned building plan that  heightened  the  risk  to\nthe  safety  of  the  visitors  but  continued  to  operate  the  cinema  in\ncontemptuous  disregard for the requirements  of law   and  in  the  process\nexposed the  cine goers to a  high degree of risk to their lives which  some\nof them  eventually  lost in the incident  in question.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_307\">8.          Far from taking any additional care towards the  safety  of  the\nvisitors to the cinema,  the  occupiers    asked  for  permission  to  place\nadditional seats that further  compromised   with  the  safety  requirements\nand raised the level of risks to the  patrons.  There is much substance   in\nthe view taken  that the history of litigation  between  the  occupiers   on\nthe one hand and the government on the other regarding  the removal of   the\nadditional seats permitted and their  opposition to the  concerns  expressed\nby the authorities  on account of  increased  fire  hazards  as  also  their\ninsistence  that the addition or continuance of the seats would  not  affect\nthe safety requirements of the patrons/cine goers clearly  showed  that  the\nowner of the cinema house  were more  concerned  with making a  little  more\nprofit  out of  the few additional seats that  were added to the  cinema  in\nthe balcony rather than maintaining the  required  standards  of  safety  in\ndischarge   of the common law duty but also under  the  provisions   of  the\nDelhi Cinematograph Rules,1953 (for short ‘DCR  1953’).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_308\">9.          It is no doubt true which was  urged  on   behalf   of  accused-\nappellants that the incident in question  which  resulted  in  death  of  59\npersons in the fire that broke out was caused  by  the  fire  which  started\nfrom  the Delhi Vidyut Board Transformer which  was  poorly  maintained  and\nshabbily repaired by the  Delhi Vidyut Board officials  in  the  morning  of\n13th June, 1997.  It was urged that the  causa causans  i.e.  the  cause  of\nall causes for the loss of human lives thus was the transformer that  caught\nfire because of the negligence of the DVB officials  who did not  even  have\na crimping  machine to repair the transformer properly.  The absence of  oil\nsoaking  pit in the transformer room was also  a  reason  for  the   oil  to\nspill  out from the transformer room to spread   the  fire  to  the  parking\narea from where smoke   containing  lethal carbon monoxide rose, and due  to\nchimney effect , entered the hall to cause asphyxiation to those inside  the\nbalcony.   It   was,  therefore,   urged  on   behalf   of   the    accused-\nappellants/cinema house owners that there was no  evidence  that  any  death\nhad taken place inside the balcony which proved that most  if  not  all  the\npatrons sitting in the balcony had  exited   from  that  area  but  died  on\naccount of the  poisonous  effect of the gas enough  to  kill   human  being\nwithin minutes      of exposure.   Placing reliance  on  the  ratio  of  the\ndecision of this Court in the  case of  Kurban Hussein’s  case  reported  in\n1965 (2) SCR 622, it was no doubt submitted that the  causa  causans      in\nthe case at hand was the fire in the DVB transformer  and  not  the  alleged\ndeviations  in  the  building  plan  or  the  sitting  arrangements  or  the\nobstructions in the  stair case that  led out of  the cinema precincts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_309\">10.         In fact, learned counsel representing the CBI Mr.  Harish  Salve\nand the counsel representing AVUT Mr. KTS Tulsi  accepted the position  that\nwhile there was no quarrel  with the proposition that  death must  be  shown\nto have occurred  as a direct, immediate or proximate  result of the act  of\nrashness or negligence, it was not  correct to say that the deaths  in  this\ncase had occurred merely because of the fire in the transformer.   In  fact,\nfailure of the victims to rapidly exit from the smoke filled  atmosphere  in\nthe  balcony area  because of the obstructions  and  deviations   proved  at\nthe trial  was the real, direct   and immediate cause for the  death of  the\nvictims in the instant case  who would have safely  escaped  the   poisonous\ncarbon monoxide  gas only if there were proper  gangways,  exits,  emergency\nlights  and  alarm  system  in  working  condition  and   human   assistance\navailable to those trapped  inside the  hall.  I see no reason to differ  or\ndisagree with this finding  so as to take a different view  from  what   has\nbeen taken by Hon’ble Justice Thakur who has  upheld  the  findings  of  the\ntrial court and the High Court on these aspects.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_310\">11.         Thus there appears to be  two features  in  this  context  which\nneed to be addressed and the  first  one    is  that   the  victims  in  the\npresent case did not die of burn injuries but all of them  died  because  of\nasphyxiation  on account of  prolonged exposure  to  poisonous  gases   that\nfilled the cinema hall including the balcony area.  Whatever may  have  been\nthe source of  fire  as to whether it was caused by the DVB  transformer  or\notherwise, the causa  sine quo non  was that there would have been no  smoke\n possible without fire; the proximate cause  was the smoke  in  the  balcony\narea. Had there been no smoke in the balcony area, there would have been  no\ncasualties; that is not however the same thing  as saying  that it  was  the\nfire or the resultant smoke that was causa causans.   In fact  it  was   the\ninability of the  victims  to move out of the smoke filled  area  which  was\nthe direct cause of their  death.   Placed  in  a  smoke  filled  atmosphere\nanyone  would  distinctively  try  to  escape  from  it   to  save  himself.\nTherefore, if such escapes were delayed or prevented,   the   causa  causans\nfor death was not the smoke but  the  factors that prevented or delayed  the\n  escape  of   cine  goers from the\n\nsmoke filled area which was the cinema house  which got  converted  into   a\ngas chamber.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_311\">12.         I find sufficient substance and force and hence agree  with  the\nview taken  by  Hon’ble   Justice  Thakur   that  even  if  there  had  been\nadequate number of exits, gangways  and   all  other  safety  measures    in\nplace  but the exits had been locked preventing people from   escaping,  the\ncause of  death in such event would be the act of   preventing  people  from\nfleeing/exiting  from the smoke filled hall which   may  be  depending  upon\nwhether  the act was deliberately intended to cause death or unintended  due\nto negligence amounting  to culpable homicide   amounting  to  murder  which\nwas an act of  gross  negligence   punishable   under  Section  304  A.   An\nhypothetical  case  has rightly  been  relied  upon  to   infer  that  where\ninstead of  four exits required  under the relevant rules, the  owner  of  a\ncinema had provided only one exit, that would  have  prevented  the  patrons\nfrom moving  out of the  hall rapidly from  the  smoke   filled  atmosphere.\nThus, the cause of all causes termed as  ‘causa  causans’     would  be  the\nnegligent act of providing  only one exit instead of four required  for  the\npurpose.  In such an eventuality, it would make  no difference  whether  the\nfire had started from a source within the  cinema  complex  or  outside   or\nwhether the  occupiers of the cinema  were  responsible   for  the  fire  or\nsomeone else.  Thus if failure  to exit was the  immediate  cause  of  death\nwhich is the view  taken by  learned Justice Thakur and I  agree,  that  the\nsame would constitute the causa causans  and  hence  I  see  no   reason  to\ndeviate from the  view taken as  I find  sufficient   substance   and  force\nin the view that the smoke entered  the cinema hall   and  the  balcony  but\nescape was prevented  or at least delayed  because of breach  of the  common\nlaw and statutory duty to care.  Reference of the citations  on  this  point\nrelied upon by Justice  Thakur   in  the  accompanying  judgment  needs   no\nfurther reiteration  which  has   been   amply  discussed  at  great  length\ntherein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_312\">13.         The defence no doubt has relied  upon the principle of   benefit\nof penal immunity that if the  person  doing  an  act  is  acting   under  a\nmistake of fact and the person doing the act in good faith believes  himself\n to be justified  by  law  in  doing  it,  then  he  would  be  entitled  to\nprotection under <a href=\"/doc/1180351/\" id=\"a_260\">Section 52</a> of the IPC which states “that  nothing  is  said\nto  be done or  believed in “good faith” which is done or  believed  without\ndue care and attention” would incur penal consequences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_313\">14.         The use of expression “good faith” in this  context  necessarily\nbrings in the question whether the person concerned had acted with due  care\nand caution.  If they had not, part (b) of  <a href=\"/doc/1918278/\" id=\"a_261\">Section 79</a>  IPC  would  have  no\napplication to the case.  In this context, it is difficult to  overlook  the\nevidence addressed  by  the  prosecution/C.B.I.   Thus  the  view  taken  by\nJustice Thakur that due care  for the safety of the  patrons was  cast  upon\nthe two appellants Ansal Brothers  fell  upon  them  which  they  failed  to\ncomply as the evidence adduced at the  trial  and  the  concurrent  findings\nrecorded by  the courts below  have established the breach of  the  duty  in\nseveral respects which include  absence of any   public  address  system  to\nwarn the viewers of the cinema inside the cinema hall in the  event  of  any\nemergency which was a part of the duty to care which  was  grossly  breached\nby the occupiers/appellants herein. This duty was  a  continuing  obligation\nand  had  to  be  strictly  discharged  in  respect  of   each  cinema  show\nconducted in the theatre.  The grant of license   or  its  renewal   by  the\nlicensing  authority  did not  in any manner relieve the occupiers  of  that\nobligation.  Similarly, the requirement that the cinema house must have  had\nemergency lights, fire extinguishers  and  that  the  occupiers   must  have\nprovided help to the viewers  in  case  of  any  emergency  ensuring   rapid\ndispersal  from the enclosed area,  were  obligations  which  were  implicit\nin the  issuance and renewal of  cinematograph  license.     Breach  of  all\nthese obligations  could not be justified  on the  ground   that  a  license\nwas granted or renewed in favour of the owners/licensee and no matter  what,\nthe duty to care towards  the safety of the  patrons was grossly   neglected\nby the theatre  owners/ the accused appellants.  Failures  in the event   of\n mishap like the one  at hand on account  of  the  occupiers   to  discharge\ntheir legal obligations to take care for the safety  of  the  patrons   thus\ncannot be held to be  immune\n\n from  prosecution simply because a license  to   exhibit   the   films  had\nbeen granted or renewed from time to time.   The test of  ordinary  prudence\napplied to  such proved  attendant circumstances thus can  help  the   court\nto determine  whether  an act or omission was in good faith or otherwise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_314\">15.         Thus, the finding recorded in the judgment by Thakur J., to  the\neffect that the fundamental   obligation and  duty  to  care  at  all  times\nrested with the occupiers of the cinema house and the  licensee  thereof  is\nfit to be upheld.  In discharge   of  the  duty  the  appellants/owners  are\nsurely not entitled to  argue that   so long as there  was  a  license    in\ntheir favour, they would not be  accountable for the loss of  life  or  limb\nof anyone  qua  whom the occupiers/owners owed that duty.  The duty to  care\nfor the safety of the   cine  goers   even   independent  of  the  statutory\nadditions made to the same , required the occupiers to take all  such  steps\nand measures which would have ensured  quick dispersal    from  the   cinema\nbuilding   of all the viewers inside  the  premises  in  the  event  of   an\nemergency.  But apart from that, a sitting plan which was in breach  of  the\nstatutory provisions and  compromised  the  safety  requirement   prescribed\nunder the DCR 1953,  could hardly support  a  belief   in  good  faith  that\nexhibition of films with such a plan was  legally  justified.   That  is  so\nespecially  when the  repeal of notification dated 30th September   1976  by\nwhich Uphaar was permitted 100 more seats was   followed  by  a  demand  for\nremoval of the additional seats.  Instead of doing so the  appellants/owners\n challenged that demand  in a writ petition before the High Court  of  Delhi\nin which the High Court  directed the authorities   to  have  a  fresh  look\nfrom the standpoint of substantial compliance   of  the  provisions  of  the\n<a href=\"/doc/980182/\" id=\"a_262\">Cinematograph Act</a>. The High Court observed and directed  the  administration\nto apply their mind  to the additional seats with a view to determine  which\nof them  have contravened which rules  and to what extent.  It was  observed\nthat compliance with the rule were to be substantial   and  not   rigid  and\ninflexible.  If while carrying out  the  above  directive,  the  authorities\nconcerned  turned a blind  eye   to  the   fundamentals  of  the  rules   by\nignoring  the closure of the right side exit and gangway prescribed  as   an\nessential requirement under DCR 1953, they acted in breach of the rules  and\n in the  process endangered the  safety  of  the  cinema  viewers.       The\ncinema      owners had opposed the  removal of  the  additional  seats  even\nwhen  the   respondent-authorities   in  the  writ  petition  had  expressed\nconcerns  about the  safety of the patrons if  the  additional   seats  were\nnot  removed which removal would  have by itself   resulted  in  restoration\nof the  right side gangway.   However, the authorities also  ought  to  have\ninsisted on the restoration of the right side exit  by removal of the  eight\nseaters box  which was allowed  in the year  1978  ostensibly  because  with\nthe right side gangway getting closed by additional  seats  occupying   that\nspace, the authorities  considered the continuance of the  right  side  exit\nto be of no  practical use.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_315\">16.         In the wake of the aforesaid concurrent findings,  the  question\nlooms  large as to why the  High  Court   interfered  with  the  quantum  of\npunishment imposed by the trial court which had  awarded a sentence  of  two\nyears  to the accused  appellants  but was reduced by the High Court   to  a\nperiod of one year without any reason as I cannot be unmindful of the  legal\nposition that the scope  of  interference on the  question of  sentence  and\nwith the quantum of  punishment awarded by the High  Court   is  undoubtedly\nlimited  to cases where  the  sentence  imposed  is  manifestly   inadequate\nand which the  Court considers such reduced punishment  tantamount   to   no\npunishment or illusory.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_316\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1486028\" id=\"span_62\">17.         On a perusal  of the ratios of cases referred to  on this  point\nspecially in the matter of  <a href=\"/doc/1486028/\" id=\"a_263\">Sham Sunder vs.  Puran and Anr.</a>   (1990)  4  SCC\n731, it has been held  that in a case where  the  sentence  imposed  by  the\nHigh Court appears to be so grossly and  entirely inadequate as to   involve\n a failure  of  justice,  this Court would be justified in  interfering  and\nenhancing the sentence and hence the period undergone awarded  by  the  High\nCourt was increased to a period of five years in a case  under  Section  304\nPart I <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_264\">IPC</a> considering the nature of offence committed  by  the  accused  as\nthis Court  has unequivocally held that  in  criminal  cases,   awarding  of\nsentence is not  a mere formality and whenever this Court  is  of  the  view\nthat the sentence awarded is wholly   disproportionate  to  the  crime,   it\nwould be justified in substituting it with a sentence of higher degree   and\nquantum.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_317\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1635251\" id=\"span_63\">18.         It has been held that where the statute has given  the  Court  a\nchoice of sentence  with maximum and minimum limit presented, an element  of\ndiscretion is surely vested with the court  but this  discretion  cannot  be\nexercised arbitrarily  or  whimsically.    It  will  have  to  be  exercised\ntaking into consideration  the gravity  of offence, the manner in which   it\nis committed, the age, the sex  of the accused, in other words the  sentence\nto be awarded will have to be  considered   in the background  of  the  fact\nof each case and the Court  while  doing  so   should  bear  in   mind   the\nprinciple of proportionality that the sentence  awarded  should  be  neither\nexcessively harsh nor ridiculously  low.   This was the view expressed by  a\nthree Judge Bench of this Court  delivered in  the  matter  of   <a href=\"/doc/1635251/\" id=\"a_265\">Deo  Narain\nMandal vs. State of U.P.</a>  (2004) 7 SCC 257, wherein  the  trial  court   had\nawarded   a maximum sentence of two years R.I. for an  offence    punishable\nunder <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_266\">Section 365</a> IPC but the  High  Court   reduced  the  sentence  to  the\nperiod undergone (40  days).    A  bench  of  three  Judges  of  this  Court\nintervened in the matter on the ground that the sentence awarded was  wholly\ndisproportionate to the crime  and  hence  substituted  a  sentence  of  six\nmonths R.I.   Similarly, the ratio of the  cases  already  referred  to   by\nJustice Thakur   in his judgment   viz.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"315677\" id=\"span_64\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"666067\" id=\"span_65\"><a href=\"/doc/666067/\" id=\"a_267\">State  of  U.P.  vs.  Shri  Kishan</a>\n(2005) 10 SCC 420;  <a href=\"/doc/315677/\" id=\"a_268\">State of M.P. vs.  Ghanshaym Singh</a> (2003) 8 SCC  13  and\nState of M.P. vs.  Sangaram  and Ors. AIR 2006 SC  48   unequivocally   have\nlaid down that  where  sentence  is  wholly  inadequate,  the  same  may  be\nenhanced  which has to be  commensurate with the   gravity  of  the  offence\nso that  it may not amount to failure of justice.     In  all  these  cases,\nwhen  this Court found the sentence awarded by the High Court to  be  wholly\ndisproportionate  to the gravity  of  offence  and  considered  imprisonment\nof a longer period which befitted the  gravity of the offence  committed  by\nthe accused, it enhanced  the quantum of sentence.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_318\">19.         It is  most  certainly true that  the award of   punishment   to\nan accused in a case wherein the guilt of the  accused   is  proved,   is  a\nserious   and important matter and  the same needs to be  guided  by   sound\nlogic  uninfluenced by any   emotional or impulsive outburst  or   misplaced\nsympathy that more often than  not,  manifest itself    in  the  form  of  a\nsentence    that is  either much  too heavy and  oppressive   or  wholly  in\ncommensurate considering  the gravity of the offence committed.   Courts  in\nany view have to avoid such extremities  in their approach   specially  when\nthere is no legislative compulsion or statutory  prescription  in  the  form\nof  a minimum sentence for an offence committed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_319\">20.         Bearing the aforesaid parameters and  the  principles   in  mind\nand in the light of findings recorded concurrently and approved  by  us,   I\nhave not been able to convince  myself or feel persuaded  or  find  a  valid\nreason why the High Court should have reduced the sentence   of  two   years\nawarded by the trial court by reducing   it to one year in the wake of   the\nfinding   recorded by us also as we have held that all the  accused  owed  a\nduty of care to the deceased persons since  accused  Sushil  Ansal  and  A-2\nGopal Ansal  were  in  actual  control  of  the  premises  and  took  active\nparticipation in the day to day management of the theatre.   They  were  the\nactual decision makers without whose approval no action could be  undertaken\nin the premises.  A-1 was the licensee of the cinema and had the  obligation\nto run it with due and reasonable care.  A-2 as  the  Managing  Director  of\nAnsal Properties &amp; Industries Ltd had exercised complete  control  over  the\nmanagement of the theatre.   They  were  the  actual  beneficiaries  of  the\nestablishment who were making out financial gains by  charging  the  public.\nAs persons in charge of a public entertainment centre which  caters  to  the\ngeneral public they owed a duty of care to maintain a safe environment.   It\nwould be indeed very far fetched to contend that a person  who  maintains  a\ncinema hall and charges the public a fee for the facility, does  not  owe  a\nduty of care to ensure that the public can enjoy  the  facility  in  a  safe\nenvironment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_320\">21.         In the present case every rule in the  book  had  been  violated\nwith impunity, whether it be the maintenance  of  the  transformer,  illegal\nuser of the area around the transformer, closure of  gangways  and  exit  in\nthe balcony.  Not  only  that  the  transformer  was  not  kept  in  a  safe\nenvironment,  the  area  around  the  transformer  had  been   filled   with\ncombustible  substances  so  as  to  aggravate  the  danger.    The   public\nannouncement  system,  emergency  lights  etc  which  are  the  most   basic\nrequirements in the cinema hall were non functional.  On top  of  that,  the\nillegal closure of exit in the balcony ensured that patrons could  not  make\na speedy exit.  All these decision were taken by A-1 and  A-2  who  were  in\nactive control of the theatre and the premises.  In such a scenario  it  can\neasily be said that not only were they negligent but the negligence  was  of\nsuch a high degree that no reasonable  man  would  have  undertaken  such  a\ncourse specially the ones who were dealing in  the  business  of  running  a\ncinema theatre where the lives of public at large were involved day  in  and\nday out as visitors to the cinema show.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_321\">22.         The  death  of  the  deceased  in  the   tragedy   occurred  due\nto the trap created   for  them  by  A-1  and  A-2  along   with  the  other\nactors   who   helped   them   achieve that end.   Had  the  layout  of  the\nbalcony not   been   changed   from the   sanctioned   plan   to   such   an\nextent  that  access  to the  right  hand  exit was\n\ntotally blocked, this tragedy would  not  have  taken  place.   Due  to  the\nblockage of the right hand exit the patrons were  forced  to  use  both  the\nleft hand exits which opened on the smoke filled left hand stairs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_322\">23.         The conduct of A-1 and  A-2/respondents  in  these  appeals  was\nthus in total disregard of all the safety rules meant to contain  a  tragedy\nof this kind coupled with the knowledge of the 1989  fire  which  had  taken\nplace earlier in the Uphaar theatre.  The culpability of  the  accused  thus\nclearly brings them within the four corners of Section 304  as  it  lies  in\nthe knowledge that such a tragedy was possible and in fact had  taken  place\nin 1989 in an identical  manner.   But  rather  than  taking  stock  of  the\nsituation they chose to carry on in the same manner as  before  in  reckless\ndisregard to the consequence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_323\">24.         This    shows   that    the  appellants  /  respondents   herein\nSushil   Ansal  and   Gopal  Ansal   had     knowledge         that      the\ntransformer     located   on   the    ground    floor     was      dangerous\nto the  paying     patrons    visiting    the  cinema.     This     incident\nclearly established    that    the  owners/  directors  /  Licencee      and\nmanagement   were     aware   of\n\nthe fact that the transformers posed a potential danger of a major fire  and\nof the hall and balcony getting smoked up  ‘chimney  effect’.   Inaction  on\nthe part of A-1 and A-2 despite the pendency of  case  regarding  suspension\nof their  license  continued  although  a  major  fire  had  broken  out  on\n06.07.1989  at  11.40  P.M.  in  identical  circumstances  when   both   the\ntransformers i.e. the transformer of the Cinema as well as  the  transformer\nof DESU burnt and smoke reached right up to the balcony,  but  no  step  was\ntaken to rectify the situation.  The Licence was  neither  revoked  nor  was\nthe matter brought to the notice of Hon’ble High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_324\">FAULTY REPAIR OF THE TRANSFORMER\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_325\">25.         Besides the above, it has further come out in  evidence  led  by\nthe CBI and referred to extensively, that the cable  end  socket  of  the  B\nphase of LT supply, cable of the transformer had not been fixed properly  by\nA-9 (B M Satija), A-10 (A.K. Gera) &amp; A-11 (Bir Singh) of DESU. The same  had\nbeen fixed by hammering and not by crimping  machine  or  any  other  proper\nsystem as provided under BIS 1255, 1983. Thus the  short  circuit  resulting\nin the fire could have been avoided had the cables been  properly  repaired.\nAs per the Report of electrical Inspector NCT  of  Delhi  Shri  K.L.  Grover\n(EX. PW 24/A), the cable and socket of “B” phase of  LT  supply  cables  had\nnot been fixed  properly  as  the  same  appeared  to  have  been  fixed  by\nhammering and not by the crimping machine or any  other  proper  system.  In\nhis deposition, he has further clarified that the LT PVC  cable  socket  was\nnot crimped as required under the provision of IS Code 1255 of 1983 r/w  sub\nrule 2 of Rule 29 of Rule 1956. The HT  circuits  were  not  found  provided\nwith protection system. The OCB were acting like as manual isolator and  not\nas OCB’s as they could not  have  been  tripped  automatically  in  case  of\nabnormal condition of supply.  The  1000  KVA  transformer  was  not  having\nsufficient clearances as required under IS  1886/1967.  No  arrangement  for\ndraining  out  of  transformer  oil  in  case  of  damage/rapture   to   the\ntransformer was found  which  is  mandatory  as  per  the  provision  of  IS\n1886/1967 &amp; IS 10028/1981.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_326\">26.         As is clear from the deposition of PW48 S  K  Bahl  (Addl  Chief\nEngineer DVB), the staff of the DVB were obliged to follow the BIS  standard\nwhich provided crimping for fixing of loose  cables.  He  deposed  that  the\nCrimping Machines are provided for the purpose of crimping the  socket  with\nLT leads of  the  transformer.  This  was  only  to  secure  that  no  loose\nconnections are made which could give rise to high temperature resulting  in\nburning of leads at times. ….It was obligatory  for  the  staff  of  DVB  to\nfollow the Indian Standards &amp; DVB Manual for both installation  as  well  as\nmaintenance of substation equipment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_327\">27.          Thus the evidence adduced by the appellant CBI and referred  to\nin great detail in support of their  appeal  establishes  that  due  to  the\nfaulty repair of the transformer the connection of the cable end  socket  of\nthe B phase of LT supply remained loose which  resulted  in  sparking.  This\ncoupled with 1000    KVA current which was passing through  these  bus  bars\n     led to excessive heating. This caused a  cavity  on  the  B       phase\nand melting of the upper portion of cable end socket.  Thus  the  cable  and\nsocket came out from the bolt portion  and  hit  the  radiator  fin  of  the\ntransformer. The live conductor of the cable (whose  insulation  had  melted\ndue to  the  heating)  formed  an  opening  in  the  radiator  fin  and  the\ntransformer oil gushed  out  and  caught  fire.   Reports  of  KV  Singh  EE\nElectrical PWD (PW 35/A), Report of Electrical  Inspector,  NCT,  Shri  K.L.\nGrover (PW 24/A), Report of Dr. Rajinder Singh (CFSL) (PW 64/B)]  have  been\nreferred to by the appellant CBI in their appeal.  The above  findings  thus\nhave rightly been affirmed  by  the  Hon’ble  High  Court  in  the  impugned\njudgment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_328\">28.         I have further taken note of the fact that the transformer  room\nwas not ventilated as  per  the  prescribed  BIS  Rules.  (Clauses  7.3.1.1,\n7.3.1.2, 7.3.1.4, 7.9.3 of the BIS rules). In fact,  the  open  space  above\nthe parapet behind the transformer room from where smoke could  have  easily\ngone outside the building was closed. Instead of the  parapet  as  reflected\nin the sanctioned  plan  there  was  a  full  wall  behind  the  transformer\neffectively trapping the  fire  and  the  smoke  within  the  building.  The\nsanctioned plan showed a parapet behind the transformer room as per  PW  15-\nY/11 which is a low wall built along the edge of a roof or a floor not  more\nthan 3ft. in height” in the Building Byelaws 1959.  So  the  height  of  the\nwall behind the transformer could not have been more than 3  feet  according\nto the sanction plan.  But as is clear from the various  reports  there  was\nfull fledged wall behind the transformer.  The Report of MCD Engineers  (Ex.\nPW2/A) also states that in the rear a pucca wall marked A-B in the  existing\nstilt plan has been constructed in full  height  of  building  whereas  this\nwall in stilt floor has been shown open upto  a  height  of  12  ft  in  the\nsanctioned plan.  This  was  a  serious  violation  against  the  sanctioned\nbuilding plan. The same was  reiterated  in  Report  of  PWD  Engineers  (EX\nPW29/A) which states that outer wall behind HT/LT room  was  constructed  up\nto the First Floor height instead of  3ft  height.   In  addition  PW2  R.N.\nGupta (EE) MCD and PW 29 B. S.Randhawa  (AE)  PWD  have  also  deposed  that\nouter wall behind HT transformer and LT room was found constructed upto  the\nfirst floor height instead of 3 feet height.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_329\">29.         I have further noted that A9 to A11  conducted  improper  repair\nof the DVB Transformer in  the  morning  of  13.6.97  without  the  help  of\ncrimping  machine  which  resulted  in  loose  fitting/connections   causing\nsparking in between the B Phase of the transformer, causing a  hole  in  the\nradiator fin resulting in leakage of transformer oil which  caught  fire  on\naccount of the rise in the temperature due to the sparking and the  improper\nrepairs of the transformer which is established from the  Repair  Report  Ex\nPW 108/AA, EX PW 40/C: the entry of repair, PW 40 PC Bharadwaj AE DVB  &amp;  PW\n44 Bhagwandeen. The contention of B. M. Satija that he  was  not  posted  in\nsubstation zone 1601 is incorrect as is clear from Ex. PW 48 E  which  is  a\nletter from S.K. Bahl Addl. Chief Engineer to SP CBI (PW 48) dated  30.07.97\nin reply to query from SP CBI. In reply to query No. 3,  he  clearly  stated\nthat B.M. Satija was entrusted the work of Substation  zone  1601  of  Dist.\nR.K. Puram. Uphaar Cinema which substation fell under jurisdiction  of  zone\n1601, Capital work order 19.5.1997 vide (Ex PW 43/DC).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_330\">CULPABILITY OF THE SUPERVISOR OR INSPECTOR\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_331\">30.         In the present case, A-9 to A-11 i.e.  the  Inspectors  and  the\nfitter of DVB were in charge of the maintenance of  the  transformer   which\nis a hazardous object. As electricians they should have known  that  by  its\nvery nature a transformer of such high capacity  stored  inside  a  building\nrequired proper maintenance and any lapse on their part would  endanger  the\nlife of all the occupant of the  building  and  neighbourhood.  The  callous\nmanner of repair by these accused resulted in the  outbreak  of  fire  which\nfinally resulted in a mass tragedy. A-15  is  the  Divisional  Officer  with\nDFS.  It was his duty to inspect the  building  for  the  fire  hazards  and\nensure that it was a safe place for the public.  The  illegalities  and  the\nviolations committed by the management of the Cinema  would  not  have  been\npossible without willful dereliction of duty by this accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_332\">31.         Thus the very persons who had been deputed to  keep  the  public\nsafe connived with the management  to  turn  a  blind  eye  to  the  hazards\ncreated in the building. The conduct of this accused  is  nothing  short  of\nreckless which finally led to the death of 59 persons as the transformer  in\nquestion i.e. D.V.B. Transformer did not have following safety  measures  at\nthe time of inspection:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_294\">i)    The L.T. Side cables from the bus bar did not have clamping system  or\n      any support to the cables.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_295\">ii)   The earth cable of the transformer had been found  temporarily  fitted\n      with the earth strip i.e. twisting of earth cable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_296\">iii)  There was no cable trench to conceal the cable.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_297\">iv)   H.T. Panel Board of transformer did not have any relay system to  trip\n      the transformer in case of any fault.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_298\">v)    The Buchholtz Relay system was not fitted on the transformer.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_299\">vi)   Temperature meter was not found fitted on the transformer.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_333\">32.         The physical examination of D.V.B. transformer reveals that  the\ncables on bus bars on L.T. side did not have check nuts.  Except  one  lower\nterminal of phase Y and neutral terminal. The check nut of neutral  terminal\nwas found in loose condition. The blue phase single cable at the  top  along\nwith cable-end-socket (detached cable) fell down  on  radiator  fin  due  to\nconstant arching sparking at nut bolt portion on bus bar,  decoiling  effect\nof cable and weight of cable. All coupled together led  to  eating  away  of\nmetal of cable and socket  resulting  in  U  shape  cable  socket  end.  The\nphysical examination of D.V.B. transformer reveals that the  cables  on  bus\nbars on L.T. Side did not have check nuts.  Except  one  lower  terminal  of\nphase Y and neutral terminal. The check nut of neutral  terminal  was  found\nin loose condition. The blue phase single cable at the top along with cable-\nend-socket (detached cable) fell  down  on  radiator  fin  due  to  constant\narching sparking at nut bolt portion on bus bar, decoling  effect  of  cable\nand weight of cable. All coupled together led to eating  away  of  metal  of\ncable and socket resulting in U shape cable socket end.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_334\">33.         In fact PW 48 S K Bahl (Addl. Chief Engineer DVB)  deposed  that\nas far as substation staff is concerned DVB has Asst. Electric Fitters/  Sr.\nElectric Fitter who actually carry out the maintenance  depending  upon  the\nextent of damage caused  to  such  equipment.   The  immediate  officer  for\ngetting such work done is the Junior Engineer who has specific  jurisdiction\nof the area as fixed by his officers. The Inspector/JE in  their  respective\nareas were responsible for 100% check of the substation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_335\">34.         It had come in the evidence that Crimping Machines are  provided\nfor the purpose of crimping the socket with LT  leads  of  the  transformer.\nThis is only to secure that no loose connections are made which  could  give\nrise to high temperature resulting   in  burning  of  leads  at  times.  One\ntransformer of 1000 KVA capacity was existing  in  one  of  the  transformer\nrooms at Uphaar complex which  was  catering  to  the  supply  of  adjoining\nlocalities of Green Park, apart from meeting part  of  the  load  of  Uphaar\ncomplex were some of the connections have been  allowed.  It  is  obligatory\nfor the staff of DVB to fllow the Indian Standards &amp;  DVB  Manual  for  both\ninstallation as well as maintenance of substation equipment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_336\">35.         PW 73 Y. P. Singh (Retd.)  Member  Technical  DVB  also  deposed\nthat his post was the highest post on technical side in  DVB.   He  went  to\nUphaar cinema  building  on  the  day  the  fire  incident  took  place  and\ninspected the place and he deposed that as per the sanction  order  crimping\nmachine was a major factor. Crimping machine is never kept  in  sub  station\nas a stock. It is issued to the person who has to carry on the  repairs.  It\nis incorrect that the effect of  hammer  &amp;  dye  is  the  same  as  that  of\ncrimping machine. In a crimping machine the worker is in a position  to  put\nrequired force while crimping the socket, while in case of dye &amp; hammer  the\nforce applied is always arbitrary.  A.K. Gera A-10 Gera has  contended  that\nhe was assigned  Zone 1603 and Uphaar  was  under  1601  therefore  he  just\naccompanied Satija and Bir Singh to  Uphaar  and  not  responsible  for  the\nrepair of the Transformer. In his deposition at PW40 has clarified that  the\ncomplaint was attended to by whoever was available at the time of  complaint\nand not limited to the persons assigned to that zone. Zones  are  demarcated\nfor maintenance but for breakdown there is no bifurcation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_337\">36.         PW44 Bhagwan Deen Mazdor DESU deposed that  on  13.6.97  he  was\nworking as Mazdoor in DESU at Sector 6 R.K. Puram DESU. On 13.6.97  and  had\naccompanied B. M. Satija, Inspector A.K. Gera &amp; Bir  Singh  Sr.  Fitter  and\nwent to Uphaar cinema at about 10-10.30 AM.  He had  taken  tool  box  along\nwith him under the instruction all  the  three  above  mentioned  officials.\n(The witness correctly identified all the accused in the court).  Bir  Singh\nopened the shutter of the transformer room where  the  DVB  transformer  was\ninstalled. The socket was changed with the help dye and hammer  as  crimping\nmachine was out of order by all the three mentioned above  i.e.  Bir  Singh,\nSatija &amp; A.K. Gera. After changing the  socket  the  lead  with  socket  was\nconnected Bus Bar. The entire repair work was  finished  within  45  minutes\napproximately. After replacing the socket and  connecting  to  Bus  Bar  the\nswitch was put on and thereafter electricity supply was restored.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_338\">37.         In addition to the aforesaid evidence,  A-15  H.S.  Panwar-Delhi\nFire Service was responsible for issuing NOC from the fire safety and  means\nof escape point of view. Though no fire  safety  and  means  of  escape  was\navailable as per the standard laid down, in the Uphaar Cinema  on  the  date\nof inspection i.e. 12.5.97 &amp; 15.5.97 still NOC was issued. On the  basis  of\nthis NOC, Temporary License was  issued  by  the  Licensing  Authority.  (Ex\n31/DB &amp; Ex 31/DC).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_339\">38.         As  a  consequence  of  the  aforesaid  findings  based  on  the\nanalysis of the evidence  recorded  hereinbefore,  sentence  of   two  years\nawarded by the trial court in my view was not fit to be interfered  with  by\nthe High Court and for this reason the appeal preferred by the  AVUT is  fit\nto be allowed to the extent that although  the charge under  Section  304  A\nmay not be allowed to be converted into 304 Part II by remanding the  matter\nfor re-trial  after the passage of  more than 16  years,  yet  the  sentence\nmay not be reduced which trivializes or minimises the gravity of offence  to\na farce  whereby justice to the cause  appears to be a mirage, mockery or  a\nmere tokenism.  In my considered opinion, the High Court   has  indulged  in\nmisplaced sympathy  by reducing  the sentence of two years  awarded  by  the\nTrial Court to one year in spite of its  finding  upholding  the  charge  of\ngross criminal negligence under  Section  304A  and  other  allied  Sections\nwhich is grossly inadequate considering the nature  and gravity  of  offence\ncommitted by the appellants as  also  the  finding  that  I  have   recorded\nhereinabove due to which their  conviction  under Section 304  A,  337,  338\nread with 36 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_269\">IPC</a> has been upheld by us.  In  our  opinion,   the  extent  of\nthe sentence of two years was thus not fit to be  interfered with.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_340\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"941248\" id=\"span_66\">39.         Nevertheless, the fact remains that 16  years  have  elapsed  in\nthe process of conclusion of the trial and pendency of the appeal   and  the\nappellant No.1 Sushil Ansal is now aged more than 74 years and even if   the\nappellants are subjected to undergo the maximum sentence  of two  years,  it\ncan hardly be held to be sufficient so as to match with  the  magnitude  and\ngravity of offence for giving rise to the catastrophe  in which  59  persons\nlost  their lives  due to reckless and gross criminal act of  negligence  at\nthe instance  of  the appellants.  Therefore, in an offence of  this  nature\nwhich can be put some what  on  par  with  the  well-known  tragic  incident\ncommonly known as ‘Bhopal Gas Leak Tragedy’, compensation  of  high  quantum\nalong with sentence  of imprisonment  may meet the  ends  of  justice  which\nmust be punitive, deterrent and exemplary   in  nature.   However,  in  this\ncontext, I also find force in the view taken by the High Court of Bombay  in\nthe matter of <a href=\"/doc/941248/\" id=\"a_270\">State of Maharashtra vs. Chandra  Prakash  Neshavdev</a>  reported\nin 1991 Cr.L.J. 3187, wherein it observed that it is an essential  necessity\nof public policy that accused who have committed  crimes  must  be  punished\nwhen facts are fresh in the public  mind.   If  for  whatever  reasons,  the\njudicial process had dragged on for  an  abnormal  point  of  time  and  the\naccused at that stage is faced with an adverse verdict, it would not  be  in\nthe interest of justice to impose at this point of  time  jail  sentence  on\nthe accused however serious the  facts  of  the  case  are.   Moreover,  the\ntragic  incident  in  this  matter  was  the  consequence  of  a  cumulative\nnegligence at the instance of the licensee Sushil Ansal  and  its  executing\nauthority Gopal Ansal as also due to the fault in  the  transformer  of  the\nDelhi Vidyut Board (DVB) and negligence of their  employees  which  was  not\nrepaired and maintained properly as discussed hereinbefore and  the  accused\nappellants did not make a cautious  and  realistic  attempt  or  used  their\nforesight to  foresee  such  an  incident  as  ultimately  the  aim  of  the\nappellants Sushil Ansal and Gopal Ansal in Criminal Appeal Nos.597  and  598\nof 2010 was to make monetary gain by running the theatre.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_341\">40.         Hence, I am of the view that the interest  of  justice  to  some\nextent would be served by imposing on the accused appellants  a  substantial\nfine and not merely a jail sentence.  Thus, while the sentence of  one  year\nimposed by the High Court is upheld, the additional  sentence  of  one  year\nfurther while allowing the appeal of AVUT, is fit to  be  substituted  by  a\nsubstantial sum of fine to be shared equally by the appellants Sushil  Ansal\nand Gopal Ansal alongwith the DVB which  also  cannot  absolve  itself  from\ncompensating the victims of Uphaar tragedy represented by the AVUT.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_342\">41.         Thus, while  I  uphold  the  conviction  and   sentence  of  the\nappellant No.2 Gopal Ansal in Criminal Appeal No.598 of 2010  who   was   in\nfact conducting the business of running the Uphaar Theatre and  had  greater\ndegree of responsibility  to ensure  safety  of  the   cinema  viewers,  the\nappellant Sushil Ansal in Criminal Appeal No.597 of  2010  was  primarily  a\nlicensee  who  was  conducting  the  business  and  running  Uphaar  Theatre\nessentially through his brother A-2 Gopal Ansal.  Hence, while the  sentence\nof one year  awarded in Criminal Appeal No.597 of 2010 to  Sushil  Ansal  is\nfit to be upheld, the sentence already undergone by him may  be  treated  as\nsufficient in the said appeal as he has already served  major  part  of  the\nsentence and in spite of dismissal of his appeal,  he  would   at  the  most\nserve  the balance three months sentence further along with remission.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_343\">42.         But while allowing the appeal of AVUT and CBI, I  take  note  of\nthe fact that since Sushil Ansal is now more  than  74  years  old  and  was\nrunning the theatre business essentially along with  his  brother  appellant\nNo.2 Gopal Ansal, I consider that the period  of enhanced sentence in  these\nappeals imposed  on the appellants Sushil  Ansal  and  Gopal  Ansal  may  be\nsubstituted  with substantial amount of fine  to  be  specified  hereinafter\nand paid in the appeal bearing Nos.600-602 of 2010  preferred  by  AVUT  and\nCriminal Appeal Nos.605-616 of 2010 preferred by  the  CBI  which  shall  be\nshared by the appellant Sushil Ansal and  appellant  Gopal  Ansal  in  equal\nmeasure along  with the Delhi Vidyut Board as I  have  upheld  the  sentence\nimposed on their employees too.  My  view  stands  fortified  by  the  order\npassed in the case of Bhopal Gas  Leak  Tragedy  where  the  punishment  for\ncriminal  negligence   was  allowed  to  be   substituted   by   substantial\ncompensation which were paid to the victims or their legal representatives.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_344\">43.         In view  of  the  candid,  comprehensive,  unblemished  findings\nrecorded by the trial court, High Court  and upheld by  us  after  intensive\nand threadbear scrutiny of the evidence led  by  the   prosecution  as  also\nthe  accused  respondents  in  the  Criminal  Appeal  Nos.600-602  of   2010\npreferred by the AVUT and Criminal Appeal Nos.605-616 of 2010  preferred  by\nthe CBI, I am of  the view  that the appeals preferred by the AVUT  and  CBI\nare fit to be allowed and no leniency deserves to be shown  while   awarding\nmaximum sentence prescribed  under Section 304 A and other allied  sections.\n Nonetheless one will also have to be pragmatic and cannot ignore  that  the\nenhancement  of sentence of one year to two  years  to  the  accused  cannot\nbring  back those who suffered and lost their lives in the  tragic  and  the\nhorrific  incident.   Thus,  while  I  am  fully  conscious  and  share  the\nintensity of the agony and deep concern of  the AVUT   which has  diligently\n prosecuted  the  appeal up to the highest Court, I am  of  the   view  that\nthe ends of justice to some extent would  be  met  by  not  merely  awarding\nthem sentence  of imprisonment  which  I  do  by  dismissing  their  appeals\nagainst the judgment and order of the High Court  by which  a  sentence   of\none year has been awarded to  all the accused, but also by  enhancing  their\nsentence but substituting it with substantial amount of fine to be used  for\nthe public cause in the memory of the Uphaar victims.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_345\">43.         Hence, in so far as  the  Criminal  Appeal  No.600-602  of  2010\npreferred by the AVUT/Victims Association and  the  prosecution  represented\nby CBI bearing Criminal Appeal Nos.605-616 of 2010 are concerned, I deem  it\njust and appropriate to allow both the appeals by enhancing  their  sentence\nupto the maximum period of two years prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_271\">IPC</a> for offence  under\nSection 304A but in lieu of the additional period of sentence of  one  year,\na substantial  amount  of fine to be specified hereinafter  is  directed  to\nbe paid by the appellants Sushil Ansal, Gopal  Ansal  and  DVB  in  view  of\ngross negligence on the part of their employees in order to compensate   the\ncharge of criminal negligence established against  these   accused  persons.\nHence, the  enhanced  period of sentence  of  one year shall be  substituted\nby imposition of the amount of fine to be paid  by  them  and  I  do  so  by\nplacing reliance on the ratio of  the order passed in the  well  known  case\nof Bhopal Gas Leak Tragedy wherein the entire criminal case itself had  been\nquashed by way of settlement  against  the  accused  and  the  sentence  was\nsubstituted with heavy amount of  fine which was paid to the victims by  way\nof compensation.  However, in  this  matter,  the  appellants  have  already\nstood the test of a long drawn trial wherein they have  been  convicted  and\nsentenced which I have  upheld  and  hence  they  shall  undergo   remaining\nperiod of sentence imposed under Section 304A along with the fine  which  we\npropose to impose in the appeals preferred by AVUT and CBI.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_346\">44.         Therefore, for the reasons recorded hereinbefore, I  am  of  the\nview  that  in lieu of  the enhanced sentence   of  a  period  of  one  year\nwhich I allow in the  appeals  preferred  by  AVUT  and  CBI,  the  same  be\nsubstituted with a fine of Rs.100 crores (One Hundred Crores) to  be  shared\nand paid by A-1 Sushil Ansal and A-2 Gopal Ansal in equal  measure  i.e.  50\ncrores each and 100 crores in all and shall be  paid  by  way  of  a  demand\ndraft issued in the name of the Secretary General of the  Supreme  Court  of\nIndia which shall be kept  in a fixed deposit in any nationalised  Bank  and\nshall be spent  on the construction of a Trauma Centre to be built   in  the\nmemory of Uphaar Victims  at any suitable place at Dwarka in  New  Delhi  as\nwe are informed that Dwarka is an accident prone area  but   does  not  have\nany governmental infrastructure  or  public  health  care  centre  to  treat\naccident victims.  For  this purpose,  the  State  of  Delhi  as  DVB  which\nis/was an instrumentality of the State, shall allot at least five  acres  of\nland or more at any suitable location at Dwarka  within  a  period  of  four\nmonths of this judgment and order on which a trauma  centre    for  accident\nvictims alongwith a super speciality department/  ward   for  burn  injuries\nshall be constructed to be known as the ‘Victims of Uphaar  Memorial  Trauma\nCentre’  or any other name  that   may  be   suggested  by  the  AVUT/Uphaar\nVictims  Association.   This  trauma  centre  shall  be  treated     as   an\nextension  centre  of the Safdarjung  Hospital, New Delhi which is close  to\nUphaar Theatre and was the accident site which is hard  pressed   for  space\nand desperately needs expansion considering the enormous number of  patients\nwho go there for treatment.
