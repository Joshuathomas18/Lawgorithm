In this\n\n                 Court there is long queue of criminal appeals for their final\n\n                 hearing.   The appellants naturally would insist upon and\n\n                 push forward their plea for suspension of their sentence\n\n                 and consequent release on bail, pending appeal.         At the\n\n                 time of admission of an appeal or upon receipt of the\n\n                 lower Court&#x27;s record, this Court, based on merits of\n\n                 evidence, in exercise of power under Section 389 of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> Patna High Court CR. APP (SJ) No.167 of 2015 (6) dt.30-01-2017</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                          2/24</span>\n\n\n\n\n               <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> (hereinafter referred to as\n\n               the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_2\">Cr.P.C</a>.), may or may not allow the prayer for\n\n               suspension of sentence. There cannot be any difficulty up\n\n               to that stage.           Difficulties arise thereafter when upon\n\n               rejection of claim for suspension of sentence, it becomes\n\n               uncertain as to how much time will it take for final hearing\n\n               and adjudication upon the appeal. Repeated attempts are\n\n               made thereafter by filing successive applications for\n\n               suspension of sentence and release on bail. Review of an\n\n               order refusing bail, pending appeal, is impermissible\n\n               under law. Should the Court, in such circumstance, based\n\n               on period of custody already undergone by an appellant\n\n               and chance of appeal of being taken up in near future\n\n               remaining uncertain; reconsider the prayer for bail, is a\n\n               question which has come forth.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">                                   2. The present case is an example, which\n\n               has been placed under the heading &quot;For Orders&quot; on a 3rd\n\n               attempt made by the appellant for suspension of sentence\n\n               and     his    release      on    bail,    by     filing   an   interlocutory\n\n               application, bearing I.A. No. 2363 of 2016. The appellant\n\n               stands convicted of an offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1279834/\" id=\"a_3\">Section\n\n               376</a> of the Indian Penal Code (hereinafter referred to\n\n               as the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_4\">IPC</a>) and has been sentenced to undergo rigorous\n\n               imprisonment for a period of 10 years with a fine of Rs.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\"> Patna High Court CR.

In default of payment of fine, he has been\n\n               made to undergo rigorous imprisonment for a further\n\n               period of 2 years.             He has also been convicted of the\n\n               offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/140515/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 313</a> of the IPC for which\n\n               he has been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment\n\n               for a period of 5 years with a fine of Rs. 10,000/- and in\n\n               default of payment of fine, he has been made to undergo\n\n               rigorous imprisonment for a period of 1 year.                      Both the\n\n               sentences are to run concurrently.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_3\">                                   3.

The      appellant       filed   this   appeal   on\n\n               07.04.2015. By an order, dated 30.04.2015, the appeal\n\n               was directed to be admitted, lower Court&#x27;s record of the\n\n               concerned sessions trial was called for with an observation\n\n               that prayer for bail shall be considered on receipt of the\n\n               lower Court&#x27;s record.             After receipt of the lower Court&#x27;s\n\n               record, the appellant pressed his prayer for suspension of\n\n               sentence and his release on bail and took a plea that\n\n               there has been unexplained delay in lodging of the\n\n               complaint petition.            By an order, dated 25.06.2015, his\n\n               prayer for bail was, however, rejected with an observation\n\n               that if the appeal was not to be heard within 9 months,\n\n               the appellant may renew his prayer for bail.

Considering, however, the\n\n               nature of allegation, his prayer was again rejected by an\n\n               order, dated 27.04.2016, with an observation that hearing\n\n               of the appeal be expedited.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">                                   4.

I will begin, therefore, first with the\n\n               concern expressed by the Supreme Court over delay in\n\n               disposal of criminal appeals and the practice not to\n\n               release on bail, a person, who has been convicted and\n\n               sentenced          to     imprisonment            <a href=\"/doc/193152/\" id=\"a_10\">(<a href=\"/doc/193152/\" id=\"a_11\">in   that    case</a></a>   life\n\n               imprisonment).</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"193152\" id=\"span_14\">In case of <a href=\"/doc/193152/\" id=\"a_12\">Kashmira Singh</a> (supra), the\n\n               Supreme Court noticed long prevailing practice adopted\n\n               by the Supreme Court and many High Courts not to\n\n               release a person on bail, after having been sentenced to\n\n               life imprisonment for an offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">Section\n\n               302</a> of the IPC. The Supreme Court in said case posed a\n\n               question to itself as to whether the practice should be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> Patna High Court CR.

Every practice of the Court\n\n               must find its ultimate justification in the interest of\n\n               justice, the Supreme Court held.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">                                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"193152\" id=\"span_17\">8. The Supreme Court, in case of <a href=\"/doc/193152/\" id=\"a_14\">Kashmira\n\n               Singh</a> (supra), further remarked that practice not to\n\n               release on bail a person, who was sentenced to life\n\n               imprisonment, was evolved in the High Courts on the\n\n               basis that once a person had been found guilty and\n\n               sentenced to life imprisonment, he should not be let\n\n               loose, so long as his conviction and sentence are not set\n\n               aside, but at the same time noticed the underlying\n\n               postulate of this practice that the appeal of such person\n\n               would be disposed of within a &quot;measurable distance of\n\n               time&quot;, so that if he is ultimately found to be innocent, he\n\n               would not have to remain in jail for an unduly ling period.</span>\n\n               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"193152\" id=\"span_18\">The Court, in case of <a href=\"/doc/193152/\" id=\"a_15\">Kashmira Singh</a> (supra), made\n\n               significant observations by answering to the questions\n\n               posed by itself in paragraph 2 of the decision, relevant\n\n               portion of which reads thus:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                                                           &quot;2. x x x x x x x.

There cannot be any straightjacket\n                     formula       and     hard        and   fast    rule      of   universal\n                     application for consideration of bail in such situation.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">                     The discretion always lies with the Court to allow or\n                     reject any plea for grant of bail during the pendency\n                     of appeal, in the background of nature of the case\n                     and other attending circumstances.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">                                         (ii) Ordinarily, if the appellant has\n                     spent half of the term of sentence in custody, in\n                     connection with a case, before conviction and after\n                     conviction taken together and his appeal is not likely\n                     to be heard on merits in near future, he should be\n                     released on bail on the ground of possible delay in\n                     disposal of the appeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">                                         (iii) In any event, if the appellant has\n                     remained in custody for two (2) years or more after\n                     conviction and awaiting for turn of his appeal to\n                     come for final hearing and there is no likelihood of\n                     the appeal being taken up in near future, his case for\n                     release on bail would need favourable consideration\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\"> Patna High Court CR.

Now, coming to the facts of the present\n\n               case, the appellant stood convicted on 03.03.2015 and\n\n               order of sentence was passed on 04.03.2015. Since then\n\n               he is in custody. The maximum sentence is for a term of\n\n               10 years. He is yet to complete 2 years from the date of\n\n               conviction and sentence. Additionally, there is nothing to\n\n               show that the appellant took effective steps for expediting\n\n               hearing of his appeal.              However, I find from the order-\n\n               sheet that despite order of this Court to expedite the\n\n               hearing of the appeal, the hearing could not be expedited.\n\n               In such circumstance, though I am not inclined to suspend\n\n               the sentence in the present case, but I observe that the\n\n               appellant shall be at liberty to apply for suspension of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">        Patna High Court CR.
