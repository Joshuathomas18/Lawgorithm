The\n\n         faulty repair to the transformer resulted in                         a loose\n\n         connection that led to the catching of fire to the\n\n         transformer and all the cars in the parking lot were\n\n         burnt in the fire which resulted in suffocation for\n\n         viewers of the cinema in the hall.
