A fact cannot be lost sight  of  that  the  said  movable\n           property was standing in the name of A-8.  Even accepting that A-\n           8 was then at Dubai, still the possession of the said  van  will\n           be required to be with her.  In view of the same,  if  the  said\n           van was used for such nefarious activities then the  same  would\n           lead to a logical conclusion of such a user could not have  been\n           made without her permission of her connivance.  Since A-8 having\n           not tried to give any explanation for explaining the said  facet\n           clearly reveals that she cannot escape  the  liability  accruing\n           due to van standing in her name being used for such a  nefarious\n           activity.”\n\nWe are in agreement with the said conclusion.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">Recoveries from Al-Hussaini building after the blasts\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">16)   The abandoned Maruti car bearing number MFC 1972 which  was  recovered\nfrom outside the gate of Siemens factory at  Worli  on  12.03.1993  led  the\npolice to the flat of Rubina Suleman Memon  (A-8)  at  Al-Hussaini  building\nsince the car belonged to her.

The evidence on record establishes that the  A-8\nwas aware that the vehicle owned by her (i.e. MFC 1972) was being  used  for\nterrorist acts by Tiger Memon and his associates. It is further  established\nthat Flat Nos. 22, 25 and 26 at Al-Hussaini building, where members  of  the\nMemons’ family resided jointly, were the nucleus of the criminal  conspiracy\nas they were the locations where  Tiger  Memon  and  Yakub  Memon  met  with\nseveral other co-accused  persons  during  the  period  of  the  conspiracy.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">Further, the arms and explosives smuggled into India for the purpose of  the\nconspiracy were also kept at the said building and lastly RDX was filled  in\nthe vehicles in and outside the garages allocated  to  the  Memons’  at  Al-\nHussaini building which were used/planted as  bombs  at  various  places  on\n12.03.1993 by all the conspirators.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">32)   Further, it is pertinent to note here  that  the  evidence  on  record\nreveals that the Maruti car used by A-3 was:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">(a)   driven by several co-accused persons including A-15, A-46 and A-11  to\nthe landing point  at  Shekhadi  from  Bombay  for  landing  of  weapons  in\nFebruary, 1993;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">(b)   loaded with RDX on the night of 11.03.1993  at  Al-Hussaini  Building;\nand\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">(c)   parked on 12.03.1993 at the Lucky Petrol Pump by A-16  and  PW-2  near\nShiv Sena Bhawan which exploded killing 4 persons and injuring 38 others.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_46\">The above mentioned evidence establishes that the white car  driven  by  A-3\nwas used for terrorist  activities  by  Tiger  Memon  and  other  co-accused\npersons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_47\">33)   Further, A-3, A-4, and A-8 resided jointly at these flats where  Tiger\nMemon,  Yakub  Memon  (A-1)  and  their  associates  hatched  the   criminal\nconspiracy to carry out multiple explosions in Bombay. The  conduct  of  the\nappellants in not reporting any of these activities to the  police  and  the\nfact that A-3 and A-4 departed from India on  11.03.1993  in  itself  is  an\nincriminating circumstance to be used against the appellants.  None  of  the\nappellants responded to the proclamation requiring presence  issued  by  the\nDesignated Court, which was given wide publicity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_48\">34)   The evidence on record establishes  that  the  appellants  facilitated\nthe commission of terrorist acts as defined  in  <a href=\"/doc/74809654/\" id=\"a_38\">Section  3(1)</a>  of  TADA  by\nconniving with Tiger Memon and his associates and  permitting  them  to  use\ntheir flats and vehicles  for  the  purposes  of  criminal  conspiracy.  The\nactions of the appellants squarely fall within <a href=\"/doc/105771932/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 3(3)</a> of TADA  insofar\nas the appellants have facilitated and  abetted  the  conduct  of  terrorist\nacts by Tiger Memon and his associates.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_49\">35)   After the blasts that took place in Bombay on 12.03.1993, the  Memons’\nwere living together in Dubai.   They  never  disclosed  the  connection  of\nTiger with the blasts to anyone. Their  conduct  of  living  together  after\nfleeing from Bombay and not informing about  these  blasts  to  any  of  the\nconcerned authorities at Indian Embassy  establishes  that  they  were  also\ninvolved in the conspiracy to commit the bomb blasts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_50\">36)   After the blasts, the Memons’ fled to Pakistan from  Dubai  and  there\nis evidence that in Pakistan  they  had  obtained  Pakistani  Passports  and\nNational Identity Cards in assumed  names.  The  Memons’  and  their  family\nmembers were leading a comfortable and  luxurious  life  after  the  blasts.\nThey had acquired properties, started business in the name and style of  M/s\nHome Land Builders, acquired fictitious qualification certificates,  driving\nlicences, etc, all of which established that they had chosen  a  comfortable\nlife in Pakistan and were  determined  not  to  return  to  India  in  their\noriginal identity. The above-said facts clearly establish that  the  members\nof Memons’ family were connected with the Bombay Bomb Blasts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">37)   All the members of Memons’ family were declared  Proclaimed  Offenders\nby the Designated Court, Bombay. The rewards were also  declared  in  Indian\nas well as in foreign currency for their arrest.   Despite  that,  they  did\nnot surrender.  Instead, the Memons’  travelled  to  Bangkok  and  Singapore\nfrom Karachi for holiday in assumed  names  on  Pakistani  Passports  during\nApril, 1993. They have not  taken  any  steps  to  surrender  before  Indian\nAuthorities  or  Thailand  Authorities  on  their  arrival  to  Bangkok  and\nSingapore after having come to know about the  blasts  engineered  by  Tiger\nMemon nor made any attempt to return to India openly if they had  felt  that\nbomb  blasts  are  offences  committed  in  India.  This   conduct   clearly\nestablishes that they were aware of  the  blasts  that  were  engineered  by\nTiger Memon who was living with them right from the time  of  blasts,  i.e.,\n12th March 1993, in Dubai, Pakistan and other places.  Their  documents  for\ntravel to Bangkok and Singapore from Karachi show that they  have  travelled\non Pakistani Passports using fake  names.   This  conduct  also  establishes\ntheir culpability.  It is also in evidence that  huge  amount  of  jewellery\nand cash which was abandoned by the members of Memon’s family was  recovered\nfrom the Al-Hussaini building when they hurriedly left  Bombay  just  before\nthe blasts.   This is also a proof that all the Memons’ were fully aware  of\nthe blasts and their conduct in fleeing away very clearly  establishes  that\nthey were aware of the blasts  and  association  of  Tiger  Memon  with  the\nblasts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_52\">38)   In view of the materials placed on record by the prosecution  and  the\nultimate  analysis  of  the  Designated  Court,  we  fully  agree  with  the\nconviction and sentence  imposed  upon  the  appellants,  consequently,  the\nappeals filed by the appellants are liable to be dismissed.</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n           Criminal Appeal Nos. 1127-1128 of 2007\n\n\nSardar Shahwali Khan (A-54)             …..

Learned counsel  for  the  appellant\nsubmitted that in the absence of signature of the appellant on  either  side\nof the memorandum or discovery panchnama, the entire memorandum  has  to  be\nignored.  However, learned counsel appearing for the CBI,  by  pointing  out\nthe signature in the said document, claimed that such signature was that  of\nthe appellant. Even if we accept that the appellant-accused has  not  signed\nthe panchnama, in view of the contents therein and the  statement  of  panch\nwitness (though he turned hostile at a later point of time),  it  cannot  be\nrejected as claimed by the counsel for the appellant.  Further, one  of  the\npanchas i.e.,  PW-85  though  turned  hostile,  the  fact  remains  that  he\naccepted his signature.  He also admitted  the  contents  and  informed  the\nCourt that the  same  was  explained  to  him.   Admittedly,  this  was  not\nchallenged by  the  appellant  (A-71)  while  cross  examining  him.

The  said  lavatory  was  having  a\nbroken door which was open.   A-71  pointed  out  3  bags  kept  inside  the\nlavatory which were kept on the floor of the same.  All the three bags  were\nof Encore Company and were almost of the same size.  The keys  of  the  said\nbags were also lying at the  said  place.   The  said  keys  were  in  three\nseparate bunches.  A-71 took up one bunch of keys  and  opened  one  of  the\nbags out of the three.  The said bag was found  to  be  containing  85  hand\ngrenades.  By way of sample, one of the hand grenade from the said  bag  was\ntaken by PI Sawant.

For\nsample, one detonator from each bundle was taken by PI Sawant.   Thereafter,\nA-71 opened the third bag with the help of keys.  The said bag was found  to\nbe containing 3270 cartridges of AK-56 rifles.   The  said  cartridges  were\nbearing three different types of markings.

It  needs  no  saying  that  the\n      weapon of such a nature cannot be acquired  and/or  possessed  without\n      incurring any appreciable expenditure.

It is also relevant to point out that the  prosecution  failed  to\nlead acceptable evidence to show that such recovered contrabands  were  used\nin any crime by the appellant and even the  Designated  Court  came  to  the\nsame finding.

It is also pointed out that the appellant has  already  undergone  a\nperiod of 8 ½ years (approximately) without remission.

After a gap of more than  two  years,  it  is\nplausible that memory could have faded and accordingly  the  witness  failed\nto identify  him  before  the  court.  However,  during  the  identification\nparades, which were conducted soon after the incident, PW-25 identified  the\nappellant to be the person who quarreled with him and parked the scooter  at\nDiamond House.

Chhatwal (PW-684),  the  then  S.P.,  CBI-STF,  New  Delhi.  A-136  was\nworking as  a  driver  for  Mohd.  Dossa  (AA).   A  brief  summary  of  his\nconfession with regard to A-112 is reproduced hereunder:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_360\">(i)   About 6-8 months prior to the  blasts,  a  meeting  was  held  between\n      Mohd.

Dossa has been  held  against  him  by  the  trial\ncourt, however, merely meeting with a smuggler is not sufficient  since  his\njob was to control smuggling and Customs Officers often mix  with  smugglers\nto make seizures or increase the number of  their  informants.  It  is  also\ncontended that there is no direct evidence that A-112 aided  Mohd.  Dosa  or\nother smugglers. It is further  contended  by  Mr.  Jaspal  Singh  that  the\nconfession of A-136 makes it clear that meeting of  A-112  with  Mohd.  Dosa\ntook place before the conspiracy started.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_183\">99)   In an answer, the counsel for the  CBI  submitted  that  although  ex-\nfacie it appears that the case against A-112 is of dereliction of  duty  and\nnegligence, a closer scrutiny of the entire evidence on  record  would  show\nthat the appellant had a connection and understanding with the smugglers  in\norder to facilitate a safe passage to them.  It is  further  submitted  that\nat the same time A-112 has created the record  to  show  that  he  has  done\npossibly everything in his official capacity to  prevent  the  smuggling  of\narms and ammunitions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_184\">100)  It has been established through the confession  of  A-136  that  there\nwas a meeting between A-136, Mohd. Dossa  and  Dawood  Ibrahim,  where  they\nagreed to take revenge for the atrocities committed against the  Muslims.  A\nsimilar meeting of Tiger Memon with Dawood Ibrahim and A-14  has  also  been\nproved through  the  confession  of  A-14.  The  confession  of  A-136  also\nestablishes that arms and ammunitions were sent by  Mustafa  Dosa,  who  was\nthe brother of Mohd. Dosa, for which A-134 was instructed by Mohd.  Dosa  to\nmake arrangements.  Apart from the confession of A-136 which  indicates  the\nlink between Mohd.

The fact that  ambush  could\nhave been set up at a better location (i.e.,  at  the  intersection  of  two\nroads going to Bombay) with benefit of hindsight cannot be held  against  A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_211\">112.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_212\">107)  It is further  contended  that  no  evidence  establishes  that  A-112\ndeliberately set up the ambush at one road so  as  to  permit  the  vehicles\ncarrying arms to take the other road to Bombay.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_213\">108)  The  above  submissions  are  unacceptable.   The  evidence  of  PW-99\nestablishes that the setting up of the ambush at the place of choice  of  A-\n112 was done deliberately by him. A-112 told his subordinates  that  he  has\nspecific information about the particular route and time of  landing.  A-112\nalso told them about Tiger Memon.  A-112  further  told  them  that  he  has\nspecific information that they will go through  Purar  Phata.  A-112  called\noff the vigil at midnight and does not organize the same  after  31st.   Ex-\nfacie it appears that it could  have  been  an  error  of  judgment  of  the\nofficer. None of the information on  record  shows  the  smuggling  of  arms\nwould be conducted by Tiger Memon;  the  said  goods  would  be  transported\nthrough Purar Phata; and it would be done only on 30th and 31st night.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_214\">109)  From the topography of the area, it is also clear that  the  vigil  at\nPurar Phata  was  kept  deliberately  to  provide  a  safe  passage  to  the\nsmugglers:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_380\">           [pic]\nAs rightly pointed out by the prosecution, from  the  aforesaid  topography,\nit is clear that the  ambush  could  have  been  kept  at  the  junction  as\nsuggested by PW-99 which could have covered both the routes to  Bombay.  The\nmaterials clearly show that A-112 knowingly  directed  Nakabandi  at  ‘Purar\nPhata’ and “Behar Phata’ which  left  Sai-Morba  Road  route  open  for  the\nsmugglers to travel safely.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_381\">110)  It is also brought to our notice that A-112 also spread  rumour  of  a\nspecific information when there was none. It is also not  clear  as  to  why\nthe vigil was called off at midnight when as a matter of practice  smuggling\ntakes place after midnight. It is also not  clear  why  no  vigil  was  kept\nafter 31st night of January, 1993. All the aforesaid was  justified  on  the\nbasis of non-existence of specific information.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_382\">111)  The above said conduct of A-112 has to be considered in the  light  of\nthe fact that A-112 was  duly  informed  by  his  superior  that  they  have\nintelligence that ISI may send weapons along with silver or gold.  The  said\ninformation requested the Officer to be alert. It is also to  be  seen  that\nthe information of the above said landing was  the  first  such  information\nafter the alert notice of 25.01.1993. The said information, amongst  others,\nhas been proved by PW-470.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_383\">Deposition of SR Bharadwaj (PW-470)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_384\">112)  PW-470 was working as Collector of  Customs  (Preventive)  at  Bombay.\nFrom his testimony, the following facts emerge:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_385\">(i)   He was the senior officer and A-112 was working under him.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_386\">(ii)  On 24/25.01.1993, he received  information  from  DRI  that  some  ISI\n      syndicate located in Middle-East may try to smuggle  contraband  items\n      into India. He told A-112 and A-102 about this information.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_387\">(iii) A-112 told him in the end of January that  there  was  no  landing  of\n      contraband since either the information was leaked or the movement  of\n      customs officials was known.  PW-470  told  A-112  to  ask  the  local\n      officers to keep the track of the said information.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_215\">A perusal of deposition of PW-470 establishes that he  asked  A-112  to  ask\nlocal officers to keep track of the said  information  and  further  he  had\nissued a letter being Exhibit No. 1536  informing  Mr.  R.K.  Singh  (A-102)\nabout landing of large quantity of automatic weapons  in  next  15-30  days.\nThis letter was copied to A-112 also.  The evidence  of  PW-470  has  to  be\nconsidered in the light of the conduct of A-112, emerging from the  evidence\nof PW-98 and PW-99.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_216\">Deposition of Bhaskar Krishanji Naik (PW-168)\n       PW-168  was  working  as  a  Superintendent,  Customs   (Marine   and\nPreventive) Wing since 28.12.1992, in Central Intelligence Unit (C.I.U.)  at\nEverest House, Bombay. He identified in the Court the entry  in  the  Inward\nRegister marked as X-181 pertaining to the confidential  letter  written  by\nPW-470 to R.K. Singh and which was also  forwarded  to  A-112  stating  that\nlarge quantity of automatic weapons along with contraband  items  like  gold\nand silver were likely to land around Bombay in the  next  15-20  days,  and\ntherefore, necessary action should be taken.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_217\">113)  The deposition of this witness proves that  A-112  had  been  informed\nwell in advance that landing of arms was going to take place  and  it  could\nhappen anytime within 15-20 days from  the  time  the  letter  was  written,\ni.e., 25.01.1993.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_218\">114)  Inspite of clear information that large quantity of automatic  weapons\nwill land in next 15 days, A-112 only kept ambush for 2 days  and  that  too\nat wrong places and also spread a rumour that  the  place  was  appropriate,\nsince he has a specific information.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_219\">Deposition of Vishwambhal M.

From his testimony, the following facts emerge:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_388\">(i)   He knew A-112 as he was also working under  the  Collector  of  Custom\n      (Preventive), Shri S.K. Bharadwaj (PW-470).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_389\">(ii)  The word ‘Panther’ is used to denote ‘Additional Collector’.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_390\">(iii) On the night of 01.02.1993, he received a call at about  2  a.m.  from\n      his sources informing him that landing of contraband was taking  place\n      at Mhasla. PW-171 immediately told the same to A-112.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_391\">(iv)  A-112, thereafter,  gave  an  alert  message  to  Mhasla,  Bankot  and\n      Alibaug divisions.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_221\">It is pointed out by the  prosecution  that  deposition  of  PW-171  clearly\nestablishes that A-112 alerted the customs officials at Bankot  and  Alibaug\nalso whereas the information received was for landing at Mhasla only.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_222\">116)  It is argued on the side of the CBI that  the  paper  work  of  giving\nalert was done by A-112  since  the  message  was  given  by  an  Additional\nCollector and something was to be shown to have been done. Exhibit 2594 - X-\n711 is the VHF Radio logbook. The  relevant  extract  of  message  reads  as\nunder:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_392\">      &quot;Something has happened at Bankot therefore maximum alert to  be  kept\n      at D-31 division starting immediately&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_223\">It shows that A-112 had asked to keep a strict vigil at Bankot in  the  face\nof clear and specific information that the landing  was  to  take  place  at\nMhasla. The said specific information was distorted  as  well  as  converted\ninto a vague message that something is happening  in  the  Alibaug  division\nwhich is a very big division. In view of the specific information  given  by\na  senior  officer,  the  message  circulated  by  A-112  about  Bankot  was\ncompletely misleading since Bankot is about 45 kms. from Mhasla.\nDeposition of Liladhar Dattaray Mhatre (PW-172)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_224\">117)  PW-172 was an Officer in Central Excise Department  in  Bombay.   From\nhis testimony, the following facts emerge:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_393\">(i)   He received information on 29.01.1993 from his  sources  that  landing\n      of silver was to take place at Shekhadi on 29/31.01.1993.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_394\">(ii)  He immediately told A-112 about this information.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_395\">(iii) PW-172 received information after about 7-8 days (around  5th  or  6th\nFebruary) that instead of silver, landing of some chemical had  taken  place\non 03.02.1993 at Shekhadi. He told A-112 about this  information  and  A-112\nsaid ‘kya ho sakta hai’?  (what can be done) and in cross PW-172 says  ‘Acha\nthik hai, main dekhta huin kya hoga’  (let me see what can be done).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_396\">118) The conduct of A-112 has to be considered in the light  of  the  letter\ndated 25.01.1993 proved by PW-470.  It  may  also  be  considered  that  the\nsecond landing could have been obstructed, if immediate action on  the  said\nletter was taken. Even  the  said  arms  and  ammunitions  which  landed  on\n03.02.1993 could have been traced, if the said information was  shared  with\nthe Customs Department as  well  as  the  Police.  The  appellant  not  only\navoided alerting the Department, but also did not share the  said  piece  of\ninformation till 25.03.1993 with the Department.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_225\">119)  It has been contended by learned senior counsel for A-112 that he  was\nsurprised to hear about the landing of chemicals instead of silver and  thus\nit can be inferred that A-112 was  not  aware  of  the  landing  of  RDX  at\nShekhadi.  As per the letter issued by PW-470, the information was  specific\nthat automatic weapons were to land in next 15-20 days near Bombay.  Inspite\nof this clear information, A-112 only kept ambush for two days and told  the\nofficers on duty that  he  will  issue  directions,  if  further  ambush  is\nrequired. We are also satisfied that  A-112  deliberately  did  not  keep  a\nvigil at the required place and even after the information the chemical  had\nlanded and he did not take any steps to  further  pass  on  the  information\nuntil 25.03.1993. It may also be  seen  in  the  light  of  his  conduct  of\ndiverting attention of the Department from Mhasla to  Bankot  despite  there\nbeing specific information from a senior officer of landing  on  1st/2nd  of\nFebruary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_226\">Deposition of Vivek Vishwanath Kadam (PW-163)\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_227\">120)   PW-163  was  Inspector  of  Customs,  Marine  Preventive.

The said action could have prevented second landing  that  took\n      place subsequently.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_417\">122)  All the above said circumstances cumulatively  establish  the  charges\nframed against A-112 at the trial. The said circumstances leave no room  for\nany alternative hypothesis.  We  are  also  satisfied  that  pursuant  to  a\nconspiracy with Tiger Memon and his  other  co-conspirators,  A-112  misused\nhis official position in order to knowingly facilitate the terrorist act.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_418\">123)  Under these circumstances, we are satisfied that the  prosecution  has\nestablished the guilt against the appellant and  the  Designated  Court  has\nrightly convicted him and sentenced him.  Since he died during the  pendency\nof this  appeal,  there  cannot  be  any  direction  except  confirming  the\ndecision of the Designated Court and clarifying the  position.

He  also  submitted  that  though  the\nprosecution  has   relied   on   confessional   statement   of   co-accused,\nparticularly, Dawood @ Dawood Taklya  Mohd.  Phanse  @  Phanasmiyan  (A-14),\nKhalil Ahmed Syed Ali Nazir (A-42) and  Sujjad  Alam  @  Iqbal  Abdul  Hakim\nNazir (A-61),  they  have  not  attributed  to  any  specific  role  of  the\nappellant A-25.  He further submitted that the recoveries  alleged  to  have\nbeen made by the prosecution are  not  acceptable  and,  in  any  event,  it\ncontained several infirmities.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_244\">129)   Learned  counsel  appearing  for  the  CBI  refuted  all  the   above\ncontentions and after basing  reliance  on  oral  and  documentary  evidence\nsubmitted that the prosecution has established the charges  leveled  against\nthe appellant and the Designated Court has rightly convicted  and  sentenced\nhim for life.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_245\">Evidence\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_246\">130) The evidence against the appellant (A-25) is in the form of:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_428\">(i)   his own confession;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_429\">(ii)  confessions made by other co-conspirators; (co-accused);\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_430\">(iii) testimony of prosecution witnesses; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_431\">(iv)  documentary evidence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_432\">Confessional Statement of Muzammil Umar Kadri (A-25)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_433\">131)  The prosecution projected that the involvement of  the  appellant  (A-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_434\">25) in the conspiracy is evident from  his  own  confession  recorded  under\n<a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_267\">Section 15</a> of TADA on 17.04.1993 (14:00 hrs.) and  20.04.1993  (12:00  hrs.)\nby Shri Sanjay Pandey (PW-492), the then DCP, Zone-VIII, Bombay.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_435\">132)  It is seen that except the appellant, the recording  officer  (PW-492)\nasked all the persons to leave the Chamber and there was no  one  who  could\nhear and see the proceedings  of  the  same.   Thereafter,  PW-492  apprised\nabout himself and also ascertained whether he has any complaint against  the\npolice and also informed him that he is not bound to make  a  statement  and\nif such a statement is made, the same can  be  used  against  him.  He  also\nascertained whether any police official or any other person  threatened  him\nto make a statement etc.  After apprising  all  the  formalities  and  after\nsatisfying  himself  that  the  accused  is  willing  to  make  a  statement\nvoluntarily, he  directed  the  officer  concerned  for  production  of  the\naccused on 19.04.1993 after expiry of 48 hours.  It is further seen that  he\nwas produced on 20.04.1993 by API Gaikwad.   Again,  after  putting  several\nquestions to ascertain his willingness and genuineness, PW-492 recorded  his\nstatement.  Though learned counsel for the appellant submitted that  he  was\nforced to make such  a  statement,  a  perusal  of  the  entire  proceedings\nclearly show that the officer, who recorded  the  confession,  followed  the\nprocedure strictly and recorded his statement after satisfying himself  that\nthe accused is giving confession voluntarily without any pressure  from  any\ncorner.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_436\">133)  We were taken through the entire confession  of  the  appellant.   The\nconfession of appellant (A-25) is summarized below:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_437\">(i)   At the relevant time, he was an auto-rickshaw driver.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_438\">(ii)  He was a resident of Mhasla and became acquainted with  Dawood  Taklya\n      (A-14) who also lived in the same locality. He knew  that  Taklya  was\n      involved in the landing of smuggled goods.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_439\">(iii) He also knew that Rahim  Laundrywala  (deceased  accused)  and  Sharif\n      Abdul Gafoor Parkar @ Dadabhai (A-17)  were  the  partners  of  Dawood\n      Taklya in the aforesaid activities.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_440\">(iv)  In or around March-April 1992,  he  was  taken  by  Dawood  Taklya  to\n      Shekhadi for unloading of smuggled silver and its transportation to  a\n      Tower, at which time, he saw Tiger Memon, Anwar and  Shafi  (AA).  The\n      silver was smuggled by Tiger Memon.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_441\">(v)   He was paid Rs. 1,200/- by Dawood Taklya for the said assignment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_442\">(vi)  Again, in August, 1992, he was taken by Dawood Taklya to Shekhadi  for\n      unloading of smuggled silver and its transportation to Waghani  Tower,\n      at which time, Rahim Laundrywala and A-17 were also present.   He  was\n      paid Rs. 1,500/- by Dawood Taklya. The silver was  smuggled  by  Tiger\n      Memon.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_443\">(vii) In January, 1993, he was called  at  the  residence  of  Khalil  Ahmed\n      Sayed Ali Nasir (A-42) by Rahim Laundrywala and Shafi and was asked to\n      keep 16 rifles and 32 cassettes at his residence, which he  kept  with\n      him.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_444\">(viii)      On 03.02.1993, he  escorted  the  truck  carrying  the  smuggled\n      consignment from Borli to Waghani Tower  where  he  saw  Tiger  Memon,\n      Dawood Taklya, A-17, Anwar, Shafi and others.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_445\">(ix)  On 07.02.1993, Dawood had taken  the  appellant  to  Shekhadi  in  the\n      rickshaw of Sajjad Alam @ Iqbal Abdul Hakim  Nazir  (A-61)  since  the\n      appellant had already sold his rickshaw.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_446\">(x)   On 07.02.1993, at about 11.30 a.m., Dawood  Taklya  had  come  to  his\n      house in the rickshaw of A-61 and took 3 rifles and 6 magazines out of\n      the 16 rifles and 32 magazines which were kept at his house  and  told\n      that the message was received from Tiger Memon regarding the same.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_447\">(xi)  Thereafter, Dawood Taklya also took him in the  rickshaw  of  A-61  to\n      Shekhadi and they reached Shekhadi at about 9.00 p.m.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_448\">(xii) Thereafter, Sajjad Alam was told to go to the Tower  in  the  rickshaw\n      and the appellant was asked to get down at Mehendadi.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_449\">134)  Mr. Mushtaq Ahmad, learned counsel for the appellant, by  drawing  our\nattention to Exh. 1654 (Hindi version of his confession)  pointed  out  that\nthere are certain overlappings and corrections, hence,  in  the  absence  of\nany explanation, the same cannot be used against him.  In the light  of  the\nsaid contention, we  have  carefully  verified  the  translated  version  in\nEnglish.  We find no substance in the said contention.   On the other  hand,\nat several places, A-25 conveyed his desire to make a statement and  at  the\nend he informed the officer, who recorded the statement, that he  understood\neverything and the entire recorded statement is  true  and  acceptable.   In\nsuch circumstances,  we  are  unable  to  accept  the  stand  taken  by  the\nappellant.  However, though  the  very  same  appellant  had  retracted  his\nconfession but the same was done only on 03.10.1993, i.e., after  a  gap  of\nnearly about 6 months.  In the absence of any  proper  explanation  for  not\nretracting immediately  after  making  such  a  statement,  even  though  he\nappeared before the Magistrate/senior officers  on  several  occasions,  the\nfact remains that he had not retracted.  Even otherwise, as observed in  the\nearlier part of our judgment, a perusal of  the  retracted  statement  shows\nthat the same was prepared by someone and he merely signed the same.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_450\">135)  The panchnama dated 26.03.1993 was prepared in Marathi with regard  to\nrecoveries made from A-25.  The English translation of  the  same  was  also\nplaced on record.  Learned counsel for the appellant has  pointed  out  that\nout of 2 panch witnesses, namely, Mr. Walmik Shankar  Gite  and  Mr.  Laxman\nLoku Karkera, the prosecution has examined Mr.  Walmik  Shankar  Gite  only.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_247\">According to the counsel, he is a resident of Bombay and  he  was  taken  by\nthe police to a place which is at a distance of 250 km.

Thereafter,  each\n      of the AK-56 rifles was wrapped in a brown paper and the  said  packet\n      was tied by means of a  string  and  labels  of  signatures  of  panch\n      witnesses and his signature was affixed on each of the packet and  the\n      same were also sealed by using the lac seal and in the same manner the\n      26 empty magazines and the said 3 gunny bags were also  wrapped  in  a\n      brown paper and labelled and sealed. He recorded  the  description  of\n      the rifles and magazines in a panchanama by dictating  the  matter  to\n      PSI Nerlekar. He also took charge of the rifles, magazines  and  gunny\n      bags.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_258\">(viii)      The panchanama was read over to the panch  witnesses  and  their\n      signatures  were  obtained  to  ensure  its   correctness.

Even lengthy  cross-examination  of\nthe above witnesses has failed to destroy their testimonies.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_260\">142)  The recovered articles were sent to FSL for opinion by Waman  Kulkarni\n(PW-662) vide Exh. 2440 and a positive FSL Report Exh. 2440-A  was  received\nby the Police.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_261\">143)  Apart from the evidence of Police Inspector, i.e., PW-596, PW-588, PW-\n605 and PW-606, the abovesaid confessional statements of A-14, A-42  and  A-\n61 prove the prosecution  case  with  reference  to  the  role  of  A-25  in\nhandling and  transporting  arms  and  ammunitions  from  Shekhadi  port  to\nvarious places and it is also clear that arms were stored in his  house  and\ntaken to the place as directed by the Tiger.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_262\">144)  We have already highlighted the Panchnama containing all  the  details\nof arms and  ammunitions  collected  from  the  residence  of  A-25.   PW-45\nexplained all those details and he admitted the said Panchnama  as  well  as\nhis signature therein.  Though A-25 was represented by a counsel before  the\ntrial Court, there was no cross-examination at all.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_263\">145)  Taking note of all the above materials, the  Designated  Court,  after\nanalyzing the same, came to the conclusion that the  material  contained  in\nthe confession of  A-25  clearly  reveals  his  involvement  in  landing  at\nShekhadi and its transportation.  The corroborative  material  contained  in\nthe confession of A-25 i.e. his involvement in landing at Shekhadi  and  its\ntransportation, for which he was charged with, has also been proved  in  the\nconfessions of A-14, A-42 and A-61.  Considering  the  role  played  by  him\ni.e., he was possessing such a large number of arms  and  ammunitions  after\nthe Shekhadi operation was over and was holding the same for a  considerable\nperiod, the same also denotes that he was  a  man  of  close  confidence  of\nprime accused persons.  The Designated Court  also  rightly  concluded  that\nthe act committed by him was for furthering the object of conspiracy and  he\nhimself having committed the same during the  1st  half  of  February,  1993\ni.e. much prior to even Tiger Memon fixing the target for committing  serial\nbomb blasts in Bombay and is guilty for the offence of conspiracy to  commit\nterrorist acts punishable under <a href=\"/doc/105771932/\" id=\"a_272\">Section 3(3)</a> of TADA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_264\">146)  In view of the evidence discussed above, we hold  that  the  appellant\nwas actively involved in the conspiracy to cause blasts  in  Bombay  and  in\nconsequence of the said involvement,  he  has  committed  the  offences  for\nwhich he has been charged and we affirm the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_265\">147)  As rightly pointed out  by  the  prosecution,  the  facts  and  events\nstated by the appellant in his own confession are duly corroborated  by  the\nconfessions of other co-accused, thereby clearly revealing  his  involvement\nin the landings at Shekhadi and that he was unauthorisedly in possession  of\nthe  contraband  material.  Therefore,  the  appellant  is  guilty  for  the\noffences for which he has been charged from head firstly to fourthly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_266\">Appeal filed by the State of Maharashtra through CBI\nCriminal Appeal No. 1028 of 2012\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_267\">148)  Insofar as the appeal filed  by  the  CBI  against  acquittal  of  the\nappellant (A-25) for the charge mentioned at head firstly, viz.,  conspiracy\nis concerned, in view of the fact that  the  appellant  (A-25)  has  already\nbeen convicted for the same and sentenced to RI  for  life,  learned  senior\ncounsel for the CBI has not pressed the appeal before this Court, hence,  we\nare of the view that there is no need to consider this  appeal  in  view  of\nthe reason appended  above  and  therefore,  the  appeal  is  liable  to  be\ndismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_268\">Sentence:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_484\">149)  Regarding sentence, the prosecution submitted that the  appellant  was\ngiven full opportunity to defend himself  on  the  question  of  quantum  of\nsentence.  His statement was recorded on 17.10.2006 (Exh.2984) in  which  he\nprayed that the following factors, amongst others, may be  considered  while\ndetermining his sentence :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_485\">        i) He is the sole bread winner of his family comprising of his wife\n           and three small children; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_486\">       ii) His wife is suffering from a mental ailment.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_269\">With respect to the above contentions regarding  quantum  of  sentence,  the\nprosecution submitted that the appellant was in possession  and  storage  of\n13 AK-56 rifles and 26 magazines for a considerable period of time.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_270\">150)   From  the  materials,  it  is  clear  that  the   appellant   neither\ndissociated himself nor resisted  from  participating  in  the  landings  at\nShekhadi or transportation of contraband material to Waghani Tower  nor  did\nhe inform the same to the police authorities  or  took  any  steps  for  the\nsame. This is sufficient to show that he was responsible for the  blasts  in\nBombay and he was very well aware of its consequences.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_271\">151)  In view of the above, we are of the view that the sentence awarded  by\nthe Designated  Court  to  the  appellant  is  justified  and  the  same  is\nconfirmed.

The  driver  of\n      PW-94 became conversant with A-116 and as a result  the  witness  also\n      became conversant with A-116.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_530\">(ii)  He stated that in March, 1993, the appellant came  to  his  house  and\n      told him that while he (PW 94) was away in January 1993, the appellant\n      had kept five silver bricks in his room.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_531\">(iii) On being asked as to why  the  appellant  had  kept  the  same,  A-116\n      replied that he placed the same as nobody could have seen it as he was\n      not at his house.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_532\">(iv)   He stated that the appellant had telephoned  him  and  asked  him  in\n      first or second week of January, 1993 that there  was  a  function  of\n      offering ‘oaty’ at his residence and people who had arrived from Mahad\n      for the said function were waiting outside the sweetmeat shop and that\n      he should take the ‘burfi’ which was with  the  said  persons  to  his\n      house.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_533\">(v)   He stated that he reached on motorcycle to the Naka and two  or  three\n      persons were standing and one of them took two packets  wrapped  in  a\n      newspaper and kept the same in the dickey of  his  motorcycle.  Later,\n      the appellant came following him from behind.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_534\">(vi)  He stated that on the way, the appellant asked  him  to  handover  the\n      ‘burfi’ (sweets) to him since he was also going  home.  The  appellant\n      thereafter took both the packets.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_535\">161)  From the perusal of the above, it is clear that:-\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_536\">(i)   The appellant was well known to the accused persons  who  referred\nto him in casual manner.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_537\">(ii)   The  police  party,  after  checking  both  the  trucks   for   a\nconsiderable period of time had negotiations with the smugglers.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_538\">(iii) Pursuant to the negotiations, the appellant demanded a sum of  Rs.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_309\">8/10 lakhs from the smugglers and kept 4-5 silver bars as  a  token  for\nsecurity.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_310\">(iv)  The keys of the jetty were given to Shabbir (AA) at  the  instance\nof the police.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_311\">(v)   The appellant paid Rs. 2,000/- to PW-156 which was handed over  to\nhim by Mane (A-101) for giving keys of the Jetty to Shabbir.\nIt is relevant to mention that the said  witness  was  not  even  cross-\nexamined on behalf of the appellant (A-116).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_312\">Other witnesses:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_539\">Deposition of Yeshwant Govind Kadam (PW-109)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_540\">162)  PW-109 is a panch witness and deposed that Panchnama dated  21.04.1993\nmarked as Exhibit 563 was drawn in his presence. The said Panchnama  records\nthat Ramesh Dattatray Mali (A-101), Police Constable was given Rs.  15,000/-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_313\">by A-116 in connection with smuggling matter and this money was produced  by\nMali (A-101) in presence of two panchas.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_314\">163)  The said witness also deposed about the  Panchnama  dated  22.04.1993\nmarked as Exhibit 564.  The panchnama records that out of the monies  taken\nby A-116 in smuggling, he handed over Rs. 25,000/- to P.C. Krishna  Tukaram\nPingle, B. No. 1499 and that P.C. Pingle was producing the money  taken  in\nthe Police Station.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_315\">164)  He further deposed and proved the Panchnama dated  25.04.1993  marked\nas Exh. 565 which records that Inspector Ashok Narayan Muneshwar (A-70) was\ngiven Rs. 30,000 in connection with smuggling of goods at Dighi and that he\nproduced the said money in front of panchas.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_316\">165)  By pointing out the above evidence, learned senior  counsel  for  the\nappellant, argued that  at  the  most  it  denotes  that  at  the  time  of\ninterception, the police found only silver bricks in one truck and  similar\nbricks and some boxes in the other truck.  Even after counting, they  found\n100 silver bricks and some boxes.   He  further  submitted  that  when  the\npolice enquired about the contents of the  boxes,  Chacha  (A-136)  replied\nthat the boxes contained ‘watches’. In other words, according to  him,  the\nevidence and the entire materials relied on by the prosecution denote  that\nthe police had knowledge of only  silver  bricks  and  watches,  i.e.,  the\ncontents of the boxes.    Finally,  he  submitted  that  the  knowledge  in\nfurtherance of the act of abetment as contemplated under  <a href=\"/doc/105771932/\" id=\"a_305\">Section  3(3)</a>  of\nTADA seems to be absent and cannot be inferred on  the  basis  of  surmises\nmerely because the appellant was the PSI.  In the  light  of  the  vehement\narguments, we have carefully analysed the  prosecution  witnesses  and  the\nmaterials placed.  Here again, we are unable to concur with the  arguments.\nOn the other hand, we are unable to accept the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_317\">166)  On perusal of the entire evidence as placed by the  prosecution,  the\nfollowing facts emerge:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_541\">(i)   The appellant (A-116) arranged for the keys to  be  given  to  Shabbir\n      (AA) for the purposes of landing.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_542\">(ii)  A police  party  led  by  the  appellant  intercepted  two  trucks  at\n      Gondghar Phata and after checking for a considerable  period  of  time\n      and after negotiating for half an hour, let them off;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_543\">(iii) The appellant was well acquainted with the smugglers;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_544\">(iv)  The appellant had secret negotiations with the smugglers  as  well  as\n      consultation with the Custom official Gurav   (A-82)  for  fixing  the\n      special bribe amount;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_545\">(v)   The appellant took silver bars as security in lieu of  cash  and  kept\n      the same in the house of PW-94 who duly  corroborates  with  the  fact\n      that he kept the bars in his house;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_546\">(vi)  The appellant paid Rs. 2,000/- to PW-156 for handing over the keys  of\n      the Dighi Jetty to Shabbir Kadri (AA) on 09.01.1993 the day when  arms\n      and ammunitions landed at Dighi.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_318\">It may be pointed out here that  sufficient  evidence  has  been  placed  on\nrecord by the prosecution to show that part of the consignment which  landed\nat Dighi was also delivered to Tiger Memon.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_319\">Sentence\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_320\">167)  Coming to sentence, it is not in dispute that  the  appellant  (A-116)\nwas the head of the police party.  The evidence  clearly  reveals  that  the\nappellant was primarily responsible for the decision arrived at in  allowing\nthe said contraband smuggled material to be transported further without  the\nsame being intercepted/checked by the police in lieu of the bribe amount  to\nbe received.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_321\">168)  Further, the appellant was given full opportunity  to  defend  himself\non the question of quantum  of  sentence.   The  appellant  filed  statement\ndated 24.01.2007 on the  quantum  of  sentence  which  is  Exh.  2954.   The\nappellant  prayed  that  the  following,  amongst  other  factors,  may   be\nconsidered while determining his sentence:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_547\">(i)   He was the sole bread winner of his family; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_548\">(ii)  He was in the government service.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_549\">169)  The Designated Court, after considering the  factors  pleaded  by  the\nappellant and the nature of crime committed by him, held as under:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_550\">      “499…..considering the facts that A-116 was head of local  police  and\n      as such was duty bound to make every attempt to prevent commission  of\n      a crime, but instead of carrying his duty, he had  allowed  commission\n      of crime and so also further  crimes  by  allowing  transportation  of\n      contraband material and having acted in such a manner for receiving  a\n      bribe amount makes it extremely difficult  to  accept  submission  for\n      leniency….”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_551\">170)  As rightly pointed out by learned senior  counsel  for  the  CBI,  the\ncrime of the appellant may be considered in the light of the  fact  that  he\nwas the protector of law and he has breached the trust of the people of  the\ncountry.  Had he honestly done his duty, perhaps the  whole  disaster  could\nhave been obviated.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_552\">171)  In the light of the above, we  are  of  the  view  that  the  sentence\nawarded by the Designated Court to the appellant  is  justified.  The  above\nsaid evidence substantiates and establishes the charge of conspiracy  framed\nagainst the appellant (A-116).   We  fully  agree  with  the  reasoning  and\nultimate conclusion of the Designated  Court  both  on  the  conviction  and\nsentence.  Consequently, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_322\">                       Criminal Appeal No. 401 of 2008\n\n\nMohd.

Dossa’s body guard.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_574\">(vii) The appellant was involved in the delivery of gold to various  persons\n      in Bombay including Raju Kodi (A-26).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_575\">(viii)      Tiger Memon used to work  with  Mohd.  Dossa  and  separated  in\n      1989.  In 1992,  the  appellant  became  a  partner  of  5%  share  in\n      smuggling activities along with  Mechanic  Chacha  (A-136)  and  Feroz\n      Abdul Rafiq.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_576\">(ix)  In the year 1992, the appellant participated in about  8  landings  of\n      silver in Ratnagiri (at Mhasla  and  Dighi)  and  more  landings  near\n      Mangalore.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_577\">(x)   In 1992, the appellant took part in the murder of  Mussa,  a  smuggler\n      in Bangalore.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_578\">(xi)  In the first week of January, 1993, the  appellant  accompanied  Mohd.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_579\">      Dossa for a meeting with Customs officers,  including  Mr.  Singh  (A-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_580\">      102), Mr. Sayed (A-90) and one more officer at Hotel  Persian  Darbar,\n      Panvel.  In the meeting which went  on  for  3/4  hours,  Mohd.  Dossa\n      discussed about landing operations and  it  was  agreed  that  Customs\n      officers will be paid Rs.7-8 lacs per landing.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_581\">(xii) Few days after the above meeting, A-138 called Mohd. Dossa from  Dubai\n      and asked him to make arrangements for landing.  Mohd. Dossa then told\n      the appellant that large quantity of arms  and  ammunitions  had  left\n      Dubai for landing and asked him to go to Dighi at  Mhasla  and  inform\n      the Customs officers.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_582\">(xiii)      The  appellant,  thereafter,  informed  the  Customs  officials,\n      viz., Mr. Singh (A-102) and Mr. Sayed (A-90) who gave  permission  for\n      the said landing.  The appellant was present  when  the  landing  took\n      place at Dighi Jetty.  Mechanic Chacha (A-136) and Uttam Poddar (A-30)\n      were also present there.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_583\">(xiv) About 250-300 silver ingots, 25-30 wooden boxes and 15-20 canvas  bags\n      were landed at Dighi.  These items were loaded in  trucks  which  were\n      subsequently intercepted  by  the  Police.   The  appellant  tried  to\n      convince the police  officer  who  was  annoyed  because  he  had  not\n      received money for the landing.  Thereafter, Uttam Poddar  (A-30)  and\n      Customs officer Gurav (A-82) negotiated with the police, which let the\n      trucks pass for a bribe of Rs. 10 lacs.  The Police officers kept  6/7\n      silver ingots in lieu of cash of Rs. 10 lakhs.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_584\">(xv)  The appellant noticed that one  wooden  box  was  containing  4  AK-56\n      rifles and 12 empty magazines and also  that  some  other  boxes  were\n      containing hand grenades and their pins.  The military coloured canvas\n      bags were found to be containing four tin boxes in each bag which were\n      filled with ammunition for AK-56 rifles.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_585\">(xvi) The aforesaid bags were fitted in the cavities made in the  truck  and\n      the leftover goods were shifted to the house  of  Shabbir  Kadri  (AA)\n      where the appellant and others also stayed after landing.\n(xvii)      During the stay  at  Shabbir’s  house,  Arif  Lamboo  and  Afzal\n      Gadbad collected the silver ingots and few  wooden  boxes  and  canvas\n      bags and delivered them to Ahmed  Okliya  of  Surat,  Gujarat  on  the\n      instructions of Mustafa Majnu (A-138).  The appellant was also told by\n      Afsal Gadbad that some arms and ammunitions were delivered by  him  at\n      Panvel to a man of Tiger Memon.  3-4 wooden boxes  and  a  few  canvas\n      bags still remained at Shabbir’s house.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_586\">(xviii)     On the day of landing which  took  place  in  the  beginning  of\n      second week of January, 1993, Mohd. Dossa was present at his office in\n      Bombay.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_587\">(xix) The appellant along with several other  co-accused  persons  left  for\n      Dubai in the beginning of February, 1993  where  they  stayed  for  15\n      days.  In Dubai, the appellant met Dawood Ibrahim where he told him to\n      be ready for revenge and riots and that for this purpose they would be\n      given training in use of weapons at Pakistan.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_588\">(xx)  2-3 days after the meeting with Dawood Ibrahim,  Abu  Bakar  (AA)  and\n      others left for Pakistan for receiving training.   The  appellant  had\n      gone to see them off at Dubai Airport.  These persons were  told  that\n      someone would come at the Airport in Pakistan to receive them.\n(xxi) On return, those co-accused persons told the appellant that  they  had\n      received weapons training at  Pakistan  and  that  they  were  met  by\n      Pakistani officers at the  Airport  who  took  them  out  without  any\n      immigration formalities.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_589\">(xxii)      The appellant was in Bombay on the day  of  the  blasts  but  he\n      denied the participation in the blasts.  He, however, fled  to  Bombay\n      and stayed in Delhi, Uttar Pradesh and a  ‘neighbouring  country’  and\n      continued to work for Mohd. Dossa in smuggling of gold.\n(xxiii)     In July, 1993,  the  appellant  on  the  instructions  of  Mohd.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_338\">      Dossa, removed AK-56 rifles, hand  grenades,  small  bombs  and  2,000\n      cartridges lying with Ahmed Okliya of Surat, Gujarat.

When\n      silver was being uploaded, the captain of ship asked to  unload  other\n      things too, viz., (i) 15-20 wooden boxes, and (ii) 15-20 tin boxes.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_374\">(xiii)      A-134 spoke to Mustafa Dossa over telephone about  the  contents\n      of the boxes and, thereafter, told A-136 to unload the ‘samaan’ in the\n      truck. ‘Samaan’ is the lingo for arms in gangster’s language.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_375\">(xiv) He was travelling in the car and the truck and the tempo  loaded  with\n      arms were following the car.

Meanwhile, A-\n      30 along with A-82 came there and spoke to Patil (A-116)  and  it  was\n      decided that Rs. 8 lakhs would be given to the police.\n(xvi) Patil (A-116) kept 5 silver bars as security for  a  bribe  of  Rs.  8\n      lacs to let the trucks pass through.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_377\">(xvii)      The  truck  with  arms  moved  towards  village  Agarwada  where\n      Shabbir Qadri (AA) resided. It is  further  seen  that  from  Agarwada\n      village, arms were loaded into cavities of another truck and  sent  to\n      Gujarat. Some arms which could not be  fitted  into  the  cavities  of\n      trucks left with Shabbir Qadri at his residence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_378\">(xix) He got scared that the arms deposited by Ahmed Aulia  in  his  village\n      might be caught leading perhaps to his arrest also.\n(xx)  He moved to Nepal after 2-3 months of the blasts to evade  arrest.  In\n      Nepal, he met Mohd. Dossa (AA), Salim Kutta (A-134), and  Feroz  (AA),\n      amongst others. He was aware that police was in search of him and that\n      the court has also issued a warrant for his arrest.\n(xxi) Some of the rifles unloaded at Dighi Jetty  on  09.01.1993  were  with\n      Ahmed Aulia who was not returning them. He told his  wife  about  this\n      and she passed this information to Crime Branch.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_379\">(xxii)      The arms which landed at Dighi were brought from Pakistan   near\n      Karachi. One boat went to Porbandar and some arms landed there also.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_380\">194)  As  against  this,  counsel  for  the  appellant  submitted  that  the\nappellant came to be arrested on 04.11.1999, i.e.,  after  the  evidence  of\nmost of the witnesses was over.  Shri O.P. Chhatwal (PW-684), the  then  SP,\nCBI-STF, New Delhi - the officer who recorded his  confession,  was  present\nat the time of his arrest.  He further pointed out  that  in  spite  of  his\nadvocate’s information that A-136 does not  intend  to  give  confession,  a\nconfession was obtained from him on 09.11.1999.  In the light of  the  above\nobjections, we have  carefully  verified  his  entire  statement,  procedure\nfollowed, voluntariness etc., of the confession and we  are  satisfied  that\nthere is no substance in the above objections.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"818231\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"799818\" id=\"span_4\">In  view  of  the  objection\nthat the Supervising Officer (PW-684 herein) cannot be permitted  to  record\nconfession of an accused, this Court has rejected this objection  vide  <a href=\"/doc/799818/\" id=\"a_378\">S.N.\nDube vs. N.B.

A  summary  of  the\nconfession of A-30 implicating the appellant is as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_680\">(i)   He was a landing agent and worked for Mohd. Dossa. He described  A-136\n      as the ‘main person’ in the gang and that A-136 had asked A-30 to work\n      for Mohd.

The\nprosecution  submitted  that  the  confession  of  A-81,  a  fisherman,  who\nparticipated in the landing at Dighi, corroborates with the  fact  that  the\nappellant was talking on wireless after  which  a  trawler  came  within  10\nminutes towards the Jetty.  They  unloaded  silver  bricks  and  30  bundles\nwrapped in gunny clothes around the box and 30 military coloured bags.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_395\">      198)  It is contended by  the  counsel  for  the  appellant  that  the\nconfession statements of A-30, A-81 and A-82  cannot  be  read  in  evidence\nagainst A-136 as they were recorded prior to amendment of TADA  i.e.  before\n22.05.1995.

After careful  examination\nof all the materials placed, we are of the view that in the absence  of  any\npositive evidence, A-136 cannot be convicted under the charge  mentioned  at\nhead  firstly,  i.e.,  conspiracy  and  the  Designated  Court  has  rightly\nacquitted him from the said charge.  In the light of the  above  discussion,\nthe appeal of the State is liable to be dismissed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_707\">202)  Considering the evidence brought on record, the Designated Court  held\n(Part 11):\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_708\">      “43-A)      The aforesaid material in confession  of  A-136  not  only\n      reveals his own involvement  in Dighi landing episode and himself  had\n      become aware at Dighi Jetty that the material brought by sea were also\n      containing arms and ammunitions  but  also  discloses  involvement  of\n      other co-accused in commission of an act as depicted by the same.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_709\">      43-B) The corroborative material to the matters found in confession of\n      A-136 regarding his such a deep involvement in Dighi  landing  episode\n      is also found in confession of co-accused A-30, 81 &amp; 134.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_710\">      43-C) Thus carefully considering material contained in confession of A-\n      136 and that of the  aforesaid  co-accused  definitely  leads  to  the\n      conclusion of A-136 who was close  associate  of  Mohammed  Dossa  and\n      Mustafa Dossa the main person responsible for  Dighi  landing,  having\n      committed the offences for which he was charged with at head 2nd ly to\n      3rd ly.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_402\">      133) Now considering the acts committed by A-136 and more particularly\n      his continuing with the convoy containing arms, his  participation  in\n      settlement with the police for allowing the convoy to proceed  further\n      inspite of his later on knowledge that the same was containing weapons\n      in light of the aforesaid observation leads to no other conclusion but\n      himself having  continued to commit the landing operation and  further\n      overt acts now for achieving the  object  of  conspiracy.    Similarly\n      taking into account that the contraband goods were to contain arms and\n      ammunition i.e. the smuggled goods which could not have been  put  for\n      any lawful use fortifies the conclusion of A-136  having  abetted  the\n      acts which were committed by  the  conspirators  and/or  rendered  the\n      assistance to them by contravening  the  provisions  of  law.  Such  a\n      conclusion legitimately flows from the said  material  even  accepting\n      that A-136 had earlier no knowledge that the goods which  had  arrived\n      at Dighi Jetty were containing the arms.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_403\">      271)  Now considering the liability of  A-136  as  revealed  from  the\n      earlier discussion but without once again repeating the dilation  made\n      earlier it can be said that the same having revealed  that  A-136  had\n      become aware about the nature of goods after he was told regarding the\n      same and the direction of accused Mustafa Dossa by A-134.  As  dilated\n      earlier, it is clear that though A-136 had  continued  with  the  said\n      operation i.e. the operation of smuggling  for  which  he  had  agreed\n      earlier and in the process having committed the offence<a href=\"/doc/105771932/\" id=\"a_384\"> u/s.3  (3)</a>  of\n      TADA still he  cannot  be  said  to  be  guilty  for  the  offence  of\n      conspiracy to which A-134 was said to be party.  Needless to add  that\n      considering the  acts  committed  by  A-136,  his  liability  remained\n      confined to having committed the offence<a href=\"/doc/105771932/\" id=\"a_385\"> u/s.3(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/47052902/\" id=\"a_386\">Sec. 6</a> of TADA”.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_404\">Sentence:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_711\">203)  It is contended by the counsel  for  the  appellant  that  A-136  was\narrested on 04.11.1999 and has already undergone the sentence of about more\nthan 8 ½ (eight and a half) years of actual imprisonment.   The  Designated\nCourt also heard the appellant on the quantum of sentence.  Taking note  of\nall the materials  and  proved  charges  mentioned  at  head  secondly  and\nthirdly, we are satisfied that the sentence awarded by the Designated Court\ncannot be said to be excessive.  On the other hand, we are of the view that\nthe  sentence  awarded  by  the  Designated  Court  to  the  appellant   is\njustifiable and acceptable, hence, the appeal is liable to be dismissed.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_405\">                    Criminal Appeal Nos. 976-977 of 2008\n\n\nNasir Abdul Kader Kewal\n@ Nasir Dakhla (A-64)                        …..Appellant(s)\n\n                 vs.\n\nThe State of Maharashtra,\nthrough STF, CBI, Mumbai                       ...Respondent(s)\n\n\n                                  *********\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_406\">204)  Mr. Priyadarshi Manish, learned counsel appeared for the appellant (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_407\">64) and Mr. Mukul  Gupta,  learned  senior  counsel  duly  assisted  by  Mr.\nSatyakam, learned counsel for the respondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_408\">205)  The present appeals are directed against the final judgment and  order\nof conviction and sentence dated  05.10.2006  and  31.05.2007  respectively,\nwhereby the appellant (A-64) has been convicted and  sentenced  to  rigorous\nimprisonment (RI) for life by  the  Designated  Court  under  TADA  for  the\nBombay Bomb Blast Case, Greater Bombay in B.B.C.

It  is  also\ncontended that the confessional statements of the  co-accused  above  as\nrelied upon by the prosecution against him were subsequently  retracted,\nand therefore, it is not safe to base  the  conviction  on  any  of  the\naforesaid confessions.  It has been further contended on behalf  of  the\nappellant that he was, in fact, arrested on 29.12.1994 though his arrest\nhas been shown on    03.01.1995  and  on  04.01.1995,  he  was  produced\nbefore the Magistrate and that he was tortured, coerced and  induced  to\nmake a confession. The prosecution pointed out that upon perusal of  the\norder dated 04.01.1995, it is  clear  that  no  complaint  of  any  ill-\ntreatment at the hands of police  was  made  by  the  appellant  or  his\ncounsel and further even  during  the  remand  till  25.01.1995  he  was\npermitted to meet his relatives and was allowed to consult  his  lawyer.\nThe prosecution further pointed out that the confession of the appellant\nwas recorded on 22.01.1995 and 24.01.1995 and on 04.02.1995,  20.02.1995\nand 13.03.1995 he was produced before the Designated Court and on  which\ndates also no complaint of any torture, coercion or ill-treatment at the\nhands of police was made by the appellant.  In fact, after recording  of\nthe confession, on 25.01.1995, he was  produced  before  the  Magistrate\nalongwith his confessional statement.  In view of the same, there is  no\nsubstance in the contention raised by the  counsel  for  the  appellant.\nThe legality and acceptability of the confessions of the co-accused  has\nalready been considered by us in the earlier part of our discussion.\nDeposition of Prosecution Witnesses:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_769\">215)  Apart from the aforesaid evidence, the involvement and the role of\nthe appellant in the conspiracy, as stated above, is  disclosed  by  the\ndeposition of various prosecution witnesses which are as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_770\">Deposition of Mohd.

His  deposition\nreveals the following:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_783\">(i)   He knew the appellant for the last  10  years  as  he  resided  in\n      Mahim, where the appellant also resided.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_784\">(ii)  He travelled to  Dubai  on  17.02.1993  by  an  Emirates  Airlines\n      flight.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_785\">(iii) When PW-367 was standing in the queue for boarding  pass,  he  saw\n      the appellant and Yeda Yakub who were also  standing  in  the  same\n      queue.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_786\">(iv)  He identified the appellant in the court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_787\">(v)   In Dubai, he stayed in Hotel Delhi Darbar where he again  met  the\n      appellant.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_491\">The aforesaid deposition of PW-367 corroborates with the  confession  of\nthe appellant as well as the evidence of PW-2.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_492\">Deposition of Harishchandra Singh (PW-474)\n      The confession of the appellant was recorded by PW-474,  the  then\nSuperintendent of Police, CBI/SPE/STF, New Delhi. His deposition reveals\nthe following:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_788\">(i)   He had not taken any part  in  the  investigation  of  the  Bombay\n      Blasts case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_789\">(ii)  He received a telephonic request  from  Deputy  Superintendent  of\n      Police,  Rishi  Prakash  of  CBI/STF,  Bombay,  for  recording  the\n      confession of the appellant; accordingly,  he  reached  the  Bombay\n      office on 22.01.1995.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_790\">(iii) Thereafter, a written request was made to him  for  recording  the\n      said confession and  after  making  endorsement  upon  the  request\n      letter, he asked for the appellant to be produced before him.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_791\">(iv)  He ensured that the appellant was making  a  voluntary  confession\n      and that he was not pressurized, coerced or threatened  by  anybody\n      to give the confession. He also gave him time till  24.01.1995  for\n      re-consideration of his desire to make a confession.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_792\">(v)   On 24.01.1995, the appellant was again produced before  him.  They\n      were the only persons in the Chamber.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_793\">(vi)  He ascertained whether sufficient time was given to the  appellant\n      for re-consideration or not  and  warned  the  appellant  that  any\n      confession made by him would be used against him.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_794\">(vii) He recorded the confession of the appellant and also read it  over\n      to him.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_795\">(viii)      The appellant told him that  the  confession  was  correctly\n      recorded and the same was also signed by him as well as by PW-474.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_796\">216)  We are satisfied with the deposition of PW-474 that the confession\nof the appellant was recorded in accordance with  the  prescribed  rules\nand after following the due process of law.  No  discrepancy  whatsoever\nhas been established on  behalf  of  the  appellant  pertaining  to  the\naforesaid deposition.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_797\">Sentence:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_798\">217)  The  prosecution  pointed  out  that  the  appellant  was  given  full\nopportunity to defend himself on the question of quantum of  sentence.   His\nstatement was recorded on 06.10.2006 in which he prayed that  the  following\nfactors, amongst others, may be considered while determining his sentence:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_799\">(i)   He has been in custody since 03.01.1995;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_800\">(ii)  His wife is suffering from TB and low  blood  pressure  since  last  8\nyears and his son had suffered head injury;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_801\">(iii) He had been to Shekhadi under the impression that it  was  landing  of\nsilver goods and after realizing that it was not  silver,  he  disassociated\nhimself from the landing;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_802\">(iv)  He was forced to participate in the second landing since Tiger  Memon,\nJaved Chikna and others had threatened to kill his family members;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_803\">(v)   In the said conspiratorial meetings, he protested  to  carry  out  any\noperation as it was the month of Ramzan but he was threatened by  Tiger  and\nJaved that he would be shot on the spot if he backs out;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_804\">(vi)  If he gets a chance, he would be able to look  after  his  family  and\nwould be able to lead the life as a law abiding citizen; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_805\">(vii) Ultimately, he was not involved in the  commission  of  any  terrorist\nact and for the acts committed by him, he had undergone sufficient  sentence\nsince he has been in custody for about 12  years  (as  on  date  approx.  18\nyears), so a lenient view be taken while awarding sentence to him.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_806\">218)  It is pointed out by the prosecution that all the above  factors  have\nbeen duly considered by the Designated Court and the  aforesaid  contentions\nare devoid of any merit having regard to the fact  that  the  appellant  had\nsufficient  potential  for  commission  of  terrorist  acts  owing  to  have\nacquired  training  in  handling  sophisticated  arms  and  ammunitions   at\nPakistan. Further, it is stated that his contention that he  was  forced  to\nparticipate in the second  landing  since  Tiger  Memon,  Javed  Chikna  and\nothers had threatened to kill his family members is not tenable  as  despite\nbeing threatened at the time of first landing and  after  getting  knowledge\nthat the said landing was of arms and ammunitions and explosives,  he  chose\nto remain silent instead of approaching the police  or  taking  recourse  to\nlaw.   Despite all this, he participated in the second landing at  Shekhadi,\nand moreover, he went to Pakistan at the instance of the  same  persons  who\nhad threatened him. Further, when Tiger Memon asked  him  to  be  ready,  he\ntold him that he was ready on the night of 11.03.1993.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_807\">219)  It is clear that the contention on behalf of  the  appellant  that  he\ndissociated himself at the time of the first  landing  at  Shekhadi  is  not\nmade out in the light of other evidence on record.  Further,  the  appellant\nparticipated in  the  acts  mentioned  above  willingly  and  with  complete\nknowledge.  He knew that the arms and ammunitions,  RDX  and  hand  grenades\nwhich were smuggled into India at Shekhadi  would  be  used  for  committing\nterrorist acts.  It is clearly established from his  confession  that  Tiger\nMemon had told his associates that the smuggled arms  were  to  be  used  to\ntake revenge for the demolition of Babri Masjid and for  causing  blasts  in\nBombay.  As submitted, the above fact had come to his  knowledge  after  the\nlanding at Shekhadi and much before his going to  Pakistan.   Despite  that,\nhe went to Pakistan via Dubai and received training in handling of arms  and\nammunitions and explosives.  Even in Dubai, he attended  the  conspiratorial\nmeeting convened by Tiger Memon in which oath was administered  to  maintain\nsecrecy regarding the aforesaid training and to take revenge.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_808\">220)  It is also relevant to note that after realizing that explosions  took\nplace at various places in Bombay on  12.03.1993,  the  appellant  absconded\nand remained away from the clutches of law until  he  was  arrested  by  the\npolice.  He stayed at various places in assumed names in  order  to  conceal\nhis identity to  avoid  his  arrest.   Thus,  his  fleeing  away  after  the\nexplosions took place only goes to show his association and  involvement  in\nthe conspiracy to cause blasts and, undoubtedly, he was a part  of  it.   It\nalso points out his guilt in the commission of the said acts in  furtherance\nof the conspiracy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_809\">221)  Therefore, in view of the entire evidence enumerated  above,  we  hold\nthat the appellant was actively involved in the conspiracy to  cause  blasts\nin Bombay and in consequence of the said involvement, he has  committed  the\nsaid offences for which he has been charged and the sentence awarded by  the\nDesignated Court to the appellant is justified.  Consequently,  the  appeals\nfail and are liable to be dismissed.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_493\">                       Criminal Appeal No. 616 of 2008\n\nSalim Rahim Shaikh @ Salim\nBabu Wrane (A-52)                                         ....

Shakil requested me to book one red coloured Maruti  Van\n      in the name of Asif Darvesh resident of M.G. Road, Indore and  another\n      new Maruti Van of blue colour in the name of Shri Kasam Ahmed residing\n      at Indira Nagar, Ujjain.  He also requested me to  register  both  the\n      Maruti Van at Indore and send the same to Bombay.   He  also  told  me\n      that the payments of the same would be made at Bombay to  the  driver.\n      I  quoted  a  price  of  Rs.1,69,000/-  per   vehicle   inclusive   of\n      registration and transport charges.  I was having red coloured  Maruti\n      Van brought by me from M/s Bhatia &amp; Company, Gurgaon, Haryana and blue\n      coloured Maruti Van brought from Vipul Motors, Faridabad, Haryana,  in\n      my stock.  I had brought both the  said  vehicles  by  making  advance\n      payment.  After receipt of booking from Shakil Hasham for red and blue\n      coloured brand  new  Maruti  Vans,  I  informed  the  details  of  the\n      purchasers to M/s Bhatia Company and M/s Vipul Motors.  After  receipt\n      of the said letters and bills from both the said companies in the name\n      of purchasers who wanted red and blue Maruti Vans  I  sent  papers  of\n      both the Vans for registration to RTO.  The blue coloured  Maruti  Van\n      was registered in the name of Kasam Ahmed at  Ujjain  RTO.   The  blue\n      coloured Maruti Van could not be registered at Indore due to lack of E-\n      Form necessary for registration.  Thereafter, I  sent  both  the  said\n      Vans to Bombay to Shakil Hasham.  Shakil Hasham received the  delivery\n      and paid Rs.3,38,000/- to my drivers.  My drivers gave the said amount\n      to me.  I made the necessary entries in my office record  for  sending\n      the said Vans to Bombay to Shakil Hasham after purchasing the same for\n      the parties told by him.   The  RTO  Authority  at  Ujjain  had  given\n      registration Number MP-13-D-0385 to “blue coloured Maruti Van.   Today\n      I am not remembering the engine number and chassis number of the  said\n      Maruti Van.””\n\nDepostion of Shakeel Suleman Hasham (PW-366)\n      In his deposition, he deposed that he had asked PW-342 to arrange  for\ntwo Maruti Vans (red and blue colour) in  February,  1993.   Both  the  vans\nwere purchased in Madhya Pradesh and the blue Maruti Van was  registered  in\nUjjain with the registration number MP-13-D-0385.

The said vehicles  were  registered  at\n      Madhya Pradesh Indore in the name of the purchasers  given  to  me  by\n      Suleman Lakdawala. I had given the work of registration to one Kailash\n      baheti of Indore. Both the said vans were insured by  Insurance  Agent\n      Rakesh Tiwari before giving the same to Suleman  Lakdawala.  Both  the\n      said vehicles had arrived from Indore.

With  respect  to  this\ncontention, it is submitted that  the  deposition  of  PW-469,  the  Special\nExecutive Magistrate who  conducted  the  said  TIP,  does  not  reveal  any\nmaterial extracted during the cross-examination or otherwise for  coming  to\nthe conclusion that the dummies selected were of  dissimilar  appearance.  A\ncareful perusal of the evidence of PW-469 and the  Memorandum  Exh.1506,  in\nfact, reveals that two suspects were put for the parade alongwith  about  10\ndummies. The reference to  the  Memorandum  also  reveals  that  PW-469  had\nselected 10 persons of similar appearances  with  the  suspects  out  of  25\ndummies brought by the police. Further, para-26 of  his  deposition  reveals\nthat though his evidence is silent regarding the selection of  the  dummies,\nhe had asked the police to send 10 dummies and two  panchas  to  the  parade\nroom.  Thus, in view of this, it is proved that the prosecution has  adduced\nsufficient  evidence  regarding  the  dummies  selected  being  of   similar\nappearance with the suspects put in the parade.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_678\">261)  In the light of  the  above  evidence,  it  is  established  that  the\nappellant had thrown hand  grenade  towards  the  aircraft  thereby  causing\nexplosion and consequent damage.

The contradictions  pointed  out\nby the counsel on behalf of the appellant are minor contradictions and  does\nnot go to the root of the matter.  With regard to the  same,  the  following\nobservations of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/572710/\" id=\"a_613\">State of Uttar  Pradesh  vs.  Krishna  Master</a>,\n(2010) 12 SCC 324 are relevant.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_723\">      15. Before appreciating evidence of  the  witnesses  examined  in  the\n      case,  it  would  be  instructive  to  refer  to  the   criteria   for\n      appreciation of oral evidence. While appreciating the  evidence  of  a\n      witness, the approach must be whether the evidence of the witness read\n      as a whole appears to have a ring of truth. Once  that  impression  is\n      found, it is undoubtedly necessary for the  court  to  scrutinise  the\n      evidence more particularly keeping in view the deficiencies, drawbacks\n      and infirmities pointed out in the evidence as a  whole  and  evaluate\n      them to find out whether it  is  against  the  general  tenor  of  the\n      evidence and whether the earlier evaluation of the evidence is  shaken\n      as to render it unworthy of belief.  Minor  discrepancies  on  trivial\n      matters not touching the core of the case, hypertechnical approach  by\n      taking sentences torn out of context here or there from the  evidence,\n      attaching  importance  to  some  technical  error  committed  by   the\n      investigating officer not going to the root of the  matter  would  not\n      ordinarily permit rejection of the evidence as a whole.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_724\">      16. If the court before  whom  the  witness  gives  evidence  had  the\n      opportunity to form  the  opinion  about  the  general  tenor  of  the\n      evidence given by the witness, the appellate court which had not  this\n      benefit will have to attach due weight to the appreciation of evidence\n      by the trial court and unless the reasons are weighty and  formidable,\n      it would not be proper for the appellate court to reject the  evidence\n      on the ground of variations or infirmities in the  matter  of  trivial\n      details. Minor omissions in the police statements are never considered\n      to be fatal. The statements given by the witnesses before  the  police\n      are meant to be brief statements and could not take place of  evidence\n      in the court. Small/Trivial omissions would not justify a  finding  by\n      court that the witnesses concerned are liars. The prosecution evidence\n      may suffer from inconsistencies here and discrepancies there, but that\n      is a shortcoming from which no criminal case is free. The  main  thing\n      to be seen is whether those inconsistencies go  to  the  root  of  the\n      matter or pertain to insignificant  aspects  thereof.  In  the  former\n      case,  the  defence  may  be  justified  in   seeking   advantage   of\n      incongruities obtaining in the evidence. In the  latter,  however,  no\n      such benefit may be available to it.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_725\">      17.  In  the  deposition  of  witnesses,  there  are   always   normal\n      discrepancies, howsoever  honest  and  truthful  they  may  be.  These\n      discrepancies are due to normal errors of observation,  normal  errors\n      of memory due to lapse of time, due to mental disposition,  shock  and\n      horror at the time of occurrence and threat to the  life.  It  is  not\n      unoften that improvements in earlier version are made at the trial  in\n      order to give a boost  to  the  prosecution  case,  albeit  foolishly.\n      Therefore, it is the duty of the court to separate falsehood from  the\n      truth. In sifting the evidence, the court has to attempt  to  separate\n      the chaff from the grains in every case and  this  attempt  cannot  be\n      abandoned on the ground that the case is baffling unless the  evidence\n      is  really  so  confusing  or  conflicting  that  the  process  cannot\n      reasonably be carried out. In the  light  of  these  principles,  this\n      Court will have to determine  whether  the  evidence  of  eyewitnesses\n      examined in this case proves the prosecution case.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_726\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1200711\" id=\"span_6\">277)  In <a href=\"/doc/1200711/\" id=\"a_614\">State of H.P. vs. Lekh Raj</a>, (2000) 1 SCC 247, it was observed:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1097\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1969692\" id=\"span_7\">“7. In support of the impugned judgment the learned counsel  appearing\n      for the respondents vainly attempted to point out  some  discrepancies\n      in  the  statement  of  the  prosecutrix  and  other   witnesses   for\n      discrediting  the  prosecution  version.   Discrepancy   has   to   be\n      distinguished  from  contradiction.  Whereas  contradiction   in   the\n      statement of the witness is fatal for the case, minor  discrepancy  or\n      variance in evidence will not make the  prosecution&#x27;s  case  doubtful.\n      The normal course of the human conduct would be that while narrating a\n      particular  incident  there  may  occur  minor   discrepancies,   such\n      discrepancies in law may render credential to the depositions. Parrot-\n      like statements are disfavoured by the courts.

I\n      made the necessary entries in my office record for  sending  the  said\n      Vans to Bombay to Shakll Hasham  after  purchasing&quot;the  same  for  the\n      parties told  by  him.  The  R.T.O.  Authority  at  Ujjain  had  given\n      registration Number MP-13-D-0385 to &quot;blue colour Maruti Van.  Today  I\n      am not remembering the engine number and chassis number  of  the  said\n      Maruti Van.”\n                                             (emphasis added)\n\nDeposition of Shakeel Suleman Hasham (PW-366)\n      He deposed regarding the purchase of the said Maruti Vans as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1110\">      “In the same month (February 1993) I had also arranged  for  one  blue\n      colour and another red colour Maruti Van  also  registered  at  Madhya\n      Pradesh for Suleman Lakdawala. The said vehicles  were  registered  at\n      Madhya Pradesh Indore in the name of the purchasers  given  to  me  by\n      Suleman Lakdawala. I had given the work of registration to one Kailash\n      Baheti of Indore. Both the said vans were insured by  Insurance  Agent\n      Rakesh Tiwari before giving the same to Suleman  Lakdawala.  Both  the\n      said vehicles had arrived from Indore. I had  sent  the  same  to  the\n      Petrol pump of Suleman and asked him to take  the  delivery  from  the\n      said drivers who had brought the said vehicles.  Accordingly  he  took\n      the delivery by making payment to the drivers.”\n\nThus, PW 366, in his deposition  confirms  that  he  had  asked  PW  342  to\narrange for two Maruti Vans (red and blue color  each)  in  February,  1993.\nThe deposition of PW-342 therefore corroborates with the deposition  of  PW-\n366 in material particulars that both the  vans  were  purchased  in  Madhya\nPradesh  and  the  blue  Maruti  Van  was  registered  in   Ujjain   bearing\nregistration number MP-13-D-0385. It is established  that  this  number  and\nthe blue Maruti van had been duly identified by PWs- 5, 6 and 13 in court.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_734\">286)  Further, the deposition of Mukhtar Ahmed (PW-281)  reveals  about  the\ncavity which was prepared by him in the said Maruti Van  at  the  behest  of\nMohd.

This further corroborates the  fact  that  it  is\nthe same vehicle which was used in the Mahim Causeway incident.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_735\">Training in handling of arms and ammunitions and explosives at Sandheri  and\nBorghat\n\nDeposition of Harish Chandra Keshav Pawar (PW-105).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_736\">287)  At the relevant time, PW-105 was studying  in  8th  standard  and  was\nresiding at Sandheri and is an eye-witness to the incident:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1111\">(i)   On 08.03.1993, at about 09:00 hrs, a special  event  occurred  on  the\n      eastern side hillock to village Sandheri;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1112\">(ii)  The said event was in connection with firing of guns;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1113\">(iii) 10-11 persons participated in the said firing.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1114\">(iv)  The card board sheets were placed by the side of hillock;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1115\">(v)   4-5 persons from the group of 8-10 persons were  firing  at  the  said\n      cardboards using gun;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1116\">(vi)  He knows some persons, viz., A-17, A-79 from the group  as  they  were\n      from Sandheri Village;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_737\">PW-105 is an eyewitness to the practice session  which  took  place  at  the\nhillocks of Sandheri Village.

Even  though  the\naforesaid eye-witnesses i.e., PWs-105 and 106 have  not  specifically  named\nthe appellant, their  confessional  statements  duly  corroborate  with  the\nconfessional statements of various co-accused that  training  in  fire  arms\nwas conducted at the  hillocks  of  Sandheri.   As  far  as  naming  of  the\nappellant is concerned, mostly, the co-accused  persons  <a href=\"/doc/173310636/\" id=\"a_624\">referred  to  above</a>\nhave stated to his participation in addition to his own confession.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_743\">289)  It is further contended on behalf of  the  appellant  that  it  is  an\nadmitted case that there were 3 accused persons by  name  of  Bashir,  since\nthe name is very common in Muslims,  so  there  is  bona  fide  doubt  about\nreference to the present appellant in the  confessional  statements  of  co-\naccused, viz., A-16, A-23, A-25, A-32, A-77 regarding his  participation  in\nthe  conspiratorial  meetings.    On   this   particular   contention,   the\nconfessions of A-23, A-32 and deposition of PW-2 are very  clear  about  the\npresence of the appellant in those meetings and  there  is  no  doubt  about\nreference to the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_744\">290)  It is also contended on behalf of the  appellant  that  since  he  has\nstated in his confessional statement that he was  arrested  6-7  days  after\nthe blasts, hence, the date of arrest should be 19/20.03.1993, but  actually\nhe has been shown to be arrested on 30.03.1993 so he was illegally  detained\nby the police.  The said  submission  is  baseless  and  misleading  as  the\ndefence has failed to substantiate this averment and no  document  has  been\nplaced on record to  show  that  after  the  arrest  when  the  accused  was\nproduced before the Court, he immediately made any such complaint about  his\nillegal detention by the police.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_745\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1277706\" id=\"span_16\">291)  Mr. Ponda further contended on behalf of the appellant that  the  Test\nIdentification Parade was improperly conducted and, hence, no  reliance  can\nbe placed on such evidence.  The materials  relied  on  by  the  prosecution\nshow that in the present  case,  the  TIP  was  validly  conducted  and  all\nnecessary precautions were ensured by the SEM.  Further, the  evidence  with\nregard to the TIP can only be used as a corroborative piece of evidence  and\nis a test to strengthen trustworthiness of the substantive evidence  of  the\nwitness before the Court.  In the  present  case,  all  the  witnesses  have\nidentified the appellant before the Court and even the SEM  on  this  aspect\nwithstood his cross examination.  Further, with regard  to  the  same,  this\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1277706/\" id=\"a_625\">Mulla vs. State of U.P.</a>, (2010) 3 SCC 508, observed as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1125\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"99578\" id=\"span_17\">“43. As was  observed  by  this  Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/99578/\" id=\"a_626\">Matru  v.  State  of  U.P.</a>\n      identification tests do not constitute substantive evidence. They  are\n      primarily meant for the purpose of helping  the  investigating  agency\n      with an assurance that their progress with the investigation into  the\n      offence is proceeding on the right lines. The identification can  only\n      be used as corroboration of the  statement  in  court.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"56524\" id=\"span_18\">(<a href=\"/doc/56524/\" id=\"a_627\">Vide  Santokh\n      Singh v.

The necessity for holding an identification parade can arise  only\n      when the accused persons are not previously known  to  the  witnesses.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_746\">      The whole idea of a test identification parade is that  witnesses  who\n      claim to have seen the culprits at  the  time  of  occurrence  are  to\n      identify them from the midst of other persons without any aid  or  any\n      other source. The test is done to check upon their veracity. In  other\n      words, the main object of holding an identification parade, during the\n      investigation stage, is to test the memory of the witnesses based upon\n      first impression and also to enable the prosecution to decide  whether\n      all or any of them could be cited as eyewitnesses of the crime.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_747\">292)  The  above  said  evidence  thus  substantiates  and  establishes  the\ncharges framed against the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_748\">Sentence:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1127\">293)   The  prosecution  submitted  that  the  appellant  was   given   full\nopportunity to defend himself on the question of quantum of  sentence.

(iv)     He  was  fully\nconscious that those arms and ammunitions and explosives  were  to  be  used\nfor carrying out terrorist acts in order to take revenge for the  demolition\nof Babri Masjid.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1168\">303)  Mr. Manish, learned counsel  for  the  appellant  contended  that  the\nappellant was merely a landing agent and he had nothing to do with the  said\nconspiratorial meeting at Dubai and that he had gone to Dubai only  to  meet\nhis relatives and was not aware about the contents of  the  bags  which  had\nlanded on the Shekhadi coast.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1169\">304)  On perusal of the abovesaid confession, it  is  established  that  the\nappellant played a key role in effecting and organizing landing of arms  and\nammunitions and explosive substances and was actively  involved  with  Tiger\nMemon’s illegal and nefarious activities on regular basis.   He  attended  a\nconspiratorial meeting with  Dawood  Ibrahim  and  Tiger  Memon  wherein  he\nagreed to arrange for landing of arms and ammunitions and  explosives  which\nwere to be used for committing terrorist acts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1170\">305)  It was also contended on behalf of  the  appellant  that  he  was  not\naware of the contents of the boxes/parcels for which the  said  landing  was\ndone at Shekhadi.  The fact that  the  appellant  had  knowledge  about  the\ncontents of the boxes/parcels is clear from his own  confession  wherein  he\nhas stated that he was present at the time when  rifles,  pistols,  bullets,\ndetonators, hand grenades  etc.  were  being  unloaded  from  the  boxes  at\nWaghani Tower and further that Tiger Memon  had  shown  him  a  pencil  like\nthing and told him that it was worth Rs. 25,000/- and it could even  explode\nOberoi Hotel.  From the above, it is very much clear that the appellant  was\nnot mere a landing agent.  It is thus established that he was a  conspirator\nwhose primary role was smooth landing of the said arms and  ammunitions  and\nexplosives.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1171\">Confessional Statements of co-accused:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1172\">306)  Apart from his own confession, the involvement of  the  appellant  has\nalso been disclosed in the confessional  statements  of  the  following  co-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_762\">accused.

Shakil requested me to book one red coloured Maruti  Van\n      in the name of Asif Darvesh resident of M.G. Road, Indore and  another\n      new Maruti Van of blue coloured  in  the  name  of  Shri  Kasam  Ahmed\n      residing at Indira Nagar, Ujjain.  He also requested  me  to  register\n      both the Maruti Van at Indore and send the same to  Bombay.   He  also\n      told me that the payments of the same would be made at Bombay  to  the\n      driver.  I quoted a price of Rs.1,69,000/- per  vehicle  inclusive  of\n      registration and transport charges.  I was having  red  colour  Maruti\n      Van brought by me from M/s Bhatia &amp; Company, Gurgaon, Haryana and blue\n      colour Maruti Van brought from Vipul Motors, Faridabad, Haryana, in my\n      stock.  I had  brought  both  the  said  vehicles  by  making  advance\n      payment.  After receipt of booking from Shakil Hasham for red and blue\n      coloured brand  new  Maruti  Vans,  I  informed  the  details  of  the\n      purchasers to M/s Bhatia Company and M/s Vipul Motors.  After  receipt\n      of the said letters and bills from both the said companies in the name\n      of purchasers who wanted red and blue Maruti Vans  I  sent  papers  of\n      both the Vans for registration to RTO.  The blue coloured  Maruti  Van\n      was registered in the name of Kasam Ahmed at  Ujjain  RTO.   The  blue\n      coloured Maruti Van could not be registered at Indore due to lack of E-\n      Form necessary for registration.  Thereafter, I  sent  both  the  said\n      Vans to Bombay to Shakil Hasham.  Shakil Hasham received the  delivery\n      and paid Rs.3,38,000/- to my drivers.  My drivers gave the said amount\n      to me.  I made the necessary entries in my office record  for  sending\n      the said Vans to Bombay to Shakil Hasham after purchasing the same for\n      the parties told by him.   The  RTO  Authority  at  Ujjain  had  given\n      registration Number MP-13-D-0385 to “blue coloured Maruti Van.   Today\n      I am not remembering the engine number and chassis number of the  said\n      Maruti Van.””\n\n\n\nDeposition of Shakeel Suleman Hasham (PW-366)\n      In his deposition, he deposed that he had asked PW-342 to arrange  for\ntwo Maruti Vans (red and blue colour) in  February,  1993.   Both  the  vans\nwere purchased in Madhya Pradesh and the blue Maruti Van was  registered  in\nUjjain with the registration number MP-13-D-0385.   PW-366  further  deposed\nas under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1341\">       “In the same month (February 1993) I had also arranged for  one  blue\n      coloured and another red  coloured  Maruti  Vans  also  registered  at\n      Madhya  Pradesh  for  Suleman  Lakdawala.  The  said   vehicles   were\n      registered at Madhya Pradesh Indore in  the  name  of  the  purchasers\n      given to me by Suleman Lakdawala. I had given the work of registration\n      to one Kailash baheti of Indore. Both the said vans  were  insured  by\n      Insurance Agent Rakesh  Tiwari  before  giving  the  same  to  Suleman\n      Lakdawala. Both the said vehicles had arrived from Indore. I had  sent\n      the same to the Petrol pump of Suleman  and  asked  him  to  take  the\n      delivery from the said drivers who had brought  the  delivery  of  the\n      said vehicles.  Accordingly he took the delivery by making payment  to\n      the drivers.”\n\nIt is relevant to note that this number and the said  blue  Maruti  Van  has\nbeen identified by PWs-5, 6 and 13  in  their  depositions  as  the  vehicle\nwhich was involved in the said incident at Fishermen’s  Colony.   Thus,  PW-\n342, therefore, corroborates the deposition of PW-366 in that both the  Vans\nwere purchased in Madhya Pradesh and the blue Maruti Van was  registered  in\nUjjain and was given registration number bearing MP-13-D-0385.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1342\">332)  Further, the deposition of Mukhtar Ahmed  (PW-281)  reveals  that  the\ncavity was prepared by him in the said Maruti Van at  the  behest  of  Mohd.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_863\">Shafi Jariwala (AA).

Even if the above  witnesses  have  not\nidentified that  does  not  cause  any  dent  on  the  prosecution  case  as\nsufficient evidence  has  been  placed  on  record  by  the  prosecution  to\nestablish the presence and participation of the appellant  at  Sandheri  and\nBorghat.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_866\">Juvenile Issue:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1343\">334)  It is contended on behalf of the appellant that he was 17 years and  3\nmonths old on the date of commission of offence and his case ought  to  have\nbeen dealt under the <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_735\">Juvenile Justice (Care &amp; Protection of  Children)  Act,\n2000</a> (in short ‘<a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_736\">JJ Act</a>’) and the provisions of TADA are inapplicable to  his\ncase  and  the  learned  Designated  Court  erred  in  negating   the   said\ncontention.

Undoubtedly,\nTADA applies to deal  with  an  extraordinary  situation  and  problems  and\nextreme measures to be resorted when it is not possible  for  the  State  to\ntackle the situation under the ordinary penal  law.   TADA  provides  for  a\nspecial machinery to combat the growing menace of terrorism in  the  country\nspecifically where accused  cannot  be  checked  and  controlled  under  the\nordinary law of the  land.   Disruptive  activities  have  been  defined  in\nclause 2(b) as the Act deals to prevent the menace of terrorism.   Terrorism\nmeans use of violence when its most  important  result  is  not  merely  the\nphysical and mental damage to the victim  but  the  prolonged  physiological\neffect it produces or has the potentiality of producing on the society as  a\nwhole.  Terrorism is generally an attempt to acquire or  maintain  power  or\ncontrolled by intimidation and causing fear and helplessness  in  the  minds\nof people at large or any section thereof  and  it  is  a  totally  abnormal\nphenomenon.  Terrorism is distinguishable from other forms  of  violence  as\nin the former, the deliberate and systematic use  of  coercive  intimidation\nis used.

This phrase refers to the  best  interest  of  the  public\nwithin the four corners of the statute.  In fact, it means  preservation  of\nproper balance between the Constitutional/Statutory rights of an  individual\nand rights of the people at large to have the law  enforced.  The  “ends  of\njustice” does not mean vague  and  indeterminate  notions  of  justice,  but\njustice according to the law of the land.

In fact, this provision gives the over-riding  effect  to  this\nAct over other statutes.  However, it reads  that  the  Act  would  override\n“anything contained in any other law for the  time  being  in  force”.   The\nquestion does arise as to whether the statutory provisions of <a href=\"/doc/148942/\" id=\"a_850\">JJ  Act</a>  would\nhave an over-riding effect over the provisions of TADA which left long  back\nand was admittedly not in force  on  22.8.2006.   Thus,  the  question  does\narise as what is the meaning of the law for the time being in  force.   This\nCourt has interpreted this phrase to include the law  in  existence  on  the\ndate of commencement of the Act having over-riding effect and the law  which\nmay be enacted in future during the  life  of  the  Act  having  over-riding\neffect.

There may be\n      death, injury, or destruction  of  property  or  even  deprivation  of\n      individual liberty in the process but the  extent  and  reach  of  the\n      intended terrorist activity travels beyond the effect of  an  ordinary\n      crime capable of being punished under the ordinary penal  law  of  the\n      land and its main objective is to overawe the  Government  or  disturb\n      the harmony of the society or &quot;terrorise&quot; people and the  society  and\n      not only those directly assaulted, with a view  to  disturb  the  even\n      tempo, peace and tranquility of the society and create a sense of fear\n      and insecurity.”\n\nTADA, thus, being an act enacted for  special  purposes,  as  stated  above,\nwill have precedence over any other act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1382\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1537019\" id=\"span_50\">383)  Applying the above to the facts of the present case, it is clear  that\nthe appellant from his conduct <a href=\"/doc/1537019/\" id=\"a_859\">referred to above</a> cannot by  any  stretch  of\nimagination qualify as a child in need of care and protection  as  the  acts\ncommitted by him are so grave and heinous  warranting  the  maximum  penalty\nbut the Designated Court after considering all  these  factors  awarded  him\nlesser punishment when the co-accused who  accompanied  him  to  Fishermen’s\ncolony and committed similar acts were awarded with the  maximum  punishment\nfor heinous acts committed by them along with co-accused.\nConclusion:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1383\">384)   Thus,  from  the  reading  of  the  entire  evidence  placed  by  the\nprosecution, it is established beyond doubt that:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1384\">(i)   The appellant took oath that he will take revenge against Hindus;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1385\">(ii)  The appellant received training in handling of arms and explosives  at\n      Sandheri and Borghat;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1386\">(iii) He attended conspiratorial meeting at  the  residence  of  Babloo  and\n      Mobina;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1387\">(iv)  He participated in filling of RDX and iron scraps in vehicles  in  the\n      intervening night of 11/12.03.1993 at Al-Hussaini Building;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1388\">(v)    He  along  with  other  co-accused  lobbed  hand-grenades  at   Mahim\n      Fishermen’s colony;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1389\">(vi)  He possessed 17 hand-grenades which were concealed  in  the  over-head\n      water tank of Room No. 27, Chawl No. 22,  Transit  Camp,  Bandra  (E),\n      Bombay which were recovered at his instance.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_907\">Upon a reading of the entire evidence, we hold that all the  charges  framed\nagainst him stand proved beyond any doubt.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_908\">Sentence:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1390\">385)  The appellant was given full opportunity to  defend  himself  on  the\nquestion of quantum  of  sentence.  The  appellant  filed  statement  dated\n07.12.2006 on the quantum of sentence which is Exhibit 3051.  The appellant\nprayed that the following factors, amongst others, may be considered  while\ndetermining his sentence:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1391\">(i)   His brothers were residing separately after marriage  and  his  mother\n      and two younger brothers were residing with him\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1392\">(ii)  At the time of his arrest, he was 17 years and 3 months old.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1393\">(iii) He was the sole bread winner of the family.

It was observed:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1399\">      “1215)     Thus considering gruesome results likely to  be  ensued  by\n      commission of acts and in fact having ensued and still A-32, 36, 39  &amp;\n      43 without any rhyme or justification or  even  without  any  sort  of\n      reason plausible or otherwise, committing such acts reveal  that  each\n      of them was coveted member of conspiracy, of which members had  become\n      blind for working out heinous plans hatched by them i.e.  the  one  in\n      which there existed no regard to the life  of  any  person,  not  even\n      remotely connected with any of them.  Needless to add  that  existence\n      of such persons would be eminently dangerous for the society  of  law-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_909\">      abiding persons.  It is difficult to perceive that such persons can be\n      reformed by any type of punishment.  However, as stated earlier having\n      due regard to age of A-43 and the same  to  some  extent  denoting  of\n      there being some chance of reforming him necessary concession will  be\n      required to be  given  to  him  while  awarding  the  sentence.   Thus\n      considering the gravity of acts committed by others i.e. A-32, 36 &amp; 39\n      and still granting him only the sentence of life by ignoring that  the\n      acts committed by him has not transcended more than the results ensued\n      due the grace of God and not because of  themselves  were  not  having\n      such an intent; would amount  to  ignoring  potential  danger  to  the\n      society from existence of such a person.  Needless to add  any  amount\n      of life sentence and/or fine would be  too  inadequate  for  punishing\n      element of criminality entertained by such accused person and so  also\n      the same would be too inadequate to assure the society at  large  that\n      the arms of law would be well protecting it.   All  the  said  factors\n      clearly warrant levying of extreme penalty for such persons.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_910\">      1216)      At any rate, the aforesaid discussion being mainly for  the\n      offence of conspiracy and so also the commission of terrorist acts  by\n      them and during the same considering all the factors relevant to  acts\n      a conclusion  has  been  flown  that  considering  the  repetition  of\n      commission of such acts by  each  of  them,  the  same  would  warrant\n      according extreme penalty as prescribed for relevant offence excepting\n      for A-43 for whom the same will be required to be given on  some  what\n      lower pedestal.  However, still  while  awarding  the  sentence  basic\n      principle on which this court has so far progressed that awarding  the\n      same on the basis of  criminality  entertained  by  concerned  accused\n      while committing the act will be required to be borne  in  mind  while\n      prescribing punishment for every distinct offence committed by each of\n      them.  The same is necessary  that  as  each  of  them  had  committed\n      terrorist acts  only  one  occasion  i.e.  lobbing  hand  grenades  at\n      Fishermen Colony.    Hence the punishment  would  be  required  to  be\n      awarded for other offences committed by  each  of  them  on  the  same\n      principles on which the same has been awarded to other accused.  Since\n      while sentencing the accused persons found guilty  for  offence  under\n      <a href=\"/doc/167770480/\" id=\"a_860\">section 5</a> of TADA no sentence has been awarded to accused  also  found\n      guilty for commission of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1934415/\" id=\"a_861\">Arms Act</a> for the same act, the\n      same criteria will be required to be followed for A-43  who  has  been\n      found guilty for commission for such offences.”\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_911\">387)  All the materials placed show that the appellant has knowingly and\nwillingly  participated  at  various  stages  of  the  conspiracy.

The identification of the appellant as the person who was  present\nin the Maruti Van around the time of the incident by eye  witnesses  further\nestablishes his involvement in the conspiracy.

According  to  him,  the  eye  witnesses  were  silent\nregarding the appellant’s participation in  landing  and  transportation  of\narms and ammunitions which landed  at  Shekhadi  on  03/04.02.1993  and,  as\nsuch, there is  no  material  on  record  in  the  form  of  eye  witnesses’\ntestimony.  Likewise, there  is  no  mention  by  any  of  the  persons  who\nattended the meeting at the residence of Shakeel about the appellant  having\nparticipated in the said meeting, hence, the prosecution case has  not  been\nsubstantiated.  He further pointed out  that  the  approver’s  testimony  is\nsilent about the presence of the appellant in the meeting at  the  residence\nof Mobina and Babloo and with respect to filling of RDX in the vehicles.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1498\">405)  The abovesaid evidence establish  that  the  appellant  (A-57)  was  a\nmember of the conspiracy which resulted in the blasts and  acts  which  took\nplace in Bombay on 12.03.1993.  He played an active role in the  conspiracy.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_962\">The involvement of the appellant in various aspects of  the  conspiracy  can\nbe summarized below:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1499\">(i)   The landing of arms and ammunitions and explosives at Shekhadi;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1500\">(ii)  The transportation of arms and ammunitions and  explosives  which  had\n      landed at Shekhadi;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1501\">(iii) He took training in handling weapons and explosives at Sandheri;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1502\">(iv)  He participated in the survey/reconnaissance of the  Bombay  Municipal\n      Corporation building conducted on 09.03.1993;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1503\">(v)   He attended conspiratorial meetings that took  place  to  further  the\n      common motives of the conspirators and to decide the plan of action to\n      meet the ends of the conspiracy;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1504\">406)  It is thus established that the appellant played  a  significant  role\nin the conspiracy and knew about the  intention  of  the  conspirators  well\nbefore the incidents took place. The appellant shared  the  motive  and  the\nintention along with the other conspirators and  was  committed  to  achieve\nthe ultimate goal of the conspiracy.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1505\">Sentence:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1506\">407)   According  to  the  prosecution,  the  appellant   was   given   full\nopportunity to defend himself on the question of quantum  of  sentence.  His\nstatement was recorded on 10.10.2006 in which he prayed that  the  following\nfactors, amongst others, may be considered while determining his sentence:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1507\">(i)   He had been in custody for 13 years since  his  arrest  in  March,\n      1993;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1508\">(ii)  After the demolition of the Babri Masjid, riots had ensued and  he\n      shifted to his father’s residence;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1509\">(iii) Thereafter, the locality of Behrampada  was  attacked  and  houses\n      were burnt and because of the same, his wife and  children  had  to\n      shift to Alunednagar;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1510\">(iv)  After his savings were exhausted, he came to Bombay on 9th  March,\n      1993 for taking money from his friend Javed Chikna;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1511\">(v)   He worked with Javed Chikna and could not run away  as  he  needed\n      money;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1512\">(vi)  He had confessed before the police and told them about  everything\n      which he had seen;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1513\">(vii) The main advocate, defending him in the case, left  at  a  crucial\n      juncture;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1514\">(viii)      He only has his wife and children, who are totally dependent\n      on him.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1515\">408)  A perusal of the judgment of the Designated Court shows  that  all\nthe above factors have been duly considered by the Designated Judge.  As\nrightly pointed out by the prosecution, the  aforesaid  contentions  are\ndevoid of any merit having regard to the fact that the appellant had the\nknowledge  that  the  smuggled  goods  had  sufficient   potential   for\ncommission of terrorist acts,  owing  to  the  fact  that  he  had  also\nacquired  training  in  handling  sophisticated  arms  and  ammunitions.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_963\">Further, it was contended that the appellant was forced by circumstances\nto work with Javed Chikna, is not tenable as  despite  being  needy  and\nrequiring money at the time of first landing, he got to  know  that  the\nfirst landing was of arms and  ammunitions  and  explosives  which  were\ncapable of causing mass destruction, he chose to remain  silent  instead\nof approaching the police or taking recourse to law. Despite  all  this,\nhe participated in the second landing at Shekhadi, and moreover, he went\nto Sandheri and took  training  in  handling  of  arms,  ammunition  and\nexplosives.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_964\">409)  The appellant attended crucial conspiratorial  meetings  also.  On\nthe night of 11/12.03.1993, he participated in the  filling  of  RDX  in\nvehicles for the preparation of vehicle bombs. He  also  introduced  Gul\nMohmed (A-77) in the conspiracy and got him recruited  for  training  in\nhandling of  arms  and  ammunitions  and  explosives  at  Pakistan.  The\nappellant also undertook reconnaissance of the B.M.C. building  and  the\nStock Exchange building along with A-44, PW-2, Javed  Chikna  and  Tiger\nMemon, which were marked as targets for planting bombs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_965\">410)  The appellant’s guilt is further established by the fact  revealed\nin his confession that after the blasts, he  left  Bombay  and  went  to\nAhmednagar. This establishes that he knew that whatever the conspirators\nhad done was wrong and contrary to law.      Thus,  his  claim  that  he\ndisassociated himself at the time of the first landing at  Shekhadi  has\nnot been made out in the light of other evidence on record. In fact,  he\nwas engaged in the commission of acts furthering the object  of  such  a\nheinous conspiracy.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_966\">411)  The appellant participated in the acts mentioned  above  willingly\nand with complete knowledge.  He knew that the arms and ammunitions, RDX\nand hand grenades, which were smuggled into India at Shekhadi  would  be\nused for committing terrorist acts. It is clearly established  from  his\nconfession that Tiger Memon had told his associates  that  the  smuggled\narms were to be used against Hindus to take revenge for  the  demolition\nof Babri Masjid and that they  would  be  used  for  causing  blasts  in\nBombay.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_967\">412)  In the light of  the  above,  we  hold  that  the  conviction  and\nsentence awarded by the Designated Court to the appellant  is  justified\nand there is no ground for interference.  Consequently,  the  appeal  is\naccordingly dismissed.</p><pre id=\"pre_8\">\n                    Criminal Appeal Nos. 933-936 of 2008\n\n\nNiyaz Mohammed @ Aslam Iqbal\nAhmed Shaikh (A-98)                          …..Appellant(s)\n\n      vs.\n\nThe State of Maharashtra,\nthrough CBI-STF, Mumbai                         ….Respondent(s)\n\n\n\n\n                                 **********\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_968\">413) Mr. Aabad Ponda, learned counsel  for  the  appellant  (A-98)  and  Mr.\nMukul Gupta, learned senior counsel duly assisted by Mr.  Satyakam,  learned\ncounsel for the respondent-CBI.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_969\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"106471\" id=\"span_52\">414)  The abovesaid appeals are directed  against  the  final  judgment  and\norder  of  conviction  and  sentence   dated   03.10.2006   and   01.06.2007\nrespectively, whereby the appellant (A-98) has been convicted and  sentenced\nto rigorous imprisonment (RI) for life by the Designated  Court  under  TADA\nfor the <a href=\"/doc/106471/\" id=\"a_910\">Bombay Bomb Blast</a> Case, Greater Bombay in B.B.C.

X-648\nclearly shows that he  left  Bombay  on  08.02.1993  and  reached  Dubai  on\n09.02.1993 and left Dubai on the  same  date  and  entered  Dubai  again  on\n27.02.1993 and left Dubai  finally  on  02.03.1993  and  entered  Bombay  on\n03.03.1993. The said entries further corroborate  with  the  confessions  of\nvarious accused persons that they did not have to go  through  any  checking\nat the Airport in Pakistan. It is further submitted  that  it  was  not  the\ncase of the  appellant  before  the  trial  Court  that  he  was  elsewhere.\nTherefore, the evidence on record clearly establishes the  charge  of  going\nto Pakistan for training against the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_994\">429)  The aforesaid evidence clearly  establish  that  the  appellant  along\nwith other co-conspirators was given the said training to  equip  themselves\nto commit terrorist acts in Bombay  and,  therefore,  he  has  rightly  been\nconvicted under <a href=\"/doc/105771932/\" id=\"a_949\">Section 3(3)</a> of  TADA mentioned at head secondly.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_995\">430)  Thus, in view of the entire evidence enumerated above,  we  hold  that\nthe appellant was actively involved in the conspiracy  to  cause  blasts  in\nBombay and in consequence of the said  involvement,  he  has  committed  the\noffences for which he has been charged.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_996\">Sentence\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_997\">431)  Coming to the sentence, though there is no need to show  any  leniency\nin respect of the act  involved  and  as  proved  by  the  prosecution,  the\nfollowing facts are relevant for awarding the appropriate sentence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_998\">432)   Learned counsel  for  the  appellant  pointed  out  that  though  the\nappellant was sentenced to RI for life, he had already served  19  years  in\njail.  He also pointed out  that  the  appellant  is  suffering  from  neuro\nproblem and also  had  backache  problem  for  the  last  five  years.   The\nappellant’s mother is also suffering from heart ailment, diabetes and  blood\npressure.  He further pointed out that the appellant  had  been  in  custody\nsince his arrest.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_999\">433)  On the other hand, learned counsel appearing for the CBI  pointed  out\nthat there is no need to show any leniency since after realizing  explosions\nthat took place in Bombay on 12.03.1993, the  appellant  had  absconded  and\nremained away from the clutches of law until he was arrested by the  police.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1000\">434)  It is true that the Designated  Judge  considered  all  these  aspects\nwhile awarding sentence.  There is no dispute  about  his  participation  in\nthe training and the evidence disclosed  that  he  participated  in  various\nconspiratorial meetings in order  to  chalk  out  the  plan  for  committing\nterrorist acts and in pursuance of the same, he did  reconnaissance  of  the\nBMC Building alongwith other co-conspirators.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_1001\">435)  In view of the acceptable materials placed by the prosecution,  relied\non by the Special Judge and  the  reasoning  appended  therewith,  we  fully\nagree with the same,  consequently,  the  appeals  filed  by  the  appellant\nherein (A-98) are dismissed.</p><pre id=\"pre_9\">\n                    Criminal Appeal Nos. 933-936 of 2008\n\nParvez Mohammed Parvez\nZulfikar Qureshi (A-100)                          ...

With\nregard to the above, in the light of the evidence in the  form  of  his  own\nconfession and confessional statement of co-accused persons,  it  cannot  be\nclaimed  that  he  merely  witnessed  the  incident  when  his  presence  is\nevidently proved by acceptable materials.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1667\">450)  On the other hand,  learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the  CBI\npointed out that  there  is  no  need  to  show  any  leniency  since  after\nrealizing explosions that had taken  place  in  Bombay  on  12.03.1993,  the\nappellant (A-100) had absconded and remained away from the clutches  of  law\nuntil he was arrested by the police.
