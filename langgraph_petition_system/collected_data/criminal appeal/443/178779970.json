In Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011, on behalf\nof appellant Santosh @ Bhure, it was argued that,\nfirstly, there is no documentary evidence that Santosh\nwas tenant of the apartment; secondly, no motive for\nmurder is proved; thirdly, presence of Santosh in that\napartment at the relevant time is not proved; and,\nfourthly, when the police team visited the spot, a plate,\nglass, steel bowl, quarter bottle of whisky, packet of\nsalted snacks mixtures were found, yet the FSL Report\nis silent whether fingerprints of the appellant was\nfound on those articles, which suggests that someone\nelse committed the crime.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">12.      In respect of disclosure statement leading to\ndiscovery/recovery of blood-stained clothes, it was\nargued that, firstly, as alleged by the prosecution,\nthere were two disclosure statements, the first\nresulted in no discovery, therefore, in absence of\nevidence as to what transpired between the first and\nthe second disclosure, the creditworthiness of the\nsecond disclosure as the basis of discovery of the place\nof concealment is seriously dented. More so, when that\nplace is rooftop of the same building where the murder\ntook place 13 days ago. Moreover, from the statement\nof police witnesses, it appears that identical disclosure\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.          Page 13 of 79</span>\n\fstatements were made by the two accused almost\nsimultaneously, therefore, in absence of clear and\nsatisfactory evidence as to whose disclosure was made\nfirst, not much value could be attached to such a\ndisclosure and the consequential recovery.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">13.      It was next argued that assuming the blood-\nstained clothes were recovered on 25.09.2000, there\nexisted no admissible evidence to prove that those\nclothes were of the accused. The statement of Santosh\n@ Bhure, one of the two accused, made to the police\nin respect thereof is not admissible in evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">14.      In addition to the above, learned counsel for\nthe appellant Santosh @ Bhure strenuously argued\nthat mere presence of a dead body in the apartment of\nan accused, which is accessible to others and is not\nunder lock and key or exclusive control of the accused,\nby itself is not sufficient to infer that the accused has\ncommitted the crime, particularly, when there is no\nproven motive for the crime and there is no evidence\nof the deceased being last seen alive in the company\nof the accused. Moreover, there is no evidence in\nrespect of presence of Santosh in the apartment or in\nthe vicinity around the probable time of occurrence.\nRather, PW4 stated that on 11.09.2000 when he\nvisited the apartment between noon and 1 p.m., he\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.          Page 14 of 79</span>\n\fsaw the deceased there but could not notice Santosh\n@ Bhure there, rather, the deceased told him that\nSantosh @ Bhure was not at home.                   Further, the\npresence of whisky bottle, snacks pouches, etc. at the\nspot suggested that the deceased had some person to\ngive him company. However, the prosecution evidence\ncould not disclose as to whose finger prints were found\non those articles. Thus, the prosecution evidence\nleaves a large gap in the chain of circumstances\nthereby failing to rule out third person’s hand in the\ncrime. Hence, the benefit of doubt must enure to the\nappellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">15.      Lastly, according to him, the High Court erred\nin observing that Santosh by secreting himself since\nthe   date     of   occurrence        i.e.   11/12.09.2000     till\n23.09.2000 reflected a guilty mind. It was submitted\nthat the said observation has no basis, firstly, because\nthe presence of appellant in the apartment or\nthereabout on 11.09.2000, or any time thereafter, till\nrecovery of dead body is not proved and, secondly,\nthere is an explanation of Santosh that when\ninformation about the crime was received at his native\nplace, his parents requested him to go to Delhi to\nconfirm the information. This explanation fits in with\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.                 Page 15 of 79</span>\n\fthe circumstance that he surrendered in Court on\n23.09.2000.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">16.      Per contra, on behalf of the State, it was\nargued that it is proved beyond doubt that the\napartment where the body was found was in the\ntenancy of Santosh; that there was recovery of blood-\nstained clothes at the pointing out and on the basis of\ndisclosure made by Santosh; the blood on the said\nclothes was of same group as on the clothes worn by\nthe deceased at the time of his death; that Santosh,\ndespite being tenant, gave no information to the police\nregarding the murder rather, remained absconding till\n23.09.2000 even though the police had raided his\nnative    place     on    20.09.2000;   and   there   is   no\nexplanation from Santosh as to how dead body of the\ndeceased was present in his apartment. Rather, a false\ncase of denial was set up which is reflective of his\nguilty mind. Hence, the chain of incriminating\ncircumstances is complete, conclusively pointing\ntowards the guilt of the accused. Therefore, the appeal\nof Santosh be dismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_38\">Submissions in Criminal Appeal No.576 of 2011\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1626264\" id=\"span_24\">17.

Thus, as it is proved that the\n    suicide letter was recovered from a pocket of the\n    trouser which the deceased was wearing at the time of\n    his death, and there is recovery of knife/dagger at the\n    instance of Neeraj, which, according to the doctor,\n    could have caused injuries as were found on the body\n    of the deceased, it stood proved beyond reasonable\n\n3 AIR 1961 SC 1808\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">    Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.

With regard to recovery of trousers, it was\nsubmitted that the said recovery is not at the instance\nof Neeraj therefore it has no evidentiary value qua him.\nAnd the statement of co-accused Santosh @ Bhure\nthat one of the two trousers was of Neeraj is not\nadmissible in evidence.

We have considered the rival submissions and\nperused the record. Before we proceed further, it\nwould be apposite to remind ourselves that this is a\ncase where there is no eyewitness account of the\nmurder. Prosecution seeks to bring home the charge\nlevelled on the accused by relying on certain\ncircumstances. As to when on strength of evidence\ncircumstantial in nature conviction can be lawfully\nsustained, the law is well settled — the circumstances\nfrom which the conclusion of guilt is to be drawn\nshould, in the first instance, be fully established; these\ncircumstances should be of a definite tendency\nunerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused;\nthe circumstances taken cumulatively should form a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.

Further, the circumstances from which the\n      conclusion of guilt is to be drawn should be fully\n      established meaning thereby that they ‘must’ or\n      ‘should’ and not ‘may be’ established (See: <a href=\"/doc/13149785/\" id=\"a_20\">Sharad\n      Birdhichand Sarda v.

The information\nabout presence of dead body in that apartment came\nat about 10.40 a.m. on 12.09.2000. Obviously, in\nabsence of an eyewitness account of the murder, the\nprosecution cannot disclose the exact time of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.

What is interesting is\nthat during investigation PW3 had disclosed to the\npolice that he noticed Santosh @ Bhure leaving the\nbuilding with a Gathri (a bag made of cloth) at about\n4.00 p.m. on 11.09.2000, whereas PW4, during\ninvestigation, stated that he saw the deceased playing\ncards and having liquor with the two accused at or\nabout 9.00 p.m. on 11.09.2000. However, during their\ndeposition in court neither PW3 nor PW4 disclosed\nabout the presence of Santosh @ Bhure in or around\nthat apartment/building at any time on 11.09.2000 or\nafter, till recovery of dead body of the deceased.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">Therefore, they were declared hostile.

Not only that,\nPW3 resiled from his previous statement, made during\ninvestigation, that, at or about noon of 11.09.2000,\nSantosh @ Bhure had come to his grocery shop to\npurchase snacks etc.            Thus, from the statement of\nPW3, it is not at all established that the appellant\nSantosh @ Bhure was present in the house on\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.

Rather, from the deposition of PW3 an\nimportant circumstance emerges, which is, that the\napartment from where the body was retrieved on\n12.09.2000 was not found locked or shut. PW3’s\ndeposition is that on 12.09.2000 while he was at his\ngrocery shop, located on the ground floor of that\nbuilding, a washer woman informed him that blood\nwas lying on the second floor of the building. On\ngetting this information, he went upstairs to notice\nthat a person is lying dead on a folding cot with blood\non the floor. There is no statement of PW3 or of any\nother witness that door of that apartment was shut or\nlocked and had to be broke open. This assumes\nimportance in the context of PW4’s deposition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">35.      PW4 is a tenant of the first floor of that\nbuilding. As per his testimony, on 11.09.2000,\nbetween noon and 1.00 p.m., when he visited the\napartment of Santosh @ Bhure he found Hari Shankar\n(the deceased) present there in a drunken condition.\nPW4 does not state that Santosh was also present\nthere. Rather, according to PW4, when he enquired\nfrom Hari Shankar the whereabouts of Santosh, he\nwas informed that Santosh is not there. No doubt,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.        Page 31 of 79</span>\n\fPW4 was declared hostile and cross examined but,\nduring cross examination, he denied making a\nstatement that in the night of 11.09.2000, at about\n9.00 p.m., he had noticed Hari Shankar playing cards\nwith Neeraj and Santosh in that apartment.           What\nemerges from PW4’s testimony is that Hari Shankar\nwas noticed alone in that apartment on 11.09.2000\nbetween noon and 1.00 p.m. In short, the prosecution\nhas failed to demonstrate (a) that the apartment was\nlocked or in exclusive control of Santosh @ Bhure and\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">(b) that the deceased was in the company of Santosh\nor Neeraj on 11.09.2000 or any time thereafter, till\nrecovery of the body of the deceased. The prosecution\nhas also not proved that on 11.09.2000 or any time\nthereafter, till recovery of the body of the deceased, the\ntwo accused were seen in the vicinity of that\napartment or building from where the dead body was\nretrieved on 12.09.2000.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">36.      In light of the discussion above, we are of the\nview that though the prosecution has succeeded in\nproving that the apartment where body of the\ndeceased was found stood in the tenancy of Santosh\nbut it failed to lead any evidence that the two accused,\nor any one of them, were present there, or in the\nvicinity, either on 11.09.2000 or any time thereafter,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.          Page 32 of 79</span>\n\ftill recovery of the dead body. In other words, the\nprosecution miserably failed to show the presence of\nthe accused around the probable time of murder.\nFurther, the prosecution led no evidence to establish\nthat the concerned apartment was under lock and key\nor exclusive control of either Santosh or Neeraj. Even\nthe theory of exclusive possession of Santosh over that\napartment is dented by the statement of PW4 that till\na week before the incident one Hari Ram used to live\nin that apartment with Santosh @ Bhure. There is also\nno evidence of the prosecution to show that the\nconcerned apartment had a separate stair case\naccessible to Santosh and no one else. For all the\nreasons above, though we hold that tenancy of the\nconcerned apartment was proved to be with Santosh\nbut neither his nor Neeraj’s presence in that\napartment, around the relevant time, is proved by any\nevidence. It is also not proved that Santosh was in\nexclusive possession or control of that apartment.\nRather, from the testimony of PW4 it appears that one\nHari Ram was residing there with Santosh though, he\nhad left the place a week before the incident. As to\nwhether the deceased Hari Shankar came there after\nHari Om had left or was residing there since before, is\nnot clear from the prosecution evidence. In fact there\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.        Page 33 of 79</span>\n\fis no evidence - (a) as to when the deceased came into\nthat apartment and (b) in what capacity he was\nresiding there. In light of the discussion above and in\nthe facts of the case, in our considered view, the mere\npresence of the dead body in the apartment let out to\nSantosh is not such a clinching circumstance which,\non its own, could sustain Santosh’s conviction with\nthe aid of <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_35\">section 106</a> of the IEA, 1872 by shifting the\nonus     on    him      to   explain   as   to   under    what\ncircumstances the dead body with multiple injuries\nwas found there.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">Circumstance (b) and (c) — Re: Cause of death and\nplace of murder\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">37.      As regards death of Hari Shanker being\nhomicidal and a consequence of multiple injuries\ncaused by a sharp edged weapon, no serious challenge\nis there to the findings returned by the courts below.\nHence, we accept the finding that death was homicidal\nand a consequence of injuries caused by use of sharp-\nedged weapon. Likewise, there is no challenge to the\nfinding that blood etc. was lifted from the apartment\nthereby confirming that murder took place there.\nHowever, in addition to blood or blood-stained cot/\nlinen there were whisky bottle, empty packets/\npouches of salted snacks, cigarette butts, etc. lifted\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.

Insofar as recovery of suicide letter from a\npocket of the trouser which the deceased was wearing\nat the time of his death is concerned, the same has\nbeen proved by the testimonies of Investigating Officer\nJ.L. Meena (PW28) and SI Rajesh (PW15) and in proof\nthereof, the seizure memorandum and the suicide\nletter were produced and exhibited. No doubt PW3, a\npublic witness, signatory to the seizure memorandum,\nhas denied seizure in his presence but the two courts\nbelow, relying on the testimony of police witnesses,\nhave concurrently found recovery of the suicide letter\nproved. To us there appears no reason to interfere with\nthe said finding. However, the real issue is whether it\nwas duly proved that the suicide letter was written by\nNeeraj.

The prosecution relied on two\npieces of evidence to prove that the suicide letter was\nwritten by Neeraj.

In that case, according to the prosecution,\nthe specimen writing of the accused was taken under\ndirection of Tehsildar-Executive Magistrate and based\non comparison of that specimen with the disputed\nransom letter, the expert opined that writing on the\nransom letter was of the accused.

In   the     instant      case,   according   to   the\nprosecution evidence, the specimen signatures and\nhandwritings        of    Neeraj       were    obtained    during\ninvestigation.

The\nonly    defence       taken    is     that   the    specimens      of\nhandwriting        and     signature         were   obtained      by\ncompulsion. As we have already found that such\nobjection       was      unsustainable          therefore,     once\ngenuineness of the specimens was not disputed, the\nspecimens were available for comparison and were\nrightfully used for obtaining expert report.

More so, when the defence filed no\napplication      to    summon         the     expert   for   cross-\nexamination.

It\n         is indeed true that by nature and habit, over a\n         period of time, each individual develops certain\n         traits which give a distinct character to his\n         writings making it possible to identify the\n         author but it must at the same time be realised\n         that since handwriting experts are generally\n         engaged by one of the contesting parties they,\n         consciously or unconsciously, tend to lean in\n         favour of an opinion which is helpful to the\n         party engaging him. That is why we come\n         across cases of conflicting opinions given by two\n         handwriting experts engaged by opposite\n         parties. It is, therefore, necessary to exercise\n         extra care and caution in evaluating their\n         opinion before accepting the same. So\n         courts have as a rule of prudence refused to\n         place implicit faith on the opinion evidence\n         of a handwriting expert. Normally courts\n         have considered it dangerous to base a\n         conviction solely on the testimony of a\n         handwriting expert because such evidence is\n         not regarded as conclusive. Since such\n         opinion evidence cannot take the place of\n         substantive evidence, courts have, as a rule\n         of prudence, looked for corroboration before\n         acting on such evidence. True it is, there is\n         no rule of law that the evidence of a\n         handwriting expert cannot be acted upon\n         unless substantially corroborated but courts\n         have been slow in placing implicit reliance\n         on such opinion evidence, without more,\n         because of the imperfect nature of the\n         science of identification of handwriting and\n         its accepted fallibility. …”\n                                     (Emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.

The underlying principle deducible from the\nobservations extracted above is that though it is not\nimpermissible to base a finding with regard to\nauthorship of a document solely on the opinion of a\nhandwriting expert but, as a rule of prudence, because\nof imperfect nature of the science of identification of\nhandwriting and its accepted fallibility, such opinion\nhas to be relied with caution and may be accepted if,\non its own assessment, the Court is satisfied that the\ninternal     and     external     evidence   relating   to   the\ndocument in question supports the opinion of the\nexpert and it is safe to accept his opinion.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_105\">66.      In the instant case, with regard to authorship\nof the suicide letter, the Trial Court though returned a\nfinding in favour of the prosecution by relying solely\non the expert report but did not record its satisfaction\nhaving regard to its own observations with respect to\nthe admitted and disputed writings. It also did not\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.

It be noted that <a href=\"/doc/770022/\" id=\"a_92\">section 73</a> of the\nIEA, 1872 enables a Court to compare the words or\nfigures written by a person present in Court with any\nwords or figures alleged to have been written by such\nperson.     The     Trial    Court          therefore   could    have\nundertaken such an exercise. But, in the instant case,\nthere appears no such exercise undertaken by the\nTrial Court. What is important is that in the instant\ncase there is no witness statement identifying the\nhandwriting of Neeraj or disclosing that Neeraj wrote\nthe suicide letter in his presence. There is also no\nevidence to explain the relevance of the contents of the\nsuicide letter. Interestingly, the suicide letter indicts\none Chhote Porwal. As to why such indictment was\nmade; whether it was with reference to some other\nevent contemplated, the prosecution evidence is silent.\nBesides that, there is no evidence to show that the\ninvestigating officer queried person(s) conversant with\nthe handwriting of the deceased to rule out possibility\nof the suicide letter being in the writing of the deceased\nhimself. In our view, such an exercise was necessary\nto lend assurance to the prosecution story of the\nsuicide letter being written by Neeraj to mask the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.                      Page 57 of 79</span>\n\fmurder, because, firstly, the death on its face was not\nsuicidal, and, secondly, it could have ruled out\npossibility of it being written in contemplation of some\nother event.       Seen in that light, barring the expert\nreport, there exists no internal or external evidence to\nlend assurance to the prosecution story that the\nsuicide letter was written by Neeraj.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\">67.      In addition to the above, we find it quite\ndifficult to accept as to why Neeraj would leave a\nsuicide letter written by him in a pocket of the trouser\nworn by the deceased, particularly, when the injuries\neven to a layman were homicidal. Notably, there were\neight ante-mortem injuries found on the body of the\ndeceased. In paragraph 72 of Trial Court’s judgment\nthe injuries have been extracted.

In light of the discussion above, taking into\naccount that Neeraj has denied the incriminating\ncircumstance of writing the suicide letter and no\ninternal or external evidence, save the expert report,\nsupports the writing of suicide letter by Neeraj, we are\nof the considered view that though the expert evidence\nwas admissible as an opinion on the writing in the\nsuicide letter but, on overall assessment of the\nevidence led by the prosecution, solely on its basis, it\nwould be extremely unsafe to hold that the suicide\nletter retrieved from the trouser of the deceased was\nwritten by Neeraj.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">Circumstance (e) — Re: The two accused were not\ntraceable from 12.09.2000 till 23.09.2000\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_116\">70.      The fact that the two accused could be\napprehended on 23.09.2000 when they had appeared\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.         Page 60 of 79</span>\n\fto surrender in connection with the case is proved by\nthe police witnesses and there is no good reason to\ndoubt their testimony. Moreover, the accused neither\nled evidence nor tendered explanation in respect of\nany other date or time or place of their arrest or\nsurrender. In his statement, under Section 313 of the\nCode, Santosh had disclosed that he was informed\nabout     some      occurrence        in   Delhi,   therefore,    to\nascertain the same, he came to Delhi. Insofar as Neeraj\nis concerned, the circumstance that he was arrested\non 23.09.2000 has not even been put to him while\nrecording his statement under Section 313 of the\nCode. Rather, the arrest of co-accused Santosh from\ncourt premises was put to him. However, what is\nsurprising is that while recording statement of the two\naccused under Section 313 of the Code, none of them\nwas confronted with any incriminating circumstance\nsuggestive of they having secreted themselves to evade\narrest. Moreover, the only evidence led by the\nprosecution in that regard was that an effort was made\nto trace them out and in that connection, a visit to\ntheir native place (i.e. at Etawah) was made on\n20.09.2000        where      they     were    not   found.     But,\nunfortunately, the statement that the police visited\ntheir native place on 20.09.2000 was not even put to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.

In     these\n    circumstances, it is difficult for us to hold with a\n    degree of certainty that they were guilty, therefore they\n    secreted themselves. As regards inference from non-\n    reporting of the crime by Santosh, what goes in his\n    favour is that there is no clear evidence to show that\n    he was present in the apartment at the relevant time.\n    Even if he had been a tenant of that apartment, he\n    could always be present elsewhere for a few days.\n    Here, it was just a matter of few hours, inasmuch as,\n    murder took place between afternoon of 11.09.2000\n    and morning of 12.09.2000. Body was found at about\n    10.40 a.m. on 12.09.2000. Once the body was found\n    and      police   entered      the    scene,    after     the    first\n    information report, even if Santosh had been away and\n    innocent, his instinct of self-preservation would have\n    got the better of him to evade arrest till better counsel\n    prevailed upon him to surrender. Such conduct by\n    itself is not reflective of a guilty mind. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"99578\" id=\"span_95\">In Matru alias\n    <a href=\"/doc/99578/\" id=\"a_93\">Girish Chandra v.

Seen in that light, a confusing picture emerges\nfrom the statement of PW15, that is, whether it was\nNeeraj who first disclosed the spot from where blood-\nstained clothes were recovered or it was Santosh who\ndisclosed it first. What is most damaging to the\nprosecution is PW15’s statement that he wrote the\ndisclosure statements on instructions of Inspector J.L.\nMeena (PW28) and not on basis of what he heard the\naccused state. In our view, this creates a serious\npossibility of the disclosure evidence being fabricated\nfor using it against both the accused which seriously\ndents its credibility thereby rendering it unworthy of\nacceptance. More so, when the first disclosure\nresulted in no discovery.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_124\">75.

And since we have already\ndoubted the disclosure statements set up by the police\nwitnesses, it would be unsafe to place reliance on their\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.

Because, in such a\nscenario, it would be logical to expect that the police\nwould have left no nook and corner of that building\nunscanned.

As regards recovery of knife at the instance of\nNeeraj, the same has been denied by Neeraj and there\nappears no independent witness to support it,\ninasmuch as PW13, touted as a public witness, turned\nout to be a special police officer and insofar as the\nother police witnesses are concerned, we have already\ndoubted their conduct in setting up disclosure\nstatements. Moreover, the place from where recovery\nis made is accessible to all and sundry. Otherwise\nalso, its incriminating value is extremely limited\nbecause,      firstly,   there        is   no   forensic   evidence\nconnecting the knife with the crime; secondly, the\nknife is a common knife which could easily be\navailable; thirdly, the wounds found on the body of the\ndeceased were of different dimensions giving rise to\npossibility of use of more weapon than one; and,\nfourthly, the entire exercise of recovery does not\ninspire our confidence, particularly, because the first\nattempt to recover had failed.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.

For all the reasons above, we hold that the\ncircumstances with regard to making of disclosure\nstatements and consequential discoveries/recoveries\nwere not proved beyond reasonable doubt. In our view,\nthe two courts below have not properly appreciated\nand    scrutinised       the    evidences,   particularly   the\ntestimony of PW15, as noticed and analysed above, to\ntest whether the said circumstances were proved\nbeyond reasonable doubt. Hence, findings to the\ncontrary returned by the two courts below are set\naside. As a result thereof, the forensic report with\nregard to presence of human blood on the clothes\nrecovered has no incriminating value qua the two\naccused.

As     discussed        above,   the   incriminating\ncircumstance that stood proved beyond reasonable\ndoubt as against Santosh was that the deceased had\ndied a homicidal death in the flat/apartment which\nstood in his tenancy. Insofar as Neeraj is concerned\nthere is no admissible evidence connecting him with\neither Santosh or the deceased. There is also no\nadmissible evidence to show that Neeraj resided in\nthat apartment either as a co-tenant or sub-tenant\nthereof.      The allegation that the suicide letter was\nwritten by Neeraj has already been held not proved\nbeyond reasonable doubt, therefore, in our view, there\nis no worthwhile evidence against Neeraj. Hence, his\nacquittal by the High Court calls for no interference.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_133\">85.      Insofar as Santosh is concerned barring the\ntenancy of that apartment being with him, rest of the\ncircumstances relied by the prosecution have not been\nfound proved beyond reasonable doubt. In our view,\nmere tenancy of that apartment being with Santosh,\nby itself, would not constitute a chain so far complete\nas to logically infer that in all human probability the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.

Thus, possibility\n                   of some third person entering the\n                   apartment          and    committing\n                   murder is not ruled out.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_135\">         b)        Mere presence of a dead body in\n                   an apartment is not enough to\n                   convict a tenant or owner of that\n                   apartment           for     murder,\n                   particularly when there is no\n                   admissible evidence to prove that\n                   around the plausible time of\n                   murder the accused was present\n                   there, or was last seen with the\n                   deceased, and had motive to\n                   finish off the deceased;\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">Criminal Appeal No.575 of 2011 Etc.
