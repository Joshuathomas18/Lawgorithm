P.C.\n\t1973,  for withdrawing the prosecution against the  accused,\n\tare that the prosecution is  not able to produce  sufficient\n\tevidence to sustain the charge, or that the prosecution does\n\tnot  appear  to\t be well rounded, or that  there  are  other\n\tcircumstances\twhich  clearly\tshow  that  the\t object\t  of\n\tadministration of justice would not be advanced or furthered\n\tby going on with the prosecution.  It is not sufficient\t for\n\tthe  prosecution merely to say that it is not  expedient  to\n\tproceed with the prosecution.  The ultimate guiding  consid-\n\teration\t must  always be the interest of  administration  of\n\tjustice\t and  that is the touchstone on which  the  question\n\tmust be determined.  No hard and fast rule can he laid\tdown\n\tnor can any categories of cases be defined in which  consent\n\tshould be granted or refused.  It must ultimately depend  on\n\tthe  facts  and circumstances of each case in the  light  of\n\twhat  is necessary in order to promote the ends of  justice,\n\tbecause,  the objective of every judicial. process  must  be\n\tthe attainment of justice. [338 C--F]\n\t    Where,  therefore, the Magistrate\tgranted\t  permission\n\tfor   withdrawal, because the prosecution averred  that\t the\n\tevidence  collected during investigation was not  sufficient\n\tto sustain the charge against the accused and after satisfy-\n\ting  himself, by perusing the case diary, that the  averment\n\tof  the\t prosecution was justified, the High  Court  was  in\n\terror  in setting aside the order of the Magistrate. In\t the\n\tinstant\t case,. the High Court also erred in observing\tthat\n\tthe Magistrate had not perused the case diary, and that\t the\n\tMagistrate  had\t accorded  consent  for\t withdrawal  of\t the\n\tprosecution  by accepting the prosecution case that  it\t was\n\tinexpedient to proceed with the case. [338 H; 339 A]\n\t    Where,  in the connected case, the Magistrate  gave\t his\n\tconsent\t for  withdrawal on the ground that it was  adminis-\n\ttratively  considered  by the  State inexpedient to  proceed\n\twith  the case, though it was not a valid ground, no  useful\n\tpurpose\t would\tbe served in compelling the  prosecution  to\n\tproceed with the case, because, both cases arose out of\t the\n\tsame incident and the evidence in regard to both was  admit-\n\ttedly the same. [339 C\tD]\n\t    Where the application made by the prosecution for  with-\n\tdrawal\tshowed that the clash in which certain persons\twere\n\tinjured\t arose out of rivalry between two trade unions,\t but\n\tthat since the date of the incident calm and peace prevailed\n\tin  the\t industrial undertaking, the Trial  Court  would  be\n\tjustified  in  granting consent for the\t withdrawal  of\t the\n\tprosecution and the High Court would be in error in  setting\n\taside that order.  In the present case, the State felt\tthat\n\tit  would  not be conducive to the interests of\t justice  to\n\tcontinue  the prosecution, since the prosecution or  convic-\n\ttion  of the accused would rouse feelings of bitterness\t and\n\tantagonism  and\t disturb the calm  and\tpeaceful  atmosphere\n\tprevailing  in the undertaking.\t Ultimately,  every  offence\n\thas  a social or economic cause behind it and if  the  State\n\tfeels  that the elimination or eradication of the social  or\n\teconomic  cause of the crime would be better served  by\t not\n\tproceeding  with  the prosecution. the State  should  be  at\n\tliberty to withdraw from the prosecution.

We are disposing of them by\t a  common  judgment\n\tsince  the question which arises  for consideration in\tboth\n\tsets of appeals is as to what is the extent of the power  of\n\tthe  Court to give consent to withdrawal of prosecution\t and\n\tdischarge  of the accused under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 494</a> of the  Criminal\n\tProcedure Code.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\t    Taking  up\tfirst Criminal Appeals Nos. 308 and  309  of\n\t1975, both these criminal appeals arise out of\tprosecutions\n\tlaunched   in respect of offences alleged to have been\tcom-\n\tmitted in the course of the same incident.  The police filed\n\ta case against nine respondents in Criminal Appeals No.. 308\n\tof 1975 charging them for  offences under <a href=\"/doc/1096965/\" id=\"a_3\">sections 143</a>,\t <a href=\"/doc/1599401/\" id=\"a_4\">341</a>\n\tand  <a href=\"/doc/729270/\" id=\"a_5\">138</a>  of the  Indian Penal\tCode  and <a href=\"/doc/1194614/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 7</a>  of\t the\n\tCriminal  Law  Amendment Act.  It appears  that\t before\t the\n\ttrial could proceed against the respondents, an\t application\n\twas  made by Court Sub-Inspector, who was in charge  of\t the\n\tprosecution,  praying for permission for withdrawal  of\t the\n\tprosecution  on\t two grounds.  One ground was  that  it\t was\n\tconsidered  inexpedient\t to proceed with the case while\t the\n\tother  was that the evidence collected during  investigation\n\twas meagre to proceed against  the  respondents and that  no\n\tuseful\tpurpose would be served by proceeding with the\tcase\n\tagainst them.  The learned Magistrate took the view that  it\n\twas  not  sufficient ground for according consent  that\t the\n\tprosecution  considered\t it inexpedient to  proceed  further\n\twith  the  case.  But so far as the second ground  was\tcon-\n\tcerned,\t the  learned Magistrate held that it  was  a  valid\n\tground\tand  he did not rest this conclusion merely  on\t the\n\taverment made by the Court Sub-Inspector but he also perused\n\tthe  case diary for the purpose of satisfying  himself\tthat\n\tthe  evidence  was  not sufficient to  proceed\tagainst\t the\n\trespondents.   The  learned  Magistrate felt  that  in\tthis\n\tsituation it was proper to accord consent for withdrawal  of\n\tthe  prosecution, since compelling the State to go  on\twith\n\tthe prosecution in these circumstances would involve  unnec-\n\tessary\texpenditure  and waste of public time,\twhich  could\n\totherwise  be profitably utilised for other  judicial  work.\n\tThe  Learned  Magistrate accordingly allowed the Court\tSub-\n\tInspector  to  withdraw the prosecution and  discharged\t the\n\trespondents  under. Section. 494 of  the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_7\">Criminal  Procedure\n\tCode</a>.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\t  It seems that this order of the learned Magistrate accord-\n\ting consent to the withdrawal came to the notice of the High\n\tCourt  and  prima facie taking the view that it\t was  not  a\n\tproper order, the High Court suo moto issued notices to\t the\n\tState  as well as the respondents calling upon them to\tshow\n\tcause  why this order should not  be quashed and set  aside.\n\tThe matter was heard by a single judge of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\t337</span>\n\tthe  High Court and the learned judge quashed and Set  aside\n\tthe order passed by the learned Magistrate with the  follow-\n\ting observations :--\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">\t\t\t&quot;The Magistrate should have perused the case\n\t\t diary\tto see if there was sufficient material\t for\n\t\t framing  of charge.

It  was pointed out by this  Court  <a href=\"/doc/726197/\" id=\"a_10\">in\n\t\t that  case</a> that in granting consent  to  withdrawal\n\t\t from  prosecution, the Court undoubtedly  exercises\n\t\t judicial  discretion, but it does not\tfollow\tthat\n\t\t the discretion is to be exercised only with  refer-\n\t\t ence  to material gathered by the judicial  method.\n\t\t Having\t said this, the Court proceeded to enunciate\n\t\t the principles which should ;guide the exercise  of\n\t\t this discretion:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\t\t\t&quot;In understanding and applying the  Section,\n\t\t two  main features thereof have to be kept in mind.\n\t\t The initiative is that of the Public Prosecutor and\n\t\t what  the Court has to do is only to give its\tcon-\n\t\t sent and not to determine any matter judicially.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\t\t &quot;   ......   The  Judicial  function,\t  therefore,\n\t\t implicit in the exercise of judicial discretion for\n\t\t granting the consent should normally mean that\t the\n\t\t Court\thas  to satisfy itself\tthat  the  executive\n\t\t function  of  the Public Prosecutor  has  not\tbeen\n\t\t improperly exercised, or that it is not an  attempt\n\t\t to interfere with the normal course of justice\t for\n\t\t illegitimate, reasons\tor purposes.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\t\t\t&quot;   ......

There is, however,  a  general\n\t\t concurrence   at least in the later case--that\t the\n\t\t application for consent may legitimately be made by\n\t\t the  Public Prosecutor for reasons not confined  to\n\t\t the judicial prospects of the prosecution.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">\t\t (1) [1957] S.C.R. 279.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\t\t 338</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">\t\t This  Court  had again occasion  to  consider\tthis\n\t\t question  in  M.N.

He has to\tmake\n\tout  some  ground which would show that the  prosecution  is\n\tsought\tto be withdrawn because inter alia  the\t prosecution\n\tmay  not be able to produce sufficient evidence\t to  sustain\n\tthe  charge  or that the prosecution does not appear  to  be\n\twell  rounded  or that there are other\tcircumstances  which\n\tclearly\t show that  the object of administration of  justice\n\twould  not  be advanced or furthered by going  on  with\t the\n\tprosecution.  The ultimate guiding consideration must always\n\tbe the interest of administration of justice and that is the\n\ttouchstone on which the question must be determined  whether\n\tthe prosecution should be allowed to be withdrawn.\n\t    Now\t in the present case it is clear that  according  to\n\tthe prosecution, the evidence collected during investigation\n\twas  not  sufficient to sustain the charge against  the\t re-\n\tspondent and the learned Magistrate was satisfied in  regard\n\tto the truth of this averment made by the Court\t Sub-Inspec-\n\ttor.   It  is difficult for us to understand how   the\tHigh\n\tCourt  could possibly observe in its order that\t the  Magis-\n\ttrate  had  not\t perused the ease diary when  in  terms\t the\n\tlearned Magistrate has stated in his order that he had\tread\n\tthe  ease diary and it was after reading it that be  was  of\n\tthe  opinion that the averment of the prosecution  that\t the\n\tevidence was not sufficient was not ill-founded. Then  again\n\tit  is\tdifficult  to comprehend how the  High\tCourt  could\n\tpossibly say that the learned Magistrate accorded consent to\n\tthe withdrawal of the prosecution on the ground that it\t was\n\tinexpedient to proceed with\n\t(1)[1972]  (2 )\t S.C.R. 599.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">\t339</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">\tthe  case,  when, in so many terms, the\t learned  Magistrate\n\trejected that ground and granted consent only on the  second\n\tground\tbased on inadequacy of evidence.  There is no  doubt\n\tthat  the learned Magistrate was right in  granting  consent\n\tand  the  High Count committed a manifest  error  m  setting\n\taside the order of  the\t learned Magistrate.  We accordingly\n\tallow  Criminal Appeal No. 208 of 1975, set aside the  order\n\tof High Court and restore that of the learned Magistrate.\n\t    Criminal  Appeal No. 309 of 1975 also arises out of\t the\n\tsame incident and the only difference between this  Criminal\n\tAppeal\tand  the earlier one is that  the  .respondents\t are\n\tdifferent.  It is no doubt true that in this case the  Court\n\tSub-Inspector  based  his  application for  consent  to\t the\n\twithdrawal  of\tthe prosecution on the ground  that  it\t was\n\tadministratively  considered  by the  State  inexpedient  to\n\tproceed\t with  the case and that, as  already  pointed\tout,\n\twould not be a valid ground.  But since both the cases arise\n\tout of the same incident and the evidence in regard to\tboth\n\tis admittedly the same, we  do\t  not think that any  useful\n\tpurpose\t would be served  by  compelling    the\t prosecution\n\tto  proceed  with the case against the respondents  in\t the\n\tpresent case.

The\tcase\n\tout of which this appeal arises was the result of a  serious\n\trivalry between two trade unions in an industrial  undertak-\n\ting.   It  seems that the respondents who are members of one\n\ttrade  union   tried  to break up, a  procession  which\t was\n\torganised  by the rival trade union and this led to a  clash\n\tresulting  in injuries to various persons.  The\t respondents\n\twere  charge-sheeted for various offences arising  out\tthis\n\tincident and they were committed to the Court of sessions to\n\tstand  trial for offences under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_11\">sections 147</a>, <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_12\">148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_13\">149</a>,\t <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_14\">307</a>\n\tand  <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_15\">324</a>  I.P.C.  However, before the trial  commenced,\t  an\n\tapplication   was  made\t by the Public\tProsecutor  for\t the\n\tconsent of the court to withdraw the prosecution against the\n\trespondents under section 494 of the Code of Criminal Proce-\n\tdure.  There were five grounds on which the application\t was\n\tbased.\t Of them two only are important. One  was  that\t the\n\toccurrence  arose out of labour union trouble and since\t the\n\tdate  of  the  occurrence, there was  industrial  peace\t and\n\tharmony\t and  the other was that withdrawal of the  prosecu-\n\ttion   would   help  maintain cordiality between  the  rival\n\ttrade  unions.\tThe learned Sessions Judge was impressed  by\n\tthese two grounds and he granted consent to  the  withdrawal\n\tof  the\t prosecution against the respondents.\tThe  reasons\n\twhich  weighed\twith him may be stated in his own  words  as\n\tfollows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\t\t\t&quot;The grounds are that the incident had\tbeen\n\t\t the  outcome of labour trouble. which has now\tsub-\n\t\t sided and that the Government, in order to maintain\n\t\t cordial  relationship\tbetween the  mineowners\t and\n\t\t good  labour  relationship wants  to  withdraw\t the\n\t\t case.\tThe case, as if\t I  find,  arose  on account\n\t\t of labour union rivalry and the  occurrence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\t\t 340</span>\n\t\t place to sabotage a procession led by\trival  trade\n\t\t union.\t The intention being to keep labour  trouble\n\t\t in abeyance, I accord consent of this court for the\n\t\t withdrawal&quot;  ........\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">\t    The\t High  Court  in this case too acted  suo  moto\t and\n\tissued\tnotices.  to the State and the\trespondents  calling\n\tupon  them to show cause why the order of the  learned\tSes-\n\tsions Judge should not be set aside.  The case was heard  by\n\tthe  same learned judge who heard the earlier  two  criminal\n\tappeals\t and the learned judge set aside the order  granting\n\tconsent to the withdrawal of the prosecution and quashed the\n\torder  of  acquittal passed by the  learned  Magistrate\t and\n\tdirected the sessions Judge to proceed with the trial of the\n\tcase.  Hence  the present appeal by the State  with  Special\n\tLeave obtained from this Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\t    We\thave already discussed the principles  which  should\n\tgovern\tcases of this kind where an application is  made  by\n\tthe Public Prosecutor for grant of consent to the withdrawal\n\tof  prosecution under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_16\">section 494</a> of the Criminal  Procedure\n\tCode.  We have pointed out that the paramount  consideration\n\tin  all these cases must be the interest  of  administration\n\tof justice.  No hard and fast rule can be laid down nor\t can\n\tany  categories of cases be defined in which consent  should\n\tbe  granted  or refused.  It must ultimatelY depend  on\t the\n\tfacts and circumstances of each case in the light of what is\n\tnecessary  in order to promote the ends of justice,  because\n\tthe objective of every judicial process must be the  attain-\n\tment of justice.  Now, in the present case, the\t application\n\tmade  by the Public Prosecutor clearly shows that the  inci-\n\tdent had arisen out of rivalry between two trade unions\t and\n\tsince the date of the incident calm and peaceful  atmosphere\n\tprevailed  in the industrial undertaking.  In these  circum-\n\tstances,  the State felt that it would not be  conducive  to\n\tthe interest of justice to continue the prosecution  against\n\tthe respondents, since the prosecution with the\t possibility\n\tof  conviction\tof the respondents would rouse\tfeelings  of\n\tbitterness and antagonism and disturb the calm and  peaceful\n\tatmosphere  prevailing\tin the industrial  undertaking.\t  We\n\tcannot forget that ultimately every offence has a social  or\n\teconomic  cause\t behind it and if the State feels  that\t the\n\telimination  or eradication of the social or economic  cause\n\tof  the crime would be better served by not proceeding\twith\n\tthe  prosecution, the State should clearly be at liberty  to\n\twithdraw  from\tthe prosecution.
