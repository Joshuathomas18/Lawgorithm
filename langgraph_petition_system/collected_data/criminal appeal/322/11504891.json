P/72\n                           and whereas, on 20/07/2011 i.e. after more than one month from the date of\n                           seizure of the car, the Investigating Officer PW/47 Gopal Suryawanshi\n                           found that on the back seat of the car, there were some blood like spots\n                           which were cut by him with a blade and were sent for the forensic report,\n                           and the trial Court has opined that the aforesaid blood found on the back\n                           seat of the car matched with the DNA of the deceased persons and of one\n                           other unknown person. In para 120 of its judgment, the learned Judge of\n                           the Trial Court has taken the aforesaid circumstance against the appellants\n                           holding that the blood stains found on the back seat of the car were that of\n                           the deceased persons only proved as Ex.P/31, however, in the considered\n                           opinion of this Court, the said finding is perverse for the reason that the\n                           prosecution has not produced any FSL report on record to demonstrate that\n                           the blood like stain collected from the back seat of the car was actually of\n                           blood only and not of any other liquid of the body, viz., sweat. So far as the\n                           DNA is concerned, it is common knowledge that it can be obtained from\n                           the body fluid, blood, saliva or sweat and as it is also contained in the skin\n                           cells of a person, it is normally left on the spot unknowingly by the accused\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">Signed by: KHEMRAJ JOSHI</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">Signing time: 21-12-2022</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">13:29:39</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                                                  17</span>\n\n                           or the victims, thus, if DNA has been found from the vehicle of the\n                           deceased himself and of his wife, then it cannot be concluded that they\n                           were murdered in that car as there is no forensic report available to\n                           demonstrate that there was blood on the back seat of the car. This fact is\n                           also substantiated by the fact that what Ex.P/31 states is that the DNA\n                           samples taken from the car and not the DNA samples taken from the blood\n                           recovered from the car.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                           27]   Now coming to the fingerprints, it is apparent that the fingerprints of\n                           all the accused persons have also been obtained vide Ex.P/32 to P/38 and\n                           P/40 to P/41. During the course of investigation, the prosecution has also\n                           found five chance finger print marks in the inner side of central glass of the\n                           Santro Car which was allegedly used to carry the bodies of both the\n                           deceased persons, but vide Ex.D/14, it has been opined that none with the\n                           chance fingerprint marks matched with the accused persons. Thus, it is\n                           apparent that the prosecution has miserably failed to collect any forensic\n                           evidence, tying any of the accused persons with the deceased persons at the\n                           scene of crime.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                           MOTIVE.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                           28]   Now, so far as the other evidence collected by the prosecution to\n                           connect the appellants with the offence is concerned, it is based on a story\n                           of proposed purchase of land by deceased Yeshwant from one Santosh\n                           Dhobi (PW/34) through the appellant Shriram.

In such\n                           circumstances, we have to scrutinize the evidence on the back drop that the\n                           motive in the present case is missing.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">                           30]   So far as the involvement of the appellant Sunita Bai in CRA\n                           No.4409/2018is concerned, it is alleged against her that she obtained\n                           various ornaments from the deceased Gajrabai on the pretext of wearing\n                           them in some marriage, but later-on she never returned the ornaments to\n                           the deceased Gajrabai and although this fact has been sought to be proved\n                           by WP/12 Madhubala, the daughter of deceased Gajrabai who has stated\n                           that she had heard this version between her mother Gajrabai and the\n                           appellant Sunitabai as she was present at that time and she has also stated\n                           that she would recognize the ornaments were obtained by appellant\n                           Sunitabai but admittedly, there is no recovery of ornaments effected from\n                           the appellant Sunita bai. In such circumstances, so far as the involvement\n                           of the appellant Sunita bai in the present case is concerned, this Court is\n                           not satisfied with the oral evidence collected by the prosecution without\n                           there being any tangible material on record to connect the appellant Sunita\n                           bai with the offence.

It is stated that Yashwant Patidar\n                           had given a sum of Rs.30-40 Lakhs to his friends appellant Shriram Kalota\n                           to purchase the land of Santosh Dhobi (Pw/34), however, instead of\n                           purchasing the land for the deceased, appellant Shriram Kalota used the\n                           aforesaid amount on his own and defalcated the same and as the deceased\n                           Yashwant was pressurizing the appellant Shriram to register the sale deed\n                           that is why the appellant Shriram with a view to murder Yashwant and his\n                           wife Gajrabai who was privy to their transaction, hatched the conspiracy to\n                           commit their murder and to burn their bodies with a view to destroy the\n                           evidence and this purpose, he also included his brother-in-law Rahul Mori\n                           for a sum of Rs.5 Lakhs and subsequently it was increased to Rs.10 Lakhs.\n                           Thus, Rahul along with his other two friends Vikram and Jeevan, abducted\n                           and committed the murder of Yashwant and his wife Gajrabai. According\n                           to their plan, on 18/05/2011, appellant Shriram Kalota asked Yashwant and\n                           his wife Gajra to go to Indore where brother-in-law Rahul Mori would\n                           meet them and would get the registry done, and as per this plan, when the\n                           deceased Yashwant reached Indore along with his wife Gajrabai.

The aforesaid factual aspect of the matter clearly reveals\n                           that so far as the manner in which the Santro car has been seized from the\n                           house of the appellant Shriram Kalota is concerned, it makes the\n                           prosecution case highly dubious and cannot be relied upon. As has already\n                           been held that the prosecution has not been able to prove that the stain\n                           which was collected from the back seat of the car was a blood stain and\n                           thus, the DNA of the aforesaid stain is of no consequence when the car\n                           itself belong to the deceased persons, in such circumstances, this Court is\n                           of the considered opinion that the prosecution has not been able to prove its\n                           case beyond reasonable doubt against the appellant Shriram Kalota and as\n                           such he is entitled to the benefit of doubt and is entitled to be acquitted.\n                           73]   Additionally, this Court is also skeptical about the story of the\n                           prosecution that the appellant Shriram sent the deceased Yashwant and his\n                           wife to get the registry of a land situated in district Dhar, to Indore which\n                           appears improbable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">                           74]   So far as the appellant Rahul Mori is concerned, from his possession,\n                           a broken mobile of the deceased Yashwant as also two wrist watches have\n                           been seized which have been duly identified by the son and the daughter of\n                           the deceased persons.
