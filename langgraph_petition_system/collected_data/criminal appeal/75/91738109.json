Gavai &amp; B.P. Colabawalla, JJ) by which, while releasing the\napplicant/appellant on bail, this Court has directed the applicant to report\nto the DCB CID, Unit-3 on every Monday and Thursday between 10.00 a.m.\nto 12.00 p.m.\n\n\n2]       Learned counsel appearing for the applicant submitted that the\napplicant is regularly attending the office of DCB CID, Unit-3 pursuant to\nthe order dated 20th December, 2017. However, the condition to continue\nattend the office of DCBCID, Unit-3 is causing prejudice to him as his liberty\nis curtailed, so also there is no reason to continue this condition.\n\n\n3]       Learned APP for the State opposed the application by contending that\nthere shall be check on the activities of the applicant, hence the condition\nmay not be relaxed.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                     4/5\n\n\n\n       ::: Uploaded on - 11/04/2019                  ::: Downloaded on - 11/04/2019 22:29:19 :::\n                                                                  (3)APPA-2042-18.doc\n\n\n\n4]     Having heard the submissions advanced by both the sides, we are of\nthe opinion that as the applicant has already adhered to the condition of\nattendance imposed vide order dated 20 th December, 2017 till date, interest\nof respondents would be served, if the applicant is directed to attend the\noffice of DCB CID, Unit-3 once in a month.
