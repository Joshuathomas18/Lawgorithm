Lodha, J.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">            Delinquent juveniles need to  be  dealt  with  differently  from\nadults.   International covenants and domestic  laws  in  various  countries\nhave  prescribed   minimum   standards   for   delinquent    juveniles   and\njuveniles   in   conflict   with   law.    These   standards  provide   what\norders  may  be   passed   regarding   delinquent      juveniles   and   the\norders  that  may  not  be  passed  against them.   This  group  of  matters\nraises the question of when should a claim of juvenility be  recognised  and\nsent for determination when it is raised for the first  time  in  appeal  or\nbefore this Court or raised in trial and appeal but  not  pressed  and  then\npressed for the first time before this Court or even raised  for  the  first\ntime after final disposal of the case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">2.          It so happened that when criminal  appeal  preferred  by  Abuzar\nHossain @ Gulam Hossain came up for consideration before a  two-Judge  Bench\n(Harjit Singh Bedi and J.M. Panchal, JJ) on 10.11.2009,  on  behalf  of  the\nappellant, a plea of juvenility on the date  of  incident  was  raised.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"127981871\" id=\"span_1\">In\nsupport of the contention that the appellant was juvenile  on  the  date  of\nincident and as such he could not have  been  tried  in  a  normal  criminal\ncourt, reliance was placed on a decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/127981871/\" id=\"a_1\">Gopinath Ghosh  v.\nState of West Bengal</a>[1].</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1185079\" id=\"span_2\">On the other hand, on  behalf  of  the  respondent,\nState of West Bengal, in opposition to that plea, reliance was placed  on  a\nlater decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1185079/\" id=\"a_2\">Akbar Sheikh and others  v.  State  of  West\nBengal</a>[2].</span> The Bench found that there was  substantial  discordance  in  the\napproach of the matter on the question of juvenility in Gopinath  Ghosh1  on\nthe one hand and the two decisions of this Court in Akbar Sheikh2  and  Hari\nRam v. State of Rajasthan and Another[3]. The Bench was of the opinion  that\nas the issue would arise in a very large number of cases,  it  was  required\nto be referred to a larger Bench  as  the  judgment  in  Akbar  Sheikh2  and\nGopinath Ghosh1 had been rendered by  co-ordinate  Benches  of  this  Court.\nThis is how these matters have come up before us.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\">3.

It\nwas in the backdrop of these facts that Gopinath Ghosh1 was relied  upon  in\nsupport of the proposition that notwithstanding the fact that  the  plea  of\njuvenility had not been pressed, it was obligatory on the court to  go  into\nthe question of juvenility and determine his age.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">12.         Gopinath Ghosh1 was a case where he  was  convicted  along  with\ntwo others for an offence under Section 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 34</a> of IPC  and\nsentenced to suffer imprisonment for life by the trial court. He and two co-\naccused preferred  criminal  appeal  before  Calcutta  High  Court.  In  the\nappeal, two accused were acquitted while  the  conviction  and  sentence  of\nGopinath Ghosh was maintained. Gopinath Ghosh filed appeal by special  leave\nbefore this Court. On his behalf, the argument was raised that on  the  date\nof offence, i.e. on  19.8.1974  he  was  aged  below  18  years  and  he  is\ntherefore a “child” within the meaning of the expression in the <a href=\"/doc/101911317/\" id=\"a_31\">West  Bengal\nChildren Act,  1959</a>  and,  therefore,  the  court  had  no  jurisdiction  to\nsentence him to suffer imprisonment after holding a trial. Having regard  to\nthe contention raised on behalf of  the  appellant,  this  Court  framed  an\nissue for determination; what was the age  of  the  accused  Gopinath  Ghosh\n(appellant) on the date of offence for which he  was  tried  and  convicted?\nThe issue was remitted to the Sessions Judge, Nadia  to  ascertain  his  age\nand submit the finding. The Additional Sessions Judge, First  Court,  Nadia,\naccordingly, held an inquiry and after recording the  evidence  and  calling\nfor medical report and after hearing parties certified that  Gopinath  Ghosh\nwas aged between 16 and 17 years on the date of  the  offence.  The  finding\nsent by the Additional Sessions Judge was not questioned before this  Court.\nThe Court examined the scheme of <a href=\"/doc/101911317/\" id=\"a_32\">West Bengal Children  Act,  1959</a>  and  also\nnoted <a href=\"/doc/158084652/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 24</a> thereof which had an  overriding  effect  taking  away  the\npower of the court to impose the sentence of imprisonment  unless  the  case\nwas covered by the proviso thereto. Then in paragraph 10 (pg.  231)  of  the\nReport, this Court held as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">           “10. Unfortunately, in this case, appellant Gopinath Ghosh never\n           questioned the jurisdiction of the Sessions  Court  which  tried\n           him for the offence of murder. Even the appellant had given  his\n           age as 20  years  when  questioned  by  the  learned  Additional\n           Sessions Judge. Neither the appellant nor  his  learned  counsel\n           appearing before the learned Additional Sessions Judge  as  well\n           as at  the  hearing  of  his  appeal  in  the  High  Court  ever\n           questioned the jurisdiction of the trial court to hold the trial\n           of the appellant, nor was  it  ever  contended  that  he  was  a\n           juvenile delinquent within the meaning of the Act and therefore,\n           the Court had no jurisdiction to try him, as well as  the  Court\n           had no jurisdiction to sentence him to suffer  imprisonment  for\n           life. It was for the first time that this contention was  raised\n           before this Court. However, in view of the underlying intendment\n           and beneficial provisions of the Act read  with  clause  (f)  of\n           <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 39</a> of the Constitution which  provides  that  the  State\n           shall direct its policy towards securing that children are given\n           opportunities and facilities to develop in a healthy manner  and\n           in conditions of freedom and  dignity  and  that  childhood  and\n           youth are protected against exploitation and against  moral  and\n           material abandonment, we consider  it  proper  not  to  allow  a\n           technical contention that this contention  is  being  raised  in\n           this Court for the first time  to  thwart  the  benefit  of  the\n           provisions being extended to the appellant, if he was  otherwise\n           entitled to it.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">13.

Before we part with this judgment, we must take notice of a\n           developing situation in recent months in  this  Court  that  the\n           contention about age of a convict and claiming  the  benefit  of\n           the  relevant  provisions  of  the  Act  dealing  with  juvenile\n           delinquents prevalent in various States is raised for the  first\n           time in this Court and this  Court  is  required  to  start  the\n           inquiry afresh. Ordinarily this  Court  would  be  reluctant  to\n           entertain a contention based on factual averments raised for the\n           first time before it. However, the Court is equally reluctant to\n           ignore, overlook or nullify the beneficial provisions of a  very\n           socially  progressive  statute  by  taking  shield  behind   the\n           technicality of the contention being raised for the  first  time\n           in this Court. A way  has  therefore,  to  be  found  from  this\n           situation not conducive to speedy  disposal  of  cases  and  yet\n           giving effect to the letter and  the  spirit  of  such  socially\n           beneficial legislation. We are of the opinion  that  whenever  a\n           case is brought before the Magistrate and the accused appears to\n           be aged 21 years or below, before proceeding with the  trial  or\n           undertaking an inquiry, an inquiry must be made about the age of\n           the accused on the date of the occurrence. This ought to be more\n           so where special Acts dealing with juvenile  delinquent  are  in\n           force. If necessary, the Magistrate may refer the accused to the\n           Medical Board or the Civil Surgeon, as  the  case  may  be,  for\n           obtaining creditworthy evidence about age. The Magistrate may as\n           well call upon accused also to  lead  evidence  about  his  age.\n           Thereafter, the learned Magistrate  may  proceed  in  accordance\n           with law. This procedure, if properly followed,  would  avoid  a\n           journey upto the Apex Court and the return journey to the grass-\n           root court. If necessary and found expedient, the High Court may\n           on its administrative side issue necessary instructions to  cope\n           with the situation herein indicated.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">14.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1161696\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/1161696/\" id=\"a_35\">Bhoop Ram v. State of U.P.</a>[4],  a  two-Judge  Bench  of  this\nCourt was concerned with the question as to whether the appellant Bhoop  Ram\nshould have been treated as a “child” within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/108038145/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 2(4)</a>  of\nthe U.P. Children Act, 1951 and sent to an  approved  school  for  detention\ntherein till he attained the age of 18 years instead of being  sentenced  to\nundergo imprisonment in jail. In Bhoop  Ram4,  the  Chief  Medical  Officer,\nBareilly gave a certificate  that  as  per  the  radiology  examination  and\nphysical features, he appeared to be 30 years of age as on 30.4.1987.  Bhoop\nRam  did not place any other material before the Sessions Judge  except  the\nschool certificate to prove that he had not completed 16 years on  the  date\nof commission of the  offences.  The  Sessions  judge  rejected  the  school\ncertificate produced by him on the ground that “it is not  unusual  that  in\nschools ages are understated by one or two years for  future  benefits”.  As\nregards medical certificate the Sessions Judge observed that as he  happened\nto be about 28-29 years of age on  1.6.1987,  he  would  have  completed  16\nyears on the date  of  occurrence.  Before  the  Court,  on  behalf  of  the\nappellant, Bhoop Ram, it was contended that school certificate  produced  by\nhim contained definite information regarding date of birth and  that  should\nhave prevailed over the certificate of the doctor  and  the  Sessions  Judge\ncommitted wrong in doubting the correctness of the school certificate.  This\nCourt on consideration of the matter held that  appellant  Bhoop  Ram  could\nnot have completed 16 years of age on 3.10.1975  when  the  occurrence  took\nplace and as such he ought to  have  been  treated  as  “child”  within  the\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/108038145/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 2(4)</a> of the U.P. Children Act, 1951 and dealt with  under\n<a href=\"/doc/147621101/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 29</a> of the Act. The Court gave  the  following  reasons  for  holding\nappellant, Bhoop Ram, a  “child” on the date of occurrence of the incident:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">           “7.  …….The first is that the appellant has  produced  a  school\n           certificate which carries the date 24-6-1960 against the  column\n           “date of birth”. There is no material before us to hold that the\n           school certificate does not relate to the appellant or that  the\n           entries therein  are  not  correct  in  their  particulars.  The\n           Sessions Judge has failed to notice this aspect  of  the  matter\n           and appears to have been carried away  by  the  opinion  of  the\n           Chief Medical Officer that the appellant appeared to be about 30\n           years of age as  on  30-4-1987.  Even  in  the  absence  of  any\n           material to  throw  doubts  about  the  entries  in  the  school\n           certificate, the Sessions Judge has brushed it aside  merely  on\n           the surmise that it is not unusual for parents to understate the\n           age of their children by one or two years at the time  of  their\n           admission in schools for securing benefits to  the  children  in\n           their future years. The second factor is that the Sessions Judge\n           has failed to bear in mind that even the trial Judge had thought\n           it fit to award the lesser sentence of imprisonment for life  to\n           the appellant instead of capital punishment  when  he  delivered\n           judgment on 12-9-1977 on the ground the appellant was a  boy  of\n           17 years of age. The observation of the trial Judge  would  lend\n           credence to the appellant&#x27;s case that he was less than  10  (sic\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">           16) years of age on 3-10-1975 when the offences were  committed.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">           The third factor is that though the doctor  has  certified  that\n           the appellant appeared to be 30 years of age  as  on  30-4-1987,\n           his opinion is based only on an estimate and the possibility  of\n           an error of estimate creeping into the opinion cannot  be  ruled\n           out. As regards the opinion of the Sessions Judge, it is  mainly\n           based upon the report of the Chief Medical Officer  and  not  on\n           any independent material. On account of all  these  factors,  we\n           are of the view that the appellant would not have  completed  16\n           years of age on the date the offences were committed……..”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"647057\" id=\"span_4\">15.

At the time of granting  special  leave,  Jagdish  appellant\n           produced High School Certificate,  according  to  which  he  was\n           about 15 years of age  at  the  time  of  occurrence.  Appellant\n           Krishan Kant produced horoscope which  showed  that  he  was  13\n           years of age at the time of  occurrence.  So  far  as  appellant\n           Pradeep is concerned a medical report was  called  for  by  this\n           Court which disclosed that his date of birth as January 7,  1959\n           was acceptable on the basis of various tests  conducted  by  the\n           medical authorities.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">           3. It is thus proved to the satisfaction of this Court  that  on\n           the date of occurrence, the  appellants  had  not  completed  16\n           years of age and as such they should have been dealt with  under\n           the <a href=\"/doc/46149291/\" id=\"a_43\">U.P.

The plea  raised  on  behalf  of\nthe appellants that they were ‘children’  as defined in the  <a href=\"/doc/1973522/\" id=\"a_47\">Bihar  Children\nAct, 1970</a> on the date  of  occurrence  and  their  trial  along  with  adult\naccused by the criminal court was not in accordance with  law  was  rejected\nby the High Court observing that except for the age given by the  appellants\nand the estimate of the  court  at  the  time  of  their  examination  under\nSection 313 of the Code, there was no  other  material  in  support  of  the\nappellants’ claim that they were below 18 years of age.  This  Court  flawed\nthe approach of the High Court and observed as follows :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">           “8. To us it appears that the approach  of  the  High  Court  in\n           dealing with the question of  age  of  the  appellants  and  the\n           denial of benefit to them of the provisions of both the Acts was\n           not proper. Technicalities were allowed to defeat  the  benefits\n           of a socially-oriented legislation like the <a href=\"/doc/40985982/\" id=\"a_48\">Bihar Children  Act,\n           1982</a> and the <a href=\"/doc/49588121/\" id=\"a_49\">Juvenile Justice Act, 1986</a>. If the High  Court  had\n           doubts about the correctness  of  their  age  as  given  by  the\n           appellants and also as estimated by the trial court, it ought to\n           have ordered an enquiry to determine their ages.

Gopinath Ghosh1, Bhoop Ram4 and Pradeep Kumar5 were  elaborately\nconsidered in paragraphs 10, 11  and  12  of  the  Report.

In paragraph 15  of  the\nReport, the Court followed the course adopted in  Gopinath  Ghosh1  ,  Bhoop\nRam4 and Pradeep Kumar5 and held as under :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">           “15. The correctness of the estimate of  age  as  given  by  the\n           trial court was neither doubted  nor  questioned  by  the  State\n           either in the High Court or in this  Court.  The  parties  have,\n           therefore, accepted the correctness of the estimate  of  age  of\n           the three appellants as given by  the  trial  court.  Therefore,\n           these three appellants should not be denied the benefit  of  the\n           provisions of a socially progressive statute. In our  considered\n           opinion, since the plea had been raised in the  High  Court  and\n           because the correctness of the estimate of  their  age  has  not\n           been assailed, it would be fair to assume that on  the  date  of\n           the offence, each one of the appellants squarely fell within the\n           definition  of  the  expression  “child”.  We  are  under  these\n           circumstances reluctant to ignore and  overlook  the  beneficial\n           provisions of the Acts on the technical ground that there is  no\n           other supporting material to support the estimate of ages of the\n           appellants as given by the trial court, though  the  correctness\n           of that estimate has not been put in issue before any forum…..”.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">18.         Mr. Pradip Kr. Ghosh, learned senior counsel for  the  appellant\nAbuzar Hossain @ Gulam  Hossain,  relying  heavily  upon  the  above  cases,\nsubmitted that what was earlier established by  judicial  interpretation  in\nGopinath Ghosh1, Bhoop Ram4 and Pradeep  Kumar5  became  the  statutory  law\nwith the enactment of Section 7A of 2000 Act and Rule 12 of the  2007  Rules\nand in view thereof a different approach is  required  with  regard  to  the\ndelinquent juveniles as and when plea of juvenility  is  raised  before  the\ncourt.  Learned senior counsel would submit that the courts have  to  ensure\nthat the beneficial provisions contained in Section 7A  and   Rule  12   are\nnot frustrated by procedural rigidity. It was submitted that while  enacting\nSection  7A,  the  Legislature  has  taken  note  of  socio-economic  ground\nrealities of the country and had  kept  in  view  juveniles  who  come  from\namongst the poorest of the poor, slum dwellers, street dwellers and some  of\nthose having no shelter, no means of sustenance and for whom it would  be  a\nfar cry to have any documents as they would have neither any  schooling  nor\nany birth registration.  The law has to be applied in  the  manner  so  that\nits benefits are made available to all those who are entitled  to  it.    He\ncontended that the very fact  that  Rule  12  provided  for  every  possible\nopportunity to establish the juvenility and when everything fails  there  is\nthe mandate of holding the medical examination of the delinquent, shows  the\nlegislative intent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">19.         Mr. Pradip Kr. Ghosh,  learned  senior  counsel  also  submitted\nthat the law with regard to juvenile delinquents by insertion of Section  7A\nhas been given retrospective effect and made applicable even after  disposal\nof the case and, therefore, in all such cases, those who had no occasion  to\nclaim the benefit of juvenility in the past deserve fresh opportunity to  be\ngiven and they should be allowed to produce such materials afresh as may  be\navailable  in  support  of  the  claim.  He  submitted  that   a   purposive\ninterpretation to Section 7A and Rule 12  must  be  given  to  bring  within\ntheir fold not only documents which are contemplated in  terms  of  sub-rule\n(3) of Rule 12 but also cases in which no such document is available but  if\nthe accused is referred to a medical board,  his  age  would  eventually  be\nfound to be such as would make him a juvenile.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">20.         Mr. Pradip Kr. Ghosh, learned senior  counsel  did  not  dispute\nthat for the purpose of making  a  claim  with  regard  to  juvenility,  the\ndelinquent  has to produce some material in support of his claim and in  the\nabsence of any documentary evidence,  file at least  a supporting  affidavit\naffirmed by one of his parents or an elder sibling or other relation who  is\ncompetent to depose as to his age so as to make the  court  to  initiate  an\ninquiry under Rule 12(3). He did concede  that a totally frivolous claim  of\njuvenility which on the  face  of  it  is  patently  absurd  and  inherently\nimproper may not be entertained by the court but at the same time the  court\nmust not be hyper-technical and must ensure  that  beneficial  provision  is\nnot defeated by undue technicalities.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\">21.         Learned senior  counsel  submitted  that   the  statement  under\nSection 313 of the Code or the voters’ list may not  be  decisive  but   the\ndocuments of such nature  may be adequate  for  the  court  to  initiate  an\ninquiry in terms of Rule 12(3). According to him, what is  decisive  is  the\nresult of the inquiry under Rule  12(3).   However,  semblance  of  material\nmust justify an order to cause an inquiry to be made to determine the  claim\nof juvenility.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"433094\" id=\"span_7\">22.

The Legislature by bringing  in\nSection 7A has clearly provided that the claim of juvenility may  be  raised\nbefore any court and it shall be recognised at any  stage,  even  after  the\nfinal disposal of the case and such claim shall be determined  in  terms  of\nthe provisions contained in 2000 Act and the Rules made thereunder, even  if\nthe juvenile has ceased to be so on or before the commencement of  the  Act.\nHe would submit that even if the question of juvenility had not been  raised\nby the juvenile  even upto this Court and there is  some  material  to  show\nthat a person is a juvenile on the date of commission of crime,  it  can  be\nrecognised at any stage even at the stage of undergoing sentence. He  agreed\nthat inquiry cannot be initiated on the  basis  of  mere  assertion  of  the\nclaim.   There must be prima facie material  to  initiate  the  inquiry  and\nonce the prima facie test is satisfied, the determination  may  be  made  in\nterms of Rule 12. With reference to Rule 12, learned  senior  counsel  would\nsubmit  that  appearance,  documents  and  medical  evidence  are  the  only\nmaterials which are relevant for determining the age and as such  only  such\nmaterials should form the basis for  forming  an  opinion  about  the  prima\nfacie case. The oral evidence should rarely form the  basis  for  initiation\nof proceeding as in view of Rule 12, the said material can never be used  in\ninquiry and thus forming an opinion on that oral  evidence  will  not  serve\nthe purposes of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">24.         Learned counsel for  the  State  of  Bihar  on  the  other  hand\nsubmitted that Legislature never intended to make Section 7A  applicable  to\nthis Court  after the final disposal of the case.  He submitted  that  there\nwas no provision in  the  Supreme  Court  Rules  to  re-open  the  concluded\nappeals or SLPs. Moreover, when SLP is filed, it is mandatory  that  no  new\nground or document shall be relied upon which  has  not  been  the  part  of\nrecord before the High Court and, therefore, if plea of juvenility  has  not\nbeen raised before the High Court, it cannot be raised  before  this  Court.\nAccording to him, the power under the 2000 Act can be exercised only by  the\nJuvenile Board, Sessions Court or High Court after  final  disposal  of  the\ncase but not this Court. He, however, submitted that the  Supreme  Court  in\nexercise of its power under <a href=\"/doc/500307/\" id=\"a_54\">Article  142</a>  may  remand  the  matter  to  such\nforums, if it appears expedient in the interest of justice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"147254410\" id=\"span_8\">25.          The  amendment  in   2000  Act  by  the  <a href=\"/doc/228942/\" id=\"a_55\">Amendment  Act,  2006</a>,\nparticularly, introduction of Section  7A  and  subsequent  introduction  of\nRule 12 in the 2007 Rules, was sequel to the Constitution Bench decision  of\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/147254410/\" id=\"a_56\">Pratap Singh v. State of Jharkhand and Another</a>[9]  .  In  Hari\nRam3, a two-Judge Bench of this Court extensively considered the  scheme  of\n2000 Act, as amended by 2006 Amendment Act. With  regard  to  sub-rules  (4)\nand (5) of Rule 12, this Court observed as follows :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">           “27.  Sub-rules  (4)  and  (5)  of  Rule  12  are   of   special\n           significance in that  they  provide  that  once  the  age  of  a\n           juvenile or child in conflict with law is found to be less  than\n           18 years on the date of  offence  on  the  basis  of  any  proof\n           specified in sub-rule (3) the court or the Board or as the  case\n           may be the Child Welfare Committee appointed under <a href=\"/doc/46149291/\" id=\"a_57\">Chapter IV of\n           the Act</a>, has to pass a written order  stating  the  age  of  the\n           juvenile or stating the status of the juvenile, and  no  further\n           inquiry is to be conducted by the court or Board after examining\n           and obtaining any other documentary proof referred  to  in  sub-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">           rule (3) of Rule 12. Rule 12, therefore, indicates the procedure\n           to be followed to give effect to the provisions of  Section  7-A\n           when a claim of juvenility is raised.”\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">26.         This Court observed that the scheme of the 2000 Act was to  give\nchildren, who have, for some reason or the other, gone  astray,  to  realize\ntheir mistakes, rehabilitate themselves and rebuild their lives  and  become\nuseful citizens of  the  society,  instead  of  degenerating  into  hardened\ncriminals. In paragraph 59 of the Report, the Court held as under :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">           “59. The law as  now  crystallised  on  a  conjoint  reading  of\n           <a href=\"/doc/157610917/\" id=\"a_58\">Sections 2(k)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/157610917/\" id=\"a_59\">2(l)</a>, 7-A, <a href=\"/doc/158812590/\" id=\"a_60\">20</a> and <a href=\"/doc/196527554/\" id=\"a_61\">49</a> read with Rules 12  and  98,\n           places beyond all doubt that all persons who were below the  age\n           of 18 years on the date of commission of the offence even  prior\n           to 1-4-2001, would be treated as juveniles, even if the claim of\n           juvenility was raised after they had  attained  the  age  of  18\n           years on or before the date of commencement of the Act and  were\n           undergoing sentence upon being convicted.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">27.         The Court observed in Hari Ram3 that often parents of  children,\nwho come from rural backgrounds, are not aware of the actual date  of  birth\nof a child, but relate the same to some event which might have  taken  place\nsimultaneously. In such a situation, the Board and the Courts will  have  to\ntake recourse to the procedure <a href=\"/doc/147254410/\" id=\"a_62\">laid down in</a> Rule 12.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">28.         The judgment in the case of Hari  Ram3  was  delivered  by  this\nCourt on 5.5.2009. On  that  very  day,  judgment   in  Akbar  Sheikh2   was\ndelivered by a two-Judge Bench of which one of us (R.M.  Lodha,  J.)  was  a\nmember. In Akbar Sheikh2 on behalf  of  one  of  the  appellants,  Kabir,  a\nsubmission was made that he was juvenile on the date  of  occurrence.  While\ndealing with the said argument, this Court observed that  no  such  question\nhad ever been raised. Even where a  similar  question  was  raised  by  five\nother accused, no such plea was  raised  even  before  the  High  Court.  On\nbehalf of the appellant, Kabir, in support of the juvenility, two  documents\nwere relied upon, namely,  (i) statement recorded  under Section 313 of  the\nCode and (ii) voters’ list. As regards the statement recorded under  Section\n313, this Court was of the opinion that the said document was not  decisive.\nIn respect of  voters’ list, this Court observed  that  the  same  had  been\nprepared long after the incident occurred and it was again not decisive.  In\nview of these findings, this Court did not find any merit in  the  claim  of\nKabir, one of the appellants,  that he was juvenile and the  submission  was\nrejected. From a careful  reading of the judgment  in the  matter  of  Akbar\nSheikh2, it is clear that the two documents on which   reliance  was  placed\nin  support  of  claim  of  juvenility  were   not   found   decisive   and,\nconsequently, no inquiry for determination of  age  was  ordered.  From  the\nconsideration of the matter by this Court in  Akbar  Sheikh2,  it  is  clear\nthat the case turned on its own facts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">29.         As a matter of fact, prior to the decisions  of  this  Court  in\nHari Ram3 and Akbar Sheikh2, a three-Judge Bench  of  this  Court   speaking\nthrough one of us (R.M. Lodha, J.) in Pawan8  had  considered  the  question\nrelating to  admissibility of claim  of juvenility  for the  first  time  in\nthis  Court with reference to Section 7A. The contention of  juvenility  was\nraised  for  the  first  time  before  this  Court  on  behalf  of  the  two\nappellants, namely, A-1 and A-2. The argument on their  behalf  before  this\nCourt was that they were juvenile within the meaning  of  2000  Act  on  the\ndate of incident and  the  trial  held  against  them  under  the  Code  was\nillegal. With regard to A-1, his school leaving certificate  was  relied  on\nwhile as regards A-2,  reliance was placed on his statement  recorded  under\nSection 313 and the school leaving certificate. Dealing with the  contention\nof juvenility, this Court stated that  the  claim  of  juvenility  could  be\nraised at any stage, even after final disposal of the case.  The Court  then\nframed the question in paragraph 41 of the Report as to whether  an  inquiry\nshould be made or report be called  for  from  the  trial  court  invariably\nwhere juvenility is claimed for the first time before this  Court.   It  was\nheld that where the materials placed  before  this  Court  by  the  accused,\nprima facie, suggested that he was ‘juvenile’ as defined in 2000 Act on  the\ndate of incident, it was necessary to call for the report or an  inquiry  to\nbe made for determination of the age  on  the  date  of  incident.  However,\nwhere a plea of juvenility is  found  unscrupulous  or  the  materials  lack\ncredibility or do not inspire confidence and even prima  facie  satisfaction\nof the court is not made out, further exercise in this  regard  may  not  be\nrequired.  It was also stated that if the plea of juvenility was not  raised\nbefore the trial court or the High Court and is raised for  the  first  time\nbefore this Court, the judicial conscience of the court  must  be  satisfied\nby placing adequate  material that the accused had not attained the  age  of\n18 years on the date of  commission  of  offence.  In  absence  of  adequate\nmaterial, any further inquiry into juvenility would not be required.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">30.          Having  regard  to  the  general  guidelines   highlighted   in\nparagraph 41 with regard to the approach of this Court where  juvenility  is\nclaimed for the first time, the court then considered the  documents  relied\nupon by A-1 and A-2 in support of the claim of juvenility  on  the  date  of\nincident.   In respect of the two documents  relied  upon  by  A-2,  namely,\nstatement under Section 313 of the Code and the school leaving  certificate,\nthis Court observed that the statement recorded  under  Section  313  was  a\ntentative  observation  based  on  physical  appearance  which  was   hardly\ndeterminative  of  age  and  insofar  as  school  leaving  certificate   was\nconcerned, it did not inspire any confidence as it was issued after A-2  had\nalready been convicted and the primary evidence like entry  from  the  birth\nregister had not  been  produced.  As  regards  school  leaving  certificate\nrelied upon by A-1, this Court found that the same had been  procured  after\nhis conviction and no entry from the birth register had been  produced.  The\nCourt was, thus, not prima facie  impressed or  satisfied  by  the  material\nplaced  on  behalf  of  A-1  and  A-2.   Those  documents  were  not   found\nsatisfactory and adequate to call for any report from  the  Board  or  trial\ncourt about the age of A-1 and A-2.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">31.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"893710\" id=\"span_9\">In Jitendra Singh alias <a href=\"/doc/893710/\" id=\"a_63\">Babboo Singh and another   v.  State  of\nUttar Pradesh</a>[10],  on behalf of the appellant, a plea was  raised  that  he\nwas minor within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/157610917/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 2(k)</a> of 2000  Act  on  the  date  of\ncommission of  the  offence.  The  appellant  had  been  convicted  for  the\noffences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/653797/\" id=\"a_65\">Sections 304-B</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/538436/\" id=\"a_66\">498A</a>  IPC  and  sentenced  to\nsuffer seven years’ imprisonment  under the former and two years  under  the\nlatter. The appellant had  got the bail from the High Court  on  the  ground\nof his  age  which  was  on  medical  examination  certified  to  be  around\nseventeen years on the date of commission of the offence. One  of  us  (T.S.\nThakur, J.) who authored the judgment for the Bench held that in  the  facts\nand circumstances of the case, an enquiry for determining  the  age  of  the\nappellant was necessary. This Court referred to  the  earlier  decisions  in\nGopinath Ghosh1,  Bhoop Ram4 , Bhola Bhagat6 ,  Hari  Ram3  and  Pawan8  and\nthen held that the burden of making  out  the  prima  facie  case  had  been\ndischarged. In paragraphs 9, 10 and 11  of  the  Report,  it  was   held  as\nunder:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">           “9. The burden of making out a prima facie case for directing an\n           enquiry has been in our opinion discharged in the  instant  case\n           inasmuch as the appellant has filed along with the application a\n           copy of the school leaving certificate and the  marksheet  which\n           mentions the date of birth of the appellant to be 24-5-1988. The\n           medical examination to which the High Court has referred in  its\n           order granting bail to the appellant also suggests  the  age  of\n           the appellant being 17 years on the  date  of  the  examination.\n           These documents are sufficient at this stage  for  directing  an\n           enquiry and verification of the facts.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"893710\" id=\"span_10\">10. We may all the same hasten to add that the material <a href=\"/doc/893710/\" id=\"a_67\">referred\n           to  above</a>  is  yet  to  be  verified  and  its  genuineness  and\n           credibility determined. There  are  no  doubt  certain  telltale\n           circumstances that may raise a suspicion about  the  genuineness\n           of the documents relied upon by the appellant. For instance, the\n           deceased  Asha  Devi  who  was  married  to  the  appellant  was\n           according to  Dr.  Ashok  Kumar  Shukla,  Pathologist,  District\n           Hospital, Rae Bareilly aged 19 years at the time of  her  death.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">           This would mean as though the appellant husband was much younger\n           to his wife which is  not  the  usual  practice  in  the  Indian\n           context and may happen but infrequently. So also the  fact  that\n           the appellant obtained the school leaving certificate as late as\n           on 17-11-2009  i.e.  after  the  conclusion  of  the  trial  and\n           disposal of the first appeal by the High Court, may call  for  a\n           close scrutiny and examination of the relevant school record  to\n           determine  whether  the  same  is  free  from   any   suspicion,\n           fabrication  or  manipulation.  It  is  also  alleged  that  the\n           electoral rolls showed the age of the accused to  be  around  20\n           years while the extract from the panchayat register  showed  him\n           to be 19 years old.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">           11. All these aspects would call for close and careful  scrutiny\n           by the court below while determining the age of  the  appellant.\n           The date of birth of appellant Jitendra Singh&#x27;s siblings and his\n           parents may also throw considerable light upon these aspects and\n           may have to be looked into for a  proper  determination  of  the\n           question. Suffice it to say while for the present we consider it\n           to be a case fit for directing an enquiry, that direction should\n           not be taken as an expression of any final  opinion  as  regards\n           the true and correct age of the  appellant  which  matter  shall\n           have to be independently examined on the basis of  the  relevant\n           material.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">32.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"284034\" id=\"span_11\">In <a href=\"/doc/284034/\" id=\"a_68\">Daya Nand v.

State of Uttar  Pradesh  and  another</a>[13],  the\nmatter reached this Court from the judgment and order of the Allahabad  High\nCourt.  An F.I.R. was lodged against the appellant, Shah  Nawaz,  and  three\nothers for the offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_71\">Sections 302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_72\">307</a> of  IPC.   The\nmother of the appellant submitted an application  before the  Board  stating\nthat Shah Nawaz was minor at the time of  alleged  occurrence.    The  Board\nafter holding an enquiry declared Shah Nawaz a juvenile under the 2000  Act.\nThe wife of the deceased filed criminal appeal against the judgment  of  the\nBoard before the Additional Sessions Judge, Muzaffarnagar. That  appeal  was\nallowed and the order of the Board  was  set  aside.  Shah  Nawaz  preferred\ncriminal revision before the High Court against the order of the  Additional\nSessions Judge which was dismissed giving rise to appeal  by  special  leave\nbefore this Court. This Court considered Rule 12  of  2007  Rules  and  also\nnoted,  amongst   others,  the  decision  in   Hari   Ram3   and   then   on\nconsideration of the documents, particularly entry relating to the  date  of\nbirth entered in the marksheet held that Shah  Nawaz  was  juvenile  on  the\ndate of occurrence of the incident. This Court in paragraphs 23  and  24  of\nthe Report held as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">           “23. The documents furnished above clearly show that the date of\n           birth of the appellant had been noted as 18-6-1989. Rule  12  of\n           the Rules categorically envisages that the medical opinion  from\n           the Medical Board should be sought only when  the  matriculation\n           certificate or  school  certificate  or  any  birth  certificate\n           issued by a corporation or by any panchayat or  municipality  is\n           not available. We are of the view  that  though  the  Board  has\n           correctly accepted the entry relating to the date  of  birth  in\n           the marksheet and school certificate,  the  Additional  Sessions\n           Judge and the High Court committed a grave error in  determining\n           the age of the appellant ignoring the date of birth mentioned in\n           those documents which is illegal, erroneous and contrary to  the\n           Rules.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">           24. We are satisfied that the entry relating to  date  of  birth\n           entered in the marksheet is one of the valid proofs of  evidence\n           for determination of  age  of  an  accused  person.  The  school\n           leaving certificate is also a valid proof in determining the age\n           of the accused person. Further, the date of birth  mentioned  in\n           the High School marksheet produced by  the  appellant  has  duly\n           been corroborated by  the  school  leaving  certificate  of  the\n           appellant of Class X and has also been proved by  the  statement\n           of the clerk of Nehru High School,  Dadheru,  Khurd-o-Kalan  and\n           recorded by the Board. The date of birth of  the  appellant  has\n           also  been  recorded  as  18-6-1989  in   the   school   leaving\n           certificate issued by the Principal of Nehru Preparatory School,\n           Dadheru, Khurd-o-Kalan, Muzaffarnagar as well as the  said  date\n           of birth mentioned in the school register of the said School  at\n           Sl. No. 1382 which have been proved  by  the  statement  of  the\n           Principal of that School recorded before the Board.”\n\n\n\nIn paragraph 26 of  the  Report,  this  Court  observed  that  Rule  12  has\ndescribed four categories  of  evidence  which  gave  preference  to  school\ncertificate over the medical report.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">35.         In Pawan8, , a 3-Judge Bench has laid  down  the  standards  for\nevaluating claim of juvenility raised for the first time before this  Court.\n If Pawan8 had been cited before the Bench when criminal  appeal  of  Abuzar\nHossain @ Gulam Hossain came up for hearing,  perhaps  reference  would  not\nhave been made.  Be that as it may, in light of the discussion  made  above,\nwe intend to summarise the legal position with regard to Section 7A of  2000\nAct and Rule 12 of the 2007 Rules.  But before we do that,  we  say  a  word\nabout the argument raised on behalf of the State  of  Bihar  that  claim  of\njuvenility cannot be raised before this Court after disposal  of  the  case.\nThe  argument  is  so  hopeless  that  it  deserves  no   discussion.    The\nexpression, ‘any court’ in Section 7A is  too  wide  and  comprehensive;  it\nincludes this Court.  Supreme Court Rules surely do not limit the  operation\nof Section 7A to the  courts  other  than  this  Court  where  the  plea  of\njuvenility is raised for the first time after disposal of the case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">36.         Now, we summarise the position which is as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">      (i)   A claim of juvenility may be raised  at  any  stage  even  after\nfinal disposal of the case.  It may be raised  for  the  first  time  before\nthis Court as well after  final  disposal  of  the  case.     The  delay  in\nraising the claim of juvenility cannot be a ground  for  rejection  of  such\nclaim.  The claim of juvenility can be raised in appeal even if not  pressed\nbefore the trial court and can be raised for  the  first  time  before  this\nCourt though not pressed before the trial court and in appeal court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">      (ii)  For making a claim with regard to juvenility  after  conviction,\nthe claimant must produce some material which may prima  facie  satisfy  the\ncourt that an inquiry into the claim of juvenility  is  necessary.   Initial\nburden has to be discharged by the person who claims juvenility.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">      (iii) As to what materials would prima facie satisfy the court  and/or\nare sufficient for discharging the initial burden cannot be  catalogued  nor\ncan it be laid down as to what weight should be given to  a  specific  piece\nof evidence which may be sufficient to raise presumption of juvenility   but\nthe documents referred to in Rule 12(3)(a)(i) to (iii) shall  definitely  be\nsufficient for prima facie satisfaction of the court about the  age  of  the\ndelinquent necessitating  further  enquiry  under  Rule  12.  The  statement\nrecorded under Section 313 of the Code is  too  tentative  and  may  not  by\nitself  be  sufficient  ordinarily  to  justify  or  reject  the  claim   of\njuvenility. The credibility and/or acceptability of the documents  like  the\nschool  leaving  certificate  or  the  voters’  list,  etc.  obtained  after\nconviction would depend on the facts and circumstances of each case  and  no\nhard and fast rule can be prescribed that they must be prima facie  accepted\nor rejected.  In Akbar Sheikh2 and Pawan8 these  documents  were  not  found\nprima facie credible while in Jitendra Singh10  the documents  viz.,  school\nleaving  certificate,  marksheet  and  the  medical  report   were   treated\nsufficient for directing an inquiry  and  verification  of  the  appellant’s\nage. If such documents prima facie inspire  confidence  of  the  court,  the\ncourt may act upon such documents for the purposes of Section 7A  and  order\nan enquiry for determination of the age of the delinquent.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">      (iv)  An affidavit of the claimant or any of the parents or a  sibling\nor a relative in support of the claim of juvenility  raised  for  the  first\ntime in appeal or revision or before this Court during the pendency of   the\n matter or after disposal of the case shall  not  be  sufficient  justifying\nan enquiry to determine the age of such person unless the  circumstances  of\nthe case are so glaring that satisfy the judicial conscience  of  the  court\nto order an enquiry into determination of age of the delinquent.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">      (v)   The court where the plea  of juvenility is raised for the  first\ntime should always be guided by the  objectives  of  the  2000  Act  and  be\nalive to the position that the beneficent and salutary provisions  contained\nin 2000 Act are not defeated by hyper-technical  approach  and  the  persons\nwho are entitled to get benefits of 2000 Act get such benefits.  The  courts\nshould not be unnecessarily influenced by any  general  impression  that  in\nschools the parents/guardians understate the age of their wards  by  one  or\ntwo  years  for  future  benefits  or  that  age  determination  by  medical\nexamination is not very precise.  The  matter  should  be  considered  prima\nfacie on the touchstone of preponderance of probability.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">      (vi)  Claim of juvenility lacking in credibility or frivolous claim of\njuvenility or patently absurd or inherently improbable claim  of  juvenility\nmust be rejected by the court at threshold whenever raised.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">37.

THAKUR, J.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">      I have had the advantage of going through the  order  proposed  by  my\nesteemed brother R.M. Lodha J., which summarises  the  legal  position  with\nremarkable lucidity.  While I entirely agree with whatever is enunciated  in\nthe judgment proposed by my erudite colleague, I wish to add a few lines  of\nmy own confined to the proposition stated in Para 36 (IV) of  the  judgment.\nIn that paragraph of the order fall cases in which the  accused  setting  up\nthe plea of juvenility is  unable  to  produce  any  one  of  the  documents\nreferred to in Rule 12(3)(a) (i) to (iii) of the Rules, under the  Act,  not\nnecessarily because, he is deliberately withholding such documents from  the\ncourt, but because, he did not have the good fortune  of  ever  going  to  a\nschool from where he could produce  a  certificate  regarding  his  date  of\nbirth.  Para 36 (IV) sounds a note of caution that an affidavit of a  parent\nor a sibling or other relative would not ordinarily suffice, to  trigger  an\nenquiry  into  the  question  of  juvenility  of  the  accused,  unless  the\ncircumstances of the case are so glaring that the  court  is  left  with  no\noption except  to  record  a  prima  facie  satisfaction  that  a  case  for\ndirecting an enquiry is made out.  What would constitute  a  ‘glaring  case’\nin which an affidavit may itself be sufficient to direct an  inquiry,  is  a\nquestion that cannot be easily answered leave alone answered by  enumerating\nexhaustively the situations where an enquiry may be justified  even  in  the\nabsence of documentary support for the claim of juvenility.  Two  dimensions\nof that question may  all  the  same  be  mentioned  without  in  the  least\nconfining the sweep of the expression  ‘glaring  case’  to  a  strait-jacket\nformulation. The first of these factors is the most mundane  of  the  inputs\nthat go into consideration  while  answering  a  claim  of  juvenility  like\n“Physical Appearance” of the accused made relevant  by  Rule  12(2)  of  the\nRules framed under the Act.  The Rule reads:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">         “12. Procedure to be followed in determination of Age. –\n         (1)     xxxx\n         (2)      The Court or the Board or as the case may be the Committee\n         shall decide the juvenility or otherwise of  the  juvenile  or  the\n         child or as the case may be the   juvenile in  conflict  with  law,\n         prima facie on the basis of physical appearance  or  documents,  if\n         available, and send him to the observation home or in jail.”\n\n\n      Physical appearance of the accused is, therefore, a consideration that\nought to permeate every  determination  under  the  Rule  aforementioned  no\nmatter appearances are at times deceptive, and depend so much  on  the  race\nor the region to which the person concerned  belongs.   Physical  appearance\ncan and ought to give an idea to the Court at the stage  of  the  trial  and\neven in appeal before the High Court, whether the claim made by the  accused\nis so absurd or improbable that nothing short of documents  referred  to  in\nthis Rule 12 can satisfy the court  about  the  need  for  an  enquiry.  The\nadvantage  of  “physical  appearance”  of  the  accused  may,  however,   be\nsubstantially lost, with passage of time, as  longer  the  interval  between\nthe incident and the court’s decision on the  question  of  juvenility,  the\nlesser the chances of the court making a correct assessment of  the  age  of\nthe accused.  In cases where the claim is made in this Court for  the  first\ntime, the advantage is further reduced as there is considerable  time  lapse\nbetween the incident and the hearing of the matter by this Court.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">      The second factor which must ever remain present in the  mind  of  the\nCourt is that the claim of juvenility may at times be  made  even  in  cases\nwhere the accused does not have any evidence, showing his date of birth,  by\nreference to any public document like the register of births  maintained  by\nMunicipal Authorities, Panchayats or hospitals nor any certificate from  any\nschool, as the accused was never admitted to any school.  Even  if  admitted\nto a school no record regarding such admission may  at  times  be  available\nfor production in the Court.  Again there may be cases in which the  accused\nmay  not  be  in  a  position  to  provide  a  birth  certificate  from  the\nCorporation,  the  municipality  or  the  Panchayat,  for   we   know   that\nregistration of births and deaths may not be maintained  and  if  maintained\nmay not be regular and accurate, and at times truthful. Rule  12(3)  of  the\nRules makes only three certificates relevant. These are enumerated  in  Sub-\nRule 3(a)(i) to (iii) of the Rule which reads as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">         “(3)a    (i)  the  matriculation  or  equivalent  certificates,  if\n                  available; and in the absence whereof;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">            (ii)    the date of birth certificate  from  the  school  (other\n                  than a play school) first attended;  and  in  the  absence\n                  whereof;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">            (iii)  the  birth  certificate  given  by  a  corporation  or  a\n                  municipal authority or a panchayat;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">      Non-production of the above certificates or any one of  them  is  not,\nhowever, fatal to the claim of juvenility, for  Sub-Rule  3(b)  to  Rule  12\nmakes a provision for determination of the question  on  the  basis  of  the\nmedical examination of the accused in the  ‘absence’  of  the  certificates.\nRule 12(3)(b) runs as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">         “12(3)   (b) and only in the absence of either (i), (ii)  or  (iii)\n             of clause (a) above, the medical opinion will be sought from a\n             duly constituted Medical Board, which will declare the age  of\n             the juvenile or child.  In case exact assessment  of  the  age\n             cannot be done, the Court, or the Board or, as  the  case  may\n             be, the Committee, for the reasons to  be  recorded  by  them,\n             may, if considered necessary, give benefit  to  the  child  or\n             juvenile by considering his/her age on lower side  within  the\n             margin of one year.”\n\nThe expression ‘absence’ appearing in the above  provision  is  not  defined\nunder the Act or the Rules. The word shall, therefore, be given its  literal\ndictionary meaning which is provided by Concise Oxford dictionary as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">         “Being away from a place  or  person;  time  of  being  away;  non-\n         existence or lack of; inattenation due to thought of other things.”\n\n\n\nBlack’s Law Dictionary also explains the meaning of ‘absence’ as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">         “1. The state of being away from one’s usual place of residence. 2.\n         A failure to  appear,  or  to  be  available  and  reachable,  when\n         expected. 3. Louisiana Law. The State of being an absent  person  –\n         Also termed (in sense 3) absentia.”\n\n\n      It is axiomatic that the use of the  expression  and  the  context  in\nwhich the same has  been  used  strongly  suggests  that  ‘absence’  of  the\ndocuments mentioned in Rule 12(3) (a)(i) to (iii) may be either because  the\nsame do not exist or the same cannot be produced by the person relying  upon\nthem.  Mere non-production may not, therefore,  disentitle  the  accused  of\nthe benefit of the Act nor can it tantamount to  deliberate  non-production,\ngiving rise to an adverse inference unless the  Court  is  in  the  peculiar\nfacts and circumstances of a case of the opinion that the non-production  is\ndeliberate or intended to either mislead the Court or  suppress  the  truth.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">      It is in this class of cases that the court may have to  exercise  its\npowers and discretion with a certain amount of insight  into  the  realities\nof life.  One of such realities is that illiteracy and crime  have  a  close\nnexus though one may not be directly proportional to  the  other.   Juvenile\ndelinquency in this country as elsewhere in the world, springs from  poverty\nand unemployment, more than it does out of other causes. A large  number  of\nthose engaged in criminal activities, may never have had the opportunity  to\ngo to school. Studies conducted by National  Crime  Records  Bureau  (NCRB),\nMinistry of Home Affairs, reveal that poor education and poor  economic  set\nup are generally the main attributes of juvenile delinquents. Result of  the\n2011 study further show that out  of  33,887  juveniles  arrested  in  2011,\n55.8% were either illiterate (6,122)  or  educated  only  till  the  primary\nlevel (12,803). Further, 56.7% of the total  juveniles  arrested  fell  into\nthe lowest income category. A similar study is conducted  and  published  by\nB.N. Mishra in his Book ‘Juvenile Delinquency and Justice System’, in  which\nthe author states as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">         “One of the prominent features of a delinquent is poor  educational\n         attainment. More than 63 per cent of  delinquents  are  illiterate.\n         Poverty is the main cause of their illiteracy. Due to poor economic\n         condition they were compelled to enter into the  labour  market  to\n         supplement  their  family  income.  It  is  also  felt  that   poor\n         educational attainment is not due to the lack of  intelligence  but\n         may be due to lack  of  opportunity.  Although  free  education  is\n         provided to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, even  then,  the\n         delinquents had a very low level of  expectations  and  aspirations\n         regarding  their  future  which  in  turn  is  due   to   lack   of\n         encouragement and unawareness  of  their  parents  that  they  play\n         truant.”\n\n\n      What should then be the approach in such cases, is the question.   Can\nthe advantage of a beneficial legislation be denied to such unfortunate  and\nwayward delinquents? Can the misfortune of the  accused  never  going  to  a\nschool be  followed  or  compounded  by  denial  of  the  benefit  that  the\nlegislation provides in such emphatic terms, as to permit  an  enquiry  even\nafter the last Court has disposed of the appeal and upheld  his  conviction?\nThe answer has to be in the  negative.   If  one  were  to  adopt  a  wooden\napproach, one could say nothing short of a  certificate,  whether  from  the\nschool or a  municipal  authority  would  satisfy  the  court’s  conscience,\nbefore directing an enquiry.  But, then directing  an  enquiry  is  not  the\nsame thing as declaring the accused to  be  a  juvenile.   The  standard  of\nproof required is different for both.   In  the  former,  the  court  simply\nrecords a  prima  facie  conclusion.   In  the  latter  the  court  makes  a\ndeclaration on evidence, that it scrutinises  and  accepts  only  if  it  is\nworthy of such acceptance.  The approach  at  the  stage  of  directing  the\nenquiry has of necessity to  be  more  liberal,  lest,  there  is  avoidable\nmiscarriage of justice.  Suffice it to say that while affidavits may not  be\ngenerally accepted as a good enough basis for  directing  an  enquiry,  that\nthey are not so accepted is not a rule of law but a rule of  prudence.   The\nCourt would, therefore, in each case  weigh  the  relevant  factors,  insist\nupon filing of better affidavits if the need so  arises,  and  even  direct,\nany  additional  information  considered  relevant   including   information\nregarding the age of the parents, the age of siblings and the  like,  to  be\nfurnished before it decides on a case  to  case  basis  whether  or  not  an\nenquiry under Section 7A ought to be conducted. It  will  eventually  depend\non how the court evaluates such material for a prima facie  conclusion  that\nthe Court may or  may  not  direct  an  enquiry.  With  these  additions,  I\nrespectfully concur with  the  judgment  proposed  by  my  esteemed  Brother\nLodha J.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">                                                  ……………………………………….……….…..…J.\n                                                               (T.S.
