Granting power of review to this Court by\n\nthe   Constitution      is     in    recognition      of     the\n\nuniversal principle that the power of review is\n\npart of all judicial system.

As noticed above although Rule 1 of Order\n\n40 prohibits filing of review application in a\n\ncriminal    proceeding   except   on    the   ground   of\n\nerror apparent on the face of the record. The\n\nConstitution Bench of this Court has occasion\n\nagain to consider the ambit and scope of review\n\njurisdiction in    <a href=\"/doc/1461163/\" id=\"a_15\">P.N. Eswara Iyer and others\n\nvs. Registrar</a>, Supreme Court of India, (1980)\n\n4 SCC 680.     In <a href=\"/doc/1461163/\" id=\"a_16\">the above case</a> Order 40 Rule 3\n\nas amended in 1978 was under challenge. In the\n\nabove   context   this    Court   had     occasion     to\n\nconsider contour of the review jurisdiction and\n\nthe Constitution Bench speaking through Justice\n\nKrishna Iyer categorically held that although\n\nOrder 40 Rule 1 limits the ground viz-a-viz\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                        9</span>\n\n\ncriminal proceedings to errors apparent on the\n\nface of the record but the power to review in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 137</a> is wide and framers of the rules\n\nnever   intended   a   restrictive   review     over\n\ncriminal orders or judgments. In paragraphs 34\n\nand 35 following was laid down:</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">           “34. The rule, on its face,\n         affords a wider set of grounds for\n         review   for    orders   in    civil\n         proceedings, but limits the ground\n         vis-a-vis criminal proceedings to\n         “errors apparent on the face of\n         the record”. If at all, the\n         concern of the law to avoid\n         judicial     error     should     be\n         heightened when life or liberty is\n         in peril since civil penalties are\n         often less traumatic. So, it is\n         reasonable to assume that the\n         framers of the rules could not\n         have intended a restrictive review\n         over criminal orders or judgments.\n         It is likely to be the other way\n         about. Supposing an accused is\n         sentenced to death by the Supreme\n         Court and the “deceased” shows up\n         in court and the court discovers\n         the   tragic   treachery    of   the\n         recorded testimony. Is the court\n         helpless to review and set aside\n         the sentence of hanging? We think\n         not. The power to review is in\n         <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 137</a> and it is equally wide\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">\f              10</span>\n\n\nin   all  proceedings.   The   rule\nmerely canalises the flow from the\nreservoir of power. The stream\ncannot    stifle    the     source.\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">Moreover,    the    dynamics     of\ninterpretation   depend   on    the\n</pre><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">demand of the context and the\nlexical limits of the test. Here\n“record” means any material which\nis already on record or may, with\nthe permission of the court, be\nbrought on record. If justice\nsummons the Judges to allow a\nvital material in, it becomes part\nof the record; and if apparent\nerror is there, correction becomes\nnecessitous.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">  35. The purpose is plain, the\nlanguage     is     elastic      and\ninterpretation   of   a    necessary\npower must naturally be expansive.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">The substantive power is derived\nfrom <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 137</a> and is as wide\nfor   criminal    as    for    civil\nproceedings. Even the difference\nin phraseology in the rule (Order\n40 Rule 2) must, therefore, be\nread to encompass the same area\nand not to engraft an artificial\ndivergence productive of anomaly.\nIf the expression “record” is read\nto mean, in its semantic sweep,\nany material even later brought on\nrecord, with the leave of the\ncourt, it will embrace subsequent\nevents,   new   light    and   other\ngrounds which we find in Order 47\nRule 1, <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_20\">CPC</a>.

The    conviction         against        the\n\napplicants       under      Section       302     and     364A       was\n\nrecorded after considering entire evidence on\n\nrecord.

It is\n\nsubmitted   that      since    this   Court    recorded   at\n\npara 18 that the said cars belong to Vikram\n\nSingh, the existence of finger prints cannot by\n\nitself be of any significance with regard to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">\f                             35</span>\n\n\nhis culpability in the crime.

The     above    submission   of   learned\n\ncounsel is misconceived and incorrect.              In para\n\n18 of the judgment this Court never observed\n\nthat Alto and Chevrolet cars belonged to Vikram\n\nSingh. The statement of facts made in para 18\n\nwas to the effect that the finger prints from\n\nthe Alto and Chevrolet cars belong to Vikram\n\nSingh    and    Jasvir    Singh    respectively.     It    is\n\nuseful    to    extract     below     para     18   of    the\n\njudgment:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">          “18.
