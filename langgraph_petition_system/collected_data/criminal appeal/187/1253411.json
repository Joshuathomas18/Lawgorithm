Under <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 23</a> of the \nConvention, traffic in human beings is \nprohibited and any contravention of the \nprohibition is an offence punishable by \nlaw.  Under <a href=\"/doc/448465/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 35</a> such a law has to be \npassed by Parliament as soon as may be \nafter the commencement of the \nConstitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">(2)\tLegislation on the subject of suppression \nof immoral traffic does exist in a few States \nbut the laws are neither uniform nor do \nthey go far enough.  In the remaining \nStates there is no bar on the subject at all.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(3)\tIn the circumstances it is necessary and \ndesirable that a Central Law should be \npassed which will not only secure \nuniformity but also would be sufficiently \ndeterrent for the purpose.  But a special \nfeature of the Bill as that it provides that \nno person or authority other than the \nState Government shall establish or \nmaintain any protective home except \nunder a licence issued by the State \nGovernment.  This will check the \nestablishment of homes which are really \ndens for prostitution.\t\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_5\">\t\tAs the problem of trafficking of minor girls and \nwomen in the metropolitan city of Bombay was on the increase \nin an epidemic form, the State of Maharashtra issued a \nNotification NO.PPA-0199/778/CR-10/POL-8 dated 1.10.1999 \nconferring on the Commissioner of Police, Brihan Bombay, the \npowers of District Magistrate within the metropolitan area of \nBrihan Bombay, for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/10767096/\" id=\"a_4\">Sections 18</a> and <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_5\">20</a> of the \nAct.

On 15.4.2004 the respondent \nherein replied to the show cause notice.  After examining the \nreply to the show cause notice an eviction order was passed \nagainst the respondent by an order dated 28.6.2004.  Being \naggrieved by the order of eviction the respondents herein filed \na Writ Petition No. 1333 of 2004 challenging the order dated \n28.6.2004 as bad in law.  The High Court by its impugned \norder dated 6.5.2005 set aside the order dated 28.6.2004 of \nthe Commissioner of Police and held that the Notification \ndated 1.10.1999 pursuant to which the order of eviction was \npassed was ab initio bad in law.   According to the High Court, \naforesaid Notification does not empower the Police \nCommissioner, Bombay to assume the jurisdiction of the \nDistrict Magistrate for the purposes of <a href=\"/doc/10767096/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections 18</a> and <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_9\">20</a> of \nthe Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\"> \t        We have heard the parties at length.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\t\tThe whole controversy boils down to this issue, as \nto whether the Notification dated 1.10.1999 issued by the \nState of Maharashtra empowering the Commissioner of Police, \nBrihan Bombay, the powers of District Magistrate for the \npurposes of <a href=\"/doc/10767096/\" id=\"a_10\">Sections 18</a> and <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_11\">20</a> of the Act, has been validly \nmade?       \n</p>\t\t\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\tThe important questions of law involved in these \nappeals are common and they are being disposed by this \ncommon order.       \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">       To answer the aforesaid question it will be necessary \nto notice the Notification itself.  The Notification dated \n1.10.1999 reads:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">&quot;In exercise of the powers conferred by sub-\nsection (5) read with sub-sections (1) and (2) of \n<a href=\"/doc/1670661/\" id=\"a_12\">section 20</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, \n1973(2 of 1974), and of all other powers \nenabling it in that behalf, the Government of \nMaharashtra hereby confers on the \nCommissioner of Police, Brihan Mumbai, the \npowers of the District Magistrate, within the \nmetropolitan area of Brihan Mumbai, for the \npurposes of <a href=\"/doc/10767096/\" id=\"a_13\">sections 18</a> and <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_14\">20</a> of the Immoral \nTraffic (Prevention) Act, 1956 (104 of 1956).&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">        From the Notification, it clearly appears that the \nState of Maharashtra invoked the power conferred upon the \nState by sub-<a href=\"/doc/120962339/\" id=\"a_15\">section 5</a> read with sub-section (1) and (2) of \n<a href=\"/doc/1670661/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 20</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure. \n\t\t<a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 20</a> of the Code is extracted in extenso:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">20.

Under any \nlaw for the time being in force, on a \nCommissioner of Police, all or any of the \npowers of an Executive Magistrate in relation \nto a metropolitan area.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">\t\t<a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 20</a> as quoted above plainly consists of three \nparts.  The first part deals with the power of the State \nGovernment to appoint as many persons as it thinks fit to be \nExecutive Magistrates and to appoint one of them to be the \nDistrict Magistrate.  The second part empowers the State \nGovernment to appoint any Executive Magistrate to be an \nAdditional District Magistrate and such Magistrate shall have \nthe powers of a District Magistrate under the Code or under \nany other law for the time being in force as may be directed by \nthe Government.  The third part is sub-section (5) of <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_19\">Section \n20</a> which empowers the State Government for conferring \nunder any law for the time being in force, on a Commissioner \nof Police, all or any of the powers of an Executive Magistrate in \nrelation to a metropolitan area.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">\t\tWe may at this stage clarify that the admitted \nposition is that Brihan Bombay is a metropolitan area.        \n\t\tThe main thrust of arguments of Mr. UU Lalit, \nlearned senior counsel for the appellants, is that the State \nGovernment issued a Notification in exercise of Powers under \nsub-section (5) read with sub-sections (1) and (2) of Section \n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">20.  Therefore, the provisions of sub-sections (1) and (2) of the \nCode shall be deemed to have been complied with and the \nHigh Court has erred in law in setting aside the Notification for \nnon compliance of sub-sections (1) and (2) of <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 20</a>.\n\t\tPer contra learned counsel for the respondents \ncontended that unless a person is appointed as an Executive \nMagistrate by virtue of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 20</a> he cannot \nbe conferred powers of Additional District Magistrate under \nsub-Section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 20</a>. It is further contended by the \ncounsel that the powers of State Government conferred by \nsub-section (5) of the Code only speak about conferring on \nCommissioner of Police powers of the Executive Magistrate \nand not the District Magistrate and, therefore, the \nCommissioner of Police cannot act as a District Magistrate for \nthe purposes of <a href=\"/doc/10767096/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections 18</a> and <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_24\">20</a> of the Act and therefore, \nthe High Court has rightly set aside the Notification as ab initio \nbad in law.  It is further contended that the Commissioner of \nPolice cannot be appointed as an Executive Magistrate under \nsub-sections (1) and (2) of the Code in view of specific \nprovision made in sub-section (5) of the Code. \n\t\tWe may at this stage notice the view taken by the \nHigh Court while setting aside the Notification.  In paragraph \n11 the High Court has stated as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">&quot;Very fact that in case of Commissioner of \nPolice and that too restricted in the \nmetropolitan area, a specific provision has \nbeen made in sub-section (5) inspite of a \ngeneral provision being there in sub-section (1) \nempowering the State Government to appoint \nany person as an Executive Magistrate, that \nitself discloses the intention of the Legislature \nto classify the Commissioner of Police to be \ndifferent from the person who can be \nappointed as an Executive Magistrate in \nexercise of the powers under sub-section (1).  \nOtherwise, there was absolutely no need of \nincorporating a specific provision under sub-\nsection (5) in relation to Commissioner of \nPolice.  Otherwise, even in the absence of sub-\nsection (5) a Commissioner of Police could \nhave been appointed as an Executive \nMagistrate.  The Legislature in its wisdom, \nhowever, has excluded the office of the \nCommissioner of Police under sub-section (1) \nwhile reserving the power to the State \nGovernment to confer the powers of an \nExecutive Magistrate upon the Commissioner \nof Police in relation to a metropolitan area.  In \nother words, it discloses that in case of the \noffice of the Commissioner of Police only all or \nany of the powers of an Executive Magistrate \ncan be conferred upon him and that too in \nrelation to a metropolitan area but the \nCommissioner of Police cannot be appointed as \nan Executive Magistrate.  The appointment of \na person in an office is different from the \nconferment of powers attached to an office \nupon the person.  In fact the decision sought \nto be relied up by the learned A.P.P., rather \nthan assisting the contention on the part of \nthe respondents, justifies the view that we are \ntaking in the matter. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">In paragraph 17 it is stated as under:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">&quot;Plain reading of the said Notification discloses \nthat undoubtedly the Government was seeking \nto exercise the powers under sub-section (5) r/w \nsub-section (1) and (2) of <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 20</a> of the Code \nto confer upon the Commissioner of Police the \npowers of the District Magistrate within the \nmetropolitan area of Brihan Mumbai for the \npurpose of <a href=\"/doc/10767096/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 18</a> of the said Act.  However, \nas already seen above, the provisions of law \ncomprised under <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 20</a> of the Code no \nwhere speak of the Government being \nempowered to confer the powers of the District \nMagistrate upon the Police Commissioner either \nin any metropolitan area or otherwise.  On the \ncontrary, sub-section (1) specifically restricts \nthe appointment of District Magistrate from \namongst the Executive Magistrates.  The sub-\nsection (2) relates to the appointment of an \nAdditional District Magistrate and that too any \none of the Executive Magistrates and the sub-\nsection (5) merely speaks of conferment of \npowers of an Executive Magistrate.  The \nNotification no where discloses either \nconferment of the powers of the Executive \nMagistrate or even the appointment of the Police \nCommissioner as the Executive Magistrate.  As \nalready stated, there cannot be appointment of \nDistrict Magistrate unless the person is \nprimarily an Executive Magistrate.  It is settled \nlaw that when the statute defines the limits of \nthe power that can be conferred upon a specific \nofficer, the conferment of power has to be within \nthe parameters prescribed under the statute. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">             The High Court after expressing its views in \nparagraphs 11 and 17 as quoted above came to the following \nfindings:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">&quot;i)  The District Magistrate or the Additional \nDistrict Magistrate can be appointed out of the \nExecutive Magistrate so appointed under \n<a href=\"/doc/61647221/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 20(1)</a> of the Code.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">ii) The Additional District Magistrate can \nexercise the powers of the District Magistrate \nto the extent directed by the State \nGovernment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">iii) Unless a person is appointed as an \nExecutive Magistrate, he can neither be \nappointed as a District Magistrate nor an \nAdditional District Magistrate. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">iv) In relation to a metropolitan area the \npowers of an Executive Magistrate can be \nconferred upon the Commissioner of Police. \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">v) The State Government&#x27;s power to appoint \nany person as an Executive Magistrate in \nterms of the provisions of law under sub-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 20</a> of the Code does not \ninclude the power to appoint the \nCommissioner of Police as an Executive \nMagistrate. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">vi) As far as the Commissioner of Police is \nconcerned, he can only be conferred with the \npowers of the Executive Magistrate in terms of \nsub-section (5) of <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 20</a> of the Code but is \nnot entitled to be appointed even as an \nExecutive Magistrate under sub-section (1) of \n<a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 20</a> of the Code. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">vii) The District Magistrate, Additional District \nMagistrate and the Executive Magistrate are \nthree different offices. \n</p>\n\t\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">\t \tWe have already noticed the provisions of sub-\nsection (1) and (2) of <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 20</a> of the Code.  Sub-section (1) \ndeals with the power of the State Government to appoint \nExecutive Magistrates as many persons as it thinks fit in every \ndistrict and in every metropolitan area.  Sub-section (2) of \n<a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 20</a> deals with the power of the State Government to \nappoint any Executive Magistrate to be an Additional District \nMagistrate and such Magistrate shall have the powers of a \nDistrict Magistrate under the Code or under any other law for \nthe time being in force as may be directed by the State \nGovernment.    We agree with the view of the High Court that \nunless a person is appointed as an Executive Magistrate he \ncannot be appointed as either an Additional District \nMagistrate or the District Magistrate.   To this extent, the High \nCourt&#x27;s view is correct.  But the views of the High Court \ncontained in sub clause V and VI of the findings, in our view, \nare not correct.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">\t\t Under sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 20</a> the \nGovernment has got the power to appoint as many persons as \nit thinks fit to be Executive Magistrates in every district and in \nevery metropolitan area and shall appoint one of them to be \nthe District Magistrate.  The words, &quot;as many persons&quot; \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">employed in sub-section (1) are adequately elastic to include \nthe Commissioner of Police.  In other words, the State \nGovernment is not precluded from appointing the \nCommissioner of Police in metropolitan area as an Executive \nMagistrate.  We have already noted that Brihan Bombay is a \nmetropolitan area.  Once the Commissioner of Police is \nappointed as an Executive Magistrate in Brihan Bombay, he \ncan be appointed as an Additional District Magistrate, who \nshall have the powers of the District Magistrate for the \npurposes of <a href=\"/doc/10767096/\" id=\"a_35\">Sections 18</a> and <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_36\">20</a> of the Act.  In our opinion, this \nwould be the correct reading of the statute.  This view of ours \nis further clarified by sub-section (5) of <a href=\"/doc/182145335/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 20</a> when it is \nstated that nothing in this section shall preclude the State \nGovernment from conferring under any law for the time being \nin force, on Commissioner of Police, all or any of the powers of \nan Executive Magistrate in relation to a metropolitan area.  \n\t\tIt is now well settled principle of law that the Court \ncannot enlarge the scope of legislation or intention when the \nlanguage of the statute is plain and unambiguous. Narrow and \npedantic construction may not always be given effect to. \nCourts should avoid a construction, which would reduce the \nlegislation to futility. It is also well settled that every statute is \nto be interpreted without any violence to its language. It is also \ntrite that when an expression is capable of more than one \nmeaning, the court would attempt to resolve the ambiguity in \na manner consistent with the purpose of the provision, having \nregard to the great consequences of the alternative \nconstructions. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"792222\" id=\"span_1\">In <a href=\"/doc/792222/\" id=\"a_38\">Anwar Hasan Khan v.
