Pappu alias Satendra      the appellant of Criminal\n\nAppeal No.1875/2007 and Deenu alias Dinesh appellant of\n\nCriminal Appeal No.1937/2007 have preferred the present\n\nappeals being aggrieved with the aforesaid judgment whereby,\n\neach of them has been convicted of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections\n\n302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_2\">364</a> and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_3\">201</a> of I.P.C and sentenced to life imprisonment\n\nwith fine of Rs.500/-, five years rigorous imprisonment with\n\nfine of Rs.500/- and three years rigorous imprisonment with\n\nfine of Rs.500/-, respectively and default sentence has also\n\nbeen prescribed in case of non-payment of fine.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">3.         In Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008 the State has\n\npreferred the present appeal against the appellants Pappu\n\nalias Satendra, Deenu alias Dinesh and the respondent no.3\n\nSarika Patel against the judgment of acquittal passed by the\n\ntrial Court relating to offence under Section 120-B of I.P.C.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.         Facts of the case in short are that the marriage of\n\nrespondent no.3 Sarika Patel took place with the deceased\n\nPraveen on 8.5.2006.       Sarika was posted as contractual\n\nAssistant Teacher Grade III in a School at Village Dungariya.\n\nThe deceased Praveen was visiting Dungariya as and when it\n\nwas required.     On 9.7.2006 Sarika had to appear in D.Ed.\n\nExamination at School of Excellence, Kevlari and therefore,\n\nthe deceased Praveen went on his motorcycle to Village\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                3</span>\n\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nDungariya and took his wife Sarika to Village Kevlari on\n\nmotorcycle.    At about 9.00 a.m in the morning Sarika went\n\ninside the school for her examination        and the deceased\n\nPraveen along with his motorcycle remained outside             the\n\nschool. On completion of first paper when Sarika came out of\n\nthe school, she found that motorcycle of deceased Praveen\n\nwas lying in front of the school but Praveen was not present.\n\nAt about 2.00 p.m again Sarika went inside the school for her\n\nsecond examination paper and at about 5.00 p.m she came\n\nback, but she found that motorcycle of the deceased Praveen\n\nwas lying in front of the School, but Praveen was not present.\n\nSarika stayed there up to 6.00 p.m.    Thereafter, she informed\n\nher father Nathuram Patel (DW1).      Nathuram Patel informed\n\nRamaiyalal Patel (PW3), father of the deceased Praveen.        On\n\n10.7.2006 Sarika submitted a written missing report Ex.P/1 at\n\nPolice Station Kevlari (District Seoni).    Again on 11.7.2006\n\nRamaiyalal Patel (PW3) had lodged a complaint Ex.P/7 about\n\nhis missing son Praveen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.        On    12.7.2006   the    Inspector    S.   K.    Maravi\n\ninterrogated the appellants Satendra alias Pappu and Deenu\n\nalias Dinesh   and recorded memo under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 27</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act Ex.P/11 and Ex.P/13 respectively.                The\n\nappellants Satendra    and Dinesh had confessed about the\n\ncrime and they intimated about their clothes, weapons of\n\noffence etc.    Such confession was done by the appellants\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                               4</span>\n\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nbefore Umesh Kumar Shrivas (PW7), Shiv Bharti (PW9) and\n\nRajendra alias Raju (PW18).       Thereafter,    Inspector S. K.\n\nMaravi went to the place where the dead body of the deceased\n\nPraveen was lying.   A memo Ex.P/16 of recovery of the dead\n\nbody was prepared and the dead body was identified by\n\nRamaiyalal (PW3) and one Kuber Singh on the basis of clothes\n\nand other articles found with the dead body.     Dr. R. K. Rawat\n\n(PW21) who was posted at Community Health Centre, Kevlari\n\nwas called to the spot to perform the post mortem. Dr. Rawat\n\nwith the help of sweeper Guddu alias Santlal (PW16)\n\nperformed post mortem on the body of deceased Praveen and\n\ngave his report Ex.P/31.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">6.        The body was highly decomposed and therefore,\n\nvarious injuries could not be ascertained.      According to Dr.\n\nRawat the time of death could be anytime within         2-7 days.\n\nHowever, one incised wound was found on the left side of the\n\nneck and all major blood vessels were found cut. There was a\n\nfracture on the right mandible bone.    According to Dr. Rawat\n\nthe deceased died due to injuries caused to him        especially\n\ndue to cut of major blood vessels on the neck and death of the\n\ndeceased was homicidal in nature.        Inspector S.K Maravi\n\nthereafter, registered a case and seized various articles from\n\nthe appellants Satendra and Dinesh including their clothes,\n\nweapon of offence etc. and prepared seizure memo Ex.P/15\n\nand P/14 respectively.     He recorded evidence of various\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                5</span>\n\n                                      Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                      Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                      Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nwitnesses and sent the seized articles to Forensic Science\n\nLaboratory for their forensic analysis. After due investigation\n\na charge sheet was filed before the JMFC, Seoni who\n\ncommitted the case to the Court of Sessions and ultimately it\n\nwas transferred to Third Additional Sessions Judge, Seoni.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">7.         Appellants Satendra , Dinesh and respondent no.3\n\nSarika Patel have abjured their guilt.      Appellants Satyenda\n\nand Dinesh did not take any specific plea in the case.\n\nHowever,    they have stated that they were falsely implicated.\n\nOn the other hand Sarika Patel did not take any specific plea,\n\nbut she examined the witnesses Nathuram Patel (DW1) and\n\nTeksingh Rajput (DW2) to show that she had good relations\n\nwith the deceased and she had no connection with the\n\nappellant Satendra .   She was interested to get her transfer\n\nfrom Dungariya and she was not at all involved in the crime.\n\nThe   Additional   Sessions   Judge   after    considering    the\n\nprosecution&#x27;s evidence acquitted all the accused persons from\n\nthe charge of <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_5\">section 120-B</a> of I.P.C, but convicted and\n\nsentenced the appellants as mentioned above.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">8.         Appellant   Satendra        of     Criminal     Appeal\n\nNo.1875/2007 has filed an SLP (Criminal) No.21571/2014 for\n\ngrant of bail and suspension of sentence.      Vide order dated\n\n7.11.2014 the Apex Court rejected his application with\n\nfollowing observations :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           &quot;We see no reason to interfere with the\n           impugned order.

Since    the\n             petitioner   has already         undergone nearly\n             eight years of imprisonment, we request the\n             High Court to make an endeavour to dispose\n             of the appeal at an early date preferably\n             within a period of one year from today.&quot;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">Hence these appeals are finally heard out of turn.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">9.           We have heard the learned counsel for the parties\n\nat length.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">10.          The     present     case    is    dependent     upon     the\n\ncircumstantial evidence.         There is no eye witness in the case\n\nand therefore, it would be appropriate to deal with each\n\ncircumstance one by one. The first circumstance in the case is\n\nthat whether the death of the deceased was homicidal in\n\nnature? In this connection Ramaiyalal Patel (PW3) and\n\nNathuram Patel (DW1) have stated that Sarika informed them\n\nthat after leaving her at the School of Excellence the deceased\n\nPraveen disappeared.      When Sarika came out after completion\n\nof her first examination paper the deceased was not present\n\nthough his motorcycle was lying in front of the school.             Again\n\nwhen she came back at about 5.00 p.m after completion of her\n\nsecond examination paper the deceased Praveen was missing\n\nand his motorcycle was lying in front of the school and\n\ntherefore, on the next day Sarika had lodged a written missing\n\nreport Ex.P/1.     Again on the third day Ramaiyalal Patel (PW3),\n\nfather of the deceased Praveen, had lodged a complaint Ex.P/7\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                      7</span>\n\n                                             Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                             Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                             Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nabout missing of Praveen.        It is also clear from the evidence of\n\nthe parties that dead body of the deceased was found near a\n\nforest road and it was recovered by Inspector             S. K. Maravi\n\nwith a recovery memo Ex.P/16.            It is also admitted that body\n\nwas putrefied and it could not be identified by the face but\n\nwith articles like clothes of the deceased, a watch, driving\n\nlicense, three passport size photographs, key of the motorcycle\n\nand sandal found with the dead body, the deceased Praveen\n\ncould be identified.         None of the party has challenged the\n\nidentification   of    the    dead   body    and   therefore,   it   was\n\nestablished that the dead body recovered by Inspector S. K.\n\nMaravi was of the deceased Praveen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">11.        Dr. R. K. Rawat (PW21) after performing the post\n\nmortem on the body gave a report Ex.P/13.            According to him\n\nthe deceased would have died due to various injuries caused to\n\nhim.    He found an incised wound on the left neck of the\n\ndeceased Praveen.         Various major blood vessel of that place\n\nwere found cut.         One fracture was also found on his right\n\nmandible bone.        According to Dr. Rawat death of the deceased\n\nPraveen was homicidal in nature.            The deceased would have\n\ndied within 2-7 days.        The information given by Dr. Rawat has\n\nnot been challenged by any of the party in the case and\n\ntherefore, it is proved that the death of the deceased Praveen\n\nwas homicidal in nature.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                  8</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">                                           Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                           Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                           Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">12.        The second circumstance relates to motive of the\n\naccused persons.     Such motive as alleged by the prosecution\n\nfalls in two different categories.    It is alleged that the accused\n\nSarika was in love with the appellant Satendra and she gave a\n\nsum of Rs.5000/- to the appellant Satendra                to kill the\n\ndeceased Praveen and thereafter, the appellant Satendra with\n\nthe help of appellant Dinesh killed the deceased.        This part of\n\nmotive also relates to accused Sarika for offence under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_6\">Section\n\n120-B</a> of I.P.C. Second part of motive, allegedly is that Sarika\n\ntold the deceased Praveen to bring a pass book of some\n\nscheme from the appellant Satendra and when the deceased\n\nPraveen went to ask for the pass book Satendra              denied to\n\ndeliver the same and ultimately he gave the pass book to the\n\ndeceased Praveen by throwing the same and therefore, there\n\nwas enmity between Satendra and the deceased Praveen. So\n\nfar as the first part of motive is concerned the prosecution has\n\nexamined so many witnesses.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">13.        Out of them one Yashwant Kumar (PW4) was\n\nexamined to show that uncle of the appellant Satendra asked\n\nthe witness Yashwant Kumar           about the residential place of\n\nNathuram Patel (DW1), father of Sarika so that a talk relating\n\nto proposed marriage of Sarika and Satendra could be done.\n\nHowever, Yashwant Kumar has accepted that such incident\n\ntook place one month prior to the marriage of Sarika.\n\nAccording to Ramaiyalal Patel (PW3) the negotiations relating\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                 9</span>\n\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nto marriage of Praveen and Sarika were going on for last one\n\nyear   and thereafter the marriage was performed peacefully.\n\nIt was not indicative from the behavior of Sarika that she was\n\nin love with someone else or she was not ready to marry the\n\ndeceased Praveen.      When the witness Yashwant Kumar was\n\nasked in detail then he could not state the name of that uncle\n\nof the appellant Satendra,    who came to enquire about the\n\naddress of Nathuram Patel.     Yashwant Kumar is a Pan Shop\n\nVendor and with so many customers and visitors, he could not\n\npossibly remember about a particular customer who came to\n\nhis shop, that too for so many months       till the date of his\n\nstatement.     Still if uncle of appellant Satendra went to the\n\nhouse of Sarika for negotiations relating to marriage of Sarika\n\nwith the appellant Satendra then such a fact does not indicate\n\nthat Sarika was in love with the appellant Satendra or she was\n\nan unwilling party to marry with the deceased Praveen.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">14.          It was for the prosecution to prove that after her\n\nmarriage with the deceased Praveen, she was interested in\n\nkilling her husband because she was in a love affair with the\n\nappellant Satendra.       In this context the prosecution has\n\nexamined Sukchain (PW5), Smt.

Principal Smt.\n\nIndira Uikey has denied that the appellant Satendra          was\n\nmeeting with the accused Sarika in the school.       Hence, the\n\nprosecution has failed to prove that the accused Sarika had\n\nany relation with the appellant Satendra.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"254499\" id=\"span_10\">15.        It was alleged against the accused Sarika that she\n\nhad given a sum of Rs.5000/- to the appellant Satendra to kill\n\nthe deceased Praveen.    In this connection the prosecution has\n\nproved a memo under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act Ex.P/11\n\ngiven by the appellant Satendra in which it was told that he\n\ntook a sum of Rs.5000/- from the accused Sarika and he gave a\n\nsum of Rs.500/- to the appellant Dinesh and he gave a\n\nstatement that he was ready to produce the remaining sum of\n\nRs.4500/- and thereafter, a sum of Rs.4500/- was recovered by\n\nInspector S. K.      Maravi with the seizure memo Ex.P/15.\n\nHowever, in this connection a judgment passed by the Apex\n\nCourt in the case of &quot;<a href=\"/doc/254499/\" id=\"a_8\">Babboo Vs.

It is observed in that judgment that the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                 11</span>\n\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nfirst part of the memo that the accused assaulted with a\n\nparticular weapon would be inadmissible because it hits the\n\nprovision of <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act whereas the\n\ndiscovery of the weapon may be admitted.     Hence. In the light\n\nof aforesaid judgment in memo Ex.P/11 only that part is\n\nadmissible in which the appellant Satendra has stated that he\n\nkept a sum of Rs.4500/- in cash box of his shop.           Umesh\n\nKumar Shrivas (PW7) a witness of memo Ex.P/11 and seizure\n\nMemo Ex.P/15 has accepted that a sum of Rs.4500/- was\n\nhanded over by the appellant Satendra to the Inspector S. K.\n\nMaravi from the cash box of his shop.        If the evidence of\n\nInspector S. K. Maravi and Umesh Shrivas is accepted as it is\n\nthen it was proved that the appellant Satendra gave a sum of\n\nRs.4500/- to the Police from the cash box of his shop, but it was\n\nfor the prosecution to prove that such sum was given by the\n\naccused Sarika to the appellant Satendra.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"254499\" id=\"span_12\">16.        The basis of assumptions by the Police regarding\n\nmotive are contradictory.   On one hand it is alleged that the\n\nappellant Satendra was in love with the accused Sarika and on\n\nother hand it was alleged that the appellant Satendra took a\n\nsum of Rs.5000/- to kill the deceased Praveen. If the appellant\n\nSatendra was in a love affair with the deceased Sarika then he\n\ncould kill the deceased Praveen on his own to marry the\n\naccused Sarika thereafter and <a href=\"/doc/254499/\" id=\"a_11\">in that case</a> it was in his own\n\ninterest to kill the deceased Praveen and there was no need for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                12</span>\n\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nhim to take a sum of Rs.5000/- from the accused Sarika and if\n\nhe was not in a love affair with the accused Sarika then no\n\nreason has been shown by the prosecution as to why the\n\naccused Sarika selected the appellant Satendra for murder of\n\nher own husband Praveen.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">17.          Ramaiyalal (PW3), father-in-law of the accused,\n\nSarika has accepted that Sarika was already employed in the\n\nSchool of Dungariya prior to her marriage.     She was married\n\nwith the deceased Praveen without any hesitation or any\n\ndenial.   After her marriage she was visiting Village Mand\n\nwhere Praveen and Ramailyalal were residing.       At Dungariya,\n\nthe place of posting of the accused Sarika, she kept her grand\n\nmother with her and Ramaiyalal was readily sending his wife\n\nto stay with the accused Sarika at Dungariya so that she could\n\nbe helped.    Ramaiyalal has also accepted that Sarika had told\n\nabout her problems at Dungariya when she was scared of the\n\nplace due to some      antisocial elements and she was also\n\ninterested to get her transfer from Village Dungariya.        The\n\nmost important admission was done by witness Ramaiyalal that\n\nthe accused Sarika did not get her salary for 4-5 months and\n\ntherefore, he gave a sum of Rs.1000/- to the accused Sarika on\n\ncredit so that she could prosecute her life at Village Dungariya.\n\nIn such circumstances, the prosecution could not prove that\n\nthe accused Sarika was in a position to give a sum of Rs.5000/-\n\nto the appellant Satendra for killing of her husband Praveen.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                 13</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">                                          Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                          Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                          Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">18.         On the basis of the evidence given by Ramaiyalal\n\n(PW3), Manoj Kumar (PW1) and Vishnu Prasad Tekam (PW2)\n\nrelations of the accused Sarika were good with the deceased\n\nPraveen and his family members.         No incident of any quarrel\n\ntook place between them. Ramaiyalal Patel (PW3), father-in-\n\nlaw of accused Sarika, gave some money to Sarika so that she\n\ncould live comfortably at Village Dungariya.         No witness of\n\nVillage Dungariya has stated that the accused Sarika ever met\n\nwith Satendra during her posting at Dungariya.            Nathuram\n\nPatel (DW1) has submitted some documents to show that the\n\naccused Sarika was interested to get her transfer away from\n\nVillage Dungariya.      If she was   interested in the appellant\n\nSatendra    then she could be interested to continue with her\n\nposting at Dungariya. Hence, neither it is proved that she was\n\ninterested to get her husband Praveen to be killed nor she had\n\nany sum so that she could give a sum of Rs.5000/- to the\n\nappellant Satendra for killing of her husband Praveen.           The\n\ntrial Court has rightly acquitted all the accused persons from\n\nthe charge of Section 120-B of I.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">19.         So far as the second part of motive is concerned, it\n\nis alleged that Sarika was a Secretary of Parent &amp; Teachers\n\nAssociation of that School and Sannilal was President of that\n\nAssociation.      The payments of construction done in that\n\nscheme could be made with the joint signature of Sannilal and\n\nSarika.    It is alleged that Sarika sent the deceased Praveen to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                               14</span>\n\n                                     Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                     Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                     Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nget the pass book of the transaction from the appellant\n\nSatendra, who denied to give that pass book to the deceased\n\nPraveen and thereafter, he threw the pass book upon the\n\ndeceased Praveen with a threat.    However, no witness could\n\nbe examined by the prosecution to prove such allegation.\n\nRamaiyalal (PW3) has stated that Praveen told him about such\n\nfacts.   However, such statement of Ramaiyalal can not be\n\nadmitted for proof of these facts because those are not\n\nadmissible under <a href=\"/doc/1959734/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 32</a> of the Evidence Act.    Also in the\n\ncomplaint Ex.P/7 Ramaiyalal has narrated the story relating to\n\nquarrel between Sannilal and the deceased Praveen.       It was\n\nnot mentioned in the document Ex.P/7 that a quarrel relating\n\nto handing over the pass book took place between the\n\nappellant Satendra   and the deceased Praveen.     Sannilal was\n\nnot examined by the Police to show that he gave the pass book\n\nto the appellant Satendra.   Similarly, no document has been\n\nfiled to show that contract of such construction was given to\n\nthe appellant Satendra   and he had received the pass book\n\nfrom Sannilal, the President of Parents Teachers Association.\n\nOn the other hand Smt. Indira Uikey (PW6) has produced that\n\npass book to the Police and it was seized by a seizure memo\n\nEx.P/9. Smt. Indira Uikey was never asked as to whether the\n\npass book was ever handed over to the appellant Satendra.\n\nShe has accepted that the pass book was not available and\n\nwhen it was demanded from Sannilal he assured that it will be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                15</span>\n\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\ngiven.     Smt. Indira Uikey has denied that the work of\n\nconstruction of lavatory was given to the appellant Satendra.\n\nShe has also stated that at the time of alleged quarrel,\n\nconstruction was not complete and therefore, there was no\n\nquestion of payment of any amount to the Contractor.        Under\n\nthese circumstances, the prosecution could not prove that any\n\nquarrel took place between the deceased Praveen and the\n\nappellant Satendra.    Hence, the prosecution could not prove\n\nany motive with the appellants or the accused Sarika to kill the\n\ndeceased Praveen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1210867\" id=\"span_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"408848\" id=\"span_18\">20.        It is the settled view of the Apex Court that motive\n\nis not an essential ingredient in a chain of circumstantial\n\nevidence   to prove a case of murder. Sometimes no one can\n\nimagine about the motive to kill the person and therefore, if\n\nmotive is proved then it can be considered as an additional\n\ningredient in chain of circumstantial evidence, but if chain is\n\nnot complete then absence of motive shall also give a negative\n\neffect while convicting the accused persons.            The next\n\ncircumstance alleged against the appellants Satendra          and\n\nDinesh is that the deceased was seen with the appellants soon\n\nbefore the incident.   The learned counsel for the appellants\n\nhas submitted that the facts of last seen together should be\n\nproved so as not to leave any time gap between the point of\n\ntime when the accused and the deceased were seen last alive\n\nand when the deceased is found dead.      Such time gap should\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                 16</span>\n\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nbe so small that possibility of any person other than the\n\naccused being the author of the crime becomes impossible.\n\nReliance has been placed on the judgment passed by the Apex\n\nCourt in the case of &quot;Bodhraj alias <a href=\"/doc/408848/\" id=\"a_13\">Bodha and others Vs.\n\nState of Jammu &amp; Kashmir</a>) [(<a href=\"/doc/1210867/\" id=\"a_14\">2002) 8 SCC 45]                    and\n\n&quot;Sudhash Chand Vs. State of Rajasthan</a>&quot; [(2002) 1 SCC\n\n702] in which it is held that there should not be much time\n\ngap between the point of time when the accused and the\n\ndeceased were seen last alive and when the deceased was\n\nkilled.   In the present case according to Dr. Rawat (PW21) the\n\ndead body of the deceased was much putrefied and therefore,\n\naccording to Dr. Rawat he would have died within 2-7 days\n\nfrom the date and time of post mortem.       Post mortem      was\n\ndone on 12.7.2006 and therefore, the deceased would have\n\ndied in between 5.7.2006 to 10.7.2006.      It was apparent that\n\nthe deceased Praveen took the accused Sarika on his\n\nmotorcycle so that she could appear in her examination at\n\nExcellence School, Kevlari and therefore, the deceased was\n\nfound alive on 9.7.2006 upto 10.00 a.m.     Hence, it is possible\n\nthat his death was caused in between at about 10.00 a.m of\n\n9.7.2006 and 10.7.2006.     Hence, it is possible that the culprit\n\nwould have taken the deceased Praveen on 9.7.2006 and the\n\ndeceased would have been killed on the same day.        Hence, in\n\nthe present case, there is no such time gap between the fact of\n\nlast seen and the death of the deceased.</span></span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                    17</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">                                               Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                               Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                               Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">21.          However, it was for the prosecution to prove the\n\nfact of last seen by believable witnesses.          The prosecution has\n\nexamined one Sarpanch Vishnu Prasad Tekam (PW2), Ashok\n\n(PW10) and Prakashchand Jhangela (PW11) to prove the fact of\n\nlast seen.    If evidence of Vishnu Prasad Tekam is considered\n\nthen it would be apparent that he gave the statement about the\n\nentire story as told by Ramaiyalal Patel and his evidence is\n\nnothing, but a hearsay evidence which is not admissible. He\n\ndid not claim that on 9.7.2006 he was present in front of the\n\nExcellence     School   where     the    alleged      talk   between    the\n\ndeceased Praveen and the appellants took place.                   The case\n\ndiary statement Ex.D/1 of the witness Vishnu Prasad Tekam\n\nwas recorded on 9.9.2006 i.e. two months after the incident.\n\nWhen Vishnu Prasad Tekam did not claim that he saw the\n\ndeceased Praveen and the appellants in a hotel then his\n\nhearsay      evidence   does    not     give    any     support    to   the\n\nprosecution&#x27;s story.    Witness Ashok (PW10) has stated that, in\n\nmonth of July at about 9.30 a.m the deceased Praveen went to\n\nhis shop to take Gutka and a dispute took place for payment of\n\na lesser price.   Thereafter, on the second day Ashok identified\n\nthe person who visited         his shop by viewing his photograph\n\nshown by the Police.      However, in statement of Ashok he did\n\nnot mention that the deceased Praveen was accompanied by\n\neither of the appellants.      Hence the evidence given by Ashok\n\ndoes not connect the appellants with the deceased Praveen.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                18</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">                                          Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                          Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                          Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nEvidence given by Ashok cannot be considered as an evidence\n\nof last seen between the deceased Praveen and the accused\n\npersons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">22.        So far as the statement of Prakashchand Jhangela\n\n(PW11) is concerned, it suffers with several drawbacks.           He\n\nhas claimed that when he was going to his house from the\n\nPolice Station he saw the appellants Satendra           and Dinesh\n\nalong with the deceased Praveen. They were present in Ashok\n\nLodhi&#x27;s hotel and a talk took place between them that\n\nSatendra   told the deceased Praveen that Dinesh wanted to\n\npurchase   a   motorcycle   and     if   Praveen   helps    in   such\n\npurchasing then such purchasing would be done within two\n\nhours and they could come back within two hours. Thereafter,\n\nthe appellants Satendra      and Dinesh took the deceased\n\nPraveen on the motorcycle driven by Satendra towards Ugli.\n\nIf case diary statement Ex.D/3 of this witness is examined then\n\nhe did not claim in his case diary statements that he went\n\ninside the hotel of Ashok Lodhi. On the contrary in case diary\n\nstatement Ex.D/3 he has stated that two unknown persons\n\ncame on a motorcycle and took one person who was standing\n\nnear a motorcycle to hotel of one Jain and thereafter, they went\n\nto the Pan Shop of Ashok Lodhi and then they went on a Victor\n\nMotorcycle towards Ugli.       According to the case diary\n\nstatement of Prakashchand Jhangela (PW11) the alleged three\n\npersons went inside the hotel of one Jain and it is not claimed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                    19</span>\n\n                                               Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                               Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                               Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nby him that he went inside the hotel and heard their talk.             He\n\nhas alleged that those three persons went to the Pan Shop of\n\nAshok Lodhi and thereafter, they went on a motorcycle towards\n\nUgli. Hence Prakashchand Jhangela (PW11) did not claim in\n\nhis case diary statement Ex.D/3 that he heard about the talk\n\nwhich took place between those three persons and therefore,\n\nhis claim before the trial Court that the appellant Satendra\n\ntold the deceased Praveen to visit him for the purchase of\n\nmotorcycle is nothing but an after thought explanation given\n\nby Prakashchand Jhangela (PW11) to establish that the\n\nappellants had taken the deceased along with them.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">23.          The   second   draw        back    in   the   statement    of\n\nPrakashchand Jhangela (PW11) is           that neither the deceased\n\nPraveen nor the appellants Satendra and Dinesh were known\n\nto him. In case diary statement ExD/3 he gave the version\n\nrelating to one unknown person and other two unknown\n\npersons.   He has accepted in para 11 of his statement that the\n\ndeceased Praveen was not known to him but he has claimed in\n\npara 7 of his statement that the appellants Satendra                   and\n\nDinesh were known to him prior to the incident.                     If the\n\nappellant Satendra      and Dinesh had taken the deceased\n\nPraveen in    front of Prakashchand Jhangela (PW11) then he\n\nwould have mentioned the name of Satendra and Dinesh in his\n\ncase diary statement Ex.D/3 and therefore, according to the\n\nstatement of Prakashchand Jhangela (PW11) the deceased\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                20</span>\n\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nPraveen was taken by two unknown persons and not by the\n\nappellants who were known to him.      Thirdly, he has accepted\n\nthat while going to his house he has to pass over bus station\n\nand school road.      He has accepted that Gram Pachayat\n\nComplex would not be in his way while going to his house then\n\nhe could not see the motorcycle of the deceased lying in front\n\nof Panchayat Complex.     If he would have gone through the\n\nroad of Panchayat Complex he could not see the culprit and the\n\ndeceased Praveen who were standing on the school road.\n\nSurprisingly upon the story of witness Prakashchand Jhangela\n\n(PW11) regarding deceased Praveen being taken by the\n\nappellants Satendra   and Dinesh to Inspector S. K. Maravi\n\n(PW15) and Inspector S. K. Maravi did recover the motorcycle\n\nof the deceased Praveen which was lying in front of Excellence\n\nSchool on the same very day.   Prakashchand Jhangela (PW11)\n\nhas claimed that motorcycle was collected by Inspector S. K.\n\nMaravi on the same day and it was taken to the Police Station.\n\nHowever, if seizure memo Ex.P/21 is perused then motorcycle\n\nof the deceased Praveen was seized on 10.7.2006 and no time\n\nof seizure has been mentioned on the seizure memo Ex.P/21.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">24.             It is accepted by the witness      Prakashchand\n\nJhangela that the deceased Praveen was not known to him.\n\nThe deceased Praveen was not residing at Village Dungariya\n\nalong with the accused Sarika.      The accused Sarika was not\n\nresident of Village Kevlari and therefore, when Praveen visited\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                  21</span>\n\n                                         Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                         Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                         Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nalong with Sarika to Village Kevlari so that she could appear in\n\nthe examination then the witness Prakashchand Jhangela has\n\nno opportunity to confirm that the motorcycle which was lying\n\nin front of the school was of Madam Sarika or her husband.\n\nPrakashchand Jhangela did not claim that he was present in\n\nfront of the school when the deceased Praveen dropped his\n\nwife Sarika at the school and therefore, he had no reason to\n\npart with the information about motorcycle. Hence, statement\n\ngiven by      Prakashchand Jhangela that motorcycle of the\n\ndeceased Praveen and Sarika was lying in front of the school\n\nindicates that he was giving his version on the basis of the\n\nfacts informed to him by Inspector Maravi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">25.          It is pertinent to note that the witness who was a\n\nHome Guard Sainik working at Police Station, Kevlari was\n\navailable at Police Station on 9.7.2006 as well as after 12 th July,\n\n2006 but his case diary      statement Ex.D/3 was recorded on\n\n15.7.2006.     Prakashchand Jhangela has given an explanation\n\nthat he went to Seoni along with the S.D.O.P and he came back\n\non 12.7.2006 and therefore, he was not available for his\n\nevidence to be recorded.     According to him he told about the\n\nfact of last seen to the Inspector S. K. Maravi on 9.7.2006 and\n\nhe has admitted in the cross examination that Inspector S. K.\n\nMaravi called the appellants for interrogation on 9.7.2006\n\nitself. The statement given by Prakashchand Jhangela appears\n\nto be a falsehood because such a fact has not been told by him\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                    22</span>\n\n                                            Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                            Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                            Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nin his case diary statement Ex.D/3.        If Inspector S.K. Maravi\n\nwould have received an information on 9.7.2006 that the\n\ndeceased Praveen went with appellant Satendra and Dinesh\n\nand he would have called the appellants on the evening of\n\n9.7.2006 then the crime would have been traced at the most on\n\n10.7.2006 but if the conduct of Inspector S. K.             Maravi is\n\naccepted then on 10.7.2006 he received a missing report\n\nEx.P/1 lodged by the accused Sarika. Again on 11.7.2006 he\n\nreceived a missing report Ex.P/7 given by Ramaiyalal (PW3),\n\nfather of the deceased.       If        Inspector S. K. Maravi had\n\nknowledge on 9.7.2006 that the deceased Praveen went with\n\nthe appellant Satendra and Dinesh then he would have\n\ninformed such a fact to the father of the deceased Ramaiyalal\n\nand Ramaiyalal would not have shown his doubt upon Sannilal,\n\nthe President of Guardian and Teachers Association of the\n\nSchool Durgariya.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">26.        Under    these   circumstances,        the   testimony    of\n\nPrakashchand Jhangela appears to be false.              If he saw the\n\nappellants taking the deceased Praveen with them on 9.7.2006\n\nthen he would have told about such a fact to the Inspector\n\nMaravi on the same day.     If he pointed out that motorcycle of\n\nthe deceased Praveen was lying in front of the school, then it\n\nwould have been taken to the Police Station on the same very\n\nday however, looking to the seizure memo Ex.P/21 motorcycle\n\nwas seized after filing of missing report Ex.P/1.        If Inspector\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                  23</span>\n\n                                          Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                          Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                          Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nS.K.   Maravi was making an enquiry about missing of the\n\ndeceased Praveen then statement of Prakashchand Jhangela\n\ncould be recorded in that missing enquiry at least on 10.7.2006\n\nwhen he was available at the Police Station.        If he went with\n\nthe S.D.O.P to the District Head Quarter, Seoni then he was\n\navailable on 12.7.2006 and thereafter, thus no reason has been\n\nshown by the Inspector S. K. Maravi as to why the statement of\n\nthe witness Prakashchand Jhangela was not recorded before\n\n15.7.2006.     Also if the witness Prakashchand Jhangela would\n\nhave given a substantial information then it would have been\n\nwritten in his case diary statement Ex.D/3 specifically and also\n\nInspector S.K. Maravi would have acted upon his information\n\non 9.7.2006 itself.    On the contrary Inspector S.K. Maravi took\n\nsteps to enquire about the missing report on and after\n\n12.7.2006.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">27.           On the basis of the aforesaid discussion it is clear\n\nthat the statement given by Prakashchand Jhangela              is not\n\nbelievable.     He is a prepared witness prepared by Inspector\n\nS.K.   Maravi.       Hence, the prosecution has failed to prove\n\nbeyond doubt that the appellants Satendra and Dinesh\n\nabducted the deceased Praveen or they were seen with the\n\ndeceased Praveen soon before the incident of his murder.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">28.           Next    circumstance    which   is   alleged   by   the\n\nprosecution is recovery of weapons and clothes of the\n\nappellants worn by them at the time of incident.              In this\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                  24</span>\n\n                                         Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                         Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                         Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nconnection the Inspector S. K. Maravi (PW19) has recorded a\n\nmemo under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act of the appellants\n\nSatendra and Dinesh as Exs.P/11 and P/13 respectively.          It is\n\nclaimed that the dead body of the deceased was recovered on\n\nthe basis of memo given by these two appellants.         In support\n\nof Inspector S. K. Maravi three witnesses Umesh Kumar\n\nShrivas (PW7), Shiv Bharti (PW9) and        Press Correspondent\n\nRajendra @ Raju (PW18) were taken as witness on aforesaid\n\nmemo.     Out of them Rajendra @ Raju has turned hostile\n\nwhereas, no question was asked to witness Shiv Bharti (PW9)\n\nbefore the trial Court relating       to memo Exs.P/13 to P/15.\n\nUmesh Kumar Shrivas (PW7) has stated about the confessions\n\ndone by the appellants Satendra and Dinesh.           However, by\n\nbare perusal of memo Ex.P/11 and P/13, it would be apparent\n\nthat the appellants Satendra and Dinesh gave the description\n\nabout receiving of Rs.5000/- from the accused Sarika and\n\ngiving of Rs.500/- to the accused Dinesh and they informed\n\nabout the fact where they kept their clothes and weapons of\n\nthe offence but, in the text of entire memo given by the\n\nappellants Satendra and Dinesh, it was not mentioned that\n\nthey will show the place where they killed the deceased or\n\ndead body was lying.   Hence, the dead body of the deceased\n\ncannot be said to be recovered on the information given by\n\nappellants Satendra or Dinesh.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                25</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">                                       Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_39\">29.        If the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act is\n\nexamined then it is a proviso to <a href=\"/doc/967059/\" id=\"a_17\">Sections 24</a> and <a href=\"/doc/387768/\" id=\"a_18\">26</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act.   It is provided in <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act\n\nthat if in consequence of any information given by the accused\n\nin custody if any new fact is discovered then such information\n\nwhether it amounts to a confession or not, is admissible and it\n\nmay be proved.     Hence, for application of <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 27</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act, it is necessary for the accused to give an\n\ninformation relating to a new fact.      By perusal of memo\n\nExs.P/11 and P/13 under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act given\n\nby the appellants Satendra and Dinesh respectively, it would be\n\napparent that they did not give any information about the dead\n\nbody of the deceased Praveen and therefore, it cannot be said\n\nthat the dead body was recovered on information given by the\n\nappellants Satendra and Dinesh.        Inspector S. K. Maravi\n\n(PW19) has stated that he started his proceedings of enquiry\n\nand investigation on 12.7.2006 at about 7.20 a.m when he\n\nrecorded the memo Ex.P/11 of the appellant Satendra.\n\nInspector S. K. Maravi could not explain as to how he got the\n\ninformation that the deceased Praveen was killed and the\n\nappellants Satendra and Dinesh were the culprits.             The\n\nconduct of Inspector Maravi as proved by himself indicates\n\nthat he did not take any step when the information of last seen\n\nwas given by the witness Prakashchand Jhangela (PW11) in\n\nthe period between 9.7.2006 and 11.7.2006.        He started his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                 26</span>\n\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nproceedings by recording the memo under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 27</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act given by the appellant Satendra. No explanation\n\nwas given by Inspector S. K. Maravi as to why he started the\n\ninterrogation of the appellants so confidently so that he had\n\ncalled Ramaiyalal and all his co-villagers present at Kevlari on\n\nthe day when interrogation was initiated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">30.    In this context if evidence of Ramaiyalal Patel is\n\nperused then in para 13 of his statement he has stated that he\n\nwent to take a dip in the river at about 6.00 a.m in the morning\n\nand one Constable came to that place with the information that\n\nhis son has been killed and the Inspector was calling him\n\nimmediately and thereafter, he along with other co-villagers\n\nwent to the Police station.   The witness Umesh Kumar Shrivas\n\n(PW7) who was also a witness of memo Exs.P/11 and P/13 has\n\naccepted that when he was bathing in a river along with\n\nRamaiyalal such intimation was received and they were called\n\nto the Police Station.   Memo under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence\n\nAct given by the appellants were recorded after arrival of\n\nUmesh Kumar Shrivas (PW7).       According to the prosecution a\n\nmemo Ex.P/11 under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act was given\n\nby the appellant Satendra on 12.7.2006 at about 7.20 a.m but\n\nthe information which was sent by Inspector S.K. Maravi to\n\nRamaiyalal and Umesh Kumar Shrivas prior to recording of\n\nthat memo, that the dead body of the deceased Praveen was\n\ntraced and those witnesses were immediately called to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                27</span>\n\n                                      Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                      Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                      Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nPolice Station.      When a missing report was lodged by\n\nRamaiyalal and Inspector S. K. Maravi was making an enquiry\n\nin persuance of that missing report then he could know about\n\nthe dead body of the deceased when an information was given\n\nby the accused persons, but, the message which was sent by\n\nInspector     S.K. Maravi to Ramaiyalal and Umesh Kumar\n\nShrivas, clearly indicates that Inspector S.K. Maravi got a\n\nconfirmed news that Praveen was killed and his body was lying\n\nat a particular place.   Without getting any confirmatory news\n\nabout the dead body of the deceased Praveen such message\n\ncould not be sent by Inspector S.K. Maravi to the witnesses\n\nthat the deceased Praveen was killed.     The witness Umesh\n\nKumar Shrivas (PW7) has accepted in para 19 of his statement\n\nthat he was taken to the spot in a Police vehicle where the\n\ndead body was lying and the vehicle was stopped on the forest\n\nroad where the dead body was lying only 2-3 ft. away.       Such\n\nevidence given by Umesh Kumar Shrivas indicates that before\n\ntaking the accused persons to the spot the Police already knew\n\nwhere the dead body was lying and therefore, Inspector S. K.\n\nMaravi did not indicate in memo Exs.P/11 and P.13 that the\n\nappellants Satendra and Dinesh would show the location of the\n\ndead body.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">31.          When a fact which is already in knowledge of the\n\nPolice is repeated by the accused then it cannot be said that\n\nsuch statement given by the accused is again admissible under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                    28</span>\n\n                                            Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                            Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                            Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"97995306\" id=\"span_32\">In this context the judgment\n\npassed by the Apex Court in the case of &quot;<a href=\"/doc/97995306/\" id=\"a_26\">Vijendra Vs.

Hence, when Inspector\n\nS. K.

Maravi (PW15) has stated about a\n\nmemo Exs.P/11 and P/13 given under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 27</a> of the\n\nEvidence   Act   by   the   appellants    Satendra     and    Dinesh\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                30</span>\n\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nrespectively and also about consequential seizure Exs. P/14\n\nand P/15.    However, the witness Rajendra alias Raju (PW18) a\n\nPress Correspondent has turned hostile whereas, no question\n\nabout the aforesaid documents was asked by the prosecution\n\nwhen the witness Shiv Bharti was examined before the trial\n\ncourt.      The witness Umesh Kumar Shrivas (PW7) has\n\nconfirmed about the documents Exs.P/11, P/13 to P/15, but\n\nwhen he was asked as to whether the house of Dinesh was\n\nsingle storied or double storied, he could not answer the\n\nquestion.    He has stated that     he reached to the house of\n\nDinesh at about 4.00-5.00 p.m and therefore, due to darkness\n\nhe could not see the position of the house of the appellant\n\nDinesh.     The seizure took place in the month of July and at\n\nabout 4.00 to 5.00 p.m, before sunset and he could not deny\n\nabout having seen the house, its colour or single or double\n\nstorey if any. Again when he was asked about the place where\n\nthe dagger was recovered from Dinesh then he replied that he\n\nwas standing in the courtyard and the appellant Dinesh and\n\nSatendra went inside the house and brought the dagger and\n\nclothes.    His version is contradictory to the seizure memo\n\nEx.P/14.      Similarly, he could not give the appropriate\n\ndescription relating to the seizure from the appellant Satendra.\n\nHe stated in an omnibus manner that Satendra gave a sum of\n\nRs.4500/- from the cash box of his shop, but he did not state\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                               31</span>\n\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                       Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nspecifically that for recovery of the clothes of Satendra he\n\nwent to the house of the appellant Satendra.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">34.         After considering the evidence of the witness\n\nUmesh Kumar Shrivas, who was the neighbor of the deceased\n\nPraveen at Village Mand, it appears that        Inspector S. K.\n\nMaravi completed the procedure of recovery at Police Station\n\nKevlari and therefore, Umesh Kumar Shrivas could not know\n\nabout the house of the appellants Satendra and Dinesh.\n\nHence, the witnesses Umesh Kumar Shrivas, Shiv Bharti and\n\nRajendra alias Raju created a doubt in the statement of\n\nInspector S. K. Maravi that clothes and weapons were seized\n\nfrom the appellants Satendra or Dinesh.      In this context the\n\nreport of Forensic Science Laboratory Ex.P/38 is important.\n\nNo blood was found on the clothes as well as weapons\n\nrecovered from the appellants Satendra and Dinesh and\n\ntherefore, recovery of clothes and weapons recovered from the\n\nappellants Satendra and Dinesh loses its evidentiary value.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"164107115\" id=\"span_38\">35.         On the basis of the aforesaid discussion, it is\n\napparent    that prosecution could not prove its case beyond\n\ndoubt.     Chain of circumstantial evidence is broken.        The\n\nprosecution could not prove that the accused Sarika had any\n\nreason to get her husband killed.   No motive of the appellants\n\nSatendra and Dinesh could be proved to kill the deceased\n\nPraveen, fact of last seen together between the appellants\n\nSatendra, Dinesh and the deceased Praveen could not be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                32</span>\n\n                                      Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                      Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                      Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\nproved.   No enmity between them is proved.    The prosecution\n\ncould not prove that the dead body of the deceased was\n\nrecovered from information given by the appellants Satendra\n\nand Dinesh.    If recovery of clothes and weapons from the\n\nappellants Satendra and Dinesh is accepted as it is then no\n\nblood stain was found either on clothes of the appellants or\n\nweapons recovered from them.            Hence the appellants\n\nSatendra and Dinesh cannot be convicted of offence under\n\nSection 364 or 302 of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_32\">I.P.C</a>.   In this connection the judgment\n\npassed by the Apex Court in the case of         <a href=\"/doc/164107115/\" id=\"a_33\">Bakshish Singh</a>\n\n(supra)   may be referred in which it is held that in a case\n\nresting on circumstantial evidence chain of evidence must be\n\nsuch as not to leave any reasonable ground for conclusion\n\nconsistent with the innocence of the accused and it must be\n\nsuch as to show that within all human probability the act must\n\nhave been done by the accused.      Hence, in the present case\n\nthe trial Court has committed an error in convicting the\n\nappellants Satendra and Dinesh of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 302</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_35\">364</a> of I.P.C. When the appellants were not connected with the\n\ncrime then it cannot be said that they destroyed the evidence\n\nto save themselves or someone else.</span>      Hence, the appellants\n\ncannot be convicted of offence under Section 201 of I.P.C.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">36.        In the light of aforesaid discussion the prosecution\n\ncould not connect the accused persons of offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 120-B</a> of I.P.C and therefore, acquittal of the accused\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                        33</span>\n\n                                               Criminal Appeal No.1875/2007\n                                               Criminal Appeal No.1937/2007\n                                               Criminal Appeal No.1397/2008\n\n\n       persons recorded by the trial Court of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_37\">Section\n\n       120-B</a> of I.P.C. cannot be interfered.    Hence, the appeal filed\n\n       by the State against all the accused persons against their\n\n       acquittal of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_38\">section 120-B</a> of I.P.C is hereby\n\n       dismissed.      When the prosecution could not connect the\n\n       appellants Satendra and Dinesh with the crime, it is a case in\n\n       which their appeals may be accepted.           Consequently, the\n\n       appeals filed by the appellants Satendra @ Pappu and Dinesh\n\n       alias Deenu are hereby allowed.      Their conviction as well as\n\n       the sentence of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_40\">364</a> and <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_41\">201</a> of\n\n       I.P.C are hereby set aside.       They are acquitted from the\n\n       aforesaid charges.    The appellants Satendra and Dinesh would\n\n       be entitled to get the fine amount back if they have deposited\n\n       before the trial Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">       37.               The respondent Sarika was on bail.           Her\n\n       presence is no more required before this Court and therefore,\n\n       it is directed that her bail bonds shall stand discharged.     The\n\n       appellants Satendra @ Pappu and Dinesh @ Deenu are in\n\n       custody.     They be released without any delay. The Registry is\n\n       directed to arrange for issuance of their release warrants.\n\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">       (SHANTANU KEMKAR)                               (N.K.
