Seeing no\n\n                  alternative, Sarla had filed a divorce petition which was withdrawn\n\n                  on the assurance of the accused persons that they would keep\n\n                  her properly and thereafter, a daughter, namely, Ansul, was born.\n\n                  Thereafter, the accused persons again started harassing Sarla\n\n                  and turned her out of their house in three clothes.

The allegations\n\n                  that Narender had maintained illicit relations with his sister-in-law\n\n                  and the said fact came to the notice of Sarla after about 06 to 07\n\n                  years of her marriage even thereafter she continued to live with\n\n                  Narender for several years, therefore, that could not be\n\n                  considered to be reason for committing suicide.            Even the\n\n                  allegation that Narender had extra martial relations with one\n\n                  Sonia as well could not be substantiated from any independent\n\n                  source. Even Sonia was not joined or interrogated by the police\n\n                  during investigation to verify the said fact. Assuming the said fact\n\n                  to be true for the sake of discussion then also, can it be said that\n\n                  a lady whose marriage was solemnized 11 years ago would\n\n                  commit suicide for the reason that her husband had maintained\n\n                  the extra marital/illicit relations with some other lady, particularly\n\n                  when the said fact had come to her notice several years prior to\n\n                  committing the suicide.
