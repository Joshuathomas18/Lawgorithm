Mr. Kapil Sibal, learned senior counsel appearing for the\n\nprivate parties/petitioners in the concerned matter(s) submitted that\n\nthe procedure followed by the ED in registering the Enforcement\n\nCase Information Report10 is opaque, arbitrary and violative of the\n\nconstitutional rights of an accused.         It was submitted that the\n\nprocedure being followed under the PMLA is draconian as it violates\n\nthe basic tenets of the criminal justice system and the rights\n\nenshrined in Part III of the Constitution of India, in particular\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_12\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/655638/\" id=\"a_13\">, 20</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">21</a> thereof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n\n10   For short, “ECIR”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">\f                                              24</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"151036912\" id=\"span_12\">(i)       A question was raised as to whether there can be a procedure\n\nin law, where penal proceedings can be started against an individual,\n\nwithout informing him of the charges? It was contended that as per\n\npresent situation, the ED can arrest an individual on the basis of an\n\nECIR without informing him of its contents, which is per se arbitrary\n\nand violative of the constitutional rights of an accused. The right of\n\nan accused to get a copy of the First Information Report10A at an early\n\nstage and also the right to know the allegations as an inherent part of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 21.</a> Reference was made to <a href=\"/doc/151036912/\" id=\"a_16\">Youth Bar Association of India\n\nvs. Union of India &amp; Anr.11</a> in support of this plea. Further, as per\n\nlaw, the agencies investigating crimes need to provide a list of all the\n\ndocuments and materials seized to the accused in order to be\n\nconsistent with the principles of transparency and openness12. It\n\nwas also submitted that under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_17\">Cr.P.C</a>., every FIR registered by\n\nan officer under <a href=\"/doc/996281/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 154</a> thereof is to be forwarded to the\n\njurisdictional Magistrate.             However, this procedure is not being\n\nfollowed in ECIR cases.</span>              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"178580003\" id=\"span_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"74066450\" id=\"span_14\">Further, violation of <a href=\"/doc/570256/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 157</a> of the\n\n10A   For short, “FIR”\n11(2016) 9 SCC 473 (Para 11.1); and Court on its <a href=\"/doc/74066450/\" id=\"a_20\">Own Motion vs. State</a>, 2010 SCC OnLine Del\n4309 (Paras 39 &amp; 54)\n12Criminal Trials Guidelines Regarding Inadequacies and Deficiencies, In re, vs. State of Andhra\nPradesh &amp; Ors., (2021) 10 SCC 598 (Para 11); also see: <a href=\"/doc/178580003/\" id=\"a_21\">Nitya Dharmananda &amp; Anr. vs. Gopal\nSheelum Reddy &amp; Anr.</a>, (2018) 2 SCC 93 (Para 8).</span></span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                  25</span><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"178580003\" id=\"span_16\"><a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_22\">Cr.P.C</a>. was also alleged and it was submitted that this has led to\n\nnon-compliance with the procedure prescribed under the law\n\n(<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_23\">Cr.P.C</a>.) and the law <a href=\"/doc/178580003/\" id=\"a_24\">laid down by</a> this Court in catena of decisions.\n\nIt was vehemently argued that in some cases the ECIR is voluntarily\n\nprovided, while in others it is not, which is completely arbitrary and\n\ndiscriminatory.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">(ii)   It was argued that as per definition of <a href=\"/doc/169382/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 3</a> of the PMLA,\n\nthe accused can either directly or indirectly commit money-\n\nlaundering if he is connected by way of any process or activity with\n\nthe proceeds of crime and has projected or claimed such proceeds\n\nas untainted property. In light of this, it was suggested that the\n\ninvestigation may shed some light on such alleged proceeds of crime,\n\nfor which, facts must first be collected and there should be a\n\ndefinitive determination whether such proceeds of crime have\n\nactually been generated from the scheduled offence. Thus, there\n\nmust be at least a prima facie quantification to ensure that the\n\nthreshold of the PMLA is met and it cannot be urged that the ECIR\n\nis an internal document. Therefore, in the absence of adherence to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                                26</span>\n\nthe requirements of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_26\">Cr.P.C</a>. and the procedure established by\n\nlaw, these are being violated blatantly13.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">(iii) An anomalous situation is created where based on such ECIR,\n\nthe ED can summon accused persons and seek details of financial\n\ntransactions. The accused is summoned under <a href=\"/doc/681964/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 50</a> of the\n\nPMLA to make such statements which are treated as admissible in\n\nevidence. Throughout the process, the accused might well be\n\nunaware of the allegations against him. It is clear that <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_28\">Cr.P.C</a>. has\n\nseparate provisions for summoning of the accused under <a href=\"/doc/178152793/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n\n41A</a> and for witnesses under <a href=\"/doc/722823/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 160</a>. The same distinction is\n\nabsent under the PMLA. Further, Chapter XII of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_31\">Cr.P.C</a>. is not\n\nbeing followed by the ED and, as such, there are no governing\n\nprinciples of investigation, no legal criteria and guiding principles\n\nwhich are required to be followed.                       As such, the initiation of\n\ninvestigation by the ED, which can potentially curtail the liberty of\n\nthe individual, would suffer from the vice of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 14</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India14.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"117859307\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"627937\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"10239019\" id=\"span_20\">13   <a href=\"/doc/10239019/\" id=\"a_33\">Lalita Kumari vs. Government of Uttar Pradesh and Ors.</a>, (2014) 2 SCC 1 (Para 120.1)\n14 E.P.

It has been vehemently argued that the offence of\n\nmoney-laundering requires the proceeds of crime to be mandatorily\n\n‘projected or claimed’ as ‘untainted property’. Meaning thereby that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/169382/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 3</a> is applicable only to the generation of proceeds of crime,\n\nsuch proceeds being projected or claimed as untainted property. It\n\nis stated that the pertinent condition of ‘and’ projecting or claiming\n\ncannot be ousted and made or interpreted to be ‘or’ by the\n\nExplanation that has been brought about by way of the amendment\n\nmade vide <a href=\"/doc/105739094/\" id=\"a_38\">Finance (No.2) Act, 2019</a>. It has been submitted that such\n\nan act would also be unconstitutional, as being enlarging the ambit\n\nof a principal section by way of adding an Explanation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">(v)   It is also stated that the general practice is that the ED registers\n\nan ECIR immediately upon an FIR of a predicate offence being\n\nregistered.   The cause of action being entirely different from the\n\npredicate offence, as such, can lead to a situation where there is no\n\ndifference between the predicate offence and money-laundering. In\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">\f                                            28</span>\n\nsupport of the said argument, reliance was placed on the <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 3</a> of\n\nthe Vienna Convention15, where words like “conversion or transfer of\n\nproperty”, “for the purpose of concealing or disguising the illicit\n\norigin of the property or of assisting any person who is involved in\n\nthe commission of such an offence or offences to evade the legal\n\nconsequences of his actions”, have been used. It is urged that what\n\nwas sought to be criminalised was not the mere acquisition and use\n\nof proceeds of crime, but it was the conversion or transfer for the\n\npurpose of either concealing or disguising the illicit origin of the\n\nproperty to evade the legal consequences of one’s actions. Reference\n\nwas also made to the Preamble of the PMLA which refers to India’s\n\nglobal commitments to combat the menace of money-laundering.\n\nLearned counsel has then referred to the definition of “money-\n\nlaundering” as per the Prevention of Money-Laundering Bill, 199916\n\nto show how upon reference to the Select Committee of the Rajya\n\nSabha, certain observations were made and, hence, the amendment\n\nwas effected, wherein the words “and projecting it as untainted\n\n\n\n15United Nations adopted and signed the Convention against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs\nand Psychotropic Substances (hereinafter referred to as “Vienna Convention” or “the 1988\nConvention” or “the UN Drugs Convention”, as the case may be)\n16   For short, “1999 Bill”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">\f                                             29</span>\n\nproperty” were added to the definition which was finally passed in\n\nthe       form     of    PMLA.          We   have   reproduced   the   relevant\n\nsections/provisions hereinbelow at the appropriate place.

The\n\nsame has now supposedly been whittled down by various\n\namendments over the years. It has been submitted that by way of\n\namendments in 2009, proviso have been added to <a href=\"/doc/1070542/\" id=\"a_41\">Sections 5</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/354004/\" id=\"a_42\">17</a>, which have diluted certain safeguards. Further, it is submitted\n\nthat the safeguard under <a href=\"/doc/1665185/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 17(1)</a> has been totally done away\n\nwith in the amendment made in 2019. To further this argument, it\n\nhas been suggested that the filing of chargesheet in respect of a\n\npredicate offence was impliedly there in <a href=\"/doc/44912/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 19</a> of the PMLA,\n\nsince there is a requirement which cannot be fulfilled sans an\n\ninvestigation, to record reasons to believe that ‘any person has been\n\nguilty of an offence punishable under this Act’. In respect of <a href=\"/doc/681964/\" id=\"a_45\">Section\n\n50</a>, it is urged that though there is no threshold mentioned in the\n\n\n\n\n17   Supra at Footnote No.3 (Para 11)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">\f                                  30</span>\n\nAct, yet the persons concerned should be summoned only after the\n\nregistration of the ECIR. It is, thus, submitted that any attempt to\n\nprosecute under the PMLA without prima facie recordings would be\n\ninconsistent with the Act itself and violative of the fundamental\n\nrights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">(vii) It is urged that the derivate Act cannot be more onerous than\n\nthe original.   It is suggested that the proceeds of crime and the\n\npredicate   offence   are   entwined   inextricably.   Further,   the\n\npunishment for generation of the proceeds of crime cannot be\n\ndisproportionate to the punishment for the underlying predicate\n\noffence.    The same analogy ought to apply to the procedural\n\nprotections, such as those provided under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 41A</a> of the\n\nCr.P.C., which otherwise would be foul of the constitutional\n\nprotections under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 21.</a>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">(viii) Learned counsel has also challenged the aspect of the\n\nSchedule being overbroad and inconsistent with the PMLA and the\n\npredicate offences.   It is argued that even in the Statements of\n\nObjects and Reasons of the 1999 Bill, it has been stated that the Act\n\nwas brought in to curb the laundering stemming from trade in\n\nnarcotics and drug related crimes. Reference is also made to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">\f                                             31</span>\n\nvarious conventions that are part of the jurisprudence behind the\n\nPMLA18. It was to be seen in light of organised crime, unlike its\n\napplication today to less heinous crimes such as theft.                               It is\n\nsubmitted that there was no intention or purpose to cover offences\n\nunder the PMLA so widely. It is also submitted that there are certain\n\noffences which are less severe and heinous than money-laundering\n\nitself and that the inclusion of such offences in the Schedule does\n\nnot have a rational nexus with the objects and reasons of the PMLA\n\nand the same is unreasonable, arbitrary and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_48\">Articles 14</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_49\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"355353\" id=\"span_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"399708\" id=\"span_27\">(ix) It has been submitted that the PMLA cannot be a standalone\n\nstatute. To bolster this claim, reliance has been placed on speeches\n\nmade by Ministers in the Parliament. Further reliance has been\n\nplaced on <a href=\"/doc/399708/\" id=\"a_50\">K.P. Varghese vs. Income Tax Officer</a>, <a href=\"/doc/355353/\" id=\"a_51\">Ernakulum &amp;\n\nAnr.19, Union of India &amp; Anr. vs. Martin Lottery Agencies</a>\n\n\n\n\n18 United Nations Convention Against Illicit Traffic in Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\nSubstances, 1988 (for short, “Vienna Convention”); Basle Statement of Principles, 1989; Forty\nRecommendations of the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering, 1990; Political\nDeclaration and Global Program of Action adopted by the United Nations General Assembly on\n23.02.1990; and Resolution passed at the UN Special Session on countering World Drug\nProblem Together – 8th to 10th June 1998.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">19   (1981) 4 SCC 173 (Para 8)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">\f                                         32</span>\n\nLimited20           and      P.    Chidambaram        vs.    Directorate    of\n\nEnforcement21.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">(x)      Our attention is also drawn to the provisions which have now\n\nbeen replaced in the statute. Prior to 2013 amendment, <a href=\"/doc/1045067/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 8(5)</a>\n\nof the PMLA was to the following effect: -\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">            “8. Adjudication—\n            ….\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">            (5) Whereon conclusion of a trial for any scheduled\n            offence, the person concerned is acquitted, the attachment\n            of the property or retention of the seized property or record\n            under sub-section (3) and net income, if any, shall cease to\n            have effect.”\n\nHowever, vide amendment in 2013, the words ‘trial for any\n\nscheduled offence’ were replaced with the words ‘trial of an offence\n\nunder this Act’.           It is urged that for the property to qualify as\n\nproceeds of crime, it must be connected in some way with the activity\n\nrelated to the scheduled offence. Meaning thereby that if there is no\n\nscheduled offence, there can be no property derived directly or\n\nindirectly; thus, an irrefutable conclusion that a scheduled offence\n\nis a pre-requisite for generation of proceeds of crime.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">20   (2009) 12 SCC 209 (Para 38)\n21   (2019) 9 SCC 24 (Para 25)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">\f                                             33</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">(xi) It is further argued that an Explanation has been added to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1161475/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 44(1)(d)</a> of the PMLA by way of Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019,\n\nwhich posits that a trial under the PMLA can proceed independent\n\nof the trial of scheduled offence. It is submitted that the Explanation\n\nis being given a mischievous interpretation when it ought to be read\n\nplainly and simply. It is stated that the Explanation relates only to\n\nthe Special Court and not the trial of the scheduled offence. It is\n\nsubmitted that a Special Court can never convict a person under the\n\nPMLA without returning a finding that a scheduled offence has been\n\ncommitted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">(xii) It is submitted that the application of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_54\">Cr.P.C</a>. is necessary since\n\nit is a procedure established by law and there cannot be an\n\ninvestigation outside the purview of <a href=\"/doc/996281/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 154</a> or 155 of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_56\">Cr.P.C</a>.\n\nReference is made to the constitutional safeguards of reasonability\n\nand fairness. It is submitted that the Act itself, under <a href=\"/doc/1772539/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 65</a>,\n\nprovides for the applicability of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_58\">Cr.P.C</a>.22 It is pointed out that\n\nseveral safeguards, procedural in nature are being violated.                             To\n\nillustrate a few - non registration of FIR, lack of a case diary,\n\n\n\n22Ashok Munilal Jain &amp; Anr. vs. Assistant Director, Directorate of Enforcement, (2018) 16 SCC\n158 (Paras 3-5)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">\f                                                 34</span>\n\nrestricted access to the ECIR, violation of <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 161</a> of the Cr.P.C.,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 41A</a> of the Cr.P.C., lack of magisterial permission under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/949418/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 155</a> of the Cr.P.C. Such unguided use of power to investigate\n\nand prosecute any person violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_62\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_63\">21</a> of the\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">(xiii) Another argument raised by the learned counsel is that the ED\n\nofficers are police officers. It is submitted that the determination of\n\nthe same depends on: (1) what is the object and purpose of the\n\nspecial statute and (2) the nature of power exercised by such\n\nofficers? The first argument in this regard is that if it can be shown\n\nthat in order to achieve the objectives of the special statute -\n\npreventive and detection steps to curb crime are permitted and\n\ncoercive powers are vested, then such an officer is a police officer.\n\nFurther, such an officer is covered within the ambit of Sections 25\n\nand 26 of the Indian Evidence Act, 187223. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"143202244\" id=\"span_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1090657\" id=\"span_32\">In support of the test to\n\ngauge the objective of the statute, reference has been made to <a href=\"/doc/1090657/\" id=\"a_64\">State\n\nof Punjab vs. Barkat Ram24</a>, wherein it was held —a customs\n\n\n\n\n23   For short, “the 1872 Act” or “the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_65\">Evidence Act</a>”\n24   (1962) 3 SCR 338; Also see: <a href=\"/doc/143202244/\" id=\"a_66\">Tofan Singh vs. State of Tamil Nadu</a>, 2020 SCC OnLine SC 882\n     (Para 88)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">\f                                                 35</span>\n\nofficer is not a police officer within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/412480/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 25</a> of the\n\n1872 Act. It is also stated that police officers had to be construed\n\nnot in a narrow way but in a wide and popular sense. Reference is\n\nmade to Sections 17 and 18 of the Police Act, 186125, whereunder\n\nan appointment of special police officers can be made. Thus, it is\n\nstated that it is not necessary to be enrolled under the 1861 Act, but\n\nif one is invested with the same powers i.e., the powers for prevention\n\nand detection of crime, one will be a police officer. Then, the PMLA\n\nis distinguished from the 1962 Act, Sea Customs Act, 187826,\n\nCentral Excise Act, 194427 and the <a href=\"/doc/95399496/\" id=\"a_68\">CGST Act</a>.                          The dissenting\n\nopinion of Subba Rao, J. in Barkat Ram28 is also relied upon.\n\nThereafter, it is stated that PMLA, being a purely penal statute, one\n\nneeds to look at the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the 1999\n\nBill and the Financial Action Task Force29 recommendations.</span></span>\n\n\n\n\n25   For short, “1861 Act”\n26   For short, “1878 Act” or “the Sea Customs Act”\n27   For short, “1944 Act” or “the <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_69\">Central Excise Act</a>”\n28   Supra at Footnote No.24\n29 For short, “FATF” – an inter-governmental body, which is the global money laundering and\nterrorist financing watchdog.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">\f                                               36</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1409644\" id=\"span_35\">(xiv) Reliance was also placed on <a href=\"/doc/1409644/\" id=\"a_70\">Raja Ram Jaiswal vs. State of\n\nBihar30</a>.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"143202244\" id=\"span_36\">Further, it has been stated that even in <a href=\"/doc/143202244/\" id=\"a_71\">Tofan Singh vs.\n\nState of Tamil Nadu31</a>, the case of Raja Ram Jaiswal32 has been\n\nrelied upon and it is concluded that when a person is vested with\n\nthe powers of investigation, he is said to be a police officer, as he\n\nprevents and detects crime. Further, the powers under <a href=\"/doc/133259215/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 50</a>\n\nof the PMLA for the purpose of investigation are in consonance with\n\nwhat has been held in Tofan Singh33 and establishes a direct\n\nrelationship with the prohibition under <a href=\"/doc/107536004/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 25</a> of the 1872 Act.\n\nAnother crucial point raised is that most statutes where officers have\n\nnot passed the muster of ‘police officers’ in the eyes of law, contain\n\nthe term “enquiry” in contrast with the term “investigation” used in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/133259215/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 50</a> of the PMLA. A parallel has also been drawn between the\n\ndefinition of “investigation” under the PMLA in <a href=\"/doc/3177162/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 2(1)(na)</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1067480/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 2(h)</a> of the Cr.P.C. Further, it is urged that the test of power\n\nto file ‘chargesheet’ is not determinative of being a police officer.</span>\n\n\n\n\n30   AIR 1964 SC 828\n31   2020 SCC OnLine SC 882 (Para 88) (also at Footnote No.24)\n32   Supra at Footnote No.30\n33   Supra at Footnote No.31 (also at Footnote No.24)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">\f                                        37</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">(xv)       It is then urged that <a href=\"/doc/142061811/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 44(1)(b)</a> of the PMLA stipulates\n\nthat cognizance can be taken only on a complaint being made by the\n\nAuthority under the PMLA. Whereas, in originally enacted <a href=\"/doc/142061811/\" id=\"a_78\">Section\n\n44(1)(b)</a>, both the conditions i.e., ‘filing of a police report’, as well as,\n\n‘a complaint made by an authority’ were covered. Learned counsel\n\nalso reminisces of the speech of the then Finance Minister on the\n\nPrevention of Money-Laundering (Amendment) Bill, 200534 in the\n\nLok Sabha on 06.05.2005. However, it was also conceded that the\n\namendment of <a href=\"/doc/142061811/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 44(1)(b)</a> of the PMLA removed the words,\n\n“upon perusal of police report of the facts which constitute an\n\noffence under this Act or”. Next amendment made was insertion of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/8344521/\" id=\"a_80\">Section 45(1A)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/122545441/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 73(2)(ua)</a>, by which the right of police\n\nofficers to investigate the offence under <a href=\"/doc/32161561/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 3</a> was restricted\n\nunless authorised by the Central Government by way of a general or\n\nspecial authorisation. Further amendment was deletion of <a href=\"/doc/8344521/\" id=\"a_83\">Section\n\n45(1)(a)</a> of the PMLA, making the offence of money-laundering under\n\nthe PMLA a non-cognizable offence. Further, it is submitted that\n\namendment to <a href=\"/doc/142061811/\" id=\"a_84\">Section 44(1)(b)</a> has been made as a consequence for\n\n\n\n\n34   For short, “2005 Amendment Bill”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">\f                                  38</span>\n\nmaking the offence under the PMLA non-cognizable. It is stated that\n\neven today if investigation is done by a police officer or another, he\n\ncan only file a complaint and not a police report. Therefore, the\n\nabove-mentioned test is irrelevant and inapplicable. Absurdity that\n\narises is due to two investigations being conducted, one by a police\n\nofficer and the other by the authorities specified under <a href=\"/doc/91492845/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 48</a>.\n\nAn additional point has been raised that the difference between a\n\ncomplaint under the PMLA and a chargesheet under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_86\">Cr.P.C</a>. is\n\nonly a nomenclature norm and they are essentially the same thing.\n\nThus, basing the determination of whether one is a police officer or\n\nnot, on the nomenclature, is not proper.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">(xvi)   In respect of interpretation and constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/133259215/\" id=\"a_87\">Section\n\n50</a> of the PMLA, our attention is drawn to <a href=\"/doc/88694036/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 50(2)</a> which\n\npertains to recording of statement of a person summoned during the\n\ncourse of an investigation. In that, <a href=\"/doc/5035080/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 50(3)</a> posits that such\n\nperson needs to state the truth.

The protection under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/107536004/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 25</a> of the 1872 Act is also pressed into service.\n\n(xix) To make good the point, learned counsel proceeded to delineate\n\nthe legislative history of <a href=\"/doc/107536004/\" id=\"a_108\">Section 25</a> of the 1872 Act. He referred to\n\nthe first report of the Law Commission of India and the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_109\">Cr.P.C</a>.,\n\nwhich was based on gross abuse of power by police officers for\n\nextracting confessions.39 Further, this protection was transplanted\n\ninto the 1872 Act40, where on the presumption that a confession\n\nmade to a police officer was obtained through force or coercion was\n\nfortified41. It was pointed out that recommendations of three Law\n\nCommissions – 14th, 48th and 69th which advocated for allowance of\n\n\n\n\n38   AIR 1959 SC 1012 (also at Footnote No.36)\n39   185th <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_110\">Law Commission Report on the Indian Evidence Act, 1872</a> (2003)\n40   See also: <a href=\"/doc/1090657/\" id=\"a_111\">Barkat Ram</a> (supra <a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_112\">at Footnote No.24)\n41   Balkishan A.

Thus, relying on Raja Ram\n\nJaiswal42 where a substantial link between <a href=\"/doc/107536004/\" id=\"a_113\">Section 25</a> of the 1872\n\nAct, police officer and confession has been settled. Therefore, the\n\npresent situation where prosecution can be mounted under <a href=\"/doc/198479305/\" id=\"a_114\">Section\n\n63</a> for failing to give such confessions is said to be contrary to\n\nprocedure established by law interlinked with the right to a fair trial\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_115\">Article 21.</a></span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"338008\" id=\"span_48\">Reliance has also been placed on <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_116\">Selvi &amp; Ors. vs.\n\nState of Karnataka43</a>, the 180th Law Commission Report and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 313</a> of the Cr.P.C. as being subsidiaries of right against self-\n\nincrimination and right to silence, not being read against him.\n\n(xx) Learned counsel then delineated on the preconditions for\n\nprotection of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 20(3).</a></span>          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1626264\" id=\"span_49\">First, the person standing in the\n\ncharacter of an accused, as <a href=\"/doc/338008/\" id=\"a_119\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/1626264/\" id=\"a_120\">State of Bombay vs. Kathi\n\nKalu Oghad44</a>, has been referred to.

It is urged\n\nthat both the position of law stands clarified in Nandini Satpathy45\n\nand Selvi46 — even to the extent where answering certain questions\n\ncan incriminate a person in other offences or where links are\n\nfurnished in chain of evidence required for prosecution. It is then\n\nurged that the expression ‘shall be compelled’ is not restricted to\n\nphysical state, but also mental state of mind and it is argued that\n\nnevertheless         a    broad    interpretation       must      be    given     to   the\n\ncircumstances in which a person can be so compelled for recording\n\nof statement. Additionally, the term ‘to be a witness’ would take\n\nwithin its fold ‘to appear as a witness’ and it is said that it must\n\nencompass           protection     even    outside      Court      in    investigations\n\nconducted by authorities such as the ED47. It was also argued that\n\nthis      protection      should    extend       beyond      statements        that    are\n\nconfession, such as incriminating statements which would furnish\n\na link in the chain of evidence against the person.</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1306519\" id=\"span_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_52\">45   Supra at <a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_121\">Footnote No.35</a>\n46   Supra at <a href=\"/doc/1306519/\" id=\"a_122\">Footnote No.43\n47 M.P.

It is further pointed out that\n\nthe ED as a matter of course records statement even when the\n\naccused person is in custody. In some circumstances, a person is\n\nnot even informed of the capacity in which he/she is being\n\nsummoned. What makes it worse is the fact that the ED claims the\n\nnon-application of Chapter XII of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_123\">Cr.P.C</a>.

Hence, advocating the\n\nprotection of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_124\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution, it is submitted that all\n\nsafeguards and protections are rendered illusionary.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(xxii) Finally, an argument is raised that <a href=\"/doc/133259215/\" id=\"a_125\">Section 50</a> of the PMLA is\n\nmuch worse than <a href=\"/doc/11056377/\" id=\"a_126\">Section 67</a> of the Narcotic Drugs and Psychotropic\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">48 Even the applicability of Prevention of Money-Laundering (Forms, Search and Seizure or\nFreezing and the Manner of Forwarding the Reasons and Material to the Adjudicating Authority,\nImpounding and Custody of Records and the Period of Retention) Rules, 2005.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">\f                                               44</span>\n\nSubstance Act, 198549. <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_127\">Further, the NDPS Act</a> is the underlying\n\nreason for the PMLA and this Court in Tofan Singh50, in no\n\nuncertain terms, has given protection in respect of confessional\n\nstatement even in the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_128\">NDPS Act</a>.                     The much harder and harsher\n\npunishment of death in the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_129\">NDPS Act</a> is also contrasted against the\n\nPMLA.

Next submissions were advanced by Mr. Sidharth Luthra,\n\nlearned senior counsel on the same lines.                       He argued that the\n\ncurrent procedure envisaged under the PMLA is violative of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_136\">Article\n\n21</a> of the Constitution of India. The procedure established by law\n\nhas to be in the form of a statute or delegated legislation and pass\n\nthe muster of the constitutional protections.52 The <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_137\">Cr.P.C</a>. has\n\nseveral safeguards in respect of arrested investigation; they are also\n\nrooted in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_138\">Cr.P.C</a>. of 1898. They are reflective of the constitutional\n\nprotections.       The manual, circulars, guidelines of the ED are\n\nexecutive in nature and as such, cannot be used for the curtailment\n\nof an individual liberty. Under the PMLA, there is no visible sign of\n\nthese protections against police&#x27;s power of search and arrest; it is in\n\nstark contrast with the constitutional protections given also the\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/656741/\" id=\"a_139\">52Gudikanti Narasimhulu &amp; Ors. vs. Public Prosecutor, High</a> Court of Andhra Pradesh, (1978) 1\nSCC 240 (paras 1, 2, 10)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">\f                                                46</span>\n\nreverse presumption against innocence at stage of bail under <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_140\">Section\n\n45</a> of the PMLA.

Further, the PMLA has two sets of processes\n\nfor     attachment and             confiscation which is subject to      final\n\ndetermination.           Hence, lack of judicial oversight is irrational, as\n\nattachment is a step-in aid for final adjudication. In absence of\n\nsafeguards and supply of ECIR, a fair investigation is not a statutory\n\nobligation.

The onerous bail conditions under <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_179\">Section\n\n45</a> are in the nature of jurisdiction of suspicion that is preventive\n\ndetention under <a href=\"/doc/825787/\" id=\"a_180\">Article 22(3)</a> to 22(7), which in itself has various\n\nsafeguards which are absent in the PMLA.                   Further, post 2019\n\namendment, making money-laundering a cognizable and non-\n\nbailable offence, there are no more checks and balances present\n\nagainst the exercise of discretion by the ED.              Magisterial oversight\n\nhas been revoked; also, supervision envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_181\">Section 17</a> is\n\nthat of the executive which is against the rule of law and right of fair\n\ntrial65.

However, the safeguards provided are nowhere\n\nuniform. The same is unreasonable and manifestly arbitrary66. It is\n\nalso to be noted that the PMLA does not expressly exclude the\n\napplication of Chapter XII of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_187\">Cr.P.C</a>. and as such, ambiguity\n\nmust be interpreted in a way that protects fundamental rights of the\n\npeople67.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"183165917\" id=\"span_72\">(iii) The next leg of the argument is to the effect that subsequent\n\namendment cannot revive <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_188\">Section 45</a>, which was struck down as\n\nunconstitutional by the decision in Nikesh Tarachand Shah68.

However, it is\n\npointed out that it has been held that such onerous conditions were\n\nnecessary only in certain kinds of cases - for example, terrorist\n\noffences, which are clearly a distinct and incompatible offence in the\n\nface of PMLA.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155274324\" id=\"span_78\">Further, it is argued that even under the Unlawful\n\nActivities (Prevention) Act, 196775, the Court has to examine only\n\n\n\n\n70   For short, <a href=\"/doc/155274324/\" id=\"a_196\">“ICCPR”\n71(2010)   9 SCC 189 (paras 27 and 28)\n72 Satender Kumar Antil vs. Central Bureau of Investigation &amp; Anr.</a>, (2021) 10 SCC 773 and\nclarificatory order dated 16.12.2021 in MA No. 1849/2021\n73   For short, “<a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_197\">TADA Act</a>”\n74   For short, “MCOCA”\n75   For short, “UAPA”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">\f                                                52</span>\n\nwhether the allegation is prima facie true while granting bail, but in\n\ncase of PMLA, the Court has to reach a finding that there are\n\nreasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not guilty before\n\ngranting bail. Thus, as soon as charges are framed, a person is\n\ndisentitled to apply for bail as prima facie case is made out, which\n\nhelps in achieving the purpose of preventive detention without\n\nprocedure established by law76.                      Further, these deep restrictive\n\nconditions even under the UAPA and the NDPS Act are restricted\n\nonly to parts of these Acts and not to the whole of them. However,\n\nthe same is not the case under the PMLA, as it is applicable to all\n\npredicate offences. Such an approach ignores crucial distinctions\n\nsuch as nature, gravity and punishment of different offences in the\n\nSchedule of PMLA and treats unequals as equals. This is in violation\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_198\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.</span> Reliance is also placed on\n\nUnited States vs. Anthony Salerno77, where restrictive bail\n\nprovisions are permitted in pre-trial detention because of the\n\npresence of detailed procedural safeguards. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1319486\" id=\"span_80\">Still, it is argued, that\n\nsuch        restrictive      bail   provisions        cannot      oust the      ability   of\n\n\n\n76   Ayya alias <a href=\"/doc/1319486/\" id=\"a_199\">Ayub vs. State of U.P. &amp; Anr.</a>, (1989) 1 SCC 374 (paras 11-17)\n77   107 S.Ct. 2095 (1987)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">\f                                               53</span>\n\nConstitutional Court to grant bail on the ground of violation of Part\n\nIII of the Constitution78.

He has gone into the legislative history of\n\nthe Act and stated that originally the presumption was raised even\n\nprior to the trial and state of charge, this was diluted by the\n\namendment of 2013 thereafter the presumption would only apply\n\nafter the framing of charges.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">(i)    Learned senior counsel submits that the wording of <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_208\">Section 24</a>\n\nrefers to formal framing of charges under <a href=\"/doc/35598/\" id=\"a_209\">Section 211</a> of the Cr.P.C.\n\nFor this submission, he relies on the speech of the Minister\n\nintroducing the amendment in the Parliament. It has been stated\n\nthat presumption is raised in relation to the fact of money-\n\nlaundering. Such a presumption cannot be raised in relation to an\n\nessential ingredient of an offence. The commission of an offence, as\n\nsuch, cannot be presumed. In reference to <a href=\"/doc/1693109/\" id=\"a_210\">Section 4</a> of the 1872\n\nAct, distinction between sub-sections (a) and (b) of <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_211\">Section 24</a> is\n\nhighlighted, wherein the former states - ‘shall presume’ and the\n\nlatter states - ‘may presume’.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">(ii)   It is urged that post amendment also there is no requirement\n\nfor the prosecution to prove any facts once the charges are framed.\n\nThe entire burden of disproving the case, as set out in the complaint,\n\ninverts onto the accused. It is, hence, contrary to the requirement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">\f                                  55</span>\n\nof proof of foundational facts, as is seen in other legislations. Such\n\nan inversion is not present in any other statute. It is stated that\n\neven in the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_212\">NDPS Act</a>, where no requirement of foundational facts\n\nwas provided, this Court has read such necessity into the Act. As\n\nfor sub-section (b), it is pointed out that the ‘may presume’ provision\n\neliminates the safeguards of sub-section (a) and provides no\n\nguidance as to when a presumption is to be invoked. The learned\n\ncounsel also points the discrepancy that the word ‘authority’\n\nappearing in <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_213\">Section 24</a>, which also appears in <a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_214\">Section 48</a>, is\n\ndistinctive in nature and that <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 24</a> absurdly allows an\n\ninvestigator to presume the commission of an offence. This is clearly\n\narbitrary and de hors logic. In light of the same, the constitutional\n\nvires of the section are challenged or a reading down to fulfil the\n\nconstitutional mandate is pressed for.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">(iii) The next point of attack for Dr. Singhvi, learned senior counsel\n\nis the constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_216\">Sections 17</a> and <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_217\">18</a>.       The absence of\n\nsafeguards in lieu of searches and seizures is canvassed. It has been\n\npointed out that such searches or seizures can take place even\n\nwithout an FIR having been registered or a complaint being filed\n\nbefore a competent Court. Foremost, the legislative history of these\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">\f                                  56</span>\n\ntwo Sections is pointed out. It is shown that originally the search\n\nand seizure was to be conducted after the filing of a chargesheet or\n\ncomplaint in the predicate offence. Thereafter, the protection was\n\ndiluted by the 2009 amendment, wherein it was provided that the\n\nsearch and seizure operations would take place only after forwarding\n\na report to the Magistrate under <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 157</a> of the Cr.P.C. It was\n\nonly in 2019 that these final safeguards were also completely\n\nremoved by the Finance (No. 2) Act, 2019. The effect, it is argued, is\n\nsuch that the ED has unfettered powers to commit searches and\n\nseizures without any investigation having been done in the predicate\n\noffence, and sometimes even without an FIR being registered. There\n\nare no prerequisites or safeguards as the ED can now simply walk\n\ninto a premises. Even for non-cognizable offences, the ED need not\n\nwait for the filing of a complaint before a Court. In this way, in the\n\nabsence of any credible information to investigate, the ED cannot be\n\nallowed to use such uncanalized power. The magisterial oversight\n\ncannot be replaced by the limited oversight of the Adjudicating\n\nAuthority, as they have no real control over the ED, especially in\n\ncase of criminal investigations. Thus, it is submitted that such lack\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">\f                                        57</span>\n\nof effective checks and balances is unreasonable and violative of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_219\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_220\">21</a> of the Constitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">(iv) Our attention is also drawn to the Prevention of Money-\n\nLaundering (Forms, Search and Seizure or Freezing and the Manner\n\nof Forwarding the Reasons and Material to the Adjudicating\n\nAuthority, Impounding and Custody of Records and the Period of\n\nRetention) Rules, 200582, and it is prayed that this Court must\n\nclarify that these rules are not ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_221\">Sections 17</a> and <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_222\">18</a> of the\n\nPMLA. Pertinently, they relate to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_223\">Cr.P.C</a>. being\n\napplicable to searches under the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">(v)      Next leg of submissions challenges the vires of the second\n\nproviso of <a href=\"/doc/192126/\" id=\"a_224\">Section 5(1)</a>, as it allows for attachment independent of\n\nthe existence of a predicate offence, given that such property might\n\nnot even be proceeds of crime. Though an emergency procedure, no\n\nthreshold had to be met and the first proviso has no application. It\n\nis also submitted that the proviso cannot travel beyond the scope of\n\nthe main provision. Our attention is drawn to the legislative history;\n\nit is stated that the PMLA did not originally contain the second\n\n\n\n82   For short, “Seizure Rules, 2005”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">\f                                           58</span>\n\nproviso. Attachment was only to be done after filing of chargesheet\n\nin the predicate offence. For the first time, in 2009, this proviso was\n\nadded, to avoid frustration of the proceedings. It is submitted that\n\nthis proviso has no anchor to either the scheduled offence or the\n\nproceeds of crime. It is at the mere satisfaction of the officer. In this\n\nway, it is submitted, attachment of property of any person can be\n\nmade, with no fetters. Our attention is also drawn to the use of word\n\n‘any’ for person and property and its distinction from the term\n\n‘proceeds of crime’, having a direct nexus with the ambit of the main\n\nSection. It is argued that it is not to be mixed with any offence but\n\nonly scheduled offences. The ED is alleged to employ this language\n\nin attaching property purchased much before the commission of\n\nscheduled offences, to the extent not having any nexus.                            It is\n\nsubmitted that there has to be a link between the second proviso to\n\nthe proceeds of crime and scheduled offence being investigated\n\nunder a specific ECIR before the ED.83\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"106041\" id=\"span_90\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"68571\" id=\"span_91\">(vi) Submissions with respect to <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_225\">Section 8</a> of the PMLA maintain\n\nthat <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_226\">Section 8(4)</a> allows the ED to take possession of the attached\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/68571/\" id=\"a_227\">83Dwarka Prasad vs. Dwarka Das Saraf</a>, (1976) 1 SCC 128, Also see: <a href=\"/doc/106041/\" id=\"a_228\">Satnam Singh &amp; Ors. vs.\nPunjab &amp; Haryana High</a> Court and Ors., (1997) 3 SCC 353\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">\f                                        59</span>\n\nproperty at the stage of confirmation of provisional attachment made\n\nby the Adjudicating Authority. It is submitted that this deprivation\n\nof a person’s right to property at such an early stage without the due\n\nprocess of law, is unconstitutional. Further the period of attachment\n\nunder   <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_229\">Section    8(3)(a)</a>   of   the        PMLA   is   also   arbitrary   and\n\nunreasonable. To make good the point, the relevant legislative\n\nhistory is pointed out. The original enactment where provisional\n\nattachment would continue during the pendency of proceedings\n\nrelated to ‘any scheduled offence’. Thereafter in 2012, the same was\n\nchanged to ‘any offence under the PMLA’, followed by 2018\n\namendment – ‘a period of ninety days during investigation of the\n\noffence or during pendency of proceedings under the PMLA’, and\n\nfinally by 2019 amendment the increase from ‘ninety days’ to ‘three\n\nhundred and sixty-five days’.            We are also taken through the\n\nelaborate process of attachment of property.                    Thereby, it is\n\nhighlighted that the ED can take possession of property after a single\n\nadjudicatory process, wherein there is no oversight over the ED. It\n\nis stated that such alienation of property without any proceedings\n\nhaving been       brought before the           Court is undoubtedly an\n\nunconstitutional act. As for <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_230\">Section 8(3)(a)</a> clarification is sought in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">\f                                                  60</span>\n\nlight of the confusion that it allows for a continuation of the\n\nconfirmed provisional attachment for three hundred and sixty-five\n\ndays or during the pendency of proceedings under the PMLA. This\n\nmight lead to a reading where the ED has a period of three hundred\n\nand sixty-five days to file its complaint.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">(vii) Learned counsel then referred to the Prevention of Money-\n\nLaundering (Taking Possession of Attached or Frozen Properties\n\nConfirmed by the Adjudicating Authority) Rules, 201384 wherein\n\nspecific challenge is raised against Rules 4(4), 5(3), 5(4) and 5(6).\n\nThe main ground of challenge is disproportionality, similar to the\n\nattachment issue, transfer of attached shares and mutual funds,\n\ndepressing of value of property, eviction of owners of a movable\n\nproperty, possession of productive assets along with gross income,\n\nall monetary benefit is stated to be arbitrary, reasonable, absurd and\n\ndisproportionate. Herein, it is highlighted that various anomalies\n\nmay crop up, such as taking of the shares and the ED becoming the\n\nmajority shareholder in corporations, attachment of properties\n\nworth far more than the value of proceeds of crime. Under Section\n\n\n\n\n84   For short, “Taking Possession Rules, 2013”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">\f                                               61</span>\n\n2(1)(zb), the expression “value” is defined as fair market value on the\n\ndate of acquisition and not fair market value on date of attachment.\n\nArguably, property bought years ago is thereby undervalued by the\n\nED.        Attachment of immovable property and eviction in case of\n\nunregistered            leases   is also       challenged.   To challenge   this\n\ndisproportionate imposition and restrictions, reliance is placed on\n\nShayara Bano85and Anuradha Bhasin vs. Union of India &amp;\n\nOrs.86.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155274324\" id=\"span_95\">(viii) It is then urged by the learned counsel that <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_231\">Section 45(1)</a> of the\n\nPMLA, reverses the presumption of innocence at the stage of bail as\n\nan accused.

It was also stated that it is\n\na near impossibility to get bail as under the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_240\">UAPA, TADA Act</a>, or the\n\nPrevention of Terrorism Act, 200292.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_56\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">5. Mr. Mukul Rohatgi, learned senior counsel was next to argue on\n\nbehalf of private parties. He urged that the Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_241\">Section\n\n44</a> is contrary to <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_242\">Section 3</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_243\">Section 2(1)(u)</a>, hence, the same\n\nis unsustainable and arbitrary in the eyes of law. Special emphasis\n\nwas laid on the expression “shall not be dependent upon any order\n\nby the Trial Court in the scheduled offence”. It was argued that both\n\ntrials may be tried by the same Court. In such a case, <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_244\">Section 3</a>\n\noffence cannot be given pre-eminence, as that would run contrary to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_245\">Section 3</a> and would be manifestly arbitrary, given the fact that an\n\nacquittal in the scheduled offence cannot lead to one being found\n\nguilty for the derivative offence of money-laundering. A direct link\n\nbetween the proceeds of crime and <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_246\">Section 3</a> offence was also\n\n\n92   For short, “POTA”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">\f                                             64</span>\n\nhighlighted.         It was submitted that the Special Court cannot\n\ncontinue with the trial for <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_247\">Section 3</a> offence once acquittal in the\n\npredicate offence takes place. <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_248\">Section 44</a> unmistakably provides for\n\nthe Special Court trial of money-laundering. It was pointed out that\n\nit is normal that if one is acquitted for the predicate offence, the\n\nmoney-laundering procedure could still go on. This is contrary to\n\nthe definition under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_249\">Section 3</a>, which states that money-laundering\n\nis inextricably linked to the predicate offence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"263845\" id=\"span_102\">(i)      It was also pointed out that the usual practice is of filing an\n\nECIR on the same day or right after the FIR has been filed by\n\nreplicating it almost verbatim. Canvassing for proper procedure and\n\ninvestigation before filing of the ECIR and initiation of the process\n\nunder the PMLA, reference was also made to other Acts, such as\n\nSmugglers and Foreign Exchange Manipulators Act, 197693, FERA\n\nor Conservation of Foreign Exchange and Prevention of Smuggling\n\nActivities Act, 197494 and the 1962 Act, being Acts which would not\n\nsubsist alone or by themselves without the predicate offences95.\n\n\n\n93   For short, “SAFEMA”\n94   For short, <a href=\"/doc/263845/\" id=\"a_250\">“COFEPOSA”\n95   Barendra Kumar Ghosh vs. The King Emperor</a>, 1924 SCC OnLine PC 49 : AIR 1925 PC 1</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">\f                                      65</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">(ii)   It was also argued that often the ED widens the investigation\n\nbeyond what is contained in the chargesheet.

The true meaning of the definition under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_251\">Section 3</a> of the PMLA was proposed to be divided into three\n\ncomponents        of   predicate   offence,     proceeds   of   crime   and\n\nprojecting/claiming as untainted. It was conceded that even\n\nabetment would form a part of the offence and as a consequence,\n\nwhoever attempts, assists, abets, incites - are all covered by the\n\nsame. For predicate offence and <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_252\">Section 3</a>, it was stated that if the\n\nformer is gone, the latter cannot subsist.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_60\">(iii) Next argument raised pertained to the ambit and meaning of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_253\">Section 3</a>. It was submitted that mere possession or concealment of\n\nproceeds of crime will not constitute money-laundering and this was\n\nbolstered by the phrase ‘projecting or claiming as untainted\n\nproperty’. The “and” was stated to be a watertight compartment.\n\nThe Finance Minister’s 2012 Rajya Sabha Speech was also relied\n\nupon to showcase how “and projecting” was an essential element.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">6. Mr.     Amit    Desai,   learned    senior    counsel   also   advanced\n\nsubmissions on behalf of private parties.

He relies\n\non the Statement of Objects and Reasons of the Act97, followed by\n\nthe initial ambit of <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_254\">Sections 2(1)(p)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_255\">2(1)(u)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_256\">3</a>, which were\n\namended by the 2013 amendment.                           It is stated that the Act\n\npresupposes the commission of a crime which is the predicate\n\noffence; hence the questions to be answered by this Court are related\n\nto retrospectivity. Firstly - whether authorities can proceed against\n\nan accused when commission of the predicate offence predates the\n\naddition of the said offences to the Schedule of the PMLA? Secondly\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_62\">- whether the authorities can proceed against the properties\n\nobtained or projected prior to the commission of an offence under\n\nthis Act?       Thirdly - whether authorities can proceed when the\n\npredicate offence and the projecting predate the commencement of\n\nthis Act?

This, it is maintained\n\ncannot fit into the term “proceeds of crime” under <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_260\">Section 2(1)(u)</a>,\n\nthe same having been done prior to 2009. It has also been submitted\n\nthat for the determination of money-laundering under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_261\">Section 3</a> or\n\nany other provision of the Act, the relevant time has to be the time\n\nof the commission of the scheduled offence. The rationale being that\n\nonly the presence of a scheduled offence can lead to the generation\n\nof proceeds of crime and, hence, in return the offence of money-\n\nlaundering can be committed. Thus, in a way it is suggested that\n\nthe starting point for a conviction for <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_262\">Section 3</a> might be the\n\ncommission of a scheduled offence. The argument in respect of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">\f                                                  68</span>\n\nprotections provided by the Constitution under <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_263\">Article 20(1)</a>, as per\n\nwhich ingredients for an offence must exist on the day the crime is\n\ncommitted or detected, have also been impressed in opposition of\n\nany retrospective or retroactive application of the Act. To bolster the\n\narguments, reliance has been placed on the decisions of this Court\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/1604750/\" id=\"a_264\">Soni Devrajbhai Babubhai vs. State of Gujarat and Ors.98</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/66237433/\" id=\"a_265\">Mahipal Singh vs. Central Bureau of Investigation &amp; Anr.99</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/25903032/\" id=\"a_266\">Tech Mahindra Limited vs. Joint Director, Directorate of\n\nEnforcement</a>, Hyderabad &amp; Ors.100, and Gadi Nagavekata\n\nSatyanarayana                 vs.     Deputy           Director       Directorate        of\n\nEnforcement101 and that of Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/138056817/\" id=\"a_267\">Arun Kumar\n\nMishra          vs.      Directorate       of      Enforcement102</a>,       M/s.     <a href=\"/doc/78259539/\" id=\"a_268\">Ajanta\n\nMerchants Pvt.

It is also urged that proceeds of crime can only be generated\n\nfrom the commission of a predicate offence and the commencement\n\nof investigation arises only if a predicate offence has generated such\n\nproceeds of crime only subsequent to the inclusion of the predicate\n\noffence to the Schedule of the PMLA. Another point that has been\n\nhighlighted is that the projecting, if done prior to the date of\n\ninclusion of the offence to the Schedule, the same cannot be\n\ncontinuing and as such, is stated to be stillborn for the purposes of\n\nthe PMLA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">(iii) It is urged that for the purposes of bail, it is settled law\n\nthat offences punishable for less than seven years allows a person\n\nto be set free on bail. As such, the liberty as enunciated by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_270\">Article\n\n21</a> of the Constitution cannot be defeated by such an Act. Thus,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_271\">Section 45(2)</a> of the PMLA is contrary to general principles of bail\n\nand the Constitution of India. It is also pointed out that <a href=\"/doc/848468/\" id=\"a_272\">Section 437</a>\n\nof the Cr.P.C. imposing similar conditions as <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_273\">Section 45(2)</a> restricts\n\nit to offences punishable with either life imprisonment or death.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">\f                                  70</span>\n\nUnder no condition can it be said that the bail conditions under the\n\nPMLA, imposing maximum seven years, are reasonable. Without\n\nprejudice to the aforementioned argument, it was stated that <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_274\">Section\n\n45(2)</a> could only be applicable to bail applications before the Special\n\nCourt and the special powers under <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_275\">Section 439</a> Cr.P.C.         It was\n\nsubmitted that in light of the same, special powers be given to the\n\nSpecial Court under the PMLA, as these provisions, draconian in\n\nnature, were contemplated only in Acts, such as TADA Act, POTA,\n\nMCOCA &amp; NDPS Act, since securing the presence was difficult in all\n\nof the above.   Further, unless <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_276\">Section 3</a> was to be restricted to\n\norganised crime syndicate, which was in fact the real intent, the bail\n\nprovisions are liable to be struck down.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_69\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_70\">7. Mr. S. Niranjan Reddy, learned senior counsel contends that it\n\nis essential to first understand as to whether money-laundering is a\n\nstandalone offence or dependent on the scheduled offence?          He\n\npoints out that the ED has maintained the former stance. It has\n\nbeen pointed out that this view has been rejected by the High Courts\n\nof Delhi, Allahabad and Telangana.         On the contrary, the High\n\nCourts of Madras and Bombay have accepted such a view. It has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">\f                                 71</span>\n\nbeen added that the ED&#x27;s contention is based on the Explanation\n\nadded to <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_277\">Section 44(1)(d)</a> by the 2019 amendment.        Concededly,\n\nthough there are certain exemptions in <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_278\">Section 8(7)</a>, it is contended,\n\nthat the same are only for special circumstances. Learned counsel\n\nthen refers to the sequence of conducting the matters and points out\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_279\">Sections 43(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_280\">44(1)</a>, whereby the Special Court can try the\n\nscheduled offence, as well as, the money-laundering offence. He\n\npoints out that due to different findings of different High Courts,\n\ncertain questions have arisen as to the sequence of conducting the\n\nsaid two cases. The High Courts of Jharkhand and Kerala have\n\ntaken a view that both matters can be tried simultaneously; there is\n\nno necessity to hold back the trial of money-laundering until the\n\nscheduled offence has been tried. It has been submitted that the\n\nHigh Court of Kerala finds that the offence of money-laundering is\n\ndependent on the scheduled offence. The High Court for the State\n\nTelangana, on the other hand, finds money-laundering completely\n\nindependent of the scheduled offence.     To drive the point home,\n\nattention is drawn towards <a href=\"/doc/66955/\" id=\"a_281\">Section 212</a> of the IPC, where the High\n\nCourts have taken a view that unless the original offence is proved,\n\nthe person harbouring the accused cannot be sentenced. However,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">\f                                 72</span>\n\nit is also pointed out that Section 212 can be tried simultaneously\n\nwith the original offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">(i)    Additionally, it has been submitted that <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_282\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_283\">Section 3</a> of the PMLA have been given a very expansive meaning,\n\nwhereby people who do not have knowledge or have not participated,\n\nbeing totally unrelated third parties, are also being roped in to the\n\ninvestigations.   The culpability has to be maintained.       Wrong\n\ninterpretation is given to proceeds of crime to be any property even\n\nobtained or derived indirectly. Persons who have not committed the\n\nscheduled offence deriving certain indirect benefits, even without\n\nknowledge, based on <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_284\">Section 24</a> presumption are held to be guilty of\n\nlaundering money.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">(ii)   Further, the question of retrospectivity has also been\n\naddressed, whereby after the 2019 amendment, money-laundering\n\nis now said to be a continuing offence connected with the proceeds\n\nof crime.   It is urged that the ED contends that prosecution or\n\nattachment can take place irrespective of whether the alleged offence\n\nwas committed even prior to enactment in 2002, irrespective of the\n\naddition of the predicate offence in the PMLA Schedule. It is\n\nsubmitted that there are various amendments which are substantive\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">\f                                 73</span>\n\nin   nature,   being    given   retrospective   effect,   such   as\n\n<a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_285\">Sections 2(1)(u)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_286\">3</a>, <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_287\">8</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_288\">24</a>, <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_289\">44</a>, etc. It has also been brought to our\n\nnotice that prior to the 2013 amendment in the context of <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_290\">Section 8</a>,\n\nthe High Court of Andhra Pradesh, the Madras High Court and the\n\nHigh Court of Gujarat have held that attachment causes civil\n\nconsequences of confiscation. Meaning that in case a scheduled\n\noffence is committed prior to the enactment of the PMLA or inclusion\n\nof certain offences in its Schedule, attachment or confiscation can\n\ngo on. However, since then, the amendment has brought about a\n\nnew legal question.    Today, the line between civil and criminal\n\nconsequences has changed, since <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_291\">Section 8</a> now is dependent upon\n\none being held guilty for money-laundering. Hence, it cannot be\n\napplied retrospectively for predicate offences or scheduled offences\n\ncommitted prior to the PMLA enactment. Reference has also been\n\nmade to the finding of the Hyderabad High Court where <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_292\">Section 8(5)</a>\n\nbeing quasi criminal, has been found to be prospective.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_73\">8.

It is\n\nstated that the stage at which a person is guaranteed the\n\nconstitutional right under <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_302\">Article 20(3)</a>, cannot be made malleable\n\nthrough legislation. It is stated that even though the PMLA is a\n\ncomplaint-based procedure, by way of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_303\">Section 50</a>, one cannot ignore\n\nthe pre-complaint stage.               As such, <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_304\">Section 50</a> must be rendered\n\nunconstitutional. Further, it is argued that the ED practice is a\n\nperverse incentive structure for constitutional infringement where\n\nan accused is trapped and sweeping interrogations are conducted\n\naimed at justifying the summons issued.                         In respect of <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_305\">Section\n\n44(1)(d)</a>, it is stated that the right to a fair trial is taken away and\n\nthis provision irreversibly prejudices the accused in the trial\n\nadjudicating the predicate offence.108\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"668282\" id=\"span_124\">(ii)     Further, the Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_306\">Section 44(1)(d)</a> requires the two\n\ntrials to be conducted before the Special Court, but as separate\n\ntrials, is said to render the requirement of a fair trial impossible. <a href=\"/doc/668282/\" id=\"a_307\">To\n\n\n\n\n108   Nahar Singh Yadav &amp; Anr. vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.</a>, (2011) 1 SCC 307\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">\f                                               76</span>\n\nbolster this ground, it is said that when a judge receives evidence\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_308\">Section 50</a> of the PMLA in case of money-laundering, he\n\ncannot remain an independent authority when deciding the\n\npredicate offence based on the material placed before him. Thus,\n\nthis paradoxical provision forms a complete absurdity for a judge\n\ndealing with two different sets of rights for the same accused\n\nregarding the connected facts. That is for every predicate offence\n\nwhich would have otherwise been tried by a Magistrate, the\n\ninvestigation by the ED will tend to influence the mind of the judge109.\n\nFurther, reliance has also been placed on Suo Motu Writ (Crl.) No. 1\n\nof 2017 in Re: To issue certain guidelines regarding inadequacies\n\nand deficiencies in criminal trials110. The Court has incorporated\n\nthe Draft Rules of Criminal Practice, 2021 which have been\n\ncirculated for adoption by all High Courts. It is also argued that\n\n<a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_309\">Section 44</a> takes away the right of appeal from the predicate offences\n\ntriable by the Magistrate&#x27;s Court111.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">\n\n\n109   Hanumant Govind Nargundkar &amp; Anr. vs. State of Madhya Pradesh, AIR 1952 SC 343 (para\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"873948\" id=\"span_126\">10)\n110Criminal Trials Guidelines Regarding Inadequacies and Deficiencies, In re, vs. State of Andhra\nPradesh &amp; Ors., (supra <a href=\"/doc/873948/\" id=\"a_310\">at Footnote No.12)\n111   Himanshu Singh Sabharwal vs. State of Madhya Pradesh &amp; Ors.</a>, (2008) 3 SCC 602</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">\f                                             77</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"42511\" id=\"span_128\">(iii) It is urged that the PMLA creates an overbroad frame with no\n\nfetters on investigation. The refusal to provide a copy of the ECIR\n\ncreating an opacity surrounding the usage of the ED Manual is also\n\nunder challenge. Section 4(b)(v) of the Right to Information Act,\n\n2005112 is pressed into service to showcase that every public\n\nauthority is obligated to publish within 120 days of enactment of the\n\nAct - the rules, regulations, instructions, manuals and records held\n\nby it or its employees for discharge of its functions. Contrary to the\n\nabove-mentioned provisions, the ED Manual is said to be a mystery\n\nfor the general public. Reference is also made to the decision of the\n\nBombay High Court, wherein the Maharashtra Police was asked to\n\nprovide a copy of the police manual in response to an RTI\n\napplication113. It is submitted that such non-disclosure of the ED\n\nManual is unsustainable in law. It makes the securing of pre-trial\n\nrights of an accused difficult. Even the CBI manual which is based\n\non a statutory provision of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_311\">Cr.P.C</a>., has been found by this Court\n\nto be necessary and to be adhered scrupulously by the CBI114.\n\n\n112   For short, “<a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_312\">RTI Act</a>”\n113State of Maharashtra vs. Chief Information Commissioner &amp; Anr., 2018 SCC OnLine Bom\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">1199</span>\n114Vineet Narain &amp; Ors. vs. Union of India &amp; Anr., (1998) 1 SCC 226; Also see: <a href=\"/doc/42511/\" id=\"a_313\">Shashikant vs.\nCentral Bureau of Investigation &amp; Ors.</a>, (2007) 1 SCC 630; Central Bureau of Investigation vs.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">\f                                              78</span>\n\nSimilarly,        other       authorities,    such      as    the    Central       Vigilance\n\nCommission, Income Tax authorities, authorities under the 1962\n\nAct, police authorities, jail authorities, are all governed by manual\n\npublished by them. Thus, it is only the ED which follows a distinct\n\napproach of non-disclosure.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">(iv) It has also been argued that the Schedule of the PMLA renders\n\nseveral bailable offences as non-bailable when this Court has\n\nrepeatedly held that bail is the rule and jail is the exception115.\n\nPredicate offences which under their original act such as the Bonded\n\nLabour System (Abolition) Act, 1976116, are bailable but on the\n\napplication of the PMLA, become non-bailable. The intention and\n\nprovision of the underlying special Act, hence, becomes otiose by the\n\noverbroad provisions of the PMLA. In another breath, it is argued\n\nthat the attachment procedure under the PMLA runs contrary to the\n\nprovisions contained in the predicate offence. It is also perplexing,\n\nas the underlying statute itself contain the procedure to attach\n\n\n\nAshok Kumar Aggarwal, (2014) 14 SCC 295; and State of Jharkhand through SP, Central Bureau\nof Investigation vs. Lalu Prasad Yadav alias Lalu Prasad, (2017) 8 SCC 1.\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"542273\" id=\"span_131\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1563495\" id=\"span_132\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"8258\" id=\"span_133\"><a href=\"/doc/8258/\" id=\"a_314\">115State of Rajasthan, Jaipur vs. Balchand</a> alia Baliay, (1977) 4 SCC 308; Also see: <a href=\"/doc/1563495/\" id=\"a_315\">Sanjay\nChandra vs. Central Bureau of Investigation</a>, (2012) 1 SCC 40; <a href=\"/doc/542273/\" id=\"a_316\">State of Kerela vs. Raneef</a>, (2011)\n1 SCC 784 (para 15).</span></span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_82\">116   For short, “1976 Act”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">\f                                      79</span>\n\nillegal proceeds of crime.        Aid of the UAPA and Securities and\n\nExchange Board of India Act, 1992117 is taken to buttress that while\n\nunder the predicate offence, attachment can take place only after\n\nthe conviction, <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_317\">Section 5</a> of the PMLA enables attachment of property\n\nprior to conviction. This creates two different standards and two\n\ndifferent criminal attachment proceedings for essentially the same\n\noffence. Even the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_318\">Cr.P.C</a>. provides for depriving criminals of the fruit\n\nof the crimes and allows for the true owner of the property to be\n\nrestored with the position thereof by way of Section 452(5).\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_83\">(v)       The next point argued is in respect of the adjudicatory paralysis\n\nin the Appellate Tribunal. It is submitted that it is one of the only\n\nsafeguards in this draconian law to provide an oversight to prevent\n\nabuse of mechanism of attachment. Even this oversight has been\n\nrendered redundant since there has been no appointment of a\n\nchairperson or members of the said Tribunal since 21.09.2019.\n\nThus, making the Tribunal redundant. Further, it is stated that\n\ntaking the possession at the stage when only a provisional\n\nattachment has been made, can cause great hardship and financial\n\n\n\n\n117   For short, “<a href=\"/doc/1365176/\" id=\"a_319\">SEBI Act</a>”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">\f                                   80</span>\n\nruin, amounting to virtually declaring a person guilty and is\n\navoidable.   Further, certain official data has been brought to our\n\nattention to demonstrate the ineffectiveness of the unconstitutional\n\nlegislations, where raids have increased each financial year and, yet,\n\nsince 2005 the number of convictions till 2015-16 has remained zero\n\nand, thereafter, reached a maximum of four in 2018-19.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">9.   Then, Mr. Aabad Ponda, learned senior counsel contended that\n\nwithout prejudice to all the submissions, <a href=\"/doc/977853/\" id=\"a_320\">Section 50(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/301753/\" id=\"a_321\">Section\n\n63(2)(a)</a> and (c) of the PMLA, insofar as they relate to the accused\n\npersons, are ultra vires being violative of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_322\">Articles 20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_323\">21</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. He submitted that under the current scheme\n\nof the Act, a scheduled offence requires a prior FIR. A person so\n\nnamed in the FIR would stand in the character of an accused person,\n\nand as such, he cannot be compelled to incriminate himself or\n\nproduce documents incriminating himself under <a href=\"/doc/977853/\" id=\"a_324\">Section 50(3)</a> of the\n\nPMLA. The next leg of the argument is to the extent that <a href=\"/doc/301753/\" id=\"a_325\">Section\n\n63(2)(c)</a>, which mandatorily penalises person for disobedience of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_326\">Section 50</a>, cannot be applicable to an accused person given the\n\nconstitutional protections of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_327\">Articles 20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_328\">21</a>, whereby he has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">\f                                   81</span>\n\nthe right to exercise his fundamental right to silence. We are also\n\nshown the analogous provisions similar to <a href=\"/doc/977853/\" id=\"a_329\">Section 50(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1830223/\" id=\"a_330\">50(4)</a> of\n\nthe PMLA in other statutes, such as Section 171A of the 1878 Act,\n\ninserted by Section 12 of the Sea Customs (Amendment) Act, 1955;\n\nSection 108 of the 1962 Act; Section 14 of the Central Excises and\n\nSalt Act, 1944118 and <a href=\"/doc/704436/\" id=\"a_331\">Section 40</a> of the FERA.       Learned counsel\n\nfurther argued and distinguished custom officers and other above\n\nreferred officers from the ED officers to the effect that they only\n\nrecover duty and do not investigate crimes like the ED officials. Even\n\notherwise, it is to be noted that even though <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_332\">Section 50</a> of the PMLA\n\nmay appear to be akin to summons issued under <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_333\">Section 18</a> of 1962\n\nAct and other above-mentioned statutes, however, there is a deep\n\ndifferentiation. For, when a person is summoned under the above-\n\nmentioned Acts, such as the 1962 Act, he is not in the shoes of an\n\naccused. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_137\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"690751\" id=\"span_138\">He only becomes an accused once an FIR or complaint has\n\nbeen filed before a Magistrate. This, however, he states, is not the\n\ncase under the PMLA. To drive home the point as to who stands in\n\nthe character of an accused, reference has been made to certain\n\nConstitution Bench decisions of this Court, which have already been\n\n\n118   For short, “CESA 1944 Act”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">\f                                                  82</span>\n\nreferred to by the previous learned counsel.

Mr.    Siddharth   Aggarwal,     learned   senior   counsel,    also\n\nappeared for the private parties.      His main opposition is to the\n\nretrospective application of the PMLA. Certain questions are raised\n\nwith respect to whether prosecution for money-laundering is\n\npermissible if the commission of scheduled offence and proceeds of\n\ncrime takes place prior to the PMLA coming into force; and, similarly,\n\nin a situation when it is committed prior to the offence being made\n\npart of the Schedule of the PMLA.

Further, he interprets <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_383\">Section\n\n44(1)(a)</a> to mean that the Special Court can only try the scheduled\n\noffence, but not together; it has to be separately tried as per the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_384\">Cr.P.C</a>. It is also said that the rationale behind this\n\nchange is difficult to fathom. On the other hand, it is pointed out\n\nthat the accused&#x27;s right of being tried as per the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_385\">Cr.P.C</a>., for\n\nscheduled offence is being violated, at least in respect of 37 out of\n\n58 scheduled offences of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_386\">IPC</a> noted in the Schedule to the 2002\n\nAct, are triable exclusively by a Magistrate of the First Class or any\n\nMagistrate.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1353689\" id=\"span_174\">In support of this argument, reliance has been placed\n\non <a href=\"/doc/1353689/\" id=\"a_387\">A.R. Antulay vs. R.S. Nayak &amp; Anr.134</a>. It is submitted that the\n\npresent interpretation of this section leads to the violation of the\n\nright to be tried by a Magistrate First Class, the right of a first appeal\n\nto Sessions Court under Section 374(3) and the right of revision to\n\nthe High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1571667/\" id=\"a_388\">Section 401</a> of the Cr.P.C. from the appellate\n\njudgment of the Sessions Court. This leads to a rather oppressive\n\ninterpretation where an accused who is not charged under the PMLA\n\noffence but only under the predicate offence is also tried by the\n\n\n134   AIR 1988 SC 1531 (para 59): (1988) 2 SCC 602\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">\f                                            90</span>\n\nSpecial Court.               This is also hit by the fact that several of the\n\nscheduled offences within the PMLA are themselves part of special\n\nstatutes which prescribe that they shall be tried by the Special Court\n\nestablished under those special statutes exclusively. For example,\n\nthe PC Act, the NDPS Act and the National Investigation Agency Act,\n\n2008135. Thus, in such a case the PMLA Special Court cannot have\n\npower to try offences punishable under those Acts. The phrase ‘any\n\nscheduled offences’ as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_389\">Section 44(1)(a)</a> of the\n\nPMLA is in a manifest conflict with these three statutes and, hence,\n\nliable to be struck down. Learned counsel also submits that the\n\nSection is a legal absurdity as to how a Special Court could try a\n\nscheduled offence before the commencement of the Act without\n\nwhich commencement of the Special Court has no existence. It is\n\nalso stated the discretion to choose which issue or scheduled offence\n\nto try before the Special Court lies only with the authority authorised\n\nto file a complaint under the PMLA, which is a discretionary and\n\nunfettered arbitrary power.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_96\">\n\n\n135   For short, “<a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_390\">NIA Act</a>”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_176\">\f                                            91</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_97\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"132269333\" id=\"span_177\">(i)      As regards <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_391\">Section 44(1)(c)</a>, it is urged that the same does not\n\nmandate disclosure of any reason for filing the application. Further,\n\nsuch an application can be moved at any stage of the proceedings\n\nfor the inquiry or trial of a scheduled offence. Such a provision\n\ncannot be read to allow committal at a stage when the trial is over\n\nand only the judgment remains to be delivered. This tantamounts\n\nto authorising exercise of administrative fiat in respect of subject\n\nmatter, which is in fact a quasi-judicial act. Similarly, even the\n\nMagistrate is not obligated to state reasons while deciding the\n\napplication and as such his order, if not reasoned, will be a nullity.\n\nThe interpretation of the words ‘commit’ and ‘committed’ is said to\n\nbe misconceived under <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_392\">Section 44(1)(c)</a>. It is urged that the use of\n\nthe word ‘committal’ is inappropriate and the real intention of the\n\npresent Section is a mere transfer of the case to the PMLA Special\n\nCourt. As such, it is submitted that the case be sent to the Special\n\nCourt which has already taken cognizance of the complaint under\n\nthe PMLA and not any other Special Court. Reliance has been placed\n\non the decision of the Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/132269333/\" id=\"a_393\">Directorate of\n\nEnforcement vs. Surajpal &amp; Ors.136</a> and on the other hand, the\n\n\n136   2018 SCC OnLine Del 10472 (Paras 15-16)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_178\">\f                                              92</span>\n\ndecision of the High Court of Kerala in Inspector of Police, CBI vs.\n\nAssistant Directorate, Directorate of Enforcement (PMLA) &amp;\n\nAnr.137, wherein it is observed that it is not mandatory to make an\n\napplication for committal to Special Court in every case and,\n\nsimilarly, not mandatory for the Court to allow every such\n\napplication without application of mind and dehors the merits of the\n\ncase.

Attention has been drawn to a few\n\ncases to show that these Sections prescribe gradation of punishment\n\ndepending on the nature of offence which the principal offender has\n\ncommitted138. It is stated that <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_397\">Section 3</a> of the PMLA offence also is\n\none kind of an accessory after the fact offence. It is also maintained\n\nthat in certain cases the proceeds of crime or the scheduled offence\n\nmay be committed by some person and the laundering might be done\n\n\n\n137   2019 SCC OnLine Ker 4546\n138 Sou. <a href=\"/doc/680223/\" id=\"a_398\">Vijaya Alias Baby vs. State of Maharashtra</a>, (2003) 8 SCC 296 (Para 6); Also see: <a href=\"/doc/111117/\" id=\"a_399\">State\nof Karnataka vs. Madesha &amp; Ors</a>, (2007) 7 SCC 35 and In Re Kuttayan alias Nambi Thevar, AIR\n1960 Mad 9\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_181\">\f                                 93</span>\n\nby a completely different person. In such a case, where money-\n\nlaundering is not directly connected with the scheduled offence, the\n\nlaundering is merely an accessory after the fact. He submits that\n\neven though the offence of money-laundering is a serious offence,\n\nhowever, the severest punishment is only seven years. Thus, twin\n\nconditions under <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_400\">Section 45</a> are grossly disproportionate and\n\nillogical for the crimes provided under the PMLA. It is also stated\n\nthat the equation of the bail provisions under the PMLA cannot be\n\nmade to the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_401\">NDPS Act</a> or UAPA. Further, even a serial murderer\n\nwho may be liable for capital punishment is not subjected to such\n\nstringent condition, as under <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_402\">Section 45</a> of the PMLA. Irrespective\n\nof the deleterious impact on the economy of a country, it does not\n\nshock the conscience of the society as much as the conduct of the\n\nserial murderer. Reliance is also placed upon Nikesh Tarachand\n\nShah139 in support of the argument that even if the amendment to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_403\">Section 45</a> (which was struck down in the aforementioned case)\n\nsaves the conditions from the vices on which it was struck down, the\n\nvice of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_404\">Article 21</a> persists owing to the presumption of innocence\n\n\n\n\n139   Supra at Footnote No.3\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_182\">\f                                  94</span>\n\nhaving been turned on its head.

Furthermore, it is stated that\n\npresumption of innocence is a golden thread running through all\n\ncriminal proceedings.    This can apply only in cases of extremely\n\nserious offences on the ground of compelling State interest. It is\n\nsubmitted that in such a case where the maximum sentence is of\n\nseven years, such a provision is ultra vires <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_410\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution. It is argued that in special statutes like UAPA, MCOCA\n\nand the PC Act, the reverse burden of proof has only been upheld\n\ndue to the compelling State interest, such as security and public\n\norder.

His foremost challenge is to the\n\ninterpretation of <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_412\">Section 3</a>, post addition of the Explanation vide the\n\n2019 amendment.                 He has more or less reiterated the same\n\narguments as advanced by the previous learned counsel that by way\n\nof Explanation, the ingredient of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_413\">Section 3</a> is sought\n\nto be altered by reading “and” as “or”. He has relied upon the reports\n\nand speeches of the Minister in the Parliament. Additionally, he has\n\nplaced reliance on the Vienna Convention and United Nations\n\nConvention Against Transnational Organized Crime, 2000140, which\n\nstate that money-laundering is only committed if the ‘use’ and/or\n\n‘concealment’ is ‘for the purposes of concealing or disguising the\n\nillicit origin of the property’ or ‘helping any person who has been\n\ninvolved in the commission of the predicate offence to evade the legal\n\n\n\n\n140   For short, “Palermo Convention” or “the 2000 UN Convention”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_184\">\f                                                96</span>\n\nconsequences of his/her action’141.                   Reliance is also placed on\n\nNikesh Tarachand Shah142, wherein it has been held that it is the\n\nconcealing or disguising by projecting tainted monies as untainted\n\nmoney and not their spending that is prohibited.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">(i)      Thus, exception is taken that the Explanation as added by the\n\n2019 amendment has wholly changed the scope of the main\n\nprovision which is the definition. It is contrary to the concerns of\n\nthe Select Committee and subsequent to this Explanation, a person\n\nwould now commit the offence of money-laundering the minute\n\nproceeds of crime are generated. A similarity is drawn with Section\n\n1956 of the United States Code143 where money-laundering is to\n\nconceal the illicit background of the source of the money. Further,\n\nreliance is also placed on American decisions where the Circuit\n\nCourts have held that it is not spending or using of proceeds of crime\n\nthat amounts to the offence of money-laundering, but laundering of\n\nsuch proceeds of crime144.                 Further, it has been stated that this\n\n\n\n141   See <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_414\">Article 6</a> of the Palermo Convention\n142   Supra at Footnote No.3\n143   Title 18 US Code S. 1956- Laundering of Monetary Instruments\n144 United States of America vs. Renee Armstrong Sanders, 929 F.2d 1466 (10th Cir. 1991);\nUnited States of America vs. Paul Johnson, 440 F.3d 1286, 1293 (11th Cir. 2006); United States\nof America v Roger Faulkenberry, 614 F.3d 573 (6th Cir. 2010); and Jennifer Wang, Yes, That is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_185\">\f                                           97</span>\n\nCourt in a catena of decisions, held that newly added Explanations\n\nmust be read so as to harmonise and clear of ambiguity in the main\n\nSection and cannot be construed to widen the ambit of the previous\n\nstate of the Section145.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\">(ii)    The next contention is regarding the definition of “proceeds of\n\ncrime” and use of value thereof, defined under <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_415\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> of the\n\nPMLA.      It is argued that it can be categorised into three types\n\nnamely: one - property derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by\n\nany person as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled\n\noffence; or, two - the value of such property that is property derived\n\nor obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a result of\n\ncriminal activity relating to a scheduled offence; and third - where\n\nsuch property is taken on field outside the country, then the\n\nproperty equivalent in value held within the country or abroad.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_104\">(iii) It is submitted that by reason of the Explanation(s) added in\n\n2019, it cannot be interpreted to include property not only derived\n\nor obtained from the scheduled offence but also any property which\n\n\n\nMoney Laundering.

Further, the\n\nExplanation to the term “property”, also would now include property\n\n“used in the commission of an offence”. To this, reference is made\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/1406924/\" id=\"a_418\">Articles 1</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_419\">5</a> of the Vienna Convention and <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_420\">Article 12</a> of the\n\nPalermo Convention to show that if the criminal activity does not\n\ngenerate any proceeds, then there cannot be any ‘proceeds of crime’.\n\nFurther, the ambit of property also is said to have been enlarged\n\ndisproportionately. As such, proceeds of crime need to be generated\n\nfrom the scheduled offence alone and not any criminal activity. To\n\ndemonstrate the vice, various illustrations were also pointed out to\n\nus. It is imperative that Courts can differentiate between property\n\nbeing used to commit an offence and property derived from the\n\ncommission of an offence, as is already accepted in other common\n\nlaw countries146. Thus, it is submitted that such an amendment by\n\nway of Explanation cannot expand the scope of a section.</span></span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"146045706\" id=\"span_190\">Reference\n\nis also made to the fact that attachment of property of an equivalent\n\nvalue where the actual proceeds are no longer available, is similar to\n\nother Acts, such as the UAPA, the NDPS Act, the Prohibition of\n\n\n146   R v Ahmad, [2012] 2 All ER 1137; Also see: <a href=\"/doc/146045706/\" id=\"a_421\">R v James</a>, [2012] 2 Cr App R (S) 253\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">\f                                              99</span>\n\nBenami Property Transactions Act, 1988147 and the Fugitive\n\nEconomic Offenders Act, 2018148, all having similar definition of\n\nproceeds of crime. Objection is taken to term “property equivalent\n\nin value”, where properties are attached which have been derived\n\nfrom proceeds of crime even if they are different from the original\n\nform when the proceeds were generated149.                          Further, for the\n\ninterpretation of ‘value thereof’, it is said that a broader\n\ninterpretation would be contrary to <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_422\">Sections 8(5)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_423\">8(6)</a> of the\n\nPMLA. Hence, by way of illustration, where the original proceeds of\n\ncrime are interchanged and mixed with legitimate money, it is\n\nargued that giving a broad interpretation to ‘value thereof’ would be\n\nunreasonable150.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_106\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"112310877\" id=\"span_192\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"61425710\" id=\"span_193\">(iv) In respect of <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_424\">Section 8</a>, it is argued that the true meaning of\n\nthe words “take possession” of property under <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_425\">Section 8(4)</a> should\n\nbe constructive possession instead of physical possession since it is\n\nhighly prejudicial for the accused during the pendency of the trial.\n\n\n\n147   For short, “1988 Act”\n148   For short, “2018 <a href=\"/doc/61425710/\" id=\"a_426\">Act”\n149Abdullah Ali Balsharaf &amp; Anr. vs. Directorate of Enforcement &amp; Ors.</a>, 2019 SCC Online Del\n6428; and <a href=\"/doc/112310877/\" id=\"a_427\">Seema Garg vs. Deputy Director, Directorate of Enforcement</a>, 2020 SCC Online P&amp;H\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_194\">738</span>\n150   Seema Garg (supra at Footnote No.149 above)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_195\">\f                                            100</span>\n\nReliance is placed on a decision that has been stayed by the Division\n\nBench of the Madras High Court which had originally held it to be\n\nsymbolic possession instead of actual151. It is urged that <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_428\">Article\n\n300A</a> is not only a constitutional right but also a human right.\n\nFurther, confiscation is only subject to conviction and such\n\ndisposition in all practical sense, leads to a confiscation prior to such\n\nconviction. Further, since there is no compensation in case a person\n\nis eventually acquitted, this would be a disproportionate action.

The development of international consensus\n\ntowards the offence of money-laundering has been highlighted.

The\n\nConvention mandated the participating States to conduct enhanced\n\nscrutiny of accounts sought or maintained by politically exposed\n\npersons and their associates and to implement measures to monitor\n\nthe movement of cash and other instruments across their borders\n\nso that a ‘paper trail’ be created which could assist law enforcement\n\nauthorities in investigating the transfers of illicit assets.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_124\">(vii) Thus, relying on the international Conventions, the Union of\n\nIndia has submitted that it is the international obligations of the\n\nState to not only recognize the crime of money-laundering but also\n\nto take steps for preventing the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_125\">(viii) To highlight the role played by the FATF in combating the\n\nmenace of money-laundering, the respondent has traced the origin\n\nof FATF and stated its process of reviewing the compliance with its\n\nrecommendations by every State and the consequences of non-\n\ncompliance. It is submitted that the FATF was established by the\n\nHeads of State or Government of the seven major industrial nations\n\n(Group of Seven, G-7) joined by the President of the European\n\nCommission in a summit in Paris in July, 1989 which is famous for\n\nits ‘Forty Recommendations’ to combat money-laundering and,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_233\">\f                                  113</span>\n\nhence, carry out its own evaluation and enforcement on the issue of\n\nmoney-laundering across the world.

Further, the\n\nFATF has adopted its Non-Cooperative Countries or Territories\n\n(“NCCT”) initiative in a report issued on 14.2.2020, according to\n\nwhich a 25 points criteria was recognized which is consistent with\n\nthe Forty Recommendations of the FATF and which identified\n\n‘detrimental rules and practices’ in the international effort to combat\n\nlaundering. It thus established a review process to target delinquent\n\ncountries and territories where the anti-laundering regime is\n\nineffective in practice and to take steps against those countries. The\n\nsteps which FATF may take against a non-compliant nation include\n\n‘conditioning, restricting, targeting or even prohibiting financial\n\ntransactions with non-cooperative jurisdictions’.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_126\">(ix) It is submitted that the measures against money-laundering\n\nhave evolved over the period of time.

The Second Directive (2001) widened the number of\n\ninstitutions that fell within the scope of reporting obligations and\n\nalso expanded the range of predicate offences for the purpose of\n\nmoney-laundering. EU Third Directive (2005) was directed to bring\n\nthe EU legislation into line with the revisions to the FATF\n\nRecommendations and further expanded the range of institutions\n\nwithin its scope to include life insurance intermediaries and widened\n\nthe definition of high value dealers to capture those who accept cash\n\npayments of €15,000 or more. A definition of ‘serious crimes’ was\n\nincluded that constituted ‘predicate offences’, including all offences\n\npunishable by a maximum sentence of one year or more, or a\n\nminimum sentence of six months or more (in jurisdictions where\n\nminimum sentences are applied), as well as other specified offences\n\nincluding serious fraud and corruption.

The profits\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_239\">\f                                 119</span>\n\ngained through these launderettes were thus termed ‘laundered’.\n\nFurther, the term ‘money-laundering’ was first used with a legal\n\nmeaning in an American judgment of 1982 concerning the\n\nconfiscation of laundered Columbian drug proceeds.\n\n(xix)   It is further submitted that the goal of money-laundering is\n\nto conceal the predicate offences and to ensure that the criminals\n\n‘enjoy’ their proceeds. Further, the money-laundering takes place\n\nthrough ‘a complex process often using the latest technology, of\n\nsanitizing money in such a manner that its true nature, source or\n\nuse is concealed, thereby creating an apparent justification for\n\ncontrolling or possessing the laundered money’ in a number of\n\nintermediate steps.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_137\">(xx)    It is stated that the reasons for fighting money-laundering,\n\nfirstly, is to enable law enforcement authorities to confiscate the\n\nproceeds of predicate criminal activities so as to undermine\n\norganized crime by taking away the incentive for these criminal\n\nactivities relatable to offences. Secondly, to apprehend high level\n\ncriminals as they themselves stay aloof from criminal activities but\n\ndo come into contact with the proceeds of these activities, thereby\n\ncreating a ‘paper trail’.     Thirdly, to prevent criminals from\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_240\">\f                                  120</span>\n\ndestabilizing the national economy because of its corruptive\n\ninfluence on financial markets and the reduction of the public’s\n\nconfidence in the international financial system and lastly to deter\n\nthe money launderers from impacting the growth rate of the world\n\neconomies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_138\">(xxi)   It is stated that the principal sources of illegal proceeds are\n\ncollar crimes (tax, fraud, corporate crimes, embezzlement and\n\nintellectual property crimes), drug related crimes and smuggling of\n\ngoods, evasion of excise duties, corruption and bribery (and the\n\nembezzlement of public funds).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_139\">(xxii) To show the global impact of money-laundering, it is\n\nsubmitted that the IMF and the FATF have estimated that the scale\n\nof money-laundering transactions is between 2% and 5% of the\n\nglobal GDP. It is also stated that the United Nations has recently\n\nput the figure of money-laundering at USD 2.1 trillion or 3.6% of\n\nglobal GDP.       Thus, the operation of money-laundering has\n\ninternational dimension. It is submitted that measures being taken\n\nat the national level would be inadequate, which made it necessary\n\nto establish effective international co-operation mechanisms to allow\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_241\">\f                                   121</span>\n\nnational authorities to co-operate in the prevention and prosecution\n\nof money-laundering and in international ‘proceeds-hunting’.\n\n(xxiii) Further, it is submitted that the measures to combat money-\n\nlaundering have evolved from post facto criminalization to preventive\n\napproach with its stress on the reporting obligations. The definition\n\nof “money-laundering” is now no more restricted to the elements of\n\nprojection and untainted property.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_140\">(xxiv)   It is stated that India, and its version of the PMLA, is ‘merely\n\na cog in this international vehicle’ and as India is a signatory to these\n\ntreaties, therefore, is bound legally and morally, to adopt the best\n\nglobal practices and respond to the changing needs of the times. It\n\nis, therefore, submitted that the constitutionality of the PMLA has to\n\nbe adjudicated from the stand point of the country’s obligations and\n\nevolving responsibilities internationally.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_141\">(xxv) The learned Solicitor General invited our attention to the\n\nintroduction to the PMLA. Making reference to the Statement of\n\nObjects and Reasons of the Act, he submits that the Act was enacted\n\nwith the intent of establishing a strict and stringent framework to\n\naddress the global menace of money-laundering.             Refuting the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_242\">\f                                 122</span>\n\nprivate parties’ attempt to classify the Act as being a purely penal\n\nstatute, he submits that the PMLA is an amorphous or hybrid\n\nstatute, which has regulatory, preventive and penal aspects.\n\nLearned Solicitor General then walked us through the various\n\nprovisions of the PMLA, and submitted that categorizing the Act as\n\nbeing merely penal in nature, would not only defeat the purpose of\n\nthe Act, but would also be against the express provisions enshrined\n\ntherein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_142\">(xxvi) It is further submitted by the Union of India that the PMLA is\n\na complete Code in itself, and establishes a specific separate\n\nprocedure to the extent necessary and to be followed in proceedings\n\nunder the Act.    Laying down a brief summary of the legislative\n\nscheme of the Act, the respondent submits that there has been a\n\nconscious legislative departure from conventional penal law in India.\n\nConsidering the peculiar nature of money-laundering – which\n\nrequires prevention, regulation and prosecution, a completely\n\ndifferent scheme is framed by the Legislature.     The new scheme\n\nintroduced for dealing with the money-laundering is as a part of\n\nIndia’s global responsibility in international law. While complying\n\nwith the mandate of FATF, the Legislature has very consciously\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_243\">\f                                   123</span>\n\nensured that the Act becomes compliant with the Constitution of\n\nIndia. Referring to the rules formulated under the PMLA, it is also\n\nsubmitted that the scheme of the Act and rules framed thereunder\n\nprescribe an elaborate procedure to ensure complete confidentiality,\n\nand place sufficient inbuilt checks and balances to prevent potential\n\nabuse.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_143\">(xxvii)    The respondent then sheds some light on the offences\n\nbeing investigated by the Directorate of Enforcement. It is submitted\n\nthat the number of cases taken up for investigation each year has\n\nrisen from 111 cases in 2015-16 to 981 in 2020-21. Comparing the\n\nnumber of cases registered annually under money-laundering\n\nlegislations, it is submitted that the low registration of cases in India\n\nis due to the robust mechanism for risk-based selection of cases for\n\ninvestigation. The ED is focusing its attention on cases involving\n\nhigh value of proceeds of crime and cases involving serious predicate\n\noffence involving terror financing, narcotics, corruption, offence\n\ninvolving national security, etc. To that effect, it is highlighted that\n\nattachment proceedings concerning some of the fugitives, who are\n\nfacing action, were done and assets worth Rs.19,111.20 crores out\n\nof a total fraud of Rs.22,585.83 crores were attached. Furthermore,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_244\">\f                                  124</span>\n\nthe investigation in 57 cases of terror and Naxal financing has\n\nresulted in identification of proceeds of crime worth over Rs.1,249\n\ncrores and attachment of proceeds of crime of Rs.982 crores (256\n\nproperties) and filing of 37 prosecution complaints and conviction of\n\ntwo terrorists under PMLA. Lastly, it is stated that the quantum of\n\nproceeds of crime involved in the bunch cases under the PMLA which\n\nare under consideration in these matters is Rs.67,104 crores.\n\n(xxviii)   Having laid down the basic scheme of the PMLA, learned\n\nSolicitor General proceeded to discuss the definition of “money-\n\nlaundering” as per <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_496\">Section 3</a> of the Act.      Tracing its origin, it is\n\nsubmitted that the term “money-laundering” finds its initial\n\ndefinition in <a href=\"/doc/1203297/\" id=\"a_497\">Article 3.1(b)(i)(ii)</a> and (c)(i) of the Vienna Convention.\n\nHowever, the Vienna Convention limited the predicate offences to\n\ndrug trafficking offences, and, consequently, led to the adoption of\n\nan expansive definition covering the widest range of predicate\n\noffences under the Palermo Convention.            Building upon the\n\ndefinitions contained in the Vienna Convention and the Palermo\n\nConvention, the FATF recommended member countries to expand\n\nthe predicate offences to include serious crimes.       The same was\n\nmade binding on the member countries by way of Recommendation\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_245\">\f                                                125</span>\n\nNo. 1 and Recommendation No. 3 of the FATF. Subsequent to its\n\nenactment, the PMLA became subject to evaluation by the FATF\n\nbased on the Forty Recommendations formulated by the FATF. In\n\n2010, the FATF adopted the ‘Mutual Evaluation of the Anti-Money\n\nLaundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of Terrorism (CFT)\n\nRegime of India Report’183. As per Recommendation No. 1 of the\n\nMutual Evaluation Report, the concealment, possession, disposition\n\nand use of proceeds of crime were not criminalized by PMLA, and\n\nIndia was, thus, held to be not fully compliant. Thus, with a view to\n\naddress the legal deficiency as pointed out by FATF and to make it\n\nglobally          compliant,       the        <a href=\"/doc/109078369/\" id=\"a_498\">Prevention   of   Money-Laundering\n\n(Amendment) Act, 2012</a> amended <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_499\">Section 3</a> to include these\n\nactivities.        In support of his argument, learned Solicitor General\n\ndraws our attention to the Statement of Object and Reasons of\n\nPrevention of Money Laundering (Amendment) Bill, 2011184, and the\n\nparliamentary debates surrounding the amendment.\n\n(xxix)        Summing up the recommendations of the FATF, it is clarified\n\nby the learned Solicitor General that even in an act of mere\n\n\n183   For short, “Mutual Evaluation Report”\n184   For short, “2011 Bill”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_246\">\f                                   126</span>\n\nconcealment, mere possession or mere use of “proceeds of crime” or\n\n“activity” connected with the proceeds of crime, per se, is an offence.\n\nIn other words, if a person conceals the proceeds of crime, keeps it\n\nin his possession or uses it, he is guilty of money-laundering\n\nirrespective of as to whether he is projecting it as untainted or not.\n\nThis is for the simple reason that if a person conceals something\n\n(proceeds of crime), it is an act committed knowingly and, thus, the\n\nquestion of that person projecting that very thing either as tainted\n\nor untainted does not arise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\">(xxx) It is further explained that the anomaly resulting from an\n\nerroneous drafting was successfully explained during the 2013\n\nreview of FATF by categorically contending that all expressions\n\nfollowing   the   term    “including”    are   mere   illustrative   and\n\nindependently constitute an offence of money-laundering without\n\nbeing dependent upon each other.          Thus, so long as a person\n\nknowingly becomes a party or is actually involved in any process or\n\nactivity connected with proceeds of crime, such a person is guilty of\n\nmoney-laundering.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_145\">(xxxi)   In order to lend further credibility to the sanctity of the FATF\n\nMutual Evaluation Report and the recommendations contained\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_247\">\f                                      127</span>\n\ntherein, the learned Solicitor General took us through the numerous\n\namendments incorporated in the PMLA by way of the 2012\n\nAmendment Act which was largely based on the recommendation of\n\nthe FATF. Special emphasis is laid on the amendments carried out\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_500\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_501\">8</a> of the Act pursuant to FATF recommendations.\n\nIt is further submitted that apart from the PMLA, corresponding\n\namendments to the UAPA, the NDPS Act and the Companies Act\n\nhave been also made as a sequel to the FATF recommendation\n\nduring the Mutual Evaluation of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_146\">(xxxii)       Learned Solicitor General submitted that the interpretation\n\nput forth by the other side, would effectively result in granting the\n\naccused a license to commit the offence of money-laundering and\n\nthereafter either conceal the proceeds of crime, or keep them in his\n\npossession, or use them and thereby wriggle out of the legislative\n\nintent of preventing money-laundering by raising a plea that the\n\nsame were never claimed/projected as being untainted property.\n\nReliance is placed on Seaford Court Estates Ld. vs. Asher185, to\n\npoint out that principles of statutory interpretation dictate that any\n\n\n\n\n185[1949]   2 K.B. 481.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_248\">\f                                           128</span><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_147\">\n\ninterpretation which leads to mischief should be avoided and the\n\nstatute should be so construed that the legislative intent is not\n\ndefeated. It is submitted that the limitations of traditional approach\n\nto crime and in fact, highlights the importance of the evolved\n\napproach of anti-money laundering laws in the nature of the PMLA.\n\nThus, the definition of “money-laundering” as it exists, passes the\n\nmuster, both under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_502\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_503\">21</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n(xxxiii)         It is further submitted that the Explanation to <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_504\">Section 3</a>\n\ninserted vide <a href=\"/doc/105739094/\" id=\"a_505\">Finance (No.2) Act, 2019</a>, is merely clarificatory in\n\nnature and elucidates the legislative intent behind the provision.\n\nReliance         is    placed   on   the   background/justification   of   the\n\namendments to PMLA as contained in the debate on the Finance Bill,\n\n2019186.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_148\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"686582\" id=\"span_249\">(xxxiv)          Strong emphasis is laid on the use of the word ‘any’ in the\n\nphrase ‘any process or activity’. A careful reading of <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_506\">Section 3</a> of the\n\nPMLA clearly provides that any process or activity which itself has a\n\nwider meaning also includes the process or activity of concealment,\n\npossession, acquisition, use and/ or projecting, claiming it as\n\n\n\n186   For short, “2019 Bill”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_250\">\f                                             129</span>\n\nuntainted property.

It is, therefore,\n\nsubmitted that the correct interpretation of the word “and” should\n\nbe “or” as it was always intended by the legislature. Further, it is\n\nstated that any interpretation contrary to this will render the\n\nprovision meaningless. To bolster this argument, reliance is placed\n\non the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/51738625/\" id=\"a_523\">Sanjay Dutt vs. State</a> through\n\nC.B.I., Bombay (II)193. In that case the Court held that the word\n\n‘and’ should be interpreted as ‘or’ and the words “arms and\n\nammunition” should not be read conjunctively; otherwise, the object\n\nof the Act will be defeated.

It is submitted that firstly, the power of arrest under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_592\">Section 19</a> can be exercised only by a Director, Deputy Director,\n\nAssistant Director or any other police officer authorized in this behalf\n\nby the Central Government as opposed to <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_593\">Cr.P.C</a>., where the power\n\nof arrest can be exercised by any police officer without a warrant\n\neven on the basis of reasonable suspicion, as per <a href=\"/doc/1899251/\" id=\"a_594\">Section 41</a> of the\n\nCr.P.C.        The Director, who is the head of ED, is appointed by a\n\nneutral process mentioned under Section 25 of Central Vigilance\n\nCommission Act, 2003243. Therefore, only persons of particular rank\n\nwho are appointed by statute have the power to arrest any person\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_595\">Section 19</a> of the PMLA. Secondly, there must be material in\n\n\n\n\n240   (2015) 1 SCC 1 (also at Footnote No.127)\n241   (2018) 17 SCC 394\n242   2021 SCC OnLine SC 1173\n243   For short, “CVC Act”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_315\">\f                                  144</span>\n\npossession with the Authority before the power of arrest can be\n\nexercised as opposed to <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_596\">Cr.P.C</a> which gives the power of arrest to\n\nany police officer and the officer can arrest any person merely on the\n\nbasis of a complaint, credible information or reasonable suspicion\n\nagainst such person. Thirdly, there should be reason to believe that\n\nthe person being arrested is guilty of the offence punishable under\n\nPMLA in contrast to the provision in <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_597\">Cr.P.C</a>., which mainly requires\n\nreasonable apprehension/suspicion of commission of offence. Also,\n\nsuch reasons to believe must be reduced in writing. Fifthly, as per\n\nthe constitutional mandate of <a href=\"/doc/1293832/\" id=\"a_598\">Article 22(1)</a>, the person arrested is\n\nrequired to be informed of the grounds of his arrest. It is submitted\n\nthat the argument of the other side that the accused or arrested\n\npersons are not even informed of the case against them, is contrary\n\nto the plain language of the Act, as the Act itself mandates that the\n\nperson arrested is to be informed of the ground of his arrest. Sixthly,\n\nthe Authority arresting the person is required to forward a copy of\n\nthe order of arrest and material in its possession to the Adjudicatory\n\nAuthority in a sealed envelope, which is required to be retained for\n\na period of ten (10) years as per the Prevention of Money Laundering\n\n[the Forms and Manner of Forwarding a Copy of Order of Arrest of a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_316\">\f                                    145</span>\n\nPerson along with the Material to the Adjudicating Authority and its\n\nPeriod of Retention] Rules, 2005. Seventhly, it is stated that the\n\nperson arrested is required to be produced before the Special Court\n\nor the Magistrate within twenty-four hours of his arrest. Thus, the\n\ncompetent Court can look at the material in possession of the\n\nDirector and the reasons formed by him to believe that the person is\n\nguilty of the offence under the PMLA, so as to satisfy itself of the\n\nlegality of his arrest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_165\">(liv) It is submitted that as there is nothing contrary in the PMLA\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_599\">Section 167</a> of Cr.P.C., therefore, the provisions of remand under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1687975/\" id=\"a_600\">Section 167</a> Cr.P.C. would also apply and any further detention of\n\nthe arrested person would only be allowed by the competent Court\n\nand, for the same reasons, Chapter V of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_601\">Cr.P.C</a>. would also apply\n\nin case of arrest made under the PMLA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_166\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"2982624\" id=\"span_317\">(lv)      Further, it is submitted that the guidelines issued in <a href=\"/doc/2982624/\" id=\"a_602\">Arnesh\n\nKumar vs. State of Bihar &amp; Anr.244</a> will have no application for\n\nthe purpose of arrest under PMLA.          The guidelines in <a href=\"/doc/2982624/\" id=\"a_603\">the said\n\ndecision</a> were issued to avoid misuse of the provision of arrest, while\n\n\n\n244   (2014) 8 SCC 273\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_318\">\f                                   146</span>\n\nin the case of the PMLA, there is already a higher threshold specified\n\nfor arresting any person.       Therefore, there is no possibility of\n\narbitrary arrest under the PMLA. Whereas, since the decision to\n\narrest is taken by high official after complying with threshold\n\nrequirements in law, there will be presumption that he has acted\n\nbona fide.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_167\">(lvi) It is stated that considering the nature and gravity of the\n\noffence, the serving of notice to a person as prescribed under <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_604\">Section\n\n41A</a> of Cr.P.C. would materially interfere with fair investigation being\n\ndone by high official bestowed with such responsibility and make the\n\ninvestigation redundant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_168\">(lvii)    Further, it is submitted that the contention of the private\n\nparties that the power under <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_605\">Section 19</a> of PMLA can only be invoked\n\nafter a complaint is filed, is devoid of any merits. It is submitted that\n\nin a complaint case under the PMLA, a complaint is similar to the\n\npolice report filed under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_606\">Section 173</a> of the Cr.P.C, which makes the\n\narrest a part of investigation which would always be prior to filing of\n\nthe      complaint   under   <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_607\">Section     44</a>   or   further   complaint   as\n\ncontemplated in Explanation in <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_608\">Section 44</a>. Further, the proviso to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_609\">Section 44(1)(b)</a> which provides for filing of a closure report before\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_319\">\f                                   147</span>\n\nthe Special Court, if after investigation no offence of money-\n\nlaundering is made out, makes it absolutely clear that the complaint\n\nis to be filed after the conclusion of investigation.\n\n(lviii) It is submitted that <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_610\">Section 19</a> of PMLA is pari materia to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/852142/\" id=\"a_611\">Section 35</a> of the FERA and Section 103 of the 1962 Act and their\n\nvalidity has been upheld by this Court.         Reliance is placed on\n\nRomesh Chandra Mehta245 to urge that the filing of complaint,\n\nafter the investigation, is not a necessary prerequisite before\n\narresting the person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_169\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1730508\" id=\"span_320\">(lix) Reliance is then placed on the decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1730508/\" id=\"a_612\">Union\n\nof India vs. Padam Narain Aggarwal &amp; Ors.246</a>, wherein the\n\nCourt examined the power to arrest under Section 104 of 1962 Act.\n\nRelying on the decision, it was stated that the power to arrest is\n\nstatutory in character and cannot be interfered with and can only be\n\nexercised on objective considerations free from whims, caprice or\n\nfancy of the officer. The law takes due care to ensure individual\n\nfreedom and liberty by laying down norms and providing safeguards\n\n\n\n\n245   Supra at Footnote No.119\n246   (2008) 13 SCC 305\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_321\">\f                                 148</span>\n\nso that the authorities may not misuse such power. It is submitted\n\nthat the requirement of “reason to believe” and “recording of such\n\nreasons in writing” prevent arbitrariness and makes the provision\n\ncompliant with <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_613\">Article 14.</a> This is reinforced from the fact that only\n\n313 arrests have been made under the PMLA in 17 years of\n\noperations of the PMLA.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_170\">(lx) Canadian judgment in Gifford vs. Kelson247 was also relied\n\non to state that “reason to believe” conveys conviction of the mind\n\nfounded on evidence regarding the existence of a fact or the doing of\n\nan act, therefore, is of a higher standard than mere suspicion.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1805578\" id=\"span_322\">Reliance has been further placed on <a href=\"/doc/1805578/\" id=\"a_614\">Premium Granites &amp; Anr. vs.\n\nState of T.N. &amp; Ors.248</a> to urge that the requirement of giving\n\nreasons for exercise of the power by itself excludes chances of\n\narbitrariness.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1887494\" id=\"span_323\">The learned Solicitor General has further relied on\n\nthe decision in M/s. <a href=\"/doc/1887494/\" id=\"a_615\">Sukhwinder Pal Bipan Kumar &amp; Ors. vs.\n\nState of Punjab &amp; Ors.249</a> to state that there is a presumption that\n\nthe discretion will not be abused where the discretion is vested with\n\n\n\n247   (1943) 51 Man.

The\n\nLegislature has several statutory mechanisms to bring about\n\ndeterrence effect so as to prevent the commission of an offence and\n\nthe quantum of punishment is only one such mechanism.              It is\n\nfurther submitted that a stringent condition of bail is relatable to the\n\nobject of creating a deterrent effect on persons who may commit the\n\noffence of money-laundering which is also manifest in the Preamble\n\nof the Act. To give effect to the international standards of preventing\n\nmoney-laundering prescribed by FATF and other international\n\ntreaties, stringent bail conditions are necessary and the Legislature\n\nhas provided enough safeguards under <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_618\">Section 19</a> so as to balance\n\n\n250   (2005) 3 SCC 647\n251   (2015) 2 SCC 33\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_327\">\f                                     150</span>\n\nthe rights of the accused and to protect the interest of the\n\ninvestigation as well. It is urged that the legislative policy of the\n\ncountry has consistently treated money-laundering as a serious\n\noffence affecting the microeconomic strength of the country.\n\nFurther, it is stated that the twin conditions under <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_619\">Section 45</a> of the\n\nPMLA are reasonable from the stand point of the accused and his\n\nrights under <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_620\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution, which provides an\n\nobjective criteria and intelligible differentia, hence, does not violate\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_621\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Further it is submitted that there are\n\nonly some issues on which the international community is building\n\nconsensus and money-laundering is one of them, others being\n\nterrorism, drug related offences and organized crime and the twin\n\nconditions are provided in all three categories of laws by the\n\nLegislature.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_172\">(lxii) Relying on international Conventions, such as Vienna\n\nConvention, Palermo Convention and FATF Recommendations, it is\n\nurged that the same concern has been expressed by the global\n\ncommunity,      which   is    reflected    in   all   the   above-mentioned\n\nConventions. It is further submitted that <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_622\">Section 45</a> of the PMLA\n\nfulfils   the   mandate      of   international       Conventions   as   the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_328\">\f                                     151</span>\n\nimplementation of the PMLA is monitored internationally and is\n\nlinked to India&#x27;s international obligations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_173\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"50294192\" id=\"span_329\">(lxiii)      It is submitted that in furtherance of the legitimate State\n\ninterest, departure from ordinary criminal procedure has been made\n\nunder the PMLA. Reliance has been placed on <a href=\"/doc/50294192/\" id=\"a_623\">A.K. Roy vs. Union\n\nof India &amp; Ors.252</a> to urge that that ‘the liberty of the individual has\n\nto be subordinated, within reasonable bounds, to the good of the\n\npeople’. Further, the twin conditions are not novel or draconian in\n\nnature as they are also present in other numerous special\n\nenactments for the welfare of the people and they not only provide\n\ndeterrent effect but also tackle the offence of money-laundering. It\n\nis submitted that this Court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah253 has not\n\nreckoned this crucial aspect.        It is submitted that the length of\n\npunishment is not the only indicator of the gravity of the offence and\n\nprivate parties have wrongly argued that the twin conditions cannot\n\nbe made applicable in a legislation which carry a punishment of only\n\nseven (7) years.

An accused can\n\nanonymously remove the money trail using the technology, which is\n\navailable today so as to make the investigation infructuous.\n\nTherefore, even deposit of the passport of the accused may not deter\n\n\n\n\n260   (1958) SCR 1226\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_339\">\f                                  154</span>\n\nthe accused from fleeing the course of justice or to eliminate the\n\nevidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_176\">(lxvi) It is submitted that economic offences constitute a class apart\n\nand need to be visited with different approach in the matter of bail.\n\nFurther, the fact that the economic offences are considered as a\n\ndifferent class of offences, recognizes the grave and serious nature\n\nof the offence with deep rooted conspiracy, as they involve huge loss\n\nof public funds, thus, affecting the economy of the country as a\n\nwhole. It is submitted that the Court while granting bail must keep\n\nin mind the nature of accusations, the nature of evidence in support\n\nthereof, the severity of the punishment which conviction will entail,\n\nthe character of the accused, circumstances which are peculiar to\n\nthe accused, reasonable possibility of securing the presence of the\n\naccused, reasonable apprehension of the witnesses being tampered\n\nwith and the larger interests of the public/State. It is submitted that\n\ngranting or refusal to grant bail depends on the nature of offence,\n\nneeds of investigation, status of the accused and other factors. The\n\nLegislature, being aware of the need of the day, is competent to\n\nprovide a special procedure for grant of bail. It would be wrong to\n\nsay that the Court has unfettered discretion in granting or refusal to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_340\">\f                                              155</span>\n\ngrant the bail. It is true that the Court exercises discretion while\n\ngranting or refusing bail, but that exercise of power has to be within\n\nthe legislative framework. It is stated that the requirement of the\n\nCourt being satisfied that the “accused is not guilty of an offence” is\n\nnot a novel legislative device. <a href=\"/doc/848468/\" id=\"a_631\">Section 437</a> of Cr.P.C. also imposes a\n\nsimilar condition261.            Moreover, the twin conditions have been\n\nprovided for by the Parliament in numerous other enactments as\n\nwell. It is submitted that the Parliament is competent to classify\n\noffences and offenders in different categories. The Parliament has\n\nclassified the offence of money-laundering as a separate class of\n\noffence from ordinary criminal laws. The said classification was\n\nnecessary because the PMLA was framed in a specific international\n\ncontext, providing for separate and special architecture for\n\ninvestigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">\n\n\n261437.

The PMLA is a\n\ncomplete Code in itself, which creates a separate machinery to tackle\n\nthe social menace, having adequate safeguards. It is submitted that\n\nLegislature has on numerous occasions made departures from the\n\nordinary penal and procedural laws as and when the situation\n\narrived. The classification of the offence on the basis of public policy\n\nand underlying purpose of the Act cannot be said to be unreasonable\n\nor arbitrary. Therefore, the Parliament is fully competent to deal\n\nwith special type of cases by providing a distinct and different\n\nprocedure which in the circumstances, cannot be said to be\n\nunreasonable. Therefore, it is submitted that a different standard\n\nfor bail can be provided in an offence which serves a special purpose.\n\nTo buttress these submissions, reliance has been placed on Kathi\n\nRaning Rawat vs. State of Saurashtra262, Kedar Nath Bajoria\n\n\n\n\n262   AIR 1952 SC 123\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_342\">\f                                  157</span>\n\n&amp; Anr. vs. The State of West Bengal263, Special Reference No.1\n\nof 1978264 and Kartar Singh265.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_180\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"334293\" id=\"span_343\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"4354\" id=\"span_344\">(lxviii) Further reliance has been placed on Asbury Hospital vs.\n\nCass County266, <a href=\"/doc/4354/\" id=\"a_633\">Chiranjit Lal Chowdhuri vs. The Union of India\n\n&amp; Ors.267</a> and <a href=\"/doc/334293/\" id=\"a_634\">The State of Bombay &amp; Anr. vs. F.N.

It is submitted that the reasons due\n\nto which the Court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah296 held the twin\n\nconditions         to     be    unconstitutional,   are   firstly   because   the\n\nunamended provision had a classification which was based on\n\nsentencing of the scheduled offence, and secondly, because the\n\napplicability of the twin conditions was restricted only to a particular\n\nclass of offences within the PMLA i.e., offences punishable for a term\n\nof imprisonment of more than three (3) years under Part A of the\n\nSchedule and not to all the offences under the PMLA.

However,\n\nthere is no such anomaly present in the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_832\">PMLA Act</a> because the\n\ninvestigating authority can file a closure report under the proviso to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_833\">Section 44(1)(b)</a> of the PMLA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_210\">(xviii)       It is further submitted that in Tofan Singh375, it was held\n\nthat if the statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_834\">Section 67</a> of the NDPS Act is\n\nheld to be admissible in all situations, then it will render <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_835\">Section 53A</a>\n\nof the NDPS Act otiose, whereas the PMLA does not contain any\n\nprovision similar to <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_836\">Section 53A</a> of the NDPS Act.\n\n(xix)       Further, in the case of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_837\">NDPS Act</a>, prevention, detection\n\nand punishment of crime was not held to be ancillary function of the\n\nAct.

Moreover, in case of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_840\">NDPS Act</a>, the\n\ninvestigating authority is required to file a chargesheet. However, in\n\ncase of the PMLA, cognizance is taken on a complaint.\n\n(xxi) Lastly, it is contended that <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_841\">Section 50</a> of the PMLA is almost\n\nidentical to Section 108 of the 1962 Act. Therefore, the statements\n\nmade under <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_842\">Section 50</a> are evidence as opposed to <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_843\">Section 67</a> of the\n\nNDPS Act. Hence, <a href=\"/doc/1581072/\" id=\"a_844\">Section 50(2)</a> of the PMLA cannot be read down\n\nas done in Tofan Singh376, in case of <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_845\">Section 67</a> of the NDPS Act.\n\n(xxii) The respondent has demonstrated the legislative history of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_846\">Section 24</a> of the PMLA and cited Recommendation 3 of the FATF\n\n(2003)/ Recommendation 4 of FATF (2012) to state that the FATF\n\nhad stipulated that the burden of proving the lawful origin of the\n\nproperty shall be on the accused.                        In view of the FATF\n\nrecommendations and the recommendations of the Standing\n\nCommittee of Finance (2011-12), comprehensive amendments were\n\n\n\n376   Supra at Footnote No.31 (also at Footnote No.24)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_459\">\f                                 191</span>\n\nmade to the provisions of the PMLA.        It is submitted that the\n\nStanding Committee of Finance recommended that there should be\n\nadequate safeguards for persons not charged with the offence of\n\nmoney-laundering; therefore <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_847\">Section 24</a> was amended in its present\n\nform. It is submitted that the concerns of the Standing Committee\n\nhave been incorporated under the provision by using the word “may”\n\nin case of any other person and the word “shall” in case of a person\n\ncharged with the offence of money-laundering under <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_848\">Section 24</a> of\n\nthe PMLA. Therefore, it would be wrong to say that the provision is\n\nnot constitutionally valid, as the provision itself contains safeguard\n\nfor the person not charged with the offence of money-laundering.\n\n(xxiii) It is submitted that in criminal trials the standard of proof\n\nis beyond reasonable doubt.      However, such rule of evidence is\n\nneither found in Section 101 nor in <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_849\">Section 3</a> of the 1872 Act, which\n\ndefines the word “proved”. Therefore, it cannot be said that this\n\nprinciple is a principle of universal application and, therefore,\n\nLegislature in appropriate classes of legislations would be competent\n\nto take departure from this principle. It is submitted that when\n\nLegislature enacts a provision which states that the burden of proof\n\nis shifted to the accused then what is actually done is that standard\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_460\">\f                                               192</span>\n\nof proof beyond reasonable doubt is lowered. It is submitted that\n\nProfessor Glanville Williams in his book - The Proof of Guilt has also\n\ncriticized the doctrine of proving the guilt of the accused beyond\n\nreasonable doubt. It is stated that this principle generally entails\n\nthe acquittal of the guilty person which frustrate the investigation of\n\nthe police, as a result of which they may resort to improper methods\n\nof obtaining convictions, also the law and order gets into the turmoil.\n\n(xxiv) Respondent admits that the principle of innocence is a\n\nhuman right and forms the basis of criminal jurisprudence377.</span>\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"441929\" id=\"span_461\">Reliance has been placed on <a href=\"/doc/441929/\" id=\"a_850\">Hiten P.

Further reliance has been placed on the 47th\n\nReport of the Law Commission, 1972, which observed that special\n\nefforts are necessary to eliminate the effect of socio-economic\n\noffences and stringent provisions are essential to safeguard the\n\nnational wealth and welfare. It is submitted that the PMLA seeks to\n\nachieve the goal of deterrence and also confiscation of proceeds of\n\ncrime and, therefore, the provision is in line with the 47th Law\n\nCommission report. It is pointed out that even the general statutes\n\nsuch as the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_855\">IPC</a> and the 1872 Act also provide for the reverse burden\n\nof proof383.

It is submitted that possession of proceeds of crime\n\nbeing key to the offence of money, all activities having an element of\n\npossession after 01.07.2005 shall fall within the ambit of the Act\n\nirrespective of the date on which the scheduled offence was\n\ncommitted. For, the offence of money-laundering is a continuing\n\noffence, the cause of action for which renews with every day of\n\npossession. Thus, it is submitted that the argument of the private\n\nparties claiming protection of <a href=\"/doc/1501707/\" id=\"a_919\">Article 20(1)</a> is devoid of merit.\n\n(xxxvii)         At the outset, it is submitted that an ECIR under the\n\nPMLA is not required be registered like an FIR under <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_920\">Section 154</a>,\n\nCr.P.C. It is further submitted that as per the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_921\">Cr.P.C</a>.,\n\na police officer is mandatorily required to register an FIR under\n\nSection 154 upon receipt of information regarding commission of a\n\ncognizable offence. However, the PMLA contains no such provision\n\nregarding receipt of information or registration406. To lend support\n\nto his arguments, the learned Additional Solicitor General points out\n\ncertain differences between investigation under the <a href=\"/doc/10239019/\" id=\"a_922\"><a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_923\">Cr.P.C</a>. and the\n\n\n\n\n406   Lalita Kumari</a> (supra at Footnote Nos.13 and 206)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_499\">\f                                               207</span>\n\nPMLA.       Firstly, the nature of “investigation”, as envisaged under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1067480/\" id=\"a_924\">Section 2(h)</a><a href=\"/doc/834094/\" id=\"a_925\">407</a> of the Cr.P.C. is different from that under the PMLA,\n\nas defined under <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_926\">Section 2(1)(na)</a>408 of the PMLA, insofar as the\n\ninvestigation under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_927\">Cr.P.C</a>. is a proceeding for collection of\n\nevidence.        Therefore, any proceeding that does not amount to\n\ncollection of evidence, cannot amount to investigation, and only\n\nupon the registration of the FIR, can the police officer start\n\ninvestigation. Secondly, it is submitted that an investigation under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_928\">Cr.P.C</a>. is ordinarily required to be conducted by a police officer,\n\nor any person so authorized by a Magistrate. In contrast, <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_929\">Section\n\n45(1A)</a>409 of the PMLA explicitly bars investigation by a police officer,\n\n\n\n4072.

Thirdly, investigation under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_932\">Cr.P.C</a>.\n\nnecessarily needs to be for purpose of collecting evidence in relation\n\nto cognizable offences for which an FIR under Section 154 has been\n\nregistered410.       On the contrary, investigation i.e., collection of\n\nevidence under the PMLA need not necessarily be in relation to the\n\ncognizable offence of money-laundering, but it can also be for the\n\npurposes of attachment, confiscation, formulation of reasons to\n\nconduct search or seizure under <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_933\">Section 17</a>, or personal search\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_934\">Section 18</a>, etc. This further implies that unlike the procedure\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_935\">Cr.P.C</a>., where the registration of an FIR is a condition\n\nprecedent to initiation of investigation411, in such cases, the\n\ninvestigation can commence even prior to the receipt of information\n\npertaining to commission of money-laundering. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1926500\" id=\"span_501\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"53510844\" id=\"span_502\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"767596\" id=\"span_503\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1361495\" id=\"span_504\">In this regard, the\n\nlearned Additional Solicitor General draws our attention to <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_936\">Section\n\n17(1)(iv)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/192126/\" id=\"a_937\">Section 5(1)</a> of the PMLA which empower the Director\n\nto collect evidence by way of search and seizure, and attachment of\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1361495/\" id=\"a_938\">410H.N.

According\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/72194817/\" id=\"a_943\">Section 65</a> of the PMLA, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_944\">Cr.P.C</a>. shall apply\n\nto       arrest,      search          and   seizure,   attachment,   confiscation,\n\ninvestigation, prosecution and all other proceedings under the Act,\n\nso long as the same are not inconsistent with the provisions of the\n\nAct. It is the case of the respondents that registration of an FIR does\n\nnot amount to collection of evidence, and, thus, is outside the\n\npurview of “investigation”, as defined under <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_945\">Section 2(1)(na)</a> of the\n\nPMLA. Consequently, it is submitted that since the registration of\n\nan FIR does not fall into any of seven categories contemplated under\n\n\n\n\n412   <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_946\">Section 17(1)(iv)</a> of the PMLA\n413   <a href=\"/doc/192126/\" id=\"a_947\">Section 5(1)(a)</a> of the PMLA\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_506\">\f                                               210</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/72194817/\" id=\"a_948\">Section 65</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1980578/\" id=\"a_949\">Section 154</a> of the Cr.P.C. will not apply to proceedings\n\nunder the PMLA.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_238\">(xxxix)          As regards the provision of a copy of the ECIR to the\n\naccused, it is submitted that unlike an FIR which is a statutory\n\nmandate, an ECIR is an internal document and, thus, need not be\n\nsupplied to the accused. In response to the argument of the private\n\nparties that the failure to supply a copy of the ECIR prejudices the\n\nrights of an accused, it is stated that revealing a copy of the ECIR\n\nwould defeat the purpose of the Act and would frustrate recovery\n\nprovisions like attachment of property.                       The learned Additional\n\nSolicitor General also refutes the submission of the private parties\n\nthat a copy of the ECIR would be useful for grant of anticipatory bail.\n\nIt is submitted that in cases of offences under the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_950\">IPC</a>, anticipatory\n\nbail can be applied for even prior to the registration of an FIR414.\n\nMoreover, it is often the case that the FIR is registered against\n\nunknown persons, and the FIR, therefore, cannot be said to be an\n\nencyclopaedia of all the facts415.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_239\">\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1038846\" id=\"span_507\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"123660783\" id=\"span_508\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1013766\" id=\"span_509\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1308768\" id=\"span_510\"><a href=\"/doc/1308768/\" id=\"a_951\">414Shri Gurbaksh Singh Sibbia &amp; Ors. vs. State of Punjab</a>, (1980) 2 SCC 565; <a href=\"/doc/1013766/\" id=\"a_952\">Deepak Mahajan</a>\n(supra at Footnote No.60); and <a href=\"/doc/123660783/\" id=\"a_953\">Sushila Aggarwal</a> (supra <a href=\"/doc/1038846/\" id=\"a_954\">at Footnote No.318)\n415   Superintendent of Police, CBI &amp; Ors. vs. Tapan Kumar Singh</a>, (2003) 6 SCC 175\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_511\">\f                                 211</span>\n\n(xl) Next, learned Additional Solicitor General made submissions\n\non the challenge to constitutionality of <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_955\">Sections 17</a> and <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_956\">18</a> of the\n\nPMLA (i.e., the provisions relating to the power of search and\n\nseizure).

It is submitted that the vesting of the\n\npower to authorise a search and seizure under <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_959\">Section 17</a> with the\n\nhighest responsible authority prevents misuse of the provision.</span></span></span></span>\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"558753\" id=\"span_512\">Reliance is placed on <a href=\"/doc/558753/\" id=\"a_960\">Pooran Mal vs. The Director of Inspection\n\n(Investigation), New Delhi &amp; Ors.416</a>, to that effect.

It is\n\nsubmitted that the PMLA serves a two-fold purpose of not only being\n\npenal, but also preventive in nature. In order to avoid a situation\n\nwhere the property involved in money-laundering disappears or is\n\ndisposed of before an FIR is filed in respect of predicate offence, the\n\nPMLA empowers seizure without an FIR.         Attention is invited to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_983\">Section 17(1)(iv)</a> of the PMLA, which uses the phrase ‘related to\n\ncrime’, and it is submitted that the use of these words show that the\n\nAuthority is empowered to seize such properties without an FIR in\n\norder to ascertain whether such properties pertain to a scheduled\n\noffence or whether such properties are proceeds of crime.          The\n\nargument of the private parties that the Authority under the PMLA\n\ncannot conduct a search on the same day without conducting any\n\ninvestigation, is also rebutted by the learned Additional Solicitor\n\nGeneral. It is submitted that in light of the mandate to record the\n\n\n\n424   (1969) 2 SCC 324\n425   (1985) 3 SCC 72\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_522\">\f                                   216</span>\n\nreasons to conduct the search/seizure in writing, such an\n\napprehension is ill-founded. Rather, a party aggrieved by the\n\nsufficiency or lack of such reasons, always has the option to agitate\n\nthe same before the Adjudicating Authority, when an application for\n\nthe retention of the records seized or frozen is filed.\n\n(xlv)    Lastly, it is submitted that by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/72194817/\" id=\"a_984\">Section 65</a> of the\n\nPMLA, the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_985\">Cr.P.C</a>. relating to search and seizure\n\ncannot be applied to proceedings under the Act. <a href=\"/doc/72194817/\" id=\"a_986\">Section 65</a> of the\n\nPMLA states that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_987\">Cr.P.C</a>. shall apply subject to the\n\ncondition that the same are not inconsistent with those of the PMLA.\n\nIt is submitted that the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_988\">Sections 17</a> and <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_989\">18</a>\n\nare self-contained with adequate safeguards, and will override the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_990\">Cr.P.C</a>. which are at variance.\n\n(xlvi)    In reply to the challenge of the private parties to the\n\napplicability of the proviso to Rule 3 of the Seizure Rules, 2005,\n\nlearned Additional Solicitor General submits that the rules framed\n\nunder a statute cannot be ultra vires the statute.        Prior to the\n\namendment of <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_991\">Section 17</a>, the proviso to the Section required that a\n\nreport be forwarded to the Magistrate under <a href=\"/doc/279174/\" id=\"a_992\">Section 157</a> of the\n\nCr.P.C. prior to the conduct of a search under <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_993\">Section 17</a>.

It is stated that <a href=\"/doc/192126/\" id=\"a_998\">Section 5(1)</a> was\n\namended vide <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_999\">Prevention of Money-Laundering (Amendment) Act,\n\n2009</a> and second proviso was inserted for the first time which made\n\nthe provision for ‘immediate attachment’ of the property involved in\n\nmoney-laundering.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_246\">(xlviii)        It was observed in the Mutual Evaluation Report of the\n\nFATF and the Asia Pacific Group that the confiscation of criminal\n\nproceeds depends on conviction of the accused under the scheduled\n\n\n\n426   (2015) 3 SCC 779.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_525\">\f                                 218</span><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_247\">\n\noffence, which gives rise to an apprehension of confiscation\n\nproceedings becoming infructuous if the accused dies during the\n\npendency of criminal proceedings.

Accordingly, <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1000\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1001\">8</a> were amended on the\n\nrecommendation of FATF, as pointed out above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_248\">(xlix) It is submitted that in the Fifty Sixth Report of the Standing\n\nCommittee on Finance relating to the 2011 Bill published by the Lok\n\nSabha Secretariat on 08.05.2012, it was proposed to delete the\n\nrequirement of framing of charge under the scheduled offence\n\nagainst a person before a property can be attached from such\n\nperson, as in a given case a property may come to rest with someone\n\nwho has nothing to do with the scheduled offence or even with the\n\noffence of money-laundering.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_249\">(l)   It was further proposed to make confiscation of property\n\nindependent of conviction of an accused under the scheduled\n\noffence, as in a given case money-laundering may be done by a\n\nperson who has not committed the scheduled offence or property\n\nmay come to rest with someone who has not committed any offence.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_526\">\f                                 219</span>\n\nTherefore, to avoid such situations, <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1002\">Section 8(5)</a> was proposed to be\n\namended so as to provide for attachment and confiscation of the\n\nproceeds of crime independent of conviction, so long as the predicate\n\noffence and the offence of money-laundering have taken place and\n\nthe property in question is involved in money-laundering.        The\n\nParliament acting on such recommendations amended sub-section\n\n(1) of <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1003\">Section 5</a> vide <a href=\"/doc/109078369/\" id=\"a_1004\">Prevention of Money-Laundering (Amendment)\n\nAct, 2012</a> and deleted the requirement that attachment can be made\n\nonly qua the person who has been charged for committing the\n\nscheduled offence. Further, <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1005\">Section 8(3)(a)</a> of the PMLA was also\n\namended to provide that on confirmation, the attachment would\n\ncontinue during the pendency of proceedings related to an offence\n\nunder the PMLA or under the corresponding law of any other\n\ncountry. Therefore, it is averred that <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1006\">Sections 5</a> and <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1007\">8</a> of the PMLA,\n\nas they now stand, enable the attachment and dispossession of the\n\npersons from the proceeds of crime without being dependent on the\n\nproceedings of the scheduled offence, in consonance with the\n\nrecommendations of the FATF and global standards.\n\n(li)   Further to show the link between second proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1008\">Section 5</a>\n\nand the scheduled offence, it is submitted that the prerequisite for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_527\">\f                                 220</span>\n\nthe application of ‘emergency attachment’ provision under second\n\nproviso to <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1009\">Section 5</a> of the PMLA is that the Authority concerned\n\nmust have some material in its possession showing that such\n\nproperty is involved in money-laundering, which clearly establishes\n\nthe link of second proviso with the scheduled offence. Relying on\n\nsub-section (5) of <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1010\">Section 8</a>, it is averred that the properties which\n\ncan be confiscated are properties involved in money-laundering and\n\nalso the properties used for the commission of the offence of money-\n\nlaundering.   It is submitted that the ambit of sub-section (1) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1011\">Section 5</a> is very wide, which not only covers persons who are\n\ninvolved in the commission of scheduled offence, but also any person\n\nin possession of the proceeds of crime, who need not be the person\n\naccused of PMLA offence or who is being tried for the scheduled\n\noffence. It is further submitted that it would not be correct to say\n\nthat ‘any property’ of ‘any person’ can be attached by invoking the\n\nsecond proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1012\">Section 5</a>, as the proviso only deals with the\n\nproperty which is involved in money-laundering. Further, it is stated\n\nthat the person whose property is sought to be attached may not be\n\ncharged under the scheduled offence. Therefore, it is urged that the\n\nscheme of second proviso is consistent with <a href=\"/doc/192126/\" id=\"a_1013\">Section 5(1)</a> of PMLA. It\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_528\">\f                                 221</span>\n\nis also submitted that under the second proviso the Parliament has\n\nprovided various safeguards in the form of conditions that have to\n\nbe satisfied before the power under the proviso can be invoked. It is\n\nstated that firstly, the power of provisional attachment can only be\n\nexercised by a high-ranking officer; secondly, such officer has to\n\nrecord the ‘reasons to believe’ that the property is proceeds of crime\n\nor involved in money-laundering and lastly, he should be satisfied\n\nthat if the property is not attached immediately, the confiscation\n\nproceedings under the PMLA will get frustrated.        Further, it is\n\nsubmitted that such belief must be formed on the basis of material\n\nin the possession of the officer.      It is then submitted that the\n\nexpression ‘property involved in money-laundering’ under the\n\nsecond proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1014\">Section 5</a> is wide enough to cover the proceeds of\n\ncrime as well. Therefore, it is submitted that only the property that\n\nis involved in the money-laundering can be attached under the\n\nsecond proviso and not ‘any property’. It is urged that the ambit of\n\nsecond proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1015\">Section 5</a> is wider than that of main provision of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1016\">Section 5</a> itself, as second proviso enables the attachment of ‘any\n\nproperty involved in money-laundering’, whereas the main provision\n\nonly allows the attachment of ‘proceeds of crime’.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_529\">\f                                        222</span>\n\n(lii) It is contended that although the function of a proviso is to add\n\nsomething or to carve out an exception on a subject not covered by\n\nthe main Section, however, in many cases, Courts have treated even\n\na proviso as ‘a substantive provision conferring substantive\n\npowers’427. It is further submitted that even <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1017\">Section 8(5)</a>, on the\n\nconclusion of the trial, not only permits confiscation of property\n\ninvolved in money-laundering but also the property used for the\n\ncommission of the offence of money-laundering. Therefore, such\n\ninterpretation of the second proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1018\">Section 5</a> of the PMLA is\n\nconsistent with the entire scheme of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_250\">(liii) Learned Additional Solicitor General has further refuted the\n\nargument of the private parties that the attachment of property\n\nequivalent in value of the proceeds of crime can only be done if the\n\nproceeds of crime are situated outside India. It is stated that it is\n\nmanifest from the definition of “proceeds of crime” under <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1019\">Section\n\n2(1)(u)</a> of the PMLA that the proceeds of crime would not only cover\n\nthe concerned property, but also the value of such property.

Fifthly, the Authority is mandated to file a\n\ncomplaint before the Adjudicating Authority within 30 days of the\n\norder of the provisional attachment. Sixthly, it is stated that the life\n\nof a provisional attachment order is 180 days or the date when the\n\nAdjudicating Authority makes an order under <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1027\">Section 8(2)</a> PMLA,\n\nwhichever is earlier.

Despite that, it had become\n\nnecessary to answer the other contentions which may otherwise\n\nrequire consideration in the event of the principal ground of\n\nchallenge is answered against the petitioners. In any case, until the\n\nlarger Bench decides that issue authoritatively, the authorities and\n\nthe Adjudicating Authority as well as the Courts are obliged to give\n\n\n\n441   Supra at Footnote No.90\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_560\">\f                                 242</span>\n\neffect to the amended provisions.

Sub-clause (ii), before\nsubstitution, stood as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">         “(ii) “the offences specified under Part B of the Schedule if the total value involved in\n         such offence is thirty lakh rupees or more;”\n449Subs. by the <a href=\"/doc/150547062/\" id=\"a_1092\">Finance Act, 2015</a> (20 of 2015), sec. 145(ii), for “thirty lakh rupees” (w.e.f.\n14.5.2015)\n450   Subs. by Act 21 of 2009 (see Footnote No.448)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_573\">\f                                 248</span>\n\nfacilitating the adjudication by the Adjudicating Authority referred\n\nto in Chapter III to adjudicate the matters in issue, including until\n\nthe filing of the complaint by the authority authorised in that behalf\n\nbefore the Special Courts constituted under <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1093\">Chapter VII of the Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_303\">The expression “proceedings”, therefore, need not be given a narrow\n\nmeaning only to limit it to proceedings before the Court or before the\n\nAdjudicating Authority as is contended but must be understood\n\ncontextually. This is reinforced from the scheme of the Act as it\n\nrecognises that the statement recorded by the Director in the course\n\nof inquiry, to be deemed to be judicial proceedings in terms of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1830223/\" id=\"a_1094\">Section 50(4)</a> of the 2002 Act.     Needless to underscore that the\n\nauthorities referred to in <a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_1095\">Section 48</a> of the Act are distinct from the\n\nAdjudicating Authority referred to in <a href=\"/doc/719602/\" id=\"a_1096\">Section 6</a> of the 2002 Act. The\n\nAdjudicating Authority referred to in <a href=\"/doc/719602/\" id=\"a_1097\">Section 6</a> is entrusted with the\n\ntask of adjudicating the matters in issue for confirmation of the\n\nprovisional attachment order issued under <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1098\">Section 5</a> of the 2002 Act,\n\npassed by the Authority referred to in <a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_1099\">Section 48</a> of the Act. The\n\nconfirmation of provisional attachment order is done by the\n\nAdjudicating Authority under <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1100\">Section 8</a> of the 2002 Act, and if\n\nconfirmed, the property in question is ordered to be confiscated and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_574\">\f                                   249</span>\n\nthen it would vest in the Central Government as per <a href=\"/doc/775154/\" id=\"a_1101\">Section 9</a> of the\n\n2002 Act subject to the outcome of the trial of the offence under the\n\n2002 Act (i.e., <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1102\">Section 3</a> of offence of money-laundering punishable\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1693109/\" id=\"a_1103\">Section 4</a>).       Suffice it to observe that the expression\n\n“proceedings” must be given expansive meaning to include actions\n\nof the authorities (i.e., <a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_1104\">Section 48</a>) and of the Adjudicating Authority\n\n(i.e., <a href=\"/doc/719602/\" id=\"a_1105\">Section 6</a>), including before the Special Court (i.e., <a href=\"/doc/1374738/\" id=\"a_1106\">Section 43</a>).\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_304\">27. The task of the Director or an authority authorised by the\n\nCentral Government under the 2002 Act for the collection of\n\nevidence is the intrinsic process of adjudication proceedings.        In\n\nthat, the evidence so collected by the authorities is placed before the\n\nAdjudicating Authority for determination of the issue as to whether\n\nthe provisional attachment order issued under <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1107\">Section 5</a> deserves to\n\nbe confirmed and to direct confiscation of the property in question.\n\nThe expression “investigation”, therefore, must be regarded as\n\ninterchangeable with the function of “inquiry” to be undertaken by\n\nthe authorities for submitting such evidence before the Adjudicating\n\nAuthority.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_575\">\f                                  250</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_305\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_306\">28. In other words, merely because the expression used is\n\n“investigation” — which is similar to the one noted in <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_1108\">Section 2(h)</a> of\n\nthe 1973 Code, it does not limit itself to matter of investigation\n\nconcerning the offence under the Act and <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1109\">Section 3</a> in particular. It\n\nis a different matter that the material collected during the inquiry by\n\nthe authorities is utilised to bolster the allegation in the complaint\n\nto be filed against the person from whom the property has been\n\nrecovered, being the proceeds of crime.      Further, the expression\n\n“investigation” used in the 2002 Act is interchangeable with the\n\nfunction of “inquiry” to be undertaken by the Authorities under the\n\nAct, including collection of evidence for being presented to the\n\nAdjudicating Authority for its consideration for confirmation of\n\nprovisional attachment order. We need to keep in mind that the\n\nexpanse of the provisions of the 2002 Act is of prevention of money-\n\nlaundering, attachment of proceeds of crime, adjudication and\n\nconfiscation thereof, including vesting of it in the Central\n\nGovernment and also setting up of agency and mechanism for\n\ncoordinating measures for combating money-laundering.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_576\">\f                                       251</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_307\">29. Coming to the next relevant definition is expression “money-\n\nlaundering”, it has the meaning assigned to it in <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1110\">Section 3</a> of the Act.\n\nWe would dilate on this aspect while dealing with the purport of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1111\">Section 3</a> of the Act a little later.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_308\">30. The other relevant definition is “proceeds of crime” in <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1112\">Section\n\n2(1)(u)</a> of the 2002 Act. This definition is common to all actions\n\nunder the Act, namely, attachment, adjudication and confiscation\n\nbeing civil in nature as well as prosecution or criminal action. The\n\noriginal provision prior to amendment vide <a href=\"/doc/150547062/\" id=\"a_1113\">Finance Act, 2015</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/105739094/\" id=\"a_1114\">Finance (No.2) Act, 2019</a>, took within its sweep any property\n\n(mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1115\">Section 2(1)(v)</a> of the Act) derived or obtained, directly\n\nor indirectly, by any person “as a result of” criminal activity “relating\n\nto” a scheduled offence (mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1116\">Section 2(1)(y)</a> read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1117\">Schedule to the Act</a>) or the value of any such property. Vide Finance\n\nAct, 2015, it further included such property (being proceeds of crime)\n\nwhich is taken or held outside the country, then the property\n\nequivalent in value held within the country and by further\n\namendment vide Act 13 of 2018, it also added property which is\n\nabroad.    By further amendment vide <a href=\"/doc/105739094/\" id=\"a_1118\">Finance (No.2) Act, 2019</a>,\n\nExplanation has been added which is obviously a clarificatory\n\namendment.        That is evident from the plain language of\n\nthe inserted Explanation itself. The fact that it also includes any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_577\">\f                                   252</span>\n\nproperty which may, directly or indirectly, be derived as a result of\n\nany criminal activity relatable to scheduled offence does not\n\ntranscend beyond the original provision. In that, the word “relating\n\nto” (associated with/has to do with) used in the main provision is a\n\npresent participle of word “relate” and the word “relatable” is only an\n\nadjective. The thrust of the original provision itself is to indicate that\n\nany property is derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, as a result\n\nof criminal activity concerning the scheduled offence, the same be\n\nregarded as proceeds of crime. In other words, property in whatever\n\nform mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1119\">Section 2(1)(v)</a>, is or can be linked to criminal\n\nactivity relating to or relatable to scheduled offence, must be\n\nregarded as proceeds of crime for the purpose of the 2002 Act. It\n\nmust follow that the Explanation inserted in 2019 is merely\n\nclarificatory and restatement of the position emerging from the\n\nprincipal provision [i.e., <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1120\">Section 2(1)(u)</a>].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_309\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_310\">31. The “proceeds of crime” being the core of the ingredients\n\nconstituting the offence of money-laundering, that expression needs\n\nto be construed strictly. In that, all properties recovered or attached\n\nby the investigating agency in connection with the criminal activity\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_578\">\f                                 253</span>\n\nrelating to a scheduled offence under the general law cannot be\n\nregarded as proceeds of crime.      There may be cases where the\n\nproperty involved in the commission of scheduled offence attached\n\nby the investigating agency dealing with that offence, cannot be\n\nwholly or partly regarded as proceeds of crime within the meaning\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1121\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> of the 2002 Act — so long as the whole or some\n\nportion of the property has been derived or obtained by any person\n\n“as a result of” criminal activity relating to the stated scheduled\n\noffence. To be proceeds of crime, therefore, the property must be\n\nderived or obtained, directly or indirectly, “as a result of” criminal\n\nactivity relating to a scheduled offence. To put it differently, the\n\nvehicle used in commission of scheduled offence may be attached as\n\nproperty in the concerned case (crime), it may still not be proceeds\n\nof crime within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1122\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> of the 2002 Act.\n\nSimilarly, possession of unaccounted property acquired by legal\n\nmeans may be actionable for tax violation and yet, will not be\n\nregarded as proceeds of crime unless the concerned tax legislation\n\nprescribes such violation as an offence and such offence is included\n\nin the Schedule of the 2002 Act. For being regarded as proceeds of\n\ncrime, the property associated with the scheduled offence must have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_579\">\f                                  254</span>\n\nbeen derived or obtained by a person “as a result of” criminal activity\n\nrelating to the concerned scheduled offence. This distinction must\n\nbe borne in mind while reckoning any property referred to in the\n\nscheduled offence as proceeds of crime for the purpose of the 2002\n\nAct. Dealing with proceeds of crime by way of any process or activity\n\nconstitutes offence of money-laundering under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1123\">Section 3</a> of the Act.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_311\">32. Be it noted that the definition clause includes any property\n\nderived or obtained “indirectly” as well. This would include property\n\nderived or obtained from the sale proceeds or in a given case in lieu\n\nof or in exchange of the “property” which had been directly derived\n\nor obtained as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled\n\noffence. In the context of Explanation added in 2019 to the definition\n\nof expression “proceeds of crime”, it would inevitably include other\n\nproperty which may not have been derived or obtained as a result of\n\nany criminal activity relatable to the scheduled offence. As noticed\n\nfrom the definition, it essentially refers to “any property” including\n\nabroad derived or obtained directly or indirectly. The Explanation\n\nadded in 2019 in no way travels beyond that intent of tracking and\n\nreaching upto the property derived or obtained directly or indirectly\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_580\">\f                                 255</span>\n\nas a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence.\n\nTherefore, the Explanation is in the nature of clarification and not\n\nto increase the width of the main definition “proceeds of crime”. The\n\ndefinition of “property” also contains Explanation which is for the\n\nremoval of doubts and to clarify that the term property includes\n\nproperty of any kind used in the commission of an offence under the\n\n2002 Act or any of the scheduled offences. In the earlier part of this\n\njudgment, we have already noted that every crime property need not\n\nbe termed as proceeds of crime but the converse may be true.\n\nAdditionally, some other property is purchased or derived from the\n\nproceeds of crime even such subsequently acquired property must\n\nbe regarded as tainted property and actionable under the Act. For,\n\nit would become property for the purpose of taking action under the\n\n2002 Act which is being used in the commission of offence of money-\n\nlaundering. Such purposive interpretation would be necessary to\n\nuphold the purposes and objects for enactment of 2002 Act.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_312\">33. Tersely put, it is only such property which is derived or\n\nobtained, directly or indirectly, as a result of criminal activity\n\nrelating to a scheduled offence can be regarded as proceeds of crime.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_581\">\f                                  256</span>\n\nThe authorities under the 2002 Act cannot resort to action against\n\nany person for money-laundering on an assumption that the\n\nproperty recovered by them must be proceeds of crime and that a\n\nscheduled offence has been committed, unless the same is registered\n\nwith the jurisdictional police or pending inquiry by way of complaint\n\nbefore the competent forum. For, the expression “derived or\n\nobtained” is indicative of criminal activity relating to a scheduled\n\noffence already accomplished.      Similarly, in the event the person\n\nnamed in the criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence is\n\nfinally absolved by a Court of competent jurisdiction owing to an\n\norder of discharge, acquittal or because of quashing of the criminal\n\ncase (scheduled offence) against him/her, there can be no action for\n\nmoney-laundering against such a person or person claiming through\n\nhim in relation to the property linked to the stated scheduled offence.\n\nThis interpretation alone can be countenanced on the basis of the\n\nprovisions of the 2002 Act, in particular <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1124\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1125\">Section 3</a>.   Taking any other view would be rewriting of these\n\nprovisions and disregarding the express language of definition\n\nclause “proceeds of crime”, as it obtains as of now.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_582\">\f                                 257</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_313\">34. By and large the debate today is restricted to the discrepancy\n\nbetween the word ‘and’, which features in the original definition,\n\nagainst the ‘or’ in the newly inserted Explanation in <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1126\">Section 3</a>. While\n\nthe stand of the Government is that there is no requirement under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1127\">Section 3</a> to project or claim the proceeds of crime as untainted\n\nproperty. The petitioners have claimed that said interpretation will\n\nbe unconstitutional. For, the requirement is that not only does a\n\npredicate crime need to be committed, it in turn needs to generate\n\nproceeds of crime and it must also then be projected as untainted\n\nproperty to qualify for the crime of money-laundering. The general\n\nscheme of the law of this land is that any law which is questioned is\n\npresumed to be unblemished and within the confines of the\n\nConstitutional principles so laid down within the Constitution. Yet,\n\nas the arguments, challenges laid against the interpretation of the\n\nimpugned section are so many we find it necessary to see how India\n\nembarked on the framing of the definition of “money-laundering”\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1128\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act. Thereafter, we will see how the\n\nParliament over the years responded to changes and suggestions\n\nfrom the outside world, notably the FATF. Thus, in seriatim we\n\nendeavour to see the international Conventions which led to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_583\">\f                                     258</span>\n\nevolution of money-laundering, based on which the Government\n\ndecided to enact the law, followed by the FATF recommendations\n\nwhich have led to the amendments, then the debates in the\n\nParliament of India followed by the law of the land as <a href=\"/doc/117903/\" id=\"a_1129\">laid down by</a>\n\nthis Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_314\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_315\">35. For untying the knot, how money-laundering evolved — it is\n\ntrite to refer to the tenets that have been <a href=\"/doc/117903/\" id=\"a_1130\">laid down in</a> what are\n\ncommonly referred to as the Palermo and Vienna Conventions. The\n\nfirst step ever taken towards ridding the world of money-laundering\n\nwere made in the Vienna Convention, 1988 wherein under <a href=\"/doc/1203297/\" id=\"a_1131\">Articles\n\n3.1(b)(i)</a>,(ii),(c)(i) to (iv), 3.2 and 3.3, it was held as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">                                   “Article 3\n                            OFFENCES AND SANCTIONS\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">          1.

There   has   been    a    consensus   that   acquisition,\n\npossession, use, concealing or disguising the illicit origin of\n\nillegitimately obtained money to evade legal consequences would be\n\nmoney-laundering. Further, concealing and disguising too were\n\nclearly a part of money-laundering and as such there was no bar or\n\nunderstating that pointed to the fact that there was a need to project\n\nthe monies as untainted. This was obviously subject to the\n\nfundamental principles of the domestic law of the countries.\n\nHowever, the growth of the jurisprudence in this law did not stop or\n\nend there. As we progressed into a world equipped with the internet\n\nand into a digital age, criminals found new ways to launder and the\n\nlaw found new ways to tackle them. In the meanwhile, the FATF was\n\nestablished and it started working towards a goal of preventing\n\nmoney-laundering. It has since its inception been aimed towards\n\nreducing cross border and intra State money-laundering activities.\n\nIn this endeavour, it has made many concerted efforts to study,\n\nunderstand, develop and mutually evaluate the state of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_588\">\f                                  263</span>\n\ncompliance in countries towards reducing money-laundering.\n\nToday, as we will see, many of the amendments in the 2002 Act are\n\nin response to the recommendations of the FATF. Thereafter, forty\n\nrecommendations dated 20.6.2003, were made by the FATF which\n\nhad led to much deliberations go on to show that all endeavours\n\nwere to be Vienna and Palermo Conventions compliant. During the\n\nevolution of the jurisprudence on money-laundering, it was found\n\nthat India was in fact lacking in some aspects of curbing money-\n\nlaundering. Hence, the recommendations were made to India time\n\nand again. It is pertinent also to reproduce the Mutual Evaluation of\n\nthe Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Combating the Financing of\n\nTerrorism (CFT) regime of India as adopted on 24.06.2010 in its\n\nrecommendations, as it has been shown that it is based on these\n\nobservations that the amendment have been made, herein it has\n\nbeen observed thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">         “Recommendation 1\n         ….\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">         Consistency with the United Nations Conventions\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">         137. The Vienna and Palermo Conventions require\n         countries to establish a criminal offence for the\n         following knowing/intentional acts: conversion or\n         transfer of proceeds for specific purposes; concealment\n         or disguise of the true nature, source, location,\n         disposition, movement or ownership of or rights with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_589\">\f                           264</span>\n\nrespect to proceeds; and - subject to the\nfundamental/constitutional    principles   or    basic\nconcepts of the country‘s legal system - the sole\nacquisition, possession or use of proceeds (Art.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_325\">3(1)(b)&amp;(c) of the Vienna Convention; and <a href=\"/doc/241477/\" id=\"a_1138\">Art. 6(1)</a> of\nthe Palermo Convention against Transnational\nOrganised Crime – the TOC Convention).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_326\">138. <a href=\"/doc/53299998/\" id=\"a_1139\">Section 8A</a> of the NDPS Act offence is an almost\nfaithful transposition of the Vienna Convention ML\nprovisions. The PMLA takes a different approach by using\na terminology that by its broad wording is intended to\ngenerally correspond with the criminal activity targeted by\nboth the Vienna and Palermo Conventions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_327\">139. As said, the PMLA (s.3) provides that money\nlaundering is committed where someone “directly or\nindirectly attempts to indulge, knowingly assists or\nknowingly is a party or is actually involved in any process\nor activity connected with the proceeds of crime and\nprojecting it as untainted property”. The <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1140\">section 3</a> mens rea\nthreshold is lower than the <a href=\"/doc/241477/\" id=\"a_1141\">Art. 6.1(a)</a> of the TOC\nConvention in that no specific purpose or intention is\nrequired. The substantive element of “projecting it as\nuntainted property” carries the notion of knowing\ndisguise, as required by the Conventions, but does not\nappear to cover all concealment activity, such as the\nphysical hiding of the assets.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_328\">……\nRecommendation 2\nScope of liability\n……\nImplementation and effectiveness\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_329\">164. When the PMLA was enacted on 1 July 2005\nimplementing the Palermo TOC Convention, it was already\nclear that the scope of the law was too restrictive to\nwithstand the test of the relevant international standards.\nWith the extension of the list of predicate offences under\nSchedule A and B, and the addition of Schedule C offences\nsince 1 June 2009, India has made a serious effort to\nbring the ML criminalisation of the PMLA in line with\nthe FATF criteria in this respect. It did not do away\nwith all shortcomings, however.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_590\">\f                            265</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_330\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_331\">165. Firstly, it is not clear why the legislator abandoned\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1142\">NDPS Act</a> approach to define the ML activity by\nsimply incorporating the relevant Convention language\nin the domestic law. With the <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1143\">section 3</a> of the PMLA money\nlaundering provision, a newly defined ML offence was\nintroduced differing from the comprehensive qualification\nof <a href=\"/doc/53299998/\" id=\"a_1144\">section 8A</a> of the NDPS Act that was not repealed,\nresulting in the coexistence of two divergent drug related\nML offences.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_332\">166. The new definition of the ML offence in <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1145\">section 3</a> of the\nPMLA tries to capture all requisite mental and physical\nelements of the Convention’s ML provision in one\noverarching sentence. The mens rea element is the\n“knowledge” standard as minimally required by the\nConventions. <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1146\">Section 3</a> of the PMLA does not require a\nspecific intention or purpose, and as such its threshold\nis lower than that of <a href=\"/doc/241477/\" id=\"a_1147\">Art. 6.1(a)(i)</a> of the TOC\nConvention. The provision however falls short on the\nfollowing actus reus aspects:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">    a. The physical element in all cases includes the\n    substantive condition of “projecting (the proceeds\n    of crime) as untainted property”, so although the\n    broad formulation of “any process or activity”\n    covers any conduct involving criminal proceeds,\n    such conduct is only criminalised as money\n    laundering when the property is concurrently\n    projected as untainted. While this “projection”\n    circumstance may correspond with the notion of\n    “disguise” as in <a href=\"/doc/241477/\" id=\"a_1148\">Art. 6.1(a)(ii)</a> of the TOC\n    Convention, it does not cover acts of physical\n    concealment without any “projecting” (such as\n    deposit in a safe), even if – as was argued - this act\n    is seen as an attempt to “project”, quod non.\n    b. With the imposition of the “projecting”\n    condition the PMLA offence does not extend to the\n    activity of sole “acquisition, possession or use” of\n    criminal proceeds as stated in <a href=\"/doc/241477/\" id=\"a_1149\">Article 6(1)(b)(i)</a> of\n    the TOC Convention, although this would not be\n    contrary to the basic concepts of the Indian legal\n    system. Only the offences of “holding” drug\n    proceeds <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1150\">(NDPS Act</a><a href=\"/doc/1754354/\" id=\"a_1151\"> s.68C</a>) or “proceeds of\n    terrorism” (UAPA<a href=\"/doc/1566465/\" id=\"a_1152\"> s.21</a>) are unconditional and may\n    be considered to cover “possession” situations in\n    these specific circumstances.

It is also clear\n\nfrom public records that India has time and again, since the\n\ninception of the Act, made active efforts to follow and evolve its own\n\nlaws in line with the mandates and recommendations of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_593\">\f                                          268</span>\n\nFATF. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that even in other jurisdictions;\n\nthe above-mentioned definition has gained a more holistic approach\n\nwhich is not per se the same as the colloquial term, “money launder”\n\nor simply turning black money into white. In the UK and Spain,\n\npossession of criminal proceeds is covered under money-laundering,\n\nsimilarly by way of interpretation, the same is the case in Germany\n\nand Italy452. Following these recommendations, amendments were\n\nbrought about in India. This in turn led to debates as can be seen\n\nfrom the following speeches which were made in the Parliament. We\n\nfirst note the speech of the then Finance Minister made on\n\n02.12.1999 in the Lok Sabha at the time of introducing the 1999\n\nBill, it is as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">            “………<a href=\"/doc/27905/\" id=\"a_1158\">The Foreign Exchange Regulation Act, 1973</a>\n            primarily made compensatory transactions (known as\n            Havala) illegal. The basic aim was to ensure that no one\n            contravenes the exchange control regulations through\n            unofficial channels. The emphasis was, therefore, on\n            violation of foreign exchange regulations rather than on\n            “money-laundering”. Money-laundering, that is the\n            cleansing of proceeds of crimes such as extortion,\n            treason, drug trafficking, gun running etc. poses a\n            serious threat to the integrity and sovereignty of a\n            country and also to its financial systems. This threat to\n            the nation and its economy has been recognised the\n            world over and several UN and other international\n            conventions have called upon member countries to\n            take legislative and other preventive measures to\n\n452National and International Anti-Money Laundering Law, Benjamin vogel and Jean-Baptiste\nMaillart, Max Planck Institute, 2020 ed. Pg. 798.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_594\">\f                                    269</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">        combat the menace of money-laundering. As India is a\n        signatory to some of these conventions, a committee\n        was set up to examine and suggest a draft legislation for\n        this purpose. Based on their report, a separate legislation\n        has been introduced with stringent penal provisions. At the\n        same time, there is a need to consolidate and amend the\n        law relating to foreign exchange consistent with the\n        liberalisation policies pursued during the last eight years.\n        While the provisions of Foreign Exchange Management Bill\n        make foreign exchange contraventions civil wrongs, the\n        offences under the prevention of Money-Laundering Bill\n        have been made criminal and will attract stringent\n        punishment.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">        ….\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">        The point I am making is that we have picked up certain\n        offences which are heinous, as I said in the beginning,\n        which are of very serious nature. We are bringing this\n        legislation on money- laundering so that receipts from\n        those crimes and properties acquired as a result\n        thereof, are dealt with under this Act. At the present\n        moment, we have no legislation which will deal exclusively\n        with this particular subject. So, we are bringing this Bill.”\n                                                (emphasis supplied)\n\n\nThis speech, thus, set the tone for the years to come in our fight\n\nagainst money-laundering. This law was enacted in 2002 yet\n\nbrought into force in 2005. Later, a speech was made by the then\n\nFinance Minister, who had introduced the Prevention of Money\n\nLaundering (Amendment) Bill, 2012 in the Rajya Sabha on\n\n17.12.2012\n\n        “SHRI P. CHIDAMBARAM: Mr. Deputy Chairman, Sir, I am\n        grateful to the hon. Members, especially ten hon. Members\n        who have spoken on this Bill and supported the Bill.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_335\">        Naturally, some questions will arise; they have arisen. It is\n        my duty to clarify those matters. Sir, firstly, we must\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_595\">\f                                   270</span>\n\n        remember that money-laundering is a very technically-\n        defined offence. It is not the way we understand\n        ‘money-laundering’ in a colloquial sense. It is a\n        technically-defined offence. It postulates that there\n        must be a predicate offence and it is dealing with the\n        proceeds of a crime. That is the offence of money-\n        laundering. It is more than simply converting black-\n        money into white or white money into black. That is an\n        offence under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_1159\">Income Tax Act</a>. There must be a crime\n        as defined in the Schedule. As a result of that crime, there\n        must be certain proceeds — It could be cash; it could be\n        property. And anyone who directly or indirectly indulges\n        or assists or is involved in any process or activity\n        connected with the proceeds of crime and projects it as\n        untainted property is guilty of offence of money-\n        laundering. So, it is a very technical offence. The\n        predicate offences are all listed in the Schedule. Unless\n        there is a predicate offence, there cannot be an offence\n        of money-laundering. Initially the thinking was unless\n        a person was convicted of the predicate offence, you\n        cannot convict him of money-laundering. But that\n        thinking is evolved now. The Financial Action Task\n        Force has now come around to the view that if the\n        predicate offence has thrown up certain proceeds and\n        you dealt with those proceeds, you could be found\n        guilty of offence of money-laundering. What we are\n        trying to do is to bring this law on lines of laws that are\n        commended by FATF and all countries have obliged to\n        bring their laws on the same lines. I just want to point to\n        some of my friends that this Bill was passed in 2002. In\n        2002, we felt that these provisions are sufficient. In the\n        working of the law, we found that the provisions have\n        certain problems. We amended it in 2005. We amended it\n        in 2009. We still find that there are some problems. The\n        FATF has pointed out some problems. And, we are\n        amending it in 2012. It is not finding fault with anyone.\n        All I am trying to say is that this is an evolutionary\n        process. Laws will evolve in this way, and we are amending\n        it again in 2012.”\n                                               (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_336\">36. It is seen that there is clear inclination to follow the\n\nrecommendations of the FATF, made from time to time. Yet, before\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_596\">\f                                   271</span>\n\nwe move forward, we must note other statements that were made\n\nbefore the latest amendment was made. In the Statement RE:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_95\">Amendment/Background/Justification for amendments to the 2002\n\nAct – Pg 226‐235 of the Debate on the Finance Bill, 2019 it was noted\n\nthat:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">         “….\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">         4. It has been experienced that certain doubts are also\n         raised as regards definition of ‘Offence of money\n         laundering’ included in <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1160\">section 3</a> of the Act of 2002. It\n         is observed that the legislative intent and object of the\n         Act of 2002 is wrongly construed as if all the activities\n         as mentioned therein are required to be present\n         together to constitute the offence of Money\n         Laundering. The intention of the legislature had always\n         been that a person shall be held to be guilty of offence\n         of money-laundering if he is found to have directly or\n         indirectly attempted to indulge or knowingly assisted\n         or knowingly is a party or is actually involved in any\n         one or more of the process of activity included in\n         <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1161\">section 3</a> of the Act of 2002. It is also observed that the\n         original intention of the legislature is wrongly\n         construed to interpret as if the offence of money\n         laundering is a one time instantaneous offence and\n         finishes with its concealment or possession or\n         acquisition or use of projecting it as untainted property\n         or claiming it as untainted property. The intention of\n         the legislature had always been that a person will be\n         held to be guilty of offence of money-laundering and\n         will be punished as long as person is enjoying the\n         “proceeds of crime” by its concealment or possession\n         or acquisition or use or projecting it as untainted\n         property or claiming it as untainted property or in any\n         manner whatsoever. Accordingly, an Explanation is\n         proposed to be inserted in <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1162\">section 3</a> of the Act of 2002\n         to clarify the above legislative intent.”\n                                               (emphasis supplied)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_597\">\f                                           272</span>\n\nThereafter, the following statement was made on two different\noccasions453:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_98\">             “SHRIMATI     NIRMALA       SITHARAMAN:      The    other\n            amendments are into the <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_1163\">PMLA, the Act</a> relating to black\n            money. On that, I would like to assure the Members\n            regarding the kind of amendments. In fact, I would like to\n            mention, well before that, the number of amendments,\n            which are coming through for the PMLA, which is of 2002\n            vintage. Eight are being proposed by us. Of the eight, six\n            are only explanations to the existing clause. The clause\n            itself is not being changed. We are only coming with\n            explanations. These explanations are being brought into\n            the Act because of pleading in the courts by some of\n            those who are accused and because of some kind of a\n            confusion or a grey area or an ambiguity which might\n            exist. Therefore, the amendment is not amendment of\n            the clause itself. It is more explaining the clause. …\n                      ***                    ***                  ***\n            SHRIMATI NIRMALA SITHARAMAN: More important is the\n            amendment to the PMLA; <a href=\"/doc/1697463/\" id=\"a_1164\">The Prevention of Money\n            Laundering Act</a>. There are, one or two, a couple of\n            amendments which are being made to the PMLA, which I\n            just want to elaborate a bit so that the hon. Members know\n            what is that we are doing to the PMLA. They are all\n            explanatory changes that we are bringing in. Of the eight\n            different changes that we are bringing into the PMLA, six\n            relate to explanatory notes because we find that in the\n            courts, many of those offenders under the PMLA–if there\n            are two cases happening–try to club both the cases\n            although they may be materially different and seek of a bail.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_337\">            Therefore, what happens is, a case which has a different\n            procedural matter is also clubbed together with the case\n            which is not procedural and at the end of the day, the law\n            does not get invoked in its true letter and spirit. So, such\n            changes in the definition and explanatory matters have\n            been done in the PMLA. One little proviso which was\n            not really relevant has been removed and another which\n            is being brought in again is more to make it clearer so\n            that PMLA, when invoked, becomes far more effective.\n\n\n\n453Seventeenth Series, Vol. III, First Session, 2019/1941 (Saka) No. 24, Thursday, July 18,\n2019 / Ashadha 27, 1941 (Saka)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_598\">\f                                         273</span>\n\n           So, these are        the    points    on   the   PMLA-related\n           matters.”454\n                                                      (emphasis supplied)\n\n\nIt is seen that even though there were multiple arguments in respect\n\nof the definition of Section 3455, yet we chose to implement the said\n\ndefinition in a particular way.                Later it was realised by the\n\nGovernment and the Parliament that with the passage of time and\n\nthe development of anti-money laundering jurisprudence world over,\n\ncertain changes were to be made in the definition of money-\n\nlaundering.      We do not find it prudent or necessary to run into\n\narguments of application of international law, as it is clear that the\n\nintentions of the successive Governments have been the same since\n\nday one of signing the international Conventions. It is only in light\n\nof this perception and understanding of the legislation that we have\n\nbeen implementing the recommendations of the FATF. However, we\n\nnote that there has been a constant flow of thought from the FATF\n\nrecommendations, directly into our polity, which has pushed the\n\n\n\n\n454 GOVERNMENT BILLS — Contd.

Coming to <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1166\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act, the same defines the\n\noffence of money-laundering. The expression “money-laundering”,\n\nordinarily, means the process or activity of placement, layering and\n\nfinally integrating the tainted property in the formal economy of the\n\ncountry. However, <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1167\">Section 3</a> has a wider reach. The offence, as\n\ndefined, captures every process and activity in dealing with the\n\nproceeds of crime, directly or indirectly, and not limited to the\n\nhappening of the final act of integration of tainted property in the\n\nformal economy to constitute an act of money-laundering. This is\n\namply clear from the original provision, which has been further\n\nclarified by insertion of Explanation vide <a href=\"/doc/105739094/\" id=\"a_1168\">Finance (No.2) Act, 2019</a>.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1169\">Section 3</a>, as amended, reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">         “3.

The\n\nexpression “proceeds of crime and projecting” was substituted by\n\nexpression “proceeds of crime including its concealment, possession,\n\nacquisition or use and projecting or claiming”. We are not so much\n\nconcerned with this change introduced vide Act 2 of 2013. In other\n\nwords, the provision as it stood prior to amendment vide Finance\n\n\n456Subs. by Act 2 of 2013, <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1170\">sec. 3</a>, for “proceeds of crime and projecting” (w.e.f. 15-2-2013, vide\nS.O. 343(E), dated 8-2-2013)\n457   Ins. by the <a href=\"/doc/105739094/\" id=\"a_1171\">Finance (No.2) Act, 2019</a>, sec. 193 (w.e.f. 1-8-2019)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_601\">\f                                  276</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/105739094/\" id=\"a_1172\">(No.2) Act, 2019</a> remained as it is.        Upon breaking-up of this\n\nprovision, it would clearly indicate that — it is an offence of money-\n\nlaundering, in the event of direct or indirect attempt to indulge or\n\nknowingly assist or being knowingly party or being actually involved\n\nin “any process or activity” connected with the proceeds of crime.\n\nThe latter part of the provision is only an elaboration of the different\n\nprocess or activity connected with the proceeds of crime, such as its\n\nconcealment, possession, acquisition, use, or projecting it as\n\nuntainted property or claiming it to be as untainted property. This\n\nposition stands clarified by way of Explanation inserted in 2019. If\n\nthe argument of the petitioners is to be accepted, that projecting or\n\nclaiming the property as untainted property is the quintessential\n\ningredient of the offence of money-laundering, that would whittle\n\ndown the sweep of <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1173\">Section 3</a>. Whereas, the expression “including”\n\nis a pointer to the preceding part of the section which refers to the\n\nessential ingredient of “process or activity” connected with the\n\nproceeds of crime. The Explanation inserted by way of amendment\n\nof 2019, therefore, has clarified the word “and” preceding the\n\nexpression “projecting or claiming” as “or”.         That being only\n\nclarificatory, whether introduced by way of Finance Bill or otherwise,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_602\">\f                                          277</span>\n\nwould make no difference to the main original provision as it existed\n\nprior to 2019 amendment. Indeed, there has been some debate in\n\nthe Parliament about the need to retain the clause of projecting or\n\nclaiming the property as untainted property.                 However, the\n\nExplanation inserted by way of amendment of 2019 was only to\n\nrestate the stand taken by India in the proceedings before the FATF,\n\nas recorded in its 8th Follow-Up Report Mutual Evaluation of India\n\nJune 2013 under heading “Core Recommendations”. This stand had\n\nto be taken by India notwithstanding the amendment of 2013 vide\n\nAct 2 of 2013 (w.e.f. 15.2.2013) and explanation offered by the then\n\nMinister of Finance during his address in the Parliament on\n\n17.12.2012 as noted above458. Suffice it to note that the municipal\n\nlaw (Act of 2002) had been amended from time to time to incorporate\n\nthe concerns and recommendations noted by the international body.\n\nWe may usefully refer to the Core Recommendations of the FATF\n\nconcerning India of June 2013, which reads thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">“Core Recommendations\n Recommendations             Rating Summary      of Actions taken to remedy\n                                    Factors         deficiencies\n                                    underlying\n                                    Rating\n 1-ML offence                PC     • (High)        Amendments to    India’s\n                                      monetary      Prevention of    Money\n\n458   See paragraph 35 of this judgment\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_603\">\f    278</span>\n\n threshold       Laundering Act (PMLA)\n condition   for were       enacted     by\n most        ML Parliament       on     17\n predicates.

The principle underlying this analysis by the\n\nConstitution Bench must apply proprio vigore to the interpretation\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1184\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"196582635\" id=\"span_613\">To the same end, this Court in the case\n\nof Ishwar Singh Bindra &amp; Ors. vs. The State of U.P.465, Joint\n\nDirector of Mines Safety466 and <a href=\"/doc/196582635/\" id=\"a_1185\">Gujarat Urja Vikas Nigam Ltd.\n\nvs. Essar Power Ltd.467</a>, interpreted the word “and” in the\n\nconcerned legislation(s) as word “or” to give full effect to the\n\nlegislative intent.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_351\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_352\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"392071\" id=\"span_614\">40. The Explanation as inserted in 2019, therefore, does not entail\n\nin expanding the purport of <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1186\">Section 3</a> as it stood prior to 2019, but\n\nis only clarificatory in nature.                   Inasmuch as <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1187\">Section 3</a> is widely\n\nworded with a view to not only investigate the offence of money-\n\nlaundering but also to prevent and regulate that offence.                     This\n\nprovision plainly indicates that any (every) process or activity\n\nconnected with the proceeds of crime results in offence of money-\n\nlaundering.           Projecting or claiming the proceeds of crime as\n\nuntainted property, in itself, is an attempt to indulge in or being\n\n\n465   (<a href=\"/doc/392071/\" id=\"a_1188\">1969) 1 SCR 219 (also at Footnote No.194</a>)\n466   Supra at Footnote No.195\n467   (2008) 4 SCC 755 (also at Footnote No.194)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_615\">\f                                          284</span>\n\ninvolved in money-laundering, just as knowingly concealing,\n\npossessing, acquiring or using of proceeds of crime, directly or\n\nindirectly. This is reinforced by the statement presented along with\n\nthe Finance Bill, 2019 before the Parliament on 18.7.2019 as noted\n\nabove468.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_353\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_354\">41. Independent of the above, we have no hesitation in construing\n\nthe expression “and” in <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1189\">Section 3</a> as “or”, to give full play to the said\n\nprovision so as to include “every” process or activity indulged into by\n\nanyone, including projecting or claiming the property as untainted\n\nproperty to constitute an offence of money-laundering on its own.\n\nThe act of projecting or claiming proceeds of crime to be untainted\n\nproperty presupposes that the person is in possession of or is using\n\nthe same (proceeds of crime), also an independent activity\n\nconstituting offence of money-laundering. In other words, it is not\n\nopen to read the different activities conjunctively because of the word\n\n“and”. If that interpretation is accepted, the effectiveness of <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1190\">Section\n\n3</a> of the 2002 Act can be easily frustrated by the simple device of one\n\nperson possessing proceeds of crime and his accomplice would\n\n\n468   See paragraph 36 of this judgment\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_616\">\f                                  285</span>\n\nindulge in projecting or claiming it to be untainted property so that\n\nneither is covered under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1191\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_355\">42. From the bare language of <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1192\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act, it is amply\n\nclear that the offence of money-laundering is an independent offence\n\nregarding the process or activity connected with the proceeds of\n\ncrime which had been derived or obtained as a result of criminal\n\nactivity relating to or in relation to a scheduled offence. The process\n\nor activity can be in any form — be it one of concealment, possession,\n\nacquisition, use of proceeds of crime as much as projecting it as\n\nuntainted property or claiming it to be so. Thus, involvement in any\n\none of such process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime\n\nwould constitute offence of money-laundering.            This offence\n\notherwise has nothing to do with the criminal activity relating to a\n\nscheduled offence — except the proceeds of crime derived or\n\nobtained as a result of that crime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_356\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_357\">43. Needless to mention that such process or activity can be\n\nindulged in only after the property is derived or obtained as a result\n\nof criminal activity (a scheduled offence). It would be an offence of\n\nmoney-laundering to indulge in or to assist or being party to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_617\">\f                                  286</span>\n\nprocess or activity connected with the proceeds of crime; and such\n\nprocess or activity in a given fact situation may be a continuing\n\noffence, irrespective of the date and time of commission of the\n\nscheduled offence. In other words, the criminal activity may have\n\nbeen committed before the same had been notified as scheduled\n\noffence for the purpose of the 2002 Act, but if a person has indulged\n\nin or continues to indulge directly or indirectly in dealing with\n\nproceeds of crime, derived or obtained from such criminal activity\n\neven after it has been notified as scheduled offence, may be liable to\n\nbe prosecuted for offence of money-laundering under the 2002 Act\n\n— for continuing to possess or conceal the proceeds of crime (fully\n\nor in part) or retaining possession thereof or uses it in trenches until\n\nfully exhausted. The offence of money-laundering is not dependent\n\non or linked to the date on which the scheduled offence or if we may\n\nsay so the predicate offence has been committed. The relevant date\n\nis the date on which the person indulges in the process or activity\n\nconnected with such proceeds of crime.         These ingredients are\n\nintrinsic in the original provision (<a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1193\">Section 3</a>, as amended until 2013\n\nand were in force till 31.7.2019); and the same has been merely\n\nexplained and clarified by way of Explanation vide Finance (No.2)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_618\">\f                                     287</span>\n\nAct, 2019. Thus understood, inclusion of Clause (ii) in Explanation\n\ninserted in 2019 is of no consequence as it does not alter or enlarge\n\nthe scope of <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1194\">Section 3</a> at all.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_358\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_359\">44. As mentioned earlier, the rudimentary understanding of\n\n‘money-laundering’ is that there are three generally accepted stages\n\nto money-laundering, they are:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">     (a)    Placement: which is to move the funds from direct\n\n     association of the crime.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">     (b)    Layering: which is disguising the trail to foil pursuit.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">     (c)    Integration: which is making the money available to the\n\n     criminal from what seem to be legitimate sources.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_360\">45. It is common experience world over that money-laundering can\n\nbe a threat to the good functioning of a financial system. However, it\n\nis   also   the   most    suitable     mode   for   the   criminals    to\n\ndeal in such money. It is the means of livelihood of drug dealers,\n\nterrorist, white collar criminals and so on. Tainted money breeds\n\ndiscontent in any society and in turn leads to more crime and civil\n\nunrest. Thus, the onus on the Government and the people to identify\n\nand seize such money is heavy. If there are any proactive\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_619\">\f                                  288</span>\n\nsteps towards such a cause, we cannot but facilitate the good steps.\n\nHowever, passions aside we must first balance the law to be able to\n\nsave the basic tenets of the fundamental rights and laws of this\n\ncountry. After all, condemning an innocent man is a bigger\n\nmisfortune than letting a criminal go.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_361\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_362\">46. On a bare reading of <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1195\">Section 3</a>, we find no difficulty in\n\nencapsulating the true ambit, given the various arguments\n\nadvanced. Thus, in the conspectus of things it must follow that the\n\ninterpretation put forth by the respondent will further the purposes\n\nand objectives behind the 2002 Act and also adequately address the\n\nrecommendations and doubts of the international body whilst\n\nkeeping in mind the constitutional limits. It would, therefore, be just\n\nto sustain the argument that the amendment by way of the\n\nExplanation has been brought about only to clarify the already\n\npresent words, “any” and “including” which manifests the true\n\nmeaning of the definition and clarifies the mist around its true\n\nnature.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_620\">\f                                          289</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_363\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_364\">47. We may profitably advert to the judgment in Seaford Court\n\nEstates ld.469, which states:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">               “The question for decision in this case is whether we are at\n               liberty to extend the ordinary meaning of “burden” so as to\n               include a contingent burden of the kind I have described.\n               Now this court has already held that this sub-section is to\n               be liberally construed so as to give effect to the governing\n               principles embodied in the legislation (Winchester Court Ld.\n               v. Miller470); and I think we should do the same. Whenever\n               a statute comes up for consideration it must be\n               remembered that it is not within human powers to\n               foresee the manifold sets of facts which may arise, and,\n               even if it were, it is not possible to provide for them in\n               terms free from all ambiguity. The English language is\n               not an instrument of mathematical precision. Our\n               literature would be much the poorer if it were. This is\n               where the draftsmen of Acts of Parliament have often\n               been unfairly criticized. A judge, believing himself to be\n               fettered by the supposed rule that he must look to the\n               language and nothing else, laments that the draftsmen\n               have not provided for this or that, or have been guilty\n               of some or other ambiguity. It would certainly save the\n               judges trouble if Acts of Parliament were drafted with\n               divine prescience and perfect clarity. In the absence of\n               it, when a defect appears a judge cannot simply fold his\n               hands and blame the draftsman. He must set to work\n               on the constructive task of finding the intention of\n               Parliament, and he must do this not only from the\n               language of the statute, but also from a consideration\n               of the social conditions which gave rise to it, and of the\n               mischief which it was passed to remedy, and then he\n               must supplement the written word so as to give “force\n               and life” to the intention of the legislature. That was\n               clearly laid down by the resolution of the judges in\n               Heydon&#x27;s case471, and it is the safest guide today. Good\n               practical advice on the subject was given about the\n               same time by Plowden in his second volume Eyston v.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">469   Supra at Footnote No.185\n470   [1944] K.B. 734\n471   (1584) 3 Co.

Put into homely metaphor it is this: A judge\n               should ask himself the question: If the makers of the\n               Act had themselves come across this ruck in the\n               texture of it, how would they have straightened it out?\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_365\">               He must then do as they would have done. A judge must\n               not alter the material of which it is woven, but he can\n               and should iron out the creases.”\n                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_366\">48.

We also cannot countenance the argument made in light of\n\npossible harassment of innocent persons. It is noted that to the 1999\n\nBill, the Select Committee of the Rajya Sabha had pointed out that\n\nif even mere possession of money/property out of proceeds of crime\n\nwere to be punishable then:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\">         “The Committee finds that sub-clauses (a) and (c) viewed ·in\n         the context of the provisions contained in clause 23 of the\n         Bill may lead to harassment of innocent persons who\n         bona fide and unknowingly deal with the persons who\n         have committed the offence of money laundering and\n         enter into transactions with them. Such persons\n         purchasing property born out of proceeds of crime without\n         having any inkling whatsoever about that are liable to be\n         prosecuted if the sub-Clauses (a) &amp; (c) remain in the Bill in\n         the existing form.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_120\">         The fact of the matter is that these sub-clauses do not\n         provide any protection or defence to this category of\n         persons.”\n                                                 (emphasis supplied)\n\nAccordingly, the phrase “and projecting it as untainted property”\n\nwas added the initial definition in the 2002 Act. However, it can also\n\nbe inferred from here that since the initial strokes of drafting the Act,\n\nthe intention was always to have a preventive Act and not simply a\n\nmoney-laundering (penal) Act. Today, if one dives deep into the\n\nfinancial systems, anywhere in the world, it is seen that once a\n\nfinancial mastermind can integrate the illegitimate money into the\n\nbloodstream of an economy, it is almost indistinguishable. In fact,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_636\">\f                                 295</span>\n\nthe money can be simply wired abroad at one click of the mouse. It\n\nis also well known that once this money leaves the country, it is\n\nalmost impossible to get it back. Hence, a simplistic argument or the\n\nview that <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1209\">Section 3</a> should only find force once the money has been\n\nlaundered, does not commend to us. That has never been the\n\nintention of the Parliament nor the international Conventions.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_372\">51. We may also note that argument that removing the necessity of\n\nprojection from the definition will render the predicate offence and\n\nmoney-laundering indistinguishable. This, in our view, is ill founded\n\nand fallacious. This plea cannot hold water for the simple reason\n\nthat the scheduled offences in the 2002 Act as it stands (amended\n\nupto date) are independent criminal acts. It is only when money is\n\ngenerated as a result of such acts that the 2002 Act steps in as soon\n\nas proceeds of crime are involved in any process or activity. Dealing\n\nwith such proceeds of crime can be in any form —being process or\n\nactivity. Thus, even assisting in the process or activity is a part of\n\nthe crime of money-laundering. We must keep in mind that for being\n\nliable to suffer legal consequences of ones action of indulging in the\n\nprocess or activity, is sufficient and not only upon projection of the\n\nill-gotten money as untainted money. Many members of a crime\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_637\">\f                                  296</span>\n\nsyndicate could then simply keep the money with them for years to\n\ncome, the hands of the law in such a situation cannot be bound and\n\nstopped from proceeding against such person, if information of such\n\nillegitimate monies is revealed even from an unknown source.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_373\">52. The next question is: whether the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1210\">Section 3</a> is a\n\nstandalone offence? Indeed, it is dependent on the wrongful and\n\nillegal gain of property as a result of criminal activity relating to a\n\nscheduled offence.    Nevertheless, it is concerning the process or\n\nactivity connected with such property, which constitutes offence of\n\nmoney-laundering.     The property must qualify the definition of\n\n“proceeds of crime” under <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1211\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> of the 2002 Act.           As\n\nobserved earlier, all or whole of the crime property linked to\n\nscheduled offence need not be regarded as proceeds of crime, but all\n\nproperties qualifying the definition of “proceeds of crime” under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1212\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> will necessarily be crime properties. Indeed, in the\n\nevent of acquittal of the person concerned or being absolved from\n\nallegation of criminal activity relating to scheduled offence, and if it\n\nis established in the court of law that the crime property in the\n\nconcerned case has been rightfully owned and possessed by him,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_638\">\f                                  297</span>\n\nsuch a property by no stretch of imagination can be termed as crime\n\nproperty and ex-consequenti proceeds of crime within the meaning\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1213\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> as it stands today. On the other hand, in the trial\n\nin connection with the scheduled offence, the Court would be obliged\n\nto direct return of such property as belonging to him. It would be\n\nthen paradoxical to still regard such property as proceeds of crime\n\ndespite such adjudication by a Court of competent jurisdiction. It is\n\nwell within the jurisdiction of the concerned Court trying the\n\nscheduled offence to pronounce on that matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_374\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_375\">53. Be it noted that the authority of the Authorised Officer under\n\nthe 2002 Act to prosecute any person for offence of money-\n\nlaundering gets triggered only if there exists proceeds of crime within\n\nthe meaning of <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1214\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> of the 2002 Act and further it is\n\ninvolved in any process or activity. Not even in a case of existence\n\nof undisclosed income and irrespective of its volume, the definition\n\nof “proceeds of crime” under <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1215\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> will get attracted, unless\n\nthe property has been derived or obtained as a result of criminal\n\nactivity relating to a scheduled offence. It is possible that in a given\n\ncase after the discovery of huge volume of undisclosed property, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_639\">\f                                  298</span>\n\nauthorised officer may be advised to send information to the\n\njurisdictional police (under <a href=\"/doc/1926081/\" id=\"a_1216\">Section 66(2)</a> of the 2002 Act) for\n\nregistration of a scheduled offence contemporaneously, including for\n\nfurther investigation in a pending case, if any. On receipt of such\n\ninformation, the jurisdictional police would be obliged to register the\n\ncase by way of FIR if it is a cognizable offence or as a non-cognizable\n\noffence (NC case), as the case may be. If the offence so reported is a\n\nscheduled offence, only in that eventuality, the property recovered\n\nby the authorised officer would partake the colour of proceeds of\n\ncrime under <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1217\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> of the 2002 Act, enabling him to take\n\nfurther action under the Act in that regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_376\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_377\">54. Even though, the 2002 Act is a complete Code in itself, it is\n\nonly in respect of matters connected with offence of money-\n\nlaundering, and for that, existence of proceeds of crime within the\n\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1218\">Section 2(1)(u)</a> of the Act is quintessential.       Absent\n\nexistence of proceeds of crime, as aforesaid, the authorities under\n\nthe 2002 Act cannot step in or initiate any prosecution.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_378\">55. In other words, the Authority under the 2002 Act, is to\n\nprosecute a person for offence of money-laundering only if it has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_640\">\f                                  299</span>\n\nreason to believe, which is required to be recorded in writing that the\n\nperson is in possession of “proceeds of crime”. Only if that belief is\n\nfurther supported by tangible and credible evidence indicative of\n\ninvolvement of the person concerned in any process or activity\n\nconnected with the proceeds of crime, action under the Act can be\n\ntaken forward for attachment and confiscation of proceeds of crime\n\nand until vesting thereof in the Central Government, such process\n\ninitiated would be a standalone process.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_379\">\n\nSECTION 5 OF THE 2002 ACT\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_380\">56. <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1219\">Section 5</a> forms part of Chapter III dealing with attachment,\n\nadjudication and confiscation. This provision empowers the Director\n\nor officer not below the rank of Deputy Director authorised by the\n\nDirector for the purposes of attachment of property involved in\n\nmoney-laundering. Such authorised officer is expected to act only if\n\nhe has reason to believe that any person is in possession of proceeds\n\nof crime. This belief has to be formed on the basis of material in his\n\npossession and the reasons therefor are required to be recorded in\n\nwriting.

This provision has been amended vide Act\n\n21 of 2009, Act 2 of 2013, <a href=\"/doc/150547062/\" id=\"a_1231\">Finance Act, 2015</a> and Act 13 of 2018, to\n\nstrengthen the mechanism keeping in mind the scheme of the 2002\n\nAct and the need to prevent and regulate the activity of money-\n\nlaundering. As regards the amendments made vide Act 21 of 2009\n\nand Act 2 of 2013, the same are not matters in issue in these cases.\n\nThe challenge is essentially to the amendment effected in the second\n\nproviso in sub-section (1), vide <a href=\"/doc/150547062/\" id=\"a_1232\">Finance Act, 2015</a>.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_395\">57. Be that as it may, as aforesaid, sub-section (1) delineates\n\nsufficient safeguards to be adhered to by the authorised officer\n\nbefore issuing provisional attachment order in respect of proceeds of\n\ncrime.   It is only upon recording satisfaction regarding the twin\n\nrequirements referred to in sub-section (1), the authorised officer\n\ncan proceed to issue order of provisional attachment of such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_646\">\f                                 305</span>\n\nproceeds of crime. Before issuing a formal order, the authorised\n\nofficer has to form his opinion and delineate the reasons for such\n\nbelief to be recorded in writing, which indeed is not on the basis of\n\nassumption, but on the basis of material in his possession. The\n\norder of provisional attachment is, thus, the outcome of such\n\nsatisfaction already recorded by the authorised officer. Notably, the\n\nprovisional order of attachment operates for a fixed duration not\n\nexceeding one hundred and eighty days from the date of the order.\n\nThis is yet another safeguard provisioned in the 2002 Act itself.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_396\">58. As per the first proviso, in ordinary situation, no order of\n\nprovisional attachment can be issued until a report has been\n\nforwarded to a Magistrate under Section 173 of the 1973 Code in\n\nrelation to the scheduled offence, or a complaint has been filed by a\n\nperson authorised to investigate the offence mentioned in that\n\nSchedule, before a Magistrate or Court for taking cognizance of the\n\nscheduled offence, as the case may be. It further provides that a\n\nsimilar report or complaint has been made or filed under the\n\ncorresponding law of any other country. In other words, filing of\n\npolice report or a private complaint in relation to the scheduled\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_647\">\f                                  306</span>\n\noffence had been made a precondition for issuing an order of\n\nprovisional attachment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_397\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_398\">59. The second proviso, as it existed prior to <a href=\"/doc/150547062/\" id=\"a_1233\">Finance Act, 2015</a>,\n\nhad predicated that notwithstanding anything contained in Clause\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_399\">(b) of sub-section (1) any property of any person may be attached in\n\nthe same manner and satisfaction to be recorded that non-\n\nattachment of property likely to frustrate any proceeding under the\n\n2002 Act. By amendment vide <a href=\"/doc/150547062/\" id=\"a_1234\">Finance Act, 2015</a>, the words “clause\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_400\">(b)” occurring in the second proviso came to be substituted to read\n\nwords “first proviso”. This is the limited change, but an effective one\n\nto give full play to the legislative intent regarding prevention and\n\nregulation of process or activity concerning proceeds of crime\n\nentailing in offence of money-laundering. Prior to the amendment,\n\nthe first proviso was rightly perceived as an impediment. In that, to\n\ninvoke the action of even provisional attachment order, registration\n\nof scheduled offence and completion or substantial progress in\n\ninvestigation thereof were made essential. This was notwithstanding\n\nthe urgency involved in securing the proceeds of crime for being\n\neventually confiscated and vesting in the Central Government.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_648\">\f                                  307</span>\n\nBecause of the time lag and the advantage or opportunities available\n\nto the person concerned to manipulate the proceeds of crime, the\n\namendment of 2015 had been brought about to overcome the\n\nimpediment and empower the Director or any other officer not below\n\nthe rank of Deputy Director authorised by him to proceed to issue\n\nprovisional attachment order. In terms of the second proviso, the\n\nauthorised officer has to record satisfaction and reason for his belief\n\nin writing on the basis of material in his possession that the property\n\n(proceeds of crime) involved in money-laundering if not attached\n\n“immediately”, would frustrate proceedings under the 2002 Act.\n\nThis is a further safeguard provided in view of the urgency felt by the\n\ncompetent authority to secure the property to effectively prevent and\n\nregulate the offence of money-laundering.        In other words, the\n\nauthorised officer cannot resort to action of provisional attachment\n\nof property (proceeds of crime) mechanically. Thus, there are inbuilt\n\nsafeguards provided in the main provision as well as the second\n\nproviso to be fulfilled upto the highest ranking ED official, before\n\ninvoking such urgent or “immediate” action. We fail to understand\n\nas to how such a provision can be said to be irrelevant much less\n\nmanifestly arbitrary, in the context of the purposes and objects\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_649\">\f                                 308</span>\n\nbehind the enactment of the 2002 Act.         Such provision would\n\nstrengthen the mechanism of prevention and regulation of process\n\nor activity resulting into commission of money-laundering offence;\n\nand also, to ensure that the proceeds of crime are properly dealt with\n\nas ordained by the 2002 Act, including for vesting in the Central\n\nGovernment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_401\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_402\">60.   As a matter of fact, prior to amendment of 2015, the first\n\nproviso acted as an impediment for taking such urgent measure even\n\nby the authorised officer, who is no less than the rank of Deputy\n\nDirector. We must hasten to add that the nuanced distinction must\n\nbe kept in mind that to initiate “prosecution” for offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1235\">Section 3</a> of the Act registration of scheduled offence is a\n\nprerequisite, but for initiating action of “provisional attachment”\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1236\">Section 5</a> there need not be a pre-registered criminal case in\n\nconnection with scheduled offence. This is because the machinery\n\nprovisions cannot be construed in a manner which would eventually\n\nfrustrate the proceedings under the 2002 Act. Such dispensation\n\nalone can secure the proceeds of crime including prevent and\n\nregulate the commission of offence of money-laundering.           The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_650\">\f                                 309</span>\n\nauthorised officer would, thus, be expected to and, also in a given\n\ncase, justified in acting with utmost speed to ensure that the\n\nproceeds of crime/property is available for being proceeded with\n\nappropriately under the 2002 Act so as not to frustrate any\n\nproceedings envisaged by the 2002 Act.       In case the scheduled\n\noffence is not already registered by the jurisdictional police or\n\ncomplaint filed before the Magistrate, it is open to the authorised\n\nofficer to still proceed under <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1237\">Section 5</a> of the 2002 Act whilst\n\ncontemporaneously sending information to the jurisdictional police\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1926081/\" id=\"a_1238\">Section 66(2)</a> of the 2002 Act for registering FIR in respect of\n\ncognizable offence or report regarding non-cognizable offence and if\n\nthe jurisdictional police fails to respond appropriately to such\n\ninformation, the authorised officer under the 2002 Act can take\n\nrecourse to appropriate remedy, as may be permissible in law to\n\nensure that the culprits do not go unpunished and the proceeds of\n\ncrime are secured and dealt with as per the dispensation provided\n\nfor in the 2002 Act. Suffice it to observe that the amendment effected\n\nin 2015 in the second proviso has reasonable nexus with the object\n\nsought to be achieved by the 2002 Act.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_651\">\f                                   310</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_403\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_404\">61. The third proviso in <a href=\"/doc/192126/\" id=\"a_1239\">Section 5(1)</a> of the 2002 Act is another\n\nsafeguard introduced vide Act 13 of 2018 about the manner in which\n\nperiod of one hundred and eighty days need to be reckoned thereby\n\nproviding for fixed tenure of the provisional attachment order.\n\nBefore the expiry of the statutory period relating to the provisional\n\nattachment order, the Director or any other officer not below the\n\nrank of Deputy Director immediately after attachment under sub-\n\nsection (1) is obliged to forward a copy of the provisional attachment\n\norder to the three-member Adjudicating Authority (appointed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1260593/\" id=\"a_1240\">Section 6(1)</a> of the 2002 Act, headed by, amongst other, person\n\nqualified for appointment as District Judge), in a sealed envelope\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/988610/\" id=\"a_1241\">Section 5(2)</a>, which is required to be retained by the\n\nAdjudicating Authority for the period as prescribed under the rules\n\nframed in that regard. This ensures the fairness in the action as\n\nalso accountability of the Authority passing provisional attachment\n\norder. Further, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1824537/\" id=\"a_1242\">Section 5(3)</a>, the provisional attachment\n\norder ceases to operate on the date of an order passed by the\n\nAdjudicating Authority under <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1243\">Section 8(3)</a> or the expiry of the period\n\nspecified in sub-section (1), whichever is earlier. In addition, under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1244\">Section 5(5)</a> the authorised officer is obliged to file a complaint before\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_652\">\f                                     311</span>\n\nthe Adjudicating Authority within a period of thirty days from such\n\nprovisional attachment. Going by the scheme of the 2002 Act and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1245\">Section 5</a> thereof in particular, it is amply clear that sufficient\n\nsafeguards have been provided for as preconditions for invoking the\n\npowers of emergency attachment in the form of provisional\n\nattachment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_405\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_406\">62. The background in which the amendment of 2013 became\n\nnecessary can be culled out from the Report titled “Anti-Money\n\nLaundering and Combating the Financing of Terrorism” dated\n\n25.6.2010. The relevant paragraphs of the said report read thus:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">         “143. It is no formal and express legal condition that a\n         conviction for the predicate offence is required as a\n         precondition to prosecute money laundering, although\n         some practitioners the assessment team met with felt\n         that only a conviction would satisfactorily meet the\n         evidentiary requirements. The definition of property in\n         the PMLA (see supra) however requires property to\n         be ―related to a scheduled offence. Consequently, the\n         <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1246\">section 3</a> ML offence not being an ―all crimes offence, in\n         the absence of case law, it is generally interpreted as\n         requiring at the very minimum positive proof of the\n         specific predicate offence before a conviction for money\n         laundering can be obtained, be it for third party or self-\n         laundering.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">         144.Similarly, under <a href=\"/doc/53299998/\" id=\"a_1247\">section 8A</a> of the NDPS Act,\n         although it is debatable that the person charged with\n         money laundering needs to have been convicted of a\n         predicate offence, the positive and formal proof of a nexus\n         with a drug related predicate offence is essential.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">                       ***           ***          ***\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_653\">\f                            312</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">168.The linkage and interaction of the ML offence with a\nspecific predicate criminality is historically very tight in\nthe Indian AML regime. The concept of stand-alone\nmoney laundering is quite strange to the practitioners,\nwho cannot conceive pursuing money laundering as a sui\ngeneris autonomous offence. Some interlocutors were\neven of the (arguably erroneous) opinion that only a\nconviction for the predicate criminality would effectively\nsatisfy the evidential requirements. As said, this attitude\nis largely due to the general practice in India to start a\nML investigation only on the basis of a predicate offence\ncase. Even if the ML investigation since recently can run\nconcurrently with the predicate offence enquiry, there is\nno inter-agency MOU or arrangement to deal with\nevidentiary issues between the various agencies in\ninvestigating predicates and ML offences. Also, the way\nthe interaction between the law enforcement agencies is\npresently structured carries the risk that ML\nprosecutions could be delayed while the other predicate\noffence investigation agencies try to secure convictions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">                ***           ***        ***\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">175.Although recently an increased focus on the ML\naspect and use of the ML provisions is to be\nacknowledged, there are still some important and often\nlong-standing legal issues to be resolved.

In the international\ncontext, the predicate conviction requirement also\nseriously affects the capacity to recover criminal assets\nwhere the predicate offence has occurred outside India\nand the proceeds are subsequently laundered in India\n(see also comments in <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_1251\">Section 2</a>.1 above).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">235. The definition of proceeds of crime and property in\nthe PMLA are broad enough to allow for confiscation of\nproperty derived directly or indirectly from proceeds of\ncrime relating to a scheduled (predicate) offence,\nincluding income, profits and other benefits from the\nproceeds of crime. These definitions also allow for value\nconfiscation, regardless of whether the property is held or\nowned by a criminal or a third party. As <a href=\"/doc/72194817/\" id=\"a_1252\">section 65</a> of the\nPMLA refers to the rules in <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1253\">CrPC</a>, instrumentalities and\nintended instrumentalities can be confiscated in\naccordance with <a href=\"/doc/648213/\" id=\"a_1254\">section 102</a> and <a href=\"/doc/768169/\" id=\"a_1255\">451</a> of the CrPC.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_407\">However, there is no case law in this respect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_408\">236.

In this connection, it may be useful to refer to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_656\">\f                                   315</span>\n\nthe Fifty Sixth Report of the Standing Committee on Finance relating\n\nto the 2011 Bill, which reads thus:\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_6\">         “5.

It is proposed to be\n         deleted as property may come to rest with someone,\n         who has nothing to do with the scheduled offence or\n         even the money-laundering offence.

As aforesaid, in this backdrop the amendment Act 2 of 2013\n\ncame into being. Considering the purport of the amended provisions\n\nand the experience of implementing/enforcement agencies, further\n\nchanges became necessary to strengthen the mechanism regarding\n\nprevention of money-laundering. It is not right in assuming that the\n\nattachment of property (provisional) under the second proviso, as\n\namended, has no link with the scheduled offence.                Inasmuch as\n\n<a href=\"/doc/192126/\" id=\"a_1262\">Section 5(1)</a> envisages that such an action can be initiated only on\n\nthe basis of material in possession of the authorised officer indicative\n\nof any person being in possession of proceeds of crime.                The\n\nprecondition for being proceeds of crime is that the property has\n\nbeen derived or obtained, directly or indirectly, by any person as a\n\nresult of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence. The sweep\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/192126/\" id=\"a_1263\">Section 5(1)</a> is not limited to the accused named in the criminal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_658\">\f                                   317</span>\n\nactivity relating to a scheduled offence. It would apply to any person\n\n(not necessarily being accused in the scheduled offence), if he is\n\ninvolved in any process or activity connected with the proceeds of\n\ncrime. Such a person besides facing the consequence of provisional\n\nattachment order, may end up in being named as accused in the\n\ncomplaint to be filed by the authorised officer concerning offence\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1264\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_417\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_418\">66. Be it noted that the attachment must be only in respect of\n\nproperty which appears to be proceeds of crime and not all the\n\nproperties belonging to concerned person who would eventually face\n\nthe action of confiscation of proceeds of crime, including prosecution\n\nfor offence of money-laundering. As mentioned earlier, the relevant\n\ndate for initiating action under the 2002 Act — be it of attachment\n\nand confiscation or prosecution, is linked to the inclusion of the\n\noffence as scheduled offence and of carrying on the process or\n\nactivity in connection with the proceeds of crime after such date.\n\nThe pivot moves around the date of carrying on the process and\n\nactivity connected with the proceeds of crime; and not the date on\n\nwhich the property has been derived or obtained by the person\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_659\">\f                                  318</span>\n\nconcerned as a result of any criminal activity relating to or relatable\n\nto the scheduled offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_419\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_420\">67. The argument of the petitioners that the second proviso\n\npermits emergency attachment in disregard of the safeguard\n\nprovided in the first proviso regarding filing of report (chargesheet)\n\nclearly overlooks that the second proviso contains non-obstante\n\nclause and, being an exceptional situation, warrants “immediate”\n\naction so that the property is not likely to frustrate any proceeding\n\nunder the 2002 Act. Concededly, there is stipulation fastened upon\n\nthe authorised officer to record in writing reasons for his belief on\n\nthe basis of material in his possession that such “immediate” action\n\nis indispensable. This stipulation has reasonable nexus with the\n\npurposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_421\">68. It was also urged before us that the attachment of property\n\nmust be equivalent in value of the proceeds of crime only if the\n\nproceeds of crime are situated outside India. This argument, in our\n\nopinion, is tenuous.    For, the definition of “proceeds of crime” is\n\nwide enough to not only refer to the property derived or obtained as\n\na result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence, but also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_660\">\f                                               319</span>\n\nof the value of any such property. If the property is taken or held\n\noutside the country, even in such a case, the property equivalent in\n\nvalue held within the country or abroad can be proceeded with. The\n\ndefinition of “property” as in <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1265\">Section 2(1)(v)</a> is equally wide enough\n\nto encompass the value of the property of proceeds of crime. Such\n\ninterpretation would further the legislative intent in recovery of the\n\nproceeds of crime and vesting it in the Central Government for\n\neffective prevention of money-laundering.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_422\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_423\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"9447\" id=\"span_661\">69. We find force in the stand taken by the Union of India that the\n\nobjectives of enacting the 2002 Act was the attachment and\n\nconfiscation of proceeds of crime which is the quintessence so as to\n\ncombat the evil of money-laundering. The second proviso, therefore,\n\naddresses the broad objectives of the 2002 Act to reach the proceeds\n\nof crime in whosoever’s name they are kept or by whosoever they are\n\nheld. To buttress this argument, reliance has been placed on the\n\ndictum in Attorney General for India494 and Raman Tech. &amp;\n\n<a href=\"/doc/9447/\" id=\"a_1266\">Process Engg. Co. &amp; Anr. vs. Solanki Traders495</a>.\n\n\n\n\n494   Supra at Footnote No.428 (also at Footnote No.175)\n495   (2008) 2 SCC 302 (also at Footnote No.430)</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_662\">\f                                  320</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_424\">70. The procedural safeguards provided in respect of provisional\n\nattachment are effective measures to protect the interest of the\n\nperson concerned who is being proceeded with under the 2002 Act,\n\nin the following manner as rightly indicated by the Union of India:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_164\">     i. For invoking the second proviso, the Director or any officer\n\n     not below the rank of Deputy Director will have to first apply\n\n     his mind to the materials on record before recording in writing\n\n     his reasons to believe is certainly a sufficient safeguard to the\n\n     invocation of the powers under the second proviso to <a href=\"/doc/192126/\" id=\"a_1267\">Section\n\n     5(1)</a> of the 2002 Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_165\">     ii. There has to be a satisfaction that if the property involved in\n\n     money-laundering or ‘proceeds of crime’ are not attached\n\n     “immediately”, such non-attachment might frustrate the\n\n     confiscation proceedings under the 2002 Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_166\">     iii. The order passed under <a href=\"/doc/192126/\" id=\"a_1268\">Section 5(1)</a> of the 2002 Act is only\n\n     provisional in nature.

Furthermore, the provisional attachment\n\nwould operate only for a period of one hundred and eighty days from\n\nthe date of order passed under <a href=\"/doc/192126/\" id=\"a_1344\">Section 5(1)</a> of the 2002 Act in terms\n\nof that provision. Whereas, <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1345\">Section 8(3)</a> refers to the period of three\n\nhundred and sixty-five days from the passing of the order under sub-\n\nsection (2) of <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1346\">Section 8</a> by the Adjudicating Authority and confirming\n\nthe provisional attachment order and the order of confirmation of\n\nattachment operates until the confiscation order is passed or\n\nbecomes final in terms of order passed under <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1347\">Section 8(5)</a> or 8(7) or\n\n58B or 60(2A) by the Special Court. The order of confirmation of\n\nattachment could also last during the pendency of the proceedings\n\nrelating   to   the   offence   of     money-laundering under      the\n\n2002 Act, or before the competent Court of criminal jurisdiction\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_681\">\f                                 334</span>\n\noutside India, as the case may be. We need not elaborate on this\n\naspect any further and leave the parties to agitate this aspect in\n\nappropriate proceedings as it is not about the constitutional validity\n\nof the provision as such.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_445\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_446\">73. The other grievance of the petitioners is in reference to the\n\nstipulation in sub-section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1348\">Section 8</a> providing for taking\n\npossession of the property. This provision ought to be invoked only\n\nin exceptional situation keeping in mind the peculiar facts of the\n\ncase.   In that, merely because the provisional attachment order\n\npassed under <a href=\"/doc/192126/\" id=\"a_1349\">Section 5(1)</a> is confirmed, it does not follow that the\n\nproperty stands confiscated; and until an order of confiscation is\n\nformally passed, there is no reason to hasten the process of taking\n\npossession of such property. The principle set out in <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1350\">Section 5(4)</a> of\n\nthe 2002 Act needs to be extended even after confirmation of\n\nprovisional attachment order until a formal confiscation order is\n\npassed.   <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1351\">Section 5(4)</a> clearly states that nothing in <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1352\">Section 5</a>\n\nincluding the order of provisional attachment shall prevent the\n\nperson interested in the enjoyment of immovable property attached\n\nunder sub-section (1) from such enjoyment.         The need to take\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_682\">\f                                  335</span>\n\npossession of the attached property would arise only for giving effect\n\nto the order of confiscation. This is also because sub-section (6) of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1353\">Section 8</a> postulates that where on conclusion of a trial under the\n\n2002 Act which is obviously in respect of offence of money-\n\nlaundering, the Special Court finds that the offence of money-\n\nlaundering has not taken place or the property is not involved in\n\nmoney-laundering, it shall order release of such property to the\n\nperson entitled to receive it. Once the possession of the property is\n\ntaken in terms of sub-section (4) and the finding in favour of the\n\nperson is rendered by the Special Court thereafter and during the\n\ninterregnum if the property changes hands and title vest in some\n\nthird party, it would result in civil consequences even to third party.\n\nThat is certainly avoidable unless it is absolutely necessary in the\n\npeculiar facts of a particular case so as to invoke the option available\n\nunder sub-section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1354\">Section 8</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_447\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_448\">74. Indisputably, statutory Rules have been framed by the Central\n\nGovernment in exercise of powers under <a href=\"/doc/1175622/\" id=\"a_1355\">Section 73</a> of the 2002 Act\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_683\">\f                                 336</span>\n\nregarding the manner of taking possession of attached or frozen\n\nproperties confirmed by the Adjudicating Authority in 2013, and also\n\nregarding restoration of confiscated property in 2019. Suffice it to\n\nobserve that direction under <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1356\">Section 8(4)</a> for taking possession of the\n\nproperty in question before a formal order of confiscation is passed\n\nmerely on the basis of confirmation of provisional attachment order,\n\nshould be an exception and not a rule. That issue will have to be\n\nconsidered on case-to-case basis.         Upon such harmonious\n\nconstruction of the relevant provisions, it is not possible to\n\ncountenance challenge to the validity of sub-section (4) of <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1357\">Section 8</a>\n\nof the 2002 Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_449\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_450\">75. The learned counsel appearing for the Union of India, had\n\ninvited our attention to the recommendations made by FATF in 2003\n\nand 2012 to justify the provision under consideration. The fact that\n\nnon-conviction based confiscation model is permissible, it does not\n\nwarrant an extreme and drastic action of physical dispossession of\n\nthe person from the property in every case — which can be\n\nindustrial/commercial/business and also residential property, until\n\na formal order of confiscation is passed under <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1358\">Section 8(5)</a> or 8(7) of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_684\">\f                                  337</span>\n\nthe 2002 Act. As demonstrated earlier, it is possible that the Special\n\nCourt in the trial concerning money-laundering offence may\n\neventually decide the issue in favour of the person in possession of\n\nthe property as not being proceeds of crime or for any other valid\n\nground. Before such order is passed by the Special Court, it would\n\nbe a case of serious miscarriage of justice, if not abuse of process to\n\ntake physical possession of the property held by such person.\n\nFurther, it would serve no purpose by hastening the process of\n\ntaking possession of the property and then returning the same back\n\nto the same person at a later date pursuant to the order passed by\n\nthe Court of competent jurisdiction. Moreover, for the view taken by\n\nus while interpretating <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1359\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act regarding the\n\noffence of money-laundering, it can proceed only if it is established\n\nthat the person has directly or indirectly derived or obtained\n\nproceeds of crime as a result of criminal activity relating to or\n\nrelatable to a scheduled offence or was involved in any process or\n\nactivity connected with proceeds of crime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_451\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_452\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1513039\" id=\"span_685\">76. It is unfathomable as to how the action of confiscation can be\n\nresorted to in respect of property in the event of his acquittal or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_686\">\f                                               338</span>\n\ndischarge in connection with the scheduled offence. Resultantly, we\n\nwould sum up by observing that the provision in the form of <a href=\"/doc/704277/\" id=\"a_1360\">Section\n\n8(4)</a> can be resorted to only by way of an exception and not as a rule.\n\nThe analogy drawn by the Union of India on the basis of decisions of\n\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/1513039/\" id=\"a_1361\">Divisional Forest Officer &amp; Anr. vs. G.V. Sudhakar\n\nRao &amp; Ors.510</a>, Biswanath Bhattacharya511, Yogendra Kumar\n\nJaiswal &amp; Ors. vs. State of Bihar &amp; Ors.512, will be of no avail in\n\nthe context of the scheme of attachment, confiscation and vesting of\n\nproceeds of crime in the Central Government provided for in the\n\n2002 Act.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_453\">\n\nSEARCHES AND SEIZURES\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_454\">77.

The provision is, therefore,\n\nunconstitutional.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_214\">78. These challenges have been rightly refuted by the Union of\n\nIndia on the argument that the 2002 Act is a self-contained Code\n\nand the dispensation envisaged thereunder, must prevail in terms of\n\nSection 71520A of the 2002 Act, which predicates that the provisions\n\nof the 2002 Act have effect notwithstanding anything inconsistent\n\ntherewith contained in any other law for the time being in force,\n\nwhich includes the provisions of the 1973 Code.

We have already noted in the earlier\n\npart of this judgment that before resorting to action of provisional\n\nattachment, registration of scheduled offence or complaint filed in\n\nthat regard, is not a precondition. The authorised officer can still\n\ninvoke power of issuing order of provisional attachment and\n\ncontemporaneously send information to the jurisdictional police\n\nabout the commission of scheduled offence and generation of\n\nproperty as a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled\n\noffence, which is being made subject matter of provisional\n\nattachment. Even in the matter of searches and seizures under the\n\n2002 Act, that power can be exercised only by the Director or any\n\nother officer not below the rank of Deputy Director authorised by\n\nhim. They are not only high-ranking officials, but have to be fully\n\nsatisfied that there is reason to believe on the basis of information\n\nin their possession about commission of offence of money-\n\nlaundering or possession of proceeds of crime involved in money-\n\nlaundering. Such reason(s) to believe is required to be recorded in\n\nwriting and contemporaneously forwarded to the Adjudicating\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_694\">\f                                 346</span>\n\nAuthority along with the material in his possession in a sealed\n\nenvelope to be preserved by the Adjudicating Authority for period as\n\nis prescribed under the Rules framed in that regard. Such are the\n\ninbuilt safeguards provided in the 2002 Act. The proviso as it existed\n\nprior to 2019 was obviously corresponding to the stipulation in the\n\nfirst proviso in <a href=\"/doc/1052372/\" id=\"a_1390\">Section 5</a>.       However, for strengthening the\n\nmechanism, including regarding prevention of money-laundering,\n\nthe Parliament in its wisdom deemed it appropriate to drop the\n\nproviso in sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_1391\">Section 17</a> of the 2002 Act, thereby\n\ndispensing with the condition that no search shall be conducted\n\nunless in relation to the scheduled offence a report has been\n\nforwarded to a Magistrate under Section 157 of the 1973 Code or a\n\ncomplaint has been filed before a Magistrate in regard to such\n\noffence. As it is indisputable that the 2002 Act is a special Act and\n\nis a self-contained Code regarding the subject of searches and\n\nseizures in connection with the offence of money-laundering under\n\nthe 2002 Act, coupled with the fact that the purpose and object of\n\nthe 2002 Act is prevention of money-laundering; and the offence of\n\nmoney-laundering being an independent offence concerning the\n\nprocess and activity connected with the proceeds of crime, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_695\">\f                                 347</span>\n\ndeletion of the first proviso has reasonable nexus with the objects\n\nsought to be achieved by the 2002 Act for strengthening the\n\nmechanism of prevention of money-laundering and to secure the\n\nproceeds of crime for being dealt with appropriately under the 2002\n\nAct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_473\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_474\">80. As aforementioned, <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_1392\">Section 17</a> provides for inbuilt safeguards,\n\nnot only mandating exercise of power by high ranking officials, of the\n\nrank of Director (not below the rank of Additional Secretary to the\n\nGovernment of India who is appointed by a Committee chaired by\n\nthe Central Vigilance Commissioner in terms of Section 25 of the\n\nCVC Act) or Deputy Director authorised by the Director in that\n\nregard, but also to adhere to other stipulations of recording of\n\nreasons regarding the belief formed on the basis of information in\n\nhis possession about commission of offence of money-laundering\n\nand possession of proceeds of crime involved in money-laundering.\n\nFurther, such recorded reasons along with the materials is required\n\nto be forwarded to the three-member Adjudicating Authority\n\n(appointed under <a href=\"/doc/719602/\" id=\"a_1393\">Section 6</a> of the 2002 Act headed by a person\n\nqualified for appointment as District Judge) in a sealed cover to be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_696\">\f                                   348</span>\n\npreserved   for   specified   period,    thus,   guaranteeing   fairness,\n\ntransparency and accountability regarding the entire process of\n\nsearch and seizure. This is unlike the provision in the 1973 Code\n\nwhere any police officer including the Head Constable can proceed\n\nto search and seize records or property merely on the basis of\n\nallegation or suspicion of commission of a scheduled offence.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_475\">81. Concededly, the 2002 Act provides for an inquiry to be\n\nconducted by the Authorities and with power to collect evidence for\n\nbeing submitted to the Adjudicating Authority for consideration of\n\nconfirmation of provisional attachment order passed by the\n\nAuthorities in respect of properties being proceeds of crime involved\n\nin the offence of money-laundering. In that sense, the provisions in\n\n2002 Act are not only to investigate into the offence of money-\n\nlaundering, but more importantly to prevent money-laundering and\n\nto provide for confiscation of property related to money-laundering\n\nand matters connected therewith and incidental thereto.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_476\">82. The process of searches and seizures under the 2002 Act are,\n\ntherefore, not only for the purposes of inquiring into the offence of\n\nmoney-laundering, but also for the purposes of prevention of money-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_697\">\f                                     349</span>\n\nlaundering.           This is markedly distinct from the process of\n\ninvestigating into a scheduled offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_477\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_478\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"196913\" id=\"span_698\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_699\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"196913\" id=\"span_700\">83. It is pertinent to note that if the action taken by the Authority\n\nunder the 2002 Act, including regarding searches and seizures, is\n\neventually found to be without reasons recorded in writing, would\n\nentail punishment for vexatious search under <a href=\"/doc/1790095/\" id=\"a_1394\">Section 62</a> of the 2002\n\nAct. Such being the stringent safeguards provided under <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_1395\">Section 17</a>\n\nof the 2002 Act and Rules framed regarding the process of searches\n\nand seizures concerning the offence of money-laundering and for\n\nprevention of money-laundering including attachment of proceeds of\n\ncrime, it is unfathomable as to how the challenge under\n\nconsideration can be countenanced. We may usefully advert to the\n\ndecision of Constitution Bench of this Court in Pooran Mal523,\n\nwhich had dealt with similar power entrusted to the Director of\n\nInspection or the Commissioner under the <a href=\"/doc/789969/\" id=\"a_1396\">Income-tax Act, 1961</a>\n\n(also see Income-Tax Officer, Special Investigation Circle-B,\n\nMeerut524).

As noticed earlier, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_1402\">Section 17(2)</a> of the 2002 Act\n\nimmediately after the search and seizure, the Authority conducting\n\nthe search is obliged to forward a copy of the reasons recorded and\n\nmaterials in his possession to the Adjudicating Authority in a sealed\n\nenvelope. This sealed envelope is required to be preserved for period\n\nas specified under the Rules framed in that regard so that it is not\n\ntempered with in any manner and to ensure fairness of the\n\nprocedure including accountability of the Authority. Not only that,\n\nin terms of <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_1403\">Section 17(4)</a> of the 2002 Act the Authority seizing the\n\n\n\n\n525   (<a href=\"/doc/392071/\" id=\"a_1404\">1967) 2 SCR 340 (also at Footnote No.417</a>)\n526   Supra at Footnote No.425\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_703\">\f                                 351</span>\n\nrecord or property is obliged to submit an application before the\n\nAdjudicating Authority within a period of thirty days therefrom for\n\nthe retention of the said record and Adjudicating Authority in turn\n\ngives opportunity to be heard by issuing show cause notice to the\n\nperson concerned before passing order of retention of record or\n\nproperty, as the case may be, under the 2002 Act and the Rules\n\nframed therefor. The Authorities carrying out search and seizure is\n\nalso made accountable by providing for punishment under <a href=\"/doc/1790095/\" id=\"a_1405\">Section\n\n62</a> of the 2002 Act for vexatious search and giving false information.\n\nAll these inbuilt safeguards prevent arbitrary exercise or misuse of\n\npower by the authorities appointed under the 2002 Act.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_481\">85. The emphasis placed on Section 102 of the 1973 Code\n\nregarding seizure procedure by the petitioners, is of no avail. That\n\nprovision does not provide for any safeguard prior to a seizure as is\n\nprovided under <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_1406\">Section 17</a> of the 2002 Act and the Rules framed\n\nthereunder.   As noted earlier, it can be made even by a Head\n\nConstable as the expression used is “any police officer” that too\n\nmerely on the basis of an allegation or suspicion of commission of\n\nan offence.   In case of search, Section 165 of the 1973 Code\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_704\">\f                                  352</span>\n\nempowers the officer in-charge of a police station or a police officer\n\nmaking an investigation to take recourse to that in the event he has\n\nreasonable grounds for believing that it would be necessary to do so\n\nfor investigating into any offence. This power can be exercised by any\n\npolice officer (irrespective of his rank) investigating into an offence.\n\nSuffice it to observe that the power of search and seizure entrusted\n\nto the Authorities under <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_1407\">Section 17</a> of the 2002 Act, is a special self-\n\ncontained provision and is different from the general provisions in\n\nthe 1973 Code, which, therefore, ought to prevail in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1805569/\" id=\"a_1408\">Section\n\n71</a> of the 2002 Act. Further, in view of the inbuilt safeguards and\n\nstringent stipulations to be adhered to by the Authorities under the\n\n2002 Act, it ought to be regarded as reasonable provision having\n\nnexus with the purposes and objects sought to be achieved by the\n\n2002 Act.

Suffice it to observe that\n\neven under <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_1426\">Section 18</a> of the 2002 Act, the Authority authorised to\n\nexercise power of search of person is obliged to adhere to identical\n\ninbuilt safeguards as in the case of exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/1534088/\" id=\"a_1427\">Section\n\n17</a> of the 2002 Act. In addition to the similar safeguards in terms of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_1428\">Section 18(3)</a> of the 2002 Act, the Authority is obliged to take the\n\nperson who is about to be searched to a Gazetted Officer or a\n\nMagistrate before the search of such person is carried out.                 The\n\nConstitution Bench of this Court while dealing with similar\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1429\">NDPS Act</a> in <a href=\"/doc/1438183/\" id=\"a_1430\">State of Punjab vs. Baldev Singh529</a>\n\nupheld the search of person procedure being a fair and reasonable\n\n\n\n\n529   (1999) 6 SCC 172 (also at Footnote No.418)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_710\">\f                                      357</span>\n\nprocedure. In paragraph 25 of <a href=\"/doc/1438183/\" id=\"a_1431\">the said decision</a>, this Court observed\n\nas follows:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_227\">         “25. To be searched before a gazetted officer or a\n         Magistrate, if the suspect so requires, is an extremely\n         valuable right which the legislature has given to the\n         person concerned having regard to the grave\n         consequences that may entail the possession of illicit\n         articles under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1432\">NDPS Act</a>. It appears to have been\n         incorporated in the Act keeping in view the severity of the\n         punishment. The rationale behind the provision is even\n         otherwise manifest. The search before a gazetted officer\n         or a Magistrate would impart much more authenticity\n         and creditworthiness to the search and seizure\n         proceeding. It would also verily strengthen the\n         prosecution case. There is, thus, no justification for the\n         empowered officer, who goes to search the person, on\n         prior information, to effect the search, of not informing\n         the person concerned of the existence of his right to have\n         his search conducted before a gazetted officer or a\n         Magistrate, so as to enable him to avail of that right. It is,\n         however, not necessary to give the information to the\n         person to be searched about his right in writing. It is\n         sufficient if such information is communicated to the\n         person concerned orally and as far as possible in the\n         presence of some independent and respectable persons\n         witnessing the arrest and search. The prosecution must,\n         however, at the trial, establish that the empowered officer\n         had conveyed the information to the person concerned of\n         his right of being searched in the presence of a Magistrate\n         or a gazetted officer, at the time of the intended search.\n         Courts have to be satisfied at the trial of the case about\n         due compliance with the requirements provided in\n         <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_1433\">Section 50</a>. No presumption under <a href=\"/doc/1297682/\" id=\"a_1434\">Section 54</a> of the Act\n         can be raised against an accused, unless the prosecution\n         establishes it to the satisfaction of the court, that the\n         requirements of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_1435\">Section 50</a> were duly complied with.”\n\n\n\nAdditionally, under <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_1436\">Section 18(5)</a> of the 2002 Act, if the person to be\n\nsearched is taken to a Gazetted Officer or the Magistrate, then such\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_711\">\f                                    358</span>\n\nOfficer or Magistrate may release the person if there is no ground for\n\nsearch and under <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_1437\">Section 18(6)</a>, the Authority is obliged to call at\n\nleast two witnesses to attend to witness the search, in whose\n\npresence, the search is to be carried out. In terms of <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_1438\">Section 18(7)</a>,\n\nthe Authority seizing any property during the search of such a\n\nperson has to prepare a list of the record or the property seized which\n\nis required to be signed by the witnesses to ensure that no tempering\n\nthereof takes place later on. In case, search of a female is to be\n\ncarried out, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_1439\">Section 18(8)</a>, it could be done only by a\n\nfemale. Significantly, the Authority seizing any record or property\n\nduring the search of the person, is obliged to submit an application\n\nto the Adjudicating Authority within thirty days for permitting\n\nretention   of   record   or   property.   On   such   application,   the\n\nAdjudicating Authority gives opportunity of hearing to the person\n\nconcerned as to why record or property should not be retained in\n\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_1440\">Section 18(10)</a>. Such inbuilt safeguards are provided to\n\nsecure the interest of the person being subjected to search, at the\n\nsame time for strengthening the mechanism regarding prevention of\n\nmoney-laundering and attachment of proceeds of crime.            Merely\n\nbecause Section 165 of the 1973 Code provides for a different\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_712\">\f                                  359</span>\n\nmechanism regarding search by the police officer, that will be of no\n\nconsequence    for   dealing   with     the   inquiry/investigation   and\n\nadjudication including prosecution under the 2002 Act. Suffice it to\n\nobserve that the provision in the form of <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_1441\">Section 18</a>, as amended, is\n\na special provision and is certainly not arbitrary much less\n\nmanifestly arbitrary. Instead, we hold that the amended provision\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/325366/\" id=\"a_1442\">Section 18</a> has reasonable nexus with the purposes and objects\n\nsought to be achieved by the 2002 Act of prevention of money-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_228\">laundering and attachment and confiscation of property (proceeds\n\nof crime) involved in money-laundering, as also prosecution against\n\nthe person concerned for offence of money-laundering under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1443\">Section\n\n3</a> of the 2002 Act.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_486\">ARREST\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_487\">88. <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_1444\">Section 19</a> of the 2002 Act postulates the manner in which\n\narrest of person involved in money-laundering can be effected. Sub-\n\nsection (1) of <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_1445\">Section 19</a> envisages that the Director, Deputy\n\nDirector, Assistant Director, or any other officer authorised in this\n\nbehalf by the Central Government, if has material in his possession\n\ngiving rise to reason to believe that any person has been guilty of an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_713\">\f                                   360</span>\n\noffence punishable under the 2002 Act, he may arrest such person.\n\nBesides the power being invested in high-ranking officials, <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_1446\">Section\n\n19</a> provides for inbuilt safeguards to be adhered to by the authorised\n\nofficers, such as of recording reasons for the belief regarding the\n\ninvolvement of person in the offence of money-laundering. That has\n\nto be recorded in writing and while effecting arrest of the person, the\n\ngrounds for such arrest are informed to that person. Further, the\n\nauthorised officer has to forward a copy of the order, along with the\n\nmaterial in his possession, in a sealed cover to the Adjudicating\n\nAuthority, who in turn is obliged to preserve the same for the\n\nprescribed period as per the Rules.       This safeguard is to ensure\n\nfairness, objectivity and accountability of the authorised officer in\n\nforming opinion as recorded in writing regarding the necessity to\n\narrest the person being involved in offence of money-laundering. Not\n\nonly that, it is also the obligation of the authorised officer to produce\n\nthe person so arrested before the Special Court or Judicial\n\nMagistrate or a Metropolitan Magistrate, as the case may be, within\n\ntwenty-four hours.     This production is also to comply with the\n\nrequirement of Section 167 of the 1973 Code. There is nothing in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_1447\">Section 19</a>, which is contrary to the requirement of production under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_714\">\f                                                361</span>\n\nSection 167 of the 1973 Code, but being an express statutory\n\nrequirement under the 2002 Act in terms of <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_1448\">Section 19(3)</a>, it has to\n\nbe complied by the authorised officer. <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_1449\">Section 19</a>, as amended from\n\ntime to time, reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_229\">             “19.

Even, in case of arrest pursuant to the\n\norder of the Court, a formal complaint against such person accusing\n\nhim of being involved in commission of an offence is essential.\n\nMoreover, the person produced before the Court would be at a loss\n\nto know the grounds for arrest unless a formal FIR or complaint is\n\nfiled accusing him about his involvement in the commission of an\n\noffence. The provision if interpreted to permit the authorised officer\n\nto arrest someone being involved in the commission of offence of\n\nmoney-laundering without a formal complaint against him, would\n\nbe ex facie manifestly arbitrary and unconstitutional.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_489\">89. This argument clearly overlooks the overall scheme of the 2002\n\nAct. As noticed earlier, it is a comprehensive legislation, not limited\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_716\">\f                                 363</span>\n\nto provide for prosecution of person involved in the offence of money-\n\nlaundering, but mainly intended to prevent money-laundering\n\nactivity and confiscate the proceeds of crime involved in money-\n\nlaundering. It also provides for prosecuting the person involved in\n\nsuch activity constituting offence of money-laundering.      In other\n\nwords, this legislation is an amalgam of different facets including\n\nsetting up of agencies and mechanisms for coordinating measures\n\nfor combating money-laundering. Chapter III is a provision to\n\neffectuate these purposes and objectives by attachment, adjudication\n\nand confiscation. The adjudication is done by the Adjudicating\n\nAuthority to confirm the order of provisional attachment in respect\n\nof   proceeds   of   crime   involved   in   money-laundering.    For\n\naccomplishing that objective, the authorities appointed under\n\nChapter VIII have been authorised to make inquiry into all matters\n\nby way of survey, searches and seizures of records and property.\n\nThese provisions in no way invest power in the Authorities referred\n\nto in Chapter VIII of the 2002 Act to maintain law and order or for\n\nthat matter, purely investigating into a criminal offence. The inquiry\n\npreceding filing of the complaint by the authorities under the 2002\n\nAct, may have the semblance of an investigation conducted by them.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_717\">\f                                  364</span>\n\nHowever, it is essentially an inquiry to collect evidence to facilitate\n\nthe Adjudicating Authority to decide on the confirmation of\n\nprovisional   attachment    order,      including   to   pass   order   of\n\nconfiscation, as a result of which, the proceeds of crime would vest\n\nin the Central Government in terms of <a href=\"/doc/775154/\" id=\"a_1452\">Section 9</a> of the 2002 Act. In\n\nother words, the role of the Authorities appointed under Chapter VIII\n\nof the 2002 Act is such that they are tasked with dual role of\n\nconducting inquiry and collect evidence to facilitate adjudication\n\nproceedings before the Adjudicating Authority in exercise of powers\n\nconferred upon them under Chapters III and V of the 2002 Act and\n\nalso to use the same materials to bolster the allegation against the\n\nperson concerned by way of a formal complaint to be filed for offence\n\nof money-laundering under the 2002 Act before the Special Court, if\n\nthe fact situation so warrant.       It is not as if after every inquiry\n\nprosecution is launched against all persons found to be involved in\n\nthe commission of offence of money-laundering.            It is also not\n\nunusual to provide for arrest of a person during such inquiry before\n\nfiling of a complaint for indulging in alleged criminal activity. The\n\nrespondent has rightly adverted to somewhat similar provisions in\n\nother legislations, such as <a href=\"/doc/852142/\" id=\"a_1453\">Section 35</a> of FERA and Section 102 of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_718\">\f                                    365</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_1454\">Customs Act</a> including the decisions of this Court upholding such\n\npower of arrest at the inquiry stage bestowed in the Authorities in\n\nthe respective legislations.      In Romesh Chandra Mehta532, the\n\nConstitution Bench of this Court enunciated that <a href=\"/doc/1771476/\" id=\"a_1455\">Section 104</a> of the\n\nCustoms Act confers power to arrest upon the Custom Officer if he\n\nhas reason to believe that any person in India or within the Indian\n\nCustoms waters has been guilty of an offence punishable under\n\nSection 135 of that Act.         Again, in the case of Padam Narain\n\nAggarwal533, while dealing with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_1456\">Customs Act</a>,\n\nit noted that the term “arrest” has neither been defined in the 1973\n\nCode nor in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_1457\">Indian Penal Code</a>, 1860 nor in any other enactment\n\ndealing with offences. This word has been derived from the French\n\nword “arrater” meaning “to stop or stay”. It signifies a restraint of a\n\nperson.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_719\">It is, thus, obliging the person to be obedient to law.\n\nFurther, arrest may be defined as “the execution of the command of\n\na court of law or of a duly authorised officer”. Even, this decision\n\nrecognises the power of the authorised officer to cause arrest during\n\nthe inquiry to be conducted under the concerned legislations. While\n\n\n\n532   Supra at <a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_1458\">Footnote No.119</a>\n533   Supra at Footnote No.246\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_720\">\f                                               366</span>\n\nadverting to the safeguards provided under that legislation before\n\neffecting such arrest, the Court noted as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_233\">               “Safeguards against abuse of power\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_234\">               36. From the above discussion, it is amply clear that\n               power to arrest a person by a Customs Officer is\n               statutory in character and cannot be interfered with.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_490\">               Such power of arrest can be exercised only in those\n               cases where the Customs Officer has “reason to\n               believe” that a person has been guilty of an offence\n               punishable under Sections 132, 133, 135, 135-A or\n               136 of the Act. Thus, the power must be exercised on\n               objective facts of commission of an offence\n               enumerated and the Customs Officer has reason to\n               believe that a person sought to be arrested has been\n               guilty of commission of such offence. The power to\n               arrest   thus    is   circumscribed   by    objective\n               considerations and cannot be exercised on whims,\n               caprice or fancy of the officer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_491\">               37. The section534 also obliges the Customs Officer to\n               inform the person arrested of the grounds of arrest as\n               soon as may be. The law requires such person to be\n               produced before a Magistrate without unnecessary\n               delay.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_492\">               38. The law thus, on the one hand, allows a Customs\n               Officer to exercise power to arrest a person who has\n               committed certain offences, and on the other hand,\n               takes due care to ensure individual freedom and\n               liberty by laying down norms and providing\n               safeguards so that the power of arrest is not abused\n               or misused by the authorities. ….”\n                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\nThe safeguards provided in the 2002 Act and the preconditions to be\n\nfulfilled by the authorised officer before effecting arrest, as contained\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_1459\">Section 19</a> of the 2002 Act, are equally stringent and of higher\n\n\n534   Ed.: <a href=\"/doc/1771476/\" id=\"a_1460\">Section 104</a> of the Customs Act, 1962.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_721\">\f                                  367</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_493\">\n\nstandard. Those safeguards ensure that the authorised officers do\n\nnot act arbitrarily, but make them accountable for their judgment\n\nabout the necessity to arrest any person as being involved in the\n\ncommission of offence of money-laundering even before filing of the\n\ncomplaint before the Special Court under <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_1461\">Section 44(1)(b)</a> of the\n\n2002 Act in that regard. If the action of the authorised officer is\n\nfound to be vexatious, he can be proceeded with and inflicted with\n\npunishment specified under <a href=\"/doc/1790095/\" id=\"a_1462\">Section 62</a> of the 2002 Act.              The\n\nsafeguards to be adhered to by the jurisdictional police officer before\n\neffecting arrest as stipulated in the 1973 Code, are certainly not\n\ncomparable. Suffice it to observe that this power has been given to\n\nthe high-ranking officials with further conditions to ensure that\n\nthere is objectivity and their own accountability in resorting to arrest\n\nof a person even before a formal complaint is filed under <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_1463\">Section\n\n44(1)(b)</a> of the 2002 Act. Investing of power in the high-ranking\n\nofficials in this regard has stood the test of reasonableness in\n\nPremium Granites535, wherein the Court restated the position that\n\nrequirement of giving reasons for exercise of power by itself excludes\n\n\n\n\n535   Supra at Footnote No.248\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_722\">\f                                         368</span>\n\nchances of arbitrariness. Further, in M/s. Sukhwinder Pal Bipan\n\nKumar536, the Court restated the position that where the discretion\n\nto apply the provisions of a particular statute is left with the\n\nGovernment or one of the highest officers, it will be presumed that\n\nthe discretion vested in such highest authority will not be abused.\n\nAdditionally, the Central Government has framed Rules under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1175622/\" id=\"a_1464\">Section 73</a> in 2005, regarding the forms and the manner of\n\nforwarding a copy of order of arrest of a person along with the\n\nmaterial to the Adjudicating Authority and the period of its retention.\n\nIn yet another decision in Ahmed Noormohmed Bhatti537, this\n\nCourt opined that the provision cannot be held to be unreasonable\n\nor arbitrary and, therefore, unconstitutional merely because the\n\nauthority vested with the power may abuse his authority. (Also see\n\nManzoor Ali Khan538).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_494\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_495\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_723\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_724\">90.

On the other hand, we hold that such a provision\n\nhas reasonable nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be\n\nachieved by the 2002 Act of prevention of money-laundering and\n\nconfiscation of proceeds of crime involved in money-laundering,\n\nincluding to prosecute persons involved in the process or activity\n\nconnected with the proceeds of crime so as to ensure that the\n\nproceeds of crime are not dealt with in any manner which may result\n\nin frustrating any proceedings relating to confiscation thereof.\n\n\n\nBURDEN OF PROOF</span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_496\">91.

This provision (<a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_1479\">Section 24</a>) must,\n\nhowever, apply to proceeding before the Adjudicating Authority\n\nregarding confirmation of provisional attachment order and\n\neventually for ordering confiscation of the attached property for\n\nvesting in the Central Government under <a href=\"/doc/775154/\" id=\"a_1480\">Section 9</a> of the 2002 Act.\n\nThis is reinforced from the purport of <a href=\"/doc/654722/\" id=\"a_1481\">Section 23</a> of the 2002 Act.\n\nFurther, it would also apply to proceeding before the Special Court\n\nempowered to try the offence of money-laundering under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1482\">Section 3</a>\n\nof the 2002 Act upon presentation of a complaint by the authority\n\nauthorised as per <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_1483\">Section 44(1)(b)</a> of the 2002 Act.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_729\">\f                                             373</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_499\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"132042\" id=\"span_730\">92. It is, thus, clear that this special provision regarding burden of\n\nproof in any proceeding relating to proceeds of crime under this Act\n\nwould apply to stated proceeding before the Adjudicating Authority\n\nand not limited to the proceeding before the Special Court. That is\n\nevident from the plain language, indicative of applicability of the\n\nprovision to “any” proceeding before the “Authority” or the “Court”.\n\nThe expression “Authority” occurring in this provision must be given\n\nits proper meaning indicative of the Adjudicating Authority\n\nappointed under <a href=\"/doc/719602/\" id=\"a_1484\">Section 6</a> of the 2002 Act to adjudicate on matters\n\nconcerning confirmation of provisional attachment order and\n\neventual confiscation and vesting of the property, if the fact situation\n\nso warrant. It is an independent body, free from the control of the\n\nExecutive540. It is ordained to deal with civil aspects of the action of\n\nattachment and confiscation of the proceeds of crime and not about\n\nthe criminality of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1485\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act. When\n\nthis provision is made applicable to the proceeding before the\n\nAuthority, it would not be necessary to follow the strict principle of\n\nstandard of proof beyond reasonable doubt, as applicable in criminal\n\n\n\n540   See <a href=\"/doc/132042/\" id=\"a_1486\">Pareena Swarup</a> (supra at Footnote No.366)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_731\">\f                                 374</span>\n\ntrials. That principle will have no bearing on the proceeding before\n\nthe Authority. However, when the same evidence and provision is\n\nrelied upon in the proceeding before the Special Court regarding trial\n\nof offence of money-laundering under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1487\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act, it\n\nwould have a different connotation in the context of a criminal trial.</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_500\">93. Be that as it may, this <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_1488\">Section 24</a> deals with two situations.\n\nThe first part concerns the person charged with the offence of\n\nmoney-laundering under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1489\">Section 3</a>. The second part [Clause (b)]\n\nconcerns any other person. Taking the second part first, such other\n\nperson would obviously mean a person not charged with the offence\n\nof money-laundering under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1490\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act. The two parts,\n\nin one sense, are mutually exclusive. If a person is charged with the\n\noffence of money-laundering under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1491\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act owing\n\nto a complaint filed by the authority authorised before the Special\n\nCourt, Clause (a) would trigger in. As regards the second category\n\n[Clause (b)] of person, the expression used is “may presume”.\n\nWhereas, qua the first category [covered under Clause (a)] the\n\nexpression used is “shall, unless the contrary is proved, presume”.\n\nIn this category, if a charge is already framed against the person for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_732\">\f                                   375</span>\n\nhaving committed offence of money-laundering, it would presuppose\n\nthat the Court framing charge against him was prima facie convinced\n\nthat the materials placed before it had disclosed grave suspicion\n\nagainst such person. In such a case, once the issue of admissibility\n\nof materials supporting the factum of grave suspicion about the\n\ninvolvement of the person in the commission of crime under the\n\n2002 Act, is accepted, in law, the burden must shift on the person\n\nconcerned to dispel that suspicion. It would then not be a case of\n\nreversal of burden of proof as such, but one of shifting of burden on\n\nhim to show that no offence of money-laundering had been\n\ncommitted and, in any case, the property (proceeds of crime) was not\n\ninvolved in money-laundering.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_501\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_502\">94. Before we proceed to analyse the efficacy of <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_1492\">Section 24</a> of the\n\n2002 Act, it may be appropriate to visit the definition of expressions\n\nin the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_1493\">Evidence Act</a>, relevant to answer the issue of standard of proof\n\nin any proceeding. In the interpretation clause, <a href=\"/doc/1031309/\" id=\"a_1494\">Section 3</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act, expression “fact” has been defined as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_243\">         “3.

In civil actions, it can be preponderance of\n\nprobability but in criminal actions, unless the law provides to the\n\ncontrary, the onus is on the prosecution to establish the allegations\n\nand facts in issue beyond reasonable doubt.                 Furthermore, the\n\nburden or onus of establishing the facts in issue, keeps on shifting\n\nand is on the party who asserts a particular fact.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_735\">\f                                              378</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_509\">95. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"496676\" id=\"span_736\">Indeed, in a criminal trial, the principle of innocence of the\n\naccused/offender is regarded as a human right — as held by this\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/496676/\" id=\"a_1495\">Narendra Singh &amp; Anr. vs. State of M.P.542</a>.

The question whether the burden on the\n\naccused is a legal burden or an evidentiary burden, would depend\n\non the statute and its purport and object. Indeed, it must pass the\n\ntest of the doctrine of proportionality. In any case, as the burden on\n\nthe accused would be only an evidentiary burden, it can be\n\ndischarged by the accused by producing evidence regarding the facts\n\nwithin his personal knowledge. Again, in the case of Seema Silk &amp;\n\nSarees553, this Court restated that a legal provision does not become\n\nunconstitutional only because it provides for reverse burden as it is\n\nonly a rule of evidence.

Further,\n\nkeeping in mind the legislative scheme and the purposes and objects\n\nsought to be achieved by the 2002 Act coupled with the fact that the\n\nperson charged or any other person involved in money-laundering,\n\nwould get opportunity to disclose information and evidence to rebut\n\nthe legal presumption in respect of facts within his personal\n\nknowledge during the proceeding before the Authority or the Special\n\nCourt, by no stretch of imagination, provision in the form of <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_1527\">Section\n\n24</a> of the 2002 Act, can be regarded as unconstitutional.

Be that as it may, we may now proceed to decipher the purport\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_1528\">Section 24</a> of the 2002 Act. In the first place, it must be noticed\n\nthat the legal presumption in either case is about the involvement of\n\nproceeds of crime in money-laundering. This fact becomes relevant,\n\nonly if, the prosecution or the authorities have succeeded in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_745\">\f                                  384</span>\n\nestablishing at least three basic or foundational facts. First, that the\n\ncriminal activity relating to a scheduled offence has been committed.\n\nSecond, that the property in question has been derived or obtained,\n\ndirectly or indirectly, by any person as a result of that criminal\n\nactivity.   Third, the person concerned is, directly or indirectly,\n\ninvolved in any process or activity connected with the said property\n\nbeing proceeds of crime. On establishing the fact that there existed\n\nproceeds of crime and the person concerned was involved in any\n\nprocess or activity connected therewith, itself, constitutes offence of\n\nmoney-laundering. The nature of process or activity has now been\n\nelaborated in the form of Explanation inserted vide <a href=\"/doc/105739094/\" id=\"a_1529\">Finance (No.2)\n\nAct, 2019</a>. On establishing these foundational facts in terms of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_1530\">Section 24</a> of the 2002 Act, a legal presumption would arise that\n\nsuch proceeds of crime are involved in money-laundering. The fact\n\nthat the person concerned had no causal connection with such\n\nproceeds of crime and he is able to disprove the fact about his\n\ninvolvement in any process or activity connected therewith, by\n\nproducing evidence in that regard, the legal presumption would\n\nstand rebutted.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_746\">\f                                        385</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_518\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_519\">98. The person falling under the first category being person\n\ncharged with the offence of money-laundering, presupposes that a\n\nformal complaint has already been filed against him by the authority\n\nauthorised naming him as an accused in the commission of offence\n\nof money-laundering.             As observed in P.N. Krishna Lal554, the\n\nCourt cannot be oblivious about the purpose of the law. Further,\n\nthe special provisions or the special enactments as in this case is\n\nrequired to tackle new situations created by human proclivity to\n\namass wealth at the altar of formal financial system of the country\n\nincluding its sovereignty and integrity.         While dealing with such\n\nprovision, reading it down would also defeat the legislative intent.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_520\">99. Be it noted that the legal presumption under <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_1531\">Section 24(a)</a> of\n\nthe 2002 Act, would apply when the person is charged with the\n\noffence of money-laundering and his direct or indirect involvement\n\nin any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime, is\n\nestablished.         The existence of proceeds of crime is, therefore, a\n\nfoundational fact, to be established by the prosecution, including the\n\ninvolvement of the person in any process or activity connected\n\n\n\n554   Supra at Footnote No.382\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_747\">\f                                             386</span>\n\ntherewith.        Once these foundational facts are established by the\n\nprosecution, the onus must then shift on the person facing charge\n\nof offence of money-laundering — to rebut the legal presumption\n\nthat the proceeds of crime are not involved in money-laundering, by\n\nproducing evidence which is within his personal knowledge. In other\n\nwords, the expression “presume” is not conclusive. It also does not\n\nfollow that the legal presumption that the proceeds of crime are\n\ninvolved in money-laundering is to be invoked by the Authority or\n\nthe Court, without providing an opportunity to the person to rebut\n\nthe same by leading evidence within his personal knowledge555.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_521\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"907725\" id=\"span_748\">100. Such onus also flows from the purport of <a href=\"/doc/697566/\" id=\"a_1532\">Section 106</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act. Whereby, he must rebut the legal presumption in the\n\nmanner he chooses to do and as is permissible in law, including by\n\nreplying under Section 313 of the 1973 Code or even by cross-\n\nexamining prosecution witnesses.                   The person would get enough\n\nopportunity in the proceeding before the Authority or the Court, as\n\nthe case may be. He may be able to discharge his burden by showing\n\nthat he is not involved in any process or activity connected with the\n\n\n555   See <a href=\"/doc/907725/\" id=\"a_1533\">Sarbananda Sonowal</a> (supra at Footnote No.389)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_749\">\f                                               387</span>\n\nproceeds of crime. In any case, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_1534\">Section 114556</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act, it is open to the Court to presume the existence of any\n\nfact which it thinks likely to have happened, regard being had to the\n\ncommon course of natural events, human conduct, and public and\n\nprivate business, in their relation to the facts of the particular case.\n\nConsidering the above, the provision under consideration [<a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_1535\">Section\n\n24(a)</a>] by no standards can be said to be unreasonable much less\n\nmanifestly arbitrary and unconstitutional.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_522\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_523\">101. Reverting to <a href=\"/doc/1373137/\" id=\"a_1536\">Section 24(b)</a> of the 2002 Act, that concerns\n\nperson other than the person charged with the offence of money-\n\nlaundering under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1537\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act.                          In his case, the\n\nexpression used in Clause (b) is “may presume”. This is essentially\n\na factual presumption or discretionary presumption as expounded\n\nby this Court in A. Vaidyanatha Iyer557. In paragraph 14 of the\n\ndecision, the Court noted the marked distinction between the words\n\n“shall presume” and “may presume” as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_253\">               “(14). …… Therefore where it is proved that a gratification\n               has been accepted, then the presumption shall at once\n\n556 114.

It introduces an exception to the\n               general rule as to the burden of proof in criminal cases\n               and shifts the onus on to the accused. It may here be\n               mentioned that the legislature has chosen to use the\n               words ‘shall presume’ and not ‘may presume’, the\n               former a presumption of law and latter of fact.

In case\n\nthe scheduled offence is triable by Special Court under the special\n\nenactment elsewhere, the provision, as amended, makes it amply\n\nclear that both the trials after coming into effect of this Act need to\n\nproceed independently, but in the area where the offence of money-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_270\">laundering has been committed.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_271\">565Subs. by Act 2 of 2013, <a href=\"/doc/1566465/\" id=\"a_1580\">sec. 21(i)</a>, for clause (a) (w.e.f. 15-2-2013, vide S.O. 343(E), dated 8-\n2-2013).\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_758\">\f                                 395</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_272\">105.

The proviso in Clause (a) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_1582\">Section 44</a>, is in\n\nthe nature of an exception.            It predicates that before the\n\ncommencement of this Act, if the Special Court elsewhere was\n\nalready trying the scheduled offence, shall continue to try the same.\n\nPrima facie, it is possible to take the view that the effect of this\n\nproviso, which has come in 2013, may have retrospective effect.\n\nHowever, no specific case has been brought to our notice wherein\n\nthe effect of such amendment is required to be examined.\n\nAccordingly, it is not necessary to dilate on this aspect any further.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_539\">107. This stipulation, however, will have to be regarded as directory\n\nprovision. We say so because in a given case, the offence of money-\n\nlaundering may have been committed at place x, which may be in\n\none State, but the property which is subject matter of money-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_759\">\f                                   396</span>\n\nlaundering may have been derived or obtained, directly or indirectly,\n\nas a result of criminal activity relating to a scheduled offence\n\ncommitted at more than one place including in multiple States\n\nthroughout the country. In such a case, it will not be open to the\n\nSpecial Court at place x to transfer all other cases in the area (even\n\noutside the State). If the provision is to be interpreted otherwise, it\n\nwould have serious consequences on the trials which are pending in\n\nconnection with the scheduled offences including before the Special\n\nCourt elsewhere. This provision, therefore, needs to be read down\n\nto mean that as far as possible, the trial of scheduled offence before\n\nthe Special Court under the concerned law, if in different area, that\n\nSpecial Court may continue to try such scheduled offence. For, the\n\ntrial of the scheduled offence and the trial in connection with the\n\nmoney-laundering are in any way required to proceed independently.\n\nThat is because, the offence of money-laundering by itself is an\n\nindependent offence in respect of the process and activity connected\n\nwith the proceeds of crime which may have been derived or obtained,\n\ndirectly or indirectly, by any person as a result of criminal activity\n\nrelating to a scheduled offence.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_760\">\f                                                 397</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_540\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_541\">108.

It\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_762\">\f                                   399</span>\n\npermits the Authority authorised to file a closure report before the\n\nSpecial Court in case it is of the opinion that no offence of money-\n\nlaundering has been made out, requiring filing of such complaint.\n\nThis provision is only to dispel the doubt that in the event the person\n\nhas been arrested by the officer authorised under <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_1596\">Section 19</a> of this\n\nAct on the basis of material in his possession and having reason to\n\nbelieve and recorded in writing of being guilty of an offence\n\npunishable under this Act, but after the inquiry done by him in\n\nexercise of powers under Chapters V and VIII of the 2002 Act, he\n\nforms an opinion that no offence of money-laundering is made out,\n\nrequiring filing of complaint, it is open to him to file a closure report\n\nbefore the Special Court disclosing that position. The proviso would,\n\nthus, come into play in such cases where the complaint is yet to be\n\nfiled owing to the pendency of inquiry before the authorities, under\n\nChapters V and VIII of the 2002 Act. In that view of the matter and\n\nmore so keeping in mind the purposes and objects behind the\n\nenactment of 2002 Act, such a provision must be regarded as having\n\nreasonable nexus with the purposes and objects sought to be\n\nachieved by the 2002 Act. Accordingly, for the view taken by us, we do\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_763\">\f                                                  400</span>\n\nnot find any dichotomy in these provisions, much less being\n\nmanifestly arbitrary or unconstitutional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_545\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_546\">110.

That provision has already been elaborated in the earlier\n\npart of this judgment and read down to mean that it is an enabling\n\nand discretionary provision. The same consideration must be kept\n\nin mind by the Special Court while considering the application filed\n\nin terms of this clause. For, this clause also recognises that the trial\n\n\n\n569   Ins. by Act 2 of 2013, <a href=\"/doc/1566465/\" id=\"a_1600\">sec. 21(iii)</a> (w.e.f. 15-2-2013, vide S.O. 343(E), dated 8-2-2013)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_764\">\f                                  401</span>\n\nof scheduled offence and the trial concerning offence of money-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_547\">laundering need to proceed independently, even though it may be\n\ntried by the same Special Court as both are distinct and independent\n\noffences.

In the context of this provision, it was emphatically argued\n\nbefore us by the petitioners that it would take away one right of\n\nappeal, otherwise available under the 1973 Code.          Resultantly,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_1601\">Section 44(1)(c)</a> of the 2002 Act in particular, is unconstitutional. To\n\nbuttress this submission, reliance has been placed on the dictum in\n\nA.R. Antulay570. However, this ground need not detain us in view\n\nof the just stand taken by the learned Additional Solicitor General\n\nappearing for Union of India relying on the decision of this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/76812356/\" id=\"a_1602\">State (Through Central Bureau of Investigation) vs. Kalyan\n\nSingh (Former Chief Minister of Uttar Pradesh) &amp; Ors.571</a>, which\n\n\n\n\n570   Supra at Footnote No.134\n571   (2017) 7 SCC 444\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_766\">\f                                        402</span>\n\nhas considered similar challenge.                 The latter decision has\n\ndistinguished the exposition in A.R. Antulay572. In that, the core\n\nissue considered in A.R. Antulay573 was whether the High Court\n\nwas competent to transfer the criminal trial pending before the\n\nSpecial Court dealing with the offence of <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_1603\">PC Act</a>, to itself by invoking\n\npowers under Section 407 of the 1973 Code. The Court answered\n\nthe same in the negative and held that such power does not exist in\n\nthe High Court and it would inevitably violate <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1604\">Article 21</a> of the\n\nConstitution.          However, we are dealing with the dispensation\n\nprovided by the law made by the Parliament in the form of 2002 Act.\n\nThis being a special legislation and keeping in view the purport of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/72194817/\" id=\"a_1605\">Sections 65</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1805569/\" id=\"a_1606\">71</a> of the 2002 Act, it is not possible to countenance\n\nthe ground of challenge under consideration.

In the present case, the power of transfer is being\n              exercised to transfer a case from one Special Judge to\n              another Special Judge, and not to the High Court. The\n              fact that one Special Judge happens to be a\n              Magistrate, whereas the other Special Judge has\n              committed the case to a Court of Session would not\n              make any difference as, as has been stated\n              hereinabove, even a right of appeal from a Magistrate\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_550\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_767\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_768\">572   Supra at <a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_1607\">Footnote No.134</a>\n573   Supra at <a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_1608\">Footnote No.134</a>\n574   Supra at Footnote No.571\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_769\">\f                                           403</span>\n\n              to the Sessions Court, and from the Sessions Court to\n              the High Court could be taken away under the\n              procedure established by law i.e. by virtue of Sections\n              407(1) and (8) if the case is required to be transferred\n              from the Magistrate at Rae Bareilly to the High Court\n              itself.

Reverting to Clause (d) of sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_1615\">Section 44</a>, it\n\npostulates that a Special Court while trying the scheduled offence or\n\noffence of money-laundering shall hold trial in accordance with the\n\nprovisions of the 1973 Code as it applies to a trial before a Court of\n\nSessions. Going by the plain language of this provision, no fault can\n\nbe found for conducting trial in the respective cases in the same\n\n\n\n\n575   Supra at Footnote No.134\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_770\">\f                                    404</span>\n\nmanner as provided in the 1973 Code. However, the grievance is\n\nabout the insertion of Explanation vide <a href=\"/doc/105739094/\" id=\"a_1616\">Finance (No.2) Act, 2019</a>. As\n\na matter of fact, this insertion is only a clarificatory provision, as is\n\nevident from the opening statement of the provision which says that\n\n“for the removal of doubts, it is clarified that”. None of the clauses\n\ninserted by this amendment travel beyond the principal provision\n\ncontained in Clause (d). Clause (i) of the Explanation enunciates\n\nthat the jurisdiction of the Special Court while dealing with the\n\noffence being tried under this Act, shall not be dependent upon any\n\norders passed in respect of the scheduled offence, and the trial of\n\nboth sets of offences by the same Court shall not be construed as\n\njoint trials. This, in fact, is reiteration of the earlier part of the same\n\nsection, which envisages that even though both the trials may\n\nproceed before the same Special Court, it must be tried separately\n\nas per the provisions of the 1973 Code. Insofar as Clause (ii) of the\n\nExplanation, at the first glance, it does give an impression that the\n\nsame is unconnected with the earlier part of the section. However,\n\non closer scrutiny of this provision, it is noted that the same is only\n\nan enabling provision permitting to take on record material\n\nregarding further investigation against any accused person involved\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_771\">\f                                 405</span>\n\nin respect of offence of money-laundering for which complaint has\n\nalready been filed, whether he has been named in the complaint or\n\nnot. Such a provision, in fact, is a wholesome provision to ensure\n\nthat no person involved in the commission of offence of money-\n\nlaundering must go unpunished. It is always open to the Authority\n\nauthorised to seek permission of the Court during the trial of the\n\ncomplaint in respect of which cognizance has already been taken by\n\nthe Court to bring on record further evidence which request can be\n\ndealt with by the Special Court in accordance with law keeping in\n\nmind the provisions of the 1973 Code as well. It is also open to the\n\nAuthority authorised to file a fresh complaint against the person who\n\nhas not been named as accused in the complaint already filed in\n\nrespect of same offence of money-laundering, including to request\n\nthe Court to proceed against such other person appearing to be\n\nguilty of offence under Section 319 of the 1973 Code, which\n\notherwise would apply to such a trial.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_553\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_554\">113. The petitioners may be justified in making grievance that the\n\nprovision though permits the Special Court to proceed with the trial\n\nin respect of scheduled offence, yet it may be oppressive as against\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_772\">\f                                  406</span>\n\nthe accused who is not charged with the offence of money-\n\nlaundering but only scheduled offence. For, he may be denied of\n\nopportunity of one appeal or revision, as the case may be before the\n\nhigher forum. Such a grievance can certainly be looked into by the\n\nSpecial Court if an application is moved by the Authority authorised.\n\nSince we have held that the provision is only to bestow enabling\n\npower in the Special Court, it must follow that the Special Court will\n\nexamine the request of the Authority authorised for transfer of trial\n\nof predicate offence to itself on case-to-case basis. Similarly, request\n\nfor trial of offence under another special statute, such as <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1617\">PC Act,\n\nNDPS Act</a>, etc. can also be considered by the Special Court on case-\n\nto-case basis after examining all aspects of the matter.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_555\">114. In view of the above discussion, we do not find merit in the\n\nchallenge to <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_1618\">Section 44</a> being arbitrary or unconstitutional. We hold\n\nthat the same is consistent with the legislative scheme and the\n\npurposes and objects behind the enactment of the 2002 Act to\n\nensure that the proceeds of crime involved in money-laundering are\n\ndealt with appropriately as per the special Act and all concerned\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_773\">\f                                              407</span>\n\ninvolved in the process or activity connected with such proceeds of\n\ncrime are prosecuted for offence of money-laundering.\n\n\n\nBAIL\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_556\">115.

The first issue to be answered by us is: whether the twin\n\nconditions, in law, continued to remain on the statute book post\n\ndecision of this Court in Nikesh Tarachand Shah584 and if yes, in\n\nview of the amendment effected to <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1640\">Section 45(1)</a> of the 2002 Act vide\n\nAct 13 of 2018, the declaration by this Court will be of no\n\nconsequence. This argument need not detain us for long. We say\n\nso because the observation in State of Manipur585 in paragraph 29\n\nof the judgment that owing to the declaration by a Court that the\n\nstatute is unconstitutional obliterates the statute entirely as though\n\nit had never been passed, is contextual. In this case, the Court was\n\ndealing with the efficacy of the repealing Act. While doing so, the\n\nCourt had adverted to the repealing Act and made the stated\n\nobservation in the context of lack of legislative power. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_777\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_778\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1683423\" id=\"span_779\">In the process\n\nof reasoning, it did advert to the exposition in <a href=\"/doc/1683423/\" id=\"a_1641\">Behram Khurshid</a>\n\n\n\n\n583   Supra at <a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_1642\">Footnote No.159</a>\n584   Supra at <a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_1643\">Footnote No.3</a>\n585   Supra at Footnote No.159\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_780\">\f                                               411</span>\n\nPesikaka586 and Deep Chand587 including American jurisprudence\n\nexpounded in Cooley on Constitutional Limitations588 and\n\nNorton vs. Shelby County589.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_566\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_567\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_781\">117. In the present case, however, there is no issue of lack of\n\nlegislative power of the Parliament to enact a law on the subject of\n\nmoney-laundering.                In such a situation, the enunciation of the\n\nConstitution Bench of this Court, including seven-Judge Bench,\n\nmay have direct bearing for answering the argument under\n\nconsideration.            We may usefully refer to the dictum of the\n\nConstitution Bench of five-Judges of this Court in M.P.V.\n\nSundararamier &amp; Co.590. It had noted the distinction between the\n\neffect of unconstitutionality of a statute arising either because the\n\nlaw is in respect of a matter not within the competence of the\n\nLegislature, or because the matter itself being within its competence,\n\nits provisions offend some constitutional restrictions. It went on to\n\nobserve that if a law is on a field not within the domain of the\n\n\n586   Supra at <a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_1644\">Footnote No.310</a>\n587   Supra at Footnote No. 210 (also at Footnote No.69)\n588   Vol.1, page 382\n589   118 US 425 (1886)\n590   Supra at Footnote No.311\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_782\">\f                                     412</span>\n\nLegislature, it is absolutely null and void, and a subsequent cession\n\nof that field to or by the Legislature will not have the effect of\n\nbreathing life into what was a still born piece of legislation. At the\n\nsame time, it noted that if the law is in respect of a matter assigned\n\nto the Legislature but its provisions disregard constitutional\n\nprohibitions, though the law would be unenforceable by reason of\n\nthose prohibitions, when once they are removed, the law will become\n\neffective without re-enactment.            After discussing the American\n\ndecisions and jurisprudence, it went on to sum up as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_294\">         “The result of the authorities may thus be summed\n         up: Where an enactment is unconstitutional in part\n         but valid as to the rest, assuming of course that the\n         two portions are severable, it cannot be held to have\n         been wiped out of the statute book as it admittedly\n         must remain there for the purpose of enforcement of\n         the valid portion thereof, and being on the statute\n         book, even that portion which is unenforceable on the\n         ground that it is unconstitutional will operate Proprio\n         vigore when the Constitutional bar is removed, and\n         there is no need for a fresh legislation to give effect\n         thereto. On this view, the contention of the petitioners\n         with reference to the Explanation in s. 22 of the Madras\n         Act must fail. That Explanation operates, as already\n         stated, on two classes of transactions. It renders taxation\n         of sales in which the property in the goods passes in\n         Madras but delivery takes place outside Madras illegal on\n         the ground that they are outside sales falling within <a href=\"/doc/560327/\" id=\"a_1645\">Art.\n         286(1)(a).</a> It also authorises the imposition of tax on the\n         sales in which the property in the goods passes outside\n         Madras but goods are delivered for consumption within\n         Madras. It is valid in so far as it prohibits tax on outside\n         sales, but invalid in so far as sales in which goods are\n         delivered inside the State are concerned, because such\n         sales are hit by <a href=\"/doc/471187/\" id=\"a_1646\">Art. 286(2).</a> The fact that it is invalid as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_783\">\f                                               413</span>\n\n               to a part has not the effect of obliterating it out of the\n               statute book, because it is valid as to a part and has to\n               remain in the statute book for being enforced as to that\n               part. The result of the enactment of the impugned Act is\n               to lift the ban under <a href=\"/doc/471187/\" id=\"a_1647\">Article 286(2)</a>, and the consequence\n               of it is that that portion of the Explanation which relates\n               to sales in which property passes outside Madras but the\n               goods are delivered inside Madras and which was\n               unenforceable before, became valid and enforceable. In\n               this view, we do not feel called upon to express any\n               opinion as to whether it would make any difference in the\n               result if the impugned provision was unconstitutional in\n               its entirety.”\n                                                      (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_295\">118.

After having analysed all the relevant\n\ndecisions, the Court went on to observe in paragraphs 22 and 23, as\n\nfollows:</span></span></span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_296\">           “22. In our view, although decisions of the American\n           Supreme Court and the comments of well known\n           commentators like Willoughby and Cooley have great\n           persuasive force, we need not interpret our\n           Constitution by too much reliance on them. Nor is it\n           necessary to scrutinise too closely the decisions\n           wherein views appear to have been expressed that a\n           law which is void under <a href=\"/doc/772605/\" id=\"a_1655\">Article 13(2)</a> is to be treated\n           as still-born.

Apart from the question as to whether fundamental\n           rights originally enshrined in the Constitution were\n           subject to the amendatory process of <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_1656\">Article 368</a> it must\n           now be held that <a href=\"/doc/282612/\" id=\"a_1657\">Article 31-B</a> and the Ninth Schedule\n           have cured the defect, if any, in the various Acts\n           mentioned in the said Schedule as regards any\n           unconstitutionality alleged on the ground of infringement\n           of fundamental rights, and by the express words of <a href=\"/doc/282612/\" id=\"a_1658\">Article\n           31-B</a> such curing of the defect took place with\n           retrospective operation from the dates on which the Acts\n           were put on the statute book. These Acts even if void\n           or inoperative at the time when they were enacted by\n           reason of infringement of <a href=\"/doc/772605/\" id=\"a_1659\">Article 13(2)</a> of the\n           Constitution, assumed full force and vigour from the\n           respective dates of their enactment after their\n           inclusion in the Ninth Schedule, read with <a href=\"/doc/354224/\" id=\"a_1660\">Article 31-</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_791\">\f                                     415</span>\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_569\">         B of the Constitution. The States could not, at any time,\n         cure any defect arising from the violation of the provisions\n         of Part III of the Constitution and therefore the objection\n         that the Madras Ceilings Act should have been re-enacted\n         by the Madras legislature after the Seventeenth\n         Constitutional Amendment came into force cannot be\n         accepted.”\n                                                (emphasis supplied)\n\n\nThus, where the defect as pointed out by the Court has been\n\nremoved by virtue of the validating Act retrospectively, then the\n\nprovision can be held to be intra vires provided that it does not\n\ntransgress any other constitutional limitation. It is, therefore, clear\n\nfrom above that if by amending the provision retrospectively, the\n\nParliament has removed the defect or has taken away the basis on\n\nwhich the provision was declared void then the provision cannot be\n\nsaid to be in conflict with <a href=\"/doc/134715/\" id=\"a_1661\">Article 13</a> of the Constitution. In other\n\nwords, if the very premise on which the judgment of the Court\n\ndeclaring the provision to be void has been uprooted by the\n\nParliament, thereby resulting in the change of circumstances, the\n\njudgment could not be given effect to in the altered circumstances,\n\nthen the provision cannot be held to be void. In this case, as has\n\nbeen    stated    above,      the     anomalies       noted      in     Nikesh\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_792\">\f                                  416</span>\n\nTarachand Shah598 have been removed by way of Act No. 13 of\n\n2018.

That conclusion reached by this Court is essentially\n\non account of two basic reasons. The first being that the provision,\n\nas it existed at the relevant time, was founded on a classification\n\nbased on sentencing of the scheduled offence and it had no nexus\n\nwith objectives of the 2002 Act; and secondly, because the twin\n\nconditions were restricted only to a particular class of offences\n\nwithin the 2002 Act, such as offences punishable for a term of\n\nimprisonment for more than three years under Part A of the\n\nSchedule, and not to all the offences under the 2002 Act.           In\n\nparagraph 1 of the same decision, the Court had noted that the\n\nchallenge set forth in the writ petition was limited to imposing two\n\nconditions for grant of bail wherein an offence punishable for a term\n\nof imprisonment for more than three years under Part A of the\n\nSchedule to the Act is involved. This aspect has been thoroughly\n\nanalysed by the Court in <a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_1670\">the said decision</a>. The Court also noted the\n\nlegislative history for enacting such a law and other relevant material\n\nfrom paragraph 11 onwards upto paragraph 43.           It adverted to\n\nseveral circumstances and illustrations to conclude that the\n\nprovision, as it stood then, on the face of it, was discriminatory and\n\nmanifestly arbitrary.    Eventually in the operative order, being\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_796\">\f                                 418</span>\n\nparagraph 54 of the decision, the Court declared that <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1671\">Section 45(1)</a>\n\nof the 2002 Act, as it stood then, insofar as it imposes two further\n\nconditions for release on bail, to be unconstitutional as it violated\n\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1672\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1673\">21</a> of the Constitution.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_574\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_575\">121. By the amendment vide Act 13 of 2018, the defects noted by\n\nthis Court in the aforementioned decision have been duly cured by\n\ndeleting the words “punishable for a term of imprisonment of more\n\nthan three years under Part A of the Schedule” in <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1674\">Section 45(1)</a> of\n\nthe 2002 Act and substituted by words “under this Act”.           The\n\nquestion is: whether it was open to the Parliament to undo the effect\n\nof the judgment of this Court declaring the twin conditions\n\nunconstitutional?   On a fair reading of the judgment, we must\n\nobserve that although the Court declared the twin conditions as\n\nunconstitutional, but it was in the context of the opening part of the\n\nsub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1675\">Section 45</a>, as it stood then, which resulted in\n\ndiscrimination and arbitrariness as noticed in the judgment. But\n\nthat opening part referring to class of offences, namely punishable\n\nfor a term of imprisonment of more than three years under Part A of\n\nthe Schedule having been deleted and, instead, the twin conditions\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_797\">\f                                   419</span>\n\nhave now been associated with all the offences under the 2002 Act,\n\nthe defect pointed out in the stated decision, stands cured.       To\n\nanswer the question posed above, we may also usefully refer to the\n\nenunciation of the Constitution Bench of this Court, which\n\nrecognises power of the Legislature to cure the defect when the law\n\nis struck down by the Constitutional Court as violative of some\n\nfundamental rights traceable to Part-III of the Constitution. It has\n\nbeen consistently held that such declaration does not have the effect\n\nof repealing the relevant provision as such. For, the power to repeal\n\nvests only in the Parliament and none else. Only upon such repeal\n\nby the Parliament, the provision would become non est for all\n\npurposes until re-enacted, but it is open to the Parliament to cure\n\nthe defect noticed by the Constitutional Court so that the provision,\n\nas amended by removing such defect gets revived.          This is so\n\nbecause, the declaration by the Constitutional Court and striking\n\ndown of a legal provision being violative of fundamental rights\n\ntraceable to Part III of the Constitution, merely results in the\n\nprovision,   as   it   existed   then,   becoming   inoperative   and\n\nunenforceable, even though it may continue to remain on the statute\n\nbook.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_798\">\f                                         420</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_576\">\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_577\">122. The decision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Shri\n\nPrithvi Cotton Mills Ltd.601 recognises this doctrine of taking away\n\nas the basis or validating acts thereby removing the causes for\n\nineffectiveness or invalidity of actions or proceedings which are\n\nvalidated by a legislative measure and, then by fiction, it becomes\n\nre-enacted law.              We may usefully refer to the decision in\n\nBhubaneshwar Singh602, wherein in paragraph 11, the Court\n\nnoted as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_298\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_799\">“11.

The effect of the amending Act of\n              1969 is not to overrule a judgment passed by a court\n              of law, which the legislature cannot do.

The learned Judges\n               held that the effect of the amending Act is retrospective\n               validation of the assessment orders which were struck\n               down by the High Court.

From the aforesaid authorities, it is settled that\n              there is a demarcation between the legislative and\n              judicial functions predicated on the theory of\n              separation of powers. The legislature has the power to\n              enact laws including the power to retrospectively\n              amend laws and thereby remove causes of\n              ineffectiveness or invalidity. When a law is enacted\n              with retrospective effect, it is not considered as an\n              encroachment upon judicial power when the\n              legislature does not directly overrule or reverse a\n              judicial dictum. The legislature cannot, by way of an\n              enactment, declare a decision of the court as\n              erroneous or a nullity, but can amend the statute or\n              the provision so as to make it applicable to the past.\n              The legislature has the power to rectify, through an\n              amendment, a defect in law noticed in the enactment\n              and even highlighted in the decision of the court.\n              This plenary power to bring the statute in conformity\n              with the legislative intent and correct the flaw\n              pointed out by the court, can have a curative and\n              neutralising effect. When such a correction is made,\n              the purpose behind the same is not to overrule the\n              decision of the court or encroach upon the judicial\n              turf, but simply enact a fresh law with retrospective\n              effect to alter the foundation and meaning of the\n              legislation and to remove the base on which the\n              judgment is founded. This does not amount to\n              statutory overruling by the legislature. In this\n              manner, the earlier decision of the court becomes\n\n615   Supra at Footnote No.307\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_818\">\f                                        427</span>\n\n               non-existent and unenforceable for interpretation of\n               the new legislation. No doubt, the new legislation can\n               be tested and challenged on its own merits and on the\n               question whether the legislature possesses the\n               competence to legislate on the subject-matter in\n               question, but not on the ground of overreach or\n               colourable legislation.”\n                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n\nFrom the above discussion, it is amply clear that the twin conditions\n\ndeclared as unconstitutional by this Court in Nikesh Tarachand\n\nShah616 was in reference to the provision, as it existed at the\n\nrelevant time, predicating application of <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1693\">Section 45</a> of the 2002 Act\n\nto only offences punishable for a term of imprisonment of more than\n\nthree years under Part A of the Schedule of the 2002 Act and not\n\neven linked to the offences of money-laundering under the 2002 Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_586\">The reasons which weighed with this Court for declaring the twin\n\nconditions in <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1694\">Section 45(1)</a>, as it stood at the relevant time,\n\nunconstitutional in no way obliterated the provision from the statute\n\nbook. Therefore, it was open to the Parliament to cure the defect\n\nnoted by this Court and to revive the same provision as in the\n\npresent form, post amendment Act 13 of 2018 with effect form\n\n19.4.2018.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_587\">\n\n\n616   Supra at Footnote No.3\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_819\">\f                                   428</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_588\">126. Having said thus, we must now address the challenge to the\n\ntwin conditions as applicable post amendment of 2018.               That\n\nchallenge will have to be tested on its own merits and not in reference\n\nto the reasons weighed with this Court in declaring the provision,\n\n(as it existed at the relevant time), applicable only to offences\n\npunishable for a term of imprisonment of more than three years\n\nunder Part A of the Schedule to the 2002 Act. Now, the provision\n\n(<a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1695\">Section 45</a>) including twin conditions would apply to the offence(s)\n\nunder the 2002 Act itself. The provision post 2018 amendment, is\n\nin the nature of no bail in relation to the offence of money-laundering\n\nunless the twin conditions are fulfilled. The twin conditions are that\n\nthere are reasonable grounds for believing that the accused is not\n\nguilty of offence of money-laundering and that he is not likely to\n\ncommit any offence while on bail. Considering the purposes and\n\nobjects of the legislation in the form of 2002 Act and the background\n\nin which it had been enacted owing to the commitment made to the\n\ninternational bodies and on their recommendations, it is plainly\n\nclear that it is a special legislation to deal with the subject of money-\n\nlaundering activities having transnational impact on the financial\n\nsystems including sovereignty and integrity of the countries. This is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_820\">\f                                 429</span>\n\nnot an ordinary offence. To deal with such serious offence, stringent\n\nmeasures are provided in the 2002 Act for prevention of money-\n\nlaundering and combating menace of money-laundering, including\n\nfor attachment and confiscation of proceeds of crime and to\n\nprosecute persons involved in the process or activity connected with\n\nthe proceeds of crime. In view of the gravity of the fallout of money-\n\nlaundering activities   having transnational impact, a special\n\nprocedural law for prevention and regulation, including to prosecute\n\nthe person involved, has been enacted, grouping the offenders\n\ninvolved in the process or activity connected with the proceeds of\n\ncrime as a separate class from ordinary criminals. The offence of\n\nmoney-laundering has been regarded as an aggravated form of crime\n\n“world over”. It is, therefore, a separate class of offence requiring\n\neffective and stringent measures to combat the menace of money-\n\nlaundering.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_589\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_590\">127. There is no challenge to the provision on the ground of\n\nlegislative competence. The question, therefore, is: whether such\n\nclassification of offenders involved in the offence of money-\n\nlaundering is reasonable? Considering the concern expressed by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_821\">\f                                             430</span>\n\ninternational community regarding the money-laundering activities\n\nworld over and the transnational impact thereof, coupled with the\n\nfact that the presumption that the Parliament understands and\n\nreacts to the needs of its own people as per the exigency and\n\nexperience gained in the implementation of the law, the same must\n\nstand the test of fairness, reasonableness and having nexus with the\n\npurposes and objects sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act.\n\nNotably, there are several other legislations where such twin\n\nconditions have been provided for617. Such twin conditions in the\n\nconcerned provisions have been tested from time to time and have\n\nstood the challenge of the constitutional validity thereof.

The duty of the Court at this stage is not to\n\nweigh the evidence meticulously but to arrive at a finding on the\n\nbasis of broad probabilities. Further, the Court is required to record\n\na finding as to the possibility of the accused committing a crime\n\nwhich is an offence under the Act after grant of bail.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_592\">128. For understanding whether such twin conditions can be\n\nregarded as reasonable condition, we may usefully refer to the\n\ndecision of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Kartar Singh618.\n\nWhile dealing with the challenge to <a href=\"/doc/138932506/\" id=\"a_1708\">Section 20(8)</a> of TADA Act, the\n\nCourt rejected the argument that such provision results in\n\ndeprivation of liberty and violates <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1709\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1710\">21</a> of the\n\n\n\n618   Supra at Footnote No.190\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_823\">\f                                        432</span>\n\nConstitution. It noted that such provision imposes complete ban on\n\nrelease of accused on bail involved in the stated offence under the\n\nspecial legislation, but that ban stands diluted by virtue of twin\n\nconditions. It noted that rest of the provision, as in the case of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1711\">Section 45</a> of the 2002 Act, is comparable with the conditions\n\nspecified in the 1973 Code for release of accused on bail concerning\n\nordinary offence under general law.                The Constitution Bench\n\napproved the dictum in Usmanbhai Dawoodbhai Memon619 and in\n\nparagraph 349 noted thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_312\">              “349.

It is true that the source of power\n                    of a Designated Court to grant bail is not <a href=\"/doc/919170/\" id=\"a_1733\">Section\n                    20(8)</a> of the Act as it only places limitations on such\n                    power. This is made explicit by <a href=\"/doc/919170/\" id=\"a_1734\">Section 20(9)</a> which\n                    enacts that the limitations on granting of bail\n                    specified in <a href=\"/doc/919170/\" id=\"a_1735\">Section 20(8)</a> are ‘in addition to the\n                    limitations under the Code or any other law for the\n                    time being in force’. But it does not necessarily follow\n                    that the power of a Designated Court to grant bail is\n                    relatable to Section 439 of the Code.

The\n\ninternational bodies have been discussing the menace of money-\n\nlaundering on regular basis for quite some time; and strongly\n\nrecommended enactment of stringent legislation for prevention of\n\nmoney-laundering and combating with the menace thereof including\n\nto prosecute the offenders and for attachment and confiscation of\n\nthe proceeds of crime having direct impact on the financial systems\n\nand sovereignty and integrity of the countries. That concern has\n\nbeen duly noted even in the opening part of the introduction and\n\nStatement of Objects and Reasons, for which the 2002 Act came into\n\nbeing.   This declaration by the Parliament itself is testimony of\n\ncompelling necessity to have stringent regime (enactment) for\n\nprevention and control of the menace of money-laundering. Be it\n\nnoted that under <a href=\"/doc/1673816/\" id=\"a_1739\">Article 38</a> of the Constitution of India, it is the duty\n\nof the State to secure social, economic and political justice and\n\nminimize income inequalities. <a href=\"/doc/555882/\" id=\"a_1740\">Article 39</a> of the Constitution\n\nmandates the State to prevent concentration of wealth, thus, to\n\nrealize its socialist goal, it becomes imperative for the State to make\n\nsuch laws, which not only ensure that the unaccounted money is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_833\">\f                                   439</span>\n\ninfused back in the economic system of the country, but also prevent\n\nany activity which damages the economic fabric of the nation. It\n\ncannot be gainsaid that social and economic offences stand on a\n\ngraver footing as they not only involve an individual direct victim,\n\nbut harm the society as a whole627. Thus, the Law Commission also\n\nin its 47th report recommended an increase in punishment for most\n\nof the offences considered therein.        Further, the quantum of\n\npunishment for money-laundering offence, being only seven years,\n\ncannot be the basis to undermine the seriousness and gravity of this\n\noffence. The quantum of sentence is a matter of legislative policy.\n\nThe punishment provided for the offence is certainly one of the\n\nprinciples in deciding the gravity of the offence, however, it cannot\n\nbe said that it is the sole factor in deciding the severity of offence as\n\ncontended by the petitioners. Money-laundering is one of the\n\nheinous crimes, which not only affects the social and economic\n\nfabric of the nation, but also tends to promote other heinous\n\noffences, such as terrorism, offences related to <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1741\">NDPS Act</a>, etc. It is a\n\nproven fact that international criminal network that support home\n\ngrown extremist groups relies on transfer of unaccounted money\n\n\n627   47th Law Commission Report\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_834\">\f                                                 440</span>\n\nacross nation States628, thus, by any stretch of imagination, it\n\ncannot be said that there is no compelling State interest in providing\n\nstringent conditions of bail for the offence of money-laundering.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1232445\" id=\"span_835\">In\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1232445/\" id=\"a_1742\">Ram Jethmalani &amp; Ors. vs. Union of India &amp; Ors.629</a>, the Court\n\nexpounded the theory of “soft state” which is used to describe a\n\nnation which is not capable of preventing the offence of money-\n\nlaundering.

It must be so\n               construed that the court is able to maintain a\n               delicate balance between a judgment of acquittal and\n               conviction and an order granting bail much before\n               commencement of trial. Similarly, the Court will be\n               required to record a finding as to the possibility of his\n               committing a crime after grant of bail. However, such an\n               offence in futuro must be an offence under the Act and\n               not any other offence. Since it is difficult to predict the\n               future conduct of an accused, the court must necessarily\n               consider this aspect of the matter having regard to the\n               antecedents of the accused, his propensities and the\n               nature and manner in which he is alleged to have\n               committed the offence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_326\">               45. It is, furthermore, trite that for the purpose of\n               considering an application for grant of bail, although\n               detailed reasons are not necessary to be assigned,\n               the order granting bail must demonstrate application\n               of mind at least in serious cases as to why the\n               applicant has been granted or denied the privilege of\n               bail.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_327\">               46. The duty of the court at this stage is not to weigh\n               the evidence meticulously but to arrive at a finding\n               on the basis of broad probabilities. However, while\n               dealing with a special statute like MCOCA having\n               regard to the provisions contained in sub-section (4)\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_618\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"392071\" id=\"span_842\">634   Supra at Footnote No.275 (also at Footnote No.53)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_843\">\f                                               445</span>\n\n               of <a href=\"/doc/1566465/\" id=\"a_1751\">Section 21</a> of the Act, the court may have to probe\n               into the matter deeper so as to enable it to arrive at\n               a finding that the materials collected against the\n               accused during the investigation may not justify a\n               judgment of conviction. The findings recorded by the\n               court while granting or refusing bail undoubtedly\n               would be tentative in nature, which may not have\n               any bearing on the merit of the case and the trial\n               court would, thus, be free to decide the case on the\n               basis of evidence adduced at the trial, without in any\n               manner being prejudiced thereby”\n\n                                                          (emphasis supplied)\n\nWe are in agreement with the observation made by the Court in\n\nRanjitsing Brahmajeetsing Sharma635.

We are conscious of the fact that in paragraph 53 of the Nikesh\n\nTarachand Shah642, the Court noted that it had struck down\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1778\">Section 45</a> of the 2002 as a whole. However, in paragraph 54, the\n\ndeclaration is only in respect of further (two) conditions for release\n\non bail as contained in <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1779\">Section 45(1)</a>, being unconstitutional as the\n\nsame violated <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_1780\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1781\">21</a> of the Constitution.

We, therefore, confined\n\nourselves to the challenge to the twin conditions in the provision, as\n\nit stands to this date post amendment of 2018 and which, on\n\nanalysis of the decisions <a href=\"/doc/118322024/\" id=\"a_1783\">referred to above</a> dealing with concerned\n\nenactments having similar twin conditions as valid, we must reject\n\nthe challenge.

This argument\n\nis founded on clear misunderstanding of the scheme of the 2002 Act.\n\nAs we have repeatedly mentioned in the earlier part of this judgment\n\nthat the offence of money-laundering is one wherein a person,\n\ndirectly or indirectly, attempts to indulge or knowingly assists or\n\nknowingly is a party or is actually involved in any process or activity\n\nconnected with the proceeds of crime. The fact that the proceeds of\n\ncrime have been generated as a result of criminal activity relating to\n\na scheduled offence, which incidentally happens to be a non-\n\ncognizable offence, would make no difference. The person is not\n\nprosecuted for the scheduled offence by invoking provisions of the\n\n2002 Act, but only when he has derived or obtained property as a\n\nresult of criminal activity relating to or in relation to a scheduled\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_862\">\f                                              451</span>\n\noffence and then indulges in process or activity connected with such\n\nproceeds of crime. Suffice it to observe that the argument under\n\nconsideration is completely misplaced and needs to be rejected.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_631\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"118600838\" id=\"span_863\">137. Another incidental issue that had been raised is about the non-\n\napplication of rigors of <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1786\">Section 45</a> of the 2002 Act in respect of\n\nanticipatory bail filed under Section 438 of the 1973 Code. This\n\nsubmission presumably is linked to the observation in paragraph 42\n\nin the case of Nikesh Tarachand Shah643. Similar argument was\n\nconsidered in The Asst. <a href=\"/doc/118600838/\" id=\"a_1787\">Director Enforcement Directorate vs. Dr.\n\nV.C. Mohan644</a>. We are in agreement with the observation in this\n\ndecision that it is one thing to say that <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1788\">Section 45</a> of the 2002 Act\n\nrefers to a scheduled offence under the general law, but, as noted\n\nearlier, the offence under this Act in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1789\">Section 3</a> is specific to\n\ninvolvement in any process or activity connected with the proceeds\n\nof crime which is generated as a result of criminal activity relating\n\nto a scheduled offence. It is also true that <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1790\">Section 45</a> does not make\n\nspecific reference to Section 438 of the 1973 Code, but it cannot be\n\noverlooked that sub-section (1) opens with a non-obstante clause and\n\n\n643   Supra at Footnote No.3\n644   Criminal Appeal No.21 of 2022, decided on 4.1.2022\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_864\">\f                                       452</span>\n\nclearly provides that anything contained in the 1973 Code (2 of\n\n1974), no person accused of an offence under this Act shall be\n\nreleased on bail or on his own bond, unless the stipulations provided\n\ntherein are fulfilled.       On account of the non-obstante clause in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1791\">Section 45(1)</a> of the 2002 Act, the sweep of that provision must\n\nprevail in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1805569/\" id=\"a_1792\">Section 71</a> of the 2002 Act.                 Further, the\n\nexpression “anticipatory bail” is not used either in the 1973 Code or\n\nthe 2002 Act. The relief granted in terms of Section 438 of the 1973\n\nCode is one of directing release of the person on “bail” in case of his\n\narrest;   and   such     a    relief   has   been   described    in   judicial\n\npronouncements as anticipatory bail. <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1793\">Section 45(1)</a> uses generic\n\nexpression “bail” without reference to any provision of the 1973\n\nCode, such as Sections 437, 438 and 439 of the 1973 Code.\n\nConcededly, <a href=\"/doc/72194817/\" id=\"a_1794\">Section 65</a> of the 2002 Act states that the provisions of\n\nthe 1973 Code shall apply to the provisions under the Act insofar as\n\nthey are not inconsistent with the provisions of the 2002 Act.\n\nFurther, <a href=\"/doc/1805569/\" id=\"a_1795\">Section 71</a> of the Act gives overriding effect to the Act.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1796\">Section 45</a> of the Act begins with a non-obstante clause, thus\n\nexcluding the application of the 1973 Code in matters related to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_865\">\f                                               453</span>\n\n“bail”. The word “anticipatory bail” has not been defined under the\n\n1973 Code. In Sushila Aggarwal645, it was held as under:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_328\">               “7.1. At the outset, it is required to be noted that as\n               such the expression “anticipatory bail” has not been\n               defined in the Code. As observed by this Court in\n               Balchand Jain646, “anticipatory bail” means “bail in\n               anticipation of arrest”. As held by this Court, the\n               expression “anticipatory bail” is a misnomer\n               inasmuch as it is not as if bail is presently granted by\n               the court in anticipation of arrest. An application for\n               “anticipatory bail” in anticipation of arrest could be\n               moved by the accused at a stage before an FIR is filed or\n               at a stage when FIR is registered but the charge sheet has\n               not been filed and the investigation is in progress or at a\n               stage after the investigation is concluded. Power to grant\n               “anticipatory bail” under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_1797\">Section 438</a> of the CrPC vests\n               only with the Court of Session or the High Court.\n               Therefore, ultimately it is for the court concerned to\n               consider the application for “anticipatory bail” and while\n               granting the “anticipatory bail” it is ultimately for the\n               court concerned to impose conditions including the\n               limited period of “anticipatory bail”, depends upon the\n               stages at which the application for anticipatory bail is\n               moved. A person in whose favour a pre-arrest bail order\n               is made under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_1798\">Section 438</a> of the CrPC has to be arrested.\n               However, once there is an order of pre-arrest\n               bail/anticipatory bail, as and when he is arrested he has\n               to be released on bail. Otherwise, there is no distinction\n               or difference between the pre-arrest bail order under\n               Section 438 and the bail order under <a href=\"/doc/848468/\" id=\"a_1799\">Section 437</a> &amp; <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_1800\">439</a>\n               CrPC. The only difference between the pre-arrest bail\n               order under Section 438 and the bail order under\n               Sections 437 and 439 is the stages at which the bail order\n               is passed. The bail order under <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_1801\">Section 438</a> CrPC is prior\n               to his arrest and in anticipation of his arrest and the\n               order of bail under Sections 437 and 439 is after a person\n               is arrested. A bare reading of <a href=\"/doc/1783708/\" id=\"a_1802\">Section 438</a> CrPC shows\n               that there is nothing in the language of the Section which\n               goes to show that the pre-arrest bail granted under\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_632\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1868823\" id=\"span_866\">645   Supra at <a href=\"/doc/1868823/\" id=\"a_1803\">Footnote No.318\n646   Balchand Jain (Shri) vs. State of Madhya Pradesh</a>, (1976) 4 SCC 572\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_867\">\f                                              454</span>\n\n               Section 438 has to be time-bound. The position is the\n               same as in Section 437 and <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_1804\">Section 439</a> CrPC.”\n\n                                                         (emphasis supplied)\n\n\nThus, anticipatory bail is nothing but a bail granted in anticipation\n\nof arrest, hence, it has been held in various judgments by this Court\n\nthat the principles governing the grant of bail in both cases are more\n\nor less on the same footing, except that in case of anticipatory bail\n\nthe investigation is still underway requiring the presence of the\n\naccused         before      investigation       authority.          Thus,      ordinarily,\n\nanticipatory bail is granted in exceptional cases where the accused\n\nhas been falsely implicated in an offence with a view to harass and\n\nhumiliate him. Therefore, it would not be logical to disregard the\n\nlimitations imposed on granting bail under <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1805\">Section 45</a> of the 2002\n\nAct, in the case of anticipatory bail as well.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_633\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_634\">138.

The relief of bail, be it in the nature\n\nof regular bail or anticipatory bail, is circumscribed by the\n\nstipulations predicated in <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1817\">Section 45</a> of the 2002 Act.                 The\n\nunderlying principles of <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1818\">Section 45</a> of the 2002 Act would get\n\ntriggered in either case before the relief of bail in connection with the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_878\">\f                                  458</span>\n\noffence of money-laundering is taken forward.

The Union of India also recognized the right to speedy trial and\n\naccess to justice as fundamental right in their written submissions\n\nand, thus, submitted that in a limited situation right of bail can be\n\ngranted in case of violation of <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1836\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. Further,\n\nit is to be noted that the Section 436A of the 1973 Code was inserted\n\nafter the enactment of the 2002 Act. Thus, it would not be\n\nappropriate to deny the relief of Section 436A of the 1973 Code which\n\nis a wholesome provision beneficial to a person accused under the\n\n2002 Act. However, Section 436A of the 1973 Code, does not provide\n\nfor an absolute right of bail as in the case of default bail under\n\nSection 167 of the 1973 Code. For, in the fact situation of a case,\n\nthe Court may still deny the relief owing to ground, such as where\n\nthe trial was delayed at the instance of accused himself.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_649\">145. Be that as it may, in our opinion, this provision is comparable\n\nwith the statutory bail provision or, so to say, the default bail, to be\n\ngranted in terms of Section 167 of the 1973 Code consequent to\n\nfailure of the investigating agency to file the chargesheet within the\n\nstatutory period and, in the context of the 2002 Act, complaint\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_887\">\f                                 463</span>\n\nwithin the specified period after arrest of the person concerned. In\n\nthe case of Section 167 of the 1973 Code, an indefeasible right is\n\ntriggered in favour of the accused the moment the investigating\n\nagency commits default in filing the chargesheet/complaint within\n\nthe statutory period. The provision in the form of Section 436A of\n\nthe 1973 Code, as has now come into being is in recognition of the\n\nconstitutional right of the accused regarding speedy trial under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1837\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution. For, it is a sanguine hope of every\n\naccused, who is in custody in particular, that he/she should be tried\n\nexpeditiously — so as to uphold the tenets of speedy justice. If the\n\ntrial cannot proceed even after the accused has undergone one-half\n\nof the maximum period of imprisonment provided by law, there is no\n\nreason to deny him this lesser relief of considering his prayer for\n\nrelease on bail or bond, as the case may be, with appropriate\n\nconditions, including to secure his/her presence during the trial.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_650\">146. Learned Solicitor General was at pains to persuade us that this\n\nview would impact the objectives of the 2002 Act and is in the nature\n\nof super imposition of Section 436A of the 1973 Code over <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1838\">Section\n\n45</a> of the 2002 Act. He has also expressed concern that the same\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_888\">\f                                   464</span>\n\nlogic may be invoked in respect of other serious offences, including\n\nterrorist offences which would be counterproductive. So be it. We\n\nare not impressed by this submission. For, it is the constitutional\n\nobligation of the State to ensure that trials are concluded\n\nexpeditiously and at least within a reasonable time where strict bail\n\nprovisions apply. If a person is detained for a period extending up\n\nto one-half of the maximum period of imprisonment specified by law\n\nand is still facing trial, it is nothing short of failure of the State in\n\nupholding the constitutional rights of the citizens, including person\n\naccused of an offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_651\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_652\">147. Section 436A of the 1973 Code, is a wholesome beneficial\n\nprovision, which is for effectuating the right of speedy trial\n\nguaranteed by <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1839\">Article 21</a> of the Constitution and which merely\n\nspecifies the outer limits within which the trial is expected to be\n\nconcluded, failing which, the accused ought not to be detained\n\nfurther. Indeed, Section 436A of the 1973 Code also contemplates\n\nthat the relief under this provision cannot be granted mechanically.\n\nIt is still within the discretion of the Court, unlike the default bail\n\nunder Section 167 of the 1973 Code. Under Section 436A of the\n\n1973 Code, however, the Court is required to consider the relief on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_889\">\f                                 465</span>\n\ncase-to-case basis. As the proviso therein itself recognises that, in\n\na given case, the detention can be continued by the Court even\n\nlonger than one-half of the period, for which, reasons are to be\n\nrecorded by it in writing and also by imposing such terms and\n\nconditions so as to ensure that after release, the accused makes\n\nhimself/herself available for expeditious completion of the trial.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_653\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_890\">148. However, that does not mean that the principle enunciated by\n\nthis Court in Supreme Court Legal Aid Committee Representing\n\nUndertrial Prisoners662, to ameliorate the agony and pain of\n\npersons kept in jail for unreasonably long time, even without trial,\n\ncan be whittled down on such specious plea of the State. If the\n\nParliament/Legislature provides for stringent provision of no bail,\n\nunless the stringent conditions are fulfilled, it is the bounden duty\n\nof the State to ensure that such trials get precedence and are\n\nconcluded within a reasonable time, at least before the accused\n\nundergoes detention for a period extending up to one-half of the\n\nmaximum period of imprisonment specified for the concerned\n\noffence by law. [Be it noted, this provision (<a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_1840\">Section 436A</a> of the 1973\n\n\n662   Supra at Footnote No.658\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_891\">\f                                  466</span>\n\nCode) is not available to accused who is facing trial for offences\n\npunishable with death sentence].</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_654\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_655\">149. In our opinion, therefore, Section 436A needs to be construed\n\nas a statutory bail provision and akin to Section 167 of the 1973\n\nCode. Notably, learned Solicitor General has fairly accepted during\n\nthe arguments and also restated in the written notes that the\n\nmandate of Section 167 of the 1973 Code would apply with full force\n\neven to cases falling under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1841\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act, regarding\n\nmoney-laundering offences. On the same logic, we must hold that\n\nSection 436A of the 1973 Code could be invoked by accused arrested\n\nfor offence punishable under the 2002 Act, being a statutory bail.\n\n\n\nSECTION 50 OF THE 2002 ACT\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_656\">150. The validity of this provision has been challenged on the\n\nground of being violative of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1842\">Articles 20(3)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_1843\">21</a> of the Constitution.\n\nFor, it allows the authorised officer under the 2002 Act to summon\n\nany person and record his statement during the course of\n\ninvestigation.   Further, the provision mandates that the person\n\nshould disclose true and correct facts known to his personal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_892\">\f                                              467</span>\n\nknowledge in connection with the subject matter of investigation.\n\nThe person is also obliged to sign the statement so given with the\n\nthreat of being punished for the falsity or incorrectness thereof in\n\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/73380/\" id=\"a_1844\">Section 63</a> of the 2002 Act. Before we proceed to analyse\n\nthe matter further, it is apposite to reproduce <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_1845\">Section 50</a> of the 2002\n\nAct, as amended. The same reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_338\">             “50.

By this provision, the Director has been empowered to exercise\n\nthe same powers as are vested in a civil Court under the 1908 Code\n\nwhile trying a suit in respect of matters specified in sub-section (1).\n\nThis is in reference to <a href=\"/doc/941401/\" id=\"a_1853\">Section 13</a> of the 2002 Act dealing with powers\n\n\n664Subs. by Act 13 of 2018, sec. 208(f), for “Director” (w.e.f. 19-4-2018, vide G.S.R. 383(E),\ndated 19th April, 2018).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_894\">\f                                 469</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_663\">\n\nof Director to impose fine in respect of acts of commission and\n\nomission by the banking companies, financial institutions and\n\nintermediaries.   From the setting in which <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_1854\">Section 50</a> has been\n\nplaced and the expanse of empowering the Director with same\n\npowers as are vested in a civil Court for the purposes of imposing\n\nfine under <a href=\"/doc/941401/\" id=\"a_1855\">Section 13</a>, is obviously very specific and not otherwise.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_664\">153. Indeed, sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_1856\">Section 50</a> enables the Director,\n\nAdditional Director, Joint Director, Deputy Director or Assistant\n\nDirector to issue summon to any person whose attendance he\n\nconsiders necessary for giving evidence or to produce any records\n\nduring the course of any investigation or proceeding under this Act.\n\nWe have already highlighted the width of expression “proceeding” in\n\nthe earlier part of this judgment and held that it applies to\n\nproceeding before the Adjudicating Authority or the Special Court,\n\nas the case may be. Nevertheless, sub-section (2) empowers the\n\nauthorised officials to issue summon to any person.       We fail to\n\nunderstand as to how <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1857\">Article 20(3)</a> would come into play in respect\n\nof process of recording statement pursuant to such summon which\n\nis only for the purpose of collecting information or evidence in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_895\">\f                                               470</span>\n\nrespect of proceeding under this Act.                     Indeed, the person so\n\nsummoned, is bound to attend in person or through authorised\n\nagent and to state truth upon any subject concerning which he is\n\nbeing examined or is expected to make statement and produce\n\ndocuments as may be required by virtue of sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_1858\">Section\n\n50</a> of the 2002 Act. The criticism is essentially because of sub-\n\nsection (4) which provides that every proceeding under sub-sections\n\n(2) and (3) shall be deemed to be a judicial proceeding within the\n\nmeaning of <a href=\"/doc/308396/\" id=\"a_1859\">Sections 193</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1969991/\" id=\"a_1860\">228</a> of the IPC.                    Even so, the fact\n\nremains that <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1861\">Article 20(3)</a> or for that matter <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_1862\">Section 25</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act, would come into play only when the person so\n\nsummoned is an accused of any offence at the relevant time and is\n\nbeing compelled to be a witness against himself. This position is\n\nwell-established.           The Constitution Bench of this Court in M.P.\n\nSharma665 had dealt with a similar challenge wherein warrants to\n\nobtain documents required for investigation were issued by the\n\nMagistrate being violative of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1863\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution. This\n\nCourt opined that the guarantee in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1864\">Article 20(3)</a> is against\n\n\n\n\n665   Supra at Footnote No.324 (also at Footnote No.47)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_896\">\f                                      471</span>\n\n“testimonial compulsion” and is not limited to oral evidence. Not\n\nonly that, it gets triggered if the person is compelled to be a witness\n\nagainst himself, which may not happen merely because of issuance\n\nof summons for giving oral evidence or producing documents.\n\nFurther, to be a witness is nothing more than to furnish evidence\n\nand such evidence can be furnished by different modes. The Court\n\nwent on to observe as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_349\">         “Broadly stated the guarantee in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1865\">article 20(3)</a> is against\n         “testimonial compulsion”. It is suggested that this is\n         confined to the oral evidence of a person standing his trial\n         for an offence when called to the witness-stand. We can\n         see no reason to confine the content of the constitutional\n         guarantee to this barely literal import. So to limit it would\n         be to rob the guarantee of its substantial purpose and to\n         miss the substance for the sound as stated in certain\n         American decisions. The phrase used in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1866\">Article 20(3)</a> is\n         “to be a witness”. A person can “be a witness” not merely\n         by giving oral evidence but also by producing documents\n         or making intelligible gestures as in the case of a dumb\n         witness (See <a href=\"/doc/211471/\" id=\"a_1867\">section 119</a> of the Evidence Act) or the like.\n         “To be a witness” is nothing more than “to furnish\n         evidence”, and such evidence can be furnished through\n         the lips or by production of a thing or of a document or\n         in other modes. So far as production of documents is\n         concerned, no doubt <a href=\"/doc/334170/\" id=\"a_1868\">Section 139</a> of the Evidence Act says\n         that a person producing a document on summons is not\n         a witness. But that section is meant to regulate the right\n         of cross-examination. It is not a guide to the connotation\n         of the word “witness”, which must be understood in its\n         natural sense, i.e., as referring to a person who furnishes\n         evidence. Indeed, every positive volitional act which\n         furnishes evidence is testimony, and testimonial\n         compulsion connotes coercion which procures the\n         positive volitional evidentiary acts of the person, as\n         opposed to the negative attitude of silence or submission\n         on his part. Nor is there any reason to think that the\n         protection in respect of the evidence so procured is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_897\">\f                                               472</span>\n\n               confined to what transpires at the trial in the court room.\n               The phrase used in <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1869\">article 20(3)</a> is “to be a witness” and\n               not to “appear as a witness”. It follows that the protection\n               afforded to an accused in so far as it is related to the\n               phrase “to be a witness” is not merely in respect of\n               testimonial compulsion in the court room but may well\n               extend to compelled testimony previously obtained from\n               him. It is available therefore to a person against whom\n               a formal accusation relating to the commission of an\n               offence has been levelled which in the normal course\n               may result in prosecution. Whether it is available to\n               other persons in other situations does not call for\n               decision in this case.”\n                                                      (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_350\">154.

It does not appear from his evidence that\n               he had even accused the appellant of having committed\n               any offence.

In Kathi Kalu Oghad’s case678 the Court merely\n               set out the principles in the light of the effect of a formal\n               accusation on a person, viz., that he stands in the\n               character of an accused person at the time when he\n               makes the statement. Normally a person stands in the\n               character of an accused when a First Information\n               Report is lodged against him in respect of an offence\n               before an Officer competent to investigate it, or when\n               a complaint is made relating to the commission of an\n               offence before a Magistrate competent to try or send\n               to another Magistrate for trial the offence.

In respect of such action, the designated\n\nofficials have been empowered to summon any person for collection\n\nof information and evidence to be presented before the Adjudicating\n\nAuthority. It is not necessarily for initiating a prosecution against\n\nthe noticee as such.

At this stage,\n\nthere would be no formal document indicative of likelihood of\n\ninvolvement of such person as an accused of offence of money-\n\nlaundering. If the statement made by him reveals the offence of\n\nmoney-laundering or the existence of proceeds of crime, that\n\nbecomes actionable under the Act itself. To put it differently, at the\n\nstage of recording of statement for the purpose of inquiring into the\n\nrelevant facts in connection with the property being proceeds of\n\ncrime is, in that sense, not an investigation for prosecution as such;\n\nand in any case, there would be no formal accusation against the\n\nnoticee. Such summons can be issued even to witnesses in the\n\ninquiry so conducted by the authorised officials.     However, after\n\nfurther inquiry on the basis of other material and evidence, the\n\ninvolvement of such person (noticee) is revealed, the authorised\n\nofficials can certainly proceed against him for his acts of commission\n\nor omission.

It is, thus, clear that the power invested in the officials is one\n\nfor conducting inquiry into the matters relevant for ascertaining\n\nexistence of proceeds of crime and the involvement of persons in the\n\nprocess or activity connected therewith so as to initiate appropriate\n\naction against such person including of seizure, attachment and\n\nconfiscation of the property eventually vesting in the Central\n\nGovernment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_676\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_677\">163. We are conscious of the fact that the expression used in <a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1906\">Section\n\n2(1)(na)</a> of the 2002 Act is “investigation”, but there is obvious\n\ndistinction in the expression “investigation” occurring in the 1973\n\nCode. Under <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_1907\">Section 2(h)</a> of the 1973 Code, the investigation is done\n\nby a “police officer” or by any person (other than a Magistrate) who\n\nis authorised by a Magistrate thereby to collect the evidence\n\nregarding the crime in question. Whereas, the investigation under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/148112816/\" id=\"a_1908\">Section 2(1)(na)</a> of the 2002 Act is conducted by the Director or by\n\nan authority authorised by the Central Government under the 2002\n\nAct for the collection of evidence for the purpose of proceeding under\n\nthis Act. Obviously, this investigation is in the nature of inquiry to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_917\">\f                                     482</span>\n\ninitiate action against the proceeds of crime and prevent activity of\n\nmoney-laundering. In the process of such investigation, the Director\n\nor the authority authorised by the Central Government referred to in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_1909\">Section 48</a> of the 2002 Act is empowered to resort to attachment of the\n\nproceeds of crime and for that purpose, also to do search and seizure\n\nand to arrest the person involved in the offence of money-laundering.\n\nWhile doing so, the prescribed authority (Director, Additional Director,\n\nJoint Director, Deputy Director or Assistant Director) alone has been\n\nempowered to summon any person for recording his statement and\n\nproduction of documents as may be necessary by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_1910\">Section 50</a>\n\nof the 2002 Act. Sensu stricto, at this stage (of issuing summon), it is\n\nnot an investigation for initiating prosecution in respect of crime of\n\nmoney-laundering as such. That is only an incidental matter and may\n\nbe the consequence of existence of proceeds of crime and identification\n\nof persons involved in money-laundering thereof.               The legislative\n\nscheme makes it amply clear that the authority authorised under this\n\nAct is not a police officer as such. This becomes amply clear from the\n\nspeech of the then Finance Minister delivered in 2005, which reads\n\nthus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_362\">         “Sir, the Money-Laundering Act was passed by this House\n         in the year 2002, and number of steps have to be taken to\n         implement it. Sir, two kinds of steps were required. One was\n         to appoint an authority who will gather intelligence and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_918\">\f                              483</span>\n\ninformation, and the other was an authority to investigate\nand prosecute. <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1911\">This Act</a> was made to implement the political\ndeclaration adopted by the Special Session of the UN\nGeneral Assembly in 1999. <a href=\"/doc/1934732/\" id=\"a_1912\">Section 1(3)</a> of the Act stipulates\nthat the Act will come into force on such date as the Central\nGovernment may by notification appoint. While we were\nexamining the question of notifying the Act, I found that\nthere was certain lacunae in the Act. I regret to say that not\nenough homework had been done in the definitions, and in\nthe division of responsibility and authority. So, in\nconsultation with the Ministry of Law, we came to the\nconclusion that these lacunae had to be removed. Broadly,\nthe reasons for the amendment are the following.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_363\">     Under the existing provisions in <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1913\">Section 45</a> of the Act,\nevery offence is cognizable. If an offence is cognizable,\nthen any police officer in India can arrest an offender\nwithout warrant. At the same time, under <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_1914\">Section 19</a> of\nthe Act, only a Director or a Deputy Director or an\nAssistant Director or any other officer authorised, may\narrest an offender. Clearly, there was a conflict between\nthese two provisions. Under <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1915\">Section 45(1)(b)</a> of the Act, the\nSpecial Court shall not take cognizance of any offence\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1693109/\" id=\"a_1916\">Section 4</a> except upon a complaint made\nin writing by the Director or any other officer authorised by\nthe Central Government. So, what would happen to an\narrest made by any police officer in the case of a cognizable\noffence? Which is the court that will try the offence? Clearly,\nthere were inconsistencies in these provisions.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_364\">      They have now been removed. We have now enabled\nonly the Director or an officer authorised by him to\ninvestigate offences. Of course, we would, by rule, set up a\nthreshold; and, below that threshold, we would allow State\npolice officers also to take action.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_365\">     The second anomaly that we found was that the\nexpression “investigation officer” and the word\n“investigation” occur in a number of sections but they\nwere not defined in the Act. Consequently, one has to\ngo to the definition in the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1917\">Criminal Procedure Code</a> and\nthat Code provides only “investigation by a police\nofficer or by an officer authorised by a magistrate”. So,\nclearly, there was a lacuna in not enabling the Director\nor the Assistant Director under this Act to investigate\noffences. That has been cured now.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_366\">….\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_367\">     What we are doing is, we are inserting a new <a href=\"/doc/1445793/\" id=\"a_1918\">Section,\n2(n)(a)</a> defining the term, ‘investigation’; making an\namendment to <a href=\"/doc/646188/\" id=\"a_1919\">Sections 28</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1252855/\" id=\"a_1920\">29</a> and <a href=\"/doc/634898/\" id=\"a_1921\">30</a>, dealing with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_919\">\f                                      484</span>\n\n           tribunals; amending <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_1922\">Sections 44</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1923\">45</a> of the Act to\n           make the offence non-cognisable so that only the Director\n           could take action; and also making consequential\n           changes in <a href=\"/doc/1175622/\" id=\"a_1924\">Section 73</a>. I request hon. Members to kindly\n           approve of these amendments so that the Act could be\n           amended quickly and we could bring it into force.”\n                                               (emphasis supplied)\n\nFrom this speech, it is more than clear that the intention of the\n\nParliament was to empower the prescribed Authority under <a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_1925\">Section\n\n48</a> including the class of officers appointed for the purposes of this\n\nAct to investigate the matters falling within the purview of the Act\n\nand in the manner specified in that regard. By inserting <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1926\">Section\n\n45(1A)</a> in the 2002 Act vide amendment Act 20 of 2005, was\n\nessentially to restrict and explicitly disable the police officer from\n\ntaking cognizance of the offence of money-laundering much less\n\ninvestigating the same. It is a provision to restate that only the\n\nAuthority (<a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_1927\">Section 48</a>) under this Act is competent to do investigation\n\nin respect of matters specified under the 2002 Act and none else.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_678\">This provision rules out coextensive power to local police as well as\n\nthe authority authorised. As aforementioned, the officer specifically\n\nauthorised is also expected to confine the inquiry/investigation only\n\nin respect of matters under this Act and in the manner specified\n\ntherein.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_920\">\f                                             485</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_679\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_680\">164. The purposes and objects of the 2002 Act for which it has been\n\nenacted, is not limited to punishment for offence of money-\n\nlaundering, but also to provide measures for prevention of money-\n\nlaundering. It is also to provide for attachment of proceeds of crime,\n\nwhich are likely to be concealed, transferred or dealt with in any\n\nmanner which may result in frustrating any proceeding relating to\n\nconfiscation of such proceeds under the 2002 Act. <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1928\">This Act</a> is also\n\nto compel the banking companies, financial institutions and\n\nintermediaries to maintain records of the transactions, to furnish\n\ninformation of such transactions within the prescribed time in terms\n\nof Chapter IV of the 2002 Act684.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_681\">164A.         Considering the above, it is unfathomable as to how the\n\nauthorities referred to in <a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_1929\">Section 48</a> can be described as police\n\nofficer. The word “police” in common parlance means a civil force\n\nwhose main aim is to prevent and detect crimes and to maintain law\n\nand order of the nation as expounded in Barkat Ram685. In this\n\ndecision, while dealing with the role of Customs Officer under the\n\nLand Customs Act, 1924686, the Court opined as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_368\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_921\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"132042\" id=\"span_922\">“<a href=\"/doc/1612841/\" id=\"a_1930\">The Police Act, 1861</a> (Act V of 1861), is described as an\n               Act for the regulation of police, and is thus an Act for the\n\n\n684   See <a href=\"/doc/132042/\" id=\"a_1931\">Pareena Swarup</a> (supra <a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_1932\">at Footnote No.366</a>)\n685   Supra at Footnote No.24\n686   For short, “<a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_1933\">Land Customs Act</a>”\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_923\">\f                                     486</span>\n\n         regulation of that group of officers who come within the\n         word ‘police’ whatever meaning be given to that word. The\n         preamble of the Act further says: ‘whereas it is expedient\n         to re-organise the police and to make it a more efficient\n         instrument for the prevention and detection of crime, it is\n         enacted as follows’. This indicates that the police is the\n         instrument for the prevention and detection of crime\n         which can be said to be the main object and purpose\n         of having the police. <a href=\"/doc/654722/\" id=\"a_1934\">Sections 23</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1089586/\" id=\"a_1935\">25</a> lay down the\n         duties of the police officers and<a href=\"/doc/919170/\" id=\"a_1936\"> s. 20</a> deals with the\n         authority they can exercise. They can exercise such\n         authority as is provided for a police officer under the\n         <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_1937\">Police Act</a> and any Act for regulating criminal procedure.</span></span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_682\">         The authority given to police officers must naturally be to\n         enable them to discharge their duties efficiently. Of the\n         various duties mentioned in<a href=\"/doc/654722/\" id=\"a_1938\"> s. 23</a>, the more\n         important duties are to collect and communicate\n         intelligence affecting the public peace, to prevent the\n         commission of offences and public nuisances and to\n         detect and bring offenders to justice and to\n         apprehend all persons whom the police officer is\n         legally authorised to apprehend. It is clear, therefore,\n         in view of the nature of the duties imposed on the police\n         officers, the nature of the authority conferred and the\n         purpose of the police Act, that the powers which the\n         police officers enjoy are powers for the effective\n         prevention and detection of crime in order to\n         maintain law and order.”\n                                               (emphasis supplied)\n\nAnd again, opined thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_369\">         “….The Customs Officer, therefore, is not primarily\n         concerned with the detection and punishment of\n         crime committed by a person, but is mainly interested\n         in the detection and prevention of smuggling of goods and\n         safeguarding the recovery of customs duties. He is more\n         concerned with the goods and customs duty, than with\n         the offender.”\n\n\nThus, this Court concluded that the Customs Officer under the <a href=\"/doc/1059693/\" id=\"a_1939\">Land\n\nCustoms Act</a> is not a police officer within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_1940\">Section 25</a>\n\nof the Evidence Act. In that, the main object of the Customs Officer\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_924\">\f                                           487</span>\n\nis to safeguard goods and customs duty and detection and\n\nprevention of crime is an ancillary function.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_683\">165. On similar lines, in the case of Raja Ram Jaiswal687, while\n\nexamining the efficacy of confession made to an Excise Inspector\n\nunder the 1915 Act, the Court held as follows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_684\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_370\">               “(10). …Thus he can exercise all the powers which an\n               officer in charge of a police station can exercise under\n               Chapter XIV of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1941\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>. He can\n               investigate into offences, record statements of the\n               persons questioned by him, make searches, seize any\n               articles connected with an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/102616839/\" id=\"a_1942\">Excise\n               Act</a>, arrest an accused person, grant him bail, send\n               him up for trial before a Magistrate, file a charge-\n               sheet and so on. Thus his position in so far as\n               offences under the <a href=\"/doc/102616839/\" id=\"a_1943\">Excise Act</a> committed within the\n               area to which his appointment extends are concerned\n               is not different from that of an officer in charge of a\n               police station. As regards these offences not only is he\n               charged with the duty of preventing their commission but\n               also with their detection and is for these purposes\n               empowered to act in all respects as an officer in charge of\n               a police station. No doubt unlike an officer in charge of a\n               police station he is not charged with the duty of the\n               maintenance of law and order nor can he exercise the\n               powers of such officer with respect to offences under the\n               general law or under any other special laws. But all the\n               same, in so far as offences under the <a href=\"/doc/102616839/\" id=\"a_1944\">Excise Act</a> are\n               concerned, there is no distinction whatsoever in the\n               nature of the powers he exercises and those which a\n               police officer exercises in relation to offences which it is\n               his duty to prevent and bring to light. It would be logical,\n               therefore, to hold that a confession recorded by him\n               during an investigation into an excise offence cannot\n               reasonably be regarded as anything different from a\n               confession to a police officer. For, in conducting the\n\n\n687   Supra at Footnote No.30\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_925\">\f                            488</span>\n\ninvestigation he exercises the powers of a police\nofficer and the act itself deems him to be a police\nofficer, even though he does not belong to the police\nforce constituted under the <a href=\"/doc/1481639/\" id=\"a_1945\">Police Act</a>. It has been\nheld by this court that the expression “police officer” in<a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_1946\">\nS. 25</a> of the Evidence Act is not confined to persons who\nare members of the regularly constituted police force. The\nposition of an Excise Officer empowered under<a href=\"/doc/20197784/\" id=\"a_1947\"> S. 77(2)</a> of\nthe Bihar and Orissa Excise Act is not analogous to that\nof a Customs Officer for two reasons. One is that the\nExcise Officer, does not exercise any judicial powers just\nas the Customs Officer does under the Sea Customs Act,\n1878. Secondly, the Customs Officer is not deemed to be\nan officer in charge of a police station and therefore can\nexercise no powers under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1948\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>\nand certainly not those of an officer in charge of a police\nstation. No doubt, he too has the power to make a search,\nto seize articles suspected to have been smuggled and\narrest persons suspected of having committed an offence\nunder the Sea Customs Act. But that is all. Though he\ncan make an enquiry, he has no power to investigate into\nan offence under<a href=\"/doc/1291024/\" id=\"a_1949\"> S. 156</a> of the Code of Criminal\nProcedure. Whatever powers he exercises are expressly\nset out in the Sea Customs Act. Though some of those set\nout in Ch. XVII may be analogous to those of a Police\nOfficer under the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_1950\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> they are not\nidentical with those of a police officer and are not derived\nfrom or by reference to the Code. In regard to certain\nmatters, he does not possess powers even analogous to\nthose of a Police Officer. Thus he is not entitled to submit\na report to a Magistrate under<a href=\"/doc/686759/\" id=\"a_1951\"> S. 190</a> of the Code of\nCriminal Procedure with a view that cognizance of the\noffence be taken by the Magistrate. Section 187(A) of the\nSea Customs Act specifically provides that cognizance of\nan offence under the Sea Customs Act can be taken only\nupon a complaint in writing made by the Customs\nOfficers or other officer of the customs not below the rank\nof an Assistant Collector of Customs authorised in this\nbehalf by the Chief Customs Officer.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_685\">(11) It may well be that a statute confers powers and\nimposes duties on a public servant, some of which are\nanalogous to those of a police officer. But by reason of the\nnature of other duties which he is required to perform he\nmay be exercising various other powers also. It is argued\non behalf of the State that where such is the case the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_926\">\f                                           489</span>\n\n               mere conferral of some only of the powers of a police\n               officer on such a person would not make him a police\n               officer and, therefore, what must be borne in mind is the\n               sum total of the powers which he enjoys by virtue of his\n               office as also the dominant purpose for which he is\n               appointed. The contention thus is that when an officer\n               has to perform a wide range of duties and exercise\n               correspondingly a wide range of powers, the mere fact\n               that some of the powers which the statute confers upon\n               him are analogous to or even identical with those of a\n               police officer would not make him a police officer and,\n               therefore, if such an officer records a confession it would\n               not be hit by<a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_1952\"> S. 25</a> of the Evidence Act. In our judgment\n               what is pertinent to bear in mind for the purpose of\n               determining as to who can be regarded a ‘police officer’\n               for the purpose of this provision is not the totality of the\n               powers which an officer enjoys but the kind of powers\n               which the law enables him to exercise. The test for\n               determining whether such a person is a “police officer”\n               for the purpose of<a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_1953\"> S. 25</a> of the Evidence Act would, in our\n               judgment, be whether the powers of a police officer which\n               are conferred on him or which are exercisable by him\n               because he is deemed to be an officer in charge of police\n               station establish a direct or substantial relationship with\n               the prohibition enacted by<a href=\"/doc/1089586/\" id=\"a_1954\"> S. 25</a>, that is, the recording of\n               a confession. In other words, the test would be\n               whether the powers are such as would tend to\n               facilitate the obtaining by him of a confession from a\n               suspect or delinquent. If they do, then it is\n               unnecessary to consider the dominant purpose for\n               which he is appointed or the question as to what\n               other powers he enjoys. These questions may perhaps\n               be relevant for consideration where the powers of the\n               police officer conferred upon him are of a very limited\n               character and are not by themselves sufficient to\n               facilitate the obtaining by him of a confession.”\n\n                                                     (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_686\">166.

Thus\n         under<a href=\"/doc/1566465/\" id=\"a_1959\"> S. 21</a> it is the duty of the Central Excise Officer to\n         whom an arrested person is forwarded to inquire into the\n         charge made against such person.

A\n         police officer for purposes of Cl.

It cannot\n               therefore be said that the provision in<a href=\"/doc/1566465/\" id=\"a_1970\"> S. 21</a> is on par with\n               the provision in<a href=\"/doc/170328401/\" id=\"a_1971\"> S. 78(3)</a> of the Bihar and Orissa Excise\n               Act.

The petitioners, however, have pressed into service exposition\n\nof this Court in the recent decision in Tofan Singh691, which had\n\noccasion to deal with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1980\">NDPS Act</a> wherein the\n\nCourt held that the designated officer under that Act must be\n\nregarded as a police officer. The Court opined that the statement\n\nmade before him would be violative of protection guaranteed under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_1981\">Article 20(3)</a> of the Constitution.                    This decision has been rightly\n\ndistinguished by the learned Additional Solicitor General on the\n\nargument that the conclusion reached in that judgment is on the\n\nbasis of the legislative scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1982\">NDPS Act</a>, which permitted that\n\ninterpretation.          However, it is not possible to reach at the same\n\nconclusion in respect of the 2002 Act for more than one reason. In\n\nthis decision, the Court first noted that the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1983\">Act (NDPS Act</a>) under\n\n\n691   Supra at Footnote No.31 (also at Footnote No.24)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_932\">\f                                               493</span>\n\nconsideration was a penal statute. In the case of 2002 Act, however,\n\nsuch a view is not possible.                  The second aspect which we have\n\nrepeatedly adverted to, is the special purposes and objects behind\n\nthe enactment of the 2002 Act. As per the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1984\">NDPS\n\nAct</a>, it permitted both a regular police officer as well as a designated\n\nofficer, who is not a defined police officer, to investigate the offence\n\nunder that Act.              This has resulted in discrimination.         Such a\n\nsituation does not emerge from the provisions of the 2002 Act. The\n\n2002 Act, on the other hand, authorises only the authorities referred\n\nto in <a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_1985\">Section 48</a> to investigate/inquire into the matters under the\n\nAct in the manner prescribed therein.                    The provision inserted in\n\n2005 as <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_1986\">Section 45(1A)</a> is not to empower the regular police officers\n\nto take cognizance of the offence. On the other hand, it is a\n\nprovision to declare that the regular police officer is not\n\ncompetent to take cognizance of offence of money-laundering,\n\nas it can be investigated only by the authorities referred to in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_1987\">Section 48</a> of the 2002 Act. The third aspect which had\n\nweighed with the Court in Tofan Singh692 is that the police\n\nofficer investigating an offence under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1988\">NDPS Act</a>, the provisions\n\n\n692   Supra at Footnote No.31 (also at Footnote No.24)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_933\">\f                                 494</span>\n\nof Sections 161 to 164 of the 1973 Code as also <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_1989\">Section 25</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act, would come into play making the statement made\n\nbefore them by the accused as inadmissible.            Whereas, the\n\ninvestigation into the same offence was to be done by the designated\n\nofficer under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1990\">NDPS Act</a>, the safeguards contained in Sections\n\n161 to 164 of the 1973 Code and <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_1991\">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act, will\n\nhave no application and the statement made before them would be\n\ninadmissible in evidence. This had resulted in discrimination. No\n\nsuch situation emerges from the provisions of the 2002 Act.\n\nWhereas, the 2002 Act clearly authorises only the authorities under\n\nthe 2002 Act referred to in <a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_1992\">Section 48</a> to step in and summon the\n\nperson when occasion arises and proceed to record the statement\n\nand take relevant documents on record. For that, express provision\n\nhas been made authorising them to do so and by a legal fiction,\n\ndeemed it to be a statement recorded in a judicial proceeding by\n\nvirtue of <a href=\"/doc/1830223/\" id=\"a_1993\">Section 50(4)</a> of the 2002 Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_934\">A regular police officer will\n\nneither be in a position to take cognizance of the offence of money-\n\nlaundering, much less be permitted to record the statement which\n\nis to be made part of the proceeding before the Adjudicating\n\nAuthority under the 2002 Act for confirmation of the provisional\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_935\">\f                                   495</span>\n\nattachment order and confiscation of the proceeds of crime for\n\neventual vesting in the Central Government. That may entail in civil\n\nconsequences. It is a different matter that some material or evidence\n\nis made part of the complaint if required to be filed against the\n\nperson involved in the process or activity connected with money-\n\nlaundering so as to prosecute him for offence punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_1994\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act. The next point which has been reckoned\n\nby this Court in <a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_1995\">the said decision</a> is that in the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1996\">NDPS\n\nAct</a>, upon culmination of investigation of crime by a designated\n\nofficer under that Act (other than a Police Officer), he proceeds to file\n\na complaint; but has no authority to further investigate the offence,\n\nif required.   Whereas, if the same offence was investigated by a\n\nregular Police Officer after filing of the police report under Section\n\n173(2) of the 1973 Code, he could still do further investigation by\n\ninvoking Section 173(8) of the 1973 Code. This, on the face of it,\n\nwas discriminatory.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_690\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_691\">169. Notably, this dichotomy does not exist in the 2002 Act for more\n\nthan one reason. For, there is no role for the regular Police Officer.\n\nThe investigation is to be done only by the authorities under the\n\n2002 Act and upon culmination of the investigation, to file complaint\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_936\">\f                                               496</span>\n\nbefore the Special Court.                  Moreover, by virtue of Clause (ii) of\n\nExplanation in <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_1997\">Section 44(1)</a> of the 2002 Act, it is open to the\n\nauthorities under this Act to bring any further evidence, oral or\n\ndocumentary, against any accused person involved in respect of\n\noffence of money-laundering, for which, a complaint has already\n\nbeen filed by him or against person not named in the complaint and\n\nby legal fiction, such further complaint is deemed to be part of the\n\ncomplaint originally filed. Strikingly, in Tofan Singh692A the Court\n\nalso noted that, while dealing with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1998\">NDPS Act</a>,\n\nthe designated officer has no express power to file a closure report\n\nunlike the power bestowed on the police officer, if he had\n\ninvestigated the same crime under the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_1999\">NDPS Act</a>. Once again, this\n\nlack of authority to file closure report is not there in the 2002 Act.\n\nFor, by the virtue of proviso in <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_2000\">Section 44(1)(b)</a>, after conclusion of\n\ninvestigation, if no offence of money-laundering is made out\n\nrequiring filing of a complaint, the Authority under the Act expected\n\nto file such complaint, is permitted to file a closure report before the\n\nSpecial Court in that regard. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"832781\" id=\"span_937\">In that decision, while analysing the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_2001\">Section 67</a> of the NDPS Act, the Court noted that\n\nthe statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1752792/\" id=\"a_2002\">Section 67</a> of that Act was to be held\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_2003\">692A</a>   Supra at Footnote No.31 (also at Footnote No.24)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_938\">\f                                    497</span>\n\nas inadmissible in all situations. That renders <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_2004\">Section 53A</a> of the\n\nsame Act otiose. <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_2005\">Section 53A</a> of the NDPS Act is about relevancy of\n\nstatement made under certain circumstances.                Realising the\n\nconflicting position emerging in the two provisions, the issue came\n\nto be answered.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_692\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_693\">170. However, in the case of provisions of the 2002 Act, there is no\n\nsimilar provision as <a href=\"/doc/686843/\" id=\"a_2006\">Section 53A</a> of the NDPS Act. As a result, even\n\nthis deficiency noticed in that judgment has no application to the\n\nprovisions of the 2002 Act. The Court also noted in that decision\n\nthat unlike the provisions of in the Customs Acts, 1962, <a href=\"/doc/110162683/\" id=\"a_2007\">Central\n\nExcise Act, 1944</a> and <a href=\"/doc/38107498/\" id=\"a_2008\">Railway Property (Unlawful Possession) Act,\n\n1966</a>, in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_2009\">NDPS Act</a> prevention, detection and punishment\n\nof crime cannot be said to be ancillary to the purpose of regulating\n\nand exercising of control over narcotic drugs and psychotropic\n\nsubstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_694\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_695\">171. We have already adverted to the purposes and objects for\n\nenacting the 2002 Act. It is a sui generis legislation, not only dealing\n\nwith the prevention, detection, attachment, confiscation, vesting and\n\nmaking    it   obligatory   for   the     banking   companies,   financial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_939\">\f                                 498</span>\n\ninstitutions and intermediaries to comply with certain essential\n\nformalities and make them accountable for failure thereof, and also\n\npermits prosecution of the persons found involved in the money-\n\nlaundering activity. Keeping in mind the sweep of the purposes and\n\nobjectives of the 2002 Act, the reason weighed with this Court while\n\ndealing with the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_2010\">NDPS Act</a>, will have no bearing\n\nwhatsoever. In that decision, this Court also noted that the offences\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_2011\">NDPS Act</a> are cognizable as opposed to other statutes\n\n<a href=\"/doc/832781/\" id=\"a_2012\">referred to above</a>. The scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_2013\">NDPS Act</a>, including regarding\n\nmaking offences under that Act as cognizable by the designated\n\nofficer as well as the local police, and the scheme of the 2002 Act is\n\nentirely different.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_696\">\n171A. Indeed, in the original 2002 Act, as enacted, the offence of\n\nmoney-laundering was made cognizable as a result of which\n\nconfusion had prevailed in dealing with the said crime when the\n\nlegislative intent was only to authorise the Authority under the 2002\n\nAct to deal with such cases. That position stood corrected in 2005,\n\nas noticed earlier. The fact that the marginal note of <a href=\"/doc/1821448/\" id=\"a_2014\">Section 45</a>\n\nretains marginal note that offences to be cognizable and non-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_940\">\f                                               499</span>\n\nbailable, however, does not mean that the regular Police Officer is\n\ncompetent to take cognizance of the offence of money-laundering.\n\nWhereas, that description has been retained for the limited purpose\n\nof understanding that the offence of money-laundering is cognizable\n\nand non-bailable and can be inquired into and investigated by the\n\nAuthority under the 2002 Act alone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_697\">172. In other words, there is stark distinction between the scheme\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/1727139/\" id=\"a_2015\">NDPS Act</a> dealt with by this Court in Tofan Singh693 and that\n\nin the provisions of the 2002 Act under consideration. Thus, it must\n\nfollow that the authorities under the 2002 Act are not Police Officers.\n\nEx-consequenti, the statements recorded by authorities under the\n\n2002 Act, of persons involved in the commission of the offence of\n\nmoney-laundering               or    the     witnesses   for   the   purposes   of\n\ninquiry/investigation, cannot be hit by the vice of <a href=\"/doc/366712/\" id=\"a_2016\">Article 20(3)</a> of the\n\nConstitution or for that matter, <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_2017\">Article 21</a> being procedure\n\nestablished by law. In a given case, whether the protection given to\n\nthe accused who is being prosecuted for the offence of money-\n\nlaundering, of <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_2018\">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act is available or not, may\n\nhave to be considered on case-to-case basis being rule of evidence.\n\n\n\n693   Supra at Footnote No.31 (also at Footnote No.24)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_941\">\f                                               500</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_698\">173. We may note that the learned Additional Solicitor General was\n\nat pains to persuade us to take the view that the decision in Tofan\n\nSingh694 is per incuriam. For the reasons already noted, we do not\n\ndeem it necessary to examine that argument.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_699\">\nSECTION 63 OF THE 2002 ACT\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_700\">174. By this provision, penal consequences are provided in respect\n\nof acts of commission and omission by any person who wilfully and\n\nmaliciously gives false information and so causing an arrest or a\n\nsearch under this Act; also against the person legally bound to state\n\nthe truth of any matter relating to an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_2019\">Section 3</a>, but\n\nrefuses to answer such any question put to him by the Authority\n\nunder the 2002 Act or refuses to sign any statement made by him in\n\nthe course of any proceedings under the Act including failure to\n\nattend or produce books of account or documents when called upon\n\nto do so. <a href=\"/doc/73380/\" id=\"a_2020\">Section 63</a> reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_374\">               “63.

It is in the nature of providing consequences for\n\nnot discharging the burden or cooperating with the authorities\n\nduring the proceedings before the Authority and pursuant to\n\nsummons, production of documents and to give evidence is issued\n\nby such Authority in exercise of power under <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_2024\">Section 50</a> of the 2002\n\n695   Ins. by Act 2 of 2013, <a href=\"/doc/186683/\" id=\"a_2025\">sec.26</a> (w.e.f. 15-2-2013, vide S.O. 343(E), dated 8-2-2013)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_943\">\f                                 502</span>\n\nAct. The power exercised by the Authority is analogous to power\n\nvested in a civil Court under the 1908 Code while trying a suit in\n\nrespect of matters referred to in <a href=\"/doc/961083/\" id=\"a_2026\">Section 50</a> of the 2002 Act. This is\n\nin the nature of deeming provision empowering the concerned\n\nAuthority to ensure prevention of money-laundering and also to take\n\nconsequential steps for attachment and confiscation of the property\n\ninvolved in such money-laundering to be vested in the Central\n\nGovernment. Absent such authority given to the Director under the\n\n2002 Act, the inquiry or investigation required to be done for\n\nfulfilling the mandate predicated under the 2002 Act, would\n\neventually result in paper inquiry and no meaningful purpose would\n\nbe served much less to combat the menace of money-laundering. In\n\nsuch inquiry if misleading revelations are made by any person or for\n\nthat matter fails to cooperate, is required to be proceeded in\n\naccordance with law. In that sense, <a href=\"/doc/73380/\" id=\"a_2027\">Section 63</a> is the procedure\n\nestablished by law. It is unfathomable to countenance the argument\n\nthat such a provision must be regarded as unreasonable or\n\nmanifestly arbitrary.

In that, the property\n\nderived or obtained as a result of criminal activity relating to notified\n\noffences, termed as scheduled offence, is regarded as tainted\n\nproperty and dealing with such property in any manner is an offence\n\nof money-laundering.

The classification or grouping of offences for\n\ntreating the same as relevant for constituting offence of money-\n\nlaundering is a matter of legislative policy. The Parliament in its\n\nwisdom has regarded the property derived or obtained as a result of\n\nspecified criminal activity, being an offence under the concerned\n\nlegislation mentioned in the Schedule. The fact that some of the\n\noffences may be non-cognizable offences under the concerned\n\nlegislation or regarded as minor and compoundable offences, yet, the\n\nParliament in its wisdom having perceived the cumulative effect of\n\nthe process or activity concerning the proceeds of crime generated\n\nfrom such criminal activities as being likely to pose threat to the\n\neconomic stability, sovereignty and integrity of the country and thus,\n\ngrouped them together for reckoning it as an offence of money-\n\nlaundering, is a matter of legislative policy. It is not open to the\n\nCourt to have a second guess at such a policy.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_781\">\n175A.   Needless to underscore that the 2002 Act is intended to\n\ninitiate action in respect of money-laundering activity which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_963\">\f                                 517</span>\n\nnecessarily is associated with the property derived or obtained by\n\nany person, directly or indirectly, as a result of specified criminal\n\nactivity. The prosecution under this Act is not in relation to the\n\ncriminal activity per se but limited to property derived or obtained\n\nfrom specified criminal activity.      Resultantly, the inclusion of\n\ncriminal activity which has been regarded as non-cognizable,\n\ncompoundable or minor offence under the concerned legislation,\n\nshould have no bearing to answer the matter in issue. In that, the\n\noffence of money-laundering is an independent offence and the\n\npersons involved in the commission of such offence are grouped\n\ntogether as offenders under this Act. There is no reason to make\n\ndistinction between them insofar as the offence of money-laundering\n\nis concerned. In our opinion, therefore, there is no merit in the\n\nargument under consideration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_782\">\n\nECIR VIS-À-VIS FIR\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_783\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"10239019\" id=\"span_964\">176. As per the procedure prescribed by the 1973 Code, the officer\n\nin-charge of a police station is under an obligation to record the\n\ninformation relating to the commission of a cognizable offence, in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_965\">\f                                               518</span>\n\nterms of Section 154 of the 1973 Code703. There is no corresponding\n\nprovision in the 2002 Act requiring registration of offence of money-\n\nlaundering.           As noticed earlier, the mechanism for proceeding\n\nagainst the property being proceeds of crime predicated in the 2002\n\nAct is a sui generis procedure. No comparison can be drawn between\n\nthe mechanism regarding prevention, investigation or trial in\n\nconnection with the scheduled offence governed by the provisions of\n\nthe 1973 Code. In the scheme of 2002 Act upon identification of\n\nexistence of property being proceeds of crime, the Authority under\n\nthis Act is expected to inquire into relevant aspects in relation to such\n\nproperty and take measures as may be necessary and specified in\n\nthe 2002 Act including to attach the property for being dealt with as\n\nper the provisions of the 2002 Act. We have elaborately adverted to\n\nthe procedure to be followed by the authorities for such attachment\n\nof the property being proceeds of crime and the follow-up steps of\n\nconfiscation upon confirmation of the provisional attachment order\n\nby the Adjudicating Authority.                   For facilitating the Adjudicating\n\nAuthority to confirm the provisional attachment order and direct\n\nconfiscation, the authorities under the 2002 Act (i.e., <a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_2089\">Section 48</a>) are\n\n\n703   <a href=\"/doc/10239019/\" id=\"a_2090\">Lalita Kumari</a> (supra at Footnote Nos.13 and 206)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_966\">\f                                 519</span>\n\nexpected to make an inquiry and investigate. Incidentally, when\n\nsufficient credible information is gathered by the authorities during\n\nsuch inquiry/investigation indicative of involvement of any person\n\nin any process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime, it is\n\nopen to such authorities to file a formal complaint before the Special\n\nCourt naming the concerned person for offence of money-laundering\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_2091\">Section 3</a> of this Act. Considering the scheme of the 2002 Act,\n\nthough the offence of money-laundering is otherwise regarded as\n\ncognizable offence (cognizance whereof can be taken only by the\n\nauthorities referred to in <a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_2092\">Section 48</a> of this Act and not by\n\njurisdictional police) and punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1693109/\" id=\"a_2093\">Section 4</a> of the 2002\n\nAct, special complaint procedure is prescribed by law.           This\n\nprocedure overrides the procedure prescribed under 1973 Code to\n\ndeal with other offences (other than money-laundering offences) in\n\nthe matter of registration of offence and inquiry/investigation\n\nthereof. This special procedure must prevail in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1805569/\" id=\"a_2094\">Section 71</a>\n\nof the 2002 Act and also keeping in mind <a href=\"/doc/72194817/\" id=\"a_2095\">Section 65</a> of the same Act.\n\nIn other words, the offence of money-laundering cannot be registered\n\nby the jurisdictional police who is governed by the regime under\n\nChapter XII of the 1973 Code. The provisions of Chapter XII of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_967\">\f                                  520</span>\n\n1973 Code do not apply in all respects to deal with information\n\nderived relating to commission of money-laundering offence much\n\nless investigation thereof. The dispensation regarding prevention of\n\nmoney-laundering,     attachment        of   proceeds   of   crime   and\n\ninquiry/investigation of offence of money-laundering upto filing of\n\nthe complaint in respect of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_2096\">Section 3</a> of the 2002 Act\n\nis fully governed by the provisions of the 2002 Act itself. To wit,\n\nregarding survey, searches, seizures, issuing summons, recording of\n\nstatements of concerned persons and calling upon production of\n\ndocuments, inquiry/investigation, arrest of persons involved in the\n\noffence of money-laundering including bail and attachment,\n\nconfiscation and vesting of property being proceeds of crime. Indeed,\n\nafter arrest, the manner of dealing with such offender involved in\n\noffence of money-laundering would then be governed by the\n\nprovisions of the 1973 Code - as there are no inconsistent provisions\n\nin the 2002 Act in regard to production of the arrested person before\n\nthe jurisdictional Magistrate within twenty-four hours and also filing\n\nof the complaint before the Special Court within the statutory period\n\nprescribed in the 1973 Code for filing of police report, if not released\n\non bail before expiry thereof.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_968\">\f                                  521</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_784\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_785\">177. Suffice it to observe that being a special legislation providing\n\nfor special mechanism regarding inquiry/investigation of offence of\n\nmoney-laundering, analogy cannot be drawn from the provisions of\n\n1973 Code, in regard to registration of offence of money-laundering\n\nand more so being a complaint procedure prescribed under the 2002\n\nAct. Further, the authorities referred to in <a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_2097\">Section 48</a> of the 2002\n\nAct alone are competent to file such complaint.        It is a different\n\nmatter that the materials/evidence collected by the same authorities\n\nfor the purpose of civil action of attachment of proceeds of crime and\n\nconfiscation thereof may be used to prosecute the person involved in\n\nthe process or activity connected with the proceeds of crime for\n\noffence of money-laundering. Considering the mechanism of\n\ninquiry/investigation for proceeding against the property (being\n\nproceeds of crime) under this Act by way of civil action (attachment\n\nand confiscation), there is no need to formally register an ECIR,\n\nunlike registration of an FIR by the jurisdictional police in respect of\n\ncognizable offence under the ordinary law.       There is force in the\n\nstand taken by the ED that ECIR is an internal document created\n\nby the department before initiating penal action or prosecution\n\nagainst the person involved with process or activity connected with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_969\">\f                                  522</span>\n\nproceeds of crime. Thus, ECIR is not a statutory document, nor\n\nthere is any provision in 2002 Act requiring Authority referred to in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_2098\">Section 48</a> to record ECIR or to furnish copy thereof to the accused\n\nunlike Section 154 of the 1973 Code. The fact that such ECIR has\n\nnot been recorded, does not come in the way of the authorities\n\nreferred to in <a href=\"/doc/194255/\" id=\"a_2099\">Section 48</a> of the 2002 Act to commence\n\ninquiry/investigation for initiating civil action of attachment of\n\nproperty being proceeds of crime by following prescribed procedure\n\nin that regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_786\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_787\">178. The next issue is: whether it is necessary to furnish copy of\n\nECIR to the person concerned apprehending arrest or at least after\n\nhis arrest? <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_2100\">Section 19(1)</a> of the 2002 Act postulates that after arrest,\n\nas soon as may be, the person should be informed about the grounds\n\nfor such arrest. This stipulation is compliant with the mandate of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1293832/\" id=\"a_2101\">Article 22(1)</a> of the Constitution. Being a special legislation and\n\nconsidering the complexity of the inquiry/investigation both for the\n\npurposes of initiating civil action as well as prosecution, non-supply\n\nof ECIR in a given case cannot be faulted. The ECIR may contain\n\ndetails of the material in possession of the Authority and recording\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_970\">\f                                 523</span>\n\nsatisfaction of reason to believe that the person is guilty of money-\n\nlaundering offence, if revealed before the inquiry/investigation\n\nrequired to proceed against the property being proceeds of crime\n\nincluding to the person involved in the process or activity connected\n\ntherewith, may have deleterious impact on the final outcome of the\n\ninquiry/investigation.   So long as the person has been informed\n\nabout grounds of his arrest that is sufficient compliance of mandate\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/1293832/\" id=\"a_2102\">Article 22(1)</a> of the Constitution. Moreover, the arrested person\n\nbefore being produced before the Special Court within twenty-four\n\nhours or for that purposes of remand on each occasion, the Court is\n\nfree to look into the relevant records made available by the Authority\n\nabout the involvement of the arrested person in the offence of\n\nmoney-laundering. In any case, upon filing of the complaint before\n\nthe statutory period provided in 1973 Code, after arrest, the person\n\nwould get all relevant materials forming part of the complaint filed\n\nby the Authority under <a href=\"/doc/109977/\" id=\"a_2103\">Section 44(1)(b)</a> of the 2002 Act before the\n\nSpecial Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_788\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_789\">179. Viewed thus, supply of ECIR in every case to person concerned\n\nis not mandatory. From the submissions made across the Bar, it is\n\nnoticed that in some cases ED has furnished copy of ECIR to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_971\">\f                                  524</span>\n\nperson before filing of the complaint. That does not mean that in\n\nevery case same procedure must be followed. It is enough, if ED at\n\nthe time of arrest, contemporaneously discloses the grounds of such\n\narrest to such person. Suffice it to observe that ECIR cannot be\n\nequated with an FIR which is mandatorily required to be recorded\n\nand supplied to the accused as per the provisions of 1973 Code.\n\nRevealing a copy of an ECIR, if made mandatory, may defeat the\n\npurpose sought to be achieved by the 2002 Act including frustrating\n\nthe attachment of property (proceeds of crime). Non-supply of ECIR,\n\nwhich is essentially an internal document of ED, cannot be cited as\n\nviolation of constitutional right. Concededly, the person arrested, in\n\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/128102/\" id=\"a_2104\">Section 19</a> of the 2002 Act, is contemporaneously made\n\naware about the grounds of his arrest. This is compliant with the\n\nmandate of <a href=\"/doc/1293832/\" id=\"a_2105\">Article 22(1)</a> of the Constitution. It is not unknown that\n\nat times FIR does not reveal all aspects of the offence in question. In\n\nseveral cases, even the names of persons actually involved in the\n\ncommission of offence are not mentioned in the FIR and described\n\nas unknown accused. Even, the particulars as unfolded are not fully\n\nrecorded in the FIR.     Despite that, the accused named in any\n\nordinary offence is able to apply for anticipatory bail or regular bail,\n\nin which proceeding, the police papers are normally perused by the\n\nconcerned Court. On the same analogy, the argument of prejudice\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_972\">\f                                  525</span>\n\npressed into service by the petitioners for non-supply of ECIR\n\ndeserves to be answered against the petitioners. For, the arrested\n\nperson for offence of money-laundering is contemporaneously\n\ninformed about the grounds of his arrest; and when produced before\n\nthe Special Court, it is open to the Special Court to call upon the\n\nrepresentative of ED to produce relevant record concerning the case\n\nof the accused before him and look into the same for answering the\n\nneed for his continued detention. Taking any view of the matter,\n\ntherefore, the argument under consideration does not take the\n\nmatter any further.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_790\">\nED MANUAL\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_791\">180. It had been urged that the 2002 Act creates an overbroad\n\nframe with no fetters on investigation.     Besides questioning the\n\nrefusal to furnish copy of ECIR, grievance is also made about the\n\nopacity surrounding the usage of ED Manual. Relying on <a href=\"/doc/13503/\" id=\"a_2106\">Section\n\n4(b)(v)</a> of the RTI Act, it was urged that it was obligatory on the part\n\nof the Public Authority to publish the stated Manual within 120 days\n\nof the enactment of <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_2107\">RTI Act</a>.     All other authorities including the\n\nCentral Vigilance Commission, Income-tax Authorities, Authorities\n\nunder 1962 Act, Police Authorities, Jail Authorities have adhered to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_973\">\f                                               526</span>\n\nthis statutory compliance, except the ED.                      In response, it is\n\nsubmitted by the learned Additional Solicitor General that ED\n\nManual is an internal departmental document only for the use of\n\nofficers of the ED. It is to give them guidance on proper enforcement\n\nof 2002 Act and outlines the procedure for implementation of the\n\nprovisions of this Act.                In addition, reliance is placed on the\n\nexposition of the Constitution Bench of this Court in Lalita\n\nKumari704. In paragraph 89 of this decision, the Court observed\n\nthus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_393\">               “89. Besides, the learned Senior Counsel relied on\n               the special procedures prescribed under the CBI\n               Manual to be read into Section 154. It is true that\n               the concept of “preliminary inquiry” is contained in\n               Chapter IX of the Crime Manual of CBI. However,\n               this Crime Manual is not a statute and has not\n               been enacted by the legislature. It is a set of\n               administrative orders issued for internal guidance\n               of the CBI officers. It cannot supersede the Code.\n               Moreover, in the absence of any indication to the\n               contrary in the Code itself, the provisions of the CBI\n               Crime Manual cannot be relied upon to import the\n               concept of holding of preliminary inquiry in the\n               scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_2108\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>. At this\n               juncture, it is also pertinent to submit that CBI is\n               constituted under a special Act, namely, the <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_2109\">Delhi\n               Special Police Establishment Act, 1946</a> and it\n               derives its power to investigate from this Act.”\n\n\n\n\n704   Supra at Footnote No.206 (also at Footnote No.13)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_974\">\f                                 527</span>\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_792\">181. It is true that the ED Manual may be an internal document for\n\ndepartmental use and in the nature of set of administrative orders.\n\nIt is equally true that the accused or for that matter common public\n\nmay not be entitled to have access to such administrative\n\ninstructions being highly confidential and dealing with complex\n\nissues concerning mode and manner of investigation, for internal\n\nguidance of officers of ED. It is also correct to say that there is no\n\nsuch requirement under the 2002 Act or for that matter, that there\n\nis nothing like investigation of a crime of money-laundering as per\n\nthe scheme of 2002 Act. The investigation, however, is to track the\n\nproperty being proceeds of crime and to attach the same for being\n\ndealt with under the 2002 Act. Stricto sensu, it is in the nature of\n\nan inquiry in respect of civil action of attachment. Nevertheless,\n\nsince the inquiry in due course ends in identifying the offender who\n\nis involved in the process or activity connected with the proceeds of\n\ncrime and then to prosecute him, it is possible for the department to\n\noutline the situations in which that course could be adopted in\n\nreference to specific provisions of 2002 Act or the Rules framed\n\nthereunder; and in which event, what are the options available to\n\nsuch person before the Authority or the Special Court, as the case\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_975\">\f                                 528</span>\n\nmay be.     Such document may come handy and disseminate\n\ninformation to all concerned. At least the feasibility of placing such\n\ndocument on the official website of ED may be explored.\n\n\n\nAPPELLATE TRIBUNAL\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_793\">182. Serious grievance has been made about the vacancies in the\n\nAppellate Tribunal despite the serious prejudice being caused on\n\naccount of provisional attachment order and, in some cases, taking\n\nover possession of the property so attached. This grievance, even\n\nthough genuine, cannot be the basis to test the validity of the\n\nprovisions of the 2002 Act or to question the efficacy of those\n\nprovisions on that account.       The Parliament by this special\n\nlegislation having created an expert body being Appellate Tribunal\n\nto deal with matters concerning attachment, possession and\n\nconfiscation and vesting of property in the Central Government, it\n\nis, but necessary, that the forum should be functional and accessible\n\nto the aggrieved persons uninterruptedly. We need to impress upon\n\nthe Executive to take necessary corrective measures in this regard.\n\nAbsent such forum, the aggrieved persons have to rush to the High\n\nCourt on every occasion which indeed is avoidable.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_976\">\f                                             529</span>\n\nPUNISHMENT UNDER SECTION 4 OF THE 2002 ACT\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_794\">183. It is urged that there is no gradation of punishment depending\n\non the nature of offence which may be committed by the principal\n\noffender and other offenders. Section 4704A of the 2002 Act makes\n\nno distinction between person directly involved in the process or\n\nactivity connected with the proceeds of crime and the other not so\n\ndirectly involved. Further, the scheduled offence may have been\n\ncommitted by someone else and the offence of money-laundering by\n\nthird person owing to being involved in the process or activity\n\nconnected with the proceeds of crime. The petitioners have relied on\n\n<a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_2110\">Section 201</a> and <a href=\"/doc/66955/\" id=\"a_2111\">212</a> of IPC. It is their case that this distinction is\n\nabsent in <a href=\"/doc/1693109/\" id=\"a_2112\">Section 4</a> of the 2002 Act which provides that the term of\n\nrigorous imprisonment shall not be less than three years and extend\n\nupto seven years or ten years, as the case may be, with fine. This\n\nargument to say the least is flimsy and tenuous.                                 For, the\n\npunishment under <a href=\"/doc/1693109/\" id=\"a_2113\">Section 4</a> is not in relation to the predicate\n\noffence, but offence of money-laundering under <a href=\"/doc/1840572/\" id=\"a_2114\">Section 3</a> of the 2002\n\n704A 4.
