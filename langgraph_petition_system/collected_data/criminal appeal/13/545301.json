Seventeen\t lives were  lost in the course of a\nseries of  five incidents which occurred in quick succession\nin five different villages, situated in the vicinity of each\nother, in  Punjab, on the night between August 12 and August\n13, 1977. The seventeen persons who lost their lives and the\nthree  who  substained\tinjuries  included  men,  women\t and\nchildren related to one Amar Singh and his sister Piaro Bai.\n     In this  connection one  Machhi Singh  and\t his  eleven\ncompanions, close  relatives and  associates were prosecuted\nin five\t sessions cases,  each pertaining  to the  concerned\nvillage in  which the  killings took place. Machhi Singh was\nthe common accused at each trial. The composition of his co-\naccused differed number-wise and identity-wise from trial to\ntrial At the conclusion of the series of trials, the accused\nfound guilty  were convicted  under appropriate\t provisions.\nFour of\t them were  awarded death sentence, whereas sentence\nof imprisonment\t for life  was imposed on nine of them. They\nwere also  convicted for  different offences and appropriate\npunishment was inflicted on each of them in that behalf. The\norder of  conviction and  sentence gave\t rise to five murder\nreferences and\tfourteen appeals  by the convicts before the\nHigh Court  of Punjab and Haryana. Having lost their appeals\nand  the   death  sentences   having  been  con-firmed,\t the\nappellants have come in appeal by way of special leave.\n     The Court considered the following:\n     (a) What  normal guidelines are to be followed so as to\nidentify the  &quot;rarest of  rare cases&quot;  formula for  imposing\ndeath sentence,\t as spelled  out in Bachan Singh v. State of\nPunjab, [1980]\t2 SCR  864; (b) Reliability of eye witnesses\nto a  crime under  light shed by the lantern in a village to\nidentify connect  an accused to the crime; (c) invocation of\nthe doctrine of benefit of doubt;\n414\nand (d)\t the effect  of\t non-summoning\tthe  magistrate\t for\nrecording dying declaration.\n     Allowing the  Criminal Appeals Nos. 79/81 and 86/81 and\ndismissing the other appeals, the Court\n^\n     HELD :  1:1. The  extreme penalty\tof death need not be\ninflicted except  in gravest  cases of\textreme culpability.\nBefore opting for the death penalty the circumstances of the\n&#x27;offender&#x27; also\t require  to  be  taken\t into  consideration\nalongwith   the\t  circumstances\t  of   the   &#x27;crime&#x27;.\tLife\nimprisonment is the rule and death sentence is an exception.\nIn other words death sentence must be imposed only when life\nimprisonment  appears\tto  be\t an  altogether\t  inadequate\npunishment having  regard to  the relevant  circumstances of\nthe crime,  and provided,  and only  provided, the option to\nimpose\tsentence   of  imprisonment   for  life\t  cannot  be\nconscientiously exercised  having regard  to the  nature and\ncircumstances  of   the\t  crime\t  and\tall   the   relevant\ncircumstances. A balance sheet of aggravating and mitigating\ncircumstances has  to be  drawn\t up  and  in  doing  so\t the\nmitigating circumstances  has to  be accorded full weightage\nand a  just balance has to be struck between the aggravating\nand  the  mitigating  circumstances  before  the  option  is\nexercised. [433 A-E]\n     Bachan Singh  v. State  of Punjab\t[1980] 2 S.C.C. 684,\nrelied on,\n     1;2. In  order to apply these guidelines inter-alia the\nfollowing questions  may be asked and answers : (a) Is there\nsomething uncommon about the crime which renders sentence of\nimprisonment for  life inadequate  and called  for  a  death\nsentence ?  (b) Are the circumstances of the crime such that\nthere is  no alternative  but to  impose death sentence even\nafter  according   maximum  weightage\tto  the\t  mitigating\ncircumstances which speak in favour of the offender. [433 E-\nG]\n     1:3. If  upon taking  an overall global view of all the\ncircumstances in  the light of the aforesaid proposition and\ntaking into  account the answers to the questions posed here\nin above,  the circumstances of the case are such that death\nsentence is  warranted, the  court would  proceed to  do so.\n[433 G-H]\n     2. The  villagers living  in villages where electricity\nhas not\t reached as  yet, get accustomed to seeing things in\nthe  light   shed  by\tthe  lantern.  Their  eyesight\tgets\nconditioned and\t becomes accustomed  to the situation. Their\npowers\tof  seeing  are\t therefore  not\t diminished  by\t the\ncircumstance that  the incident\t is witnessed  in the  light\nshed by the lantern and not electric light. Paucity of light\ncannot, therefore,  improbablise the commission of the crime\nby the accused. [417 C-D]\n     3:1. When\ta piece\t of evidence  introduced and  relied\nupon by the prosecution itself creates a doubt (a reasonable\ndoubt) as  regards the\tcomplicity of  the accused,  even if\nthere are  no infirmities in other evidence, the doctrine of\nbenefit of  doubt must\tbe invoked by the court in favour of\nthe accused. [422 F-G]\n415\n     In the  instant case,  though there  is no infirmity in\nthe evidence  of PW  Amar Singh\t and PW\t Mohindo to  connect\nMohinder Singh\tto the crime, the fact that the second rifle\nused in\t the commission\t of  crime  having  been  originally\nissued\tto   one  Kashmir   Singh  does\t not  satisfactorily\nestablish the link.\n\t\t\t\t\t\t[422 B, E-F]\n     3:2. When\tthe deceased  was making  good recovery\t and\nhaving regard  to the  condition of his health, no danger to\nhis  life   was\t apprehended  and  therefore  in  that\tfact\nsituation, the\tmagistrate was\tnot summoned,  no fault\t can\nlegitimately be\t found on this score for getting the benefit\nof doubt in favour of the accused. Any statement made to the\npolice by  such deceased  can be  subsequently allowed to be\ntreated as dying declaration and evidence scanned.

The criticism\nis this.  It was  a dark  night.  Electricity  had  not\t yet\nreached the  concerned village at the material time. In each\ncrime the  appreciation of evidence regarding identification\nhas to\tbe made\t in the context of the fact-situation that a\nlighted lantern\t was hanging  in the  court-yard  where\t the\nvictims were  sleeping on  the cots.  The light\t shed by the\nlantern cannot\tbe considered  to be sufficient enough (such\nis the argument) to enable the eye witnesses to identify the\nculprits. This\targument has  been rightly  rebuffed by\t the\nSessions Court\tand the\t High  Court,  on  the\tground\tthat\nvillagers living  in  villages\twhere  electricity  has\t not\nreached as yet, get accustomed to seeing things in the light\nshed by\t the lantern.  Their eyesight  gets conditioned\t and\nbecomes accustomed  to the situation. Their powers of seeing\nare therefore  not diminished  by the  circumstance that the\nincident is  witnessed in  the light shed by the lantern and\nnot electric  light. Moreover,\tidentification did  not pose\nany serious  problem  as  the  accused\twere  known  to\t the\nwitnesses. In  fact they  were embroiled  in a long standing\nfamily feud.  As the culprits had not covered their faces to\nconceal their  identity. it  was not  difficult to  identify\nthem from  their facial features, build gait etc. Light shed\nby the\tlantern\t was  enough  to  enable  the  witnesses  to\nidentify the culprits under the circumstances.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">     The concurrent finding of fact recorded by the Sessions\nCourt and the High Court in this behalf does not, therefore,\ncall for  interference at  the hands  of this  Court on this\nscore.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     Now we  will address  ourselves to the facts pertaining\nto the individual appeals.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">CRIME No. 1.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">     The  occurrence   giving  rise   to   the\t proceedings\nculminating in\tthe appeal  before this\t Court took place at\nVillage Alahi  Baksh Badla  at about 8.30 p.m. on August 12,\n1977. Four  members of the household of PW Amar Singh became\nthe target  of the  assailants and  lost their\tlives in the\ncourse of  the murderous  attack. The  four victims were the\nwife and  three sons  of PW  Amar Singh\t viz., (1) Biban Bai\n(aged about  45); (2)  Gurcharan Singh\t(aged about 15); (3)\nJagtar Singh  (aged about  10) and  (4) Balwant\t Singh (aged\nabout 9). As luck would have it Amar Singh the head of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">418</span>\nhousehold and his 10 years old daughter, PW Mohindo, escaped\nthe murderous  assault and  survived to tell the tale of the\nghastly murder in the Court. Evidence of PW Amar Singh shows\nthat on\t the unfortunate  night, he  and the  members of the\nhousehold were\tsleeping  in  the  courtyard.  There  was  a\nlighted lantern\t in the\t courtyard which  was placed  on the\nsmall boundary\twall of\t the kitchen.  P.W. Amar  Singh\t was\nsleeping on  one cot.  PW Mohindo, his daughter who survived\nthe attack,  was also  sleeping in the same cot. Next to him\nwas another  cot on  which his\twife Biban Bai was sleeping.\nAnd an\tinfant child  was sleeping with her on the same cot.\nHis two\t sons,\tGurcharan  Singh  and  Kulwant\tSingh,\twere\nsleeping together  on another  cot just\t nearby.  P.W.\tAmar\nSingh suddenly\twoke up\t on hearing the noise of the barking\nof a  dog since he was half awake being apprehensive of some\ntrouble because\t of a  murder case  which was  pending in  a\ncriminal court\tagainst his  relations. Amar Singh sprang up\non hearing  the noise  and instinctively  went inside, where\nsome sarkana reeds were heaped, and concealed himself there.\nHe was\tpeeping from his place of hiding and was able to see\nwhat was happening. Barely had he done so when he espied the\nfive appellants, who were known to him, enter the courtyard.\nAppellant Machhi  Singh and  appellant Mohinder\t Singh\twere\neach armed  with  a  rifle.  Their  three  companions  viz.,\nAppellant Bhajan  Singh, Kashmir  Singh, and,  Chinna Singh,\nwere armed with kirpans. Appellant Machhi Singh fired a shot\nat Biban  Bai, who  was lying  on the  cot. At the same time\nappellant Mohinder  Singh fired\t a shot at Balwant Singh who\nwas lying  on a\t cot.  Appellant  Machhi  Singh\t then  fired\nanother shot at Jagtar Singh and yet another shot at Kulwant\nSingh. Appellant  Mohinder Singh on his part fired a shot at\nGurucharan Singh.  It is the version of P.W. Amar Singh that\nhis daughter  P.W. Mohindo managed to get beneath the cot on\nwhich he  was previously  lying while  the  assailants\twere\nfiring at  the different  victims. The\tthree companions  of\nappellants Machhi Singh and Mohinder Singh, namely, Kashimir\nSingh, Chinna  Singh, and,  Bhajan Singh,  gave kirpan blows\nwhich were  aimed at  the head\tof Biban Bai who had already\nbeen injured  by rifle\tshots. The kirpan blows did not fall\non the head of Biban Bai but struck the upper surface of the\ntable which  was  lying\t nearby.  Thereafter  all  the\tfive\nculprits fled  from there  with\t their\trespective  weapons.\nAfter day  break PW  Amar Singh\t left the  house in order to\nlodge a report of the occurrence with P.W. 31 Head Constable\nWassan Singh.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">419</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     Seven persons  were prosecuted  in connection with this\nincident. Five\tof them have been acquitted. Only two of the\noriginal seven\taccused, viz.,\tAppellants Machhi  Singh and\nMohinder Singh\thave been convicted for murder and sentenced\nto death.  We propose  to deal with the appeals preferred by\nthem separately.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">Appellant Machhi Singh:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">     As far  as Machhi\tSingh is  concerned the\t finding  of\nguilt recorded by the Session Court and affirmed by the High\nCourt rests on the testimony of two eye witnesses viz., P.W.\nAmar Singh  and his  10\t year  old  daughter  P.W.  Mohindo.\nEvidence has  also been adduced to establish that one of the\nrifles used  in the course of the murderous assault had been\nissued to  Machhi Singh\t in his\t capacity as  an officer  of\nPunjab Homeguards.  The evidence  of  the  ballistic  expert\nestablishes that  the said  rifle had been recently used and\nsome of\t the empty  cartridges found  from the\tscene of the\noccurrence were\t fired from  this rifle.  This\tevidence  is\nfurther corroborated  by  the  evidence\t pertaining  to\t the\nrecovery of  the rifle\tat the\tinstance of appellant Machhi\nSingh which  has been accepted by the Sessions Court and the\nHigh Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">     Learned Counsel  for the  appellant contended  that the\nevidence of  the two  eye witnesses  namely, P.W. Amar Singh\nand P.W.  Mohindo was  not such as could be implicity relied\nupon, and  the rest  of the evidence was neither sufficient,\nnor  satisfactory   enough,  to\t bring\thome  the  guilt  to\nappellant Machhi Singh.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">     The Sessions  Court and  High Court  have accepted\t the\nevidence of  P.W. Amar\tSingh and  his daughter P.W. Mohindo\nafter close  and careful  scrutiny of  the same.  We do\t not\nthink that  there is  any justification\t to take a different\nview in\t regard to  the assessment  of their  evidence.\t The\npresence of Amar Singh and his daughter Mohindo at the scene\nof occurrence  is natural  inasmuch as\tthe occurrence\ttook\nplace at  the house of Amar Singh. Counsel for the appellant\nhas assailed  the finding recorded by the Sessions Court and\naffirmed by  the High  Court by\t pressing into\tservice\t the\nargument that  as there\t was only one lantern burning in the\ncourtyard, and as it was a dark night, it being the 14th day\nof the\tsecond half  of the  lunar  month,  Amar  Singh\t and\nMohindo could  not have\t identified the\t culprits. It  is no\ndoubt true  that it  was a  night preceding the &#x27;amavashya&#x27;.\nAll the\t same the  evidence clearly  shows that\t a lamp\t was\nburning in the courtyard. This aspect has already been dealt\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">420</span>\nwith a\tshort while  ago. For  the reasons  indicated in the\ncourse\tof   the  earlier   discussion\twe  think  that\t the\nconcurrent view\t taken by  the Sessions\t Court and  the High\nCourt  that   there  was  sufficient  light  to\t enable\t the\nidentification of the culprits must be affirmed. Besides, it\nis a  pure question of appreciation of evidence which cannot\nbe reagitated  before us.  Even so we have considered on our\nown the\t evidence on the point and we are satisfied that the\nview taken  by the  Sessions Court  and the  High  Court  is\nunexceptionable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">     Counsel for  the  appellant  next\tcontended  that\t the\nevidence pertaining  to the  recovery of  the rifle  and the\nevidence adduced  by the  prosecution in  order to establish\nthat one  of the rifles used in the course of the occurrence\nwas issued  to appellant  Machhi Singh in his capacity as an\nofficer of  the Punjab\tHomeguards was\tnot satisfactory and\nreliable.  The\tSessions  Court\t and  the  High\t Court\thave\naccepted the prosecution evidence in this behalf. We have on\nour own\t perused the  evidence\tand  we\t see  no  reason  to\ndisbelieve the\tevidence connecting  appellant Machhi  Singh\nwith the  weapon of offence (Ex. P-18). The evidence of P.W.\n15 Shri\t Yashpal, Platoon  Commander of Punjab Homeguard, is\nsupported by  entry Ex\t32/A in the Register relating to the\nissuance of  arms and  ammunitions to  the volunteers of the\nHomeguards. The\t evidence of P.W. 32 Narinder Singh, Quarter\nMaster of  Punjab Homeguards,  conclusively establishes that\nthe rifle was issued to appellant Machhi Singh. The evidence\nshows that appellant was personally known to the witness. He\nalso identified\t the signature\tof appellant Machhi Singh at\npoint marked  &#x27;B&#x27;. It may be mentioned that in the course of\nhis statement  under  <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_4\">Sec.  313</a>\t of  the  Code\tof  Criminal\nProcedure,  appellant\tMachhi\tSingh\tadmitted  that\t the\nsignature at  Ex. P.W.\t32 A  was his  signature.  Of-course\naccording to him the said signature had been obtained by the\npolice under coercion. Unless we hold that the Investigating\nOfficer and  the Officers of the Homeguards had entered into\na conspiracy  to concoct evidence against Machhi Singh, this\nevidence cannot be disbelieved. There is no warrant for such\nan assumption.\tTheir evidence is otherwise flawless and has\nremained unshaken.  We therefore see no reason to disbelieve\nthe testimony of P.W. 32 (Quarter Master Narendra Singh) and\nP.W. 15\t (Platoon Commander Yashpal). On a close and careful\nscrutiny of  the evidence  on this point the Session&#x27;s Court\nand the\t High Court  have rightly  reached the conclusion to\nthe effect  that rifle\tEx. P.18  was  issued  to  appellant\nMachhi Singh  in his  capacity as  a member  of\t the  Punjab\nHomeguards on  February 12, 1977 and that the said rifle and\nthe ammunition had remained with appellant Machhi Singh ever\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">421</span>\nsince. On  a close scrutiny of the evidence on this point is\nunassailable and  the view  taken by  the Sessions Court and\nthe High  Court is unimpeachable. The rifle in question, Ex.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">P-18, and  some live  cartridges were recovered in pursuance\nof a  statement made by appellant Machhi Singh. The evidence\nof P.W. 18 shows that the statement leading to the discovery\nof the\taforesaid weapon was made by appellant Machhi Singh.\nThe evidence  also shows that appellant Machhi Singh led the\npolice party  which was accompanied by independent witnesses\nto the\tplace from  where rifle Ex. P-18 and live cartridges\nwere recovered.\t The Sessions  Court and the High Court have\naccepted this  evidence and  we do  not see  any  reason  to\ndisbelieve the\tsame. Thus  the evidence  clearly shows that\nappellant Machhi  Singh had  used the  rifle by\t which shots\nwere  fired   at  the  victims\tand  that  he  was  directly\nresponsible for\t the killings.\tThe order  of conviction  is\ntherefore unassailable\tand must  be confirmed. We will deal\nwith the  question  of\tsentence  at  the  fag\tend  of\t the\njudgment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">Appellant Mohinder Singh:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">     So far  as appellant  Mohinder Singh  is concerned\t the\nevidence connecting him with the crime falls into two parts.\nThe first  part of  the evidence consists of the evidence of\nP.W.  Amar  Singh  and\tP.W.  Mohindo.\tBoth  of  them\thave\nimplicated appellant  Mohinder Singh, appellant Machhi Singh\n(whose case  we have  discussed a moment ago), and the other\nthree appellants.  The criticism  levelled in the context of\nappellant Machhi  Singh has  been repeated in the context of\nthe evidence  connecting appellant  Mohinder Singh  with the\ncrime. We  have already\t evaluated the evidence of these two\neye witnesses.\tWe need\t not therefore\treiterate  the\tsame\nreasoning in  the context  of appellant\t Mohinder Singh\t for\nrepelling the criticism on this score.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">     The second\t part of  the  evidence\t connects  appellant\nMohinder Singh\twith the  second rifle which was used in the\ncourse of  the commission  of the  crime. The Sessions Court\nand the\t High Court have accepted the evidence on both these\npoints.\t Counsel   for\tthe  appellant\thas  challenged\t the\nvalidity of  the finding  recorded by the Sessions Court and\nthe High  Court on these two points. In our opinion the most\nimportant evidence  from this  stand point  is the  evidence\nadduced by  the\t prosecution  in  order\t to  establish\tthat\nappellant Mohinder  Singh was in possession of the weapon of\noffence namely,\t the second  rifle which  was  used  by\t the\nculprits. Counsel  is  right  in  his  submission  that\t the\nevidence on this point does not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">422</span>\nsatisfactorily establish  the link.  In\t fact  the  evidence\nshows that  the second\trifle used  in the commission of the\ncrime was  originally issued  to one  Kashmir Singh.  Thus a\ndoubt is  created in  regard to\t the identity of the culprit\nwho fired the second rifle.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">     Admittedly, the  weapon in\t question was  not issued to\nappellant Mohinder  Singh. The\tweapon alongwith  ammunition\n(20 rounds)  was originally  issued to P.W. 27 Kashmir Singh\nby Punjab  Homeguards `B&#x27;  Company on 16th October 1974. The\nofficial records  evidence this\t fact. There is no record to\nshow that  this rifle was returned by PW 27. The evidence PW\n27 that one Kaka Ram, a Platoon Commander of Homeguards, had\ntaken back  the rifle and the ammunition from him and handed\nover the  same to appellant Mohinder Singh a few days before\n13th  April   1977  in\tthe  presence  of  PW  27  has\tbeen\ndisbelieved by\tthe Sessions  Court. The  High Court has not\ngiven any  convincing reason  to justify  taking a different\nview. Thus  the link  between  the  weapon  of\toffence\t and\nappellant Mohinder  Singh is  not established.\tIn fact\t the\nevidence shows\tthat it\t was issued  to PW  27 some  3 years\nbefore the  occurrence. Even  if the prosecution evidence is\naccepted at  its face  value it\t does not establish that the\nweapon was  with appellant  Mohinder Singh  at any  point of\ntime proximate\tto the\tpoint of  time of the offence. Under\nthe circumstances we are unable to agree with the High Court\nthat appellant\tMohinder Singh\twas  in\t possession  of\t the\nweapon of  offence at  the point  of time of the offence. In\nview of\t this lacuna  in the  evidence we are unable to hold\nthat the  second rifle\twhich was  used in the commission of\nthe crime was fired by appellant Mohinder Singh.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_6\">     This dimension  gives rise\t to a  dilemma. A  piece  of\nevidence introduced  and  relied  upon\tby  the\t prosecution\nitself creates\ta doubt\t (a reasonable doubt) as regards the\ncomplicity of  the appellant.  Though  we  do  not  see\t any\ninfirmity in  the evidence of PW Amar Singh, and PW Mohindo,\nin view\t of this  factor, which\t speaks\t in  favour  of\t the\nappellant, we  must invoke the doctrine of benefit of doubt.\nWe accordingly\taccord the  benefit of\treasonable doubt  to\nAppellant  Mohinder  Singh.  The  order\t of  conviction\t and\nsentence, in so far as he is concerned must therefore be set\naside. We  accordingly acquit  Appellant Mohinder  Singh and\ndirect that  he be  set at  liberty forthwith  unless he  is\nrequired to be detained in the context of some other order.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">423</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">Crime No. II A &amp; II B:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">\t\t\t    II A\n     At about  9-10 p.m.  on August  12\t 1977  nine  persons\nintruded in  the house\tof one Kahar Singh at village Sowaya\nRai armed  with deadly weapons including rifles, pistols and\nkirpans. They  killed two  inmates of  the  household  (Smt.\nGhamobai and  Smt. Rajobai)  and injured the third one (Smt.\nNankobai) by gun shots.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">\t\t\t    II B\n     From there, they straightway proceeded to a place known\nas &#x27;Kho\t Kunjuka&#x27;  situated  at\t a  distance  of  about\t two\nfurlongs from  the said village. They forcibly intruded into\nthe house  of one Bishan Singh. They attacked the inmates of\nthe house  and killed Bishan Singh, Smt. Paro, and her child\nBalbir Singh,  by firing  rifle shots. PW. 2 Hakam Singh was\nlying on  a cot\t outside the compound of the house of Bishan\nSingh. He  was apprehensive of his life and fled from there.\nTwo of\tthe culprits  viz., Machhi  Singh, and\tJagir Singh,\nchased him and fired at him. As a result of this Hakam Singh\nsustained gun shot injuries.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">     In connection  with these\ttwo incidents the appellants\nwere tried  by the  Sessions Court for various offences. The\nSessions Court convicted the appellants for an offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_5\">Sec. 302</a>  I.P.C. read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_6\">Sec. 149</a> I.P.C. as in its view it\nwas  established  beyond  reasonable  doubt  that  the\tnine\nappellants had\tformed an  unlawful assembly with the common\nobject of  committing murder of Smt. Ghamobai, Smt. Rajobai,\nSmt. Parobai  and Balbir  Singh. The  appellants  were\talso\nfound guilty  of an  attempt to\t commit the  murder of PW 20\nNankobai, and,\tPW 22 Hakam Singh, who sustained injuries by\ngun shots in the course of these incidents, but who survived\nthe  murderous\tassaults  to  narrate  the  version  of\t the\nincident before\t the Court. The Sessions Court imposed death\npenalty on  three of  the appellants,  viz.,  Machhi  Singh,\nKashmir Singh,\tand Jagir  Singh.  The\tremaining  six\twere\nsentenced to  undergo imprisonment  for life. The High Court\nconfirmed the order of conviction and sentence and dismissed\nthe appeals preferred by the appellants.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">\t\t\t    II A\n     So\t far   as  the\t first\tincident  is  concerned\t the\nconviction of the appellants rests on the testimony of three\nwitnesses viz,,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">424</span>\nPW 16  Kaka Ram,  PW  21  Bagicha  Singh,  and\tPW  20\tSmt.\nNankobai. Out  of these\t three witnesses, the evidence of PW\n20 Nankobai  is of  great significance\tinasmuch as  she had\nherself sustained  an injury  by gun  short on her head. The\nfact that  Smt. Nankobai  sustained gun\t shot injury  in the\ncourse of  this transaction is satisfactorily established by\nthe medical  evidence. Now  PW\t20  was\t an  inmate  of\t the\nHousehold of  Kehar Singh.  Her presence  at the  house\t was\ntherefore natural.  The\t medical  evidence  therefore  fully\ncorroborates and  lends support\t to her version that she was\none of\tthe inmates of the household, and was present at the\nscence of  offence. Her\t presence at the time of the offence\ncannot therefore  be disputed.\tShe being an injured witness\nher evidence  is entitled  to great  weight. There  is an in\nbuilt guarantee that she was an eye witness to the incident.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">Her evidence  convincingly establishes\tthat the  appellants\nwere the  persons who  had intruded  in the  house of  Kehar\nSingh and committed the crime resulting in the death of Smt.\nGamobai and  Smt. Rajobai,  both of  whom succumbed  to\t the\ninjuries  inflicted   on   them.   Her\t testimony   further\nestablishes that  she herself was injured by the rifle shots\nin the course of the incident by appellant Kashmir Singh. It\nwas a matter of sheer luck that PW 20 did not succumb to the\ninjuries and  survived to  till the tale. There is no reason\nto doubt  or disbelieve\t her testimony.\t It is no doubt true\nthat she  had remained\tunconscious for\t five  or  six\tdays\nbefore she  regained consciousness at the hospital. But then\nher evidence clearly shows that she had sustained the injury\nonly after  Smt. Gamobai, and Smt. Rajobai were shot dead by\nthe assailants.\t It was\t only after she sustained the injury\nthat she  became unconscious.  Her  evidence  that  she\t had\nwitnessed the  murderous assault  on Smt.  Gamobai  and\t Sm.\nRajobai and  had  identified  the  assailants  has  remained\nunshaken and has been accepted by the Sessions Court and the\nHigh Court.  There is  no valid\t reason to  take a different\nview. The  argument about insufficiency of light has already\nbeen  negatived.   The\tevidence   of  PW  20  is  therefore\nsufficient to uphold the order of conviction recorded by the\ncourts below.  Furthermore, there  is the evidence of PW 16,\nKaka Ram,  and PW  21, Bagicha Singh. PW 16 occupies a house\nin the neighborhood. He came out from the house upon hearing\nthe report  of fun  fire. He  was standing outside the house\nand had\t witnessed  the\t incident.  He\thad  identified\t the\nappellants as the culprits. His evidence is reinforced by PW\n21 Bagicha  Singh who  was  sleeping  on  the  roof  of\t the\nadjoining house.  He had  also witnessed  the  incident\t and\nidentified the assailants. They are not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">425</span>\nshown to  be interested witnesses who would concoct a story.\nWhy  should  they  do  so  ?  In  fact\tthey  were  exposing\nthemselves   to\t  considerable\t risk.\t On   probabilities,\ntherefore, it is least likely that these two witnesses would\nfalsely implicate  the appellants.  Their evidence  has been\naccepted by the Sessions Court and the High Court. We see no\nreason to do otherwise, The finding of guilt recorded by the\nSessions Court and the High Court in regard to this incident\nmust therefore be unhesitatingly confirmed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">\t\t\t   (II B)\n     In-so-far as the second incident is concerned, the most\nimportant witness  is PW  22 Hakam  Singh,  inasmuch  as  he\nhimself had  sustained injuries by gun shot in the course of\nthe incident  in question That he was present at the time of\nthe occurrence\tand had\t witnessed the incident is therefore\nincapable of being disputed. It is difficult to believe that\nPW 22  who was\thimself chased\tby the\tassailants  and\t was\ninjured by  gun shots would implicate persons other than the\nreal culprits.\tHis evidence  further shows  that two of the\nculprits viz.,\tappellant Machhi  Singh and  appellant Jagir\nSingh had chased him and fired the shots at him which caused\ninjuries to  him. The  medical evidence\t fully supports\t his\ntestimony and  establishes that\t he had\t sustained gun\tshot\ninjuries in  the course\t of this  incident. The\t evidence of\nthis witness  alone is sufficient to bring home the guilt to\nthe  appellants,   even\t if   one  were\t  to  exclude\tfrom\nconsideration the  evidence of\tPW 16  Kaka Ram\t and  PW  21\nBagicha Singh.\tThere is  however, no reasons to do so. Both\nof them\t have testified\t on oath that they had witnessed the\nincident. They\tare not\t shown to  be  interested  witnesses\nthere is  no reason  why they  should falsely  implicate the\nappellants and expose themselves to the obvious risk arising\ntherefrom. The\tSessions  Court\t and  the  High\t Court\twere\nperfectly  justified   in  accepting  and  acting  upon\t the\ntestimony  of  these  two  witnesses  whose  evidence  lends\nfurther strength  and support to the evidence of the injured\nwitness viz.,  PW 22  Hakam Singh.  The stock criticism that\nthe culprits  could not have been identified in the light of\nthe lantern  which was hanging in the courtyard, has already\nbeen dealt  with and  repelled\tearlier.  We  are  therefore\nunable to  accede to  the argument  advanced by\t the learned\ncounsel for  the appellants.  The finding  of guilt  and the\norder of  conviction must therefore be confirmed. As regards\nsentence, the  sentence of  imprisonment of  life imposed on\nsix of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">426</span>\nappellants and\tthe other  sentences imposed on them have to\nbe  consequently   confirmed.  Their   appeals\twill   stand\ndismissed. So  far as appellants Machhi Singh, Kashmir Singh\nand Jagir  Singh  are  concerned,  the\tSessions  Court\t has\nimposed death  sentence on  each of them. The High Court has\nconfirmed it. On our part, we will deal with the question of\nsentence imposed  on them  in the  concluding  part  of\t our\njudgment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">Crime No. III\n     One Wanjar\t Singh (65)  and his  grand son Satnam Singh\n(16) were killed by gun shots in the course of this incident\nat the\thouse of Wanjar Singh in village Mamujoa at about 11\np.m. on the night of August 12, 1977. The only inmate of the\nhouse who  escaped was PW 16 Smt. Sabban, the wife of Wanjar\nSingh who was narrated her story in the following manner:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">     She was  sleeping in  the courtyard  of her  house.  At\nabout 11  p.m. she  woke up  and saw  appellant Machhi Singh\narmed with  rifle, and\this two\t brothers, appellant  Chhina\nSingh and  appellant  Kashmir  Singh,  armed  with  Kirpans,\nstanding near  the feet\t of Satnam Singh who was sleeping on\nthe cot. These three were accompanied by Appellants Mohinder\nSingh and  Bhajan Singh\t who were  armed with  rifle  and  a\nkirpan respectively. Appellant Kashmir Singh flashed a torch\nat Satnam  Singh. Thereupon appellant Machhi Singh fired two\nshots both  of which  hit Satnam Singh. Mohinder Singh fired\ntwo shots  at her husband Wanjar Singh who was sleeping on a\ncot nearby. Wanjar Singh and her grand-son Satnam Singh died\non the spot on their cots. She shouted for help and began to\ncry. The  Appellants, who  were about to leave, turned back.\nAppellant Machhi  Singh fired a shot at her which missed her\nbut hit her bullock (which was tied in the courtyard) on its\nright leg.  The witness\t raised an alarm and cried for help.\nBut no\tone came  during the night. At dawn Chowkidar Sardar\nRam came  to the  spot. She requested him to remain near the\ndead bodies. She herself proceeded to police-station Gur Mar\nSahay and lodged F.I.R. Ex. PW 10/B.\n     The presence  of Smt.  Sabhan at her own house at night\ntime is but natural. Her husband and her grand-son have been\nkilled. She  is the  lone survivor  of\tthe  household.\t Her\nevidence  therefore   assumes  great   importance.   It\t  is\ninconceivable that the witness, who\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">427</span>\nhas lost her husband, as also her grand son, would implicate\npersons other  than the\t real culprits.\t The  only  argument\npressed\t into  service\twas  the  stock\t argument  regarding\ninsufficiency of  light. It  was  negatived  by\t the  courts\nbelow.\tWe  have  already  dealt  with\tand  negatived\tthis\nargument  for\treasons\t indicated   earlier.  Her  evidence\nfurthermore shows  that appellant  Kashmir Singh had flashed\nhis torch at her husband (Wanjar Singh) and at her grand-son\n(Satnam Singh).\t That she herself remained alive to tell the\ntale was  a stroke  of luck.  The appellants had shot at her\nbut the\t rifle shot  hit the bullock instead of hitting her.\nThe culprits  were naturally,  in a  hurry to get away. They\nwould not  have waited to ascertain whether she was hit. Her\nevidence remains unshaken. The Courts below have, therefore,\nrightly considered  it to be creditworthy and safe for being\nacted upon.  And yet with regard to appellant Mohinder Singh\nwho is\talleged to  have used  the second  rifle, the matter\nstands\ton   a\tsomewhat  different  footing.  The  evidence\nconnecting the\tappellant with\tthe rifle in question in the\npresent\t case  is  the\tvery  same  evidence  that  we\thave\ndisbelieved in\tthe context of crime No. 1. Official records\nshow, and it is the case of the prosecution itself, that the\nrifle was  issued to  PW 15  Kashmir Singh  on 16th  October\n1974. The  evidence adduced  in order  to show\tthat it\t was\ntaken back and handed over to appellant Mohinder Singh a few\ndays before  13th April 1977 does not inspire confidence. We\nagree with  the reasoning of the Sessions Court. We need not\nrepeat the  reasons which  we have set out at some length in\nthe course  of discussion pertaining to crime No. 1. Suffice\nit to  say that the doctrine of benefit of doubt requires to\nbe invoked  on the  facts of this case. We accordingly allow\nthe appeal  of\tMohinder  Singh,  set  aside  the  order  of\nconviction and\tsentence passed against him, and direct that\nhe be  set at  liberty forthwith unless he is required to be\ndetained in some other connection.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">     In so  far as the rest of the appellants are concerned,\nthe evidence  of this  witness has  been accepted  and acted\nupon by the Sessions Court and the High Court, and we do not\nsee any\t reason to do otherwise. Under the circumstances the\nfinding of guilt recorded by the Sessions Court and the High\nCourt for the aforesaid offence against the other appellants\nmust be\t confirmed. Turning  to the  question of sentence, a\ndeath sentence\thas been  imposed on  Machhi Singh.  We will\nconsider the question as to whether death sentence is called\nfor in the concluding part of our judgment. In so far as the\nrest of the appellants are concerned, the sentence of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">428</span>\nimprisonment for life and the other sentence imposed on each\nof them\t must be  confirmed. Their  appeals  will  therefore\nstand dismissed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">Crime No. IV\n     The incident  occurred at\tVillage Kamrewala at about 1\na.m. on\t the night between 12th August and 13th August 1977.\nMohinder Singh,\t aged about  32, the  brother of Amar Singh,\nwas shot  dead. The F.I.R. was lodged within half an hour at\nabout 1.30  a.m. by Piaro Bai wife of victim Mohinder Singh.\nThe evidence  of Piaro Bai shows that one Jaggar Singh was a\nguest at  their house  on that\tnight. Her  husband Mohinder\nSingh was sleeping on one cot. The guest, PW 4 Jaggar Singh,\nwas sleeping  on another cot nearby him. The witness herself\nwas sleeping  on a  cot alongwith  her two  children in\t the\ncourtyard. A  lighted lantern  was hanging  on a  peg on the\nwall. At about 1 a.m. someone from outside the house shouted\nfor her\t husband. She  woke him up and told him about it Her\nhusband was  in the  process of\t sitting up  on the cot when\nfive persons  intruded into  the courtyard.  Only one of the\nfive  intruders\t  (Machhi  Singh)  was\tknown  to  her.\t The\nremaining four\twere not known to her, One of them was armed\nwith a rifle and the rest were armed with kirpans. Appellant\nMachhi Singh  fired a  rifle shot which hit her husband near\nthe shoulder.  Her husband  succumbed to  the injury  on the\nspot. The  culprits thereafter left the house. She proceeded\nto the\tpolice station at Jalalabad accompanied by PW Harnam\nSingh and lodged the F.I.R. at 1.30 a.m.\n     The evidence of PW 2 Piaro Bai and PW 4 Jaggar Singh is\nreliable and  trustworthy and  can be  safely acted  upon in\norder to  bring home  guilt to\tAppellant Machhi  Singh. Her\npresence at  her own house at night time is but natural. The\nevidence of PW 4 Jaggar Singh also corroborates the evidence\nregarding her  presence and  the occurrence.  PW 2  has\t not\nimplicated by  name anyone other than Appellant Machhi Singh\nin her\tF.I.R. Her  evidence  is  to  the  effect  that\t the\ncompanions of  appellant Machhi Singh were not known to her.\nThis shows  that she  is a  conscientious witness. The usual\nargument regarding  inadequacy of light must be rejected for\nthe reasons  indicated earlier.\t In this case the F.I.R. was\nlodged within  half an\thour of the occurrence. The evidence\nof PW  4 who was a guest at the house fully corroborates the\ntestimony of PW 2. The evidence shows that his statement was\nrecorded at  4 o&#x27;clock\tin the\tnight, that is to say within\nthree hours of the occurrence. His\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">429</span>\nevidence also  shows that  appellant Machhi  Singh had fired\nthe rifle  shot. This evidence has been rightly accepted and\nacted upon  by the Sessions Court and the High Court. We see\nno reason  to dislodge\tthis concurrent\t finding of fact. We\nmust therefore\tconfirm the finding of guilt recorded by the\nSessions Court\tas affirmed  by the  High Court in so far as\nappellant Machhi  Singh is  concerned. We will deal with the\nquestion of sentence at a subsequent stage.\nCrime No. V.\n     At about  3.30 a.m.  on the night between August 12 and\nAugust 13,  1977 five  miscreants armed\t with deadly weapons\neffected forcible  entry in the house of one Ujagar Singh at\nvillage Dandi Khur. They attacked the inmates and killed his\nsister Palobai,\t 35, and four near relatives of Palibai viz:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">(1) her father-in-law Sahib Singh, 70, (2) her mother-in-law\nMattobai, 60,  (3) her husband Jit Singh, 35, (4) last named\nJit Singh&#x27;s  cousin Mukhtiar  Singh, 25.  Out of  these five\nvictims, three\tdied on\t the spot,  whereas, two  viz: Sahib\nSingh and Mukhtiar Singh, sustained rifle shot injuries, and\ndied at the hospital some five days later on August 16, 1977\nand August  18, 1977  respectively. The incident occurred at\nabout 3.30.  a.m. and the F.I.R. was lodged within about six\nhours at 9.30 a.m. by PW 37 Ujagar Singh.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">     The order\tof conviction  (passed by the Sessions Court\nand affirmed  by the  High Court) is inter-alia based on the\ndying declaration  of Mukhtiar\tSingh. He  was fired  at and\ninjured soon  after midnight  in the early morning of August\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">13. He\twas removed to hospital on that very day. His police\nstatement (which  has been  subsequently treated  as a dying\ndeclaration) was  recorded on the 16th i.e. three days after\nthe assault.  He died  on the  18th,  two  days\t later.\t The\nevidence shows\tthat he\t was in\t fit  condition\t to  make  a\nstatement  and\t his  statement\t was  truly  and  faithfully\nrecorded. His  statement has  been considered  to be genuine\nand true by the Sessions Court and the High Court. We are of\nthe same  opinion. It is true that the dying declaration has\nnot been  recorded by  a magistrate.  But then\tthe evidence\nshows that  Mukhtiar Singh  was\t making\t good  recovery\t and\nhaving regard  to the  condition of his health, no danger to\nhis life  was apprehended.  It was  in this situation that a\nmagistrate  was\t  not  summoned.   Thus,  no  fault  can  be\nlegitimately  found    on  this\t score.\t Besides,  the\tonly\nquestion   of\t importance   now    is\t  as   regards\t the\ncreditworthiness of  the statement  which has been recorded.\nSince this statement has been found to be genuine and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">430</span>\ntrue nothing  can  detract  from  its  value.  The  evidence\nprovided by  the dying\tdeclaration is by itself good enough\nto support  the order  of conviction.  But this\t is not all.\nAlso available is the evidence of PW 37 Ujagar Singh and his\ndaughter-in-law, Munibai  (PW 38). The evidence of these two\nwitnesses lends\t full corroboration to the dying declaration\nof the\tvictim, and  has been  rightly relied  upon  by\t the\nSessions Court and the High Court. We have no reason to view\nthe evidence askance. The presence of these two witnesses in\nthe household  was natural.  Their evidence  shows  that  on\nhearing the  report of\tgun they  had  concealed  themselves\nbehind a  herd of cattle and had witnessed the incident from\nthere. We  have no  reason to  disagree with the view of the\nSessions Court\tand the\t High Court  that their\t evidence is\nreliable. There\t is no\tsubstance in  the argument  that the\nculprits could not have been identified as the light shed by\nthe lantern  was not  adequate to  enable identification. We\nhave already  spelled out  our reasons\tfor  repelling\tthis\ncontention. The\t finding of guilt is thus fully supported by\nevidence. We  accordingly confirm  the same  unhesitatingly.\nTwo of\tthe five  appellants (viz:  Machhi Singh  and  Jagir\nSingh) have  been sentenced  to death. We will deal with the\nquestion of sentence in so far as they are concerned after a\nshortwhile. In\tregard to  the remaining  three, viz: Phuman\nSingh, Jagtar  Singh and Kashmir Singh son of Wadhawa Singh,\nthe sentence  imposed by  the courts  below for\t the offence\nunder Sec.  302 read  with 149\tof <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_7\">IPC</a>;\t and other offences,\nmust be confirmed. Their appeals will stand dismissed.\nDeath Sentence\n     Having dealt with the appeals on merits from the stand-\npoint of  proof of  guilt and  validity or  otherwise of the\norder of  conviction, we  now come  face to  face  with\t the\nproblem indicated  when the  curtain was lifted, namely, the\napplication of the rarest-of-rare-cases rule to the facts of\nindividual cases  in the context of the relevant guidelines.\nSome reflections  on  the  question  of\t death\tpenalty\t may\nappropriately be  made before we tackle the said question in\nthe perspective of the present group of appeals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">     The reasons  why the  community as\t a  whole  does\t not\nendorse\t the   humanistic  approach   reflected\t in   &quot;death\nsentence-in-no-case&quot; doctrine  are not\tfar to\tseek. In the\nfirst place,  the very\thumanistic edifice is constructed on\nthe foundation\tof &quot;reverence  for life&quot;  principle. When  a\nmember of  the community  violates this\t very  principle  by\nkilling another member, the society may not feel itself\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">431</span>\nbound by  the shackles of this doctrine. Secondly, it has to\nbe realized  that every\t member of  the community is able to\nlive  with   safety  without  his  or  her  own\t life  being\nendangered because  of the  protective arm  of the community\nand on\taccount of  the rule of law enforced by it. The very\nexistence of  the rule\tof law and the fear of being brought\nto book\t operates as  a\t deterrent  to\tthose  who  have  no\nscruples in  killing others  if it  suits their\t ends. Every\nmember of  the community  owes a  debt to  the community for\nthis  protection.  When\t ingratitude  is  shown\t instead  of\ngratitude by  &#x27;Killing&#x27; a  member  of  the  community  which\nprotects the murderer himself from being killed, or when the\ncommunity feels\t that for  the sake of self preservation the\nkiller has to be killed, the community may well withdraw the\nprotection  by\t sanctioning  the  death  penalty.  But\t the\ncommunity will\tnot do\tso in  every case.  It may do so (in\nrarest of  rare cases)\twhen its collective conscience is so\nshocked that  it will  expect the  holders of  the  judicial\npower centre  to inflict death penalty irrespective of their\npersonal opinion  as regards  desirability or  otherwise  of\nretaining death\t penalty. The  community may  entrain such a\nsentiment when\tthe crime is viewed from the platform of the\nmotive for, or the manner of commission of the crime, or the\nanti-social or\tabhorrent nature  of the  crime, such as for\ninstance:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">I Manner of Commission of Murder\n     When the  murder is  committed in\tan extremely brutal,\ngrotesque, diabolical.\trevolting, or dastardly manner so as\nto arouse  intense and extreme indignation of the community.\nFor instance,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">     (i)  When the  house of  the victim  is set aflame with\n\t  the end in view to roast him alive in the house.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">     (ii) When the  victim is  subjected to  inhuman acts of\n\t  torture or  cruelty in order to bring about his or\n\t  her death.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">     (iii)When the  body of the victim is cut into pieces or\n\t  his body is dismembered in a fiendish manner.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">II Motive for Commission of murder\n     When the  murder is committed for a motive which evince\ntotal depravity\t and meanness. For instance when (a) a hired\nassassin commits  murder for the sake of money or reward (2)\na cold blooded\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">432</span>\nmurder is  committed with  a deliberate\t design in  order to\ninherit property  or to gain control over property of a ward\nor a  person under  the control of the murderer or vis-a-vis\nwhom the  murderer is  in a  dominating\t position  or  in  a\nposition of  trust.

For instance when\nsuch a crime is committed in order to terrorize such persons\nand frighten  them into\t fleeing from a place or in order to\ndeprive them  of, or  make them\t with a view to reverse past\ninjustices and in order to restore the social balance.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">     (b) In  cases of  &#x27;bride burning&#x27; and what are known as\n&#x27;dowry deaths&#x27;\tor when\t murder is  committed  in  order  to\nremarry for  the sake  of extracting  dowry once again or to\nmarry another woman on account of infatuation.\nIV Magnitude of Crime\n     When the  crime is enormous in proportion. For instance\nwhen multiple  murders say  of all or almost all the members\nof a  family or\t a large  number of  persons of a particular\ncaste, community, or locality, are committed.\nV Personality of Victim af murder\n     When the  victim of murder is (a) an innocent child who\ncould not have or has not provided even an excuse, much less\na provocation,\tfor murder. (b) a helpless woman or a person\nrendered helpless  by old  age or  infirmity  (c)  when\t the\nvictim is  a person  vis-a vis\twhom the  murderer is  in  a\nposition of  domination or  trust (d)  when the\t victim is a\npublic figure generally loved and respected by the community\nfor the services rendered by him and the murder is committed\nfor  political\t or  similar  reasons  other  than  personal\nreasons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1201493\" id=\"span_19\">In this  background the  guidelines indicated in <a href=\"/doc/1201493/\" id=\"a_8\">Bachan\nSingh</a>&#x27;s case  (supra) will have to be culled out and applied\nto the\tfacts of  each individual case where the question of\nimposing  of   death   sentences   arises.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1201493\" id=\"span_20\">The   following\npropositions emerge from <a href=\"/doc/1201493/\" id=\"a_9\">Bachan Singh</a>&#x27;s case:</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">433</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">     (i)  the extreme penalty of death need not be inflicted\n\t  except in gravest cases of extreme culpability;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">     (ii) Before  opting   for\t the   death   penalty\t the\n\t  circumstances of the &#x27;offender&#x27; also require to be\n\t  taken\t   into\t   consideration    alongwith\t the\n\t  circumstances of the &#x27;crime&#x27;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">     (iii)Life imprisonment  is the  rule and death sentence\n\t  is an\t exception.
