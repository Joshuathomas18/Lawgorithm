They were both tried by the Additional Sessions \nJudge, Sirsa in Sessions  Trial No.46 of 1991 charged \nvariously of offences under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 302</a>, <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_2\">307</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_3\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_4\">34</a>, \n<a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_5\">307</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_6\">34</a> IPC and under <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 25</a>/<a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_8\">27</a> of the Arms Act.  The \nlearned Additional Sessions Judge by his judgment and \norder dated March 6, 1992 acquitted A-2 of all the charges \nlevelled against him but found A-1 guilty of the offence \nunder Section 304 Part I holding that he had exceeded his \nright of private defence.  Accordingly, he sentenced A-1 to \nundergo rigorous imprisonment for a period of 10 years and \nto pay a fine of Rs.50,000/-, in default further to undergo \nrigorous imprisonment for a period of two years.  Both the \nappellants were acquitted of other charges levelled against \nthem.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">\tAggrieved by the judgment and order of the learned \nAdditional Sessions Judge, Criminal Appeal No. 375-DBA \nof 1992 was preferred by the State of Haryana before the \nHigh Court of Punjab and Haryana at Chandigarh against the \nacquittal of A-2 under Sections 302 and 307 read with \n<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 34</a> IPC.  Suba Singh preferred Criminal Appeal No. \n105-SB of 1992 against his conviction under Section 304 \nPart I <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">IPC</a>, while the informant Balbir Singh preferred a \nCriminal Revision No.68 of 1993 against the same \nimpugned judgment and order acquitting the appellants of \nthe other charges levelled against them.  The two Appeals \nand the Criminal Revision have been disposed of by a \ncommon judgment and order of the High Court dated March \n6, 1992.  The High Court allowed the appeal filed by the \nState and held A-2 guilty of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_11\">sections 302</a> \nand <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_12\">307</a> IPC.  A-1 was found guilty and convicted under \n<a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_14\">34</a> and <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_15\">307</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_16\">34</a> IPC.  A-1 was also found guilty \nof the offence under <a href=\"/doc/244673/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 27</a> of the Arms Act.  A-2 has \nbeen sentenced to undergo life imprisonment under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_18\">Section \n302</a> IPC and to pay a fine of Rs.10,000/- and in default to \nundergo further rigorous imprisonment for two years.  He \nhas also been sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment \nfor 10 years under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 307</a> IPC and to pay a fine of \nRs.5,000/- in default to undergo further rigorous \nimprisonment for one year.  A-1 has been sentenced to \nundergo life imprisonment under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_21\">34</a> IPC and to \npay a fine of Rs.10,000/- in default to undergo further \nrigorous imprisonment for ten years.  Under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 307</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_23\">34</a> \nIPC he has been sentenced to undergo rigorous \nimprisonment for ten years and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- in \ndefault to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for one \nyear.  While so allowing the appeal preferred by the State \nthe High Court has in a mechanical manner allowed the \nCriminal Revision preferred by the informant, which in \neffect had become infructuous since an appeal had been \npreferred by the State which was ultimately allowed.  In any \nevent a Criminal Revision preferred by a private party \nagainst an order of acquittal could not result in the \nconviction of the  accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\tThe Criminal Appeal preferred by A-1 against his \nconviction under Section 304 Part I was also disposed of in \nthe above terms.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">\tThe appellant  Shingara Singh has preferred Criminal \nAppeal Nos. 682-683 of 1996 while A-1 Suba Singh has \npreferred Special Leave Petition Nos. 2106-2108 of 1996.  \nIn the Special Leave Petition notice was issued with the \ndirection that the matter be heard along with Criminal \nAppeal Nos. 682-683 of 1996  preferred by A-2.  In fact, \nthere was no need for A-1 to file a Special Leave Petition \nsince in view of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1270615/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 380</a> of the Code of \nCriminal Procedure, an appealable judgment  and order \nhaving been passed against co-accused Shingara Singh, A-2, \nappellant Suba Singh, A-1 also had a right of appeal to this \nCourt.  However, we grant special leave to Suba Singh and \nproceed to dispose of these appeals by this common \njudgment and order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\tA-1, Suba Singh and Gurdeep Singh (father of the \ndeceased) lived in adjoining houses in Village Chak Sahban.  \nSuba Singh, A-1 and Gurdeep Singh are married to two \nsisters and are therefore related as co-brothers.   A-2, \nShingara Singh is the son of Suba Singh while the deceased \nSurinder Singh was the son-in-law of Gurdeep Singh.  It is \nnot in dispute that the courtyard of the two houses are \nadjacent divided by a common wall.  The courtyard of \nGurdeep Singh is at a slightly higher level than the courtyard \nof A-1, Suba Singh.  The case of the prosecution is that \nGurdeep Singh sold away his lands in village Chak Sahban \nand purchased lands in village Mallewala.  He also intended \nto sell his house in village Chak Sahban and with that in \nview he had entered into an agreement with A-1, Suba Singh \nto sell his house in the village for a sum of Rs.52,000/-.  \nAccording to the prosecution, A-1 Suba Singh failed to pay \nthe amount within the time stipulated and therefore a dispute \narose between him and Gurdeep Singh.  On July 1, 1991 the  \nmatter was settled by a Panchayat consisting of relatives of \nthe parties who are themselves interrelated.  In Panchayat it \nwas settled that A-1 Suba Singh will purchase the house and \nwill pay a sum of Rs.45,000/- by way of consideration.  It is \nnot in dispute that immediately after the decision of the \nPanchayat A-1, Suba Singh actually paid a sum of \nRs.45,000/- to Gurdeep Singh and honoured the decision of \nthe Panchayat.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">\tThe case of the prosecution is that later in the day at \nabout 6.30 p.m. Balbir Singh, PW-5  Raghbir Singh son of \nGurdeep Singh, Rur Singh, PW-6, Jagdip Singh and \nGurdeep Singh were taking meals in the courtyard of \nGurdeep Singh.  According to the evidence produced by the \nprosecution there were cots on which food was being served \nby Gian Kaur, PW-7, wife of Gurdeep Singh.  The case of \nthe prosecution is that Suredner Singh (deceased) son-in-law \nof Gurdeep Singh wanted to take away his cycle which  \nrested against the common wall of his courtyard.  While he \nwas doing so the appellants climbed up the common wall \nwith the help of a ladder.  While A-1 was empty handed, A-\n2 was carrying a licenced gun belonging to his father.  A-1 \nexhorted his son to kill Surinder Singh since he had been \nhelping his father-in-law in the dispute relating to the \npurchase of the house in the village.  A-2, thereafter fired at \nSurinder Singh  injuring him on his forehead as a result of \nwhich he fell down.  Gian Kaur, PW-7 rushed to the rescue \nof her son-in-law but A-2 shot at her also causing injury on \nthe dorsal aspect of her right hand.  On alarm being raised \nboth the appellants ran away.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">\tAfter leaving the dead body in the care of Jeet Singh \nwho had come there by then, Balbir Singh, PW-5 left for the \npolice station.  After covering a distance of two kilometers \nhe boarded a tractor and came to Sirsa where he met \nSukhdev Singh to whom he narrated the incident.  They, \nthereafter, went to the police station Sadar and PW-5 lodged \na report at 10 p.m.\n\n\tSub Inspector, Pohp Singh, PW-10, the Investigating \nOfficer came to the place of occurrence and held inquest \nover the body of Surinder Singh.  He, thereafter arranged to \nget the body sent for post mortem examination.  He also \nlifted blood stained earth from the place of occurrence.  \nThereafter, he went to the hospital and in the early morning \nof July 2, 1991  recorded the statement of Gian Kaur, PW-7 \nand Rur Singh, PW-6.  He again came back to the place of \noccurrence and prepared a rough site plan Ex. RR.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">\tDr. Beena Garg, PW-1 conducted the post mortem \nexamination on the body of Surinder Singh at the General \nHospital, Sirsa on July 2, 1991 at 10 a.m..  She found the \nfollowing ante-mortem injuries on the person of deceased, \nSurinder Singh.\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">\t&quot;1.\tA lacerated wound with inverted margins of \n2.5 cm. x 2 cm. on the middle of fore-head 4 cm. above \nthe base of nose on mid line.  Abrasion of 2 cm area in \nsize was present surrounding this wound.  Underlying \nbones were fractured.  Brain matter was seen to the \nwhole on dissection.  Underlying bone fractured.  \nDirection of the wound was upward and posteriorly.  \nThere was opening of 1.5 cm. x 1 cm. on the top of \noccipital bone in the midline.  There was fracture of \nfrontal both pariet alright temporal and occipital bone.  \nSmall pieces of bone were present in fractured area of \noccipital bone. Two flatent metallic pieces were \nrecovered from this area.  These pieces were sealed and \nhanded over to the police.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">2.\t2.5 cm x 1 cm lacerated wound with coverted \nmargins present over the left frontal area, 5 cm above the \nlateral margins of left eye brow.  Underlying bones were \nfractured.  On dissection there was communication of \ninjuries No.2 and 3.  Direction of the track was slightly \nupward-backward and medially.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">3.\tLacerated wound 2.5 cm x 1.5 cm with everted \nmargins over the left temporal region of scalp, 6 cm from \nthe pinna of left ear.  On dissection, the underlying bone \nwas found fractured.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">According to PW-1, the  death was due to injuries to \nthe brain caused by a fire arms.  The injuries were sufficient \nto cause death in the ordinary course of nature and the time \nthat elapsed between the death and the post mortem \nexamination was 12 to 24 hours.   Having regard to the \nnature of injuries she opined that firing must have been done \nfrom lower level to higher level.  Deceased must have been \nat a higher level than the person firing the gun.  There were \nno blackening scars around the wounds.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\tThe case of the prosecution is that the accused were \narrested on July 3, 1991.  Shingara Singh, A-2 produced \nbefore the Investigating Officer the licenced gun of his \nfather (A-1) which was taken into possession by the \nInvestigating Officer.  Suba Singh, A-1 is said to have \nproduced two empty and four live cartridges which were \nalso taken into possession.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">\tOn July 4, 1991 the site plan was drawn up by the \ndraftsman, PW-4 which was  marked Exh.P-E.  The said site \nplan shows that the height of the wall on the side of the \ncourtyard of Gurdeep  Singh was 4 feet 4 inches.  According \nto PW-4 he prepared the site plan as pointed out to him by \nBalbir Singh, PW-5 and Raghbir Singh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">\tAfter investigation, the appellants were put up for trial \nvariously charged as noticed earlier.  The defence of the \nappellant Suba Singh as stated by him in his examination \nunder <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 313</a> Cr.P.C. was that the occurrence did not \ntake place in the manner alleged by the prosecution.  He \nadmitted that a Panchayat was convened for resolving the \ndispute relating to the purchase of land by him.  He also \nadmitted that in view of the settlement arrived at he paid a \nsum of Rs.45,000/- to Gurdeep Singh.  However, he denied \nthat he climbed up the wall with the help of a ladder and \nexhorted his son Shingara Singh to kill Surinder Singh, who \nwas taking away his cycle which rested against the common \nwall.   He stated that it was Surinder Singh (deceased) who \nhad climbed the wall and was resorting to brick batting.  \nWith folded hands he requested him not to do so.  At that \ntime his son Shingara Singh, A-2 was not present.  Despite \nhis pleadings, Surinder Singh (deceased) removed the bricks \nfrom the wall and threw them at him which hit him.  Gian \nKaur, PW-7 was supplying brick bats to Surinder Singh \nfrom the wall.  Surinder Singh (deceased) shouted that he \nhad got the amount reduced by Rs.7,000/-.  When this was \nhappening he went inside his house, brought his gun and \nfired shots in his self defence which might have hit him.  He \nstated that he had himself produced the gun before the \nInvestigating Officer as also the two empties on the very \nfirst day i.e. July 1, 1991.  A false case has been made out \nagainst him and his son.  In fact, his son was in the fields at \nthe time of occurrence but he had been falsely implicated on \naccount of his being his only son.  Witness PW-6, Rur Singh \nhad old enmity with him and he had also appeared as a  \nwitness against him in a civil case prior to the occurrence.\n Same is the defence of Shingara Singh, A-2.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">\tAt the trial, the prosecution mainly relied upon the \ntestimony of three alleged eye witnesses viz. Balbir Singh \nPW-5, Rur Singh PW-6 and Gian Kaur, PW-7.  It also \nappears from the record that though some other witnesses \nwere cited by the prosecution they were given up as being \nunnecessary which included Gurdeep Singh, Raghbir Singh, \nJagbir Singh and some others.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">\tThe Trial Court on consideration of the evidence on \nrecord came to the conclusion that the prosecution case as \nalleged was not true and that the occurrence took place in all \nprobability in the manner alleged by the defence.  It noticed \nthat all the three aforesaid eye witnesses had stated earlier \nthat both the appellants had climbed the common wall and \nfrom there the firing took place resulting in injuries to \nSurinder Singh (deceased) and Gian Kaur, PW-7.  This \nversion was given by PW-5 in his FIR and the same version \nwas repeated by PWs 6 and 7 in their statements recorded \nunder Section 161 Cr. P.C..  However, at the trial all the \nthree witnesses consistently gave a different version so as to \nbring the prosecution case in accord with the findings of the \nMedical Officer who had opined, having regard to the nature \nof injuries, that the injured must have been at a higher level \nthan the person using the fire arm.  If really, the appellants \nhad climbed the wall and A-2 fired at Surinder Singh, \ntrajectory of the pellets would have shown a downward \nmovement and not an upward movement as found by the \nMedical Officer.  At the Trial all the three witnesses \nchanged their version by stating that only A-1, Suba Singh \nclimbed on the wall with the help of a ladder, while  his son \nShingara Singh, A-2 was still on the ladder and had not \nclimbed the wall.  He was standing on the ladder in a \nmanner that only his face was visible from the courtyard of \nGurdeep Singh.  He placed the barrel of the gun on the wall \nand without resting the butt of the gun against his shoulder, \nfired at Surinder Singh.  In this manner, it was sought to be \nprojected that Surinder Singh was at a higher level than the \nlevel of the weapon of Shingara Singh, A-2 when he  fired \nthe gun.  The Trial Court concluded that the tailored  version \ngiven by the witnesses for the first time in the witness box \nwas only with a view to bring the prosecution case in accord \nwith the medical evidence on record and to negative the case \nof the defence that it was Surinder Singh, who was standing \non the wall while the firing took place from the ground \nlevel.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">\tThe Trial Court also found that Suba Singh, A-1 had \nsix injuries on his person.  On being arrested he was sent for \nmedical examination by the Investigating Officer and was \nexamined by Dr. Chaudhary, DW-1 who found the \nfollowing injuries on his person:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">&quot;1.\t\tA bruise 4 x 2 cm on dorso \nlateral aspect of metacarpal of index \nfinger, with abrasion 1 cm x linear in the \nspace between right index finger and \nthumb on dorsal aspect.  Soft scalp of \nlight brown colour was present and \ncolour of bruise was brownish.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">Tenderness was present and x-ray was \nadvised.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">2.\tA lacerated wound 2 cm x 2 cm \nx skin and tissue deep on the back of the \nleft leg, on lateral side, 7 cm above the \nsole of the left foot.  Serious fluid exuded \nfrom the wound.  The granolation tissue \nwas visible at places and edges of the \nwound were irregular and inflamed, with \nswelling of adjacent parts.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">3.\tSwelling 2 x 1 cm on the top of \nscalp, left to the midline and 12 cm from \nthe base of nose.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">4.\tBruise 4 x 2 cm on left scapular \nregion above its upper border, placed \nhorizently of brownish colour.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">5.\tComplaint of pain on the right \nside of chest and infera axillary region, \nwith tenderness.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">6.\tAbrasion = cm x linear on the \nback of the right elbow.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\tIt will be noticed from the above injuries that one of \nthe injuries was on the scalp and caused by a blunt \nsubstance.  The possibility of these injuries being caused by  \nbrick-bats could not be ruled out.  In cross- examination Dr. \nChaudhary admitted that the possibility of all the injuries \nexcept No.3 having  been caused by friendly hands could not \nbe ruled out.  The Trial  Court, therefore, concluded that the \npresence of injuries on Suba Singh, A-1 which had not been \nexplained by the prosecution  supported the defence version \nand rendered it probable.  Though the injuries were found to \nbe simple in nature and could have been self inflicted as \nwell, it was difficult to believe that so many injuries could \nbe self suffered by the accused.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">\tThe Trial Court found that the other evidence on \nrecord also supported the defence version and rendered it \nprobable.  The Investigating Officer, PW-10 admitted in his \ncross-examination that when he visited the place of \noccurrence he had found that some of the bricks had been \nremoved from the common wall.  It was the case of the \ndefence that Surinder Singh (deceased) had thrown bricks at \nSuba Singh, A-1 from top of the wall.  Though it was the \ncase of the prosecution that A-1 climbed the wall and A-2 \nstood on the ladder and fired at the deceased, in the site plan \nExh. P-R which was prepared by the Investigating Officer \non July 2, 1991, the ladder has not been shown at all.  A \nsecond site plan was drawn to scale on July 4, 1991 by PW-\n4 which is Exh. P-E.  In that plan the point where the cycle \nof the deceased had been kept has not been shown.  PW-10 \nexplained by saying that in the site plan drawn by him Exh. \nP-R the cycle was shown at &#x27;J&#x27;.  He, however, admitted that \nthe cycle was not taken into possession.  The Trial Court \nfound that point J the last point shown in the marginal notes,  \nseems to have been interpolated later.  These facts, therefore \ndo not  support the case of the prosecution that Surinder \nSingh had gone to take his bicycle when he was fired upon \nby A-2 who had climbed on top of the wall with the help of \na ladder.  The medical evidence was only consistent with the \nhypothesis, that having regard to the direction of the injury \non the head of Surinder Singh,  he must have been at a \nhigher level when fired upon by someone who was at a \nlower level. This was consistent with the case of the defence \nthat firing was resorted to from the ground level when \nSurinder Singh (deceased) was throwing brick bats after \nclimbing the common wall.  The Trial Court also found that \nRur Singh did not appear to be a reliable witness because he \ndenied the fact that  A-1 had deposed against him in a Civil \nSuit.  This statement was proved to be false and the \ndeposition of A-1 was produced before the Court which \nproved the fact that A-1 had deposed against him in a Civil \nsuit and this  also established  that Rur Singh was not on \ngood terms with A-1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">\tHaving regard all aspects of the matter the Trial Court \nconcluded that the defence version appeared to be more \nprobable.  It was also consistent with the medical evidence \non record.  The prosecution witnesses had made vital \nimprovements in their deposition with a view to make their \nevidence consistent with the medical evidence on record.  \nThe prosecution  failed to explain the injuries suffered by A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">1.  The fact that some bricks had been removed from top of \nthe common wall supported the defence case that Surinder \nSingh (deceased) had thrown bricks at A-1.  The existence \nof ladder and cycle was rendered doubtful because they were \nnot even shown  in the site plans prepared by the \nprosecution.  Moreover, the appellants not only produced the \ngun but also the empties which were found to have been \nfired from the same gun.  The Trial Court also considered \nthe question as to whether there was any motive on the part \nof the appellants to commit the offence.  It found that the \nappellants could have no motive to commit the offence \nbecause the dispute if any was amicably settled by the \nPanchayat and respecting the decision of the Panchayat A-1 \nhad promptly paid Rs.45,000/- to Gurdeep Singh.  Having \ndone so, there was no reason for them to commit the \noffence.  On the other hand, so far as Gurdeep Singh and his \nfamily members are concerned, they may have reconciled to \nthe fact that they had to receive Rs.7,000/- less than the \namount agreed to be paid, but Surinder Singh being a young \nperson was angry and aggrieved on account of the fact that \nthe Panchayat had reduced the price of the house to be sold \nby his father-in-law.  The motive if any could be entertained \nonly by Surinder Singh and not by the appellants.  However, \nas observed by the Trial Court motive was not of  much \nsignificance in a case where the prosecution sought to prove \nits case by  direct evidence of eye witnesses.  The Trial \nCourt, therefore, concluded that the occurrence took place in \nthe manner stated by the defence.  In all probability Shingara \nSingh, A-2 was not  present when the occurrence took place.  \nHowever, it held that though A-1, Suba Singh had a right of \nprivate defence, he certainly exceeded that  right in as much \nas the facts and circumstances did not justify his using the \nweapon in such a manner as to cause the death of Surinder \nSingh (deceased).  He, therefore, found him guilty of the \noffence punishable under Section 304 Part I of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_26\">IPC</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">\tIn the appeals the High Court has reversed the \nfindings recorded by the Trial Court.  The High Court held \nthat the Trial Court was not justified in holding that the \ndefence version was more probable since all the three \nwitnesses had improved upon their statements under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_27\">Section \n161</a> Cr.P.C. and made significant  changes while deposing \nbefore the Trial Court.  The High Court considered the \ndeposition of these three witnesses namely PWs 5, 6 and 7 \nand came to the conclusion that they had not stated that the \nfiring was resorted to from the ground level.  Their \ndeposition in Court  proved that Shingara Singh, A-2 while \non the ladder fired at Surinder Singh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">\tIn our view, the High Court has completely missed \nthe significance of the finding recorded by the Trial Court.  \nThe Trial Court found that in the FIR as also  statements \nrecorded under Section 161 Cr. P.C. the witnesses had \nclearly mentioned that both the appellants had climbed on \ntop of the wall and from there Shingara Singh, A-2 fired at \nSurinder Singh.  If this version were to be accepted, the \ninjury caused would not have been of the nature found by \nthe Medical Officer who was clearly of the opinion, having \nregard to the trajectory of injuries,  that the person firing the \nfire arm was at a lower level than the victim.  Therefore, \nwith a view to bring their case in consonance with the \nmedical evidence on record, all the three witnesses made \nsignificant changes while deposing in Court and all of them \nthereafter consistently stated that while A-1 had climbed on \ntop of the wall A-2 stood on the ladder in such a manner that \nonly his face was visible from across the wall and while \nstanding in that position, keeping the barrel of the gun on the \nwall and without resting the butt of the gun against his \nshoulder, he fired at the deceased.   There was no dispute \nthat their deposition in Court was consistent, but what was \nobserved by the trial court was that their version as to the \nmanner of occurrence as deposed to by them was at variance \nwith what was stated in the first information report by PW 5, \nand in the statements of PWs 6 and 7 recorded under Section \n161 Cr. P.C.   When confronted with their earlier statements, \nthey could not give a satisfactory explanation, with the result \nthat their credibility was sufficiently impeached.  The \nchange of version by each one of them, and to the same \neffect, was deliberate and not merely accidental or an \naccount of lapse of memory.  It cannot be disputed that this \nwas a very   significant  change.  It cannot   also   be \ndisputed that the change was deliberately made by all the \nwitnesses, so that the prosecution case became consistent  \nwith the medical evidence on record.  We, therefore, do not \nfind any error committed by the Trial Court in coming to \nthis conclusion.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">The High Court then held that the upward  direction \nof the wound could be on account of deflection of the \nmetallic pieces of the bullet after striking the occipital  bone.  \nIn the first instance there is no basis for this speculation.  No \nsuch question was put to the doctor PW-1, Beena Garg, nor \nis there any other evidence to support this finding.  \nMoreover, this was not a case of bullet being fired at the \ndeceased.  The doctor found pellet injuries caused to the  \ndeceased.  The pellets having penetrated the skull bone, \nthere was no possibility of its deflection because the brain \nmatter is soft and cannot cause deflection of pellets or bullet.  \nBe that as it may, it cannot be readily inferred, having regard \nto the evidence of the prosecution itself, that the direction of \nthe injury was otherwise and not as found by PW-1.  The \nfinding that the pellet must have got deflected is at best \nspeculative.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">\tThe High Court then found that the failure of the \nprosecution to explain the injuries on Suba Singh, A-1 did \nnot affect the case of the prosecution.  The reason assigned \nby the High Court is that he was not medically examined on \nthe same day but was got examined by the police  two days \nlater, on July 3, 1991.  This reason does not impress us \nbecause the medical evidence on record is consistent with \nthe injuries having been caused at about the time of \noccurrence.  The High Court then observed that according to \nthe doctor the injuries except one could be self suffered. It \ntherefore jumped to the conclusion that all the injuries may \nhave been self suffered.  It is possible for one to conjecture \nthat the injuries  may have been self suffered, but that does \nnot provide a good reason for setting aside a finding of fact \nrecorded by the Trial Court which came to the conclusion \nthat A-1, Suba Singh resorted to firing when Surinder Singh \n(deceased) threw brick bats at him.  The evidence of the \nInvestigating Officer, PW-10 also disclosed that some bricks \nhad been removed form top of the wall where the firing took \nplace.  Unfortunately, the Investigating Officer does not \nappear to have bothered to inspect the courtyard of the \naccused and therefore it is not possible to conjecture as to \nwhether some brick bats were lying in the court yard of the \naccused, which may have further supported the defence \ncase.  The High court has observed that no such brick bats \nwere found on the spot, but in doing so the High Court has \nnot correctly appreciated the evidence of the Investigating \nOfficer who does not appear to have at all inspected the \ncourtyard of the accused.  The High Court, further, observed \nthat removal of the bricks from the wall would have been \nshown by the Investigating Officer in the site plan and also \nby the drafts-man who prepared another site plan, but these \ntwo witnesses have not shown the removal of the bricks \nfrom the wall  in the site plans prepared by them.  No doubt \nit is so, but what the High Court has failed to notice is the \nfactual statement made by PW-10, the Investigating Officer \nwho after consulting the case diary stated before the Court \nthat he had  noted the fact that some of the bricks had been \nremoved from the common wall.         \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">\tIf such be the factual position, the failure to show that \nin the site plans cannot prejudice the case of the defence.  \nThe High Court then found  that the appellants had a motive \nto commit the offence and it held so for the reason that A-1, \nSuba Singh had to make payment and part with  money to \nbuy the house after he had backed out of the agreement.  In \nour view, having regard to the fact that the price of the house \nhad been reduced by the Panchayat, Suba Singh, A-1 could \nhardly entertain a grudge on this account.  Moreover, he \nreadily paid Rs.45,000/- to Gurdeep Singh immediately after \nthe settlement,  before the occurrence took place on that day, \nwhich only shows that he was more than happy to buy the \nhouse at a reduced price.  Therefore, in our view, he had no \nmotive to commit the offence and we entirely agree with the \nfinding of the trial court in this regard.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">By its impugned judgment the High court reversed the \norder of acquittal in so far as Shingara Singh, A-2 is \nconcerned and convicted him of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_28\">section \n302</a> IPC.  It further convicted accused No.1 Suba Singh of \nthe offence under section 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_29\">section 34</a> IPC \ninstead of section 304, Part I for which he was convicted by \nthe trial court.  We are of the view that the High Court was \nnot justified in setting aside the order of acquittal of A-2 \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_30\">section 302</a> IPC  having regard to the facts of the case.  \nIt is well settled that in an appeal against acquittal the High \nCourt is entitled to re-appreciate the entire evidence on \nrecord but having done so if it finds that the view taken by \nthe trial court is a possible reasonable view of the evidence \non record, it will not substitute its opinion for that of the trial \ncourt.  Only in cases where the High Court finds that the \nfindings recorded by the trial court are  unreasonable or \nperverse or that the court has committed a serious error of \nlaw, or where the trial court had recorded its findings in \nignorance of relevant material on record or by taking into \nconsideration evidence which is not admissible, the High \nCourt may be  justified in reversing the order of acquittal.  \nWe do not find this case to be one where the High Court was \njustified in reversing the findings recorded by the trial court.  \nAt best, it may be contended that the view taken by the High \nCourt is also a reasonable view of the evidence on record.  \nHowever, we cannot say that the view taken by the trial \ncourt was not another reasonable view of the evidence on \nrecord.  It is well settled that where two views are \nreasonably possible on the basis of the evidence on record, \nthe one that favours the accused must be accepted.  In any \nevent in a case of  acquittal if the view of the trial court is a  \npossible reasonable view of the evidence on record, \ninterference by the High Court may not be justified. \n Apart from the reasons given by the trial court we \nfind that there are many other features which create a serious \ndoubt about the truthfulness of the prosecution case.  The \ncase of the prosecution was that the prosecution witnesses \nand others were having their meals at about 6.30 p.m. sitting \non cots in the court-yard of Gurdeep Singh.  PW-5, Balbir \nSingh has stated that there were three such cots lying in the \ncourtyard of Gurdeep Singh when PW-10 the Investigating \nOfficer came there.  But he further admits that the existence \nof these cots is not sown in the site plan prepared by him nor \nwas it shown in the site plan prepared by PW-4.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">\tThe second aspect of the prosecution case is that the \ncycle of Surinder Singh was resting against the common \nwall and when he went to bring the cycle he was shot at by \nShingara Singh A-2.  However, PW-10, the Investigating \nOfficer has admitted in his deposition that the cycle was not \nshown in the site plan prepared by him.  He then stated that \nit was shown in the site plan Ex. PR at J shown in the note.  \nThe trial court looked at the site plan and came to the \nconclusion that the note in the site plan showing the \npresence of the bi-cycle was an interpolation.  We also had a \nlook at the site plan Ex. PR and we are not in a position to \nsay that the trial court was not justified in making that \nobservation.     \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">\tSo far as the ladder is concerned, PW-5, Balbir Singh \nstated that the ladder was in the same position when the \nInvestigating Officer came to the place of occurrence but he \ncould not explain why it was not shown in the site plan \nprepared by the police.  Even PW-10 the Investigating \nofficer had to admit that in the site plan the position of the \nladder was not shown.  These features of the prosecution \ncase also support the conclusion reached by the trial court \nthat the occurrence must have taken place in a manner \ndifferent than the one deposed to by the alleged eye \nwitnesses.  The evidence on record with regard to the \nexistence of cots in the court-yard of Gurdeep Singh, the \nexistence of a bicycle, as also about the existence of a ladder \nis rather unsatisfactory and creates a serious doubt as to \nwhether the prosecution witnesses are telling the truth.  The \nomission to show them in both the site plans cannot be \nattributed to a mere lapse on the part of the investigating \nagency.  In fact so far as the site plans are concerned, the \ncase of the prosecution is that they were prepared in the \npresence of PW 5 and another witness and on their pointing.  \nHowever, PW 5 denied that the plans were prepared in his \npresence.  The other witness was not examined.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">   \tWe are, therefore, of the considered view that the \nHigh Court was not justified in setting aside the order of \nacquittal passed in favour Shingara Singh, A-2.  On \nappreciation of the evidence on record it appears to us that \nthe occurrence in all probability may have taken  place  in \nthe manner alleged by the defence, and not in the manner \nalleged by the prosecution.  If that be so we must hold that \nShingara Singh, A-2 was not even present when the \noccurrence took place.  He, therefore, is entitled to acquittal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">\tHowever, so far as the case of Suba Singh, A-1 is \nconcerned, we agree with the findings of the trial court that \nhe had exceeded the right of private defence.  In the facts \nand circumstances of the case there was no justification for \nusing his gun in such a manner as to cause the death of the \ndeceased.  We, therefore, find him guilty of the offence \nunder section 304 Part I <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_31\">IPC</a> but in the facts and \ncircumstances of the case sentence him to rigorous \nimprisonment  for  five years and to pay a fine of \nRs.10,000/-, in default of payment of fine he shall undergo \nimprisonment for further period of one year.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">\tAccordingly the appeals preferred by Shingara Singh, \nA-2 are allowed.  The appeals preferred by Suba Singh, A-1, \nare partly allowed and he is found guilty of the offence \npunishable under section 304 Part I <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_32\">IPC</a> instead of <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_33\">section \n302</a> IPC and sentenced as indicated above.\n</p>\n\n\t\t\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">L.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T.......T....R.\nAppeal (civil)#Appeal (civil)  4051 of 1996#1996#M/s Pepsi Foods Limited#Collector of Central Excise, Chandigarh#2003-11-25#25622#4051#P.
