He further deposed that when he \n\n\n\nwent to help Suresh to get up, Sunil Yadav (A-4) using his saif \n\n\n\nhit   him   on   his   upper   lip.     Bale   Yadav   (A-8)   gave   a  Gandassa \n\n\n\nblow   on   the   neck   of   Ganauri   Yadav   and   while   stopping   the \n\n\n\nblow   with   his   right   hand,   he   sustained   injury   on   his   palm. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">Kuldeep   Yadav   also   gave   him   a   Gandassa   blow   on   the   right \n\n\n\nhand.

According to him, Suresh was \n\n\n\nalive at the spot but he died on the way to Govindpur Hospital. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_57\">Even, in respect of use of weapons by the accused, he was not \n\n\n\nconsistent with his earlier statement made under Section 164 \n\n\n\nof   the   Code.     He   also   admitted   that   S.I.   seized   blood   stained \n\n\n\nearth   in   his   presence.     He   also   stated   that   even   though   S.I. \n\n\n\nsaw the clothes having blood spots but he did not seize them. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_58\">He   also   asserted   that   at   the   relevant   time,   he   was   repairing \n\n\n\ndiesel engine   and  Mohan-Mechanic   was  present  at  that  time. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">In   cross-examination,   he   also   admitted   that   there   is   another \n\n\n\ncounter case against the very same incident and he informed \n\n\n\nthe   court   that   on   that   day   he   did   not   see   any   injury   on   the \n\n\n\nperson   of   Brahmdeo   (A-1),   Sunil   Yadav   (A-9)   and   Musafir \n\n\n\nYadav.

It \n\n\n\nis   not   the   case   of   any   one   that   Suresh   was   running   towards \n\n\n\nthe accused.   On the other hand, it is their definite case that \n\n\n\nthe accused persons were chasing and Suresh and others were \n\n\n\nrunning to escape from them.  In such circumstances, there is \n\n\n\nno plausible explanation how the bullet hit Suresh Yadav - the \n\n\n\ndeceased, on his abdomen.  From his evidence, it is clear that \n\n\n\nthough   diesel   mechanic-Mohan   was   present,   he   denied   his \n\n\n\nrelationship with him in the statements made later on.  It was \n\n\n\nput to him that incident did not actually take place as stated \n\n\n\nand   all   accused   were   not   present.     It   is   also   clear   from   his \n\n\n\nevidence that injury on the accused was not seen by him.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">18)     The   next   witness   heavily   relied  on  by   the   prosecution   is \n\n\n\nMunshi   Yadav   (PW-7).     According   to   him,   accused   persons \n\n\n\nwere   armed   and   Brahmdeo   Yadav   (A1)   fired   a   shot   from   gun \n\n\n\nwhich   hit   Suresh   Yadav   on   his   abdomen   and   he   fell   on   the \n\n\n\nground  and  when   Ganauri  Yadav   (PW-3)   went   for   his  rescue, \n\n\n\nfive accused persons, namely, Bale Yadav (A8), Kuldeep Yadav \n\n\n\n(A6),   Sunil   Yadav   (A4),   Suraj   Yadav   (A11)   and   Shiv   Nandan \n\n\n\nYadav   (A10),   all   armed   with   deadly   weapons,   started   beating \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                                                17</span>\n\n\f\nhim.  Suresh Yadav died on the way to hospital.  His evidence \n\n\n\nalso   makes   it   clear   that   he   did   not   deny   the   presence   of \n\n\n\nmechanic-Mohan   at   the   place   of   occurrence.     According   to \n\n\n\nhim,   the   incident   started   when   diesel   engine   was   about   to \n\n\n\nstart.  A specific suggestion was put to him that Suresh Yadav \n\n\n\ndied from the bullet fired by Upendra Yadav.   It is relevant to \n\n\n\nnote the conduct of (PW-7).   He admitted in his evidence that \n\n\n\nafter   the   incident,   he   went   to   take   the   cow   for   grazing.     It   is \n\n\n\nunnatural   that   after   having   seen   the   incident,   without \n\n\n\nassociating with his fellow villagers about the crime, he coolly \n\n\n\nwent for grazing his cow which is unbelievable.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_61\">19)   Another   witness   relied   on   by   the   prosecution   is \n\n\n\nBindeshwar Prasad @ Manager Yadav (PW-4).  In his evidence, \n\n\n\nhe mentioned 17 persons as accused who were present at the \n\n\n\nplace of occurrence and, according to him, on seeing them, he \n\n\n\ngot   afraid   of   his   life   but   did   not   run   away   and   remained \n\n\n\nstanding.     He   said,   when   bullet   hit   Suresh,   they   started \n\n\n\nrunning.     He   further   deposed   that   except   Suresh   Yadav,   no \n\n\n\nother   fell   down   due   to   beating,   all   continued   running   and \n\n\n\nsome of them reached their homes and some remained there. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                                                     18</span>\n\n\f\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_62\">He   has   not   only   added   more   names   as   accused   persons   but \n\n\n\nalso asserted that the bomb was exploded after firing of shots. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">He   also   mentioned   that   Suresh   Yadav   died   on   the   way   to \n\n\n\nhospital.   A specific suggestion was also given to this witness \n\n\n\nthat   Suresh   Yadav   died   from   the   bullet   fired   by   Upendra \n\n\n\nYadav.   Here again, by drawing our attention to his statement \n\n\n\nunder  Section  164   of  the   Code,  it  was  pointed  out  that there \n\n\n\nwere   lot   of   contradictions   and   inconsistencies   in   respect   of \n\n\n\nvital aspects.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_64\">20)   The next witness relied on by the prosecution is Ganauri \n\n\n\nYadav (PW-3).   Like Bindeshwar Yadav (PW-4), he also named \n\n\n\n17   persons   as   accused   who   came   at   the   place   of   occurrence \n\n\n\nand (A1) fired from gun hitting the abdomen of Suresh Yadav \n\n\n\nand other accused persons started beating.   He said when he \n\n\n\nfell down, he was not hit on neck with gandassa.  He asserted \n\n\n\nthat Suresh Yadav died on the spot.   He received one blow of \n\n\n\nspear and two blows of gandassa.   He explained that the said \n\n\n\nblow of spear was given by poking it into his body and not like \n\n\n\nhitting  with  a  lathi.    He  further   deposed  that  the  attack  with \n\n\n\nspear   caused   a   hole   in   the   vest   also.     As   stated   earlier,   he \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                                19</span>\n\n\f\nasserted   that   Suresh   Yadav   died   at   the   place   of   occurrence \n\n\n\nitself,   which   is   not   in   tune   with   the   statement   of   other \n\n\n\nprosecution   witnesses.     He   said   that   blood   did   not   fall   on \n\n\n\ndiesel engine, however, it fell at the spot.  He also informed the \n\n\n\nCourt   that   the   blood   oozed   out   from   the   wounds   of   all   the \n\n\n\ninjured and its stains were present up to Govindpur hospital. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">He admitted that he did not see any injury on the persons of \n\n\n\naccused.   He admitted that he was not in full sense when he \n\n\n\nmade the statement to S.I. under Section 164 of the Code.  He \n\n\n\nalso   referred   to   the   use   of   bomb   which   was   kept   in   a   bag, \n\n\n\nthough, he did not say the same before the court.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">21)     Another   witness   relied   on   by   the   prosecution   is   Kesho \n\n\n\nYadav (PW-6)-father of the deceased.  He admitted that he had \n\n\n\ndiesel   engine   in   the   field   towards   north   of   village.     His   sons, \n\n\n\nnamely,   Suresh   Yadav   and   Naresh   Yadav   were   repairing   the \n\n\n\nsaid   engine   for   irrigation   purposes.     At   that   time,   all   the \n\n\n\naccused   Brahmdeo   Yadav   (A1),   Darogi  Mahto  (A2),   Maho \n\n\n\nYadav (A3), Sunil Yadav (A4) armed with guns in their hands, \n\n\n\naccused Kuldip Yadav, Shiv Nandan Yadav, Baleshwar, Suraj \n\n\n\nwith   gandassas,   Sunil   Yadav   with   saif,   Sudhir   yadav   with \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                                                 20</span>\n\n\f\nspear   and   Paro   Mahto   with   lathi   came   there.       He   further \n\n\n\nexplained   that   immediately   on   coming   there,   the   accused \n\n\n\npersons   surrounded   them   and   when   they   started   running, \n\n\n\nthey were caught in the field of Aziz Mian.  Accused Brahmdeo \n\n\n\nYadav   (A1)   fired   from   gun   and   the   bullet   hit   the   abdomen   of \n\n\n\nSuresh   Yadav   and   he   fell   down.     Naresh   Yadav   went   to   lift \n\n\n\nSuresh   from   the   ground   when   Sunil   Yadav   hit   him   with   saif \n\n\n\ncausing injury to his lips.   When Ganauri Yadav went to pick \n\n\n\nhim   up,   Kuldeep  Yadav   hit   on  his   neck   using   gandassa.     He \n\n\n\nalso asserted that his son Suresh Yadav died at the spot itself. \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_67\">He   further   informed   the   court  that  the   bullet   made   a  hole   in \n\n\n\nthe   vest   of  his   son  and  the   cloth   got  cut  edges  and   that  was \n\n\n\nhanded over to the police.  \n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">22)   Another witness examined on the side of the prosecution \n\n\n\nis   Dr.   Basudeo   Yadav   (PW-5).

This   section \n\n      creates   a   specific   offence   and   makes   every   member   of   the \n\n      unlawful   assembly   liable   for   the   offence   or   offences \n\n      committed in the course of the occurrence provided the same \n\n      was/were committed in prosecution of the common object or \n\n      was/were such as the members of that assembly knew to be \n\n      likely   to   be   committed.   Since   this   section   imposes   a \n\n      constructive penal liability, it must be strictly construed as it \n\n      seeks   to   punish   members   of   an   unlawful   assembly   for   the \n\n      offence   or   offences   committed   by   their   associate   or \n\n      associates   in   carrying   out   the   common   object   of   the \n\n      assembly. What is important in each case is to find out if the \n\n      offence was committed  to accomplish the  common object of \n\n      the   assembly   or   was   one   which   the   members   knew   to   be \n\n      likely to be committed. There must be a nexus between the \n\n      common object and the offence committed and if it is found \n\n      that   the   same   was   committed   to   accomplish   the   common \n\n      object   every   member   of   the   assembly   will   become   liable   for \n\n      the same.

The \n\n      two   clauses   of   Section   149   vary   in   degree   of   certainty.   The \n\n      first   clause   contemplates   the   commission   of   an   offence   by \n\n      any member  of an unlawful  assembly  which can be held to \n\n      have been committed in prosecution of the common object of \n\n      the assembly. The second clause embraces within its fold the \n\n      commission   of   an   act   which   may   not   necessarily   be   the \n\n      common  object  of the assembly,   nevertheless,   the  members \n\n      of   the   assembly   had   knowledge   of   likelihood   of   the \n\n      commission   of   that   offence   in   prosecution   of   the   common \n\n      object.   The   common   object   may   be   commission   of   one \n\n      offence   while   there   may   be   likelihood   of   the   commission   of \n\n      yet   another   offence,   the   knowledge   whereof   is   capable   of \n\n      being   safely   attributable   to   the   members   of   the   unlawful \n\n      assembly.   In   either   case,   every   member   of   the   assembly \n\n      would be vicariously liable for the offence actually committed \n\n      by any other member of the assembly. A mere possibility of \n\n      the commission   of the  offence would   not  necessarily  enable \n\n      the   court   to   draw   an   inference   that   the   likelihood   of \n\n      commission   of   such   offence   was   within   the   knowledge   of \n\n      every member of the unlawful assembly. It is difficult indeed, \n\n      though   not   impossible,   to   collect   direct   evidence   of   such \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                                                                          27</span>\n\n\f\n      knowledge.  An inference  may be  drawn  from circumstances \n\n      such   as   the   background   of   the   incident,   the   motive,   the \n\n      nature of the assembly, the nature of the arms carried by the \n\n      members   of   the   assembly,   their   common   object   and   the \n\n      behaviour of the members soon before, at or after the actual \n\n      commission of the crime. Unless the applicability of Section \n\n      149   --   either   clause   --   is   attracted   and   the   court   is \n\n      convinced,   on   facts   and   in   law,   both,   of   liability   capable   of \n\n      being   fastened   vicariously   by   reference   to   either   clause   of \n\n      <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_55\">Section   149</a>   IPC,   merely   because   a   criminal   act   was \n\n      committed by a member of the assembly every other member \n\n      thereof would not necessarily become liable for such criminal \n\n      act.  The inference  as  to  likelihood  of the  commission  of  the \n\n      given criminal act must be capable of being held to be within \n\n      the   knowledge   of   another   member   of   the   assembly   who   is \n\n      sought   to   be   held   vicariously   liable   for   the   said   criminal \n\n      act....&quot; \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"204022\" id=\"span_36\">The  same principles  have been  reiterated  in  <a href=\"/doc/204022/\" id=\"a_56\">State of Punjab \n\n\n\nvs. Sanjiv Kumar</a> alias Sanju and others (2007) 9 SCC 791.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">Summarization of the principles attracting S.149\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">31)     In   the   earlier   part   of   our   order,   we   have   analysed   the \n\n\n\nevidence led in by the prosecution and also pointed out several \n\n\n\ninfirmities   therein.
