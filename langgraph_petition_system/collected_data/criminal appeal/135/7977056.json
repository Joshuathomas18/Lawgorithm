The prosecution story in short is that on 23.6.2006 at\naround 7 pm the complainant Moharman Lal lodged the missing\nreport of his grand son Shubham @ Shailu S/o Neeraj Sharma,\naged around 10 years and has stated that his grand son Shubham\n@ Shailu went to the Variety Public School, Pati Gali, Morena for\ntuition. When Shubham not returned back at around 1.00 pm then\nhe was searched to all the relevant places. His teacher told him\nthat Shubham @ Shailu conveyed him that he was going to learn\nskating. That missing report was lodged and search was started.\nTill 1.7.2006 the missing child was not traced, hence, FIR under\n<a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 365</a> of IPC was lodged in Crime No.450/2006. On\n7.7.2006 information was given telephonically to the police that\nfrom the house of Shankar Singh Gurjar which was locked from\nthe outside, foul smell was coming out. Hence, police reached the\nspot and opened the house. There the body of the deceased boy\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                             -(4)          CRA No. 625/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                          CRA No. 713/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                          CRA No.1046/2014</span>\n\n\n\n\nwas found in a plastic bag and it was kept over the shelf of\nlavatory and wall was constructed to hide the body of the\ndeceased.

The\nstatements of prosecution witnesses were recorded wherein the\nprosecution witnesses Ramkrishan, Bajrangi, Bafatan, Ameena,\nSonu Sharma, Ranjeeta had given evidence with regard to last\nseen theory and had stated that they had seen 15-16 days back the\ndeceased Shubham along with two boys residents of first floor of\nthe building. The dead body was identified by the prosecution\nwitnesses. The accused Raghuveer and Shailendra Sharma were\narrested. After completion of investigation, charge sheet was filed\nagainst the appellants/accused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">4.

The grounds raised in this appeal are that in the\nmissing report there was no mention of commission of offence by\nthe appellants, despite of it, convicting the appellants are\nerroneous. There is no direct or indirect involvement of the\nappellants. The evidence of Moharman Lal (PW/1), Bafatan\n(PW/2), Ameena (PW/3), Sonu (PW/4), Bajarangi (PW/5),\nRamdeen (PW/6) and Niraj Sharma (PW/7) are inconsistent and\nlots of discrepancies are there. The prosecution story is unnatural.\nThere is no any evidence against the present appellants. The\npresent case is the case of no evidence. The appellants have not\ncommitted any offence. There was no pre-mediation or pre-\nmeeting of mind. There is no eyewitness in the case. The entire\nprosecution story is based on mere surmises and conjunctures\nwherein the present appellants have been roped up. The dead body\nwas recovered from the house of Shankar Singh Gurjar which was\nlocked from outside. As per the postmortem report the deceased\nwas strangulated, but there is no any evidence of committing the\naforesaid act by the appellants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">7.           It is also submitted by the learned counsel for the\nappellants that Neeraj Sharma (PW/7) is the father of the deceased\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                             -(7)            CRA No. 625/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                            CRA No. 713/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                            CRA No.1046/2014</span>\n\n\n\n\nwhose statement was recorded on 27.11.2007. However, in his\nentire statement he has not disclosed the name of the present\nappellants who have participated in the alleged commission of\nmurder. Rather he has admitted that there was no enmity between\nhim and Sonu @ Shailendra Sharma. There is no any ingredient of\n<a href=\"/doc/1374258/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 364-A</a> of IPC. Therefore, <a href=\"/doc/1374258/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 364-A</a> of IPC is not\nmade out. Similarly, <a href=\"/doc/159017851/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 11</a>/<a href=\"/doc/170156328/\" id=\"a_37\">13</a> of MPDVPK Act is also not\nmade out as the prosecution is lacking of ingredients of aforesaid\nSections. The appellants have been roped in this case only on the\nbasis of hearsay evidence. There is no complete chain of\ncircumstantial evidence against the appellants. Hence, prayed to\nallow the appeals.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">8.          Per Contra, learned State Counsel opposed the\nsubmissions and submitted that the prosecution has proved its case\nbeyond reasonable doubt and there is sufficient evidence against\nthe appellants. There is specific chain is made out of\ncircumstantial   evidence   and    the   scientific   evidence   also\ncorroborates the prosecution evidence. Hence, prayed for rejection\nof the Criminal Appeal No.625/2009 and Criminal Appeal\nNo.713/2009 filed by the appellants Raghuveer Savita and\nShailendra Sharma.

A bare perusal of the section makes it crystal clear that\nthe first and the second clauses of the section refer to intention\napart from the knowledge and the third clause refers to knowledge\nalone and not the intention. Both the expression &quot;intent&quot; and\n&quot;knowledge&quot; postulate the existence of a positive mental attitude\nwhich is of different degrees. The mental element in culpable\nhomicide i.e., mental attitude towards the consequences of conduct\nis one of intention and knowledge.

An act is said to cause death results either\nfrom the act directly or results from some consequences\nnecessarily or naturally flowing from such act and reasonably\ncontemplated as its result. Nature of offence does not only depend\nupon the location of injury by the accused, this intention is to be\ngathered from all facts and circumstances of the case. If injury is\non the vital part, i.e., chest or head, according to medical evidence\nthis injury proved fatal. It is relevant to mention here that intention\nis question of fact which is to be gathered from the act of the party.\nAlong with the aforesaid, ingredient of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 300</a> of IPC are also\nrequired to be fulfilled for commission of offence of murder.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">24.

The question with regard to the nature\n               of offence has to be determined on the facts and\n               in the circumstances of each case. The nature of\n               the injury, whether it is on the vital or non-vital\n               part of the body, the weapon used, the\n               circumstances in which the injury is caused and\n               the manner in which the injury is inflicted are all\n               relevant factors which may go to determine the\n               required intention or knowledge of the offender\n               and the offence committed by him.

The said\n               exception deals with a case of prosecution not\n               covered by the first exception, after which its\n               place would have been more appropriate. The\n               exception is founded upon the same principle, for\n               in both there is absence of premeditation. But,\n               while in the case of Exception 1 there is total\n               deprivation of self-control, in case of Exception\n               4, there is only that heat of passion which clouds\n               men&#x27;s sober reason and urges them to deeds\n               which they would not otherwise do. There is\n               provocation in Exception 4 as in Exception 1; but\n               the injury done is not the direct consequence of\n               that provocation. In fact Exception 4 deals with\n               cases in which notwithstanding that a blow may\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                      -( 18 )-       CRA No. 625/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                    CRA No. 713/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                    CRA No.1046/2014</span>\n\n\n\n\n       have been struck, or some provocation given in\n       the origin of the dispute or in whatever way the\n       quarrel may have originated, yet the subsequent\n       conduct of both parties puts them in respect of\n       guilt upon equal footing. A &#x27;sudden fight&#x27; implies\n       mutual provocation and blows on each side. The\n       homicide committed is then clearly not traceable\n       to unilateral provocation, nor in such cases could\n       the whole blame be placed on one side. For if it\n       were so, the Exception more appropriately\n       applicable would be Exception 1. There is no\n       previous deliberation or determination to fight. A\n       fight suddenly takes place, for which both parties\n       are more or less to be blamed. It may be that one\n       of them starts it, but if the other had not\n       aggravated it by his own conduct it would not\n       have taken the serious turn it did. There is then\n       mutual provocation and aggravation, and it is\n       difficult to apportion the share of blame which\n       attaches to each fighter. The help of Exception 4\n       can be invoked if death is caused (a) without\n       premeditation, (b) in a sudden fight; (c) without\n       the offender&#x27;s having taken undue advantage or\n       acted in a cruel or unusual manner; and (d) the\n       fight must have been with the person killed. To\n       bring a case within Exception 4 all the\n       ingredients mentioned in it must be found. It is to\n       be noted that the &#x27;fight&#x27; occurring in Exception 4\n       to <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 300</a>, IPC is not defined in the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_86\">IPC</a>. It\n       takes two to make a fight. Heat of passion\n       requires that there must be no time for the\n       passions to cool down and in this case, the parties\n       have worked themselves into a fury on account of\n       the verbal altercation in the beginning. A fight is\n       a combat between two and more persons whether\n       with or without weapons. It is not possible to\n       enunciate any general rule as to what shall be\n       deemed to be a sudden quarrel. It is a question of\n       fact and whether a quarrel is sudden or not must\n       necessarily depend upon the proved facts of each\n       case. For the application of Exception 4, it is not\n       sufficient to show that there was a sudden quarrel\n       and there was no premeditation. It must further be\n       shown that the offender has not taken undue\n       advantage or acted in cruel or unusual manner.\n       The expression &#x27;undue advantage&#x27; as used in the\n       provision means &#x27;unfair advantage&#x27;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">28.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1173740\" id=\"span_56\">In <a href=\"/doc/1173740/\" id=\"a_87\">Pulicherla Nagaraju @ Nagaraja vs. State of AP</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">                              -( 19 )-       CRA No. 625/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                            CRA No. 713/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                            CRA No.1046/2014</span>\n\n\n\n\n[(2006) 11 SCC 444, while deciding whether a case falls under\nSection 302 or 304 Part-I or 304 Part-II, <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_88\">IPC</a>, it was held thus :-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">              &quot;Therefore, the court should proceed to decide the\n              pivotal question of intention, with care and\n              caution, as that will decide whether the case falls\n              under Section 302 or 304 Part I or 304 Part II.\n              Many petty or insignificant matters plucking of a\n              fruit, straying of a cattle, quarrel of children,\n              utterance of a rude word or even an objectionable\n              glance, may lead to altercations and group clashes\n              culminating in deaths.

In our opinion, as nobody can enter into the\n              mind of the accused, his intention has to be\n              gathered from the weapon used, the part of the\n              body chosen for the assault and the nature of the\n              injuries caused. Here, the appellant had chosen a\n              crowbar as the weapon of offence. He has further\n              chosen a vital part of the body i.e. the head for\n              causing the injury which had caused multiple\n              fractures of skull. This clearly shows the force\n              with which the appellant had used the weapon.\n              The cumulative effect of all these factors\n              irresistibly leads to one and the only conclusion\n              that the appellant intended to cause death of the\n              deceased.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">30.          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69018506\" id=\"span_63\">In <a href=\"/doc/69018506/\" id=\"a_90\">State of Rajasthan v.

The nature of the offence would certainly\ndepend upon the other attendant circumstances\nwhich would help the court to find out definitely\nabout the intention on the part of the accused.\nSuch attendant circumstances could be very\nmany, they being (i) whether the act was\npremeditated; (ii) the nature of weapon used; (iii)\nthe nature of assault on the accused. This is\ncertainly not an exhaustive list and every case has\nto necessarily depend upon the evidence\navailable. As regards the user of screwdriver, the\nlearned counsel urged that it was only an\naccidental use on the spur of the moment and,\ntherefore, there could be no intention to either\ncause death or cause such bodily injury as would\nbe sufficient to cause death.

Offence of\nKidnapping for lawful guardianship is defined under\nSection 361 and Section 363 provides for\npunishment for kidnapping. Section 364 deals with\nkidnapping or abduction in order to murder.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">10. The Law Commission of India took up the\nrevision of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_122\">Indian Penal Code</a> and submitted its\nreport, i.e., 42nd Report (June, 1971). In Chapter 16,\noffences affecting the human body was dealt with.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">The chapter on kidnapping and abduction was dealt\nby the Commission in paragraphs 16.91 to 16.112.\nSection 364 and 364A was dealt by the Commission\nin paragraphs 16.99 to 16.100 which are as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">              &quot;16.99.

In view\n     of our general recommendation as to\n     imprisonment for life, we propose that life\n     imprisonment should be omitted and term\n     imprisonment increased to 14 years.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">           The illustrations to the section do not\n     elucidate any particular ingredient of the\n     offence and should be omitted.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">           16.100. We consider it desirable to have\n     a specific section to punish severely\n     kidnapping or abduction for ransom, as such\n     cases are increasing. At present, such\n     kidnapping or abduction is punishable under\n     section 365 since the kidnapped or abducted\n     person will be secretly and wrongfully\n     confined.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">           We also considered the question whether\n     a provision for reduced punishment in case of\n     release of the person kidnapped without harm\n     should be inserted, but we have come to the\n     conclusion that there is no need for it. We\n     propose the following section:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">             &quot;364A. Kidnapping or abduction for\n             ransom .--Whoever kidnaps or\n             abducts any person with intent to\n             hold that person for ransom shall be\n             punished with rigorous imprison-\n             ment for a term which may extend to\n             14 years, and shall also be liable to\n             fine.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">11. Although the Law Commission has in\nparagraph 16.100 proposed Section 364A, which\nonly stated that whoever kidnaps or abducts any\nperson with intent to hold that person for ransom be\npunished for a term which may extend to 14 years.\nParliament while inserting Section 364A by Act\nNo.42 of 1993 enacted the provision in a broader\nmanner also to include kidnapping and abduction to\ncompel the Government to do or abstain from doing\nany act or to pay a ransom which was further\namended and amplified by Act No.24 of 1995.\nSection 364A as it exists after amendment is as\nfollows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">             &quot;364A.

We may now look into section 364A to find\nout as to what ingredients the Section itself\ncontemplate for the offence. When we paraphrase\nSection 364A following is deciphered:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">     (i)   &quot;Whoever kidnaps or abducts any person\n           or keeps a person in detention after such\n           kidnapping or abduction&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">     (ii) &quot;and threatens to cause death or hurt to\n           such person, or by his conduct gives rise\n           to a reasonable apprehension that such\n           person may be put to death or hurt,\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">     (iii) or causes hurt or death to such person in\n           order to compel the Government or any\n           foreign State or international inter-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">           governmental organisation or any other\n           person to do or abstain from doing any\n           act or to pay a ransom&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">     (iv) &quot;shall be punishable with death, or\n           imprisonment for life, and shall also be\n           liable to fine.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">13. The first essential condition as incorporated in\nSection 364A is &quot;whoever kidnaps or abducts any\nperson or keeps a person in detention after such\nkidnapping or abduction&quot;. The second condition\nbegins with conjunction &quot;and&quot;. The second\ncondition has also two parts, i.e., (a) threatens to\ncause death or hurt to such person or (b) by his\nconduct gives rise to a reasonable apprehension that\nsuch person may be put to death or hurt. Either part\nof above condition, if fulfilled, shall fulfill the\nsecond condition for offence. The third condition\nbegins with the word &quot;or&quot;, i.e., or causes hurt or\ndeath to such person in order to compel the\nGovernment or any foreign State or international\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">                -( 29 )-       CRA No. 625/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                              CRA No. 713/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                              CRA No.1046/2014</span>\n\n\n\n\ninter-governmental organisation or any other person\nto do or abstain from doing any act or to pay a\nransom. Third condition begins with the word &quot;or\ncauses hurt or death to such person in order to\ncompel the Government or any foreign state to do or\nabstain from doing any act or to pay a ransom&quot;.\nSection 364A contains a heading &quot;kidnapping for\nransom, etc.&quot; The kidnapping by a person to demand\nransom is fully covered by Section 364A.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">14. We have noticed that after the first condition\nthe second condition is joined by conjunction &quot;and&quot;,\nthus, whoever kidnaps or abducts any person or\nkeeps a person in detention after such kidnapping or\nabduction and threatens to cause death or hurt to\nsuch person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">15. The use of conjunction &quot;and&quot; has its purpose\nand object. Section 364A uses the word &quot;or&quot; nine\ntimes and the whole section contains only one\nconjunction &quot;and&quot;, which joins the first and second\ncondition. Thus, for covering an offence under\nSection 364A, apart from fulfillment of first\ncondition, the second condition, i.e., &quot;and threatens\nto cause death or hurt to such person&quot; also needs to\nbe proved in case the case is not covered by\nsubsequent clauses joined by &quot;or&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">16. The word &quot;and&quot; is used as conjunction. The\nuse of word &quot;or&quot; is clearly distinctive. Both the\nwords have been used for different purpose and\nobject. Crawford on Interpretation of Law while\ndealing with the subject &quot;disjunctive&quot; and\n&quot;conjunctive&quot; words with regard to criminal statute\nmade following statement:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">               &quot;..........................The Court\n           should be extremely reluctant in a\n           criminal     statute    to    substitute\n           disjunctive words for cojunctive\n           words, and vice versa, if such action\n           adversely affects the accused.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">17.

This court held that when the provisos 1 &amp; 2\nare separated by conjunctive word &quot;and&quot;, they have\nto be read conjointly. The requirement of both the\nproviso has to be satisfied to avail the benefit.\nParagraph 8 is as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">       &quot;8. The language of the rule is plain and\n       simple. It does not admit of any doubt in\n       interpretation. Provisos (i) and (ii) are\n       separated by the use of the conjunction &quot;and&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_66\">       They have to be read conjointly. The\n       requirement of both the provisos has to be\n       satisfied to avail the benefit. Clauses (a) and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">       (b) of proviso (ii) are separated by the use of\n       an &quot;or&quot; and there the availability of one of the\n       two alternatives would suffice. Inasmuch as\n       cement and asbestos fibre used by the\n       appellants in the manufacture of their finished\n       excisable goods are liable to duty under\n       different tariff items, the benefit of pro forma\n       credit extended by Rule 56-A cannot be\n       availed of by the appellants and has been\n       rightly denied by the authorities of the\n       Department.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">21. Thus, applying the above principle of\ninterpretation on condition Nos. 1 &amp; 2 of Section\n364A which is added with conjunction &quot;and&quot;, we are\nof the view that condition No.2 has also to be\nfulfilled before ingredients of Section 364A are\nfound to be established. Section 364A also indicates\nthat in case the condition &quot;and threatens to cause\ndeath or hurt to such person&quot; is not proved, there are\nother classes which begins with word &quot;or&quot;, those\nconditions, if proved, the offence will be established.\nThe second condition, thus, as noted above is\ndivided in two parts- (a) and threatens to cause death\nor hurt to such person or (b) by his conduct gives\nrise to a reasonable apprehension that such person\nmay be put to death or hurt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"731985\" id=\"span_116\">22. Now, we may look into few cases of this Court\nwhere different ingredients of Section 364A came\nfor consideration. We may first notice the judgment\nof this Court in <a href=\"/doc/731985/\" id=\"a_129\">Malleshi Vs. State of Karnataka</a>,\n(2004) 8 SCC 95. The above was a case where\nkidnapping of a major boy was made by the accused\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_117\">                -( 34 )-       CRA No. 625/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                              CRA No. 713/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                              CRA No.1046/2014</span>\n\n\n\n\nfor ransom and before this Court argument was\nraised that demand of ransom has not been\nestablished. In <a href=\"/doc/731985/\" id=\"a_130\">the above case</a>, the Court referred to\nSection 364A and in paragraph 12 following was\nobserved:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"107388289\" id=\"span_120\">&quot;12. To attract the provisions of Section\n        364-A what is required to be proved is: (1)\n        that the accused kidnapped or abducted the\n        person; (2) kept him under detention after\n        such kidnapping and abduction; and (3) that\n        the kidnapping or abduction was for\n        ransom. Strong reliance was placed on a\n        decision of the Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/107388289/\" id=\"a_131\">Netra\n        Pal v. State (NCT of Delhi</a>) [2001 Cri LJ\n        1669 (Del)] to contend that since the ransom\n        demand was not conveyed to the father of\n        PW 2, the intention to demand was not\n        fulfilled.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">23. This court in paragraphs 13 to 15 dealt with\ndemand for ransom and held that demand originally\nwas made to person abducted and the mere fact that\nafter making the demand the same could not be\nconveyed to some other person as the accused was\narrested in meantime does not take away the effect of\nconditions of Section 364A. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"107388289\" id=\"span_121\">In <a href=\"/doc/107388289/\" id=\"a_132\">the above case</a>, this\nCourt was merely concerned with ransom, hence,\nother conditions of Section 364A were not noticed.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"889187\" id=\"span_122\">24.

In <a href=\"/doc/889187/\" id=\"a_134\">the above case</a>,\nthis Court noticed the ingredients for commission of\noffence under Section 364 and 364A.

At this stage, we may also notice the judgment\nof this Court in Suman Sood alias Kamaljeet Kaur\nVs. State of Rajasthan (2007) 5 SCC 634. In the\nabove case, Suman Sood and her husband Daya\nSingh Lahoria were accused in the case of abduction.\nThey were tried for offence under Section 364A,\n365, 343 read with Section 120-B and 346 read with\nSection 120-B. The trial court convicted the\nappellant for offence under Sections 365 read with\n120-B, 343 read with 120-B and 346 read with 120-\nB. She was, however, acquitted for offence\npunishable under Section 364-A. Her challenge\nagainst conviction and sentence for offences\npunishable under Sections 365 read with 120- B, 343\nread with 120-B and 346 read with 120-B <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_136\">IPC</a> was\nnegatived by the High Court. But her acquittal for\noffences punishable under Sections 364-A read with\n120-B was set aside by the High Court in an appeal\nand she was also convicted for the offence under\nSection 364A and was sentenced to life\nimprisonment. In the appeal filed by her challenging\nher conviction under Section 364A, this Court dealt\nwith acquittal of Suman Sood under Section 364A by\ntrial Court. In Paragraph 64 this court noticed as\nfollows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">       &quot;64. According to the trial court, the\n       prosecution had failed to prove charges\n       against Suman Sood for an offence\n       punishable under Sections 364-A or 364-A\n       read with 120-B <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_137\">IPC</a> &quot;beyond reasonable\n       doubt&quot; inasmuch as no reliable evidence\n       had been placed on record from which it\n       could be said to have been established that\n       Suman Sood was also a part of &quot;pressurise\n       tactics&quot; or had terrorised the victim or his\n       family members to get Devendra Pal Singh\n       Bhullar released in lieu of Rajendra\n       Mirdha. The trial court, therefore, held that\n       she was entitled to benefit of doubt.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">26. The findings of trial court that no reliable\nevidence had been placed on record from which it\ncould be said to have been established that Suman\nSood was also a part of pressurise tactics or has\nterrorized the victim or his family. This court\napproved the acquittal of Suman Sood by trial court\nand set aside the order of the High Court convicting\nSuman Sood. In paragraph 71 following was held by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                 -( 36 )-       CRA No. 625/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                               CRA No. 713/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">                               CRA No.1046/2014</span>\n\n\n\n\nthis Court:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">       &quot;71. On the facts and in the circumstances\n       in its entirety and considering the evidence\n       as a whole, it cannot be said that by\n       acquitting Suman Sood for offences\n       punishable under Sections 364-A read with\n       120-B <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_138\">IPC</a>, the trial court had acted\n       illegally or unlawfully. The High Court,\n       therefore, ought not to have set aside the\n       finding of acquittal of accused Suman Sood\n       for an offence under Sections 364-A read\n       with 120-B <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_139\">IPC</a>. To that extent, therefore,\n       the order of conviction and sentence\n       recorded by the High Court deserves to be\n       set aside.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">27. Thus, the trial court&#x27;s findings that there was\nno evidence that Suman Sood was part of pressurize\ntactics or terrorized the victim or his family\nmembers, hence, due to non-fulfillment of the\ncondition as enumerated in Section 364A, the trial\ncourt recorded the acquittal, which has been\nconfirmed by this Court. The above case clearly\nestablishes that unless all conditions as enumerated\nin Section 364A are fulfilled, no conviction can be\nrecorded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1357429\" id=\"span_129\">28. Now, we come to next judgment, i.e.,\n<a href=\"/doc/1357429/\" id=\"a_140\">Vishwanath Gupta Vs. State of Uttaranchal</a> (2007)\n11 SCC 633. In <a href=\"/doc/1357429/\" id=\"a_141\">the above case</a>, the victims were\nabducted from district of Lucknow, State of U.P.\ndemands for ransom and threat was extended from\nanother district, i.e., Nainital and the victim was\ndone to death in another district, i.e., Unnao in the\nState of U.P. This Court had occasion to consider the\ningredients of Section 364A and in paragraphs 8 and\n9, the following was laid down:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1357429\" id=\"span_130\">&quot;8. According to Section 364-A, whoever\n           kidnaps or abducts any person and keeps\n           him in detention and threatens to cause\n           death or hurt to such person and by his\n           conduct gives rise to a reasonable\n           apprehension that such person may be\n           put to death or hurt, and claims a ransom\n           and if death is caused then <a href=\"/doc/1357429/\" id=\"a_142\">in that case</a>\n           the accused can be punished with death\n           or imprisonment for life and also liable to\n           pay fine.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">           9. The important ingredient of Section\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                -( 37 )-        CRA No. 625/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                               CRA No. 713/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                               CRA No.1046/2014</span>\n\n\n\n\n         364-A is the abduction or kidnapping, as\n         the case may be. Thereafter, a threat to\n         the kidnapped/abducted that if the\n         demand for ransom is not met then the\n         victim is likely to be put to death and in\n         the event death is caused, the offence of\n         Section 364-A is complete. There are\n         three stages in this section, one is the\n         kidnapping or abduction, second is threat\n         of death coupled with the demand of\n         money and lastly when the demand is not\n         met, then causing death. If the three\n         ingredients are available, that will\n         constitute the offence under Section 364-\n         A of the Penal Code. Any of the three\n         ingredients can take place at one place or\n         at different places. In the present case the\n         demand of the money with the threat\n         perception had been made at (Haldwani)\n         Nainital. The deceased were kidnapped at\n         Lucknow and they were put to death at\n         Unnao. Therefore, the first offence was\n         committed by the accused when they\n         abducted Ravi Varshney and Anoop\n         Samant at Lucknow. Therefore, Lucknow\n         court could have territorial jurisdiction to\n         try the case.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1357429\" id=\"span_134\">29. This Court <a href=\"/doc/1357429/\" id=\"a_143\">in <a href=\"/doc/1357429/\" id=\"a_144\">the above case</a></a>, laid down that\nthere are three stages in the Section, one is\nkidnapping or abduction, second is threat of death\ncoupled with demand of money and third when the\ndemand is not met, then causing death. The Court\nheld that if the three ingredients are available that\nwill constitute the offence under <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 364</a> of the\nIPC. Dealing with Section 364A in context of above\ncase, following was <a href=\"/doc/1357429/\" id=\"a_146\">laid down in</a> paragraph 17:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">           &quot;17. ...............But here, in the case of\n          Section 364-A something more is there,\n          that is, that a person was abducted from\n          Lucknow and demand has been raised at\n          Haldwani, Nainital with threat. If the\n          amount is not paid to the abductor then\n          the victim is likely to be put to death. In\n          order to constitute an offence under\n          Section 364-A, all the ingredients have\n          not taken place at Lucknow or Unnao.\n          The two incidents took place in the State\n          of Uttar Pradesh, that is, abduction and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">                 -( 38 )-       CRA No. 625/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">                               CRA No. 713/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                               CRA No.1046/2014</span>\n\n\n\n\n         death of the victims but one of the\n         ingredient took place, that is, threat was\n         given at the house of the victims at\n         Haldwani, Nainital demanding the\n         ransom money otherwise the victim will\n         be put to death. Therefore, one of the\n         ingredients has taken place within the\n         territorial jurisdiction of Haldwani,\n         Nainital. Therefore, it is a case wherein\n         the offence has taken place at three\n         places i.e. at Haldwani, Nainital, where\n         the threat to the life of the victim was\n         given and demand of money was raised,\n         the victim was abducted from Lucknow\n         and he was ultimately put to death at\n         Unnao. ......................&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"59677904\" id=\"span_138\">30.

In\n<a href=\"/doc/176050109/\" id=\"a_151\">the above case</a>, an eight year old son of Doctor\nMukesh Ramanlal Chandak (PW1) was kidnapped\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">                 -( 39 )-       CRA No. 625/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                               CRA No. 713/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">                               CRA No.1046/2014</span>\n\n\n\n\nby the accused A1 and A2. Accused A1 was an\nemployee of Dr. Chandak. It was held that A1 had\ngrievance against Dr. Chandak. A2 who\naccompanied A1 when the boy was kidnapped and\nafter the kidnapping of the boy it was found that boy\nwas murdered and at the instance of A1, the dead\nbody was recovered from a bridge constructed over a\nRivulet. Trial court had sentenced both A1 and A2 to\ndeath for the offences punishable under Sections\n364A read with 34 and 302 read with 34. The High\nCourt had dismissed the appeal affirming the death\nsentence. On behalf of A2, one of the arguments\nraised before this Court was that although child was\nkidnapped for ransom but there was no intention to\ntake the life of the child, therefore, offence under\nSection 364A is not made out. This Court noticed the\ningredients of Section 364A, one of which was\n&quot;threatening to cause death or hurt&quot; in paragraphs\n90, 91 and 92, the following was observed:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">          &quot;90. An argument was raised that the child\n          was kidnapped for ransom but there was\n          no intention to take life of the child,\n          therefore, an offence under Section 364A\n          is not made out. To appreciate the\n          arguments, <a href=\"/doc/1374258/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 364A</a> of the IPC is\n          reproduced as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_92\">                &quot;364A.

The kidnapping of an 8-year-old child\n        was unequivocally for ransom. The\n        kidnapping of a victim of such a tender\n        age for ransom has inherent threat to\n        cause death as that alone will force the\n        relatives of such victim to pay ransom.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">        Since the act of kidnapping of a child for\n        ransom has inherent threat to cause death,\n        therefore, the accused have been rightly\n        been convicted for an offence under\n        Section 364A read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_154\">Section 34</a> IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">        The threat will remain a mere threat, if the\n        victim returns unhurt. In the present case,\n        the victim has been done to death. The\n        threat had become a reality. There is no\n        reason to take different view that the view\n        taken by learned Sessions Judge as well\n        by the High Court.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">32. We need to refer to observations made by\nThree Judge Bench in paragraph 92 where this Court\nobserved that kidnapping of an eight year old victim\nfor ransom has inherent threat to cause death as it\nalone will force the relatives of victim to pay\nransom. The <a href=\"/doc/176050109/\" id=\"a_155\">Court further held</a> that since the act of\nkidnapping of a child has inherent threat to cause\ndeath, therefore, the accused have been rightly\nconvicted for an offence under Section 364A read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_156\">Section 34</a> IPC. In the next sentence, the Court\nheld that the threat will remain a mere threat, if the\nvictim returns unhurt, &quot;the victim has been done to\ndeath the threat has become a reality&quot;. The above\nobservation made by Three Judge Bench has to be\nread in context of the facts of the case which was for\nconsideration before this Court. No ratio has been\n<a href=\"/doc/176050109/\" id=\"a_157\">laid down in</a> paragraph 92 that when an eight year\nold child (or a child of a tender age) is\nkidnapped/abducted for ransom there is inherent\nthreat to cause death and the second condition as\nnoted above, i.e., threatens to cause death or hurt to\nsuch person, is not to be proved. The observations\ncannot be read to mean that in a case of kidnapping\nor abduction of an eight year old child (or child of a\ntender age), presumption in law shall arise that\nkidnapping or abduction has been done to cause hurt\nor death. Each case has to be decided on its own\nfacts. In the foregoing paragraphs, we have noticed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_146\">                             -( 41 )-        CRA No. 625/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_147\">                                            CRA No. 713/2009</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_148\">                                            CRA No.1046/2014</span>\n\n\n\n\n            that all the three distinct conditions enumerated in\n            Section 364A have to be fulfilled before an accused\n            is convicted of offence under Section 364A. Thus,\n            the observations in paragraph 92 may not be read to\n            obviate the establishment of second condition as\n            noticed above for bringing home the offence under\n            Section 364A.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">39.         <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 149</a> of Indian Penal Code runs as under :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_94\">                &quot;149.

For recording a conclusion that a person is guilty of\nany offence under <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_160\">Section 149</a> of IPC, it must be proved that such\nperson is a member of an &quot;unlawful assembly&quot; consisting of not\nless than five persons irrespective of the fact whether the identity\nof each one of the five persons is proved or not. If that fact is\nproved, the next step of inquiry is whether the common object of\nthe unlawful assembly is one of the five enumerated objects\nspecified under <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_161\">Section 141</a> of IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_87\">42.

Where common object of an unlawful\n                   assembly is not proved, the accused persons\n                   cannot be convicted with the help of\n                   Section 149. The crucial question to\n                   determine is whether the assembly\n                   consisted of five or more persons and\n                   whether the said persons entertained one or\n                   more of the common objects, as specified in\n                   Section 141. It cannot be laid down as a\n                   general proposition of law that unless an\n                   overt act is proved against a person, who is\n                   alleged to be a member of unlawful\n                   assembly, it cannot be said that he is a\n                   member of an assembly. The only thing\n                   required is that he should have understood\n                   that the assembly was unlawful and was\n                   likely to commit any of the acts which fall\n                   within the purview of Section 141. The\n                   word &#x27;object&#x27; means the purpose or design\n                   and, in order to make it &#x27;common&#x27;, it must\n                   be shared by all. In other words, the object\n                   should be common to the persons, who\n                   compose the assembly, that is to say, they\n                   should all be aware of it and concur in it. A\n                   common object may be formed by express\n                   agreement after mutual consultation, but\n                   that is by no means necessary. It may be\n                   formed at any stage by all or a few members\n                   of the assembly and the other members may\n                   just join and adopt it. Once formed, it need\n                   not continue to be the same. It may be\n                   modified or altered or abandoned at any\n                   stage.

Learned counsel for the appellants have also\nsubmitted that there are lots of contradictions and omissions in the\nstatements given by the prosecution witnesses.

Learned counsel for the appellants have also\nsubmitted that Sonu (PW/4) has not supported the prosecution\ncase.

The evidence of such witnesses cannot be treated as\neffaced or washed off the record altogether, but the same can be\naccepted to the extent their version is found to be dependable on a\ncareful scrutiny thereof.

It is also submitted by the\nlearned counsel for the appellants that the prosecution case is that\nthe dead body was recovered from the house locked from outside\nand its lock was broken by using force and the seized lock was\npressure marked from one side. But the lock sent for FSL\nexamination was different as in FSL report the scientist has\nsubmitted in its report that there was no any pressure mark on the\nseized lock. But again this argument has no force as the\nprosecution story is that the lock was broken. However, breaking\nof lock or opening of lock is not material as the dead body was\nrecovered from inside of Bukhari of this house and the Bukhari\nwas shut down with the help of wall of bricks and cement.\nTherefore, the trial Court has rightly held that the aforesaid act was\nnot done with ulterior motive and reflects the criminal\nmotive/modus operandi of the appellants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_107\">61.   As discussed above, Moharman Lal has specifically stated in\nhis statement that as retiral dues he received Rs.4 Lacs and this fact\nwas in the knowledge of accused/appellants and the demand of\nransom on telephone was received by his daughter-in-law Manoj.\nIt is true that the daughter-in-law Manoj has not been examined by\nthe prosecution in this case. But there is a complete chain of\ncircumstantial evidence in the present case and the dead body was\nrecovered under the exceptional circumstances from the Bukhari\nand as per memorandum of accused/appellants articles were\nrecovered/seized and as per scientific evidence reports, chain of\ncircumstantial evidence is complete. Therefore, the trial Court has\nrightly observed that non-examining of witness Manoj (daughter-\nin-law) is non fatal to the prosecution case.
