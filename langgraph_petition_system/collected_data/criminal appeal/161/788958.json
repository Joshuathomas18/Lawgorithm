This letter was actually delivered to, Mangilal&#x27;s\t son\nLaduram who, on reading it, found that it purported to\thave\nbeen sent by &quot; Bhayankar Daku Dal &quot; demanding payment of Rs.\n5,000 at 6-30 p.m. on the 17th of July at the -crossing near\nthe 27th milestone on the Ajmer-Bijainagar road and  -saying\nthat  &quot;\t if you cheat or do 420 or in case  you\t inform\t the\npolice,\t no  other punishment except that of death  will  be\nmeted  out to you and you will be shot dead and made to\t lie\non  the ground.&quot; Laduram took the .original letter with\t the\nenvelope  to his uncle Ramjas at Ajmer and both of them\t saw\nthe Superintendent of Police and gave him the letter and the\nenvelope   and\t asked\t for   immediate   protection\t and\ninvestigation.\tThe Superintendent of Police, however,\ttook\nno  action in this behalf.  Mangilal failed to\tcomply\twith\nthe  demand  ,to pay.. On the 17th of July about  9-30\tp.m.\nwhen he was sitting at his shop and his inunim Gajanand\t was\nwriting the accounts two persons came from the\tneighbouring\nstreet.\t  One  of them was dressed in a khaki suit  and\t the\nother  in  a  blue  suit.  The man  in\tblue  demanded\tfrom\nMangilal  a  reply  to the letter, while the  man  in  khaki\nentered\t the  shop  and removed\t Mangilal&#x27;s  gun  which\t was\nhanging in a canvas case from a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">147</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">1136</span>\npeg  on the wall of the shop.  On Mangilal&#x27;s  replying\tthat\nhis  son Laduram had taken the letter to Ajmer,\t the  person\ndressed in blue fired from a Mauser pistol and shot Mangilal\ndead.\tThe two assailants then ran away.  On the  way\tthey\nthrew the Mauser pistol and khaki clothes in the street at a\nshort  distance\t from  the  shop.   Mangilal  died   shortly\nafterwards.  The first information report was lodged by Nand\nLal (P.\t W.1) immediately after the occurrence at 9-45\tp.m.\nIn  this  report Nand Lal described the\t occurrence  in\t the\nfollowing terms :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;  From\t the  lane two men, one of whom\t was  wearing  khaki\nclothes having a hat on the head and the. other wearing blue\nclothes with a blue cap on the head came near Mangilalji and\nstood  there.  The man with khaki clothes said something  to\nMangilal and the man with blue clothes went straight  inside\nthe  shop and picked up Mangilal&#x27;s gun from behind the\tdoor\nshutter\t and  brought it out and stood near the\t khaki\tclad\nman, and at that time shot Mangilal with a pistol he had.  &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">  The  prosecution  challaned four persons, viz.,  Hem\tRaj,\nappellant  in Criminal Appeal No. 58 of 1953,  Hukum  Singh,\nrespondent  in Criminal Appeal No. 87 of 1953,\tMilap  Singh\nand  Abdul Hakim.  It was alleged that all the four of\tthem\nhad  acted  in\tconspiracy and\trealised,  money  from\trich\npersons through threatening letters and in pursuance of\t the\nconspiracy  Exhibit P-5 was sent.  Hem Raj and\tHukum  Singh\nwere arrested on the evening of the 26th July at  Bijainagar\nand  were  sent to jail on the 28th of July, 1952.   On\t the\n30th of July, 1952, Hem Raj made a confession in jail before\na  Magistrate.\tOn the 5th of September, 1952, at the  first\nhearing\t of the case before the committing  Magistrate,\t the\nconfession  was\t retracted by means of an  application\tmade\nthrough\t counsel and a number of grounds were given why\t the\nconfession  was inadmissible and not of any value.  All\t the\naccused\t persons denied the charge.  Milap Singh  and  Abdul\nHakim were acquitted by the learned Sessions Judge who\thow-\never  convicted\t Hem Raj and Hukum Singh  of  the  different\noffences with which they had been charged. Hem Raj and Hukum\nSingh appealed to the Judicial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">1137</span>\nCommissioner at Ajmer.\tHukum Singh&#x27;s appeal was allowed but\nthat of Hem Raj was dismissed.\tAs stated already, Hem Raj&#x27;s\nappeal before us is by special leave and the State has\talso\nappealed against the acquittal of Hukum Singh and that\talso\nby special leave.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">   Dr. Tek Chand for Hem Raj raised three points before\t us:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">(1)  That the confession was inadmissible in  evidence,\t the\nprosecution having failed to establish affirmatively that it\nwas  free and voluntary and that it was not preceded by\t any\ninducement to the prisoner to make a statement held out by a\nperson\tin  authority.\t It was said that as  no  direct  or\ncircumstantial\tevidence  of  any kind\twas  available,\t the\npolice was straining every nerve to get any one of the\tfour\npersons arrested confess, so that he may be given pardon and\nmade an approver.  The police was particularly keen to\tmake\nsomebody an approver because of their own negligent  conduct\nin  not giving protection to the deceased when Laduram,\t his\nson,  had approached the Superintendent of Police  with\t the\nthreatening letter received by him and that the police\talso\nhad not been able to discover how the pistol had been stolen\nfrom its owner.\t It was contended that Hem Raj was  actually\narrested  on  the 25th July and illegally kept\tin  custody,\nthat  even  after  remand  by  the  Magistrate\the  was\t not\nimmediately  sent to jail but was taken to the house of\t the\nSuperintendent\tof Police and kept there for more than\tfour\nhours,\t that  all  these  circumstances  raised  a   strong\nsuspicion against the voluntary character of the  confession\nand showed that the police was making efforts by threats and\ninducements to extort a confession from him.  It was further\nsuggested that while Hem Raj was in jail the  Superintendent\nof  Police paid him a visit.  There is no relevant  evidence\nto establish this fact.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">   (2)\t  That\tthe Magistrate who recorded  the  confession\ndid  not disclose his identity that he was a  Magistrate  to\nHem Raj and that instead of recording the confession in\t his\ncourt  room  he recorded it in jail without  any  sufficient\ngrounds for doing so and this circumstance also vitiated the\nconfession.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">1138</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(3)  That  there was no independent corroboration of any  of\nthe  material  facts contained in the  confession  and\tthat\nwhatever  material has been considered as  corroboration  by\nthe courts below was already in the possession of the police\nbefore\tthe  confession\t was  recorded\tand  therefore\t the\nconfession  was\t merely\t a  recital  of\t facts\talready\t  in\npossession of the police and was modelled on it and that the\npolice discovered nothing in pursuance of the confession and\ntheir knowledge about the material facts of the case was not\nenriched in any manner by the confession and therefore there\nwas  no\t evidence  whatsoever  in  the\tcase  on  which\t the\nconviction of the appellant could stand.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">    The\t learned  Judicial  Commissioner  as  well  as\tthe,\nlearned Sessions Judge considered all these contentions\t and\nnegatived  them and there were valid reasons for  doing\t so.\nOn the question whether the confession was voluntary,  there\nare concurrent findings of the courts below and there are no\ngrounds\t for going behind these findings.  On  the  question\nwhether\t material  particulars of the confession  have\tbeen\ncorroborated, there are again concurrent findings.  All\t the\narguments  addressed to us relate to the re-appreciation  of\nevidence which had been believed by the courts below and  do\nnot  warrant  interference  by us in the  decisions  of\t the\ncourts\tbelow.\t We  have,  however,  also  examined   these\narguments  independently  and  we  have\t no  hesitation\t  in\nendorsing the views of the courts below.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">   As  regards the voluntary nature of the  confession,\t the\nsignificant fact is that the confession was made on the 30th\nof July, that is, two days after Hem Raj had been lodged  in\njail,  and was not in police custody or amenable  to  police\ninfluence.   He had more than 36 hours to make up  his\tmind\nwhether to make a confession or not.  He is not a rustic but\nruns  a\t cycle shop in Bijainagar.  It\tis  noteworthy\tthat\nHukum  Singh  was  similarly  situated\tand  about  whom  an\napplication  had been made that he was willing\tto  confess.\nWhen  , the Magistrate approached him he said that he  would\nonly  make  a  statement after\tconsulting  his\t lawyer\t and\ndeclined  to make any statement.  Further from the  30th  of\nJuly till the 5th of September no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">1139</span>\nsteps  were taken by Hem Raj to resile from his\t confession.\nThere was ample time at his disposal to make an\t application\nto  the\t Magistrate or to the District\tMagisrate  that\t the\nconfession  had\t been  extorted\t from  him  by\tthreats\t and\ninducement.   On the 5th of September when  an\tapplication\nwas  made by his counsel refracting the confession  it\twas\nmore  in the nature of an argument than in the nature  of  a\ndetailed  statement of the facts and circumstances in  which\nthe  confession had been made.\tWhen examined under  <a href=\"/doc/697591/\" id=\"a_5\">section\n342</a>,  Criminal\tProcedure  Code, he said that  he  made\t the\nconfession  under threats held out by the Superintendent  of\nPolice and Sri Ram Chandra, Sub-Inspector.  He further\tsaid\nthat the Superintendent of Police told him &quot;that if I made a\nconfession  of my guilt, I would be made an approver  ;\t the\nSuperintendent of Police said that he was a Vaishya and as I\ntoo   was  a  Vaishya  he  would  help\tme.   I\t  told\t the\nSuperintendent\tof Police that I would do as he asked me  to\ndo.  About 10-30 a.m. on the 30th of July Sub-Inspector\t Ram\nChandra came to jail and compelled me to make a confession.&quot;\nThe  last portion was clearly a lie as there is no  evidence\nwhatsoever  that  Ram Chandra visited him at  the  time\t the\nMagistrate recorded his confession.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">   The\tMagistrate  who\t recorded the  confession  has\tbeen\nexamined,  and he states that he told the prisoner  that  he\nwas  a\tMagistrate  and\t that  he  complied  with  all\t the\nrequirements  of  law  in  recording  the  confession.\t The\nmemorandum  made by him shows that the\tfollowing  questions\nwere put to Hem Raj: &quot; Do you wish to make a,  confession?&quot;,\nto  which  Hem Raj replied &quot; Yes &quot;. &quot; Are you making  it  of\nyour own free will and without the compulsion of  anybody?&quot;;\nthe answer was &quot; Yes:&quot;.\t The third question was &quot;You are not\nbound to make a confession.  Do you understand this??\tThe\nanswer was &quot;Yes&quot;.  The fourth question. was : &quot; If you\tmake\na confession it maybe used in evidence against you.  Do\t you\nrealize this?&quot; The answer was &quot; Yes &quot;. The last question was\n&quot;  Shall I record your confession ? &quot; The answer was II\t Yes\n&quot;.  It\twas after these queries that a\tconfession  covering\nabout  21  pages and full of details which are\tprecise\t and\ncannot be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">1140</span>\ndescribed as vague was recorded.  The police could not\teven\ndream  of  these details or make an effort to tutor  such  a\ndetailed  confession  to the prisoner and it  is  absolutely\nunthinkable that such a tutored confession could be narrated\nby Hem Raj to the Magistrate after 36 hours of any  possible\nattempt made to tutor him.  As a matter of fact, some of the\nfacts  contained in the confession and indicated later\twere\nnot even known to the police then.  The confession contained\nthe usual endorsement that the confession was voluntary\t and\nall the necessary matters had been explained to the prisoner\nbefore\the made the confession.\t It is significant that\t the\nconfession was not retracted till Hem Raj took legal  advice\nand even then it was not stated who supplied all the details\ncontained  in  the confession to Hem Raj.   The\t allegations\nmade by the prisoner have been denied by the police officers\nexamined and we-are not inclined to accept those allegations\nas  true.   The circumstances relied upon by Dr.  Tek  Chand\nregarding  the\tconduct\t of the police before  Hem  Raj\t was\nlodged in jail do not, in our opinion, affect the  voluntary\ncharacter  of  the  confession.\t  The  contention  that\t the\nMagistrate  did\t not  tell  the\t prisoner  that\t he  was   a\nMagistrate is also belied by the Magistrate&#x27;s evidence.\t  No\ndoubt the confession was recorded in jail though  ordinarily\nit  should have been recorded in the court house,  but\tthat\nirregularity  seems to have, been made because nobody  seems\nto  have realized that\twas the appropriate place to  record\nit  but this circumstance does not affect in this  case\t the\nvoluntary  character of the confession.\t Dr. Tek Chand\tdrew\nour  attention to a quotation from Taylor&#x27;s  Evidence,\t11th\nEdn.,  page 588; par&amp;. 872, and to the decision in Queen  v.\nThompson(1),  in which it had been emphasized that in  order\nthat  evidence\tof  a  confession  by  a  prisoner  may\t  be\nadmissible,  it\t must  be  affirmatively  proved  that\tsuch\nconfession  was\t free  and voluntary and  that\tit  was\t not\npreceded  by  any  inducement  to the  prisoner\t to  make  a\nstatement held out by a person, in authority, or that it was\nnot  made  until  after such  inducement  had  clearly\tbeen\nremoved-.  The\n(1)  [1893] 2 Q.B 12.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">1141</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">principle  laid down in that case is well. settled,  but  we\ndo, not think that Dr. Tek Chand is right in contending that\nthat  principle\t has not been borne in mind  by\t the  courts\nbelow;\tThe mere bald assertion by the prisoner that he\t was\nthreatened, tutored or that inducement. was offered to\thim,\ncannot\tbe  accepted  as true without  more.   There  is  no\nmaterial whatsoever to hold that the prisoner was threatened\nor beaten.  As a fact it has been found by the courts  below\nthat  that assertion was untrue.  The story of tutoring,  on\nthe face of it, is incredible.\tIt was not possible for\t the\npolice or anyone to teach the prisoner all that is contained\nin  the confession.  As regards inducement, again, there  is\nno material whatsoever and the circumstances relied upon are\nnot  such  which raise a suspicion that the  confession\t was\nextorted  by  inducement.  Even if some suspicion  of  this,\ncharacter  could be raised in this case, it has to  be\theld\nthat  the  confession  was made\t after\tthe  inducement\t had\nclearly been removed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">   As  regards the -question whether the confession made  by\nHem  Raj has been corroborated in material  particulars,  we\nare  satisfied\tthat  there is sufficient  evidence  on\t the\nrecord\tto justify the Judicial\t Commissioner&#x27;s\t conclusion.\nP.W. 34, Gajanand, an eye.witness of the occurrence, deposed\nthat  the  man in blue had the pistol and  fired  the  fatal\nshot.  This is in line with what had been stated by Nand Lal\nin  the First Information Report though later on he  made  a\ndifferent statement.  The courts below accepted the evidence\nof  Gajanand in preference to the statement Nand Lal.\tThat\nbeing\tso,  Gajanand&#x27;s\t evidence  fully  corroborates\t the\nconfession  of\tHem Raj that it was he who fired  the  fatal\nshot and that he was dressed in blue uniform.\n   On  the  18th  of  July,  1952,  certain  articles\twere\nrecovered  from Hem Raja house-a hat, a mask., a bush  shirt\nand  a\tpistol.\t  These\t recoveries  are  good\t independent\nevidence  in corroboration of the confession.  On  the\t25th\nJuly,  1952, certain other items were  admittedly  recovered\nfrom  Hem  Rajas  house\t and  these  also  corroborate\t the\nconfession.  Hem Raj also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">1142</span>\ndelivered  to  the  police a black pair of  socks,  a  slate\ncoloured muffler, a blue pair of shorts and a torch.   These\ndeliveries  further  support the confession.   Then  Certain\nrecoveries were made, as stated in the confession, from\t the\nroof of Bansilal&#x27;s shop on 27th of July, 1952.\tThese were a\nrevolver  and a number of cartridges.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1069430\" id=\"span_10\">Lastly there  is\t the\nrecovery of the gun case and the gun.  The learned  Judicial\nCommissioner,  in  these  circumstances,  was  justified  in\nholding that the confession had been corroborated in respect\nof  clothes  worn, by the assailant, and in respect  of\t the\narms and ammunition and that it was also corroborated by the\nremoval of the latch from the shop of Hukum Singh.\nDr.  Tek  Chand contended that the recovery of\tclothes\t and\ndelivery of arms and ammunition by Hem Raj to the police had\nbeen made before the 30th of July , when the confession\t was\nmade,  and  that facts within the knowledge  of\t the  police\nbefore\tthe  confession\t wag  made, could  not\tbe  used  as\nevidence corroborating the confession.\tFor this proposition\nhe placed reliance on a decision of the Oudh Chief Court  in\n<a href=\"/doc/1069430/\" id=\"a_6\">Mata  Din v. The Emperor</a>(1), wherein it was observed that  a\ntrue confession made by a person who takes part in a  murder\ninvariably adds something to the knowledge already possessed\nby  the investigating officer and that is the greatest\ttest\nof its truth.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">   In  our  opinion, the contention raised  by\tthe  learned\ncounsel\t is not were founded.  In the first  instance,it  is\nnot  correct  to  say that all the facts  mentioned  in\t the\nconfession  were  known to the police at the time  when\t the\nconfession was made.  The police did not know anything about\nthe  existence of 30 bore cartridges.  They did not know  as\nto  who had written the letter Exhibit P-5 and did not\tknow\nwho had gone to Beawar to post it.  The police also did\t not\nknow  that  death had been caused by a, shot from  a  Mauser\npistol Exhibit P-19.  Be that as it may ,we see no  validity\nin the contention that a confession can only be corroborated\nby evidence discovered by the police after a confession\t has\nbeen made and any material that is\n(1)A.I.R. 1931 Oudh 166.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">1143</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1069430\" id=\"span_12\">already\t in their possession, cannot be put in\tevidence  in\nsupport of it.\tThe decision in <a href=\"/doc/1069430/\" id=\"a_7\">Mata Dins</a> case(1) does\tnot\nsupport\t the  view  contended  for.   That  decision  merely\nconcerns itself with the value of a confession and does\t not\nrelate\tto the nature and character of evidence that can  be\nled to corroborate it.\tIt does not lay down the proposition\nthat a confession cannot be corroborated by use of materials\nalready\t in possession of the police.  A confession  can  be\nmade -even during a trial and the evidence already recorded\nmay  well be used to corroborate it.  It may be made in\t the\ncourt of the committing Magistrate and materials already  in\npossession  of the police may well be used for\tpurposes  of\ncorroboration.\t The contention therefore that\tevidence  in\npossession  of\tthe police before the confession  was  made,\ncannot\tbe  used  to corroborate  the  confession,  must  be\nrepelled.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">    The result is that the evidence in conjunction with\t the\nconfession  satisfactorily  establishes\t the  charge   under\n<a href=\"/doc/1983271/\" id=\"a_8\">section\t 302</a>/ <a href=\"/doc/387648/\" id=\"a_9\">34</a>, Indian Penal ,Code, against Hem  Raja\t and\nalso  satisfactorily  ves the offence  under  <a href=\"/doc/1183069/\" id=\"a_10\">section  386</a>,\nIndian\tPenal Code.  Dr. Tek Chand very strongly  criticized\nthe  conclusion reached by the Judicial\t Commissioner  that.\nthe letter Exhibit P 5 was posted by Hem Raj.  He  contended\nthat  from the more circumstance that Hem Raj was in  Beawar\non the date the letter was posted it could Dot be  inferred\nthat  it was posted by him.  We think that the criticism  is\nnot  valid and the inference drawn in the  circumstances  of\nthis  case  by\tthe courts below could not  be\tsaid  to  be\nunreasonable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">    As\tregards\t the  State&#x27;s appeal  against  Hukum  Singh,\nclearly\t the  confession  of  Hem Raj  cannot  be  used&#x27;  as\nsubstantive  evidence  against\thim.   The  learned   public\nprosecutor contended that Hukum Singh was the writer of\t the\nletter\tExhibit\t P-5 and the evidence furnished by  the\t key\nExhibit\t P-12 found in his trouser pocket, coupled with\t the\nbreaking of the door latch, and the circumstance that he was\nseen together with Hem Raj, was sufficient material for\t his\nconviction.  We are unable to agree.  We are of the opinion,\nthat the learned Judicial commissioner was perfectly right\n(1) A.I.R. 1931 Oudh 166.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">148</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">1l44\nin holding that this evidence by itself was insufficient  to\nuphold\this conviction and that Hukum Singh was entitled  to\nthe  benefit  of the doubt in respect of  both\tthe  charges\nfound  against\thim.  There is hardly any  material  on\t the\nrecord\tto  justify  our  interference\twith  an  order\t  of\nacquittal in an appeal by special leave.  In the result both\nthese appeals fail and are dismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">\t\t      Appeals dismissed.\n</p>\n\n\n","numcites":6,"numcitedby":40,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":788958,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"all india reporter","formInput":"all%20india%20reporter"},{"value":"corroborative evidence ","formInput":"corroborative%20evidence%20"},{"value":"confession","formInput":"confession"},{"value":"confession before magistrate","formInput":"confession%20before%20magistrate"},{"value":"extortion","formInput":"extortion"},{"value":"recording of confession ","formInput":"recording%20of%20confession%20"},{"value":"art. 136","formInput":"art.%20136"},{"value":"leave to appeal","formInput":"leave%20to%20appeal"},{"value":"confession before police","formInput":"confession%20before%20police"},{"value":"Bijainagar","formInput":"Bijainagar"},{"value":"threat","formInput":"threat"},{"value":"\"judicial commissioner\"","formInput":"%22judicial%20commissioner%22"},{"value":"prisoners","formInput":"prisoners"},{"value":"inducement ","formInput":"inducement%20"},{"value":"tek chand","formInput":"tek%20chand"},{"value":"oudh","formInput":"oudh"},{"value":"leave granted","formInput":"leave%20granted"},{"value":"raja","formInput":"raja"}],"cats":[{"value":"power-to-order-costs","formInput":"tag:power-to-order-costs"},{"value":"order-prosecution","formInput":"tag:order-prosecution"},{"value":"withdrawal-of-power","formInput":"tag:withdrawal-of-power"},{"value":"extortion-by-fear-of-death-or-grievous-hurt","formInput":"tag:extortion-by-fear-of-death-or-grievous-hurt"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
