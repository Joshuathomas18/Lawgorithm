Until 4.00 pm he was in contact with her on phone,\n\nbut he did not return in the evening.                     In the night, at\n\nabout 12.00 O&#x27;clock, she received a call from some unknown\n\nperson on her mobile from the mobile of Pankaj that Pankaj\n\nhad been abducted and if she wanted his release, they will\n\nhave to pay for it.         She wanted to talk to Pankaj, but he\n\ninformed that he had administered chloroform to him.                       She\n\ninformed the above fact to her husband, her daughter Nidhi\n\nand    son-in-law    Abhishek       Rajput,     who      lived   in   Dhanare\n\nColony. She also asked her daughter not to come to her\n\nhouse as abductor had threatened to kill Pankaj if she\n\ninformed anybody.         Her relatives were informed by Abhishek\n\nRajput.     In the morning Abhishek and Nidhi came to her\n\nhouse.    Again she received a call from the abductor making\n\ndemand    of     Rs.80     lacs     for     which     she   expressed      her\n\ninability.        After    talks,    deal     was   finalized     for    Rs.30\n\nlacs.     Abductor asked her to send money by a train to\n\nJabalpur.        When money was arranged and was carried to\n\nJabalpur by Abhishek Rajput, it was not picked up from the\n\nappointed place instead it was told by the abductor on\n\nphone that he did not take money because she had sent\n\npolice also.       Money was brought back.               Thereafter police\n\ninspector Ritesh Sahu came to her house and alongwith her\n\nhusband went to Jabalpur taking money in the jeep.

On the basis of her information report (Ex.P/4)\n\nwas    recorded.           This      information             was    treated          as     first\n\ninformation         report.

Abhishek Singh (PW-11) also stated that he took\n\nRs.30 lacs to Jabalpur in two bags and on the instructions\n\nof abductor put the same near State Bank ATM opposite\n\nRailway     Platform      No.1.      From   the    evidence    of   these\n\nwitnesses it has been established that deceased had been\n\nabducted     and    the   abductor    had   demanded   Rs.30    lacs   as\n\nransom for his release.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_37\">27.

He\n\nkept Rs.30 lacs arranged by Raghuvir Singh in two bags\n\ncontaining Rs.22 lacs and Rs.8 lacs.              According to him, on\n\nway, when abductor wanted to talk to driver of the jeep,\n\nhe talked to him.         On his instructions, he reached at Teen\n\nPatti square and put both the bags containing money on a\n\nhandcart near the road. When he proceeded ahead, he kept\n\nan    eye   on    the   bags   and   informed   the   events   to   other\n\nmembers of the ATS team.             After some time, a boy (Rahul\n\nRajak) came on a motorcycle and picked up the bags.                    He\n\nfollowed that boy, who went to Blue Moon Hotel and parked\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                            14</span>\n\nhis motorcycle.

Since accused Rahul gave no satisfactory answer about\n\nPankaj,      Ritesh        Sahu    brought      him    to   Narsinghpur      Police\n\nStation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_41\">31.    Learned        counsel      for    the     appellant    Rahul    contended\n\nthat     the      evidence        of     aforesaid      witnesses      about     the\n\nrecovery of seizure of Rs.30 lacs from the possession of\n\naccused Rahul was not reliable because the arrest of Rahul\n\nwas    not     made    then       and    there.        He   placed   reliance     on\n\nSadaram vs. State of M.P.-AIR 1974 SC 2294 and                             Mohanlal\n\nGangaram Gehani vs. State of Maharashtra-AIR 1982 SC 839.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">32.    In case of Sadaram (Supra), accused was though named\n\nin the first information report as an assailant, but was\n\nnot arrested by the police till a day after the occurrence\n\nand there was no acceptable evidence against him of any\n\neyewitness to the occurrence.                     Therefore, the Apex Court\n\nheld that his name was inserted in FIR due to enmity.                             In\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                        15</span>\n\nthe instant case, the situation is different.                       The accused\n\nwas not named in the first information report, but the\n\nransom money was recovered from him in the hotel and the\n\nseizure memo was prepared in the hotel, therefore, even if\n\nthe formal arrest of accused Rahul was made subsequently\n\nwhen ATS team handed over his custody to the investigating\n\nofficer of the case, no infirmity can be held to have been\n\ncommitted.      In case of Mohanlal (Supra), similarly, police\n\nthough came to know the name of assailant, but did not\n\ntake any step to arrest or to cause the arrest of any of\n\nthe   accused.         The     facts    of       instant     case    are     quite\n\ndifferent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">33.   The evidence of Ritesh Sahu (PW-21) stood further\n\ncorroborated from the evidence of Ajab Singh (PW-3), the\n\nmanager    of   Blue    Moon    Hotel,       who    stated    that     a   police\n\ninspector seized register of the hotel vide seizure memo\n\nEx.P/18.        In   this    register       it     was   mentioned     that    on\n\n7.5.2009 at 10.10 am Rahul Lunawat had taken a room.                         Ajab\n\nSingh identified accused Rahul in court as a person who\n\nhad taken the room No.304 in his hotel on rent. He also\n\nstated that Inspector Ritesh Sahu seized Rs.30 lacs in two\n\nbags from Rahul.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">34.   Raghuvir       Singh   (PW-8)     and        Abhishek    Singh       (PW-11)\n\nfurther proved that they had kept cash of Rs.30 lacs for\n\npayment as ransom in two bags in the house of Raghuvir\n\nSingh.     In that regard memorandum (Ex.P/10) was drawn by\n\nInspector Ritesh Sahu. The same cash in bags was taken to\n\nJabalpur and was picked up by accused Rahul and ultimately\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                         16</span>\n\nseized from Rahul. In our opinion, it has been proved\n\nbeyond doubt that the money arranged by Raghuvir Singh for\n\npayment      as    ransom    to   abductor      was      recovered    from    the\n\npossession of accused Rahul.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">35.    The next question is whether the dead body of Pankaj\n\nwas recovered at the instance of accused Rahul.                      According\n\nto Inspector Ritesh Sahu (PW-21), after recovery of money\n\nhe brought accused Rahul and the bags of money to Police\n\nStation, Narsinghpur and handed over money and accused to\n\nSub Inspector Umesh Dubey (PW-22), who was investigating\n\nthe case.          Umesh Dubey in the night of 7.5.2009 at about\n\n9.30 interrogated Rahul whereupon he disclosed that he\n\nthrew       the    dead    body   of   Pankaj       in    Narmada    river     at\n\nBhedaghat and that the Wagon R car MP-20-CA-6184 in which\n\nPankaj had gone to Jabalpur was left by him on Raj Marg.\n\nA disclosure memo (Ex.P/19) was recorded in presence of\n\nDipak       Sahu    (PW-14).      Inspector         Swarnjeet   Singh       Dhami\n\n(PW-23) deposed that on the basis of disclosure made by\n\nRahul he went to Bhedaghat taking Rahul with him and got a\n\nsearch made for the body.               Dead body of Pankaj was found\n\nin    the    river    at    Saraswati        Ghat   (Bhedaghat).        A    Murg\n\nintimation report (ExP/9) in that regard was recorded by\n\nhim.    The dead body was identified by Hemant Yadav (PW-10)\n\nand a memorandum of identification (Ex.P/14) was recorded.\n\nEvidence of Inspector Swarnjeet Singh stood corroborated\n\nby the evidence of Shobh Ram (PW-5) and Premchand (PW-6),\n\nwho, on the requisition of police, took out the body from\n\nNarmada      river    and    witnessed        inquest.

Learned      counsel    for    the    appellant         Rahul    submitted\n\nthat the recovery of dead body of deceased from Saraswati\n\nGhat cannot be held to have been on the information given\n\nby accused Rahul because it was not made in his presence.\n\nIn    this    regard,      evidence   of     Inspector         Swarnjeet      Singh\n\nDhami   (PW-23)       is   significant,          who    deposed      that    on    the\n\nbasis of disclosure (Ex.P/19) made by accused Rahul, he\n\nwent to Bhedaghat taking Rahul with him and got the dead\n\nbody searched.          When the body was found, a Murg (Ex.P/9)\n\nwas recorded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">37.    Even otherwise, the scope of discovery of an article\n\nfrom a river has to be appreciated in a different manner.\n\nIt is common knowledge that a thing thrown in a river may\n\nnot be found at the same place, as it might have travelled\n\nto some other place with the flow of water. The dead body\n\nthrown in the river may not be recovered at the time when\n\nit is being searched and it may appear after some more\n\ntime.    In these circumstances, if the body of deceased was\n\nrecovered      by   other     persons       on    the    disclosure         made    by\n\naccused, it is to be deemed to have been recovered in\n\nconsequence      of     the   information         given    by     accused.

This information was recorded by him in\n\npresence of Rajkumar (PW-17) in memorandum (Ex.P/25).                        In\n\nconsequence       of     that    information,           Ashok   Vishwakarma\n\nproduced the gold chain from his house, which was seized\n\nvide memorandum Ex.P/27.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">46.   According to Inspector Dhami (PW-23), accused Satish\n\nParochi,    on    26.5.2009,       gave      information    about      a   gold\n\nbracelet of deceased, which was recovered in consequence\n\nof his information from a bag kept in his house.                      The said\n\ninformation (Ex.P/26) and recovery/seizure (Ex.P/28) were\n\nrecorded    before       witness       Rajkumar      (PW-17).

On\n\nexamination of the statement of aforesaid witnesses, we\n\nfind their evidence reliable in respect to recoveries of\n\ngold rings, gold chain and bracelet from the possession of\n\naccused/appellants.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_57\">47.   Learned counsel for the appellants vehemently argued\n\nthat it was not established that the articles seized from\n\nthe accused persons belonged to deceased.                  Except Raghuvir\n\nSingh Rajput (PW-8), the father of deceased, and aprover\n\nDolly   Ladiya     (PW-1)       none    else     identified     the     seized\n\narticles    as    the    articles      of    deceased.    The   evidence     of\n\nDolly Ladiya (PW-1) was not reliable since her evidence\n\nhad no corroboration from any prior test identification\n\nevidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">48.   On perusal of the evidence of Dolly Ladiya, we find\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                        21</span>\n\nthat in the court she identified rings, bracelet and gold\n\nchain and stated that these articles were worn by the\n\ndeceased.     She had seen rings in the hand of deceased\n\nwhile he was driving the car.                 In cross-examination, she\n\nadmitted    that    she   had       seen    these        articles    in     police\n\nstation while she was in custody.               Admittedly, she did not\n\nparticipate in any prior test identification parade. She\n\nadmitted that she did not disclose to anybody that she\n\ncould identify the said ornaments of deceased prior to her\n\nstatement in the court. In the above circumstances, we do\n\nnot find it safe to place reliance on the evidence of\n\nDolly    Ladiya     (PW-1)    in      respect       to    identification         of\n\nornaments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">49.   Raghuvir Singh Rajput (PW-8), the father of deceased,\n\nidentified the aforesaid articles being that of his son.\n\nAccording    to    him,   when      Pankaj    left       his    house,    he   was\n\nwearing the said articles.             He identified the rings, gold\n\nchain and bracelet in test identification parade (Ex.P/13)\n\nbecause Pankaj used to wear these articles on his body and\n\nhe used to see.       Evidence of Raghuvir Singh Rajput (PW-8)\n\nfinds corroboration from the test identification parade\n\nconducted    by    Tahsildar     Atul       Singh    (PW-9).         Atul    Singh\n\n(PW-9)     stated    that      on     1.8.2009           he    conducted       test\n\nidentification       parade      of    the     rings,         gold   chain      and\n\nbracelet in meeting hall of Tahsil Office.                      Raghuvir Singh\n\ncorrectly identified these articles.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1733815\" id=\"span_20\">50.   Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the\n\naforesaid articles were recovered/seized in the month of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                     22</span>\n\nMay 2009, but they were put up for test identification\n\nparade on 1.8.2009.        In view of the unexplained delay and\n\nthe fact that the ornaments were of common pattern which\n\nwere commonly available in the market, the evidence of\n\ntest identification done by Tahsildar could not be relied\n\nupon.    He placed reliance on the case of <a href=\"/doc/1733815/\" id=\"a_15\">Bharat vs. Staste\n\nof M.P.</a> (2003) 3 SCC 106.</span>          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1733815\" id=\"span_22\">We are unable to agree with the\n\nsubmission made by the learned counsel for the appellants;\n\nfirstly for the reason that the defence did not seek any\n\nexplanation from the investigating officer for the delay\n\nand the fact that the circumstances in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1733815/\" id=\"a_16\">Bharat</a>\n\n(supra) were      different.      In that case the stolen articles\n\nput     for    identification     were   the   ornaments   of   common\n\npattern like silver ornaments (Toda and Khaghwari) not of\n\nany particular design, but were commonly available in the\n\nmarket and generally worn by village ladies. In that case,\n\nsome portion of paper was also stuck to the recovered\n\nornaments,        which    was     visible     at   the     time     of\n\nidentification.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\">51.   Learned counsel for the appellants pointed out that\n\nthe gold chain, which was recovered from accused Ashok\n\ncontained some white metal also, but this fact was not\n\nstated    by    Raghuvir   Singh    (PW-8).      Merely    because   no\n\ndetails of the design            of chain or other articles were\n\ngiven by this witness, who happened to be the father of\n\ndeceased,       his    evidence      cannot    be    discarded.      He\n\ncategorically stated that these articles were identified\n\nby him because deceased used to wear these articles.                 It\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                        23</span>\n\nis true that in his police statement (Ex.D/1) he did not\n\nsay that he would identify the bracelet, chain and rings\n\nof deceased, but on perusal of Ex.D/1 we find that he\n\ndisclosed that after recovery of the body he came to know\n\nthat the aforesaid articles were removed from the body of\n\nhis son.     It is also significant to note that initially it\n\nwas suspected to be a case of abduction for ransom and not\n\nof robbery of the articles belonging to deceased. In the\n\nfact situation of the instant case, it is quite natural\n\nfor Raghuvir Singh (PW-8) to have identified the articles\n\nbelonging to his son.            We hold that the finding recorded\n\nby the trial court that the articles recovered from the\n\npossession of accused/appellants belonged to and were in\n\npossession of the deceased is just and proper.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"252531\" id=\"span_24\">52.

She made improvements in\n\nstating that accused Rahul wanted to obtain Rs.80 lacs\n\nfrom Pankaj and that she had left Bhedaghat in an auto\n\ninstead     on     motorcycle         with       accused     Ashok         Vishwakarma.\n\nPlacing reliance on the decisions rendered by Apex Court\n\nin    AIR    1963       SC    599-Bhiva          Doulu   Patil        vs.    State         of\n\nMaharashtra,        AIR        1968        SC     594-Lt.

Therefore, though the conviction of an\n\naccused on the testimony of accomplice cannot be said to\n\nbe illegal yet the courts will, as a matter of practice,\n\nnot   accept      the   evidence     of    such   a    witness    without\n\ncorroboration in material particular.

In case of Lt. Commander Pascal\n\n(supra)        the Apex Court, with reference to                           <a href=\"/doc/132714206/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 8(2)</a>\n\nof the Criminal Law (Amendment) Act, observed that there\n\nwas nothing in the language of that section to show that\n\nthe special judge must be moved by the prosecution. He may\n\nconsider an offer by an accused.                         Before the special judge\n\nacts to tender pardon, he must, of course, know the nature\n\nof the evidence the person seeking conditional pardon is\n\nlikely    to    give,        the    nature         of    his     complicity      and   the\n\ndegree of his culpability in relation to the offence and\n\nin    relation    to       the     co-accused.              To    determine      whether\n\naccused&#x27;s testimony as an approver is likely to advance\n\nthe    interest       of     justice,         the       special       judge   must     have\n\nmaterial       before      him     to    show       that       what    nature    of    that\n\ntestimony will be.                     Apex Court further observed that\n\nordinarily       it     is    for       the    prosecution            to   ask   that     a\n\nparticular accused may be tendered pardon, but even where\n\nthe accused directly applies to the special judge, he must\n\nfirst refer the request to the prosecuting agency.                                    Since\n\nthe power which judge exercises is not of his own behalf,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                          30</span>\n\nbut on behalf of prosecuting agency, it must, therefore,\n\nbe    exercised     only     when       the   prosecution          joins     in   the\n\nrequest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">65.   From   the      order        sheet      of   the       trial     court      i.e.\n\n20.11.2009 it appears that public prosecutor expressed no\n\nobjection on the application filed by accused Dolly Ladiya\n\nand the learned trial judge after considering it tendered\n\nconditional pardon to her.               It is also significant to note\n\nthat this pardon was granted at the stage when charges had\n\nalready been framed against accused Dolly Ladiya.                                  The\n\nprovisions of sub-section (4) (a) of <a href=\"/doc/122405/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 306</a> Cr.P.C.\n\nare   attracted      only     at    a    stage      when     the     case    is   not\n\ncommitted to the court of session.                      After commitment, the\n\npardon has to be granted by the trial court subject to the\n\nconditions specified in sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/122405/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 306</a>\n\nCr.P.C., i.e. approver&#x27;s making full and true disclosure\n\nof the whole of the circumstances within his knowledge\n\nrelating     to     the     offence        and     to    every       other     person\n\nconcerned,        whether     as     principal          or   abettor,        in    the\n\ncommission thereof.

In the light of above proposition of law, we find\n\nthat trial judge committed no error in tendering pardon to\n\napprover Dolly Ladiya.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">67.   Dolly Ladiya (PW-1) stated that accused Rahul Rajak\n\nintroduced her to Satish Parochi and Ashok Vishwakarma.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                             31</span>\n\nHe also introduced her to deceased.                           On 5.5.2009, Rahul\n\nRajak asked her to bring deceased to Bhedaghat.                               When she\n\nasked about the purpose, he told to her that he will\n\nobtain Rs.80 lacs from his parents out of which he will\n\ngive    Rs.    10    lacs     to     her.           She   called        deceased,    and\n\nalongwith him went to New Bhedaghat in his Wagon R.                                  At\n\nNew Bhedaghat, a lonely place, she found all the three\n\naccused persons present in advance. They called deceased\n\nand asked her to go back. According to her, accused Rahul\n\nhad given her a mobile with sim to talk with deceased.\n\nWhen she was asked to go back, the sim of this mobile was\n\ntaken out from the mobile by accused Ashok.                             Later on, she\n\ncame to know from newspaper that deceased was murdered at\n\nthe place where she had left him.                           On 8.5.2009, she was\n\narrested by the police.                On interrogation by the police,\n\nshe disclosed that the mobile set given by Rahul was with\n\nher.      In   this        regard,    a     disclosure        memo       (Ex.P/1)   was\n\nrecorded and the said mobile was seized from her.                                   This\n\nwitness though identified the ornaments/articles recovered\n\nfrom the possession of accused persons in the court, but\n\nwe, for the reasons given in para 48 of this judgment,\n\nhave already held this part of her evidence unworthy of\n\nreliance.        Learned counsel for the appellants submitted\n\nthat it would not be safe to rely on rest of her evidence\n\nfirstly       for    the     reason        that       there       was    no   previous\n\nstatement of this approver witness from which her veracity\n\ncould   have        been    tested;       at     least      her    statement     under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_36\">Section    164</a>      Cr.P.C.        ought       to    have    been       recorded,    and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                          32</span>\n\nsecondly that her evidence suffered with omissions and\n\ncontradictions        on     material         particulars       of     the   case.\n\nThough she stated that she went back home from Bhedaghat\n\nby auto, but this fact was found missing in her statement\n\n(Ex.P/1)    recorded        by    police      by    way   of   disclosure        memo\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act.                     Similarly, the fact\n\nthat accused Rahul Rajak told to her that he will obtain\n\nRs.80    lacs    from      the    parents      of   deceased     was      also    not\n\nmentioned       by   her    in    the   said       statement.        We    are    not\n\nimpressed by the submission made by the learned counsel\n\nfor the appellants.              This witness was tendered pardon at\n\nthe stage when charges had already been framed before the\n\nsessions court.         There was no occasion for having recorded\n\nher statement under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C. by the police.                            It\n\nwas also not possible to have recorded her statement under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 164</a> Cr.P.C., since a confession or statement could\n\nbe recorded by a Magistrate in the course of investigation\n\nor at any time afterwards before the commencement of the\n\nenquiry or trial.                We, however, find substance in the\n\nsubmission made by the learned counsel for the appellants\n\nthat the statement of disclosure made by approver Dolly\n\nLadiya   under       <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_40\">Section      27</a>    of    the   Evidence     Act      could   be\n\ntreated as a previous statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 161</a>\n\nCr.P.C., and that the learned trial judge committed error\n\nin holding that she could not be confronted with the said\n\nstatement (Ex.P/1) because it was recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_42\">Section\n\n27</a> of the Evidence Act.                 In Ex.P/1, Dolly Ladiya (PW-1)\n\nstated that on 5.5.2009 she went back from Bhedaghat to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                            33</span>\n\nher    home       with    Ashok     Vishwakarma           on     his     motorcycle.\n\nInspector         Swarnjeet        Singh        Dhami     (PW-23)        proved       the\n\nstatement of Dolly Ladiya (Ex.P/1) recorded under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_43\">Section\n\n27</a> of the Evidence Act.                 He also stated that he verified\n\nthe fact that accused Ashok Vishwakarma had taken Dolly to\n\nher    house       from    Bhedaghat.           Learned        counsel       of    Ashok\n\nVishwakarma submitted that by the fact that accused Ashok\n\nVishwakarma        went     back     from        Bhedaghat       alongwith         Dolly\n\nLadiya       it   became      doubtful          that     he     was    involved       in\n\ncommission of murder of deceased.                       We find no substance in\n\nthe submission because it has not been stated by Dolly\n\nLadiya (PW-1) that after reaching Bhedaghat she went back\n\nwith Ashok Vishwakarma immediately.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">68.    It is true that Dolly Ladiya (PW-1) in Ex.P/1 did not\n\nsay that accused Rahul told to her about obtaining Rs.80\n\nlacs from the parents of deceased, but, in our opinion,\n\nthis    omission         cannot    be     held     to     render       her    evidence\n\nunreliable because the purpose for which this statement\n\nwas recorded was the disclosure of a mobile set in her\n\npossession.         It could not be expected to have contained\n\nthe whole of the prosecution story.                            Further, the fact\n\nthat motive of accused Rahul was to obtain ransom from the\n\nparents of deceased finds corroboration from the fact that\n\nhe    made    a    demand     of    Rs.80        lacs     initially          but   later\n\nobtained Rs.30 lacs on the pretext of ransom from them.\n\nFrom the evidence of Dolly Ladiya, it is revealed that\n\naccused      Rahul       Rajak     used    her     as     a    bait     for       calling\n\ndeceased to Bhedaghat.              All the three accused persons and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                          34</span>\n\nthe deceased were residents of Narsinghpur, but they did\n\nnot themselves call deceased to Bhedaghat.                         This clearly\n\nindicated their connivance and intention to abduct the\n\ndeceased.       Though Dolly Ladiya stated that her relations\n\nwith deceased were only professional, but the manner in\n\nwhich she called him and persuaded him to go to Bhedaghat\n\nwhere     he    ultimately      was      murdered       indicated        that       her\n\nrelations      with    deceased     were       some     what    more    than    mere\n\nprofessional.         From    the   evidence      of    Dolly     Ladiya       it    is\n\nclearly established that the deceased was last seen alive\n\nwith all the three accused persons.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_79\">69.   Learned counsel for the appellants submitted that the\n\ntrial court committed error in holding that the evidence\n\nof    Dolly     Ladiya       indicated        conspiracy       between     accused\n\npersons    to    commit       murder     and     obtain        ransom    from       his\n\nparents.       There is seldom direct evidence of conspiracy.\n\nMostly the conspiracies are proved by the circumstantial\n\nevidence.       The existence of conspiracy and its objective\n\nhave to be inferred from the circumstances and the conduct\n\nof accused persons.            The incriminating circumstances must\n\nform a chain of events from which a conclusion about the\n\nguilt of the accused could be drawn (Yogesh                              @ Sachin\n\nJagdish Joshi vs. State of Maharashtra-AIR 2008 SC 2991) .\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">70.   Learned counsel for the appellants reiterated that\n\nthe   evidence     of    Approver      cannot      be    accepted       unless       it\n\nfinds corroboration on material particulars.                             The Apex\n\nCourt in case of Sitaram                  Sao @ Mungeri vs. State of\n\nJharkhand-AIR 2008 SC 391 observed that &quot;The rule is that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                        35</span>\n\nthe necessity of corroboration is a matter of prudence\n\nexcept     when    it     is     subject      to     dispense       with        such\n\ncorroboration.       Although         <a href=\"/doc/731516/\" id=\"a_44\">S.    114</a>     illustration       (b)       of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_45\">Evidence Act</a> provides that the court may presume that the\n\nevidence of an accomplice was unworthy of credit unless\n\ncorroborated, &#x27;may&#x27; is not &#x27;must&#x27; and no decision of Court\n\ncan make it must. ...................... As regards nature\n\nof corroborative evidence that is necessary, it is not\n\nnecessary that there should be independent confirmation of\n\nevery     material       circumstance        in     the     sense     that      the\n\nindependent witness in the case, apart from the testimony\n\nof the complainant or the accomplice, should in itself be\n\nsufficient to sustain conviction.                  All that is required is\n\nthat there must be some additional evidence rendering it\n\nprobable that the story of the accomplice is true and that\n\nit is reasonably safe to act upon it.                        The independent\n\nevidence must not only make it safe to believe that the\n\ncrime    was    committed       but   must    in     some     way   reasonably\n\nconnect    or     tend    to    connect      the     accused    with       it     by\n\nconfirming in some material particular the testimony of\n\nthe accomplice or complainant that the accused committed\n\nthe crime. The corroboration must come from independent\n\nsources     and    thus        ordinarily     the         testimony    of       one\n\naccomplice would not be sufficient to corroborate that of\n\nanother. The corroboration need not be direct evidence\n\nthat the accused committed the crime.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">71.   On a careful examination of the evidence of Dolly\n\nLadiya (PW-1) in the light of above propositions we find\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                        36</span>\n\nthat her evidence with respect to the fact that accused\n\nRahul wanted to obtain money from the parents of deceased\n\nstands corroborated from the evidence of Inspector of ATS\n\nRitesh Sahu (PW-21), Raghuvir Singh (PW-8) and Murad Ali\n\n(PW-16) about the recovery of Rs.30 lacs delivered to him\n\nby way of Ransom.          The fact that deceased was last seen by\n\nher   together      with    accused       persons        at    Bhedaghat       finds\n\ncorroboration       from     the     fact    that       his     dead    body      was\n\nrecovered    from       Bhedaghat     on     the       information       given     by\n\naccused     Rahul    Rajak     and     further         from     the     fact     that\n\nornaments/articles          which     were        in     the     possession        of\n\ndeceased were recovered from the possession of accused\n\npersons.

From the evidence on record, following circumstances\n\nstand proved beyond reasonable doubt:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       (1)Accused        Rahul     gave     mobile       with     sim    to     Dolly\n            Ladiya (PW-1) to keep contact with deceased.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">       (2)On      the    instructions        of        accused    Rahul        Rajak,\n            Dolly Ladiya called the deceased and took him to\n            Bhedaghat.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       (3)Though accused persons were known to deceased\n            and   were       residents       of    Narsinghpur          where     the\n            deceased       resided,    yet    they       did     not    themselves\n            call deceased to join them at Bhedaghat.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">       (4)All the three accused persons were present at\n            Bhedaghat when Dolly Ladiya took deceased there.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       (5)Accused Ashok Vishwakarma took back sim of the\n            mobile of Dolly Ladiya at Bhedaghat which was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                       37</span>\n\n           used by her for calling deceased.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">        (6)Deceased, who was left in the company of accused\n           persons, was thereafter never seen alive.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">        (7)Dead body of deceased was discovered from river\n           at Bhedaghat on the information given by accused\n           Rahul Rajak.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">        (8)Gold     rings,   gold      chain     and    the    bracelet     of\n           deceased were recovered from the possession of\n           accused persons.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">        (9)A demand of ransom was made from the parents of\n           deceased.

In our opinion, on the basis of above circumstances,\n\nlearned trial judge committed no error in holding that the\n\nchain     of     circumstances        proved     by     the        prosecution\n\nunerringly indicated that the accused/appellants under a\n\nconspiracy by deceitful means induced deceased to go to\n\nBhedaghat and caused his death in order to compel his\n\nparents to pay ransom and further that they dishonestly\n\nmisappropriated the property possessed by deceased at the\n\ntime of his death and threw his body in river Narmada for\n\ncausing   disappearance      of      the   evidence     of    offence.      We\n\naccordingly      affirm   the     conviction      of    appellants       Rahul\n\nRajak, Ashok Vishwakarma and Satish Parochi under <a href=\"/doc/35784/\" id=\"a_46\">Sections\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                        38</span></a>\n\n364-A/<a href=\"/doc/94346/\" id=\"a_47\">34</a>, 302 r/w <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 120-B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/386021/\" id=\"a_49\">201</a> and <a href=\"/doc/341288/\" id=\"a_50\">404</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_51\">34</a> of the\n\nIndian Penal Code.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_84\">74.   As     far    as     the   question        of   death     sentence     to\n\nappellants         is    concerned,         learned      counsel    for      the\n\nappellants submitted that in the facts and circumstances\n\nof the case it cannot be held to be a rarest of rare case\n\ncalling for death penalty.             Per contra,learned counsel for\n\nthe State and also the learned counsel for the complainant\n\nsubmitted that the offence committed by accused is so mean\n\nand heinous that it falls clearly in the ambit of a rarest\n\nof rare case justifying capital punishment.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"733548\" id=\"span_46\">75.   It is true that the accused kidnapped deceased for\n\nextracting ransom from his parents in a preplanned manner\n\nand even after deceased was murdered, accused Rahul Rajak\n\nmade them to believe that deceased was alive and would be\n\nreleased if they pay ransom, but, in our opinion in the\n\nfacts and circumstances of the case it cannot be held to\n\nbe a rarest of rare case. No doubt the act of accused\n\npersons is inhumane, yet there was nothing particularly\n\nbrutal, grotesque or dastardly in manner of its execution.\n\nFor judging whether a case falls in the category of &#x27;the\n\nrarest of rare cases&#x27;, the Apex Court in case of <a href=\"/doc/733548/\" id=\"a_52\">Wakkar\n\nvs. State of U.P.</a> - (2011) 3 SCC 306 observed that the\n\ndecision     of    the    High   Court      to   award   life   imprisonment\n\nalone      and    not    the   death   sentence       was   correct     as    it\n\nconsidered        &quot;For    awarding     death     sentence:      There   is   no\n\ndirect evidence as to the manner in which the gruesome\n\nmurder has taken place.           It is not possible to discern and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                    39</span>\n\narrive at any definite conclusion as to the role played by\n\neach of the accused in the commission of dastardly crime.\n\nNo doubt they committed the crime in cold blood, but did\n\nit    quite    stealthily.   The    entire    case    rests    on   the\n\ncircumstantial evidence. The High Court having taken all\n\nrelevant factors rightly came to the conclusion that the\n\ncase is not the one which falls in the category of &#x27;the\n\nrarest of rare cases&#x27;.        In the instant case, the age of\n\ntwo accused persons viz. Rahul Rajak and Satish Parochi is\n\nabout 25, 28 years.       Nothing has been brought on record to\n\nindicate the probability that the accused would commit\n\ncriminal acts of violence as would constitute a continuous\n\nthreat to society and that there is no probability that\n\nthey cannot be reformed and rehabilitated.             It is apparent\n\nthat accused persons in this materialistic society could\n\nnot    control    their   greed    for   money   by    indulging     in\n\nnefarious activities. In the facts and circumstances of\n\nthe case and particularly in view of the above mitigating\n\ncircumstances we find that the case is not one which falls\n\nin the category of &#x27;the rarest of rare cases&#x27; calling for\n\ndeath penalty.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_86\">76.
