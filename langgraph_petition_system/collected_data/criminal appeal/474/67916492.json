The abductee Siyaram (PW-6) did not support the story of the\nprosecution and was declared hostile. Infact PW-6 went to the extent\nof disclosing that the appellant was not one of the abductors /\naccused. The other abductee Ramsiya (PW-7) however supported\nthe prosecution story. In his testimony PW-7 has stated that he had\nbeen abducted and confined and kept in the ravines and was\nreleased only after his father paid the ransom of Rs. 1,50,000/-. As\nregards the allegation of demand and payment of ransom, the father\nof PW-7 has not been examined.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">6.1.   The other witness in shape of PW-3 Ratan Singh has also\nturned hostile and has denied even knowing or having seen the\nappellant. Shri Nath (PW-2), who is brother of the abductee Siyaram\nhas averred that Karu (son of Ramsiya one of the abductee) came to\nhim in search of Ramsiya when he came to know of the incident. The\nsaid Karu, who happens to be the son of one of the abductee\nRamsiya has not been examined. Radha Mohan Sharma (PW-1) is\nthe complainant and son of one of the abductee Ramsiya has testified\nthat he came to know that some persons have been abducted from\nvillage Surajpur and that Ramsiya has also been abducted.\nWhereafter PW-1 reported the matter to the police and informed the\npolice of the spot where the abduction took place and signed on the\nspot map prepared by the police. PW-7 is the abductee Ramsiya who\ntestifies that he was kidnapped by a gang comprising of several\npersons including the appellant. PW-7 further disclosed that he was\nreleased from captivity only after payment of ransom of Rs. 1,50,000/-\nwas made. As regards factum of abduction and being confined for\nconsiderable period of time in the ravines, the said PW-7 could not be\ndiscredited by the defence in the cross-examination and stood by his\nversion and supported the prosecution story. However, as far as\nacceptance of ransom is concerned, this witness in para 9 of his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                    5</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                 CRA.625/2015 &amp; CRA.626/2015</span>\n\ndeposition has stated that despite he having disclosed to the police\nabout the fact of being released after payment of ransom of Rs.\n1,50,000/- by his father, this revelation is not contained in his\nstatement<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_18\"> u/s 161</a> C.P.C. Thus to the extent of factum of demand,\npayment and receipt of ransom money there appears to be\nimprovement over his earlier statement recorded u/s 161 by PW-7.\nAS REGARDS CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 626/2015\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">7.    Abductee Mukesh (PW-2), abductee Ramvilas (PW-6) and\nabductee Jaswant (PW-7) deposed before the court on 14.07.2003,\n18.08.2003 and 18.08.2003 respectively. Out of the said three\nabductees only one i.e. Jaswant (PW-7) disclosed that the appellant\nwas one of the persons in the gang which abducted and kidnapped\nthe said abductees in the night of 27.02.1999. However, this PW-7\nwas declared hostile to the prosecution as he categorically denied\nhaving seen the other co-accused. The other two abductees Mukesh\n(PW-2) and Ramvilas (PW-6) did not name the appellant as one of\nthe abductors /kidnappers infact testimony of PW-2 is to the effect\nthat he has not named any of the accused including the appellant\nexcept Bhoore Singh. While the other abductee Ramvilas (PW-6) has\ninfact categorically denied that appellant was one of the abductors.\n7.1   Ramlal (PW-1), Narsingh (PW-3) , Ramveer (PW-4), Avdhesh\n(PW-8) who are eyewitnesses have not implicated the appellant and\nhave also not supported the story of the prosecution as such have\nbeen declared as hostile.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">7.2   Pertinently, the statements of number of prosecution witnesses\nincluding Narsingh, Jaswant, Mukesh, Ramvilas and Ramlal were\nagain recorded as PW-2, PW-3, PW-4, PW-5 and PW-6 respectively\nbefore the trial court and all of these witnesses categorically denied\nhaving seen the appellant on the fateful night among the kidnappers /\nabductors.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">7.3    Thus, entire case of the prosecution in regard to the appellant\nin criminal appeal No. 626/2015 hinges upon the testimony of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                   6</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                 CRA.625/2015 &amp; CRA.626/2015</span>\n\nabductee Jaswant (PW-7), who has specifically named the appellant\nas one of the abductors. Thus the court is required to analyze the\ndeposition of this witness and none others. Jaswant (PW-7), has by\nnaming the appellant proved the fact of having been abducted along\nwith Mukesh and Ramvilas. Thus factum of appellant having indulged\nin kidnapping / abduction of abductees appears of have been\nestablished by the deposition of PW-7 which has remained\nunimpeached in the cross-examination. In the testimony of Jaswant\n(PW-7) there is no disclosure of the said PW having been subjected\nto fear of death or injury or in regard to demand, payment and receipt\nof the amount of ransom. Thus, the only ingredient of &quot;abduction for\nbeing confined in the ravines&quot; has been established qua the\nappellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">8.    The trial court held the charge of kidnapping / abduction for\nransom to be proved<a href=\"/doc/1374258/\" id=\"a_19\"> u/s 364A</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_20\">34</a> IPC interalia recording the finding in\npara 7 of the impugned judgment that for establishing the offence\npunishable u/s 364A, it is not necessary to establish that the\nkidnapping and confinement was made only for extraction of ransom\nmoney but the requirement of the section is satisfied if it is proved\nthat abductee was subjected to threat of death or hurt or put to\nreasonable apprehension that abductee may put to death or hurt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">9.    Learned counsel for the appellant after taking us through the\nmaterial available on record in shape of oral and documentary\nevidence of substantive and corroborative nature and the finding\nrecorded by the learned trial Judge, does not dispute that there is\nsufficient evidence on record to establish that abductees were\nabducted and were confined. However, learned counsel for the\nappellant submits that there is no further evidence to establish that\nabductees were ever subjected to any threat of death or hurt or any\nreasonable apprehension of death or hurt and also that there is no\nevidence to substantiate the allegation of demand, payment and\nreceipt of ransom amount.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                    7</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                  CRA.625/2015 &amp; CRA.626/2015</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">10.   Before analyzing the evidence available on record on the anvil\nof the law in the field, it would be appropriate to reproduce Section\n364(A) and <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_21\">Sec. 365</a> IPC, The latter being a lesser offence:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      &quot;364A.

To attract the provisions of Sectoin 364-A what is required\n      to be proved is: (1) that the accused kidnapped or abducted\n      the person; (2) kept him under detention after such kidnapping\n      and abduction; and (3) that the kidnapping or abduction was\n      for ransom.....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">            To pay a ransom, as stated in the above referred\n      Section, in the ordinary sense means to pay the price or\n      demand for ransom.

To attract the provisions of Section 364 A what is\n      required to be proved is (1) that the accused kidnapped or\n      abducted the person; and (2) kept him under detention after\n      such kidnapping and abduction; and (3) that the kidnapping or\n      abduction was for ransom. Strong reliance was placed on a\n      decision of the Delhi High Court in <a href=\"/doc/107388289/\" id=\"a_28\">Netra Pal Vs. The State\n      (NCT of Delhi</a>) (2001 Crl.

From the above analysis, it is evident that if the abduction /\nkidnapping and keeping in detention after kidnapping / abduction is\nfor ransom then the factum of ransom having been demanded, paid\nand accepted is required to be established. In the instant case none\nof the prosecution witnesses have made any statement as to the\nplace, time and mode of making of demand of ransom money,\npayment and receipt of the same by the appellant. Omnibus\nallegation has been made by the abductee Ramsiya (PW-7) that he\nwas released after ransom money was paid by his father. Father of\nRamsiya, who is said to be the ransom giver, has not been subjected\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                    9</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                  CRA.625/2015 &amp; CRA.626/2015</span>\n\nto examination by the prosecution. There is further no evidence from\nthe statement of any of the abductees or other prosecution witnesses\nthat at any point of time during the period confinement in the ravines\nthey were put to any threat of death or hurt or were put to reasonable\napprehension that death or hurt would be caused. In the absence of\nabove said two important factors of threat or death / hurt to the\nabductees and the ransom money having been demanded, paid and\nreceived, the offence of kidnapping / abduction for ransom u/s 364A\nin the considered opinion of this Court is not made out.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">14.   Learned counsel for the State has made a valiant attempt by\nraising an argument that offence punishable<a href=\"/doc/1374258/\" id=\"a_29\"> u/s 364A</a> IPC can be\nmade out even in the absence of proof of demand, payment and\nreceipt of ransom money. Learned counsel for the State has taken us\nthrough the expressions employed in Section 364 (A) especially &quot;to\ndo or abstain from doing any act&quot; to contend that since the appellant\nprevented the abductees from doing any act by curtailing their\nfreedom by confining them in the ravines for the considerable period\nof time, the offence<a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_30\"> u/s 364 (A)</a> IPC is made out.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">15.   At first blush, the argument of learned counsel for the State\nappears to be impressive, however, in actuality deserves out right\nrejection as it arises from misreading of Section 364 (A). The\nexpression &quot;to do or abstain from doing any act&quot; is relatable not to the\nabductee but to the person from whom the ransom is sought in lieu of\nrelease of the abductee.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">16.   It may not be out of place to mention here that similar view has\nbeen taken by the Coordinate Bench of this Court by relying upon the\nabove said decision of the Apex Court in the case of Akram Khan\nand Malleshi (supra) in judgment dated 6th September, 2013 in\nCriminal Appeals No. 168/2004 &amp; 255/2004.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">17.   The result of the above analysis and discussion is that in the\nabsence of proof of abductees being subjected to threat or\nreasonable apprehension of threat of death or hurt and there being\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                   10</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                  CRA.625/2015 &amp; CRA.626/2015</span>\n\ntotal absence of evidence to support the other factum of demand,\npayment and receipt of ransom money, this Court has no hesitation to\nhold that the appellant cannot be held guilty for the offence\npunishable<a href=\"/doc/1374258/\" id=\"a_31\"> u/s 364A</a> IPC. However, since the prosecution is\nsuccessful in proving that the abductees were abducted by a gang of\npersons including the appellant and the abductees were secretly and\nwrongfully confined for a considerable period of time, essential\ningredients of <a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 365</a> IPC appear to be made out and the\nappellant deserves to be convicted for an offence punishable<a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_33\"> u/s 365</a>\nIPC for both the offences arising out of Crime No. 12/1999 and\n13/1999.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">18.   Accordingly, the Criminal Appeals No. 625/2015 and 626/2015\nare disposed of in the following manner :-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">      (i)     The conviction and sentence of the appellant<a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_34\"> u/s 364 (A)</a>\n      / <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_35\">34</a> IPC rendered by the trial court in S.T. No. 38/2001 as well\n      as S.T. No. 39/2001 is set aside.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      (ii)    However, the appellant is held guilty of the offence\n      punishable<a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_36\"> u/s 365</a> IPC and is sentenced to suffer seven (7)\n      years of R.I. in Criminal Appeal No. 625/2015 along with fine of\n      Rs.5,000/- , in default of which to suffer further R.I. of Six (6)\n      months. The amount of fine of Rs. 5000/- be adjusted against\n      any amount already paid.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      (iii)   The appellant is also held guilty of the offence\n      punishable<a href=\"/doc/886598/\" id=\"a_37\"> u/s 365</a> IPC and is sentenced to suffer seven (7)\n      years of R.I. in Criminal Appeal No. 626/2015 along with fine of\n      Rs.5,000/- , in default of which to suffer further R.I. of Six (6)\n      months. The amount of fine of Rs. 5000/- be adjusted against\n      any amount already paid.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">      (iv)    If the appellant has suffered the modified sentence in\n      both the appeals he be released forthwith with his bail bonds\n      stand discharged but in case appellant has not yet suffered the\n      reduced / modified sentences in both the appeals then he shall\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                  11</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                 CRA.625/2015 &amp; CRA.626/2015</span>\n\n             surrender forthwith failing which the trial court is directed to\n             apprehend him.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<pre id=\"pre_3\">          (Sheel Nagu)                                   (S.A.
