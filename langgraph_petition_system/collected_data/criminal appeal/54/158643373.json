As per the prosecution, the appellants had\n                  a motive to cause the occurrence and, therefore, they came\n                  with common object. The accused were equipped with the\n                  weapons thus not only case of unlawful assembly was\n                  proved but their participation with common object also gets\n                  proved in reference to the incident took place four days ago\n                  when complainant party attacked on the accused party.

In view of the above, there was a motive with\n                  the accused to cause occurrence. Once motive was there,\n                  common object to cause occurrence can also be inferred,\n                  however, conviction cannot be based on inferences but facts\n                  proved by evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">                                     …            …           …\n\n                  The injured and deceased did not receive injury by sharp\n                  edged weapon but it all depends whether Gandasi was sharp\n                  enough to cause such an injury.

The said\n                  witness has supported the statement of Rajendra S/o\n                  Kashi/Dharam Singh. It is also a fact that no weapon has\n                  been recovered from him and, initially, when the FIR was\n                  lodged, name of only one Rajendra was given for head\n                  injury. It was subsequently named by the witness as\n                  Rajendra Singh @ Tanti. In view of the above, we find a\n                  case in favour of Rajendra S/o Kashi/Dharam Singh. It is\n                  not only by accepting his plea of alibi but taking into\n                  consideration the evidence to corroborate it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">                  So far as other accused are concerned, since we have not\n                  accepted the case of the prosecution for conviction with the\n                  aid of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 149</a> IPC and as specific allegation for causing\n                  injury with the assignment of weapon has not been made, we\n                  find a case in their favour also.

In Masalti5 one Laxmi\n                  Prasad and his armed companions had proceeded to the\n                  house of one Gayadin. On the instigation of Laxmi Prasad,\n                  the assailants broke open the doors of the house of Gayadin,\n                  killed four persons including Gayadin and dragged their\n                  bodies out of the house whereafter one more person was\n                  killed. These five dead bodies were then taken to the field\n                  and set on fire. Out of thirty-five accused who were\n                  convicted, ten accused were given death sentence. The High\n                  Court confirmed their sentence of death and out of the\n                  remaining accused, seven were given benefit of doubt.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">                  Insofar as the accused who were convicted with the aid of\n                  Section 149, the High Court adopted a test and held that\n                  unless at least four witnesses had shown to have given a\n                  consistent account against any of the appellants, the case\n                  against them could not be said to have been proved. The\n                  decision discloses that except Laxmi Prasad, none of the\n                  assailants was assigned any particular part. The evidence as\n                  regards other accused was that they were part of unlawful\n                  assembly which is evident from the following observations\n                  of this Court: (Masalti case5, AIR p. 207, para 7)\n\n                       “7. … It also considered another feature which\n                       characterised the evidence of all the witnesses and\n                       that was that they gave their account of the\n                       incident substantially in similar terms and did not\n                       assign particular parts in respect of overt acts to\n                       any of the assailants except Laxmi Prasad,\n                       Accused 1.”\n\n                  The observations of this Court further show that though\n                  testimony of a single witness would be enough to convict an\n                  accused person, in a case involving large number of accused,\n                  where the witnesses depose to the fact that certain persons\n                  were members of unlawful assembly which had committed\n                  the offences in question, a test so adopted by the High Court\n                  was found to be safe. It was observed that though every\n                  member of the unlawful assembly would be liable for the\n                  offence committed by anyone actuated by and entertaining\n\fCriminal Appeal No…………………of 2021 etc. [arising out of SLP(Crl.)No. 8676 of 2019 etc.)\nState of Rajasthan etc. vs. Bablu @ Om Prakash etc.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                                                        30</span>\n                  common object of the unlawful assembly, in the absence of\n                  any overt act or specific allegation, it was possible to adopt\n                  such test.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">                                          … … …\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">                  24. The liability of those members of the unlawful assembly\n                  who actually committed the offence would depend upon the\n                  nature and acceptability of the evidence on record. The\n                  difficulty may however arise, while considering the liability\n                  and extent of culpability of those who may not have actually\n                  committed the offence but were members of that assembly.\n                  What binds them and makes them vicariously liable is the\n                  common object in prosecution of which the offence was\n                  committed by other members of the unlawful assembly.\n                  Existence of common object can be ascertained from the\n                  attending facts and circumstances. For example, if more than\n                  five persons storm into the house of the victim where only\n                  few of them are armed while the others are not and the armed\n                  persons open an assault, even unarmed persons are\n                  vicariously liable for the acts committed by those armed\n                  persons. In such a situation it may not be difficult to ascertain\n                  the existence of common object as all the persons had\n                  stormed into the house of the victim and it could be assessed\n                  with certainty that all were guided by the common object,\n                  making every one of them liable. Thus when the persons\n                  forming the assembly are shown to be having same interest\n                  in pursuance of which some of them come armed, while\n                  others may not be so armed, such unarmed persons if they\n                  share the same common object, are liable for the acts\n                  committed by the armed persons. But in a situation where\n                  assault is opened by a mob of fairly large number of people,\n                  it may at times be difficult to ascertain whether those who\n                  had not committed any overt act were guided by the common\n                  object. There can be room for entertaining a doubt whether\n                  those persons who are not attributed of having done any\n                  specific overt act, were innocent bystanders or were actually\n                  members of the unlawful assembly. It is for this reason that\n                  in Masalti5 this Court was cautious and cognizant that no\n                  particular part in respect of an overt act was assigned to any\n                  of the assailants except Laxmi Prasad. It is in this backdrop\n                  and in order to consider\n\fCriminal Appeal No…………………of 2021 etc. [arising out of SLP(Crl.)No. 8676 of 2019 etc.)\nState of Rajasthan etc. vs. Bablu @ Om Prakash etc.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                                                                        31</span>\n\n                       “whether the assembly consisted of some persons\n                       who were merely passive witnesses and had joined\n                       the assembly as a matter of idle curiosity without\n                       intending to entertain the common object of the\n                       assembly”, (AIR p. 211, para 17)\n\n                  this Court at SCR pp. 148-49 in Masalti5 observed that his\n                  participation as a member of the unlawful assembly ought to\n                  be spoken by more than one witness in order to lend\n                  corroboration. The test so adopted in Masalti5 was only to\n                  determine liability of those accused against whom there was\n                  no clear allegation of having committed any overt act but\n                  what was alleged against them was about their presence as\n                  members of the unlawful assembly. The test so adopted was\n                  not to apply to cases where specific allegations and overt acts\n                  constituting the offence are alleged or ascribed to certain\n                  named assailants. If such test is to be adopted even where\n                  there are specific allegations and overt acts attributed to\n                  certain named assailants, it would directly run counter to the\n                  well-known maxim that “evidence has to be weighed and not\n                  counted” as statutorily recognised in <a href=\"/doc/838383/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 134</a> of the\n                  Evidence Act.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">      20.

In the face of such clear, consistent and cogent evidence on record, the\n\n      High Court was not justified in proceeding on the basis that the eyewitnesses\n\n      had not named other accused in specific terms or entertaining any doubt and\n\n      then recording order of acquittal.           The approach of the High Court was\n\n      completely against the settled principles of law and no valid reasons were given\n\n      by the High Court as to why the evidence of all the eyewitnesses could not be\n\n      relied upon in so far as the role played by the acquitted accused was concerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">      We find the order of acquittal recorded by the High Court to be completely\n\n      unjust and its conclusion to be totally against the record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">             In these appeals against acquittal, therefore, we do not find ourselves\n\n      persuaded to go by the order of acquittal passed by the High Court as the same,\n\n      in our considered view, was manifestly erroneous and perverse.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">      22.

As there was an earlier incident just four days prior to the occurrence\n\n      in question, in order to lend complete assurance and as a matter of prudence, a\n\n      criteria may be adopted where, if any of the eyewitnesses (other than PW6),\n\n      apart from and in addition to PWs 1 and 27 had adverted to and attributed overt\n\n      acts to any of the accused, the role of such accused can be taken to have been\n\n      established beyond any doubt.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">             We must hasten to add that the principle in Masalti5 would get attracted\n\n      where apart from attribution of presence, nothing more was attributed by way\n\n      of any overt act. However, in the facts of the instant case; and to rule out any\n\n      possibility of over-implication we have adopted this criteria, more particularly\n\n      because we are considering the matter in appeals against acquittal. Thus,\n\n      accused A1, A6, A7, A8, A10 and A13 are those who were attributed certain\n\n      overt acts not only by PWs 1 and 27 but at least by one more witness, whereas,\n\n      the role attributed to the rest of them was only by PWs 1 and 27 without any\n\n      other eyewitnesses apart from PW6, deposing about the role played by them.\n\fCriminal Appeal No…………………of 2021 etc. [arising out of SLP(Crl.)No. 8676 of 2019 etc.)\nState of Rajasthan etc. vs. Bablu @ Om Prakash etc.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                                                          34</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">      24.
