Emperor (A.I.R. 1943 Patna 18)  and  Delhi\nCloth  Mills v. Income-tax Commissioner, Delhi (A.I.R.\t1927\nP.C. 242), referred to.\nThe  purpose  of  identification  parades  being  to  enable\nwitnesses to identify the properties involved or the persons\nconcerned  in  the  offence under  investigation,  the\tvery\nprocess\t of  identification  involves  a  statement  by\t the\nidentifying  witness that the particular property or  person\nidentified was concerned in the offence.  This statement may\nbe express or implied.\tSuch a statement, whether express or\nimplied,  including  signs and gestures, would amount  to  a\ncommunication\tof  the\t fact  of  identification   by\t the\nidentifier to another person, and where the  identifications\nare held in the presence of the Police, such  communications\nare  tantamount to statements made by the identifiers  to  a\nPolice\tOfficer\t in  the course of  investigation  and\tcome\nwithin the ban of<a href=\"/doc/28293445/\" id=\"a_18\"> s. 162</a> of the Code.  The physical fact  of\nidentification\thas  no separate existence  apart  from\t the\nstatement  involved in the very process\t of  identification,\nand in so far as a Police Officer seeks to prove the fact of\nsuch  identification,  such evidence would  be\tinadmissible\nunder  s.  162\tof the Code, the only  exception  being\t the\nevidence  sought  to be given by the identifier\t himself  in\nregard to his mental act of identification which he would be\nentitled  to give by way of corroboration of  his  identifi-\ncation of the accused at the trial.\nWhere  the Police Officers arrange the parade,\tproduce\t the\nparsons\t who  are  to  be mixed up  with  the  accused,\t and\nwithdraw,  leaving the actual parade solely and\t exclusively\nin   charge   of  Panch\t witnesses,  and  the\tprocess\t  of\nidentification is carried out under the exclusive  direction\nand  supervision  of  the Panch\t witnesses,  the  statements\ninvolved  in the process of identification would  be  state-\nments  made  by the identifiers to the Panch  witnesses\t and\nwould be outside the purview of<a href=\"/doc/28293445/\" id=\"a_19\"> s. 162</a> of the Code.\nKhabiruddin  v.\t Emperor (A.I.R. 1943  Cal.  644);  Surendra\nDinda  v.

Emperor (A.I.R.  1946\tCal.\n452), referred to.\nPer  JAGANNADHADASJ.-Differentiation between the evidence of\na Police Officer and that of Panch witnesses and identifying\nwitnesses relating to the fact of prior identification in  a\nparade held by a Police Officer on the ground of the  latter\nbeing  corroborative evidence, is unsound and  inadmissible,\nand the evidence of the\n905\nPanch  witnesses and identifying witnesses relating  to\t the\nfact  of prior identification would be inadmissible even  as\ncorroborative evidence.\n<a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_20\">Section\t 27</a> of the Indian Evidence Act is based on the\tview\nthat  if  a fact is actually discovered\t in  consequence  of\ninformation  given, some guarantee is afforded thereby\tthat\nthe  information  was  true and accordingly  can  be  safely\nallowed to be given in evidence.  But clearly the extent  of\nthe  information admissible must depend on the exact  nature\nof the fact discovered to which such information is required\nto relate.\nKottaya v. Emperor (A.I.R. 1947 P.O. 67), referred to.\nWhere evidence was given by a Police Officer that &quot;in conse-\nquence\tof a certain statement made by the accused&quot; and\t &quot;at\nthe instance of the accused&quot;, a tin box was dug out of a mud\nhouse,\tand the nature of the statement made or\t information\ngiven by the accused was not sought to be proved, s. 27\t was\nnot  attracted and prima facie there was nothing to  prevent\nthe evidence being admitted against the accused concerned.\nDurlav\tNamasudra v. -Emperor ([1931] I.L.R. 59 Cal.  1040),\nreferred to.\nPer  JAGANNADHADAS  J.-There is considerable  force  in\t the\nobjection  that when a Police Officer speaks to a  discovery\nbeing  made  &quot;at  the  instance\t of  the  accused&quot;  or\t &quot;in\nconsequence  of\t information  given  by\t the  accused&quot;,\t the\nprosecution  cannot  be permitted to rely on  such  evidence\nwithout placing the admissible portion of the information on\nrecord.\t  The  information given by the accused\t in  such  a\nsituation  may be such as, on scrutiny, might show only\t his\nremote connection and not direct connection with the objects\nrecovered.   In such a situation, evidence of the bare\tfact\nof   information  having  been\tgiven  may   cause   serious\nprejudice.\nSumming up to the Jury does not mean merely giving a summary\nof the evidence.  The Judge should marshall the evidence  so\nas to bring out the lights and the shades, the probabilities\nand improbabilities, so as to give proper assistance to\t the\nJury who are to decide which view of the facts is true.\t The\ncharge\tshould not consist of along rambling  repetition  of\nthe  evidence,\twithout any attempt to\tmarshall  the  facts\nunder  appropriate heads, or to assist the Jury to sift\t and\nweigh  the  evidence so that they may be in A.\tposition  to\nunderstand  which  are\tthe really important  parts  of\t the\nevidence and which are of secondary importance.\nIlu v. Emperor (A.I.R. 1934 Cal. 847) and Nabi Khan v.\tKing\nEmperor (A.I.R. 1936 Cal. 186), referred to.\nHeld,  that as regards accused 4 there had been an error  of\nlaw in admitting evidence of the test identification parades\nrelating  to  him.   The  admission  of\t such\tinadmissible\nevidence would amount to a misdirection; but misdirection by\nitself\twould not be a ground for reversal under a.  537  of\nthe  Code unless such misdirection had in fact occasioned  a\nfailure of justice, nor is reception\n906\nof   evidence  inadmissible  under  s.\t162  of\t the   &#x27;Code\nnecessarily  fatal.  The Appellate Court has to see  whether\nthe  reception of inadmissible evidence influenced the\tmind\nof  the\t Jury so seriously as to lead them to  a  conclusion\nwhich might have been different but for its reception.\tWhat\nthe Appellate Court should do is to exclude the inadmissible\nevidence from the record and consider whether the balance of\nevidence  is  sufficient to maintain  the  conviction.\t The\nCourt\tof   Appeal  should  take  the\t whole\t case\tinto\nconsideration  and determine for itself whether the  verdict\nof the Jury was justified or whether there had in fact\tbeen\na  failure of justice.\tThe Court of Appeal is\tentitled  to\nsubstitute its own verdict for the verdict of the Jury if on\nexamining  the record for itself it comes to the  conclusion\nthat the verdict of the Jury was erroneous or that there had\nbeen a failure of justice in the sense that a guilty man has\nbeen acquitted or an innocent man his been convicted.\nAbdul Rahim v.

On a day previous\nto the day when cash was to be sent, the Head Cashier  would\ngive  the  currency notes to the Assistant Cashiers.

The  Assistant\nCashiers  would then put the cash into a leather  bag  which\nbag would be attached by an iron chain to the person of\t the\npeon.\tThe  Lloyds  Bank it appears had  received  a  large\ndeposit from the Bank of Iran a few days prior to the day in\nquestion  and it was decided that an amount of Rs. 12  lakhs\nshould\tbe  sent to the Reserve Bank of India  on  the\t20th\nApril, 1951.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">In the morning of the 20th April, the escort party consisted\nof  Brightling, Sarkari and Doctor and the peon Rama  Madura\nand taxi No. BMT 1829 was summoned to carry the party to the\nReserve\t Bank.\tThe escort party emerged from the rear\tdoor\nof  the Bank and went up to the taxi.  Bala Gopal  Kadam,  a\nwatchman,  was\ton duty on Bastion Road.   When\t the  escort\nparty  came out, the taxi&#x27;s bonnet was in the  direction  of\nthe  Empire Cinema and the driver Lawrence Quardros  was  at\nthe  driver&#x27;s seat.  Brightling got into the taxi first\t and\ntook  his  seat on the rear seat and was  followed  by\tRama\nMadura.\t Sarkari went round in front and took his seat\tnext\nto  the\t taxi driver.  Rama Madura after entering  the\ttaxi\nplaced the bag on the taxi&#x27;s floor and was about to take his\nseat.\tDoctor was standing with his left hand on  the\trear\ndoor of the taxi on the Bank side waiting for Rama Madura to\ntake  his seat.\t It was at this juncture that accused  1,  2\nand 4, Rubidas and Bankelal attacked the taxi and the escort\nparty.\tOne of these persons first wrenched open the door to\nthe taxi driver&#x27;s seat, leaned inside and fired twice with a\nrevolver.   One of these shots caused an injury to  Lawrence\nQuadros\t near the collar bone, which almost  instantaneously\ncaused his death and his body came out with the head  first.\nThe  man who so shot after leaning into the taxi went  round\nthe front of the taxi and took his seat next to the driver&#x27;s\nseat.  There was another man behind this one when the driver\nwas  shot, and he pulled out Lawrence Quadros from the\ttaxi\nand  took  his\tseat at the steering wheel.   That  man\t was\nRubidas-one  time  a motor driver in the employ of  the\t Pan\nAmerican  Airways  at Delhi.  Accused I also  Armed  with  a\nrevolver stood on the road side of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">909</span>\ntaxi and fired twice at the taxi from that side and  accused\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">2  and\t4 were, either at the back or on the Bank  side\t and\nwere also armed with revolvers.\t Sarkari first thought\tthat\nthese  shots were tyre-bursts and naturally got out  of\t his\nseat  to  inspect  the tyres but hearing  further  shots  he\nrealised  that an attempt was being made to loot  the  cash.\nHe got frightened and went in the direction of Outram  Road.\nBrightling got out of the taxi, first went a little  towards\nthe  back  of  the taxi and then seeing that  the  taxi\t was\nsurrounded,  zigzagged\tand  went towards  the\tjunction  of\nOutram\tand Bastion Roads where he tried  unsuccessfully  to\nstop  a passing car.  Accused 1 who was firing at  the\ttaxi\ncame  near it, opened the back door of the taxi on the\troad\nside  with  his shoulder and got into the taxi.\t  Accused  2\ncame towards the rear door of the taxi on the Bank side\t and\nfired at Doctor injuring him on the dorsum of his left palm.\nKadam  at about this time raised his baton,  realising\tthat\nDoctor was in danger whereupon accused 2 shouted &quot;Khabardar,\nchhod do chale jao, bhago&quot; or words to that effect and\tshot\nat him injuring him in his right eye.  That injury  resulted\nin the total loss of his right eye.  Both the accused 2\t and\n4  were armed with revolvers.  A driver by name\t Sarvarkhan,\nwas  sitting on the foot-path near the taxi and seeing\t:the\nbody  of Lawrence Quadros falling out of the taxi &#x27;he  tried\nto  go up to him but the accused 4 prevented him from  doing\nso  shouting at him &quot;khabardar&quot; and threatened him with\t his\nrevolver.&quot; During the course of the attack someone of  these\nmen shot at Rama Madura.  Rama Madura became unconscious and\naccused\t 2 and another dragged him out from the\t taxi.\t The\ntaxi  was then started whereupon Brightling, who was  still.\non Bastion Road, after making signals to the Cash Department\nto show as to what was taking place picked up a motor  cycle\nparked\tnear the corner of the Parsi  Lying-in-Hospital\t and\nthrew it in the way of the taxi but Rubidas, who was driving\nthat  taxi, managed to drive it away.  The taxi however\t had\nto be first driven at a slow speed and one Major Casey,\t who\nwas standing at the corner of the foot-path saw the whole of\nthe incident and also those inside the taxi when it was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">910</span>\ndriven past him.  The prosecution alleged that accused 1,  2\nand  4,\t Rubidas and Bankelal surrounded and  ,attacked\t the\ntaxi  and its inmates and after snatching away the bag\ttied\nto Rama Madura&#x27;s belt with the cash containing Rs. 12  lakhs\ndrove  away  in\t that  taxi.   Brightling  and\tsome   other\nemployees  of the Bank after some time secured a  car  which\nwas  parked nearby and went round in search of the taxi\t but\nto  no purpose.\t Brightling then reported the matter to\t the\nEsplanade  Police  Station  but before\tthat  the  telephone\noperator  of  the  Bank, Mrs. Paterson who  with  Miss\tVida\nPalmer,\t a clerk, had seen the incident from the  window  on\nthe mezzanine floor had telephoned to the police and several\npolice\tofficers arrived at the Bank soon  after.   Lawrence\nQuadros\t was  already  dead and his body  was  sent  to\t the\n&#x27;morgue.   Doctor, Kadam and Rama Madura, who had  all\tbeen\ninjured, were sent to St. George&#x27;s Hospital.  The taxi which\nwas  driven  away by Rubidas with the accused  and  Bankelal\nseated\ttherein was found abandoned at about 1-30  P.m.,  on\nthat very day by the police not far from the Kashmir Hotel.\nThe  police  made  various efforts to trace  accused  4\t and\nBankelal  but  were unable to find them and  they  therefore\ncharge-sheeted\taccused 1, 2 and Rubidas (who  was  original\naccused 3) and they were all committed to stand their  trial\nin  the Sessions Court.\t After those proceedings  were\tover\nthe  accused 4 was arrested on the 25th December, at  Bareli\nStation, and he too was charge-sheeted and was committed  to\nSessions.  Rubidas, the original accused 3, died on the\t 3rd\nAugust, 1952, with the result that accused 1, 2 and 4  stood\ntheir  trial on the charges under <a href=\"/doc/1119707/\" id=\"a_23\">section, 395</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1865117/\" id=\"a_24\">397</a> and\t <a href=\"/doc/958439/\" id=\"a_25\">396</a>\nof the Indian Penal Code.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">The  defence  of the accused 1, 2 and 4 was  that  they\t had\nnothing to do with the incident in question which took place\nin  the morning of the 20th April, 1951.   Though  conceding\nthat they had been in Bombay, accused 1 and 4 contended that\naccused\t I had left Bombay on the night of the\t18th  April,\nand  accused  4 had left Bombay either on the 16th  or\t17th\nApril,\tfor Allahabad, that they were not in Bombay &#x27;on\t the\nday in question but were in Allahabad where they had filed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">911</span>\ntwo affidavits before one Tondon, the first class Magistrate\nat Allahabad.

If this background is  kept  in\nview  it is clear that the process of identification by\t the\nidentifying   witnesses\t involves  the\tstatement   by\t the\nidentifying   witnesses\t that  the   particular\t  properties\nidentified  were  the subject-matter of the offence  or\t the\npersons\t identified  -were concerned in the  offence.\tThis\nstatement  may\tbe express or implied.\tThe  identifier\t may\npoint  out  by\this finger or -touch  the  property  or\t the\nperson.\t identified,  may either nod his head  or  give\t his\nassent\tin  answer to a question addressed to  him  in\tthat\nbehalf or may make signs or gestures which are tantamount to\nsaying\tthat  the  particular property\tidentified  was\t the\nsubject-matter\tof the offence or the person identified\t was\nconcerned  in the offence.  All these statements express  or\nimplied\t including the signs and gestures would amount to  a\ncommunication\tof  the\t fact  of  identification   by\t the\nidentifier  to\tanother person.\t The  distinction  therefore\nwhich  has been made by the Calcutta and the Allahabad\tHigh\nCourts\tbetween\t the mental act of  identification  and\t the\ncommunication thereof by the identifier to another person is\nquite  logical\tand such communications\t are  tantamount  to\nstatements  made by the identifiers to a police\t officer  in\nthe  course  of\t investigation and come within\tthe  ban  of\n<a href=\"/doc/28293445/\" id=\"a_75\">section\t 162</a>.  The physical fact of identification has\tthus\nno  separate existence apart from the statement involved  in\nthe very process of identification and in so far as a police\nofficer seeks to prove the fact of such identification\tsuch\nevidence  of his would attract the operation of <a href=\"/doc/28293445/\" id=\"a_76\">section\t 162</a>\nand  would be inadmissible in evidence, the  only  exception\nbeing the evidence sought to be given by the identifier him-\nself in regard to his mental act of identification which  he\nwould  be  entitled to give by way of corroboration  of\t his\nidentification\tof the accused at the trial.

Consider this question carefully and then if\t you\nfind  after  scrutiny of this evidence that  there  were  at\nleast  five men conjointly concerned then only\tsection\t 395\nwould  apply.

Their evidence did not definitely\nsay  that these five persons were the persons  concerned  in\nthe commission of the offence and that some of them might as\nwell have been passersby or Baburao Raje or Sarvarkhan,\t who\nhappened to be present there at the scene of the  occurrence\nand  were certainly not concerned in the commission  of\t the\noffence.   It  was also pointed out that  Holmes,  the\tsub-\nmanager\t of  the  Bank, who witnessed  the  occurrence\tfrom\nbehind\tthe  double  glasses of the windows  was  not  in  a\nposition to know how many persons actually took part in\t the\naffair\tand  was  also not in a position  to  see  how\tmany\npersons had got into the taxi.\tWe have carefully considered\nthese  criticisms of the evidence of the  several  witnesses\nbut are unable to come to the conclusion that there was\t any\nmisdirection on the part of the learned Judge in his summing\nup to the jury.\t The evidence of each of these witnesses was\ndiscussed by the learned Judge and the main defects and con-\ntradictions  in their evidence were clearly pointed  out  by\nhim  to\t the  jury.

The  admission\nof such inadmissible evidence would amount to a misdirection\nin the learned Judge&#x27;s charge to the jury in regard to\tthat\naccused and it is necessary therefore to consider what would\nbe the effect of the admission of such inadmissible evidence\nso far as that accused is concerned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">Learned counsel for the accused relied upon the observations\nin  Kabiruddin\tv.

The legal permissibility thereof  is  a\nmatter\tof importance because, though the evidence of  prior\nidentification\tis only corroborative evidence,\t still\tsuch\ncorroboration  is  of considerable value in  cases  of\tthis\nkind.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_64\">Next  as  regards  the objection  to  the  admissibility  of\nevidence  raised with reference to <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_123\">section 27</a> of the  Indian\nEvidence  Act,\tthe  main  items of  evidence  are  (1)\t the\nrecovery  on  the 16th May, 1951, of a\ttin  box  containing\nthree revolvers and two tins containing live cartridges, and\n(2)  the  find\ton  the 19th May, 1951,\t of  a\tsteel  trunk\ncontaining  Government\tcurrency notes of the value  of\t Rs.\n6,47,400 on the production thereof by Kamalabai, the wife of\nthe first accused, at a village Bhagwasi which is her native\nplace.\t So far as the first is concerned it is not of\tmuch\nconsequence  because the expert evidence did not  show\tthat\nany  of the three bullets which were found at the  scene  of\noffence were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">939</span>\nin  fact fired from the three revolvers above recovered\t and\nthis  has been sufficiently indicated in the charge  to\t the\njury.\tIt is the second item that is of  importance.\tThis\narises\tfrom  the fact that some of the currency  notes\t had\nidentification\tmarks  showing that they were  part  of\t the\nbundle of notes which formed the object of the offence.\t The\nevidence  in  this behalf is that of the  Police  Inspector,\nP.W. 80, which is as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">&quot;We started from Delhi at about 6 &#x27;A.M., and reached Bagwasi\nat  about 2 or 3 P.m., on the 19th of May.  The 1st  accused\ntook  us  to a certain house where he  pointed\tout  witness\nKamala (wife of the first accused).  At the instance of\t the\n1st  accused witness Kamala brought from  somewhere  outside\nthat house a steel box........... When it was opened I found\ntherein six big bundles and five smaller bundles of  hundred\nrupee G. C. Notes.  &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">The  portion in this evidence which is objected to  is\tthat\nthis  production was &quot;at the instance of the first  accused&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">seeking\t thereby to establish the direct connection  of\t the\nfirst accused with the find of this very large sum of  money\nwhich bears indications that it was out of that lost to\t the\nBank  by the offence.  It may be that when a police  officer\nspeaks\tto a recovery being &quot;on the information of&quot;  or\t &quot;at\nthe  instance  of&quot;  an accused, <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_124\">section\t 27</a>  of\t the  Indian\nEvidence  Act  is  not\tin terms  attracted.   But  what  is\nobjected  to  on  behalf of the appellants is  that  when  a\npolice\tofficer speaks to a recovery of this kind as  having\nbeen  &quot;at the instance of an accused&quot; or &quot;in consequence  of\ninformation  given  by an accused&quot; he is  being\t allowed  to\nplace  on record not merely the fact of his having  received\nsome  information  but also the implication  thereof,  viz.,\nthat  the information is of a character which directly\tcon-\nnects  the accused with the objects recovered.\tIt is  urged\nthat  the  prosecution cannot be permitted to rely  on\tsuch\nevidence  without  placing  the admissible  portion  of\t the\ninformation  on\t the record.  I am inclined  to\t think\tthat\nthere\tis  considerable  force\t in  this  objection.\t The\ninformation given by ;in accused in such a situation may  be\nsuch which, if scrutinised, shows only his\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">940</span>\nremote\tconnection  and not direct connection.\t In  such  a\nsituation  evidence of the bare fact of\t information  having\nbeen  given may be inadmissible and such evidence may  cause\nserious\t prejudice.   I am not, therefore, prepared  to\t say\nthat  the  view\t expressed by Chief Justice  Chagla  in\t the\nunreported  judgment(1), placed before us is  erroneous.   I\nwould\treserve\t my  opinion  in  this\tbehalf\tfor   fuller\nconsideration.\t In the present case, however, even  if\t the\nevidence of the police officer that the recovery was at\t the\ninstance  of or in consequence of information  furnished  by\nthe  first  accused is ruled out, there is  still  the\tfact\nspoken\tto  by him that the trunk  containing  the  currency\nnotes was produced by Kamalabai, wife of the first  accused,\nat  her\t native\t place.\t This item of  evidence\t is  clearly\nadmissible  against  the first, accused\t as  indicating\t his\nconnection.  Therefore no prejudice can be said to have been\ncaused.\t  It is also to be noticed that no  objection  under\nsect ion 27 of the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_125\">Indian Evidence Act</a> appears to have\tbeen\ntaken at the trial nor is there any indication of it in\t the\ngrounds of appeal to the High Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">In  view of our opinion that the evidence of  identification\nparades relating to. the fourth accused was inadmissible, we\nwere &#x27;taken through the rest of the evidence as against this\naccused.. I agree, on a consideration of that evidence, that\nthis  is not a case in which interference with\tthe  verdict\neven as against the fourth accused is called for.\nAppeals dismissed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">(i)  judgment  of the Bombay High Court in Criminal  Appeals\nNos.  454 and 464 Of 1949 in the case of Rex  v.
