We need not go into these questions as the\nrecord clearly indicates that an objection was raised by the\nAdvocate appearing for the appellant&#x27;s right at the initial\nstage that the evidence was being recorded without ensuring\nthe presence of the appellants in Court. There was neither\nany willingness on the part of the appellants nor any order\nor direction by the Trial Court that the evidence be recorded\nin the absence of the appellants. The matter, therefore,\nwould not come within the scope of the latter part of\nSection 273 and it cannot be said that there was any\ndispensation as contemplated by the said Section. We will,\ntherefore, proceed on the footing that there was no\ndispensation and yet the evidence was recorded without\nensuring the presence of the accused. The High Court was,\ntherefore, absolutely right in concluding that Section 273\nstood violated in the present matter and that there was an\ninfringement of the salutary principle under Section 273.\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1232065\" id=\"span_29\">The submissions advanced by Shri Sanjay Hegde, learned\nSenior Advocate, relying upon paragraphs in <a href=\"/doc/1232065/\" id=\"a_43\">Jayendra\nVishnu Thakur Vs.

The aforementioned observations in Jayendra Vishnu\nThakur must be read in the peculiar factual context of the\nmatter. The accused Jayendra Vishnu Thakur was tried in\nrespect of certain offences in a Court in Delhi and at the\nsame time he was also an accused in a trial under the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_48\">TADA Act</a> [<a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_49\">Terrorists and Anti Disruptive\nActivities (Prevention) Act, 1987</a>] in a Court in Pune. The\ntrial in the Court in Pune proceeded on the basis that\nJayendra Vishnu Thakur was an absconding accused. The\nevidence was thus led in the trial in Pune in his absence\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                              16</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                           CRRFC.09/2019</span>\n                  The State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.

The State of Madhya Pradesh\n\nwhen he was not sent up for trial, at the end of which all the\naccused were acquitted. However, in an appeal arising\ntherefrom, this Court convicted some of the accused for\noffences with which they were tried. In the meantime,\nJayendra Vishnu Thakur was convicted by the Court in\nDelhi and was undergoing sentence imposed upon him.\nLater, he was produced before the Court in Pune with a\nsupplementary charge-sheet and charges were framed\nagainst him along with certain other accused. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1232065\" id=\"span_38\">A request was\nmade by the Public Prosecutor that the evidence of some of\nthe witnesses, which was led in the earlier trial be read in\nevidence in the fresh trial against Jayendra Vishnu Thakur\nas those witnesses were either dead or not available to be\nexamined [<a href=\"/doc/1232065/\" id=\"a_50\">Paras 8 and 9 of Jayendra Vishnu Thakur Vs.\nState of Maharashtra</a> (supra)]. The request was allowed\nwhich order of the Court in Pune was under challenge\nbefore this Court. It was found by this Court that the basic\npremise for application of Section 299 of the Code was\ncompletely absent. The Accused had not absconded. He was\nvery much in confinement and could have been produced in\nthe earlier trial before the Court in Pune. Since the\nrequirements of Section 299 were not satisfied, the\nevidence led on the earlier occasion could not be taken as\nevidence in the subsequent proceedings. The witnesses\nwere not alive and could not be re-examined in the fresh\ntrial nor could there be cross-examination on behalf of the\naccused. If the evidence in the earlier trial was to be read in\nthe subsequent trial, the accused would be denied the\nopportunity of cross-examination of the concerned\nwitnesses. Thus, the prejudice was inherent. It is in this\nfactual context that the observations of this Court have to be\nconsidered. Same is not the situation in the present matter.\nIt is not the direction of the High Court to read the entire\nevidence on the earlier occasion as evidence in the de novo\ntrial. The direction is to re-examine those witnesses who\nwere not examined in the presence of the appellants. The\ndirection now ensures the presence of the appellants in the\nCourt, so that they have every opportunity to watch the\nwitnesses deposing in the trial and cross-examine said\nwitnesses. Since these basic requirements would be\nscrupulously observed and complied with, there is no\nprejudice at all.</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                             17</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                                          CRRFC.09/2019</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">                 The State of Madhya Pradesh Vs.

According to Section 366 when a Court of Sessions\npasses a sentence of death, the proceedings must be\nsubmitted to the High Court and the sentence of death is not\nto be executed unless it is confirmed by the High Court.\nSection 367 then proceeds to lay down the power of the\nHigh Court to direct further enquiry to be made or\nadditional evidence to be taken. Section 368, thereafter, lays\ndown the power of the High Court to confirm the sentence\nso imposed or annul the conviction. One of the powers\nwhich the High Court can exercise is one under Section\n368(c) of the Code and that is to &quot;acquit the accused\nperson&quot;. Pertinently, the power to acquit the person can be\nexercised by the High Court even without there being any\nsubstantive appeal on the part of the accused challenging\nhis conviction. To that extent the proceedings under Chapter\nXXVIII which deals with &quot;submission of death sentences\nfor confirmation&quot; is a proceeding in continuation of the\ntrial. These provisions thus entitle the High Court to direct\nfurther enquiry or to take additional evidence and the High\nCourt may, in a given case, even acquit the accused person.\nThe scope of the chapter is wider. Chapter XXIX of the\nCode deals with &quot;Appeals&quot;. Section 391 also entitles the\nAppellate Court to take further evidence or direct such\nfurther evidence to be taken. Section 386 then enumerates\npowers of the Appellate Court which inter alia includes the\npower to &quot;reverse the finding and sentence and acquit or\ndischarge the accused, or order him to be re-tried by a Court\nof competent jurisdiction subordinate to such Appellate\nCourt or committed for trial&quot;. The powers of Appellate\nCourt are equally wide. The High Court in the present case\nwas exercising powers both under Chapters XXVIII and\nXXIX of the Code. If the power can go to the extent of\nordering a complete re-trial, the exercise of power to a\nlesser extent namely ordering de novo examination of\ntwelve witnesses with further directions as the High Court\nhas imposed in the present matter, was certainly within the\npowers of the High Court. There is, thus, no infraction or\njurisdictional error on the part of the High Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">23.

The State of Madhya Pradesh\n\nmatter was not to enable the Prosecutor to rectify the\ndefects or infirmities in the evidence or to enable him to\nlead evidence which he had not cared to lead on the earlier\noccasion.

We must also consider the matter from the stand point\nand perspective of the victims as suggested by the learned\nAmicus Curiae. Four persons of a family were done to\ndeath. It is certainly in the societal interest that the guilty\nmust be punished and at the same time the procedural\nrequirements which ensure fairness in trial must be adhered\nto. If there was an infraction, which otherwise does not\nvitiate the trial by itself, the attempt must be to remedy the\nsituation to the extent possible, so that the interests of the\naccused as well as societal interest are adequately\nsafeguarded. The very same witnesses were directed to be\nde novo examined which would ensure that the interest of\nthe prosecution is sub-served and at the same time the\naccused will have every right and opportunity to watch the\nwitnesses deposing against them, watch their demeanor and\ninstruct their Counsel properly so that said witnesses can be\neffectively cross-examined. In the process, the interest of\nthe accused would also stand protected. On the other hand,\nif we were to accept the submission that the proceedings\nstood vitiated and, therefore, the High Court was powerless\nto order de novo examination of the concerned witnesses, it\nwould result in great miscarriage of justice. The persons\nwho are accused of committing four murders would not\neffectively be tried. The evidence against them would not\nbe read for a technical infraction resulting in great\nmiscarriage. Viewed thus, the order and directions passed\nby the High Court completely ensure that a fair procedure is\nadopted and the depositions of the witnesses, after due\ndistillation from their cross-examination can be read in\nevidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">26.
