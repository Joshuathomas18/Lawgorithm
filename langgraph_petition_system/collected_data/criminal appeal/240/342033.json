To meet the challenge of terrorists indulging in wanton\n\nkillings, arson,   looting, and other heinous crimes in various\n\nparts of <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_8\">India, the Terrorist and Disruptive Activities (Prevention)\n\nAct</a> (hereinafter referred to as `TADA&#x27;) was enacted by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                                                  4</span>\n\n\nParliament in the year 1985.     There was widespread criticism\n\nthat TADA contained some draconian provisions.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1813801\" id=\"span_3\">5.   The constitutional validity of TADA was challenged before\n\nthis Court in <a href=\"/doc/1813801/\" id=\"a_9\">KARTAR SINGH       Vs. STATE OF PUNJAB</a> - (1994)\n\n3 SCC 569. It was contended before this Court that many of the\n\nstringent provisions of TADA were likely to be abused by the\n\npolice. In particular, it was submitted that the provisions relating\n\nto confession made to the police may lead to illegal extraction of\n\nconfessions by the police; and that the provision relating to grant\n\nof bail were violative of human rights and the fundamental rights\n\nguaranteed by the Constitution of India.      While upholding the\n\nconstitutional validity of TADA, this Court observed that it was\n\nnecessary to ensure that the provisions of the Act were not\n\nmisused by the security agencies/Police. Certain guidelines were\n\nset out to ensure that confessions obtained in pre-indictment\n\ninterrogation by the police will be in conformity with principles of\n\nfundamental fairness. This Court also indicated that the Central\n\nGovernment     should    take   note   of   those   guidelines   by\n\nincorporating them in TADA and the rules framed thereunder by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                                                         5</span>\n\n\nappropriate amendments. This Court also held that in order to\n\nprevent the misuse of the provisions of TADA, there must be\n\nsome Screening or Review Committees.              In the lead judgment,\n\nPandian, J. held (para 265) :</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     &quot;In order to ensure higher level of scrutiny and applicability\n     of <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_10\">TADA Act</a>, there must be a screening Committee or a\n     Review Committee constituted by the Central Government\n     consisting of the Home Secretary, Law Secretary and other\n     secretaries concerned of the various Departments to review\n     all the TADA cases instituted by the Central Government as\n     well as to have a quarterly administrative review, reviewing\n     the States&#x27; action in the application of the TADA provisions\n     in the respective States, and the incidental questions arising\n     in relation thereto. Similarly, there must be a Screening or\n     Review Committee at the State level constituted by the\n     respective States consisting of the Chief Secretary, Home\n     Secretary, Law Secretary, Director General of Police (Law and\n     Order) and other officials as the respective Government may\n     think it fit, to review the action of the enforcing authorities\n     under the Act and screen the cases registered under the\n     provisions of the Act and decide the further course of action\n     in every matter and so on.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">6.   In 1995, TADA was allowed to lapse.

It was contended, inter alia, that\n\nenacting a provision that made the decisions of the Review\n\nCommittee        binding    on     the     State      Government        was   an\n\nencroachment upon the power and authority of the State to\n\nprosecute an offender.          It was also contended that a provision\n\nthat a proceeding pending in a court shall be deemed to have\n\nbeen withdrawn when the Review Committee opined that there is\n\nno prima facie case for proceeding against the accused, would\n\namount to interference with judicial functions and encroachment\n\nof   `judicial   power&#x27;    by    the     executive,    in   violation    of   the\n\nconstitutional scheme.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                                                               9</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">9.     The High Court of Madras upheld the validity of sub-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">sections (4) to (7) of <a href=\"/doc/823094/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 60</a> of POTA. But it further held that\n\nthe opinion rendered by the Review Committee would not result\n\nin automatic withdrawal of cases pending in court; that as the\n\nopinion was binding on the State government, the State\n\ngovernment was bound to instruct the Public Prosecutor to\n\nwithdraw the prosecution under Section 321 of the Code; that\n\nthe public prosecutor should apply his mind and then file an\n\napplication seeking the consent of the court; and that only on\n\nsuch     consent      being    given,     the   proceedings       shall     stand\n\nwithdrawn. The High Court held:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">       &quot;The exercise of power by the Review committee cannot be\n       termed as scuttling the judicial process... Criminal cases are\n       deemed to be pending and can be concluded only on the\n       delivery of judgment. Upto that stage, the prosecution can\n       always be withdrawn subject to such limitations as are\n       prescribed in <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_24\">section 321</a> Cr.PC. ... A plea made to the\n       Public Prosecutor to withdraw the proceedings cannot be\n       construed as an encroachment on the judicial power. At any\n       stage before the pronouncement of the judgment in a\n       criminal case, the State Government can instruct the Public\n       Prosecutor to withdraw the prosecution. In POTA also, the\n       State Government can exercise such power. But if it is not\n       willing to do so, it does not bar the Review Committee\n       exercising the powers under <a href=\"/doc/823094/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 60</a> thereof and the\n       Review Committee can always decide as to whether, in its\n       opinion, the case is a fit one to proceed further even if it is in\n       part-heard stage. If the Review Committee comes to the\n       conclusion that the case is fit to be withdrawn from\n       prosecution under POTA, it can address the State\n       Government, which, in turn, has to instruct the Public\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                                                       1</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                       0</span>\n      Prosecutor to invoke <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_26\">section 321</a> of Code of Criminal\n      Procedure. The role of Review Committee is limited only that\n      far and no further. When the role of the Review Committee\n      ends, then it is for the Public Prosecutor to apply his mind\n      independently according to the well settled legal principles\n      interpreting <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_27\">section 321</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure and\n      ultimately it is for the Special Court trying the cases to\n      decide whether the plea of the Public Prosecutor to withdraw\n      the prosecution, if made, is acceptable or not..... It is only\n      <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_28\">section 321</a> of Cr.PC, which is applicable for withdrawing\n      prosecution under POTA. Hence, we hold that upto the stage\n      of formulating an opinion regarding prima facie case under\n      POTA, the Review Committee&#x27;s decision, one way or the\n      other, cannot amount to interference in the judicial process.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">10.   The State of Tamil Nadu challenged the judgment of the\n\nDivision Bench of Madras High Court by filing Special Leave\n\nPetition before this Court.

By judgment dated\n\n13.4.2005, the High Court upheld the constitutional validity of\n\nthe said provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/18231827/\" id=\"a_38\">Repealing Act</a>. The High Court was of\n\nthe view that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_39\">section 2(3)</a> of the Repealing Act\n\nwere similar to the provisions of section 60(4) to (7) of POTA.\n\nTherefore following the decision of Madras High Court relating\n\nto the validity of section 60(4) to (7) of POTA, it held that <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_40\">section\n\n2(3)</a>   of   the   Repealing   Act   did   not   dispense     with   the\n\nrequirements of Section       321 of the Code; and where            the\n\nReview Committee, in regard to any case where cognizance had\n\nbeen taken by the court, held that there was no prima facie case\n\nfor proceeding against the accused under the provisions of\n\nPOTA, such opinion of the Review Committee will not have the\n\neffect of deemed withdrawal of the case from the court, until the\n\nprocedure prescribed in section 321 of the Code was complied\n\nwith. The     said   conclusion     was   based   on   the   following\n\nreasoning :\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">\f                                                                         1</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                         4</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">      &quot;When the Parliament enacted the Repeal Act, it was aware\n      of the fact that the Division Bench of the Madras High Court\n      had made sub-section (7) of section 60 of the 2002 Act\n      subject to section 321 of the Code and the view of the\n      Madras High Court had been expressly approved by the\n      Supreme Court and yet it did not choose to exclude the\n      applicability of section 321 of the Code from the scheme of\n      section 2(3) of the Repeal Act. Rather, the language of sub-\n      section (7) read with <a href=\"/doc/109280502/\" id=\"a_41\">section 4</a> of the 2002 Act was\n      substantially retained in the Repeal Act. Thus, the\n      Parliament will be deemed to have accepted the\n      interpretation placed by the Madras High Court on the\n      provisions of sub-sections (4) to (7) of section 60 from the\n      scheme of section 2 of the Repeal Act is in our opinion,\n      inconsequential because the language of sub-section (3) of\n      <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_42\">section 2</a> thereof is substantially similar to sub-section (7) of\n      section 60 of the 2002 Act, in so far as they provide for\n      deemed withdrawal of the pending cases under the 2002 Act.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1208997\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1564949\" id=\"span_20\">13.

It is, therefore, clear that the Designated Court was right\n      in taking the view that withdrawal from prosecution is not to\n      be permitted mechanically by the court on an application for\n      that purpose made by the public prosecutor. It is equally\n      clear that the public prosecutor also has not to act\n      mechanically in the discharge of his statutory function\n      under <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 321</a> CrPC on such a recommendation being\n      made by the Review Committee; and that it is the duty of the\n      public prosecutor to satisfy himself that it is a fit case for\n      withdrawal from prosecution before he seeks the consent of\n      the court for that purpose.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">      8.

It was necessary for the public prosecutor to\n    satisfy himself in each case that the case is fit for withdrawal\n    from prosecution in accordance with the settled principles\n    indicated in the decisions of this Court and then to satisfy\n    the Designated Court of the existence of a ground which\n    permits withdrawal from prosecution under <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 321</a>\n    CrPC.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">    11. It has also to be borne in mind that the initial invocation\n    of the stringent provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_49\">TADA Act</a> is itself subject to\n    sanction of the Government and, therefore, the revised\n    opinion of the Government formed on the basis of the\n    recommendation of the High Power Committee after scrutiny\n    of each case should not be lightly disregarded by the court\n    except for weighty reasons such as mala fides or manifest\n    arbitrariness. The worth of the material to support the\n    charge under the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_50\">TADA Act</a> and the evidence which can be\n    produced, is likely to be known to the prosecuting agency\n    and, therefore, mere existence of prima facie material to\n    support the framing of the charge should not by itself be\n    treated as sufficient to refuse the consent for withdrawal\n    from prosecution. It is in this manner an application made to\n    withdraw the charges of offences under the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_51\">TADA Act</a>\n    pursuant to review of a case by the Review Committee has to\n    be considered and decided by the Designated Courts.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1208997\" id=\"span_26\"><a href=\"/doc/1208997/\" id=\"a_52\">Shaheen Welfare Association</a> (supra) also related to a case\n\nunder TADA where this court observed :</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">          &quot;The purpose of constituting such committees was to\n    ensure a higher level of scrutiny regarding applicability of\n    the provisions of TADA to the case in point.

We repeat for emphasis. To interdict, intercept\n    or jettison an enquiry or trial in a court, save in the manner\n    and to the extent provided         for in the Code itself, is\n    lawlessness. The even course of criminal justice cannot be\n    thwarted by the executive, however, high the accused,\n    however sure government feels a case is false, however\n    unpalatable the continuance of the prosecution to the\n    powers-that-be who wish to scuttle court justice because of\n    hubris, affection or other noble or ignoble consideration.\n    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184560188\" id=\"span_42\">Justicing, under our constitutional order, belongs to the\n    judges.

It\n\nshould be remembered that continuation of a proceedings in\n\nrespect of any offence under an Act, after the repeal of such Act,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">\f                                                                   3</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                                                   0</span>\n\nis itself as a result of a deeming fiction. Natural consequence of\n\nrepeal, as noticed above, is complete obliteration including\n\npending proceedings. Continuation of a pending proceeding is\n\npossible only on account of the deeming fiction created by the\n\nsavings   clause   in   the   <a href=\"/doc/18231827/\" id=\"a_101\">Repealing   Act</a>   which   provides   for\n\ncontinuation of the proceedings as if the Principal Act had not\n\nbeen repealed. Therefore any provision in the <a href=\"/doc/18231827/\" id=\"a_102\">Repealing Act</a> for\n\nsaving a pending proceeding, with any further provision for\n\ntermination of such pending proceedings, is a provision relating\n\nto `winding up&#x27; matters connected with the <a href=\"/doc/18231827/\" id=\"a_103\">Repealed Act</a>. By no\n\nstretch of imagination such a provision can be termed as\n\ninterference with judicial power, even assuming that such a\n\nprovision in a live unrepealed statute may be considered as\n\ninterference with judicial power. It is therefore unnecessary to\n\nexamine whether <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_104\">section 2(3)</a> of the Repealing Act is an\n\nencroachment of judicial power, though such an examination was\n\ndone with reference to the challenge to section 60(4) to (7) of\n\nPOTA. Many tests applied for deciding the constitutional validity\n\nof live and current statutes, may not apply to `winding up&#x27;\n\nprovisions in a savings clause of a <a href=\"/doc/18231827/\" id=\"a_105\">Repealing Act</a>, dealing with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">\f                                                                    3</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                                                    1</span>\n\nrepeal. The Parliament has the legislative competence to make\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/18231827/\" id=\"a_106\">Repealing Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/18231827/\" id=\"a_107\">The Repealing Act</a> repeals POTA and provides\n\nfor certain savings from repeal, to meet the special features of the\n\nrepealed statute. It does not violate any constitutional provisions.\n\nHence the Repealing Act and in particular <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_108\">section 2(3)</a> and (5)\n\nthereof are valid and constitutional.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">25.   This takes us to the second question as to the true import\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_109\">section 2(3)</a> of the Repealing Act. Sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_110\">section 2</a>\n\nof the Repealing Act makes it clear that the repeal of POTA will\n\nnot affect any investigation or legal proceeding in respect of any\n\npenalty or punishment under the principal Act, and any such\n\ninvestigation   or   legal   proceedings   may   be   instituted   or\n\ncontinued, as if the principal Act had not been repealed. The\n\nproviso to sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_111\">section 2</a> makes it clear that no\n\ncourt shall take cognizance of an offence under the principal\n\nAct after the expiry of the period of one year from the\n\ncommencement of the <a href=\"/doc/18231827/\" id=\"a_112\">Repealing Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/18231827/\" id=\"a_113\">The Repealing Act</a> came\n\ninto force on 21.9.2004 and the period of one year from the\n\ndate of repeal having also elapsed, no fresh offence punishable\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">\f                                                                   3</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                                                   2</span>\n\nunder the POTA can be taken cognizance of by the court from\n\n21.9.2005. Certain further provisions are made in regard to\n\npending proceedings in sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_114\">section 2</a> [sub-\n\nsections (4) and (5) of <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_115\">section 2</a> of the Repealing Act are merely\n\nsupplemental to sub-section 93) of <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_116\">section 2</a> and have no\n\nexistence independent of <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_117\">section 2(3)</a>]. Sub-section (3) provides\n\nthat notwithstanding the repeal of Section 60 of the principal\n\nAct,   the   Review   Committee   constituted    by    the   Central\n\nGovernment under sub-section (1) of Section 60, shall review\n\nwithin one year from the commencement of the repealing Act,\n\nall cases registered under the principal Act as to whether there\n\nis a prima facie case for proceeding against the accused\n\nthereunder; and where the Review Committee is of the opinion\n\nthat there is no prima facie case for proceeding against the\n\naccused, then, in cases in which cognizance has been taken by\n\nthe Court, the cases shall be deemed to have been withdrawn,\n\nand    in cases   in which   investigations     are   pending,   the\n\ninvestigations shall be closed forthwith, with effect from the\n\ndate of issuance of the direction by such Review Committee.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 2(3)</a> of the Repealing Act does not contemplate or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">\f                                                                   3</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                                                   3</span>\n\nprovide for compliance with section 321 of the Code, before the\n\nwithdrawal comes into effect. The clear intention of <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_119\">section 2(3)</a>\n\nof the Repealing Act is that when the Review Committee opines\n\nthat there is no prima facie case for proceeding against the\n\naccused, on review of the pending POTA cases, such cases,\n\neven though cognizance has been taken by the court, shall be\n\ndeemed to have been withdrawn without anything further to be\n\ndone. In view of expression of such clear legislative intent in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_120\">section 2(3)</a> of the Repealing Act, there is no question of\n\nbringing section 321 of the Code into play. If section 321 is held\n\nto be applicable, then the provision in <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_121\">section 2(3)</a> that the\n\ncases shall be deemed to be withdrawn, is rendered nugatory\n\nand   the   cases   are   not   actually   withdrawn   until   the\n\nrequirements of section 321 are complied with. That would\n\namount to rewriting <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_122\">section 2(3)</a> which is clearly impermissible.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">26.   The High Court proceeded on the basis that <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_123\">section 2(3)</a> of\n\nthe repealing Act is similar to section 60(4) to (7) of POTA, and\n\ntherefore it should be interpreted and dealt with in the same\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">\f                                                                 3</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">                                                                 4</span>\n\nmanner as section 60(4) to (7) of POTA. It noted that the\n\nMadras High Court had upheld the validity of section 60(4) to\n\n(7) of POTA by holding that the decision of the Review\n\nCommittee was binding only on the State Government and the\n\nInvestigating Officer and not on the Public prosecutor or the\n\ncourt, and that the procedure prescribed by section 321 of the\n\nCode will have to be complied with, even after the decision by\n\nthe Review Committee that there was no prima facie case to\n\nproceed against the accused. It held that the said declaration of\n\nlaw would also apply to <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_124\">section 2(3)</a> of the Repealing Act. It\n\ntherefore upheld the validity of <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_125\">section 2(3)</a> of the Repealing Act\n\nsubject to a rider that even where Review Committee has\n\nopined under <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_126\">section 2(3)</a> that there was no prima facie case,\n\nthe deemed withdrawal will be subject to fulfilment of the\n\nrequirements of section 321 of the Code. But the question is\n\nwhether the High Courts were justified in assuming in the\n\nimpugned judgments that the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_127\">section 2(3)</a> of the\n\nrepealing Act are similar to sections 60(4) to (7) of POTA, and\n\nthe decision of the Madras High Court as upheld by this Court,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">\f                                                               3</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                                               5</span>\n\nwill not apply while interpreting <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_128\">section 2(3)</a> of the Repealing\n\nAct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">27.    The Madras High Court proceeded on the basis that the\n\nexercise of power by the Review Committee in regard to review\n\nof POTA cases, was governed by sub-sections (4) to (6) of\n\nsection 60 of POTA. It found that these sub-sections provided\n\nthat the decision of the Review Committee on review, was\n\nbinding only on the State Government and police officers and\n\nnot on the public prosecutor or the court. The Madras High\n\ncourt got over sub-section (7) of section 60 of POTA (which\n\nprovided that when the Review Committee opines that there is\n\nno prima facie case, then the proceedings pending against the\n\naccused shall be deemed to have been withdrawn from the date\n\nof such direction), by holding that the said sub-section did not\n\ncreate any new right other than those mentioned in sub-\n\nsections (4) to (6) of section 60, and was only in the nature of\n\nan explanation spelling out the effect of the exercise of the\n\npower in sub-sections (4) to (6) of section 60 of POTA. It held\n\nthat sub-section (7) of section 60 cannot be read independently\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">\f                                                                 3</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                                                 6</span>\n\nby itself. It further held that sub-section (7) of section 60 of\n\nPOTA had to be understood only in the context of section 321 of\n\nthe Code, to mean that if the Review Committee forms an\n\nopinion that the prosecution of the accused did not attract the\n\nprovisions of POTA, the State Government which was bound by\n\nthe direction, will have to address the Public Prosecutor to\n\nwithdraw the prosecution; and as the public prosecutor was not\n\nbound by the direction of the Review Committee, he could\n\nformulate his independent opinion under section 321 of the\n\nCode.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">28.   But the scheme of <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_129\">section 2(3)</a> of the Repealing Act is\n\ndifferent from the scheme of sub-sections (4) to (7) of section 60\n\nof POTA. The scheme under sub-sections (4) to (7) of section 60\n\nunder POTA (which applied to proceedings initiated under\n\nPOTA when the Act was in force) was as follows : (a) the Review\n\nCommittee was required to review a POTA case under section\n\n60(4), only when an application was made by an aggrieved\n\nperson; (b) any direction issued by the Review Committee on\n\nsuch review, was binding on the concerned Government and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">\f                                                                3</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                                                7</span>\n\ninvestigating officer, but not the public prosecutor or the court\n\nunder section 321 of the Code. The scheme under <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_130\">section 2(3)</a>\n\nof the Repealing Act is categorical. The review by the Review\n\nCommittee is not dependent upon an application by any\n\naggrieved person. The Review Committee had to make a general\n\nreview of all cases registered under POTA which were pending\n\nat the time of repeal, irrespective of whether an application for\n\nreview was made by the accused or not. The purpose of such\n\ngeneral review was to identify the cases where there was no\n\nprima facie case for proceeding against the accused, so that\n\nthey could be withdrawn. If the Review Committee expressed\n\nthe opinion that there is no prima facie case for proceeding\n\nagainst the accused, then the cases pending in court, even\n\nwhere cognizance has been taken by the court, shall be deemed\n\nto have been withdrawn with effect from the date of issuance of\n\ndirection by such Review Committee. The express provision in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_131\">section 2(3)</a> of the Repealing Act that even where cognizance\n\nhas been taken by the court, the cases shall be deemed to have\n\nbeen withdrawn, is not found in section 60(4) to (7) of POTA.\n\nOnce the law made by the Parliament specifically states that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">\f                                                                3</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">                                                                8</span>\n\nwherever the Review Committee is of the opinion that there is\n\nno prima facie case for proceeding against the accused, the\n\ncases shall be deemed to have been withdrawn. If the\n\nParliament wanted to make the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_132\">section 2(3)</a> of the\n\nRepealing Act subject to Section 321 of the Code, it would have\n\nbeen done by making appropriate provisions therefor. As that\n\nis not done, plain meaning of the words of the legislation has to\n\nbe given effect to.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">29.   <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_133\">Section 2(3)</a> of the Repealing Act also contains clear\n\nindications which exclude section 321 of the Code. They are : (i)\n\nThe review is by Review Committee with a sitting or retired\n\nJudge of the High Court as the Chairman, having the power of\n\na civil court in respect of discovery and production of\n\ndocuments and requisitioning records. (ii) All cases registered\n\nunder POTA are required to be reviewed irrespective of whether\n\nany application was made by an aggrieved person or not, so as\n\nto find out whether there is a prima facie case for proceeding\n\nagainst the accused under POTA; (iii) The sub-section clearly\n\nprovides that where a Review Committee opines that there is no\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">\f                                                                3</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                                                9</span>\n\nprima facie case for proceeding against the accused, cases\n\npending in court also shall be deemed to have been withdrawn\n\nwith effect from the date of issuance of such direction by the\n\nReview Committee. The wording is clear and unambiguous and\n\ndoes not contemplate or provide for a further application of\n\nmind by the Public Prosecutor or grant of consent by the court\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_134\">section 321</a> Cr.P.C. We are therefore of the view that the\n\nHigh Court was not right in assuming that the decision of the\n\nMadras High Court approved by this Court with reference to\n\nsection 60(4) to (7) of POTA will apply in regard to <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_135\">section 2(3)</a>\n\nof the Repealing Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"184560188\" id=\"span_83\">30.   An apprehension was expressed that if the review\n\ncommittee reaches a wrong opinion there will be no remedy. It\n\nwas pointed out that if <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_136\">section 321</a> Cr.P.C. was applicable,\n\nthere will at least be a judicial scrutiny before the opinion\n\nresulted in withdrawal.

All that is\n      necessary for the court to see is to ensure that the\n      application for withdrawal has been properly made, after\n      independent consideration, by the Public Prosecutor and in\n      furtherance of public interest. ........ The section does not\n      insist upon a reasoned order by the Magistrate while giving\n      consent. All that is necessary to satisfy the section is to see\n      that the Public Prosecutor acts in good faith and that the\n      Magistrate is satisfied that the exercise of discretion by the\n      Public Prosecutor is proper.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">31.   The opinion of the Review Committee is open to judicial\n\nreview under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_138\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. Any person\n\naggrieved by the opinion can challenge it in a writ petition. As\n\nlong as an aggrieved person could challenge the opinion\n\nexpressed by the Review Committee                by invoking       judicial\n\nreview, the apprehension that there will be no remedy in the\n\nevent of wrong opinion by Review committee, is unwarranted.\n\nThe opinions of the Review Committee under <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_139\">section 2(3)</a> of the\n\nRepealing Act are limited in number and are required to be\n\ngiven as an one time measure with reference to a repealed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">\f                                                                4</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                                                1</span>\n\nstatute. The availability of judicial review under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_140\">Article 226</a> in\n\nthe event of errors and abuse, is a sufficient safeguard and\n\ndeterrent against any wrong doing by the Review Committee.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">32.   We therefore hold that once the Review Committee on\n\nreview under <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_141\">section 2(3)</a> of the Repealing Act, expresses the\n\nopinion that there is no prima facie case for proceeding against\n\nthe accused, in cases in which cognizance has been taken by\n\nthe Court, such cases shall be deemed to have been withdrawn.\n\nThe only role of the Public Prosecutor in the matter is to bring\n\nto the notice of the court, the direction of the Review\n\nCommittee.

The High Court of Gujarat was dealing with a POTA\n\n(Repeal) 2004 question, not POTA 2002, it sought to find\n\nlanguage that was pari materia to both statutes.      If the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">\f                                                     4</span>\n\nstatutes were effectively the same, then the Madras High\n\nCourt judgment would be relevant to the Gujarat case.\n\nMoreover, the Gujarat High Court could argue that the\n\nSupreme Court gave its imprimatur of approval.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">5.   The High Court reasoned that <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_157\">section 2(3)</a> of POTA\n\n(Repeal) 2004 is pari materia with section 60(7) read with\n\nsection 60(4) of POTA 2002. <a href=\"/doc/3644099/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 2(3)</a> of POTA (Repeal)\n\n2004 provides that where the Review Committee is of the\n\nopinion that there is no prima facie case for proceeding\n\nagainst the accused, then, in cases in which cognizance\n\nhas been taken by the Court, the cases shall be deemed to\n\nhave been withdrawn.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_78\">6.   Section 60(7) of POTA 2002 states that where any\n\nReview Committee constituted under sub-section (1) is of\n\nopinion that there is no prima facie case for proceeding\n\nagainst the accused and issues directions under sub-\n\nsection (4), then the proceedings pending against the\n\naccused shall be deemed to have been withdrawn from the\n\ndate of such direction. In the High Court&#x27;s words:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">\f&quot;though, the language of Sub-section (3) of\nSection 2 of the Repeal Act is not identical to\nthat of sub-section (4) read with sub-section (7)\nof the 2002 Act, it is substantially pari materia to\nthose provisions inasmuch as the opinion\nformed by the Review Committee on the prima-\nfacie nature of the case for not proceeding\nagainst the accused under the 2002 Act has\nbeen given primacy and virtually made\nconclusive in the scheme of both the provisions.\nThe only difference between the scheme of sub-\nsections (4) to (7) of Section 60 (as amended in\nthe year 2003) and Section 2(3) of the Repeal Act\nis that while in the former case the Review\nCommittee could initiate action on an\napplication made by an aggrieved person and\nthe direction given by it were treated binding on\nthe Central Government etc. under sub-section\n(3) of Section 2 of the Repeal Act the Review\nCommittee is required to examine all the\npending cases registered under the 2002 Act for\ndetermining whether there is a prima-facie case\nfor proceeding against the accused under the\nsaid Act. One starking similarity between the two\nsets of provisions is that once the Review\nCommittee forms an opinion that there is no\nprima-facie case for proceeding against the\naccused under the 2002 Act, the pending cases\nwere treated as automatically withdrawn.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">Therefore, keeping in view the ratio of the\njudgment of Madras High Court which has been\napproved by the Supreme Court, we are inclined\nto agree with the learned Additional Solicitor\nGeneral that the impugned provisions should be\nread in conjunction, with Section 321 of the\nCode and same do not, in any manner, encroach\nupon the judicial power of the State and that the\nopinion formed by the Review Committee on the\nprima-facie nature of the case under the 2002\nAct has to be given due weightage by the Special\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">\f                                                       4</span>\n\n     court and accepted unless there are exceptional\n     reasons for not doing so.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">                                   (emphasis added]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">7.   It appears as though the Gujarat High Court\n\nconsidered &quot;proceedings pending against the accused&quot; to\n\ninclude those proceedings in which the Special Court had\n\ntaken cognizance of the matter.        From this limited\n\ninterpretation, one can call the statutes pari materia.    It\n\nseems that the High Court correctly downplayed the\n\ndifference between the Review Committee&#x27;s having to\n\nreceive an application before taking action and the Review\n\nCommittee&#x27;s having to take action immediately and review\n\nall pending cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">8.   Ultimately, the debate over whether the statutes are\n\npari materia misses the point.   If <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_159\">section 321</a> of Cr.P.C.\n\nitself cannot apply, the issue comes for consideration is\n\nwhether or not POTA (Repeal) 2004 encroaches on the\n\njurisdiction and powers is clearly violative of the concept\n\nof the separation of powers. Here, the High Court neither\n\nprovides analysis nor support for its conclusion that\n\fjudicial review is not affected. Then again, judicial review\n\nis only slightly modified when <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_160\">section 321</a> of Cr.P.C. has\n\nbeen read into POTA Repeal 2004, as the High Court did.\n\nThat is likely why the High Court chose not to analyze the\n\nquestion from a judicial review standpoint.    The Special\n\nCourt still gets the last word, but it now has to give the\n\nReview Committee&#x27;s decision &quot;due weightage&quot; or it must\n\naccept the Review Committee&#x27;s opinion &quot;unless there are\n\nexceptional reasons for not doing so.&quot; Of course, it is the\n\npublic prosecutor who is most affected by the Gujarat\n\nHigh Court&#x27;s Scheme. He no longer chooses whether to file\n\nan application for withdrawal or not.          The Review\n\nCommittee can compel him to do so. This is at odds with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_161\">section 321</a> of Cr.P.C.   That said, it may have been the\n\nHigh Court&#x27;s attempt at harmoniously interpreting two\n\ncompeting statutes. The High Court while concluding\n\nobserved thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1564949\" id=\"span_98\">&quot;....once the Review Committee, after hearing the\n     concerned parties and perusing the relevant\n     records/material forms an opinion that no prima\n     facie case is made out for proceeding against the\n     accused under the 2002 Act, the Public\n     Prosecutor appointed under <a href=\"/doc/18231827/\" id=\"a_162\">Section 28</a> of the\n     Act will have to file appropriate application\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">\f                                                           5</span>\n\n     under Section 321 of the Code without any delay\n     and the Special Court will be required to pass\n     appropriate order giving due weightage to the\n     opinion of the Review Committee and keeping in\n     view the observations made by the (1996) 2 SCC\n     610 and Shaheen Welfare Association Supreme\n     Court in <a href=\"/doc/1564949/\" id=\"a_163\">R.M.

This case does not apply\n\nto the present dispute because the Court was not dealing\n\nwith POTA (Repeal) 2004, whose text expressly states that\n\nthe Committee can deem a case withdrawn. Instead, the\n\ncase was interpreting the State Review Committee&#x27;s\n\finterpretation of Kartar Singh&#x27;s    directions, which are\n\nambiguous as to whether <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_169\">section 321</a> of Cr.P.C. should\n\napply to the Committee(s) it spawned.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">10. The Madras High Court took a similar stand but\n\nmore closely adhered to the case law that has interpreted\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_170\">section 321</a> of Cr.P.C. by retaining the public prosecutor&#x27;s\n\nability to make an independent decision. The High Court\n\nobserved thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">    &quot;The words in sub-section (7) of Section 60 of\n    POTA, `the proceedings pending against the\n    accused shall be deemed to have been\n    withdrawn from the date of such direction&#x27; shall\n    have to be understood only in the context of\n    <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_171\">Section 321</a> of Code of Criminal Procedure to\n    mean that if the Review Committee forms an\n    opinion that the prosecution under POTA\n    against the accused respondents does not\n    attract the provisions of POTA, appropriate\n    directions can be issued to the State\n    Government and if the directions are in the\n    nature of addressing the Public Prosecutor to\n    withdraw the prosecution, then such a direction\n    is binding on the State Government.

Before turning to the Supreme Court&#x27;s brief order in\n\nwhich it upheld this case, I must examine the Madras\n\nHigh Court&#x27;s reasoning with regard to the issue of\n\nencroachment on judicial power in violation of separation\n\nof powers. The Madras High Court assumes that <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_174\">section\n\n321</a> of Cr.P.C. applies to POTA.   No detailed analysis is\n\nprovided - <a href=\"/doc/1329373/\" id=\"a_175\">sections 4</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1007660/\" id=\"a_176\">5</a> of Cr.P.C. are not raised; nor\n\nis the question as to why Parliament would require two\n\nreviews. If I were to assume that <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_177\">section 321</a> of Cr.P.C.\n\napplies, the question of interference with the judiciary\n\nbecomes moot.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">12. It has become imperative to deal the aspect of\n\nremoval of judicial review on basic structure of the\n\nConstitution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">DOES REMOVAL OF JUDICIAL REVIEW, WHICH IS THE\nCONCEPT BEHIND SECTION 321 <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_178\">Cr.P.C</a>., VIOLATE\nTHE BASIC STRUCTURE?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">\f13. While <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_179\">section 321</a> of Cr.P.C. itself does not apply, the\n\nprinciple of judicial review embodied therein does.        In\n\nother words, <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_180\">section 321</a> of Cr.P.C. is a codified version of\n\njudicial review.   At the trial court level, <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_181\">section 321</a> of\n\nCr.P.C. ensures that the judiciary makes the final decision\n\nby approving the public prosecutor&#x27;s decision to withdraw\n\na case. Even if <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_182\">section 321</a> of Cr.P.C. is made inapplicable\n\nby a special law like POTA (Repeal) 2004 or POTA 2002,\n\njudicial review still applies.   <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_183\">Section 321</a> of Cr.P.C. is a\n\ngeneral provision that can be subjected to special laws.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_92\">14. On the other hand, judicial review should not suffer\n\nthe same fate. A violation of judicial review is another way\n\nof saying that the separation of powers between the\n\nprincipal three organs of the State have been violated.\n\nJudicial review forms part of the basic structure of the\n\nConstitution. And when judicial review is removed - even\n\nat the trial court level - the question becomes one of\n\ndegree : has the basic structure been destroyed?        Our\n\nshort answer is that because POTA (Repeal) 2004 has not\n\nremoved judicial review under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_184\">Article 226</a> or <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_185\">Article 136</a>,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">\f                                                          5</span>\n\nthe basic structure has not been destroyed.        Given the\n\ngravity of this question, I deem it necessary to explain my\n\nreasoning.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_94\">15.

This is because in the matter concerning\n\njudiciary, it should have the final say over cases that have\n\nbeen placed before it.    It goes without saying that the\n\nCourt&#x27;s decision to grant consent to an application for\n\nwithdrawal is a judicial function.   If it is granted, the case\n\nis over. Resolving legal disputes is the core function of the\n\njudiciary. The power to take a final decision once a case is\n\nbefore a Court, irrespective of the stage at which the\n\ndetermination is made, should rest with the judge. To the\n\nextent POTA (Repeal) 2004 takes this decision away from\n\nthe judge, it implicates the basic structure doctrine.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_95\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"726197\" id=\"span_105\">16.

That is why the cases\n\nanalyzing <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_189\">section 321</a> of Cr.P.C. are illustrative of the\n\nimportance of judicial review, but they are not on point.\n\nFor example, in the <a href=\"/doc/726197/\" id=\"a_190\">State of Bihar v.

The section\n    gives no indication as to the grounds on which\n    the Public Prosecutor may make the application,\n    or the considerations on which the Court is to\n    grant its consent. There can be no doubt,\n    however, that the resultant order, on the\n    granting of the consent, being an order of\n    &#x27;discharge&#x27; or &#x27;acquittal&#x27;, would attract the\n    applicability of correction by the High Court\n    under ss. 435, 436 and 439 or 417 of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_191\">Code\n    of Criminal Procedure</a>.

The Court struck 329A(4), holding it in violation of\n\nthe basic structure.       <a href=\"/doc/1797219/\" id=\"a_216\">Article 329(A)(4)</a> appropriated the\n\fCourt&#x27;s power to adjudicate election laws, encroaching on\n\nthe judiciary in violation of separation of powers.       In\n\nvoiding this part of the 39th Amendment, the Court\n\ndeclared that separation of powers and judicial review (by\n\nnecessary implication) are part of the basic structure\n\nbecause of the retrospective effect of the Election Laws\n\n(Amendment) Act, 40 of 1975.      I turn to a number of\n\nrelevant passages for further guidance:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">    &quot;Para 60: (Ray, C.J.) It is true that no express\n    mention is made in our Constitution of vesting\n    in the judiciary the judicial power as is to be\n    found in the American Constitution. But a\n    division of the three main functions of\n    Government is recognised in our Constitution.\n    Judicial power in the sense of the judicial power\n    of the State is vested in the Judiciary. Similarly,\n    the Executive and the Legislature are vested\n    with powers in their spheres. Judicial power has\n    lain in the hands of the Judiciary prior to the\n    Constitution and also since the Constitution. It\n    is not the intention that the powers of the\n    Judiciary should be passed to or be shared by\n    the Executive or the Legislature or that the\n    powers of the Legislature or the Executive\n    should pass to or be shared by the Judiciary.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">    Para 64: (Ray, C.J.) &quot;Clause 5 in <a href=\"/doc/190157089/\" id=\"a_217\">Article 329-A</a>\n    states that an appeal against any order of any\n    court referred to in Clause 4 pending, before the\n    commencement of the <a href=\"/doc/36314713/\" id=\"a_218\">Constitution (Thirty-ninth\n    Amendment) Act, 1975</a>, before the Supreme\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">\f                                                        6</span>\n\n    Court, shall be disposed of in conformity with\n    the provisions of Clause 4. The appeal cannot be\n    disposed of in conformity with the provisions of\n    Clause 4 inasmuch as the validation of the\n    election cannot rest on Clause 4.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_116\">26. I note that the very fact that the Court did not\n\ndispose of the appeal by writing a summary order citing to\n\nClause 5 shows that the Court dismissed outright the\n\nParliament&#x27;s attempt to remove a pending appeal from the\n\nCourt&#x27;s   purview.       By    holding   <a href=\"/doc/1797219/\" id=\"a_219\">Article   329(A)(4)</a>\n\nunconstitutional, Clause (5) became      moot.      Justice\n\nChandrachud, as he then was, recognized this technical\n\npoint and held both Clauses (4) and (5) unconstitutional.\n\nThe others did not seem it necessary to deal with Clause\n\n(5). [see Khanna, J. at para 185]\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_117\">27. At    para   688,   Justice     Chandrachud     further\n\nexpounded the doctrine of separation of powers:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">         &quot;I do not suggest that such an encroaching\n    power will be pursued relentlessly or ruthlessly\n    by our Parliament. But no Constitution can\n    survive without a conscious adherence to its fine\n    checks and balances. Just as Court ought not to\n    enter into problems entwined in the &quot;political\n\f    thicket&quot;, Parliament must also respect the\n    preserve of the courts. The principle of\n    separation of powers is a principle of restraint\n    which &quot;has in it the precept, innate in the\n    prudence of self-preservation (even if history has\n    not repeatedly brought it home), that discretion\n    is the better part of valour&quot; Social Dimensions of\n    Law and Justice-Julius Stone (1966). p. 668.]\n    Courts have, by and large, come to check their\n    valorous propensities. In the name of the\n    Constitution, the Parliament may not also turn\n    its attention from the important task of\n    legislation to deciding court cases for which it\n    lacks the expertise and the apparatus. If it\n    gathers facts, it gathers facts of policy. If it\n    records findings, it does so without a pleading\n    and without framing any issues. And worst of\n    all, if it decides a Court case, it decides without\n    hearing the parties and in defiance of the\n    fundamental principles of natural justice.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_118\">28. This raises the issue of the Review Committee&#x27;s\n\ncompetence to decide the court case.        Even a ruling\n\nwherein prima facie cases are withdrawn, the decision to\n\nwithdraw is final and terminates the case in favour of the\n\naccused.    A case has thus been decided.     The question\n\nregarding   the   Committee&#x27;s   competence     loses   some\n\nrelevance when I consider that the aggrieved party could\n\nstill file an appeal against such a decision. Nevertheless,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">\f                                                            6</span>\n\nthe Review Committee is an executive body that is making\n\na judicial decision.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_119\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_120\">29. The Executive appoints the Review Committee.                A\n\nmajority of its members belong to the Executive Branch.\n\nUnder   POTA      (Repeal)   2004,    the   Executive&#x27;s   Review\n\nCommittee has the power to decide cases. Thus, judicial\n\nreview has been implicated.          Given that judicial review\n\nforms part of the basic structure, it is our job to determine\n\nif POTA (Repeal) 2004 has gone too far.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_121\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\">30. In order to reach its decision, the Review Committee\n\ncan conduct discovery. It has the power to compel parties\n\nto produce any document. In addition, it can requisition\n\nany public record pursuant to <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_220\">the Code of Civil Procedure</a>,\n\n1908.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_123\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_124\">31. Despite its access to the relevant information, it is\n\nnot a court and could be more easily swayed by political\n\nconsiderations.    Owing allegiance to the Executive, the\n\nReview Committee could be tempted to decide the outcome\n\fof a case based on that which is politically expedience.\n\nAfter all, it is an Executive body that is performing a\n\npurely judicial decision. At para 689 (Chandrachud, J. as\n\nhe then was) observed that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">     &quot;...The &quot;separation of powers does not mean the\n     equal balance of powers&quot;. says Harold Laski, but\n     the exercise by the legislature of what is purely\n     and indubitably a judicial function is impossible\n     to sustain in the context even of our co-operative\n     federalism which contains no rigid distribution\n     of powers but which provides a system of\n     salutary checks and balances.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_125\">32. Ultimately, at para 696, Justice Chandrachud held:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">&quot;...that   clauses   (4)   and   (5)   of   <a href=\"/doc/190157089/\" id=\"a_221\">Article   329A</a>   are\n\nunconstitutional and therefore void....&quot;       Justice Khanna\n\nat para 213 finds 329A(4) to violate the principle of free\n\nand fair elections.

Under one\n\nreading of the statute, withdrawal occurs on the spot.\n\nUnder the other, it is to languish before the public\n\nprosecutor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_154\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">51. If the public prosecutor approves of the decision to\n\nwithdraw, then it is presented to the Special Court for a\n\nfinal decision. Inserting <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_275\">section 321</a> of Cr.P.C. itself into\n\fPOTA (Repeal) 2004 defies logic and produces an absurd\n\nresult. &quot;The object of the construction of a statute being\n\nto ascertain the will of the Legislature, it may be presumed\n\nthat neither injustice nor absurdity was intended.&quot; (Owen\n\nThomas Mangin v. Inland Revenue Commissioner,\n\n[1971) 2 WLR 39, p. 42 (PC) (Lord Donovan), as referred in\n\nJustice   G.P.    Singh&#x27;s     celebrated   book,    Principles    of\n\nStatutory Interpretation, 11th Edition, 2008 at page 129.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_156\">52. The appellant further argued that requiring two\n\nwithdrawals      disregards     Parliamentary      intent.       The\n\nStatute&#x27;s Statement of Objects and Reasons expresses the\n\nParliament&#x27;s intent. It reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">     &quot;The provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1778/\" id=\"a_276\">Terrorism Act, 2002</a> was\n     enacted as a Special law to deal with terrorist\n     acts.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">          2. There have been allegations of gross\n     misuse of the provisions of the Act by some\n     State Governments. Views have been expressed\n     that provisions of the Act were misused in cases\n     where they should not have been invoked. It has\n     also been observed in various quarters that the\n     Act has failed to serve its intended purpose and\n     as a result, there have been persistent demands\n     that this At should be repealed.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">\f                                                        8</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">         3. The Government has concerned with\n    the manner in which provisions of the Act were\n    grossly misused in the past two years. It was,\n    therefore, felt necessary to repeal the Act. As\n    Parliament was not in session, the Prevention of\n    Terrorism (Repeal) Ordinance, 2004 was\n    promulgated on 21-9.2004.         The Ordinance\n    empowers the Central Review Committee to\n    review all cases pending in the courts or at\n    various stages of investigation and complete the\n    review within the period of one year from the\n    date of repeal of the Act and to give its\n    directions. Whenever, in the opinion of the\n    Central Review Committee no prima facie case is\n    made out either in respect of cases pending in\n    the courts, or under investigation, such cases\n    shall be deemed to have been withdrawn and\n    investigation closed, as the case may be.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">         4.   The Prevention of Terrorism (Repeal)\n              Bill, 2004 seeks to replace the\n              Prevention   of  Terrorism  (Repeal)\n              Ordinance, 2004 and to achieve the\n              above objects.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">                                         Sd/-\n</blockquote><pre id=\"pre_2\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"105707439\" id=\"span_144\"><a href=\"/doc/105707439/\" id=\"a_277\">New Delhi                              Shivraj\n    V.

This Bill became the POTA (Repeal) Act 2004, out of\n\nwhich the instant case arises.    This statement gives us\n\nguidance in two areas.   First, the allegations of misuse of\n\nPOTA   2002   were   directed    at   some   of   the   State\n\nGovernments. This is relevant because it shows that the\n\fParliament wanted a mechanism by which it could reverse\n\nthe State Governments&#x27; alleged misuse of POTA 2002.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">Subjecting the Central Review Committee&#x27;s decision to the\n\nwill of the State Government&#x27;s Public Prosecutor, as is\n\ndone when <a href=\"/doc/1037589/\" id=\"a_278\">section 321</a> of Cr.P.C. applies, clearly goes\n\nagainst the very objective of POTA (Repeal) 2004.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">54. It is reiterated that those aggrieved by the Review\n\nCommittee&#x27;s decision are not without any remedy, they\n\ncan have recourse under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_279\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">In this view of the matter, the basic principle of separation\n\nof power is not violated. No provisions of the Constitution\n\nare violated by repealing the Act by the Parliament.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">55. I agree with the conclusions arrived at by Hon&#x27;ble the\n\nChief Justice. The appeals are accordingly disposed of.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_90\">                                     ...............................J.\n                                    (Dalveer Bhandari)\nNew Delhi;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">October 21, 2008\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_145\">\f8</span>\n\f</blockquote>","numcites":78,"numcitedby":30,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":342033,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"\"separation of powers\"","formInput":"%22separation%20of%20powers%22"},{"value":"criminal review","formInput":"criminal%20review"},{"value":"withdrawal of prosecution","formInput":"withdrawal%20of%20prosecution"},{"value":"321 crpc","formInput":"321%20crpc"},{"value":"kesavananda bharati","formInput":"kesavananda%20bharati"},{"value":"section 321 crpc","formInput":"section%20321%20crpc"},{"value":"article 32","formInput":"article%2032"},{"value":"judicial review","formInput":"judicial%20review"},{"value":"pota review committee","formInput":"pota%20review%20committee"},{"value":"separation of powers","formInput":"separation%20of%20powers"},{"value":"review procedural","formInput":"review%20procedural"},{"value":"constitutional validity","formInput":"constitutional%20validity"},{"value":"section 321 of Cr.P.C","formInput":"section%20321%20of%20Cr.P.C"},{"value":"321 cr.p.c.","formInput":"321%20cr.p.c."},{"value":"encroachment as is where is","formInput":"encroachment%20as%20is%20where%20is"},{"value":"prevention of terrorism act","formInput":"prevention%20of%20terrorism%20act"},{"value":"review by same court","formInput":"review%20by%20same%20court"},{"value":"basic structure doctrine","formInput":"basic%20structure%20doctrine"},{"value":"no saving clause ","formInput":"no%20saving%20clause%20"},{"value":"section 321","formInput":"section%20321"}],"cats":[{"value":"criminal-procedure-code","formInput":"tag:criminal-procedure-code"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
