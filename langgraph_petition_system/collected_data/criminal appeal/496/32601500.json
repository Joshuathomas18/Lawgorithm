No.1 of 2019 in\n\nAppeal No.1295 of 2019 and Mr. Gharat, Special Public Prosecutor for\n\nC.B.I and Ms. Tidke, A.P.P, for State.\n\n\n\n4.             The applicants are said to be the members of an Organized\n\nCrime Syndicate of Chhota Rajan. It is submitted that there is no evidence,\n\nmuch less, believable evidence whether the weapon used was a pistol or\n\nrevolver. Learned Counsel for the applicants took me through the evidence\n\nof prosecution witnesses. It is contended that almost all the confessions of\n\nthe applicants are copies of each other including the errors and stereotyped\n\nrecord which creates doubt as to the authenticity and genuineness of the\n\nconfession recorded by the concerned D.C.Ps.              It is contended that no\n\nmaterial is produced by which it can be said that the applicants were\n\nproduced before the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate as well as there is no\n\nevidence establishing the identity of the assailants.\n\n\n5.             So far as applicant-Talvinder Singh Gurubacchan Singh Bakshi\n\n@ Sonu is concerned, no description has been given of the applicant by the\n\nidentifying witness. C.C.T.V footage produced on record is sans a certificate\n\nrequired under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_12\">section 65B</a> of the Indian Evidence Act, 1872 (for short\n\n&#x27;<a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_13\">Evidence Act</a>&#x27;). The prosecution has failed to establish the exact spot of the\n\nincident, as different witnesses have shown different spots, more\n\n\n\n                                                                                            4/10\n\n\n\n     ::: Uploaded on - 14/02/2020                       ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2020 15:36:43 :::\n                                              criminal appeal No.1201-2019 with companion appeals.doc\n\n\n\n\nparticularly, the injured was not taken to the spot even after his discharge\n\nfrom the Hospital.\n\n\n6.              The prosecution has not even proved an F.I.R through the\n\nvictim i.e P.W.28-B.R. Shetty which came to be proved through the\n\nInvestigating Officer. The most important aspect of the case is that the\n\nprosecution has not established motive behind the offence.\n\n\n7.              Owner of the Motorcycle alleged to have been used in the\n\noffence has not been examined. P.W.34- D.C.P Dhananjay Kulkarni is said\n\nto have been admitted the repeated mistakes in the confessional statements.\n\nThe prosecution has failed to recover weapon of the offence which is said to\n\nhave been thrown in Vashi Creek.        Even the testimony of P.W.37- Mr.\n\nNarkar Naib Tahesildar suffers from several discrepancies.                         So far as\n\napplicant No.4 is concerned, it is contended that the evidence against this\n\napplicant-accused is shaky and incredible.\n\n\n\n8.             As already stated, there is no discovery of weapon from Vashi\n\ncreek by the Police, in the sense, Panchanama under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_14\">section 27</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act has not been established.          There is remote possibility of\n\nidentifying the assailant/s in the rear view mirror of the car during night\n\nhours. The sanction for prosecution given by P.W.41-Dr. Satyapal Singh\n\nalso suffers from irregularities.\n\n                                                                                             5/10\n\n\n\n     ::: Uploaded on - 14/02/2020                        ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2020 15:36:43 :::\n                                               criminal appeal No.1201-2019 with companion appeals.doc\n\n\n\n\n9.              On the other hand, the learned A.P.P objected the release of the\n\napplicants, pending the appeal on the ground that even if no weapon has\n\nbeen seized, there is no reason to disbelieve the informant P.W.28-B.R.\n\nShetty as regards fire opened by A4 and A5 in the light of the fact that the\n\ninformant had given description of the assailant.                 He submits that the\n\nreasoning rendered by the trial Court cannot be falsified at this stage or can\n\nbe negated. There is strong unrebuttable evidence, according to the learned\n\nA.P.P, which is in the form of CDR indicating presence of applicants in the\n\nvicinity where the offence had occurred. The applicants had seen the poster\n\nof the victim and that is how they could ascertain his identity, meaning\n\nthereby, they did reconnaissance.\n\n\n10.             It was the case of the contract killing at the behest of Gangster\n\nChhota Rajan. Merely because there are certain similarities in the first part\n\nof the confessional statement does not mean that the statements are copies\n\nof each other. Rather, according to the learned A.P.P, there is consistency in\n\nall the confessional statements which are well corroborated with each other.\n\nAccording to the learned A.P.P, part (I) of the confession is a format\n\ncommonly used and, therefore, there might be certain similarities in the\n\nmistakes/errors but that would not go to the root of the prosecution case.\n\n\n11.             Having heard the respective Counsel for the applicants as well\n\nas the learned A.P.P, without going into the merits, it is pertinent to note that\n\n                                                                                              6/10\n\n\n\n      ::: Uploaded on - 14/02/2020                        ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2020 15:36:43 :::\n                                             criminal appeal No.1201-2019 with companion appeals.doc\n\n\n\n\nthe applicants have already undergone more than six years of incarceration\n\nin Jail. Those being appeals of 2019 and looking to the pendency of the old\n\nappeals on the file of this Court, it is quite unlikely that the present appeals\n\nwould be taken up for final disposal in near future.\n\n\n12.             The applicant No.1 came to be arrested on 20th October, 2012\n\nand applicant No.2 came to be arrested on 23rd October, 2012. Applicant\n\nNo.3 came to be arrested on 26th November, 2012.\n\n\n13.             Maximum sentence awarded by the trial Court in view of the\n\nimpugned judgment and order of conviction is 8 years. The applicants have\n\nalready undergone substantial part of the substantive sentence. The Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court in the case of Kiran Kumar Vs. State of M.P, (2001) 9\n\nSupreme Court Cases 211 made it clear that it is the normal rule that when\n\nthe appeal of a person convicted and sentenced is pending, the sentence\n\npassed on him should be suspended unless any exceptional reason recorded\n\nin the impugned order and, therefore, the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court suspended\n\nthe sentence and directed the release of the applicant on bail. The Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court while dealing with <a href=\"/doc/985477/\" id=\"a_15\">sections 389</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1903086/\" id=\"a_16\">374</a> of the Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure took into consideration it&#x27;s judgment in the case of\n\nBhagwan Rama Shinde Gosavi Vs. State of Gujarat, (1999) 4 Supreme\n\nCourt Cases 421 wherein it has been observed that when a person is\n\nconvicted and sentenced to a short-term imprisonment, can be released on\n\n                                                                                            7/10\n\n\n\n      ::: Uploaded on - 14/02/2020                      ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2020 15:36:43 :::\n                                                  criminal appeal No.1201-2019 with companion appeals.doc\n\n\n\n\nbail as a normal rule when the appeal is pending. The sentence should be\n\nsuspended and it&#x27;s rejection should be only by way of exception. In such\n\ncases, every endeavour should be made to have the appeal posted for early\n\nhearing and disposal.            It is observed that if the short-term sentence is\n\nallowed to run out during the pendency of the appeal, the appeal itself will\n\nbecome, for all practical purposes, infructuous so far as the appellant is\n\nconcerned.\n\n                                                             (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n14.             Learned Counsel for the applicants have drawn my attention to\n\nan order passed by this Court (Coram: Dama Seshadri Naidu, J.) in\n\nCriminal Application No.591 of 2019 in Criminal Appeal No.136 of 2019\n\nwherein similar view has been echoed by the learned Single Judge. My\n\nattention is also drawn to a judgment of the Division Bench of this Court in\n\nCriminal Application No.1312 of 2018 in Criminal Appeal No.934 of 2018\n\ndated 20th February, 2020 (Coram: A.S. Oka and A.S.
