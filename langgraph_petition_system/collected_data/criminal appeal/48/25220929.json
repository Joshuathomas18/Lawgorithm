Ramesh Jain left his rice mill at 9:30 pm on 25.12.2005.\n\nHis dead body was exhumed from the premises of the temple\n\nin    village   Kheri    Khusnam    on       the    intervening     night   of\n\n22/23.01.2006. The post mortem examination was conducted\n\nby Dr. Pankaj Jain (PW16) on 23.01.2006. He deposed that the\n\nprocess of decomposition was in progress.                       The skin was\n\npeeled off at most places.         A muffler was present around the\n\nneck of the dead body. Both wrists and ankles were tied by a\n\npiece of cloth.     The hyoid bone was found fractured. In the\n\nopinion of PW 16, Ramesh Jain died of asphyxia. The probable\n\ntime of death, according to him, was 3/4 weeks prior to\n\n23.01.2006.         He    also   deposed           that   the    process    of\n\ndecomposition would be slower during winter.                      Dinesh Jain\n\n(PW1) deposed that there was a demand of ransom of Rs.1\n\ncrore for the release of his father which was made through a\n\ntelephone call on 06.01.2006 from a person who identified\n\nhimself as Bunty and who was speaking in Bihari dialect. He\n\nalso spoke of the calls that were made from the mobile phone\n\nbearing No. 9896351091 belonging to his father on 08.01.2006\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                         8</span>\n\fand 09.01.2006 by which the ransom demands were repeated.\n\nHe further stated about the threatening letters received by him\n\nat his shop address.

The arrest of A1 to A3 from Tibetan Market, Delhi at 11:45\n\npm on 20.01.2006 led to several disclosure statements made\n\nby the accused pursuant to which relevant material was\n\nrecovered. The details of recoveries made from each of the\n\naccused will be discussed later.         The dead body of the\n\ndeceased Ramesh Jain was also recovered pursuant to a\n\ndisclosure statement made by A2 to A4. The CDRs that were\n\nobtained from the Nodal officers of the telephone companies\n\nwhich were exhibited in the Court without objection clearly\n\nprove the complicity of all the accused.

Thus the principles governing interference by this\n     Court in a criminal appeal by special leave may be\n     summarised as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">          “(1) that this Court would not interfere with the\n          concurrent finding of fact based on pure\n          appreciation of evidence even if it were to take a\n          different view on the evidence;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">          (2) that the Court will not normally enter into a\n          re-appraisement or review of the evidence,\n          unless the assessment of the High Court is\n          vitiated by an error of law or procedure or is\n          based on error of record, misreading of evidence\n          or is inconsistent with the evidence, for instance,\n          where the ocular evidence is totally inconsistent\n          with the medical evidence and so on;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">          (3) that the Court would not enter into credibility\n          of the evidence with a view to substitute its own\n          opinion for that of the High Court;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">          (4) that the Court would interfere where the High\n          Court has arrived at a finding of fact in disregard\n          of a judicial process, principles of natural justice\n          or a fair hearing or has acted in violation of a\n          mandatory provision of law or procedure\n          resulting in serious prejudice or injustice to the\n          accused;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">          (5) this Court might also interfere where on the\n          proved facts wrong inferences of law have been\n          drawn or where the conclusions of the High Court\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                    10</span>\n\f             are manifestly   perverse     and    based   on    no\n             evidence.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">15.

The circumstances should be of a definite tendency\n             unerringly pointing towards the guilt of the accused.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      3.     The circumstances taken cumulatively must form a\n             chain so complete that there is no escape from the\n             conclusion that within all human probability, the\n             crime was committed by the accused and none else.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      4.     The circumstantial evidence in order to sustain\n             conviction must be complete and incapable of\n             explanation of any other hypothesis than that of the\n             guilt of the accused and such evidence should not\n             only be consistent with the guilt of the accused but\n             should be inconsistent with his innocence.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"13149785\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"882637\" id=\"span_19\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"112173291\" id=\"span_20\">(See: <a href=\"/doc/112173291/\" id=\"a_8\">Shanti Devi v.

The deceased was missing from 23.12.2005 and\n             his dead body was dug out from the premises of a\n             temple on 23.01.2006.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">           B.

Disclosure statements made by the accused\n            pursuant to which there was recovery of several\n            articles belonging to the deceased including the\n            SIM card of his mobile number, wallet containing\n            his personal belongings, etc.\n\n       E. The CDRs of the mobile which clearly show the\n            interaction of the accused during the period from\n            25.12.2005 to 20.01.2006 as well as the calls\n            made to PW1 including the calls made from the\n            mobile phone of the deceased.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">       F.

The registration\n\ncertificate was recovered from the drawer of a table lying in the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                         12</span>\n\froom of his house situated at Begha Road, Ganaur.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">19.      Mr. D. B. Goswami, learned counsel appearing for A1\n\nsubmitted that A1 and A4 are brothers.         A4 and A2 were\n\npartners in transport business.      He submitted that A1 was\n\narrested from his house in his village Ghasoli, District Sonepat.\n\nHe relied upon the evidence of DW 2 and DW 5 in support\n\nthereof.     DW2 and DW 5 who are residents of village Ghasoli\n\ndeposed that police personnel visited the village around 9 am\n\nin search of Parveen (A4) on 20.01.2006. They stated that A1\n\naccompanied the police to the police station. He travelled in\n\nhis own car and the police went in the Govt. Jeep. On the other\n\nhand, the case of the prosecution is that A1 was arrested along\n\nwith A2 and A3 at 11:45 PM on 20.01.2006 at Tibetan Market,\n\nDelhi.     The police from Rohini Police Station, Delhi were also\n\ninvolved in the raid pursuant to which A1 was arrested.      The\n\ninterested     testimonies of DW2 and DW5 do          not merit\n\nacceptance, especially when the prosecution has proved the\n\narrest and the subsequent recoveries made pursuant to the\n\ndisclosure statement of A1.      The learned counsel submitted\n\nthat the application filed by A1 to take his voice sample was\n\nrejected by the Trial Court and so he cannot be found fault with\n\nfor not giving his voice sample.     A1 refused to give his voice\n\nsample when the prosecution moved the Court. Thereafter, A1\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                   13</span>\n\ffiled an application to take his voice sample and the said\n\napplication was disposed of by the Trial Court giving liberty to\n\nA1 to file again after the prosecution evidence was completed.\n\nTherefore, the learned counsel for A1 is wrong in contending\n\nthat his application for giving voice samples was rejected by\n\nthe Court.   The learned counsel further submitted that the\n\nCDRs of the mobile phone of A1 would suggest that he was\n\nmaking calls only to A2, A3 and A4. He made an attempt to\n\njustify the calls on the ground that A4 was his brother and A2\n\nwas his brother’s partner. No justification has been given for\n\nthe 28 calls between him and A3 who is from Bihar and who\n\nwas making the calls demanding a ransom of Rs.1 crore from\n\nPW 1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">A2 - Surender (Criminal Appeal No.1652 of 2014)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">20.   A2 was arrested on 20.01.2006 in Tibetan Market, Delhi\n\nalong with A1 and A3 and was found to be in possession of a\n\nmobile phone bearing No.9813091701 which was used by him\n\nfor conversing with A1, A3 and A4 between 25.12.2005 to\n\n20.01.2006. Three STD booth receipts Exh.P41, P42 and P43\n\nwere recovered from A2.     These receipts showed calls being\n\nmade to mobile No. 9896001906 which belongs to A5 Sonu. He\n\nwas a resident of Jhinjhana village and the calls made from the\n\nSTD booth with telephone No. 01398257974 pertain to\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                 14</span>\n\fJhinjhana. An amount of Rs.20,000/- was also recovered from\n\nhim at the time of his arrest. The said amount was supposed to\n\nhave been given to him by A5 Sonu. Pursuant to his disclosure\n\nstatement Exh.PCC A2 led the police party to his rented\n\naccommodation at Begha Road, Ganaur and a country made\n\npistol with two live cartridges .315 bore were recovered in the\n\npresence of PW5 Mohan Lal.       He also identified the place of\n\nabduction of Ramesh Jain at Ganaur and the place where the\n\ndead body was buried at Baba Rude Nath temple in village\n\nKheri Khusnam.     Mr. Ram Lal Roy, learned counsel for A2\n\ndoubted   the   recovery   of   the        country   made    pistol   and\n\ncartridges.   He submitted that the dead body recovered on\n\n22.01.2006 is that of a priest and not of Ramesh Jain. There is\n\nno foundation laid by the defence in support of this contention.\n\nThere is nothing on record to prove that the dead body is that\n\nof a priest. We are of the opinion that the dead body is that of\n\nRamesh Jain as identified by his relatives.                 The medical\n\nevidence shows that the skin was peeled off at several places\n\nbut the features of the body could easily be made out. PW 16\n\nalso deposed that decomposition is slow in winter months. We\n\nhave perused the photograph of Ramesh Jain and compared it\n\nwith a photograph of the dead body recovered.                   We are\n\nconvinced that the body recovered is that of the deceased\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                      15</span>\n\fRamesh Jain.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_27\">A4 - Parveen @ Titu (Criminal Appeal No.1653 of 2014)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_28\">21.   The STD booth receipt Exh. P44 showing a call made from\n\nSTD booth having No. 01398257974 from Shamli village in\n\nUttar Pradesh was recovered from A4 at the time of his arrest\n\non 22.01.2006. As per the receipt, a call was made to mobile\n\nNo.9896001906 which belongs to Sonu (A5). Pursuant to the\n\ndisclosure statement made by him, he identified the place at\n\nvillage Bai crossing on GT Road where he kept the key ring of\n\nmotor cycle, silver ring belonging to deceased Ramesh Jain and\n\nthe threatening letters.       A golden ring of the deceased was\n\nalso recovered from his residential house at village Ghasoli. He\n\nalso made a disclosure statement which led the police to the\n\nplace where the deceased was wrongfully confined.          His SIM\n\ncard with mobile No. 9812016269 was seized from his\n\nresidential house.       There is sufficient evidence on record to\n\nsuggest that he was in constant touch with the other accused.\n\nHis mobile phone and the recoveries that were made pursuant\n\nto    the   disclosure    statement    would   clearly   prove   his\n\ninvolvement in the crime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">A5 - Sonu (Criminal Appeal No.1418 of 2013)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">22.   Mr. Sidharth Luthra, learned Senior Counsel appearing for\n\nA5 submitted that it is highly improbable that A5 was arrested\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                      16</span>\n\fat a bus stop at Ganaur Chowk, GT Road, Ganaur. According to\n\nhim, A5 was arrested on 20.01.2006 at 10:15(30) pm from his\n\nhouse.   He relied upon the evidence of DW5 and DW8.       We do\n\nnot find any substance in the submission that A5 was arrested\n\non 20.01.2006 itself as it is clear from the testimony of DW8\n\nthat no complaint was made regarding the forcible arrest of A5\n\non 20.01.2006.   A disclosure statement was made by A5 which\n\nwas marked as Exh.PBB pursuant to which there was a\n\nrecovery of the wallet belonging to the deceased from the shop\n\nof A5. A laminated PAN card, one passport size photograph of\n\nthe deceased, three electricity bills, two water bills and a small\n\ndiary of Jain Mantras bearing title ‘Aanu Purvi’ were recovered\n\nfrom underneath the seat of his Aarat shop at Ganaur Mandi.\n\nThe STD booth receipts which were recovered from A2\n\nSurender and A4 Parveen at the time of their arrest show that\n\nthey made calls on the mobile No.9896001906 belonging to A5\n\non 29th and 30th December, 2005. A5 also received a call from\n\nan STD booth in Patna on 06.01.2006. Pursuant to a disclosure\n\nstatement made by him an Indica car bearing No. DL-3CW-2447\n\nwhich was used in the abduction was seized. The recoveries\n\nmade pursuant to the disclosure statements of A5 cannot be\n\nrelied upon, according to Mr. Luthra.     He referred to the six\n\ndisclosure statements made by A5 between 22.01.2006 and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                  17</span>\n\f04.02.2006. He commented upon the improbability of recovery\n\nof the wallet from underneath his seat at his shop.              He also\n\nsubmitted that the recovery is from a public place accessible to\n\neverybody and so the recoveries made cannot be relied upon.\n\nWe disagree with Mr. Luthra as the recovery of the wallet from\n\nunderneath his seat is something which is to his exclusive\n\nknowledge though other people might have access to his shop.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1769219\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"187283766\" id=\"span_29\">23.

It may\n      be that the certificate containing the details in sub-section\n      (4) of Section 65-B is not filed in the instant case, but that\n      does not mean that secondary evidence cannot be given\n      even if the law permits such evidence to be given in the\n      circumstances mentioned in the relevant provisions,\n      namely, <a href=\"/doc/1456410/\" id=\"a_19\">Sections 63</a> and <a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_20\">65</a>”.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">In Anvar’s case, this Court held as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      “22.

Generalia specialibus non derogant, special law will\n      always prevail over the general law. It appears, the court\n      omitted to take note of <a href=\"/doc/1385485/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections 59</a> and 65-A dealing with\n      the admissibility of electronic record. <a href=\"/doc/1456410/\" id=\"a_24\">Sections 63</a> and <a href=\"/doc/487818/\" id=\"a_25\">65</a>\n      have no application in the case of secondary evidence by\n      way of electronic record; the same is wholly governed by\n      Sections 65-A and 65-B. To that extent, the statement of\n      law on admissibility of secondary evidence pertaining to\n      electronic record, as stated by this Court in Navjot\n      Sandhu, does not lay down the correct legal position. It\n      requires to be overruled and we do so. An electronic\n      record by way of secondary evidence shall not be\n      admitted in evidence unless the requirements under\n      Section 65-B are satisfied. Thus, in the case of CD, VCD,\n      chip, etc., the same shall be accompanied by the\n      certificate in terms of Section 65-B obtained at the time of\n      taking the document, without which, the secondary\n      evidence pertaining to that electronic record, is\n      inadmissible.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      23.

Mr. Vivek Sood, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\nState of Haryana submitted that the CDRs were adduced in\n\nevidence without any objection from the defence.                     He\n\nsubmitted that the accused cannot be permitted to raise the\n\npoint of admissibility of the CDRs at the appellate stage.           He\n\nplaced reliance on <a href=\"/doc/1093202/\" id=\"a_27\">Padman v.

The first class is that a\n\ndocument is per se inadmissible in evidence. The second is\n\nwhere the objection is regarding the method or mode of the\n\nproof of the document. He submitted that the objection of the\n\naccused in this case is regarding the mode or method of proof\n\nas it cannot be said that the CDRs are per se inadmissible in\n\nevidence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"309307\" id=\"span_34\">25.   Refuting the contentions of the learned senior counsel for\n\nthe State, Mr. Luthra submitted that the objection raised by him\n\npertains to inadmissibility of the document and not the mode of\n\nproof.   He urged that the CDRs are inadmissible without the\n\ncertificate which is clear from the judgment of this Court in\n\nAnvar’s        case.    He   refers   to    the    judgment    of   <a href=\"/doc/309307/\" id=\"a_28\">RVE\n\nVenkatachala Gounder v.

That an electronic record is not admissible unless it is\n\naccompanied by a certificate as contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_31\">Section\n\n65B (4)</a> of the Indian Evidence Act is no more res integra. The\n\nquestion that falls for our consideration in this case is the\n\npermissibility of an objection regarding inadmissibility at this\n\nstage.      Admittedly, no objection was taken when the CDRs\n\nwere adduced in evidence before the Trial Court.              It does not\n\nappear from the record that any such objection was taken even\n\nat the appellate stage before the High Court. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1541904\" id=\"span_38\">In <a href=\"/doc/1541904/\" id=\"a_32\">Gopal Das v.\n\nSri Thakurji</a>, AIR 1943 PC 83, it was held that:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      “Where the objection to be taken is not that the\n      document is in itself inadmissible but that the mode of\n      proof put forward is irregular or insufficient, it is essential\n      that the objection should be taken at the trial before the\n      document is marked as an exhibit and admitted to the\n      record. A party cannot lie by until the case comes before\n      a Court of Appeal and then complain for the first time of\n      the mode of proof.”\n\nIn RVE Venkatachala Gounder, this Court held as follows:\n</blockquote>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                        21</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">\f“Ordinarily an objection to the admissibility of evidence\nshould be taken when it is tendered and not subsequently.\nThe objections as to admissibility of documents in\nevidence may be classified into two classes: (i) an\nobjection that the document which is sought to be proved\nis itself inadmissible in evidence; and (ii) where the\nobjection does not dispute the admissibility of the\ndocument in evidence but is directed towards the mode\nof proof alleging the same to be irregular or insufficient.\nIn the first case, merely because a document has been\nmarked as &#x27;an exhibit&#x27;, an objection as to its admissibility\nis not excluded and is available to be raised even at a\nlater stage or even in appeal or revision. In the latter\ncase, the objection should be taken before the evidence is\ntendered and once the document has been admitted in\nevidence and marked as an exhibit, the objection that it\nshould not have been admitted in evidence or that the\nmode adopted for proving the document is irregular\ncannot be allowed to be raised at any stage subsequent\nto the marking of the document as an exhibit. The later\nproposition is a rule of fair play. The crucial test is\nwhether an objection, if taken at the appropriate\npoint of time, would have enabled the party\ntendering the evidence to cure the defect and\nresort to such mode of proof as would be regular.\nThe omission to object becomes fatal because by\nhis failure the party entitled to object allows the\nparty tendering the evidence to act on an\nassumption that the opposite party is not serious\nabout the mode of proof. On the other hand, a\nprompt objection does not prejudice the party\ntendering the evidence, for two reasons: firstly, it\nenables the Court to apply its mind and pronounce\nits decision on the question of admissibility then\nand there; and secondly, in the event of finding of\nthe Court on the mode of proof sought to be\nadopted going against the party tendering the\nevidence, the opportunity of seeking indulgence of\nthe Court for permitting a regular mode or method\nof proof and thereby removing the objection raised\nby the opposite party, is available to the party\nleading the evidence. Such practice and procedure is\nfair to both the parties. Out of the two types of objections,\nreferred to hereinabove, in the later case, failure to raise\na prompt and timely objection amounts to waiver of the\nnecessity for insisting on formal proof of a document, the\ndocument itself which is sought to be proved being\nadmissible in evidence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1221542\" id=\"span_40\">In the first case, acquiescence\nwould be no bar to raising the objection in superior\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                 22</span>\n\f      Court.” [Emphasis supplied]\n\nIt would be relevant to refer to another case decided by this\n\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1221542/\" id=\"a_33\">PC Purshothama Reddiar v. S Perumal</a>, (1972) 1\n\nSCC 9. The earlier cases referred to are civil cases while this\n\ncase pertains to police reports being admitted in evidence\n\nwithout objection during the trial. This Court did not permit\n\nsuch an objection to be taken at the appellate stage by holding\n\nthat:</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">      “Before leaving this case it is necessary to refer to one of the\n      contentions taken by Mr. Ramamurthi, learned Counsel for the\n      respondent. He contended that the police reports referred to\n      earlier are inadmissible in evidence as the Head-constables\n      who covered those meetings have not been examined in the\n      case. Those reports were marked without any objection. Hence\n      it is not open to the respondent now to object to their\n      admissibility.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">27.     It is nobody’s case that CDRs which are a form of\n\nelectronic record are not inherently admissible in evidence.\n\nThe objection is that they were marked before the Trial Court\n\nwithout a certificate as required by Section 65B (4). It is clear\n\nfrom the judgments referred to supra that an objection relating\n\nto the mode or method of proof has to be raised at the time of\n\nmarking of the document as an exhibit and not later.                     The\n\ncrucial test, as affirmed by this Court, is whether the defect\n\ncould have been cured at the stage of marking the document.\n\nApplying this test to the present case, if an objection was taken\n\nto the CDRs being marked without a certificate, the Court could\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                         23</span>\n\fhave given the prosecution an opportunity to rectify the\n\ndeficiency. It is also clear from the above judgments that\n\nobjections regarding admissibility of documents which are per\n\nse inadmissible can be taken even at the appellate stage.\n\nAdmissibility of a document which is inherently inadmissible is\n\nan issue which can be taken up at the appellate stage because\n\nit is a fundamental issue.   The mode or method of proof is\n\nprocedural and objections, if not taken at the trial, cannot be\n\npermitted at the appellate stage. If the objections to the mode\n\nof proof are permitted to be taken at the appellate stage by a\n\nparty, the other side does not have an opportunity of rectifying\n\nthe deficiencies.   The learned Senior Counsel for the State\n\nreferred to statements under <a href=\"/doc/357596/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 161</a> of the Cr. P.C. 1973 as\n\nan example of documents falling under the said category of\n\ninherently inadmissible evidence. CDRs do not fall in the said\n\ncategory of documents. We are satisfied that an objection that\n\nCDRs are     unreliable due to    violation   of the procedure\n\nprescribed in Section 65 B (4) cannot be permitted to be raised\n\nat this stage as the objection relates to the mode or method of\n\nproof.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">28.   Another point which remains to be considered is whether\n\nthe accused is competent to waive his right to mode of proof.\n\nMr. Luthra’s submission is that such a waiver is permissible in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                 24</span>\n\fcivil cases and not in criminal cases.         He relies upon a\n\njudgment of the Privy Council in Chainchal Singh’s case in\n\nsupport of the proposition.     The Privy Council held that the\n\naccused was not competent to waive his right. Chainchal\n\nSingh’s case may have no application to the case in hand at\n\nall.    In that case, the issue was under <a href=\"/doc/800773/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 33</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act, and was whether evidence recorded in an earlier\n\njudicial proceeding could be read into, or not.     The question\n\nwas whether the statements made by a witness in an earlier\n\njudicial proceeding can be considered relevant for proving the\n\ntruth or facts stated in a subsequent judicial proceeding.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/800773/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 33</a> of the Evidence Act allows for this inter alia where\n\nthe witness is incapable of getting evidence in the subsequent\n\nproceeding.      In Chainchal Singh, the accused had not\n\nobjected to the evidence being read into in the subsequent\n\nproceeding. In this context, the Privy Council held that in a civil\n\ncase, a party can waive proof but in a criminal case, strict proof\n\nought to be given that the witness is incapable of giving\n\nevidence.      Moreover, the judge must be satisfied that the\n\nwitness cannot give evidence.       Chainchal Singh also held\n\nthat:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">        “In a civil case a party can, if he chooses, waive the\n        proof, but in a criminal case strict proof ought to be\n        given that the witness is incapable of giving\n        evidence”.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                    25</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">\fThe witness, who had deposed earlier, did not appear in the\n\nsubsequent proceeding on the ground that he was unable to\n\nmove from his house because of tuberculosis, as deposed by\n\nthe process server.     There was no medical evidence in this\n\nregard. The Court observed that the question of whether or not\n\nhe was incapable of giving evidence must be proved in this\n\ncontext, and in the proof of such a fact it was a condition that\n\nstatements given in an earlier proceeding can be taken as\n\nproved in a subsequent proceeding. Chainchal Singh’s case\n\ntherefore, does not lay down a general proposition that an\n\naccused cannot waive an objection of mode of proof in a\n\ncriminal case. In the present case, there is a clear failure to\n\nobject to the mode of proof of the CDRs and the case is\n\ntherefore covered by the test in            R.V.E. Venkatachala\n\nGounder.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">29.   We proceed to deal with the submission of Mr. Luthra that\n\nthe ratio of the judgment of the Bombay High Court in Shaikh\n\nFarid’s case is not applicable to the facts of this case. It was\n\nheld in Shaikh Farid’s case as under:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">       “6. In civil cases mode of proof can be waived by the\n      person against whom it is sought to be used. Admission\n      thereof or failure to raise objection to their tendering in\n      evidence amount to such waiver. No such waiver from\n      the accused was permissible in criminal cases till the\n      enactment of the present <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_37\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a> in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                    26</span>\n\f1973. The accused was supposed to be a silent spectator\nat the trial, being under no obligation to open his mouth\ntill the occasion to record his statement under section\n342 (present S. 313) of the Code arose. Even then he\nwas not bound to answer and explain the circumstances\nput to him as being appearing against him. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"196801\" id=\"span_46\">In the case\nof <a href=\"/doc/196801/\" id=\"a_38\">Chainchal Singh v.

Section 294 of the Code is introduced to dispense with\nthis avoidable waste of time and facilitate removal of\nsuch obstruction in the speedy trial. The accused is now\nenabled to waive the said right and save the time. This is\na new provision having no corresponding provision in the\nrepealed <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_39\">Code of Criminal Procedure</a>. It requires the\nprosecutor or the accused, as the case may be, to admit\nor deny the genuineness of the document sought to be\nrelied against him at the outset in writing. On his\nadmitting or indicating no dispute as to the genuineness,\nthe Court is authorised to dispense with its formal proof\nthereof. In fact after indication of no dispute as to the\ngenuineness, proof of documents is reduced to a sheer\nempty formality. The section is obviously aimed at\nundoing the judicial view by legislative process.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">8. The preceding Section 293 of the Code also dispenses\nwith the proof of certain documents. It corresponds\nwith Section 510 of the repealed <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_40\">Code of Criminal\nProcedure</a>. It enumerates the category of documents,\nproof of which is not necessary unless the Court itself\nthinks it necessary. Section 294 makes dispensation of\nformal proof dependent on the accused or the\nprosecutor, not disputing the genuineness of the\ndocuments sought to be used against them. Such\ncontemplated dispensation is not restricted to any class\nor category of documents as under section 293, in which\nordinarily authenticity is dependent more on the\nmechanical process involved than on the knowledge,\nobservation or the skill of the author rendering oral\nevidence just formal. Nor it is made dependent on the\nrelative importance of the document or probative value\nthereof. The documents being primary or secondary or\nsubstantive or corroborative, is not relevant for\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                              27</span>\n\f         attracting Sec. 294 of the Code.

Now the post-mortem report is also a document as\n         any other document. Primary evidence of such a\n         document is the report itself. It is a contemporaneous\n         record, prepared in the prescribed form, of what the\n         doctor has noticed in the course of post-mortem of the\n         dead body, while investigation the cause of the death. It\n         being relevant, it can be proved by producing the same.\n         But production is only a step towards proof of it. It can be\n         received in evidence only on the establishment of its\n         authenticity by the mode of its proof as provided\n         under <a href=\"/doc/884542/\" id=\"a_41\">sections 67</a> to <a href=\"/doc/693536/\" id=\"a_42\">71</a> of the Evidence Act. Section\n         294(1) of the Code enables the accused also, to waive\n         this mode of proof, by admitting it or raising no dispute\n         as to its genuineness when called upon to do so under\n         sub-section (1). Sub-section (3) enables the Court to read\n         it in evidence without requiring the same to be proved in\n         accordance with the <a href=\"/doc/1953529/\" id=\"a_43\">Evidence Act</a>. There is nothing\n         in Section 294 to justify exclusion of it, from the purview\n         of “documents” covered thereby.

All the\n\ncriminal courts in this country are bound to follow the law as\n\ninterpreted by this Court.       Because of the interpretation of\n\nSection 65B in Navjot Sandhu, there was no necessity of a\n\ncertificate for proving electronic records. A large number of\n\ntrials have been held during the period between 04.08.2005\n\nand 18.09.2014. Electronic records without a certificate might\n\nhave been adduced in evidence.              There is no doubt that the\n\njudgment of this Court in Anvar’s case has to be retrospective\n\nin operation unless the judicial tool of ‘prospective overruling’\n\nis applied. However, retrospective application of the judgment\n\nis not in the interests of administration of justice as it would\n\nnecessitate the reopening of a large number of criminal cases.\n\nCriminal cases decided on the basis of electronic records\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                       29</span>\n\fadduced in evidence without certification have to be revisited\n\nas and when objections are taken by the accused at the\n\nappellate stage.

State of Punjab, (1967)\n\n2 SCR 762 held that there is no acceptable reason why it could\n\nnot restrict the operation of the law declared by it to the future\n\nand save transactions that were effected on the basis of earlier\n\nlaw. While referring to the doctrine of prospective overruling as\n\nexpounded by jurists George F. Canfield, Robert Hill Freeman,\n\nJohn Henry Wigmore and Cardozo, this Court held that when a\n\nsubsequent decision changes an earlier one, the latter decision\n\ndoes not make law but rather discovers the correct principle of\n\nlaw and the result is that it is necessarily retrospective in\n\noperation.    As the law declared by this Court is the law of land,\n\nit was held that there is no reason why this Court declaring the\n\nlaw in supersession of the law declared by it earlier cannot\n\nrestrict the operation of the law as declared to the future and\n\nsave transactions that were affected on the basis of earlier law.\n\nWhile so holding, this Court in Golak Nath laid down the\n\nfollowing propositions:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">      “(1) The power of the Parliament to amend the\n      Constitution is derived from <a href=\"/doc/574894/\" id=\"a_46\">Articles 245</a><a href=\"/doc/77052/\" id=\"a_47\">, 246</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1270258/\" id=\"a_48\">248</a> of\n      the Constitution and not from <a href=\"/doc/594125/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 368</a> thereof which\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                     30</span>\n\f      only deals with procedure.

But, on the\n      basis of earlier decisions of this Court, they were valid.”\n\nWhile taking note of the doctrine of ‘prospective overruling’ in\n\nthe United States, this Court referred to the decisions\n\nconcerning      the    admissibility    of   evidence     obtained     by\n\nunreasonable search and seizure.               In Weeks v. United\n\nStates, 232 U.S. 383 (1914), the US Supreme Court held\n\nthat evidence obtained by an unreasonable search and seizure\n\nhas to be excluded in criminal trials.       In 1949, the US Supreme\n\nCourt in Wolf v. Colorado, 338 U.<a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_54\">S. 25 (1949)</a> held that the\n\nrule of exclusion laid down in Weeks did not apply to\n\nproceedings in State Courts. The judgment in Wolf was over\n\nruled in Mapp v. Ohio, 367 U.S. 643 (1961). Subsequently,\n\nthe US Supreme Court applied the doctrine of prospective\n\noverruling in Linkletter v. Walker, 381 U.S. 618 (1965) as it\n\nwas of the opinion that if Mapp was applied retrospectively it\n\nwould affect the interest of the administration of justice and the\n\nintegrity of the judicial process.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">34.

The\n      court did not seek to limit the effect of its judgment to the\n      future. I consider that there may be situations in which it\n      would be desirable, and in no way unjust, that the effect\n      of judicial rulings should be prospective or limited to\n      certain claimants. The European Court of Justice, though\n      cautiously and infrequently, has restricted the effect of its\n      ruling to the particular claimant in the case before it and\n      to those who had begun proceedings before the date of\n      its judgment. Those who had not sought to challenge\n      the legality of acts perhaps done years before\n      could only rely on the ruling prospectively.
