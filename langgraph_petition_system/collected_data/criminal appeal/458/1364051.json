It is stated by the complainant Ram Niwas\n\n(PW8) that they were two brothers and he was elder and Rambir @ Prithvi\n\n(deceased in the present case) was his younger brother. They were both married\n\nand resided separately with their families by constructing a house at the tubewell\n\nin their field.

Rambir (deceased) and the said unknown\n\nperson chatted there with each other and thereafter, they went towards village\n\nSihore on foot through the &#x27;katcha&#x27; (unmettled) passage. At that time, the\n\ncomplainant Ram Niwas (PW8) was taking his meal.          Their tubewell was\n\nsituated on the way leading to Sihore from Bahuwa. Rambir (deceased) did not\n\ncome back to the house during the night. They thought that he would be\n\nwatering the fields. Next morning Rambir (deceased) was not found in their\n\nfields. On 17.12.2001 at about 7.00 a.m., the complainant Ram Niwas (PW8)\n\nwas taking his camel-cart towards village Sihore for his personal work. When\n\nhe reached near the mustard crop field of Chandgi Ram son of Umrav, one\n\nperson was seen lying in the mustard crop field of Chandgi Ram. Ram Niwas\n\ncomplainant (PW8) stopped his camel-cart and went towards the place where the\n\nperson was lying. He found his brother Rambir @ Prithvi lying dead there. His\n\nmouth was filled with sand and there were scratches on his neck. His brother\n\nhad been put there after his murder had been committed.   It is further stated by\n\nthe complainant that they had a grudge for quite some days with Prabhu Dayal\n\nEx-Sarpanch son of Kalu Ram (father of the appellants in Crl. Appeal No. 263-\n\nDB of 2006). About two and a half to three years ago, Devender @ Virender\n\n(appellant No.3) and Yashwant (appellant No.2) sons of Prabhu Dayal and\n\nothers with an intention to kill his (complainant&#x27;s) uncle (chacha) namely Ram\n\nSingh (PW1) had run over their tractor on him (Ram Singh - PW1). On the\n\nstatement of Ram Singh (PW-1) - the uncle of the complainant, a case for the\n\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 307</a> IPC was registered against them i.e. Devender @\n\nVirender (appellant No.3), Yashwant (appellant No.2) and others.

The reason for\n\nthis which has been given is that three years ago i.e. on 1.5.1999 Devender @\n\nVirender son of Prabhu Dayal had driven the tractor over of his uncle Ram\n\nSingh (PW1) with an intention to kill him. Rambir (deceased) used to prosecute\n\n(sic. pursue) the case against Devender @ Virender regarding the aforesaid\n\nincident in respect of which a case under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 307</a> IPC had been registered\n\nwhich was pending in the Court.

On 16.12.2001, the marriage of grand\n\ndaughter of Prabhu Dayal who is the father of the four appellants in Crl. Appeal\n\nNo.263-DB of 2006 was to be solemnized. For the said occasion Raju @ Raj\n\nKumar son of Nathu Lal who is the son-in-law of Prabhu Dayal had come to\n\nvillage Sihore to attend the marriage. Complainant Ram Niwas (PW8) was\n\ncross-examined and he was confronted with his statement Ex.PG with regard to\n\nthe discrepancies and the contradictions. He (Ram Niwas PW8) had told the\n\npolice that the Pyjama of Rambir (deceased) was lying around his neck which\n\nwas not so recorded in his statement (Ex.PG).

He also said that while talking all the three had\n\ngone towards the house of one Prabhu son of Kalu Ram resident of Sihore.\n\nPrabhu was having enmity with them for sometime past because accused\n\nDevender @ Virender      had tried to kill him by driving his tractor over him.\n\nThe criminal case regarding the said incident was pending against him\n\n(Devender @ Virender ) under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 307</a> IPC at his instance. Rambir @\n\nPrithvi (deceased) used to pursue the case under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 307</a> IPC against\n\nDevender @ Virender because he was unable to move. Rambir (deceased) was\n\nalso a witness to the said occurrence.

There is no disclosure and no recovery qua\n\nDevender @ Virender and Yaswant. It may be noticed that the case was\n\ninitially investigated by Parbhati Lal SI (PW15) who as already noticed had\n\nrecorded the statement (Ex.PG) of complainant Ram Niwas (PW8) on which he\n\nmade his endorsement Ex.PG/1. The same was sent for registering the case on\n\nthe basis of which a formal FIR was registered. He also prepared inquest report\n\n(Ex.PS) and the rough site plan (Ex.PT). He also sent request to the doctor\n\n(Ex.PB) for conducting post mortem on the dead body of Rambir (deceased).\n\nThe investigation was then taken over by Inspector Daya Ram (PW14).\n\nAccording to him, he recorded the disclosure statement (Ex.PP) of Aklesh. It is\n\nstated that all the four accused jointly made &#x27;nishandehi&#x27; of the place of\n\noccurrence i.e. demarcation regarding pointing out the place of occurrence and\n\nmemo (Ex.PQ) in this regard was prepared which bears their signatures. The\n\nmemo of &#x27;nishandehi&#x27; (demarcation of the spot) Ex.PQ records that in the\n\npresence of the witnesses i.e. Ashok Kumar (PW12) and Nityanand,\n\ndemarcation of the place of occurrence was pointed out by the accused Krishan\n\nKumar at the first instance. After that it was demarcated by accused Aklesh,\n\nYashwant and Devender @ Virender. All the accused had demarcated the\n\nplace occurrence in the plot of Ex-Sarpanch Prabhu Dayal and admitted to have\n\nkilled Rambir near the &#x27;kikar&#x27; tree.   Memos of demarcation of the occurrence\n\nwere prepared separately. The witnesses put their signatures on the memo. The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> Crl.

Appeal No. 264-DB of 2006\n\n\ndemarcation memo Ex.PQ is in the nature of a confession by the accused while\n\nthey were in Police custody. Therefore, the same is to be excluded from\n\nevidence. The law does not permit the admission of such a confession in view\n\nof the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/494844/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 25</a> of the Evidence Act, 1872 nor is such a\n\nconfession admissible in terms of the conditions prescribed by <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 27</a> of the\n\nEvidence Act. For the application of <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 27</a>, the statement is to be split into\n\nits components so as to separate the admissible portion. Only those components\n\nor portions which are the immediate cause of the discovery inconsequence of the\n\ninformation received would be legal evidence and not the rest which are to be\n\nexcluded. A fact discovered in an information supplied by the accused in his\n\ndisclosure statement, is a relevant fact and that is only admissible in evidence if\n\nsomething new is discovered or recovered from the accused which was not in\n\nthe knowledge of the police before recording the disclosure statement of the\n\naccused. Nothing has been brought on record to show that the demarcation of\n\nthe place of occurrence was discovery of a new fact, which was not in the\n\nknowledge of the police. Even otherwise, the demarcation of the place of\n\noccurrence is not followed by recovery of any incriminating article so as to\n\nprovide a link in the chain of circumstances. Besides, any discovery on the\n\nbasis of information given by an accused is not by itself such a circumstance so\n\nas to establish the case of the prosecution. In fact the discovery in pursuance of\n\na disclosure statement under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act provides a link for\n\nthe prosecution to complete its chain of circumstances.         It is seldom the\n\nfoundation of the prosecution case. It may be noticed that the site plan Ex.PL\n\nof the place of recovery of lathi is prepared on 28.12.2001 by SI Laxmi Narain\n\n(PW9). The site plan of the demarcation of the place of occurrence is Ex.PQ\n\nand is prepared by Inspector Daya Ram (PW14). Inspector Daya Ram (PW14)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\"> Crl.

Appeal No. 264-DB of 2006\n\n\nstates that he had seen the site plans Ex.PL prepared by SI Laxmi Narain (PW9)\n\nand Ex.PR prepared by him. It is stated that both the site plans were of the same\n\nplace. It is accepted as correct that in the site plan (Ex PL) Laxmi Narain had\n\nshown the heap of fuel wood lying in the plot of Prabhu Dayal but in the site\n\nplan (Ex PR) prepared by him (Daya Ram PW14), he had not shown the same\n\nand had shown a heap of sand.       The lathi Ex.P11 is shown to have been\n\nrecovered from under the heap of firewood in pursuance of recovery memo (Ex\n\nPk). The lathi was recovered on the disclosure statement (Ex PJ) of Ram\n\nChander from his plot, which is the place of occurrence. However, on\n\n19.12.2001 when the demarcation of the place of occurrence is done in\n\npursuance of Ex PQ, the lathi was not recovered which is recovered later on\n\n28.12.2001 (Ex PK). In the site plan (Ex.PR) prepared by Inspector Daya Ram\n\n(PW14) on 19.12.2001 in the vacant plot of Prabhu Dayal the point mark &#x27;A&#x27; is\n\ndepicted as the place where the accused had beaten Rambir (deceased). At the\n\nsaid place, a heap of sand is shown. In the site plan Ex.PL prepared by SI\n\nLaxmi Narain (PW9) the place from where a lathi is shown as is recovered at\n\nthe place mark &#x27;A&#x27; which is same as in Ex.PR, however, a heap of fuel wood is\n\nshown to be lying. In the circumstances, the recovery of lathi (Ex P11) even is\n\ndoubtful.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">              Even the other recoveries that have been made are on the basis of\n\nthe disclosure statements of Krishan Kumar and Aklesh. Krishan Kumar made a\n\ndisclosure statement Ex.PN which was attested by Inspector Daya Ram (PW14).\n\nAklesh made a disclosure statement Ex.PP. Besides, Krishan Kumar, Virender\n\n@ Devender, Yashwant and Aklesh jointly made a &#x27;nishandehi&#x27; of the place of\n\noccurrence Ex.PQ. Ram Chander made a disclosure statement Ex.PJ regarding\n\nconcealment of a lathi under the heap of fuel wood. In the disclosure statement\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\"> Crl.

Appeal No. 264-DB of 2006\n\n\nEx.PN of Krishan Kumar, the manner in which the occurrence had taken place is\n\nnarrated. However, the said portion being inadmissible in evidence is not to be\n\ntaken into consideration. The aspect which, however, needs to be noticed is that\n\nit is stated by Krishan Kumar that after the occurrence he had concealed a torch\n\nnear &#x27;pulia&#x27; (small bridge) in the drainage of the village about which none else\n\nexcept he himself knew about. He could get the torch recovered. In pursuance\n\nof the said disclosure statement (Ex.PN), the torch was recovered vide recovery\n\nmemo Ex.PO. In terms of the disclosure statement (Ex.PP) of Aklesh again the\n\nentire incident in the manner in which it occurred has been narrated. The aspect\n\nwhich needs to be noticed is that it is stated by Aklesh that during the incident\n\nhis slippers came off and he had put on the slippers of Rambir (deceased) which\n\nhe had concealed on the way going towards the village and he could get them\n\nrecovered. In terms of recovery memo Ex.PH, an old pair of slippers bluish in\n\ncolour were recovered on the unmettled pathway which goes to village Sihore to\n\nBahuwa which had been concealed beneath the soil on the Northern side of the\n\npassage. On seeing the slippers Ram Niwas (PW8) identified them to be those\n\nof his brother. Ram Chander made a disclosure statement (Ex.PJ) in which he\n\nhad narrated the manner in which the occurrence took place. The same is also\n\nnot to be taken into account as it was made while Ram Chander was in police\n\ncustody. However, it may be noticed that he had disclosed that he inflicted\n\ninjuries to Rambir (deceased) with a lathi which was concealed under the fuel\n\nwood in his plot about which none else but only he knew. In pursuance of the\n\nrecovery memo Ex.PK, a lathi (Ex.P11) was recovered. The said recoveries i.e.\n\ntorch, a pair of slippers and a lathi in fact hardly advances the case of the\n\nprosecution and these in any case cannot be taken as substantive evidence.\n\nThese at the most are only corroborative evidence and in the absence of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\"> Crl.

Appeal No. 264-DB of 2006\n\n\nsubstantive evidence it    would be wholly unsafe to place reliance on such\n\nrecoveries. Besides, qua Devender @ Virender and Yashwant, no recoveries\n\nhave been made. The witness of recovery memo Ex.PH of slippers is Ram\n\nNiwas complainant (PW8) and Nityanand.           The witness of the disclosure\n\nstatement Ex.PJ of Ram Chander is Mam Chand (PW13) and Ram Sarup. The\n\nwitness of recovery memo Ex.PK of lathi is Mam Chand (PW13) and Ram\n\nSarup. The witness of the disclosure statement Ex.PN of Krishan Kumar is\n\nAshok son of Hari Ram (PW12) and Nityanand. The witness of recovery memo\n\nEx.PO of torch is Ashok Kumar (PW12) and Nityanand.               The witness of\n\ndisclosure statement Ex.PP of Aklesh is Ashok Kumar (PW12) and Nityanand.\n\nThe witness of memo of demarcation of spot (Ex.PQ) is Nityanand and Ashok\n\nKumar (PW12). Therefore, it is primarily Ashok Kumar (PW12) and Nityanand\n\nwho are witnesses of the recovery, besides, Mam Chand (PW13).           Nityanand\n\nhas not been examined in the case. Mam Chand (PW13) has stated that in his\n\npresence Ram Chander accused made a disclosure statement Ex.PJ to the effect\n\nthat he had concealed a lathi under a heap of fuel wood which he could get\n\nrecovered. The lathi (Ex.P11) was recovered which was taken in possession\n\nvide memo Ex.PK which also bears the signatures of Mam Chand (PW13). In\n\ncross examination it is accepted as correct that a criminal case was registered by\n\none Balbir of village Sihore against him (Mam Chand - PW13), Nityanand\n\nLambardar, Siri Ram and the then Naib Tehsildar Kanina for the offences under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_32\">Sections 420</a> IPC etc. Therefore, Mam Chand (PW13) is a co-accused with\n\nNityanand in a case under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 420</a> IPC. To a suggestion it is stated by Mam\n\nChand (PW13) that he did not know if accused Jaswant @ Yaswant, Ram\n\nChander etc. sons of Prabhu Dayal had filed a civil suit against Ram Sarup son\n\nof Bihari Lal who is a witness in this case. It is, however, stated as correct that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\"> Crl. Appeal No. 263-DB of 2006 and                                    [24]</span>\n\nCrl. Appeal No. 264-DB of 2006\n\n\nin the said case, he (Mam Chand - PW13) had appeared as a witness of Ram\n\nSarup son of Bihari Lal on 6.3.1996 in the Court at Mohindergarh.            He,\n\nhowever, did not know if that case was filed by the accused persons against\n\nRam Sarup. Ashok Kumar (PW12) has deposed that on 19.12.2001, he along\n\nwith Nityanand went to the Police Station Kanyana as his brother Rambir\n\n(deceased) had been murdered. In his presence, the police interrogated Krishan\n\nKumar accused who made a disclosure statement (Ex.PN). In pursuance of the\n\nsaid statement, a torch chargeable with the electricity was recovered from the\n\ndisclosed place i.e. under the bridge of dirty drain which was taken in\n\npossession vide memo Ex.PO. The memo was signed by him and Nityanand,\n\nbesides the police officials. He identified the torch (Ex.P12). Aklesh accused\n\nwas also interrogated by the police in his (Nityanand&#x27;s) presence. Aklesh also\n\nmade a disclosure statement Ex.PP on which Ashok Kumar (PW12) and\n\nNityanand had signed. In pursuance of the disclosure statement, Aklesh got a\n\npair of slippers recovered from the disclosed place on the way leading village\n\nSihore to Bahuwa. The slippers were taken in possession vide memo Ex.PH.\n\nHe identified the slippers Ex.P9 and Ex.P10. The slippers were identified by\n\nRam Niwas (PW8) brother of Rambir (deceased). In cross examination, it is\n\nstated that Krishan Kumar accused made a disclosure statement within 15 -20\n\nminutes of his interrogation by the police.      However, Aklesh made his\n\ndisclosure statement within 10 minutes of his interrogation. The police along\n\nwith them had started from Police Station for effecting the recoveries in\n\npursuance of the disclosure statements of the accused Krishan Kumar and\n\nAklesh. They went to the spot by police Jeep. He (Ashok Kumar - PW12) did\n\nnot remember the police officials accompanying them at that time. He could\n\nnot tell if their number was 1, 2, 3, 4 or 10. He did not know the official\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\"> Crl. Appeal No. 263-DB of 2006 and                                          [25]</span>\n\nCrl. Appeal No. 264-DB of 2006\n\n\nheading the police party. He did not know about his rank in the police.            He\n\ncould be even a Constable or Superintendent of Police. They first went to the\n\ndirty drain bridge from where Krishan Kumar accused got the torch recovered.\n\nIt is further stated that several villagers had also gathered at the time of recovery\n\nof slippers of accused Aklesh. It is stated as correct that the torch like that of\n\nEx.P12 and the slippers Ex. P9 and Ex.P10 were commonly available in the\n\nmarket.    It may be noticed that Ashok Kumar (PW12) is related to the\n\ncomplainant     Ram Niwas (PW8) and the deceased Rambir.                   In cross\n\nexamination, it is accepted that Jhabar is the father of Ram Niwas (PW8),\n\nbesides Jhabar is the brother of Hari Ram. Therefore, Ashok Kumar (PW12) is\n\nthe father&#x27;s brother&#x27;s son of the complainant Ram Niwas (PW8) and the\n\ndeceased Rambir, sons of Jhabar. Besides, he is resident of Baldhan Khurd\n\nwhich is a different village from where the recoveries were effected and the\n\ndisclosure statements recorded. He could not tell the number of police officials\n\nwho had accompanied them for the recoveries to be effected and as to who was\n\nheading the police party and what was his rank. He had though stated the place\n\nof recovery of the torch (Ex.P12) but had not stated that the place of recovery of\n\nthe slippers Ex.P9 and P10.          According to Ashok Kumar (PW12) the\n\ninterrogation of Krishan Kumar and Aklesh was done at the Police Station. He\n\nhad gone to Police Station on his own and was not called by the Police. It is\n\nalso stated that they went from the Police Station to effect recoveries. However,\n\nInspector Daya Ram (PW14)        stated in his cross examination that he arrested\n\nall the accused except Ram Chander from village on 19.12.2001. It is stated\n\nthat the accused were interrogated at the place of their arrest in village Sihore\n\nand they suffered their disclosure statements there. It is further stated that the\n\nslippers were recovered from the common passage in between village Sihore and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\"> Crl. Appeal No. 263-DB of 2006 and                                      [26]</span>\n\nCrl. Appeal No. 264-DB of 2006\n\n\nBhuwa. The passage, it is stated, is used by the general public. Ashok Kumar\n\n(PW12) has, however, stated that the interrogation of Krishan Kumar and\n\nAklesh was done in the Police Station. Therefore, there are discrepancies as\n\nregards the place of making of disclosure statements by the accused inasmuch as\n\naccording to Ashok Kumar (PW12) the interrogation of Krishan Kumar and\n\nAklesh was done at the Police Station where they made their disclosure\n\nstatements. However, according to Inspector Daya Ram (PW14), the accused\n\nexcept for Ram Chander were arrested from their village Sihore on 19.12.2001\n\nand the accused were interrogated at the place of their arrest in the village,\n\nwhere they suffered their disclosure statements. As such, the recoveries of the\n\ntorch (Ex.P12) and slippers (Exs.P9 and P10) become somewhat doubtful. Ram\n\nChander accused was arrested by SI Laxmi Narain (PW9) on 28.12.2001. It is\n\nstated by SI Laxmi Narain (PW9) that Ram Chander was interrogated in the\n\npresence of Mam Chand and Ram Sarup. On the disclosure statement Ex.PJ, a\n\nlathi (Ex.P11) was recovered which was taken in possession vide recovery\n\nmemo Ex.PK. In cross examination, it is stated that the place of recovery of the\n\nlathi is an open place and is accessible to one and all. Besides, such types of\n\nlathis were available almost in every agricultural household. It was also stated\n\nthat there was no special mark for identification of the lathi and there was no\n\nblood visible on the lathi. Therefore, the recovery of lathi which is commonly\n\navailable also would not, in the circumstances, advance the case of the\n\nprosecution so as to hold that the prosecution case stands established beyond\n\nshadow of reasonable doubt. The defence has produced on record Ex.D2/1\n\nwhich is the copy of statement of Mam Chand (PW13) when he appeared as\n\nDW1 in the suit for permanent injunction filed by Jaswant @ Yashwant, Ram\n\nChander and Krishan Kumar sons of Prabhu Dayal against Ram Sarup and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\"> Crl.

Appeal No. 264-DB of 2006\n\n\nBalbir sons of Bihari Lal etc. Mam Chand (PW13) has appeared as a witness for\n\nRam Sarup son of Bihari Lal who is one of the witness to the recoveries\n\nreferred to above. The said Ram Sarup son of Bihari has not been examined as\n\na witness in the present case.      It has also come in the deposition of the\n\ncomplainant Ram Niwas (PW8) that a cross case for the offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_34\">Section\n\n307</a> IPC was pending against him, his father, Misri widow of Rambir\n\n(deceased), Bhanti wife of Ram Niwas complainant (PW8) and his mother\n\nVidya Devi, Maya Devi wife of Ram Singh (PW1) and Pawan Kumar (PW11)\n\nwhich was fixed for 30.3.2003 in the Court. It is accepted as correct by Ram\n\nNiwas (PW8) that Ram Sarup son of Bihari Lal is a witness of the prosecution in\n\nthe present case and he was also a witness from their side in the case under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 307</a> IPC. It may also be noticed that insofar as the recovery of slippers\n\nExs.P9 and P10 is concerned, it would seem highly improbable that the accused\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">- Aklesh would wear the slippers of the deceased as his own slippers, which\n\nare stated to have come off. It is the case of the prosecution that the slippers of\n\nAklesh had come off. However, there is no mention of the slippers of Aklesh\n\nwhich are stated to have come off. SI Laxmi Narain (PW9) has stated that there\n\nwas no blood visible on the lathi (Ex.P11) that was recovered. In any case, the\n\nlathi (Ex.P11) is not shown to have been even sent to the Forensic Science\n\nLaboratory.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">               As regards the motive, it may be noticed that according to the\n\ncomplainant Ram Niwas (PW8), he had suspected Raju @ Raj Kumar son of\n\nNathu Ram resident of Baldhan Kalan who has not been sent up for trial,\n\nbesides Virender @ Devender , Yashwant, Ram Chander and Krishan Kumar\n\nsons of Prabhu Dayal as also Lalit Kumar son of Devender who has also not\n\nsent up for trial as the accused who had committed the murder of Rambir. This\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\"> Crl. Appeal No. 263-DB of 2006 and                                       [28]</span>\n\nCrl. Appeal No. 264-DB of 2006\n\n\nwas because three years ago i.e. on 1.5.1999 Devender @ Virender son of\n\nPrabhu Dayal had driven the tractor over his uncle Ram Singh (PW1) with an\n\nintention   to kill him.   Rambir (deceased) used to pursue the case against\n\nDevender @ Virender        regarding the aforesaid incident for the offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 307</a> IPC. Raju @ Raj Kumar had also threatened 2-3 times earlier that\n\nRambir should stop pursuing the case against Devender        @ Virender under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 307</a> IPC. It may be noticed that Raju @ Raj Kumar is the brother-in-law\n\nof the appellants other than Aklesh. This would in a way give the impression\n\nthat an attempt has been made to rope in the entire family of the appellants. In\n\nany case it may be noticed that the complainant Ram Niwas (PW8) had stated\n\nthat in the case under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 307</a> IPC, Rambir (deceased) and one doctor\n\nremained to be examined before 16.12.2001. Ram Niwas (PW8), Ram Singh\n\n(PW1), Subey Singh and Ram Sarup had already been examined in the said\n\ncase. He did not know as to who were the other prosecution witnesses of the\n\nsaid case. He denied the suggestion that in the said case Rambir (deceased) was\n\nnot left to be examined by 16.12.2001. Insofar as the occurrence of 1.5.1995 in\n\nwhich Virender @ Devender is stated to have run the tractor over Ram Singh\n\n(PW1) is concerned, the same in fact is not proximate to the incident of\n\n16.12.2001 that had occurred in the present case. Therefore, even if there was a\n\nmotive it was not    proximate in time to the occurrence. It may however be\n\nnoticed that the allegations of motive have not been put to the accused in their\n\nstatements under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 313</a> CrPC. The said provision has been enacted to\n\nenable the accused to explain any circumstances appearing in evidence against\n\nhim. Even otherwise, it may be noticed that motive is a double-edged weapon.\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"177569\" id=\"span_27\">In <a href=\"/doc/177569/\" id=\"a_40\">State of Punjab v.

Besides, animosity is a double-edged sword and it\n\ncould be a ground for false implication and also could be a ground for assault. It\n\nwas further observed that motive, however, strong merely creates a suspicion\n\nand suspicion cannot take the place of proof of guilt. Therefore, evidently\n\nthough motive however strong cannot take the place of actual proof. Besides, it\n\ncannot be made the sole basis for conviction. The case as has already been\n\nnoticed is based on circumstantial evidence.

The contention of the learned counsel\n\nfor the State that it was at the most was a case of defective investigation is also\n\nof not such a circumstance which would warrant the recording of a finding of\n\nguilt.   The evidence and material on record which is based on circumstantial\n\nevidence, does not establish the guilt of the appellants.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">             From the above, it may be noticed that:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">   (a)     Aklesh is stated to have come on 16.12.2001 and called Rambir\n\n           (deceased). This is on the statement of Pawan Kumar (PW11) made\n\n           in Court. It is stated by Pawan Kumar (PW11) that he had known\n\n           Aklesh earlier also. However, this aspect is not stated before the\n\n           Police and it has come on record in the FIR that an unidentified\n\n           person had come to the &#x27;Kothri&#x27; (constructed shed) of the tubewell\n\n           and called Rambir (deceased) and they chatted amongst themselves\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\"> Crl.

Appeal No. 264-DB of 2006\n\n\n         for sometime and then went away together towards the village.\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">         Therefore, Aklesh has been named as the person who called Rambir\n\n         (deceased) in the Court only.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">  (b)    The recoveries in the case are doubtful. The torch (Ex PO) has been\n\n         recovered on the disclosure statement (Ex PN) of Krishan Kumar.\n\n         Besides, a pair of slippers (Exs P9 and P10) of Rambir (deceased)\n\n         have been recovered on the disclosure statement (Ex PP) of Aklesh.\n\n         According to Ashok Kumar (PW12), he had gone to Police Station\n\n         Kanina and in his presence, the Police interrogated Krishan Kumar\n\n         who made a disclosure statement (Ex PN) and also interrogated\n\n         Aklesh who made a disclosure statement (Ex PP).               However,\n\n         according to Inspector Daya Ram (PW14), he had arrested Krishan\n\n         Kumar and Aklesh as also Virender and Yashwant on 19.12.2001 in\n\n         village Sihore and they were interrogated there and they made their\n\n         disclosure statements also at the village. Therefore, the place where\n\n         the disclosure statements are recorded of Krishan Kumar and Aklesh\n\n         are different, which creates a doubt about their genuiness;\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">  (c)    The recovery of Lathi (Ex P11) on the disclosure statement (Ex PK)\n\n         of Ram Chander is also doubtful as the said Lathi, it has come on\n\n         record, is easily available in agricultural houses.       Besides, the\n\n         recovered Lathi has not been found to be blood-stained and neither\n\n         was it sent to FSL for examination. The recoveries, as noticed, do\n\n         not advance the case of the prosecution so as to establish the guilt of\n\n         the appellants beyond shadow of doubt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">  (d)    The prosecution witnesses are close relatives and have not seen the\n\n         actual occurrence. Even the witnesses of recovery, it has come on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\"> Crl. Appeal No. 263-DB of 2006 and                                        [32]</span>\n\nCrl. Appeal No. 264-DB of 2006\n\n\n            record, are associated with the prosecution witnesses in connected\n\n            litigation between the appellants and the prosecution witnesses.\n\n            Therefore, not much reliance can be placed on the said witnesses so\n\n            as to establish the guilt of the appellants beyond shadow of doubt.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">   (e)      The motive is a double-edged sword and it can be a ground for\n\n            committing the murder as also a ground for false implication of the\n\n            appellants. Besides, the motive, however strong, cannot take place of\n\n            actual proof. Even otherwise, the case relating to the offence under\n\n            <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 307</a> IPC against Virender @ Devender, Yashwant and Sunita\n\n            wife of Ram Chander is of 1.5.1995 whereas the occurrence in the\n\n            present case is of 16.12.2001.      Therefore, the motive was not\n\n            proximate in time to the occurrence in the present case. The fact that\n\n            Rambir (deceased) was a witness in the case under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 307</a> IPC\n\n            relating to the occurrence of 1.5.1995, is also not of much\n\n            consequence as it has not been stated as to what was to be established\n\n            by Rambir (deceased) as regards the said occurrence. In other words,\n\n            it is not shown as to whether he was an eye-witness to the occurrence\n\n            who was to depose with respect to material facts and circumstances.\n\n            For the foregoing circumstances, the appeals are liable to be accepted\n\nand the order of the trial Court set aside.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">             Accordingly, Crl. Appeal No.263-DB and Crl. Appeal No.264-DB\n\nof 2006     are allowed and the judgment and order of the trial Court dated\n\n22.3.2006 is set aside.</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n\n                                                    (S.S.
