For disposal of these appeals it is not necessary to narrate\n\nthe facts in great detail.           FIR was registered on 31/05/1996\n\nagainst S.P.

It was, inter alia, alleged in the FIR that S.P. Gupta\n\nwhile posted and functioning as Divisional Manager in National\n\fInsurance Company Limited, Hoshiarpur, entered into a\n\ncriminal conspiracy with R.P. Chopra, Assistant Administrative\n\nOfficer, National Insurance Company Limited, Hoshiarpur,\n\nSanjiv Bhalla, Surveyor and Major Purshotam Singh (Retd.) -\n\nproprietor of M/s.

Gupta passed a fire claim of Rs.7,02,873/- and\n\nalso made part payment of Rs.2,00,000/- to Major Purshotam\n\nSingh (Retd.) on the basis of a false claim and that caused\n\npecuniary loss to the National Insurance Company Limited.\n\nThe FIR further stated how S.P. Gupta, Divisional Manager of\n\nNational Insurance Company Limited abused his official\n\nposition and by corrupt and illegal means obtained pecuniary\n\nadvantage for himself or for his co-accused.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">4.    The Central Bureau of Investigation (for short, ‘the CBI’)\n\ninvestigated the complaint and upon completion of the\n\ninvestigation, filed charge-sheet against (1) S.P. Gupta, (2)\n\nSanjiv Bhalla and (3) Major Purshotam Singh (Retd.) for\n\noffences under Section 120-B read with <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 420</a> of the IPC,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 420</a> of the IPC and <a href=\"/doc/86648814/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 13(1)(d)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1259316/\" id=\"a_4\">Section\n\n13(2)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 (for short, ‘the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_5\">PC Act</a>’).      The CBI examined 16 witnesses in support of its\n\ncase. The accused denied the prosecution case. The Special\nCrl. Appeal Nos._______@ SLP(Crl.) Nos.1002-03/12\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Page 3/13</span>\nJudge, CBI, Patiala, by his judgment and order dated\n\n30/11/1999 convicted each of the accused under Section\n\n120-B read with <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 420</a> of the IPC and sentenced them for\n\nthe said offence to undergo rigorous imprisonment for two\n\nyears and to pay a fine of Rs.2,000/- each and in default of\n\npayment of fine to undergo further rigorous imprisonment for\n\nsix months. The Special Judge further convicted Sanjiv Bhalla\n\nand Major Purshotam Singh (Retd.) under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 420</a> of the\n\fIPC and sentenced them to undergo rigorous imprisonment for\n\n2= years each and to pay a fine of Rs. 3,000/- each and in\n\ndefault of payment of fine to undergo further rigorous\n\nimprisonment for six months.                Only accused S.P.

The accused carried appeals to the High Court of Punjab\n\nand Haryana. The High Court, in the impugned order, noted\n\nthat during the pendency of the appeals accused S.P. Gupta\n\nhad died and, therefore, proceedings against him had abated.\n\nCounsel for the accused made a statement that he does not\n\nwant to challenge the conviction of the appellants on merits\n\nand he confines his arguments only to the quantum of\n\nsentence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">6.      Attention of the High Court was not drawn to the fact that\n\nonly accused S.P. Gupta, who had died, was convicted for\n\noffence under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_10\">PC Act</a>. Noting that counsel appearing for\n\nappellants had restricted the appeals only to the quantum of\n\nsentence,        the High Court         observed that since the accused\n\nwere facing mental agony of the trial and they had already\n\nsuffered imprisonment for twenty days during the trial                 after\n\nconviction they should be released                    on sentence already\n\nundergone by them. The High Court observed that a lenient\n\nview   in the matter of sentence should be taken and directed\nCrl.   Appeal Nos._______@ SLP(Crl.) Nos.1002-03/12\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">Page   5/13</span>\nthat   conviction recorded against the accused under Section\n\n120-B read with <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 420</a> of the IPC, <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 420</a> of the IPC\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 13(1)(d)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1259316/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 13(2)</a> of the PC Act shall\n\nbe maintained.

Gupta was convicted under the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_16\">PC Act</a>, the High Court could not have\n\nobserved that all the accused were convicted under the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_17\">PC Act</a> and could not have confirmed the said\n\nnon-existent conviction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">7.    The CBI, without applying its mind to the crucial fact that\n\nexcept accused SP Gupta none of the accused was convicted\n\nunder the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_18\">PC Act</a>, filed instant appeals in this\n\nCourt making grievance about their release on probation of\n\ngood conduct under the <a href=\"/doc/167447/\" id=\"a_19\">Probation of Offenders Act, 1958</a>\n\ndespite their alleged conviction under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_20\">PC Act</a>. Initially, in\n\nCrl. Appeal Nos._______@ SLP(Crl.) Nos.1002-03/12\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Page 6/13</span>\nthe appeal arising out of Criminal Appeal No.1231-SB of 1999\n\nfiled in the High Court, the CBI made S.P. Gupta a party\n\nrespondent.         As to how a dead man could be made a party\n\nrespondent in a criminal appeal is not understood by this\n\nCourt.        It appears that having realized its mistake, on\n\n27/01/2012 a submission was made in this Court that S.P.\n\nGupta who was an accused before the trial court was also\n\nimpleaded as one of the respondents, however, it appears from\n\nthe High Court judgment that S.P. Gupta had died even before\n\nthe case was heard by the High Court, and, therefore, some\n\ntime may be granted to make necessary corrections in the\n\nappeals.       This Court granted two weeks time to the CBI to\n\nmake necessary corrections.                Thereafter, amended memo of\n\nparties was filed in which S.P. Gupta’s name was deleted.\n\nHowever, a bare look at the questions of law-‘A’ and ‘C’ framed\n\nby the CBI in the appeals makes it clear that they center\n\naround S.P. Gupta’s release on probation of good conduct\n\n\n\n\nCrl. Appeal Nos._______@ SLP(Crl.)

Nos.1002-03/12\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">Page 8/13</span>\nis sufficient to indicate that the main plank of CBI’s\n\nsubmissions is that a person who is convicted under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_26\">PC\n\nAct</a> cannot be released on probation of good conduct under the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/167447/\" id=\"a_27\">Probation of Offenders Act, 1958</a>.

A Parthiban2 . But, it is really not\n\nnecessary for us to go into this because S.P. Gupta is dead and\n\nhis name is deleted from the array of parties. To that extent\n\nthis appeal has become infructuous and this cannot be\n\ndisputed by counsel for the CBI. I am, however, unhappy to\n\nnote that the High Court also did not notice that other accused\n\fwere not convicted under the <a href=\"/doc/1331755/\" id=\"a_32\">PC Act</a> and observed that all were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">2</span>\n    (2006)11 SCC 473\nCrl.

Thus, the appeal was presented\n\nbefore the High Court in a casual manner. The High Court did\n\nnot notice that only S.P.

It was the duty of the counsel to apprise the\n\ncorrect facts to the High Court and it was the responsibility of\n\nthe High Court to correctly note the conviction and sentence of\n\neach of the accused.                  It could not have confirmed a\n\nnon-existent conviction of the accused.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">9.       The only challenge which remains to be dealt with is that\n\naccused Sanjiv Bhalla and accused Major Purshotam Singh\n\n(Retd.) were wrongly released on probation of good conduct. As\n\nalready noted, accused Sanjiv Bhalla and accused Major\n\nPurshotam Singh (Retd.) were convicted under Section 120-B\n\nread with <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 420</a> of the IPC and under <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 420</a> of the\n\nIPC.       They were sentenced for two years and 2= years\n\nrespectively for the said offences. Substantive sentences were\n\nordered to run concurrently.               The High Court was moved by\n\ntwenty days imprisonment undergone by the accused during\nCrl. Appeal Nos._______@ SLP(Crl.) Nos.1002-03/12\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Page 10/13</span>\ntrial and the agony of trial suffered by them. The High Court\n\ntook a lenient view and released the accused on probation of\n\ngood conduct under <a href=\"/doc/14315/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 4(1)</a> of the Probation of Offenders\n\nAct on their furnishing personal bonds in the sum of Rs.\n\n10,000/- each. It appears to be the case of the appellant that\n\nthe offence in which the accused were involved is grave and\n\nhence, the High Court wrongly exercised the discretion and\n\nreleased them on probation of good conduct. I am not inclined\n\nto     entertain     this    submission        because   the   offence   was\n\ncommitted in 1996.                 The impugned judgment is dated\n\n4/5/2010. We are in 2014. Accused Major Purshotam Singh\n\n(Retd.) has filed affidavit in this Court stating that he has\n\nalready completed his probation period and his surety has been\n\fdischarged by Special Judge, CBI Patiala by his order dated\n\n23/7/2012.            This Court does not have the necessary\n\nparticulars about accused Sanjiv Bhalla but by now his surety\n\nmust have been also discharged.
