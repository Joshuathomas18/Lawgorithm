It was urged that it was a\n\n               case of consent and the girl was major and she had travelled\n\n               to different places and she had made a false statement in the\n\n               Court. It was urged that in the statement given to the\n\n               Magistrate, she had gone with Harpreet on a motorcycle\n\n               whereas the co-accused accompanied them on a scooter but\n\n               the complainant had spoken about a Tata Sumo which was\n\n               used to abduct the girl. It was urged that Mohammad Shafi\n\n               did not know any of the accused nor had seen them earlier,\n\n               therefore, for him to disclose about the incident, appears\n\n               totally doubtful on the face of it. It was also urged that the\n\n               prosecutrix had filed a complaint against her father where\n\n               she had disclosed that she was being pressurized to marry\n\n               an elder man and she had married Harpreet and she was\n\n               living with him as his wife and was happy with him.

It was\n\n               contended that there is a discrepancy in the statement of the\n\n               prosecutrix and her family even with respect to the family\n\n               members of the complainant and all of them have tried to\n\n               hide the number of children born as it would have proved\n\n               that the prosecutrix was major. It was also urged that the\n\n               complainant had 11 children and the prosecution has held\n\n               back their ages and it was for the prosecution to prove that\n\n               the victim was a minor and the oral statement could not be\n\n               accepted. Even no date, month or year of birth was stated by\n\n               any of the witness. It was further urged that the ossification\n\n               test was recommended by the doctors because they were not\n\n               convinced about the age that was given and according to the\n\n               ossification report the age is 15 - 16 years and the bone age\n\n               test is not a conclusive test and it is settled that in a criminal\n\n               trial if there are two opinions possible, the opinion favorable\n\n               to the accused is given precedence and if two years are\n\n               added then the age would be either 17 or 18 years.

It was Mohammad Shafi who had seen the\n\n               accused taking her in the Tata Sumo and the statement of\n\n               the victim should be accepted and the Court should not seek\n\n               any corroboration. It was urged that the girl was a minor and\n\n               the question of consent would not arise and there is no\n\n               evidence that accused Harpreet had performed marriage with\n\n               the prosecutrix. It is settled that in a case where the\n\n               prosecutrix alleges rape, her statement has to be accepted\n\n               without looking for corroboration.

Two of the daughters born to Bano wife of\n\n               Mehar Baksh were from the first marriage and five daughters\n\n               had been born to Mehar Baksh from second marriage.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">Sunil</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">2013.09.12 11:13</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">I attest to the accuracy and</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">integrity of this document</span>\n           Criminal Appeal No.2514-SB of 2010 (O&amp;M)\n                 with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">          Criminal Appeal No.3582-SB of 2012 (O&amp;M)                               -14-</span>\n\n               According to Mehar Baksh, the prosecutrix was his 7th child.\n\n               He had given his age as 56 years. According to him, his\n\n               children were born after a gap of one or two years and he\n\n               and his present wife were married for alst 35 years. It has\n\n               come in evidence that 4 - 5 children of the complainant had\n\n               been going to school. He had stated that he had given their\n\n               age in the school by approximation but neither the police\n\n               collected that material nor the complainant could produce or\n\n               give the date of birth of his children. Even the ration card of\n\n               complainant was not produced by the prosecution shows that\n\n               the prosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">               20.             The medical officer on the basis of the examination\n\n               of the x-ray gave his opinion regarding the bone age of the\n\n               prosecutrix between 15 - 16 years. There can be variance of\n\n               two years on either side. It is settled that in a criminal trial if\n\n               there are two opinions possible, the opinion favorable to the\n\n               accused is to be given precedence. It can definitely be held\n\n               that the age of the prosecutrix was above 16 years at the\n\n               relevant time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">               21.             Now, coming to the testimony of the witnesses, the\n\n               statement given by Mohammad Shafi - PW7 cannot be given\n\n               credence as he did not know any of the accused earlier. He\n\n               did not even know their names if he had seen that the\n\n               prosecutrix appeared to be terrified while sitting in the vehicle\n\n               he would not have come home and would have made an\n\n               attempt to speak to her. He had stated that the girl had been\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">Sunil</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">2013.09.12 11:13</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">I attest to the accuracy and</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">integrity of this document</span>\n           Criminal Appeal No.2514-SB of 2010 (O&amp;M)\n                 with\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">          Criminal Appeal No.3582-SB of 2012 (O&amp;M)                             -15-</span>\n\n               taken in any Tata Sumo. The police had carried out the\n\n               investigation. They could not recover any Tata Sumo. The\n\n               registration number of the vehicle was not noted by any\n\n               person.         Even the name of the owner of the vehicle did not\n\n               appear in the investigation. It appears that the girl was not\n\n               taken in a Tata Sumo and the witnesses have intentionally\n\n               introduced the story of a Tata Sumo as it would be difficult for\n\n               anyone to accept that the girl had been abducted on a\n\n               motorcycle. When the prosecutrix was produced before the\n\n               Magistrate, she had disclosed that she was taken on a\n\n               motorcycle and Harpreet&#x27;s mother Balwinder Kaur and her\n\n               son-in-law were on a separate scooter. The story appears to\n\n               be improbable. No mother would support her son in such kind\n\n               of incident. The prosecutrix had deposed that she did not\n\n               know any of the accused. In that case, she would not have\n\n               accompanied unknown persons on a motorcycle. It appears\n\n               that she was under pressure from her family, therefore, the\n\n               whole story was changed and the story of a Tata Sumo was\n\n               introduced. No young girl who has attained her puberty would\n\n               accompany a unknown boy to make purchase.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">               22.

She had also stated that her father had caught her at\n\n               bus stand Batala last week and beaten up. When the\n\n               prosecutrix was confronted with her statement, she stated\n\n               that the statement was made under threat and the Magistrate\n\n               was not present in the Court. No complaint was given by the\n\n               prosecutrix to the senior officers and it is an after thought.\n\n               The prosecutrix wanted to wriggle out of her statement\n\n               probably at the behest of her parents as it was a inter-religion\n\n               marriage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">               23.             The prosecutrix had lived with Harpreet for one and\n\n               a half month. She had visited his family and had stayed at\n\n               different places. She had also used public transport. She had\n\n               being going on the motorcycle. All this goes to show that the\n\n               accusations are false and the prosecution had been moving\n\n               freely and it was a case of consent. It seems that the\n\n               prosecution concocted the story to buy peace due to inter-\n\n               religion marriage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">               24.

It was urged that it was a\n\n               case of consent and the girl was major and she had travelled\n\n               to different places and she had made a false statement in the\n\n               Court. It was urged that in the statement given to the\n\n               Magistrate, she had gone with Harpreet on a motorcycle\n\n               whereas the co-accused accompanied them on a scooter but\n\n               the complainant had spoken about a Tata Sumo which was\n\n               used to abduct the girl. It was urged that Mohammad Shafi\n\n               did not know any of the accused nor had seen them earlier,\n\n               therefore, for him to disclose about the incident, appears\n\n               totally doubtful on the face of it. It was also urged that the\n\n               prosecutrix had filed a complaint against her father where\n\n               she had disclosed that she was being pressurized to marry\n\n               an elder man and she had married Harpreet and she was\n\n               living with him as his wife and was happy with him.

It was urged that if the prosecutrix did not know\n\n               Harpreet, there was no reason for her to accompany him\n\n               even to purchase some articles and that also shows the\n\n               falsity of the charges and there are material contradictions in\n\n               the statement made by the prosecutrix and her father. It was\n\n               contended that there is a discrepancy in the statement of the\n\n               prosecutrix and her family even with respect to the family\n\n               members of the complainant and all of them have tried to\n\n               hide the number of children born as it would have proved\n\n               that the prosecutrix was major. It was also urged that the\n\n               complainant had 11 children and the prosecution has held\n\n               back their ages and it was for the prosecution to prove that\n\n               the victim was a minor and the oral statement could not be\n\n               accepted. Even no date, month or year of birth was stated by\n\n               any of the witness. It was further urged that the ossification\n\n               test was recommended by the doctors because they were not\n\n               convinced about the age that was given and according to the\n\n               ossification report the age is 15 - 16 years and the bone age\n\n               test is not a conclusive test and it is settled that in a criminal\n\n               trial if there are two opinions possible, the opinion favorable\n\n               to the accused is given precedence and if two years are\n\n               added then the age would be either 17 or 18 years.

It was Mohammad Shafi who had seen the\n\n               accused taking her in the Tata Sumo and the statement of\n\n               the victim should be accepted and the Court should not seek\n\n               any corroboration. It was urged that the girl was a minor and\n\n               the question of consent would not arise and there is no\n\n               evidence that accused Harpreet had performed marriage with\n\n               the prosecutrix. It is settled that in a case where the\n\n               prosecutrix alleges rape, her statement has to be accepted\n\n               without looking for corroboration. Ordinarily no corroboration\n\n               is required in rape cases except in case of high improbability\n\n               of the prosecution case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">               15.

The prosecutrix as well as her father had stated\n\n               that the victim was of 14 - 15 years of age. When the victim\n\n               appeared in the witness box in 2009, she gave her age as 14\n\n               years.

Dr. Ashok\n\n               Bhagat had carried out the ossification test and had given\n\n               the bone age between 15 to 16 years.

He had stated that he had given their\n\n               age in the school by approximation but neither the police\n\n               collected that material nor the complainant could produce or\n\n               give the date of birth of his children.

The   police   had   carried   out   the\n\n               investigation. They could not recover any Tata Sumo. The\n\n               registration number of the vehicle was not noted by any\n\n               person.              Even the name of the owner of the vehicle did not\n\n               appear in the investigation. It appears that the girl was not\n\n               taken in a Tata Sumo and the witnesses have intentionally\n\n               introduced the story of a Tata Sumo as it would be difficult for\n\n               anyone to accept that the girl had been abducted on a\n\n               motorcycle. When the prosecutrix was produced before the\n\n               Magistrate, she had disclosed that she was taken on a\n\n               motorcycle and Harpreet&#x27;s mother Balwinder Kaur and her\n\n               son-in-law were on a separate scooter. The story appears to\n\n               be improbable. No mother would support her son in such kind\n\n               of incident. The prosecutrix had deposed that she did not\n\n               know any of the accused. In that case, she would not have\n\n               accompanied unknown persons on a motorcycle. It appears\n\n               that she was under pressure from her family, therefore, the\n\n               whole story was changed and the story of a Tata Sumo was\n\n               introduced.

No complaint was given by the\n\n               prosecutrix to the senior officers and it is an after thought.\n\n               The prosecutrix wanted to wriggle out of her statement\n\n               probably at the behest of her parents as it was a inter-religion\n\n               marriage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">               23.

She had also used public transport. She had\n\n               being going on the motorcycle. All this goes to show that the\n\n               accusations are false and the prosecution had been moving\n\n               freely and it was a case of consent. It seems that the\n\n               prosecution concocted the story to buy peace due to inter-\n\n               religion marriage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">               24.             From the above discussion, it is found that the\n\n               judgment of the trial Court suffers from legal flaws and has to\n\n               be set aside.

Lower Court records be sent\n\n               back.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">                                                      (ANITA CHAUDHRY)\n                                                           JUDGE\n\n               September 05, 2013\n               sunil\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_151\">Sunil</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">2013.09.12 11:13</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">I attest to the accuracy and</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">integrity of this document</span>\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\"> </span>","numcites":9,"numcitedby":12,"docsource":"Punjab-Haryana High Court","citetid":149995986,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"ossification test","formInput":"ossification%20test"},{"value":"rape ","formInput":"rape%20"},{"value":"rape case","formInput":"rape%20case"},{"value":" ossification test for age ","formInput":"%20ossification%20test%20for%20age%20"},{"value":"inter religion marriage","formInput":"inter%20religion%20marriage"},{"value":"intercourse sexual","formInput":"intercourse%20sexual"},{"value":"section 376 ipc","formInput":"section%20376%20ipc"},{"value":"false allegations","formInput":"false%20allegations"},{"value":"ipc 506","formInput":"ipc%20506"},{"value":"363 ipc","formInput":"363%20ipc"},{"value":"ipc 500","formInput":"ipc%20500"},{"value":"section 323","formInput":"section%20323"},{"value":"age of the prosecutrix","formInput":"age%20of%20the%20prosecutrix"},{"value":"pubic hair","formInput":"pubic%20hair"},{"value":"religion","formInput":"religion"},{"value":"ipc 376","formInput":"ipc%20376"},{"value":"indian penal code 506","formInput":"indian%20penal%20code%20506"},{"value":"366 ipc","formInput":"366%20ipc"},{"value":"kidnapping","formInput":"kidnapping"},{"value":"vagina","formInput":"vagina"}],"cats":[{"value":"indian-penal-code","formInput":"tag:indian-penal-code"},{"value":"kidnapping","formInput":"tag:kidnapping"},{"value":"kidnapping-to-compel-marriage","formInput":"tag:kidnapping-to-compel-marriage"},{"value":"rape","formInput":"tag:rape"},{"value":"criminal-conspiracy","formInput":"tag:criminal-conspiracy"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
