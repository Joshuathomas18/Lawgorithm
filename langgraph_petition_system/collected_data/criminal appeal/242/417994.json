SINHA,  J :\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\"> \tThese appeals arising out of a common judgment and order dated 22nd \nApril, 2004 passed by the High Court of Judicature at Allahabad in Crl. \nAppeal No. 660 of 1981 and Crl. Appeal No.668 of 1981 were taken up for \nhearing together and are being disposed of by this common judgment. \nCriminal Appeal No.1150 of 2004 is by Triloki Nath, Krishna Chandra \nSingh, Shashi Kant and Sahdev (Accused Nos.6, 5, 7 and 8 respectively).  \nCriminal Appeal Nos.1173, 1172 and 1173 of 2004 are respectively by \nKunwar Prahald Singh (Accused  No.1), Jitendra alias Mister (Accused \nNo.2) and Gopal (Accused No.3).  One of the eight accused namely, \nChhanga has not filed any appeal.  \n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">BACKGROUND FACT:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\"> \tThe residents of village Devanand Pur had been performing &quot;Holika \nDehan&quot; for a long time on Plot No. 399, which is said to be a banjar land.  \nKunwar Prahlad Singh became the owner of the said plot.  He tried to \nenclose the said plot by a &#x27;Mend&#x27;(Fence).  An objection thereto was raised \nby the villagers including Laxmi Shankar Srivastava (PW-3); a complaint \nwherefor was made pursuant whereto an intervention was made by the \npolice.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">FIRs RELATING TO INCIDENT:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"> \tOn the Basant Panchami day, the villagers allegedly fixed  &#x27;Dhah&#x27; as \na symbol of Holi on the said plot and started collecting fuel wood thereupon.  \nOn the said day at about 12 noon, Khuddey, PW-4 while going to the flour \nmill found the Appellants herein removing the wood.  The accused Jitendra  \narmed with a gun and the remaining accused armed with lathis were present.  \nKhuddey, PW-4, servant of Laxmi Shankar Srivastava, allegedly forbade \nthem from doing so whereupon he was chased.  Near the Hata of Pran, \nLaxmi Shankar Srivastava (PW-3), Sahjadey Jeevanlal (PW-2) Shabbir and \nother persons of the village arrived.  Laxmi Shankar Srivastava allegedly \nhad asked the accused as to why they have been chasing his servant. Triloki \nNath exhorted his companions saying &#x27;Maro Sale Ko&#x27; whereupon Gopal \nhurled a lathi blow on PW-3&#x27;s head.  Shashi Kant accused gave the second \nlathi blow on his wrist.  Kunwar Prahlad Singh and Sahdev also assaulted \nhim with lathis.  Chhanga and Krishna assaulted Sahjadey.  Khuddey (PW-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">4) is said to have hurled lathi blow in defence of Laxmi Shankar Srivastava \n(PW-3).  He thereafter raised hue and cry  which attracted Nanhe  (the \ndeceased),  and others.  Nanhe raised alarm saying that Lala (thereby \nmeaning Laxmi Shankar Srivastava) was being killed whereupon Triloki \nNath exhorted Jitendra asking him to kill him as he professes himself to be a \ngreat helper of Laxmi Shankar.  Responding thereto Jitendra fired a shot at \nNanhe.  He fell down and died.  \n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\"> \tA First Information Report was lodged by Dinesh Kumar Srivastava \n(PW-1) at about 2 p.m. on the same day. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">A First Information Report was also lodged by Kunwar Prahlad Singh \nSrivastava (Accused No.1)  at about 4.30 p.m. against Shahjadey, Bansidhar, \nKhuddey Chamar, Nanhe Chamar, Hira Passy, Shabbir and Laxmi Shankar \npurported to be for commission of an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 147</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_2\">323</a>/<a href=\"/doc/1672685/\" id=\"a_3\">352</a> of \nthe Indian Penal Code alleging that Dinesh Kumar under the pretext of \nperforming Holika Dahan placed some waste wood at Plot No. 399 and kept \non adding thereto.  He went to the said plot along with his sons Mister alias \nJitendra and Gopal at about 11 a.m. and  removed the said waste wood from \nhis land.  When they were returning,  Dinesh Kumar came on his motorcycle \nwith a child.  He  allegedly stopped his motorcycle and called his servant as \nalso Shahjaddey and Bansi Brahman and exhorted &quot;Jane na paye, mar pit \nlow&quot; whereupon they ran towards their house.  On the way, Khuddey \nChamar, Nanhe Chamar, Hira Passi, Shabbir, etc. came from the side of the \neast and south and  surrounded him.  The accused persons attacked Triloki.  \nSahdev and other persons ran towards him for his  rescue and when they had \nbeen running to save their lives, they heard a sound of gun-fire from behind.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">INJURIES ON THE ACCUSED:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\"> \tInjuries suffered by Triloki Nath in the said incident are as under:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">&quot;(1) Lacerated wound, 6 cm x = cm x scalp deep on the \nleft side of scalp, 6 cm above ear.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(2) Abraded contusion, 6 cm x 3 cm on the back of right \nshoulder.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\"> \tInjuries suffered by Sahdev are as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">&quot;(1) Lacerated wound, 2.5 cm x = cm x scalp deep, 3 cm \nbehind left ear.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(2) Abrasion, 1 cm x 1.5 cm on the front of left knee.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\"> \tBefore we advert to the submissions made by  the learned counsel for \nthe parties, we may notice some of the findings of the Trial Court and the \nHigh Court respectively. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">FINDINGS OF TRIAL COURT :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">(i)\t&quot;\u0005Kunwar Prahlad Singh accused had enough cause of \ngrievance against Laxmi Shanker Srivastava P.W.3 and \nDinesh Kumar Srivastava P.W.1.  Undisputedly Kunwar \nPrahlad Singh accused had his possession over plot No. \n399 in dispute and the same had also been proved by the \nKhasra entries for the period preceding the date of \noccurrence, and such khasra entries show the crop also of \nKunwar Prahlad Singh accused in the plot in dispute.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">(ii)\t&quot;Thus, the defence case that the accused Triloki and \nSahdeo had also received injuries in the same occurrence \nis also proved beyond doubt.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">(iii)\t&quot;As such, I find that the cause of grievance lay with the \naccused and not with the prosecution and it is quite \nprobable that the accused Kunwar Prahlad Singh might \nhave collected at the land in dispute fully armed with a \nview to effectively remove the fuel wood of Holi on the \nplot in dispute and to meet all resistance against it.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">FINDINGS OF HIGH COURT :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">(i)\t&quot;From the very inception the only logical inference is \nthat those accused had gone well prepared with lathies \nand fire arm to deal with the other side who were \nresisting removal of holika woods and they knew well \nthat the consequences may be of death merely because \nother accused did not have deadly weapon and except \nlathi, which is also one of the deadly weapon and is \ncapable of causing death, it is none other was caused \ndeath merely a chance or incident...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">(ii)\t&quot;\u0005It was found that the plot No. 399 was in possession \nof Kunwar Prahlad Singh on the preceding day of \noccurrence and he had grudge against these people who \nwere acting against his interest by keeping Holika.  \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">According to prosecution witnesses P.W.1 to P.W.4 it is \nevident that fuel woods for Holi had been stocked on the \nsaid plot.  There cannot be any grievance of P.W.1 D.K. \nSrivastava regarding this as neither P.W.1 nor P.W.3 \nclaimed this land adversely against their personal rights.  \nTheir only role was that P.W.1 D.K. Srivastava and \nP.W.3 L.S. Srivastava were playing leading role in \nburning of Holi.  Therefore, it was the land-holder who \nhad felt aggrieved.  There is also no suggestion that the \nwoods were stocked at the time of incident nor there is \nany case that Laxmi Shankar Srivastava, P.W. 3 and his \nassociates had collected arms to resist such removal of \nHoli.  There is probability that the defence side had \ncollected arms to take revenue (sic) or with a view of \nremoval of fuel wood of Holi and to meet the resistance \nagainst it.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">(iii)\t&quot;Learned trial court has held that if Nanhe was killed in \nthe occurrence and the same was in the light of private \ndefence, such contention of the learned counsel for the \naccused is absolutely false firstly because there is no case \nthat the occurrence took place on or near the land in \ndispute to take possession over it place of Holi or Nanhey \nhad gone near the land to take possession.  Secondly, the \nfight had taken place not at the plot in dispute but at a \nplace the distance of which has been stated by Khuddey, \nP.W.4 by an uncontroverted testimony, at 300 paces \naway from the disputed land.  Thirdly, it comes out from \nthe evidence that Kunwar Prahlad Singh accused had \nalready thrown away fuel woods from the plot in dispute \nbefore the occurrence took place and according to his \ndefence version he was proceeding from that place to his \nhouse and, therefore, finding of the trial court has \nsufficient reasons that the accused have not acted in their \nself-defence.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\tUpon completion of the trial, Jitnedra with other seven accused were \nfound guilty of commission of the offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_5\">149</a> for \ncommission of murder of Nanhe,  under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 307</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_7\">149</a> for causing injury \nto Laxmi Shankar Srivastava and under <a href=\"/doc/1258372/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 147</a> of the Indian Penal \nCode for rioting \n\n \tThe Trial judge by an order dated 17.9.1981 convicted and sentenced \nthe accused to  imprisonment for life for the offence of murder. The said \njudgment has been upheld by the High Court.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">SUBMISSIONS:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\"> \tMr. S.R. Bajawa, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the \nAppellants at the outset drew our attention to the fact that the injuries \nreceived by Laxmi Shankar Srivastava and Sahjadey are more or less similar \nto those received by Triloki Nath and Sahdev.  Such injuries received by the \nsaid Appellants, it was contended, must have given rise to an apprehension \nin their minds that one of them may be killed and as such the accused had \nrightly exercised their right of private defence.  Exercise of such right of \nprivate defence could not have been denied to the accused persons on the \nreasonings of the High Court, it was submitted, in view of the fact that \nalthough the place of occurrence was 300 paces away from the plot in \nquestion, both the incidents of removal of trespass from Plot No. 399 as also \nthe occurrence in question took place as a part of the same transaction.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\"> \tThe learned counsel furthermore drew our attention to the post-\nmortem report and submitted on the basis thereof that as blackening and \ntattooing and scorching were found, the same could not have been caused \nfrom a double barrel muzzle loaded gun which is said to be  the weapon of \noffence.  \n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\"> \tMr. Bajawa would submit that the impugned judgments of conviction \nof sentence are unsustainable as:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">(i)\tWitnesses have come up with half truth.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">(ii)\tThe actual reason for putting the woods on the plot in question was \nnot disclosed. The land was not lying fallow as wheat crop was grown \nthereon and, thus, the accused could not have been dispossessed \ntherefrom.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">(iii)\tThe complainants sent Khuddey to tease the accused and they had \nbeen waiting at some distance. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">(iv)\tThe accused had a right to remove the wood piled on their land.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">(v)\tThey  had no animus against Nanhe, deceased and, thus, they could \nnot have been convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_10\">149</a> of the Indian Penal Code.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">(vi)\tThere was no triggering point for firing at Nanhe except his so-called \nshouting that the accused persons would kill Lala meaning thereby \nLaxmi Shankar Srivastava, which cannot be relied upon.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">(vii)\tOnly one shot was fired from the gun as of necessity, as two of the \naccused persons were seriously injured. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">(viii)\tPW-2, the only independent witness, is not at all reliable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">(ix)\tAdmittedly, Khudday had also come with a lathi which established \nthat the complainant party was the aggressor.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">(x)\tKhudday did not suffer any injury which shows that the accused \npersons were not the aggressors.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">(xi)\tUnless Khudday was assaulted, no unlawful assembly could have \nbeen caused. \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">(xii)\tIn any view of the matter, the entire incident took place at the spur of \nthe moment.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\"> \tMr. R.K. Kapoor, learned counsel appearing on behalf of the \nAppellant in Criminal Appeal Nos. 1171 and 1172 of 2004 supplemented the \nsubmissions of Mr. Bajawa urging:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">(i)\tThe accused persons were not having any grudge against the \ndeceased.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">(ii)\tThere was no motive for  killing.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">(iii)\tThe complainants were only chased from the land, which by itself did \nnot constitute an offence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">(iv)\tKunwar Prahlad Singh and Gopal did not give any exhortation for the \ndeath of Nanhe and as such their conviction under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_12\">149</a> is \nwholly unsustainable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">(v)\tThe occurrence took place because of the interference with  \npossession of the Appellants in plot in question by Khuddey.  As the \nentire incident took place within 2-3 minutes,  there was hardly any \noccasion to form an unlawful assembly and a common object on the \nspot.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">(vi)\tThere was no intention to kill Nanhe and as such for his death, others \nare  not liable. \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\"> \tMr. Vijay Singh, learned counsel appearing on behalf of Shashikant in \nCriminal Appeal No. 1150 of 2004 drew our attention to the fact that he \nallegedly gave a lathi blow on the left wrist of Laxmi Shankar Srivastava \nwhereas in his cross-examination he stated that such injury was caused by \nGopal and submitted  that in that view of the matter he could not have been \nheld guilty.  He further submitted that sufficient material had been brought \non records to show that an election dispute was going on between the \nparties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\"> \tMr. N.S. Gahlout, learned counsel appearing in behalf of the State, on \nthe other hand,  submitted  that : (i) having regard to the statements made in  \nFirst Information Reports lodged by both the parties,  the time of occurrence \nas well as the place of occurrence must be held to have been admitted; (ii) \nthe death of Nanhe and the injuries suffered by Laxmi Shankar Srivastava \nand Sahjaddey being not denied and disputed, it was for the Appellants to \nshow that the defence version was probable; (iii) in view of the fact that both \nKhuddey and Laxmi Kant Srivastava were injured witnesses, their presence \nat the place of occurrence cannot be disputed and in that view of the matter \nthere is no reason as to why their testimonies should not be relied upon; and  \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">(iv) that from the First Information Report lodged by Kunwar Prahlad Singh, \nit would appear that the firing from a gun was admitted which being wholly \nunnatural would lead to an inference that the Appellants were the aggressors.  \nOur attention in this behalf has also been drawn to setting up of another \nstory by the Appellants in paragraph 9 of the S.L.P. which reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">&quot;\u0005As an altercation ensued, Khuddey attacked petitioner \nNo. 1 and 4.  Petitioner No. 1 and 4 wielded lathi in their \ndefence and a free fight ensued.  Prahlad Singh tried to \nescape by running away from the scene of occurrence but \nfrom one side, Dinesh Kumar aimed his gun at Prahlad \nSingh and from the other side, the brother of Khuddey \nnamely Nanhe confronted him.  Prahlad Singh sat down \nto avoid the bullet fearing a shot from the gun of Dinesh \nKumar and the bullet fired by Dinesh Kumar hit Nanhe \nand Nanhe died on the spot.&quot;\n</blockquote>\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\"> \tIt was submitted on the aforementioned premise that the \nAppellants  have raised defences which are mutually destructive. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">\tDrawing our attention to the findings of the learned Trial Judge as \nalso the High Court, it was argued that it is apparent that the accused persons \nwere the aggressors and in that view of the matter they cannot claim any \nright of private defence and in particular having regard to the fact that :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">(i) \tfrom the plot in question, wood had already been removed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">(ii)\tplace of occurrence is not the land in question but 300 paces away \ntherefrom.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">(iii)\tIf the version of the accused persons is to be accepted that somebody \nhas fired from behind, it cannot be said that they have done so in self-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">defence.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">(iv)\tSuch statements being vague no positive case of self-defence has been \nmade out.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\"> \tIt was submitted that in villages normally the servants carry a lathi \nand in that view of the matter it cannot be said that the accused persons came \nheavily armed.  Drawing our attention to the statements of Khuddey, PW-4 \nwherein he categorically admitted that Triloki and Sahdev received injuries \nfrom the lathi which he used in defence, it was submitted that in that view of \nthe matter it could be said that the prosecution did not come out with the \ntruth.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\"> \tAs regard, formation of common object, the learned counsel would \nsubmit that the same can be formed on the spot.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\">ADMITTED FACTS:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">\tThe admitted facts are:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">(i)\tThat the plot in dispute was in possession of accused Kunwar Prahlad \nSingh.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">(ii)\tThere are two factions in the village.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\">(iii)\tThe complainants were piling up wood on the occasion of Holi which \nwas removed by the accused persons.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">(iv)\tTwo persons on the side of the accused, viz., Triloki Nath, Sahdev \nsuffered lacerated wound on their heads.The said injuries were simple \nones.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">(v)\tNanhe died out of a gun shot injury.

At the \ntime of occurrence I did not see Triloki and Sahdev getting injured or \nbleeding.

His presence at the time of occurrence cannot be doubted as he was \ncited at one of the witnesses in the First Information Report which was \nrecorded within one and half hour from the time of occurrence.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">\tIt may be true that there appears to be some contradictions in his \nevidence as regard carrying of Laxmi Shankar on his back inasmuch as in \ncross-examination he had  stated Ram Shankar carried Laxmi Shankar on his \nback, but that by itself may not be a  ground to discard his evidence in \ntotality. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">\t&#x27;Falsus in uno, Falsus in ombibus&#x27; is not a rule of evidence in criminal \ntrial and it is the duty of the court to disengage the truth from falsehood, to \nsift the grain from the chaff.  \n</p>  \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_42\">The said First Information Report was lodged without any delay \nwhatsoever; particularly having regard to the fact that after the incident the \ninjured persons were required to be looked after and the distance of the \nPolice Station from the place of occurrence was about three kilometers.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">SELF-DEFENCE\n\tThe law relating to self defence in view of a catena of decisions of this \nCourt is now well-settled.  A plea of right of private defence  may be in \nrespect of property or a person.  <a href=\"/doc/650803/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 99</a> of the Indian Penal Code, \nhowever, mandates that the right of  private defence, in no case, extends to \ninflicting of more harm than  necessary.  <a href=\"/doc/714464/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 100</a> of the Code provides \nthat the right of private defence of the body extends  under the restrictions \nmentioned in <a href=\"/doc/650803/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 99</a> to the voluntary causing of death or of any other \nharm to the assailant if the offence which occasions the exercise of the right \nbe of any of the descriptions enumerated therein.   It is essential for an \naccused to show that there were circumstances giving rise to reasonable \ngrounds for apprehending that either death or grievous hurt would be caused \nto him, burden wherefor lies on him.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">\tIt is true that while exercising the right of private defence a person is \nnot expected to weigh in golden scales on the spur of the moment and in the \nheat of circumstances, the number of injuries required to disarm the assailant \nwho is armed with weapons; but it is also true that the right of private \ndefence cannot be exceeded so as to cause more harm than necessary.  \nCircumstances, thus, are required to be viewed with pragmatism.  It is also \nwell-settled that a right of private defnece is unavailable to the aggressor.  \nThe need to act must not have been created by the conduct of the accused in \nthe immediate context of the incident which was likely or intended to give \nrise to that need.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">\tIt is not necessary to dilate on the matter any further as in Bishna @ \nBhiswadeb Mahato &amp; Ors. vs. State of West Bengal [Criminal Appeal \nNos.1430-1431 of 2003], the issue has been discussed at some length.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">\tThe case at hand has to be considered having regard to the principles \nof law, as noticed hereinbefore.  We have seen that in what circumstances \nand to what extent the right of private defence can be exercise would depend \nupon the fact situation obtaining in each case.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\"> \tThe Appellants being in possession of the disputed land, were entitled \nto protect it but having regard to the past practice of performing Holika \nDahan on the land in question on the eve of Holi which takes place once in a \nyear, the complainants party evidently did not want to dispossess the \naccused persons permanently.  In law, however, the accused persons could \nresist trespass.  Even a trespass has been committed, in certain situations, \nright of private defence can be used to eject the trespassers.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">In this case, however, the incident took place 300 paces away from the \nland in question.  Laxmi Shankar Srivastava had gone to chakk.  At the time \nof occurrence he was coming back from his chakk.  It is, therefore, not \ncorrect to contend that he had sent the servant to the plot in question with a \nview to tease the Appellants and was waiting at some distance with others.  \nHe, therefore, could not have known any part of the occurrence which took \nplace till then. \n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_49\">According to the Appellants, they were attacked upon exhortation of \nLaxmi Shankar Srivastava.  As would be noticed from the discussions made \nhereinafter that the said stand of the Appellants cannot be said to be correct.   \nIt has not been shown that apart from Khuddey any other person was \ncarrying any weapon.  On the other hand, all the Appellants were armed with \nlathis except Jitendra who was carrying a gun.  There is no material on \nrecords to show that there had been any overt act on the part of the \ncomplainant.   In the above circumstances, it is unlikely that the complainant \nwould ask others to assault the Appellants.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\"> \tBoth the learned Sessions Judge and the High Court came to a \nconcurrent finding of fact that the incident took place after Khuddey was \nchased.  It is possible that as regard the right of the villagers to perform \nHolika Dahan or because of old enmity, the incident occurred but it is \nclearly not a case of free-fight amongst two groups of people, both  being \narmed with deadly weapons.  Thus, no case of self-defence has been made \nout. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_51\"> \tPW-4  categorically stated in his examination-in-chief that he used \nlathi in defence only after Gopal and Shashikant assaulted Laxmi Shankar \nSrivastava and Sahjaddey. In cross-examination, the said witness accepted \nthat Triloki and Sahjaddey received injuries from the lathi which he had \nused in defence, stating :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">&quot;\u0005I was shielding against the attack of the accused on \nmy lathi and was also making the attacks.  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">Approximately, I shielded against 2-4 blows of lathi.  In \ndefence I had attacked Triloki.  I had given one lathi \nblow.  I had made one attack with my lathi on Sahdev \nalso...&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\"> \tHe further categorically stated that none other than him and the \naccused had lathi/danda in their hands.  We find no reason to disbelieve his \ntestimony.\n</p>\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">\tThe Trial Court and the High Court have found that the nature of \ninjuries on the person of Triloki Nath and Sahdev were too trivial.  No case \nhas also been made out, as suggested, that Dinesh Kumar (PW-1) was armed \nwith a gun.  He was in fact not present at the time of incident.  No such \nsuggestion was given to him that he was present at the time of incident with \na gun.  Such a suggestion had not been given also to any other witness.  \nNon-sustenance of any injury by Khuddey is also not of  much significance.  \nHe in his evidence, as noticed hereinbefore, has clearly stated as to why he \nhad to wield lathi and how he had been defending himself and had been able \nto hit blows on Sahdev and Triloki Nath.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">\tIn the First Information Report lodged by Kunwar Prahlad Singh, it is \nalleged that they had run away when a sound of gun fire was heard.  It is \ninteresting to note that as regard the said incident, Dinesh Kumar was also \nsaid to have lodged a First Information Report but the same was not brought \non record.     \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_55\"> \tWe have noticed hereinbefore that even in the First Information \nReport it has been admitted that the accused persons had also received \ninjuries as a lathi was wielded.  PW-3 although stated that he had not seen at \nthe time of occurrence Triloki or Sahdev getting injured but he accepted that \n&quot;May be that the lathi used by Khuddey hit Triloki&quot;.  Merely a suggestion \nwas given to PW-3 on behalf of the Appellants that Triloki Nath and Sahdev \ntried to mediate between the two groups and after they started beating \nTriloki Nath and Sahdev with lathi and in the melee Triloki Nath and Sahdev \nin turn assaulted others, but  the same was denied. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">ANALYSIS OF EVIDENCE\n\tThe prosecution has fully established that Khuddey while going to the \nfloor mill found the Appellants herein removing the wood, and asked them \nnot to do so.  He was, of course, armed with a lathi.   Khuddey at that time, \nthus, was not causing any trespass. He did not physically prevent the \nAppellants from removing the trees.  He even did not prevent them from \nreentering or otherwise obstructing them physically from possessing the \nland.  He was chased away.  He came near the Hata of Pran which is about \n300 paces away from Plot No.399.  At that point of time in all probabilities  \nLaxmi Shankar Srivastava (PW-3) and Sahjadey, (PW-2), Shabbir and other \npersons arrived there.  Laxmi Shankar Srivastava had only asked the \nAppellants as to why they had been chasing his servant, whereupon Triloki \nNath exhorted his companions to assault him resulting in the incident.  If  \nKhoddey&#x27;s evidence is believed, he had used his lathi to prevent assault on \nhis master.  He had used his lathi both by way of defnece as well as \nassaulting two of the accused parties.  The right of private defence in the \naforementioned situation could not have been exercised for preventing \ntrespass into the property or for evicting the trespassers.  By the time \nKhuddey reached near the land,  the Appellants were already in possession \nof the land as they had removed the wood, which had been placed on the \nland by the complainant party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1389848\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"922643\" id=\"span_2\">The Appellants, therefore, were aggressors.  The right of private \ndefence cannot, thus, be claimed by them.  [See  <a href=\"/doc/922643/\" id=\"a_16\">Munney Khan vs. State of \nMadhya Pradesh</a> (1971) 1 SCR 943]\n\n\tIn <a href=\"/doc/1389848/\" id=\"a_17\">A.C.Gangadhar vs. State of Karnataka</a> [AIR 1998 SC 2381], the \nAppellant was said to have caused an injury with an axe on the head of PW-\n5 when they  protested against the accused from cutting the tree.  The right \nof private defence claimed by the accused was denied opining :</span></span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">&quot;3. The learned counsel for the appellant, however, \nsubmitted that even if it is believed that A-1 had caused \ngrievous hurt, he could not have been held guilty either \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 326</a> or for any other offence as the said \ninjury was caused by him in exercise of the right of \nprivate defence. Both the courts have come to the \nconclusion that the accused and his companions were the \naggressors and had started the assault on the deceased \nand his children and that too, because they protested \nagainst the accused cutting the tree. Therefore, there was \nno scope for giving any benefit of right of private \ndefence to the appellant. We, therefore, see no reason to \ninterfere with the order passed by the High Court\u0005&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"714537\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/714537/\" id=\"a_19\">Rajesh Kumar  vs. Dharamvir and Others</a> [(1997) 4 SCC 496], it is \nstated :</span> \n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">&quot;20. <a href=\"/doc/777353/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 96</a> of the Indian Penal Code provides that \nnothing is an offence which is done in the exercise of the \nright of private defence and the fascicle of <a href=\"/doc/1499794/\" id=\"a_21\">Sections 97</a> to \n<a href=\"/doc/1606852/\" id=\"a_22\">106</a> thereof lays down the extent and limitation of such \nright. From a plain reading of the above sections it is \nmanifest that such a right can be exercised only to repel \nunlawful aggression and not to retaliate. To put it \ndifferently, the right is one of defence and not of requital \nor reprisal. Such being the nature of right, the High Court \ncould not have exonerated the accused persons of the \ncharges levelled against them by bestowing on them the \nright to retaliate and attack the complainant party.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">\tTherein, the prosecution case was as under : \n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">&quot;3. According to the prosecution case on the same \nday at or about 4.30 p.m. the five accused and Lachhi \nRam started demolishing the inner boundary wall of the \nshop in order to make it a part of their own house. On \nhearing the sound of pounding on the wall Yogesh went \nto the lane in front of their house and asked the accused \nnot to demolish the wall. Immediately thereafter accused \nDharamvir, armed with a lathi, and the other four accused \nand Lachhi Ram came out of the shop with knives and \nstarted inflicting blows on Yogesh with their respective \nweapons. On hearing the alarms raised by him when \nRajesh (PW 13), his father Dinesh Chander, and his \ngrandfather Suraj Bhan came forward to his rescue, \nSubhash, Lachhi Ram and Suresh, assaulted Rajesh with \ntheir knives. All the five accused persons and Lachhi \nRam also assaulted Dinesh Chander and Suraj Bhan \ncausing injuries on their person. At that stage, Dinesh \nChander fired a shot from his licensed gun, which hit \nLachhi Ram. In the meantime Krishna Devi (PW 14), \nmother of Rajesh, had also reached the spot. Thereafter \nthe five accused persons ran away with their weapons. \nThough Yogesh had succumbed to his injuries there, his \nbody was taken to the Local Primary Health Centre, \nwhere the injured Dinesh Chander, Suraj Bhan and \nLachhi Ram were removed for treatment. The injured \nRajesh however first went to Samalkha Police Station to \nlodge the FIR.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">The Trial Court recorded a finding relying upon the evidence of Rajesh \nKumar (PW-13) and his mother Krishna Devi (PW-14) that the entire \noccurrence took place in the lane itself.  The said finding was upset by the \nHigh Court accepting the plea of right of private defence  of person and \nproperty raised by the accused persons in the manner as noticed supra.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\"> \tThis Court held :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">&quot;21. We reach the same conclusion through a \ndifferent route even if we proceed on the assumption that \nthe finding of the High Court that the accused party came \nout in the lane and attacked the complainant party after \nthe latter had damaged the outer door of their house is a \nproper one. The offence that was committed by the \ncomplainant party by causing such damage would \namount to &quot;mischief&quot; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/441951/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 425</a> \nof the Indian Penal Code and, therefore, in view of \n<a href=\"/doc/1944062/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 105</a> of the Indian Penal Code the accused would \nhave been entitled to exercise their right of private \ndefence of property so long as the complainant party \ncontinued in the commission of the mischief. In other \nwords, after the damage was done, the accused had no \nright of private defence of property, which necessarily \nmeans that when they attacked the complainant party in \nthe lane they were the aggressors. Consequently, it was \nthe complainant party \u0017 and not the accused \u0017 who was \nentitled to exercise the right of private defence of their \npersons; and their act of gunning down Lachhi after four \nof them were assaulted by the accused party with deadly \nweapons would not be an offence in view of <a href=\"/doc/777353/\" id=\"a_25\">Sections 96</a> \nand <a href=\"/doc/714464/\" id=\"a_26\">100</a> of the Indian Penal Code\u0005&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7465\" id=\"span_4\">In <a href=\"/doc/7465/\" id=\"a_27\">Mannu and others Vs.

In other words, \nan assembly of five or more persons actuated by, and \nentertaining one or more of the common object specified \nby the five clauses of <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 141</a>, is an unlawful \nassembly. The crucial question to determine in such a \ncase is whether the assembly consisted of five or more \npersons and whether the said persons entertained one or \nmore of the common objects as specified by <a href=\"/doc/1542085/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 141</a>. \nWhile determining this question, it becomes relevant to \nconsider whether the assembly consisted of some persons \nwho were merely passive witnesses and had joined the \nassembly as a matter of idle curiosity without intending \nto entertain the common object of the assembly\u0005&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\"> \tIt was further observed:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">&quot;In fact, <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 149</a> makes it clear that if an offence is \ncommitted by any member of an unlawful assembly in \nprosecution of the common object of that assembly, or \nsuch as the members of that assembly knew to be likely \nto be committed in prosecution of that object, every \nperson who, at the time of the committing of that offence, \nis a member of the same assembly, is guilty of that \noffence; and that emphatically brings out the principle \nthat the punishment prescribed by <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 149</a> is in a \nsense vicarious and does not always proceed on the basis \nthat the offence has been actually committed by every \nmember of the unlawful assembly.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_84\"> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"243070\" id=\"span_21\">Yet again in <a href=\"/doc/243070/\" id=\"a_60\">Bhajan Singh and Others Vs.

It is necessary for \nconstitution of the offence that the object should be \ncommon to the persons who compose the assembly, that \nis, that they should all be aware of it and concur in  it.   \nFurthermore, there must be some present and immediate \npurpose of carrying into effect the common object.  A \ncommon object is different from a common intention \ninsofar as in the former no prior consent is required, nor a \nprior meeting of minds before the attack would be \nrequired whereas an unlawful object can develop after \nthe people get there and there need not be a prior meeting \nof minds.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\"> \t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"493248\" id=\"span_23\">In  <a href=\"/doc/493248/\" id=\"a_64\">Ram Tahal and Others Vs.

The underlying principle \nbehind the said provision is joint liability of persons in \ndoing of a criminal act which must have found in the \nexistence of common intention of enmity in the acts in \ncommitting the criminal act in furtherance thereof.  The \nlaw in this behalf is no longer res integra.  There need not \nbe a positive overt act on the part of the person \nconcerned.  Even an omission on his part to do something \nmay attract the said provision.  But it is beyond any cavil \nof doubt that the question must be answered having \nregard to the fact situation obtaining in each case.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">CONCLUSION\n\tThe upshot of our aforementioned discussions is that the Appellants \nwere not entitled to raise the plea of self-defence both in respect of the \nproperty as also the person being themselves aggressors.  The fact that the \nprosecution in the counter-case lodged by Kunwar Prahlad Singh has \nresulted in acquittal of the complainant party would also have some bearing \nin the matter.  We have also found hereinbefore that injuries on the person of \nTriloki Nath and Sahdev had sufficiently been explained.  The injuries on \nthe person of the said Appellants, therefore, loses all significance.\n \tWe, therefore, do not agree with the submissions of the learned \ncounsel for the Appellants that the prosecution has come out only with a half \ntruth.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\"> \tFor the purpose of arriving at a finding of guilt of the Appellants, the \nnumber of shots fired by Jitendra would not be decisive.  Carrying of a lathi \nby Khuddey who was responsible for causing injury on Trilokinath and \nSahdev has sufficiently been explained by the learned Sessions Judge as also \nthe High Court and we do not find any reason to differ therefrom.  Similarly, \nnon-sufferance of any injury by Khuddey is also not of much significance so \nas to tilt the balance in favour of the Appellants.  It is equally incorrect to \ncontend that no unlawful assembly could have been caused unless Khuddey \nwas assaulted.  Such a plea, in our opinion, is wholly misconceived.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\"> \tWe are furthermore of the opinion that non-examination of Sahdev is \nnot fatal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_91\">\tMr. Bajawa, the learned Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the \nAppellants laid emphasis on the fact that blackening, tattooing and scorching \nwere found, the same could not have been caused from a double barrel \nmuzzle loaded gun which was said to the weapon of offence.  The said \ncontention had not been raised before the Trial Court or before the High \nCourt.   Even the attention of  the doctor (PW-5) was not drawn to this \naspect of the matter.   Had the doctor been confronted with such a plea, as \nhas been raised before us,  he might have explained the same.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">In this case having regard to the peculiar facts and circumstances of \nthis case, we are of the opinion that the Appellants and the other accused \ncannot be said to have formed a common object to kill any person, or to \nmake an attempt in that behalf in view of the manner in which the \noccurrence took place.  Their common object appears to be  to teach Laxmi \nShankar Srivastava and others, a lesson for making attempts to burn Holika \nby causing grievous injuries to them\n\nThe prosecution has been able to establish that on mere asking of \nLaxmi Shankar Srivastava as to why the other accused had been chasing his \nservant, Triloki exhorted his companions saying &#x27;Maro Sale Ko&#x27;,  \nwhereupon  Gopal hurled a lathi blow on PW-3&#x27;s head.  Shashi Kant  gave \nthe second lathi blow on his wrist.  Kunwar Prahlad Singh and Sahdev also \nassaulted him with lathis, whereas Chhanga and Krishna assaulted Sahjadey.  \nThus, their common object to cause grievous hurt to some persons on the \nside of the complainant party is established.  We are, therefore, of the \nopinion that all the accused persons including Jitendra are to be found guilty \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_72\">149</a> IPC.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_93\">In the aforementioned premise, a significant aspect of the matter \ncannot be lost sight of.  Only Triloki exhorted Jitendra to kill Nanhe who \ncame to the spot accidentlly.  The exhortation of Triloki was to Jitendra @ \nMister,  who was having a gun.  On his exhortation only Jitendra fired from \nhis gun as a result whereof, he died.  We, therefore, are of the opinion that \nTriloki along with Jitendra developed a common intention in that behalf on \nthe spot.  Both are, therefore, liable to be convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_74\">34</a> \nIPC. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_94\">The sentence imposed by the High Court on Jitendra is, therefore, \nmaintained.  The conviction of other appellants is altered to one under \n<a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 326</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_76\">149</a> IPC.
