On 06.08.1982 Mariam disappeared from the village \nalong with A-7. They proceeded to Bombay and got married on \n15.08.1982. They returned to village Halbudruk six days before the \nincident. There was tension between the two groups in the village, \ni.e., Bedekars (accused persons) and Jalgaonkars (the members of \nprosecution party) on account of their said love affair but the matter \nwas settled. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.\tFurther prosecution case was that on 27.8.1982 Salma \nUsman Dhanse [PW-12] had spread rice on the road in front of her \nhouse for drying. She had asked her daughter Parvin to sit and \nwatch the same. Parvin, however, went out for playing which \nannoyed Salma and she scolded Parvin. Parvin sulked and sat in the \nsun. Salma told her that like the rice she would also get dried up \nwhich would be good for her as her fat would melt in that way. \nHajirabai [A-16], who was living in the vicinity, thought that Salma \nhad made those remarks against her, as such she picked up a \nquarrel with Salma. On 28.8.1982 when Usman Abdul Rahiman \nDhanse [PW-3], husband of Salma, was coming to his house, A-16 \naccosted him and conveyed her grievance against Salma. PW-3 \nexplained to her that those remarks were directed towards Parvin \nand not her. As A-16 was not satisfied with the explanation, A-4, A-5, \nA-12 and A-13 came to the house of PW-12 and abused her and her \nhusband [PW-3]. When Nijam Malang Mukadam [PW-4], brother of \nPW-12, enquired as to why they were quarrelling, the four accused \npersons also abused and threatened him.  PW-3 and PW-4 went to \nIsmail (since deceased) for advice as he was an elderly person in the \nvillage. Some other prosecution witnesses were also sitting in the \nhouse of Ismail who advised PW-3 and PW-4 not to quarrel but to \nlodge a complaint with the police. Upon their request Ismail \naccompanied them to the police station and all the three went on \ncycles. On their way to the police station they took Hussain Karjikar, \nbrother-in-law of PW-4, along with them. Hussain advised PW-3 and \nPW-4 to go to Khalapur Police Station and lodge a complaint. \nHussain and Ismail waited on the road. PW-3 and PW-4 reached the \npolice station and lodged a First Information Report [&#x27;FIR&#x27; for short] \nagainst A-4, A-5, A-12 and A-13 on the statement of PW-3. In view of \nthe said case, Head Constable-S.D. Pawar [PW-37], in-charge of the \npolice station, sent Jamadar\u0016Pasthe by jeep to village Hal Budruk to \nbring the accused persons to the police station. A-4, A-5, A-12 and \nA-13 were brought to the police station by police jeep. The other \naccused persons, i.e., A-1, A-3, A-6, A-9 and A-11 also arrived at the \npolice station. The police warned the accused persons not to commit \nbreach of peace. A-9, who was also police Patel of the village, \npromised to bring both the parties to the police station at 7 a.m. next \nday. The Police obtained a written undertaking from the parties to \nthe above effect.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.\tAccording to the prosecution, accused persons left the police \nstation by auto rickshaw whereas PW-3 and PW-4 on their cycles in \nthe midnight of 28-29.8.1982 and on their way they took Ismail with \nthem. By about 12:00 or 12:30 of the same midnight, the relatives of \nIsmail became concerned because he did not return to the village. \nTherefore, Badruddin Pechker, Ibrahim and Yunus Jalgaonkar and \nothers decided to go and search for him. They reached hotel Delhi \nDurbar and decided to have tea and wait there for Ismail. PW-3 and \nPW-4 along with Ismail reached hotel Delhi Durbar where Badruddin \nand all others were waiting. All of them had tea in the hotel and left \nfor the village between 2:00 to 2:30 in the midnight. PW-4 was ahead \nof others, since he had to go to Bombay for purchasing fish in \nconnection with his business. Ismail was following him. Usman \nYunus and Badruddin lagged behind for smoking. All the accused \npersons armed with swords, iron bars and sticks were waiting near a \nwell for the return of the Jalgaonkars, i.e., the members of \nprosecution party. A-1 to A-5, A-8 and A-10 were armed with swords.  \nWhen PW-4 arrived near the tamarind tree, the accused persons \nstopped and blamed him for going to the police station and lodging a \ncase. The accused persons thereafter became abusive and started \nhurling harsh words against him. PW-4 was on his cycle. A-1 tried to \nhit PW-4 in his stomach with the sword he was holding. PW-4 \navoided the blow but was hit on the left side of the abdomen. At this \nstage Ismail was seen coming behind him. Therefore, the accused \npersons turned towards Ismail. In the meanwhile, PW-4 escaped and \nreached the house of Ismail, called Abdul Qadir, son of Ismail, and \ntold him that Ismail was being beaten up by the accused persons. \nAnother son of Ismail, Shaikh Mohammad, also heard PW-4 saying \nso.  Ismail came to be attacked near the tamarind tree. A-1, A-2, A-3, \nA-4 and A-10 dealt sword blows on the head of Ismail. PW-4, while \ngoing to his house, met PW-12 on the way who in turn enquired \nabout her husband [PW-3] as he had not returned along with him. \nHaving learnt about the incident from PW-4, she started towards the \nplace of occurrence. Likewise, PW-2 as well as Yusuf proceeded \ntowards the place of occurrence. While Ismail was being hit, Suleman \nreached near him and tried to save him from the accused persons. A-\n1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and A-10 struck Suleman with their swords over his \nhead. Some other accused also joined them. The prosecution \nwitnesses, who tried to intervene, were also assaulted. By this time \nYusuf also reached there who was also attacked by A-2, A-3, A-5 and \nA-10 as a result of which he fell down. In the meantime PW-12 also \nreached there and was also assaulted by some of the accused.  When \nthis was going on, PW-2 thought of reporting the matter to the police \nand accordingly, he came to the Bombay-Pune road, boarded a taxi, \nreached Khalapur Police Station and informed the Station In-charge, \nShivaji Dhondu Pawar [PW-37] at 2:45 in the night that A-1 was \nmoving with a sword in the village and was indulging in massacre \nand there was great commotion in the village.  Sub-Inspector, \nMadhav Bajirao Malve [PW-39], who was present in the police \nstation, left for the place of occurrence where statement of PW-2 was \nrecorded at 3:15 in the midnight, on the basis of which an FIR was \ndrawn up at the police station on 29.08.1982.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">5.\tPolice after registering the case took up investigation and on \ncompletion thereof submitted charge sheet, on receipt whereof the \nlearned Magistrate took cognizance and committed the seventeen \naccused persons to the Court of Sessions to face trial.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">6.\tDefence of the accused persons was that they were innocent, \nhad no complicity with the crime and no occurrence much less the \noccurrence alleged had taken place. According to the accused \npersons, some of them and members of prosecution party had \nreceived injuries in some other manner of occurrence at some other \nplace, but they were falsely implicated in the case on hand.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">7.\tDuring trial the prosecution examined several witnesses and \non conclusion of the same, Trial Court acquitted all the accused \npersons but on appeal being preferred High Court partly reversed the \norder of acquittal and convicted eight accused persons as stated \nabove. Criminal Appeal No. 9 of 2001 has been filed by A-5, A-6 and \nA-11 and Criminal Appeal No. 504 of 2000 by A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4 and \nA-10, whereas, Criminal Appeal No. 60 of 2001 has been filed by the \ninformant in which leave has been granted in relation to that portion \nof judgment of the High Court whereby it has confirmed acquittal of \nA-5, A-6 and A-11 in relation to the charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 302</a> IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">8.\tShri Shekhar Naphade, the learned senior counsel appearing \non behalf of the appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 504 of 2000, in \nsupport of the appeal, submitted that the prosecution failed to prove \nits case and participation of the appellants in the crime by credible \nevidence. Shri S.K. Aggrawal, learned senior counsel appearing on \nbehalf of the appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 9 of 2001, submitted \nthat the High Court was not justified in convicting A-5, A-6 and A-11 \nunder <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_19\">Sections 148</a> and <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_20\">324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_21\">149</a> IPC. Learned counsel then \nsubmitted that out of these appellants, A-5 and A-6 have already \nundergone the sentences imposed upon them and have been released \nfrom custody, but so far as A-11 is concerned, he has remained in \ncustody for a period of 15 months, as such the sentences of \nimprisonment awarded against him should be reduced to the period \nalready undergone.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">9.\tOn the other hand, Shri Ravindra Keshavrao Adsure, learned \ncounsel appearing on behalf of the State of Maharashtra, submitted \nthat the High Court was quite justified in reversing the order of \nacquittal as the same was perverse and convicting the appellants of \nCriminal Appeal No. 504 of 2000 and Criminal Appeal No. 9 of 2001.  \nShri A.K. Ganguli, learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the \ncomplainant-appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 60 of 2001 submitted \nthat no interference is called for with the conviction of accused \npersons and the High Court was not justified in affirming the \nacquittal of A-5, A-6 and A-11 of the charge under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 302</a> IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">10.\tIn the present case the prosecution examined thirteen \neyewitnesses, out of whom, eleven were injured witnesses. The \nwitnesses can be put into four categories. In the first category the \nprosecution examined Abdul Kadir Ismail Jalgaonkar [PW-6], Mohd. \nSwale Yusuf Jalgaonkar [PW-13] and Badrudin Pechkar [PW-14]. \nThese witnesses claimed that they received injuries during the course \nof the occurrence but in support of the same no medical evidence has \nbeen produced. As such their evidence has been rightly discarded by \nthe Trial Court as well as the High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">11.\tIn the second category Nizam Mukadam [PW-4], Mohd. Hanif \nSuleman [PW-5] and Abdul Latif Lalumiya Jalgaonkar [PW-9] were \nexamined, who also claimed to be injured eyewitnesses and in \nsupport of their claim medical evidence has been produced, but the \nTrial Court, upon threadbare discussion of the evidence, came to the \nconclusion that their evidence was not corroborated by medical \nevidence produced by the prosecution, as such, it was not safe to \nplace reliance thereupon. We have been taken through the evidence \nof these witnesses and we are of the view that the Trial Court was \nquite justified in not relying upon the evidence of these witnesses \nand the High Court was not right in placing reliance upon them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">12.\tIn the third category Yunus Ismail Jalgaonkar [PW-7], \nShaikh Mohd. Lalumiya Jalgaonkar [PW-8], Abdul Latif Abdul \nRahaman Dhanse [PW-11], Salma Usman Dhanse [PW-12] and \nUsman Hasanmiya Jalgaonkar [PW-19] were examined, who were \ninjured witnesses and their evidence is corroborated by medical \nevidence. PW-7 is son of deceased Ismail. He stated that A-4 and A-\n10 assaulted deceased Ismail with sword on the head and A-1 and A-\n4 inflicted injuries with sword on the head of deceased Suleman. A-6 \ninflicted two blows with iron bar on the shoulder of this witness, \nwhereas A-10 inflicted injury with sword on his shoulder. The \nevidence of this witness of inflicting sword injuries upon deceased \nIsmail, deceased Suleman and this witness is corroborated by \nmedical evidence. His evidence in Court is consistent with statement \nmade by him before the Police and supported by medical evidence. As \nsuch, we do not find any ground to disbelieve him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">13.\tNext witness was PW-8, who is brother of deceased Yusuf. He \nstated that A-2, A-3 and A-10 inflicted injuries with sword upon \ndeceased Yusuf. The witness further stated that when he tried to \nintervene, A-4 asked others to finish him and thereupon A-3, A-5 \nand A-10 assaulted him with sword whereas A-9 [against whom \nappeal abated before the High Court on account of his death] \ninflicted injury upon him with iron bar. The evidence of this witness \nis supported by the medical evidence of deceased Yusuf as well as \nthis witness. His statement in Court is in conformity with the \nstatement made by him before the Police. As such, it is not possible \nto reject his evidence, especially, when the same is corroborated by \nmedical evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">14.\tAnother injured eyewitness was PW-11, who is also related to \nthe members of the prosecution party. He stated that A-1 and A-2 \ninflicted injuries with sword upon deceased Yusuf and others \nassaulted him with iron bar. He further stated that A-5 assaulted \nthis witness with a sword. The medical evidence of deceased Yusuf \nand that of PW-11 corroborates the statement of this witness. His \nevidence is not only supported by his statement made before the \nPolice but medical evidence as well.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">15.\tThe next injured eyewitness was PW-12. Deceased Yusuf was \nhusband of the sister of this witness. She stated that A-1, A-2 and A-\n10 assaulted deceased Yusuf with sword. This witness was assaulted \non the head by A-8 [against whom appeal abated before the High \nCourt on account of his death] and A-15 since acquitted. The \nevidence of this witness is also supported by her statement made \nbefore the Police as well as medical evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">16.\tLast witness in this category was PW-19, who is brother of \ndeceased Ismail. He stated that A-1, A-2 and A-3 assaulted deceased \nYusuf with sword. The witness further stated that when he tried to \nintervene he was assaulted with iron bar by A-9 [against whom \nappeal abated before the High Court] and A-11. The statement of this \nwitness is consistent with his statement made before Police and \ncorroborated by medical evidence of deceased Yusuf and this \nwitness.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">17.\tThe learned counsel for the appellants submitted that no \nreliance should be placed upon the evidence of PWs 7, 8, 11, 12 and \n19 as all of them are related to members of the prosecution party. It \nis well-settled that in a criminal trial merely because a witness is \ninterested his evidence cannot be discarded if the same is otherwise \nfound to be credible. In the present case, as we have come to the \nconclusion that the evidence of these witnesses is consistent and \ncorroborated by medical evidence it is not possible to discard the \nsame on the ground that they were interested persons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">18.\tIn the last category Mohd. Usman Mandlekar [PW-10] and \nUsman Mohd. Kasim Duduke [PW-15] were examined, who were \nindependent eyewitnesses, though not injured. PW-10 stated that A-\n2, A-3 and A-10 inflicted injuries upon the head of deceased Yusuf \nwith sword, A-6 with a stick and A-9 [whose appeal abated before the \nHigh Court on account of his death] with iron bar. The evidence of \nthis witness is corroborated by medical evidence of deceased Yusuf. \nHe was examined by the Police at the earliest point of time, i.e., on \nthe next day of the occurrence. The witness supported the \nprosecution case in all material particulars. His statement in Court is \nconsistent with statement made before the Police and the same is \nsupported by medical evidence of deceased Yusuf, as such we do not \nfind any reason to disbelieve him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">19.\tNext independent eyewitness was PW-15. He stated that A-2, \nA-3, A-4 and A-10 assaulted deceased Ismail with sword. He further \nstated that A-1 and A-4 inflicted injuries with sword upon deceased \nSuleman. This witness was examined on 31.8.1982, i.e., only two \ndays after the occurrence. His evidence in Court is consistent with \nstatement made by him before the Police and medical evidence of \ndeceased Ismail and Suleman. The witness has also supported the \nprosecution case in all material particulars and we do not find any \nground to discard him.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">20.\tShri Shekhar Naphade, learned senior counsel submitted \nthat in the present case some of the accused persons received \ninjuries and the prosecution failed to explain the same. It is true that \nA-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, A-5, A-12 and A-13 were examined by Dr. Shivaji \nTukaram Barphe [PW-28] on 30.8.1982 who found injuries on their \nperson. PW 28 stated that all the injuries found on the aforesaid \naccused persons were simple and minor. He further stated that the \ninjuries were possible by accidental blows from accused upon \nthemselves while they were attacking some other persons. From the \naforesaid statement of PW-28 it cannot be said that the minor and \nsimple injuries on the accused persons have not been explained by \nthe prosecution. It is well-settled that if injuries on the defence are \nnot explained by the prosecution, the same may be taken to be a \nground to discard the prosecution case, in case the truthfulness of  \nprosecution case is otherwise doubted. But, in cases like the present \none, where there is consistent evidence of the injured eyewitnesses \napart from evidence of independent eyewitnesses, even if it is \nassumed that the prosecution has failed to explain the minor and \nsimple injuries on the defence, the same cannot be taken to be a \nground to reject the testimony of such witnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">21.\tLearned counsel for the appellants next submitted that on \nthe basis of statement of PW-2 Station Diary Entry [Exhibit 72] was \nmade at the police station in the night of the occurrence at 2:45 a.m. \nwhich was the earliest version of the occurrence wherein neither \nnames of any of the three deceased persons nor names of any of the \ninjured persons nor names of any of the accused persons, excepting \nA-1, were mentioned, and after due deliberation at 3:15 a.m. an FIR \nwas lodged, which is Exhibit 27, in which names of all the accused \npersons were mentioned.  From the Station Diary Entry [Ex. 72], it \nappears that there was some commotion in the village and in order to \ncontrol the situation PW-2 rushed to the police station and he had \nnot seen any occurrence. Undisputedly, by the time PW-2 went back \nto the village the entire occurrence was over. It appears that this \nwitness had not seen any of the accused persons assaulting either \nany of the deceased persons or any of the injured witnesses and the \nclaim in the FIR [Ex. 27] that he witnessed the actual assault is an \nexaggeration. His evidence in Court that he witnessed the assault on \ndeceased Suleman and Ismail besides injured witnesses is also an \nexaggerated version, as such the same cannot be relied upon. It is \ntrue that names of the accused persons other than A-1 were not \nmentioned in the Station Diary Entry [Ex. 72], which was earliest \nversion of the occurrence, PW 2 cannot be said to be an eyewitness to \nthe actual assault and his evidence to this effect is not trustworthy, \nbut the same cannot be a ground to reject consistent evidence of \ninjured eyewitnesses and independent eyewitnesses, more so, when \ntheir evidence is corroborated by medical evidence of the three \ndeceased persons and the injured eyewitnesses.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">22.\tSo far as the convictions of A-5, A-6 and A-11 under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_23\">Sections \n148</a> and <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_24\">324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_25\">149</a> IPC are concerned, the High Court has placed \nreliance upon the evidence of PWs 7, 8, 11 and 19. So far as A-5 is \nconcerned, he has been named by two injured eyewitnesses viz., PWs \n8 and 11. A-6 has been named by injured eyewitness PW 7. A-11 has \nbeen named by another injured eyewitness PW 19. These witnesses \nhave made consistent statements and their evidence is corroborated \nby medical evidence. In our view High Court was quite justified in \nconvicting them under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_26\">Sections 148</a> and <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_27\">324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_28\">149</a> IPC. As A-11 has \nremained in custody for a period of 15 months, in our view, ends of \njustice would be met in case the sentences of imprisonment awarded \nagainst him under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_29\">Sections 148</a> and <a href=\"/doc/724142/\" id=\"a_30\">324</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_31\">149</a> IPC are reduced to the \nperiod already undergone. So far as charges under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_33\">149</a> \nIPC and 302 read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 34</a> IPC framed against A-5, A-6 and A-\n11 are concerned, we are of the view that the order of acquittal of \nthese appellants of the aforesaid charges recorded by the Trial Court \ncannot be said to be perverse as such the High Court was quite \njustified in refusing to interfere with the same. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">23.\tIn view of the foregoing discussions we are of the view that \nthe High Court was quite justified in convicting A-1, A-2, A-3, A-4, A-\n5, A-6, A-10 and A-11 but the sentences of imprisonment awarded \nagainst A-11 should be reduced to the period already undergone. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">24.\tIn the result, Criminal Appeal No. 9 of 2001 is allowed in part \nand while maintaining convictions of appellants of this appeal, the \nsentences of imprisonment awarded against A-11 are reduced to the \nperiod already undergone.
