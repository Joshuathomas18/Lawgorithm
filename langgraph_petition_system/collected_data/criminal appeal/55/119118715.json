Being aggrieved by the acquittal of Balkar Singh  (A-4),  Ranbir\nSingh (A-6) and Charan       Singh (A-8), State of Haryana and Chanda  Singh\n– father of the deceased Narinder Singh have preferred Criminal Appeal  Nos.\n826/2010 and 830/2010.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_3\">2.          Briefly stated  case  of  the  prosecution  is  that    deceased\nNarinder Singh was running a shop for the sale of fertilizers at  the  Ladwa\nTown and he was residing near Veterinary Hospital.  On  22.8.1998  at  about\n8.45 p.m. Narinder Singh  was driving his motor cycle  and  when  he  turned\ntowards  Babain Road, in Ladwa  little ahead  of  the  veterinary  hospital,\nDilawar Singh (A-1), Gurdev  Singh  (A-2)  and  Yash  Pal  (A-3)  and  other\naccused persons  namely Balkar Singh (A-4), Ashok Kumar (A-5)  Ranbir  Singh\n(A-6), Shamsher Singh  (A-7),  Charan  Singh  (A-8)  and  Dalbir  Singh(A-9)\nintercepted him.  Dilawar Singh (A-1), Yash Pal (A-3) and Shamsher Singh (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">7) gave blow on the head of deceased Narinder Singh  with  their  respective\ncutter and Narinder Singh fell down along with his motor cycle  and  shouted\nBachao Bachao. At that time Chanda Singh-father of the deceased  along  with\nhis brother Hakam Singh came nearby in  their  car   and   saw  the  accused\nbeing attacked.  Chanda Singh and Hakam Singh cried  for  help  and  shouted\n‘NA MARO NA MARO’.  Gurdev Singh (A-2) and Charan Singh (A-8)  caused  sword\nblows on the  left leg and right leg of Narinder Singh.  Ranbir Singh  (A-6)\ngave gandasi blow on the right hand of Narinder Singh whereas  Balkar  Singh\n(A-4) gave gandasi blow to Narinder  Singh  on  his  left  arm.   Two  other\nassailants  namely  Ashok  Kumar  (A-5)  and  Dalbir  Singh  (A-9)  attacked\nNarinder Singh with hockey sticks and caused  injuries  to  Narinder  Singh.\nIn the meanwhile, Sham Singh (PW-7) also reached there and  he  too  shouted\nat the accused not to kill Narinder Singh.  All the accused  fled away  from\nthe spot with their respective  weapons  in  their   motor  cycles.   Chanda\nSingh (PW-6), Hakam Singh and Sham Singh (PW-7)  chased  the  assailants  in\ntheir respective vehicles but they could not catch hold of  them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.          Further case of prosecution is that on 22.8.1998 at  about  9.00\np.m. ASI Charan Dass (PW-11) who was on  patrolling  duty  received  message\nabout an injured person lying near Veterinary Hospital, Ladwa and PW-11  and\npolice party went to the scene of occurrence and  shifted  injured  Narinder\nSingh to Community Health Centre, Ladwa  where  Dr.  Ashwini  Kumar  (DW-1),\nMedical Officer  of the Health Centre examined him and found him not fit  to\nmake  statement. In the meanwhile, Chanda Singh and Hakam Singh reached  the\nspot and found that injured Narinder Singh had already been shifted  to  the\nhospital by the police.   Chanda Singh (PW-6) went  to  the  Ladwa  Hospital\nand Hakam Singh went to the   village  to  inform  the  family  members   of\nNarinder Singh  about the incident.  When  Chanda  Singh  reached  Community\nHealth Centre at Ladwa, injured Narinder Singh was, in the process of  being\nreferred  to  the  Lok  Nayak  Jai  Prakash  Hospital,  Kurukshetra  as  his\ncondition  was  very   serious.   In  the  hospital  at   Kurukshetra,   Dr.\nS.C.Grover (PW-1)  examined  the  injured–Narinder  Singh  and  opined  that\nNarinder Singh was unfit to make any  statement.   Since  the  condition  of\nNarinder Singh was serious, he was immediately referred  to  PGI  Chandigarh\nand Chanda Singh shifted injured Narinder  Singh  to  PGI  Chandigarh.   Dr.\nMunish Kumar (PW-9)  of  PGI  Chandigarh  admitted  Narinder  Singh  in  the\nhospital on 23.8.1998 at about 2.30 a.m. and  intimation  was sent   to  the\npolice post located near the hospital. On receipt of  information  from  the\nhospital,  ASI  Karam  Chand  (PW-4)  went  to  the  hospital  and  on   his\napplication  Dr. Kanya Rejangam (PW-8) opined that injured  Narinder   Singh\nwas unfit  to make statement.  Injured Narinder Singh succumbed to  injuries\nat about  5.30 a.m. on 23.8.1998  and death intimation  was  sent   to   the\nPolice Post, PGI Chandigarh.  On the same day Chanda  Singh  came  back   to\nLadwa and went to the police station and lodged the complaint on  the  basis\nof which FIR was registered at  Ladwa  Police Station, ASI Charan Dass  (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">11) went to PGI Chandigarh and conducted  the inquest  on the dead  body  of\ndeceased  Narinder  Singh.  In  PGI,  Dr.  Surinder           Singh  (PW-10)\nconducted autopsy on the body of  Narinder  Singh   and   noted  18  incised\ninjuries and other injuries all over the body of  the  deceased  and  issued\nthe Post Mortem Certificate.  Dr. Surinder Singh  (PW-10)  opined  that  the\ndeceased died of cut injuries on the  head  and  due  to  haemorrhage   from\nmultiple  incised wounds.  The  accused  surrendered  before  the  court  on\nvarious dates and on information of their surrender, Inspector  Jagdish  Ram\n(PW-12) took the accused to police custody and  based  on  their  confession\nthe  weapons  and  motor  cycles  were   seized.     After   completion   of\ninvestigation, the accused were charge sheeted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_4\">Section  302</a>  IPC  read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 149</a> IPC.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">4.          To  bring  home  the  guilt  of  the  accused,  prosecution  has\nexamined PWs 1 to 16 and placed reliance on documents and material  objects.\nThe  accused  were  questioned  under  <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_6\">Section   313</a>   Cr.P.C.   about   the\nincriminating evidence and  circumstances  and  they  denied  all  of  them.\nAccused Ranbir Singh took a plea of alibi by stating that he  is  practising\nas an advocate at Kurukshetra  and was not present    at  the  spot  on  the\ndate of occurrence.  Gurdev Singh (A-2) also took  the  plea  of  alibi  and\nstated that he was posted as a Naib Tehsildar and  in  connection  with  his\nofficial work had gone to village Sardhaheri  on  the  date  of  occurrence.\nThe accused examined DWs 1to 6 as witness on their side.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">5.           Upon   consideration  of  the  evidence,   the    trial   court\nconvicted and sentenced Dilawar Singh (A-1), Yash Pal  (A-3),  Balkar  Singh\n(A-4), Ranbir Singh (A-6), Shamsher  Singh  (A-7)  and  Charan  Singh  (A-8)\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 302</a>  IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_8\">Section  149</a>  IPC  and  sentenced  them  to\nundergo life imprisonment and to pay a fine of Rs.5,000/- each with  default\nclause and also convicted them for the  offence   punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_9\">Section\n148</a> IPC and sentenced to undergo rigorous imprisonment for  two  years.  The\ntrial court acquitted Gurdev Singh  (A-2),  Ashok  Kumar  (A-5)  and  Dalbir\nSingh(A-9).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">6.           Being aggrieved  by  the  conviction  and  sentence,  convicted\naccused 1,3,4 and 6 to 8 preferred appeal before the High Court.   The  High\nCourt confirmed  the conviction of  Dilawar Singh (A-1), Yash Pal (A-3)  and\nShamsher Singh (A-7)  and acquitted   Balkar Singh (A-4), Ranbir  Singh  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">6) and  Charan Singh (A-8).  Being  aggrieved  by  the  conviction,  Dilawar\nSingh (A-1), Yash Pal (A-3) and Shamsher Singh  (A-7)  have  filed  Criminal\nAppeal No. 1362/2010.  Being aggrieved by the acquittal of Balkar Singh  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">4), Ranbir Singh (A-6) and Charan Singh (A-8), State has preferred  Criminal\nAppeal                  No.826/2010 and Chanda Singh  (PW-6)–father  of  the\ndeceased Narinder Singh has filed  Criminal Appeal No. 830/2010.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">7.          Mr. Giri, learned Senior Counsel  appearing  for  the  convicted\naccused Dilawar Singh  (A-1),  Yash  Pal  (A-3)  and  Shamsher  Singh  (A-7)\nsubmitted that serious doubts arise as to the presence of Chanda Singh  (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">6) in the scene of occurrence  and trial court as well as High Court   ought\nnot to have based the conviction on the evidence of PW-6 and  conviction  of\nthe aforesaid  accused is not sustainable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">8.          Mr. Rao Ranjit, learned counsel, appearing  for  the  State  has\ntaken us through the evidence of Chanda Singh (PW-6) and Sham  Singh  (PW-7)\nand other evidence and submitted that evidence of  PW-6 is corroborated   by\nevidence of PW-7, recovery of weapons and  Serology Report and  courts  have\nrecorded concurrent findings of fact that PW-6 is  a  reliable  witness  and\nthe  same  does not  warrant interference.   The  learned  counsel   further\nsubmitted that when the   learned courts have  believed the evidence of  PWs\n6 and 7  qua  Dilawar Singh(A-1), Yash Pal(A-3)   and  Shamsher  Singh(A-7),\nthe courts ought not to have disbelieved the case of prosecution qua  Balkar\nSingh (A-4),  Ranbir Singh (A-6) and  Charan Singh (A-8)  for  reversal   of\nacquittal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">9.          We have heard the learned counsel appearing for the  accused  4,\n6 and 8 who were acquitted and also            Mr. Shishpal  Laler,  learned\ncounsel appearing for the appellant- Chanda Singh.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">10.         The prosecution case  revolves  around  the  ocular  version  of\nChanda Singh (PW-6) father of deceased  Narinder  Singh  who  witnessed  the\noccurrence along with his brother Hakam Singh and Sham Singh (PW-7).  PWs  6\nand 7 have spoken about the attack on the deceased and overt act of  accused\nDilawar Singh (A-1), Yash Pal (A-3) and Shamsher  Singh  (A-7)  and  others.\nHakam Singh was not examined.  Evidence of Sham  Singh  (PW-7)  corroborates\nthe version of Chanda Singh (PW-6). Learned courts below found the  evidence\nof PW-6 trustworthy and recorded respective findings for convicting  Dilawar\nSingh (A-1), Yash Pal (A-3) and Shamsher Singh (A-7)  and  acquitting  other\naccused.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">11.         Contending that Chanda  Singh (PW-6) could  not  have  witnessed\nthe occurrence  and the learned  courts erred  in  placing   reliance   upon\nversion of PW-6,  evidence  of  PW-6  is   interalia   assailed  on  various\ngrounds :- (i)  PW-6 had no reason  to  be   present  in  Babain  Road  near\nVeterinary Hospital, Ladwa; (ii) Conduct of PW-6 is  not  natural   that  on\nwitnessing  the attack on  his  son,  he  had  not  naturally   reacted   in\ntrying to save his son but he is alleged to have chased the  accused;  (iii)\nPW-6 had he been the witness, he would  have given  statement to the  police\nimmediately after  the  occurrence   and  there  would  not  have  been   an\ninordinate delay in registration of FIR i.e. on 23.8.1998 at 11.00  A.M  and\nthe delay in registration of  FIR falsifies his evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">12.         Insofar as the contention of the appellants  that  Chanda  Singh\n(PW-6) had no reason to be present in  the  place  of  occurrence,  deceased\nNarinder Singh was dealing in fertilizers at Ladwa and  was  residing  in  a\nhouse near the veterinary hospital of the town.  PW-6 has stated that  their\nhome  place Mehra is at a distance of 5 kms from Ladwa and is  connected  by\na pakka  road which leads  towards  Babain  from  Ladwa.  Village  Mehra  is\nconnected with this            Ladwa - Babain   road  by  a  link  road  and\nwhen this link road is  connecting  PW-6’s  home  village  Mehra,  there  is\nnothing  unusual about Chanda Singh  going  through   Babain  Road  and  his\npresence in the  place of occurrence.  It is unreasonable to  contend   that\nChanda Singh (PW-6) had  no compelling reason  to be present  in  the  place\nof occurrence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">13.         Learned counsel for the appellant contended that the conduct  of\n Chanda Singh (PW-6)  is unnatural and  being  father of  the  deceased  and\non seeing his son belaboured,    PW-6 had not swiftly   acted  to  save  his\nson  and neither PW-6 nor Hakam Singh  or   Sham  Singh  (  PW-7)  took  the\ndeceased to the hospital and Chanda Singh and other  witnesses  are  alleged\nto have left the injured at the place of incident and   proceeded  to  chase\nthe assailants and such unnatural  conduct of PW-6 only shows  that  he  was\nnot present at the place of occurrence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">14.         We find no merit in the submission that Chanda Singh  (PW-6)  is\nto be disbelieved on the ground that  he  has  not  acted  in  a  particular\nmanner to save his son.  Every person who witnesses a murder reacts  in  his\nown  way.  On seeing Narinder Singh being attacked,  PW-6  and  Hakam  Singh\nmight have been shocked and stunned.  Being two  together,  PW-6  and  Hakam\nSingh might have perhaps thought of catching the assailants  and  appear  to\nhave chased them by following them in the car.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">15.         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1182454\" id=\"span_1\">In <a href=\"/doc/1182454/\" id=\"a_10\">Rana Partap and Ors. vs. State of Haryana</a> (1983) 3  SCC  327,\nwhile dealing with the behaviour of the witnesses, this Court opined thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">“6….Every person  who witnesses a murder reacts in his own  way.   Some  are\nstunned, become speechless and stand  rooted   to  the  spot.   Some  become\nhysteric and start wailing.  Some start shouting for help.  Others run  away\nto keep themselves  as far removed from the spot  as possible.   Yet  others\nrush to the rescue of the victim, even going  to  the   extent  of  counter-\nattacking the assailants.  Every one reacts in his own special  way.   There\nis no set rule of natural reaction.  To discard the evidence  of  a  witness\non the ground that  he  did  not  react  in  any  particular  manner  is  to\nappreciate evidence in a wholly unrealistic and unimaginative way.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">   16.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"146499\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/146499/\" id=\"a_11\">State of H.P. v. Mast Ram</a> (2004) 8 SCC 660 it  has  been\nstated that there is no set rule that  one must react  in a particular  way,\nfor the natural reaction of man is  unpredictable.  Everyone reacts in   his\nown way and, hence, natural  human  behaviour  is  difficult   to  prove  by\ncredible  evidence.  It has to be appreciated in the context of given  facts\nand circumstances of the case.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"178297664\" id=\"span_3\">Similar view has  been  reiterated  in  <a href=\"/doc/178297664/\" id=\"a_12\">Lahu\nKamlakar  Patil  and  Anr.  v.  State  of  Maharashtra</a>  (2013)  6  SCC  417.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">17.         Behaviour of the witnesses or their reactions would differ  from\nsituation  to  situation  and  individual  to  individual.  Expectation   of\nuniformity in the reaction of witnesses would be  unrealistic  and  no  hard\nand fast rule can  be   laid  down  as  to  the  uniformity  of   the  human\nreaction.  The evidence of PW-6 is not to be disbelieved simply  because  he\ndid not react in a particular manner.  PW-6 explained how he happened to  be\nthere in  the  place  of  occurrence  and  had  cogently  spoken  about  the\noccurrence and his  evidence  remained  unscathed  despite  searching  cross\nexamination.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">18.         In his evidence  Chanda  Singh  (PW-6)  stated  that  they  have\nchased the assailants for about 300 – 400  meters  and  then  abandoned  the\nchase and returned to the place of occurrence after  fifteen   minutes.   In\nthe meanwhile, injured Narinder Singh  was  shifted   to   Community  Health\nCentre, Ladwa by ASI Charan Dass (PW-11).  Sham  Singh  (PW-7)  stated  that\nafter  chasing the assailants they have returned to the place of  occurrence\nwithin 5-7 minutes.  On behalf of the  appellants,  it  was  contended  that\nchasing the accused to a distance of 200–300 meters would  have  taken  only\nabout 5-7 minutes  and the fact that  Narinder  Singh  was  shifted  to  the\nhospital by the time PW-6 returned  to the place of occurrence   only  shows\nthat PW-6 was not present at the time of occurrence and  that  he  has  been\nplanted as an  eye-witness subsequently.  Version of  PW-6  that  they  have\nchased the assailants and came back after  about  15-20  minutes,  does  not\naffect  his credibility  nor the prosecution case. It is brought  on  record\nthat on the date of occurrence i.e. 22.8.1998 there was  solar  eclipse  and\nSolar Eclipse Fair  was going  on   in  Kurukshetra   and  large  number  of\npeople congregated and the place  of  occurrence   and   nearby   place  was\ncrowded  with  temporary bazaars and exhibitions and therefore   PW-6  could\ncome back  to the place of occurrence  only after  15  minutes  and  in  the\nmeanwhile injured Narinder  Singh  was  shifted       to   Community  Health\nCentre, Ladwa by ASI Charan         Dass (PW-11).  The  alleged  time  taken\nin chasing the accused  and the fact that in the meanwhile   Narinder  Singh\nwas shifted  to  the Community Health Centre, Ladwa, in our view,  does  not\n militate  against the credibility  of PW-6.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">19.         Learned counsel  for the appellants then contended  that  police\nstation in Ladwa is situated within a  short  distance  from  the  place  of\noccurrence and yet no information was given to the  police  immediately.  It\nwas submitted that Chanda Singh (PW-6) had  not given statement   to  police\neither at Ladwa or at Kurukshetra or atleast to PW-4, ASI   Karam  Chand  of\nPolice Post  at PGI Chandigarh  who came to  the  hospital   on  receipt  of\ninformation  of admission  of  injured Narinder Singh in PGI Chandigarh  and\nFIR was registered only on 23.8.1998  at  11.00  A.M.  and   the  inordinate\ndelay in giving information to the  police and registration  of  FIR  raises\nserious  doubts  about   the   credibility    of    prosecution   case   and\ntrustworthiness of PW-6.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">20.         We find no merit  in the submission that  delay in  registration\nof   FIR  is  fatal  to the prosecution case  for the reason that  delay  is\nsatisfactorily explained by the prosecution.  Let  us  briefly  recapitulate\nthe sequence of events.  After chasing the assailants for few minutes,  PW-6\ncame to Community Health Centre, Ladwa  at 9.00  –  9.15  P.M.  Hakam  Singh\nwent to village Mehra to inform   the  family   members  and  for  arranging\nmoney.  By the time  PW-6  arrived  in  the  Ladwa  Hospital,  the  hospital\nauthorities were making  arrangement to refer  the  injured  to  Kurukshetra\nas his condition was  very  serious.    By  the  time  PW-6  went  to  Ladwa\nHospital, PW-11 left to village  Mehra  to  inform  the  family  members  of\ninjured Narinder Singh.  Evidently in Ladwa Hospital, PW-6  could  not  have\nmet ASI Charan Dass  (PW  11).  PW-6  shifted  the  injured  to  Kurukshetra\nHospital at        10.30-11.00 P.M. and then  shifted  Narinder  Singh  from\nKurukshetra Hospital to PGI Chandigarh. They left Kurukshetra between 11.30-\n12.00  P.M.  for  PGI  and  reached  PGI   Chandigarh   at   2.30  A.M.   on\n23.8.1998.  ASI Charan Dass (PW 11) reached Kurukshetra Hospital   at  about\n11.30 P.M. and moved an application to the doctor regarding fitness  of  the\ninjured  to make  a statement.  Again in Kurukshetra there  was  hardly  any\ntime for PW-6 to meet  PW-11,  ASI  Charan   Dass.    There  is  nothing  on\nrecord  showing that PW-6 met PW-11  either  at  Ladwa  or  at  Kurukshetra.\nWhen PW-6 was busy in arranging  medical aid  to  save  his  son,  delay  in\nlodging  the  FIR cannot be said to  be  fatal.   The   sequence  of  events\nclearly show that PW-6 was taking all steps to save the  life  of   his  son\nand making  arrangements for  money, ambulance etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">21.         Whether the delay  is so long as to draw a cloud   of  suspicion\non the prosecution case will depend upon variety of factors which will  vary\nfrom case to case.    As pointed out by the learned courts,  from  the  very\nbeginning the condition of  injured Narinder Singh  was   very  serious  and\nhe was struggling for existence  and his father PW-6 and uncle  Hakam  Singh\nwere concerned about the welfare  of the injured.  While so, they could  not\nhave thought of approaching  the  police first  and  informing   them  about\nthe incident and the assailants.   Where  delay  in  lodging  complaint  and\nregistration of FIR has been satisfactorily explained, the delay  by  itself\nwas no ground for disbelieving the prosecution  evidence  particularly  when\nit had  been accepted both by the Sessions Court and the High Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">22.         Coming to the  further  contention  of  the  appellants  raising\ndoubts about   the credibility of PW-6  in  not  making  any  statement   at\nleast to ASI  Karam Chand (PW-4) of Police Post PGI Chandigarh,  on  receipt\nof  the information regarding  admission  of  injured  Narinder  Singh,  ASI\nKaram Chand (PW-4)  went to the PGI Hospital  to record  the  statement   of\ninjured  Narinder Singh. At that time, Chanda  Singh  (PW-6)  was  attending\nhis son.  The contention of the appellants is that   PW-6 had  the  occasion\nto  inform the police  about the incident   at least to ASI Karam Chand (PW-\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">4) but the same was not done which raise serious doubts about  the  presence\nof Chanda Singh (PW-6) at  the  scene  of  occurrence.  By  perusal  of  the\nevidence of PW-4, it is seen that on receipt  of  intimation  (rukka)   from\nPGI Chandigarh, PW-4 rushed to the  hospital  for  recording  the  statement\nof  injured Narinder Singh.  Since Chanda Singh (PW-6)  did  not  offer  any\nstatement  to ASI Karam Chand  (PW-4), since Narinder Singh was then  alive,\nthere was no occasion for recording  the statement  of Chanda Singh.  It  is\nalso brought in evidence that after the death of  Narinder Singh  ASI  Karam\nChand (PW-4) did not  go to  PGI for the second time.  In our  view,   there\nis no merit in the submission  that PW-6 is to be disbelieved on the  ground\nthat he did not  choose to give  any statement at least to ASI  Karam  Chand\n(PW-4).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">23.         Narinder Singh died at 5.30 A.M.  on  23.8.1998  and  thereafter\nChanda Singh (PW-6) went to Ladwa Police Station on 23.8.1998 at 11.00  A.M.\nand lodged the complaint and FIR was registered  as Ext PE No. 314/1998   at\nLadwa Police Station.  Sequence of  events  clearly  show   that  PW-6   was\nattending  his son and was taking  steps to shift   injured  Narinder  Singh\nfrom  Community Health Centre Ladwa  to  Lok  Nayak  Jai  Parkash  Hospital,\nKurukshetra and from Kurukshetra to PGI Chandigarh  and  PW-6  was  busy  in\narranging  for money, medical aid and ambulance etc.  The  delay  of   about\n15 hours  and 15 minutes  in lodging  the FIR,   in  our  view,   cannot  be\nsaid to be fatal.  Learned courts have  recorded   concurrent  finding  that\nthe  delay in registration  of FIR  has been  satisfactorily  explained  and\nthe delay is not fatal to the prosecution case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">24.         While appreciating the  evidence  of  a  witness,  the  approach\nmust be whether the evidence  of the witness  read as  a  whole  appears  to\nhave a ring  of truth. Once that impression is formed it  is  necessary  for\nthe court  to scrutinize  the evidence,  to find out whether it  is  against\nthe  general tenor of the prosecution  case.   Learned  courts  below  found\nevidence of PW-6 reliable and accepted the same.  The power  of  this  Court\nunder <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 136</a> of the  Constitution  are  very  wide.   But  in  criminal\nappeals this Court does not interfere with the concurrent findings  of  fact\nsave in exceptional circumstances. When the learned courts below  found  the\nevidence of PW-6 reliable and acceptable, we do not find any  perversity  in\nthe approach of the  learned  courts  in  accepting  the  evidence  of  PW-6\nwarranting interference in exercise of  jurisdiction under  <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_14\">Article  136</a>  of\nthe Constitution of India.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">25.         Evidence of Chanda Singh (PW-6) is corroborated by the  evidence\nof Sham Singh (PW-7).  Credibility of PW-7 is assailed on  the  ground  that\nhe was also challaned along with Narinder Singh in  criminal  case  in  1994\nand that PW-7 has animosity against the accused  persons.   The  mere   fact\nthat PW-7 was also challaned along with  Narinder  Singh  and  that  he  was\ninimical towards the accused would not result  in  mechanical  rejection  of\nevidence of  such a witness; but would only make the  court  cautious  while\nevaluating   the   testimony  of  the  witness  and  we  do  not  find   any\ninfirmity in the  appreciation of  evidence  of  PW-7   by  the  courts  and\nrelying  upon the same as corroborative evidence.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">26.         PWs 6 and 7 have spoken in one voice against Dilawar  Singh  (A-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">1), Yash Pal (A-3)  and  Shamsher  Singh  (A-7).   Their  evidence  is  also\ncorroborated by the medical evidence  of  Dr.  Surinder  Singh  (PW-10)  who\nconducted the autopsy on the body of  Narinder Singh.   As  per  Post-Mortem\nCertificate, 18 incised wounds were found on the body of the deceased  which\nstrengthen the prosecution case as to the overt act of the accused 1, 3  and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">7.  Based on the confessional statement of the disclosure of  Dilawar  Singh\n(A-1), Yash Pal (A-3) and Shamsher   Singh  (A-7)   cutters  were  recovered\nand detection of human blood in those cutters also  lends  credence  to  the\nprosecution case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">27.         Placing  reliance  on  the  evidence  of  DW-1,              Dr.\nAshwini Kumar feeble attempt was made to contend that serious  doubts  arise\nabout the prosecution case.  Of  course,  according  to  DW-1,  Dr.  Ashwini\nKumar who admitted injured Narinder  Singh   in  Ladwa  Hospital,  he  found\nonly five injuries on the person of  the injured and  he  opined  that   the\nsame had been caused by blunt weapon.  As per Post Mortem  Certificate    as\nmany as 18 incised wounds were found on the  body  of  Narinder  Singh.   As\nheld by the learned courts DW-1 did not examine the injuries on  the  person\nof the injured in  right  perspective  and  did  not  correctly  record  the\ninjuries on the  person  of  Narinder  Singh.   Opinion  of  DW-1  that  the\ninjuries were the result of blunt weapon is false and  for  that  reason  he\nhas been rightly challaned by the police for the  offence  punishable  under\n<a href=\"/doc/986493/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 218</a> IPC on the ground that he had  prepared  the  wound  certificate\nfalsely.  Reasonings contained in paragraphs 44 and 45 in  the  judgment  of\nthe Sessions Court sufficiently answer the arguments advanced on  behalf  of\nthe appellant and the evidence of DW-1 is of no assistance to  the  accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">28.         The trial court and the High Court recorded concurrent  findings\nholding that the appellants accused Dilawar Singh (A-1), Yash Pal (A-3)  and\nShamsher Singh (A-7) have committed the offences  punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_16\">Section\n302</a> IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 149</a> IPC and under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 148</a> IPC.

A-6, Ranbir Singh  has put forth defence  plea  of  alibi.  A-6,\nRanbir Singh was a practising lawyer at Kurukshetra and he was working as  a\njunior advocate in the office of  Senior  Advocate,  Mr.  S.C.  Sharma.  Mr.\nYudhvir Singh, advocate was examined as DW-6, who was also  practising  with\nMr. S.C.Sharma.  He stated that on the date  of  occurrence     A-6,  Ranbir\nSingh was in the  office  of  Senior  Advocate  and  not  at  the  place  of\noccurrence.  Trial Court has not accepted the plea of alibi  raised  by  him\nonly on the ground that the Senior Advocate with whom A-6, Ranbir Singh  was\npractising was not examined.  The High Court  held  that  evidence  of  DW-6\ncannot be doubted as there was no reason  to  disbelieve  him  and  plea  of\nalibi taken by A-6, Ranbir Singh cannot be rejected on the ground  that  his\nSenior Advocate Mr. S.C.

The court of appeal would  not  ordinarily  interfere  with  the\norder of acquittal unless the approach is vitiated by  manifest  illegality.\nIn an appeal against acquittal, this Court will not interfere with an  order\nof acquittal merely because  on the evaluation of the evidence, a  different\nplausible view may arise and   views  taken  by  the  courts  below  is  not\ncorrect.
