As  a  matter  of  fact,   they   did   not  attribute \n\n\n\nany sexual activities to William except alleging that he used to \n\n\n\nbeat   them   on   flimsy   grounds   and   used   to   do   canning.     Both \n\n\n\nPWs 1 and 4 asserted that William never had sex with them or \n\n\n\nother boys.   As rightly observed by the trial Judge, the above \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                                             23</span>\n\n\f\ninformation   by  PWs  1  and 4 shows  that  they   were  staying   in \n\n\n\nthe   shelter   homes   at   the   relevant   time.     After   analyzing   the \n\n\n\nevidence   of   PWs   1   and   4,   we   are   of   the   view   that   more \n\n\n\nconfidence can be reposed on their evidence and the omissions \n\n\n\nas   pointed   out   by   the   High   Court   are   not   fatal   to   the \n\n\n\nprosecution   case.     In   case,   there   may   be   some   omissions \n\n\n\nbecause   the   Public   Prosecutor   has   put   questions   to   these \n\n\n\nwitnesses   which   the   I.O.   has   not,   we   are,   however,   satisfied \n\n\n\nthat there is no variance between the examination-in-chief and \n\n\n\ncross-examination of PWs 1 and 4 with regard to the material \n\n\n\nparticulars   of   sexual   abuse.     No   statement   of   these   boys \n\n\n\nduring   cross-examination   has   been   negated   before   the \n\n\n\nexamination-in-chief.     Considering   the   background   of   PWs   1 \n\n\n\nand   4,   the   delay  in   divulging   the   facts   of   beating   and   also  of \n\n\n\nsexual abuse to any other person does not mean that there is \n\n\n\nno sexual  exploitation  or  abuse or that they   were deterred or \n\n\n\nthat they were deposed falsely as per the design of some other \n\n\n\nperson.  We hold that the trial Judge has correctly appreciated \n\n\n\nthe   evidence   of   PWs   1   and   4   and   arrived   at   a   proper \n\n\n\nconclusion,   on  the  other  hand,  the  High  Court  committed   an \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                                 24</span>\n\n\f\nerror  in holding that their  statements are suspicious and not \n\n\n\nreliable and not proved beyond shadow of doubt.

In   that   case,   the \n\n\nrespondent   was   found   guilty   of   offences   punishable   under \n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/513777/\" id=\"a_37\">Section   451</a>   and   <a href=\"/doc/1836974/\" id=\"a_38\">377</a>   IPC.

The factual background shows that \n\n\n\non   10.11.1986   the   accused   trespassed   into   the   house   of   the \n\n\n\nvictim girl who was nearly about 10 years of age on the date of \n\n\n\noccurrence   and   committed   unnatural   offence   on   her.     After \n\n\n\nfinding the victim alone in the house, the accused committed \n\n\n\nunnatural   offence   by   putting   his   penis   having   carnal \n\n\n\nintercourse   against   order   of   nature.     The   victim   PW-1   told \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                                                  29</span>\n\n\f\nabout the incident to her friend PW-2 who narrated the same \n\n\n\nto the parents of the victim and accordingly on 13.11.1986, an \n\n\n\nFIR   was   lodged.     On   consideration   of   the   entire   prosecution \n\n\n\nversion, the trial Court found the accused guilty and convicted \n\n\n\nand   sentenced   as   aforesaid.     An   appeal   before   the   Sessions \n\n\n\nJudge did not bring any relief to the accused and revision was \n\n\n\nfiled   before   the   High   Court   which   set   aside   the   order   of \n\n\n\nconviction   and   sentence.     The   primary   ground   on   which   the \n\n\n\nHigh Court directed acquittal was the absence of corroboration \n\n\n\nand   alleged   suppression   of   a   report   purported   to   have   been \n\n\n\ngiven before the FIR in question was lodged.  In support of the \n\n\n\nappeal, the State submitted that the High Court&#x27;s approach is \n\n\n\nclearly erroneous and it was pointed out that corroboration is \n\n\n\nnot   necessary   for   a   case   of   this   nature.     The   following \n\n\n\nobservations and conclusion are relevant:</span>  \n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"915673\" id=\"span_31\">&quot;7.  An   accused   cannot   cling   to   a   fossil   formula   and \n   insist on corroborative evidence, even if taken as a whole, \n   the case spoken to by the victim strikes a judicial mind as \n   probable.   Judicial   response   to   human   rights   cannot   be \n   blunted by legal jugglery. A similar view was expressed by \n   this Court in <a href=\"/doc/915673/\" id=\"a_39\">Rafiq v. State  of U.P.</a> with some anguish.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"207774\" id=\"span_32\">The \n   same was echoed again in  <a href=\"/doc/207774/\" id=\"a_40\">Bharwada  Bhoginbhai Hirjibhai \n   v. State  of Gujarat</a>. It was observed in the said case that in \n   the   Indian   setting   refusal   to   act   on   the   testimony   of   the \n   victim of sexual assault in the absence of corroboration as \n   a rule, is adding insult to injury. A girl or a woman in the \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                                                     30</span>\n\n\f\ntradition-bound   non-permissive   society   of   India   would   be \nextremely reluctant even to admit that any incident which \nis   likely   to   reflect   on   her   chastity   or   dignity   had   ever \noccurred.   She   would   be   conscious   of   the   danger   of   being \nostracised   by   the   society   and   when   in   the   face   of   these \nfactors   the   crime   is   brought   to   light,   there   is   inbuilt \nassurance   that   the   charge   is   genuine   rather   than \nfabricated. Just as a witness who has sustained an injury, \nwhich   is   not   shown   or   believed   to   be   self-inflicted,   is   the \nbest witness in the sense that he is least likely to exculpate \nthe real offender, the evidence of a victim of sex offence is \nentitled   to   great   weight,   absence   of   corroboration \nnotwithstanding. Corroboration is not the sine qua non for \nconviction in a rape case.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1420504\" id=\"span_34\">The observations of Vivian Bose, \nJ. in <a href=\"/doc/1420504/\" id=\"a_41\">Rameshwar v.

To insist on corroboration except in the rarest of rare \ncases is to equate one who is a victim of the lust of another \nwith   an   accomplice   to   a   crime   and   thereby   insult \nwomanhood.   It   would   be   adding   insult   to   injury   to   tell   a \nwoman that her claim of rape will not be believed unless it \nis corroborated in material particulars as in &quot;the case of an \naccomplice   to   a   crime&quot;.   (See  <a href=\"/doc/706090/\" id=\"a_42\">State   of   Maharashtra  v. \nChandraprakash   Kewalchand   Jain</a>.)   Why   should   the \nevidence of the girl or the woman who complains of rape or \nsexual   molestation   be   viewed   with   the   aid   of   spectacles \nfitted with lenses tinged with doubt, disbelief or suspicion? \nThe plea about lack of corroboration has no substance.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">   9.  It is unfortunate that respect for womanhood in our \ncountry   is   on   the   decline   and   cases   of   molestation   and \nrape are steadily growing.
