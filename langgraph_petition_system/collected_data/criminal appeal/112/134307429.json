Likewise, it was also an\n\n       admitted position that all the three appellants/landlords were not\n\n       present at the spot. Further, a comprehensive investigation was\n\n       carried out by the police wherein no involvement of the appellants\n\n       was found and, therefore, they were not charge sheeted.

In these\n\n       circumstances, argued the learned senior counsel, that the trial\n\n       court rightly dismissed the application under <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 319</a> of the\n\n       Cr.P.C. which was a belated attempt on the part of the\n\n       complainant to implicate the appellants, inasmuch as that\n\n       application was filed much after the complainant was examined\n\n       as PW-1, and by that time the prosecution had even closed its\n\n       evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">\nCriminal Appeal No. 1720 of 2017 &amp; Ors.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">(arising out of SLP (Crl.)

It is held that it\n                   is that material, after cognizance is taken by the court, that\n                   is available to it while making an inquiry into or trying an\n                   offence, which the court can utilise or take into\n                   consideration for supporting reasons to summon any\n                   person on the basis of evidence adduced before the court.\n                   The word “evidence” has to be understood in its wider\n                   sense, both at the stage of trial and even at the stage of\n                   inquiry. It means that the power to proceed against any\n                   person after summoning him can be exercised on the basis\n                   of any such material as brought forth before it. At the same\n                   time, this Court cautioned that the duty and obligation of\n                   the court becomes more onerous to invoke such powers\n                   consciously on such material after evidence has been led\n                   during trial. The Court also clarified that “ evidence” under\n                   <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 319</a> CrPC could even be examination-in-chief and\n                   the Court is not required to wait till such evidence is tested\n                   on cross-examination, as it is the satisfaction of the court\n                   which can be gathered from the reasons recorded by the\n                   court in respect of complicity of some other person(s) not\n                   facing trial in the offence.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"78958066\" id=\"span_32\">12.     The moot question, however, is the degree of\n                   satisfaction that is required for invoking the powers under\n                   <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 319</a> CrPC and the related question is as to in what\n                   situations this power should be exercised in respect of a\n                   person named in the FIR but not charge-sheeted. These\n                   two aspects were also specifically dealt with by the\n                   Constitution Bench in <a href=\"/doc/78958066/\" id=\"a_37\">Hardeep Singh</a> case and answered\n                   in the following manner: (SCC pp. 135 &amp; 138, paras 95 &amp;\n                   105-106)\n\n                         “95.

The test that has to be applied is one\n                         which is more than prima facie case as\n                         exercised at the time of framing of charge , but\n                         short of satisfaction to an extent that the\n                         evidence, if goes unrebutted, would lead to\n                         conviction.

There was no\n\n           documentary           evidence        produced   by   the   complainant.\n\n           Therefore, the available ‘evidence’ was not sufficient to\n\n           implead the appellants/proposed accused as accused in the\n\n           case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">       (b)     The Police, after thorough investigation, had filed the charg\n\n           sheet in which the appellants were not implicated.

The argument\n\n       advanced is that the application filed by the complainant under\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 319</a> Cr.P.C. was an afterthought and belated effort on the\n\n       part of the complainant, which was filed much after the recording\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 1720 of 2017 &amp; Ors.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">(arising out of SLP (Crl.)

In this context, the High\n\n       Court has observed that ‘evidence’ within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_54\">Section\n\n       319</a> Cr.P.C. would include the aforesaid statements and,\n\n       therefore, the appellants could be summoned.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">   33)         The aforesaid reasons given by the High Court do not stand\n\n       the judicial scrutiny.           The High Court has not dealt with the\n\n       subject matter properly and even in the absence of strong and\n\n       cogent evidence against the appellant, it has set aside the order\n\n       of the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate and exercised its discretion\n\n       in summoning in summoning the appellants as accused persons.\n\n       No doubt, at one place the Constitution Bench observed in\n\n       Hardeep Singh’s case that the word ‘evidence’ has to be\n\n       understood in its wider sense, both at the stage of trial and even\n\n       at the stage of inquiry.              In paragraph 105 of the judgment,\nCriminal Appeal No. 1720 of 2017 &amp; Ors.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">(arising out of SLP (Crl.) No. 5308 of 2017 &amp; Ors.)

This sentence gives an impression\n\n       that only that evidence which has been led before the Court is to\n\n       be seen and not the evidence which was collected at the stage of\n\n       inquiry.      However there is no contradiction between the two\n\n       observations as the Court also clarified that the ‘evidence’, on the\n\n       basis of which an accused is to be summoned to face the trial in\n\n       an ongoing case, has to be the material that is brought before the\n\n       Court during trial.             The material/evidence collected by the\n\n       investigating officer at the stage of inquiry can only be utilised for\n\n       corroboration and to support the evidence recorded by the Court\n\n       to invoke the power under Section 319 Cr.P.C.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">   34)         It needs to be highlighted that when a person is named in\n\n       the FIR by the complainant, but Police, after investigation, finds\n\n       no role of that particular person and files the charge sheet without\n\n       implicating him, the Court is not powerless, and at the stage of\n\n       summoning, if the trial court finds that a particular person should\n\n       be summoned as accused, even though not named in the charge\n\n       sheet, it can do so.              At that stage, chance is given to the\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 1720 of 2017 &amp; Ors.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">(arising out of SLP (Crl.)

Once that stage has\n\n       gone, the Court is still not powerless by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 319</a> of\n\n       the Cr.P.C. However, this section gets triggered when during the\n\n       trial some evidence surfaces against the proposed accused.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_85\">   35)         In view of the above, it was not open to the High Court to\n\n       rely upon the statements recorded under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 161</a> Cr.P.C. as\n\n       independent evidence. It could only be corroborative material. In\n\n       the first instance, ‘evidence’ led before the Court had to be taken\n\n       into consideration. As far as deposition of PW-1 which was given\n\n       in the Court is concerned, on going through the said statement, it\n\n       becomes clear that he has not alleged any conspiracy on the part\n\n       of the appellants/landlords. In fact, none of the witness has said\n\n       so. In the absence thereof, along with the important fact that\n\n       these appellants/landlords were admittedly not present at the site\n\n       when the alleged incident took place, we do not find any\n\n       ‘evidence’ within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 319</a> Cr.P.C. on the basis\n\n       of which they could be summoned as accused persons. PW-1\n\n       and PW-4 have deposed about the incident that took place at the\n\n       site and the manner in which the persons who are present\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 1720 of 2017 &amp; Ors.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">(arising out of SLP (Crl.)

In the statement of PW-4, he has alleged that\n\n       “Subsequently I came to know the said people is not police\n\n       officials the people was sent by landlords of the building...”. That\n\n       statement may not be enough for roping in the appellants/\n\n       landlords to face the charge under those provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_58\">IPC</a> with\n\n       which others are charged. The standard of evidence mentioned\n\n       in Hardeep Singh’s case, namely, ‘strong and cogent evidence’,\n\n       is lacking.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">   36)         Insofar as the appellant/bailiff is concerned, there is no\n\n       specific attribution in the FIR or in the depositions of PWs 1 to 6\n\n       in the Court. As far as the departmental inquiry, which was held\n\n       against the bailiff is concerned, as already noted above, he has\n\n       been found guilty of dereliction of duty only and not of other\n\n       charge.       Pertinently, in the said inquiry, thought the de facto\n\n       complainant appeared and he also produced another witness,\n\n       there was no utterance against the appellant/bailiff on these\n\n       allegations, because of which even the Inquiry Officer has held\n\n       that such a charge has not been proved. No doubt, that is not a\n\n       determinative factor as the criminal proceedings are judicial\n\n       proceedings, totally independent in nature. However, what is\n\n       relevant is that the Police, during investigation, after the\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 1720 of 2017 &amp; Ors.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">(arising out of SLP (Crl.)

Further, as pointed out\n\n       above, during trial, no ‘strong and cogent evidence’ has surfaced\n\n       against the appellant/bailiff on the basis of which he could be\n\n       summoned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\">   37)         Having regard to the aforesaid discussion, judgment cited\n\n       by the learned counsel for the complainant would be of no help to\n\n       him.      Decision in India Carat Pvt. Ltd.’s case was cited to\n\n       contend that the trial court failed to issue any notice to the\n\n       complainant at the time of summoning the persons implicated in\n\n       the charge sheet. However, insofar as issue of initial summoning\n\n       of the trial court is concerned, whereby the appellants were not\n\n       summoned, this order was not challenged by the complainant at\n\n       the stage. At this stage, we are concerned only with the exercise\n\n       of jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/435819/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 319</a> Cr.P.C. Insofar as judgment in\n\n       Geeta Ram’s case is concerned, there is no quarrel about the\n\n       proposition that provisions of Section 319 can be invoked even\n\n       where the name of the person is in the FIR yet no charge sheet is\n\n       filed against him. It is again emphasized that the question is as to\n\n       whether there is a proper exercise of power under Section 319\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 1720 of 2017 &amp; Ors.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">(arising out of SLP (Crl.)
