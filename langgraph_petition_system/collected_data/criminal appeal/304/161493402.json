The   factory   was   on   the   ground   floor \n\n          whereas the couple were residing on the first floor of the \n\n          premises.  On the 10th of June, 2000, the couple attended a \n\n          tea   party   in   the   house   of   their   acquaintance   one   Parth \n\n          Deshpande, and after the party was over at about 6:00p.m. \n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">          P.W.   6   Mohan   Ramnath,   who   had   also   attended   the   party, \n\n          dropped   them   off   at   their   residence   in   his   car.     As   per \n\n          the prosecution story, at about 8:30p.m., P.W. 1 Parasram \n\n          and   his   wife   heard   some   knocking   on   their   door   and   on \n\n          opening   the   same   they   saw   Shilpa   aforesaid   lying   on   the \n\n          ground.   On enquiry she disclosed that three persons had \n\n          attacked her husband and her and had caused   them severe \n\n          injuries.   On receiving this information,   P.W. 1 and his \n\n          wife   immediately   summoned   P.W.   16   Dr.   Ramesh   who   had   a \n\n          hospital close by and on his advice they first took Shilpa \n\n          to his hospital and she and her husband were later shifted \n\n          to the K.L.E. Hospital.  The doctor pronounced Sudhakar as \n\n          having   been   brought   dead   on   arrival   whereas   Shilpa   died \n\n          three   days   later   while   under   treatment.   P.W.   1,   who   was \n\n          the   business   Manager   of   the   couple,   also   informed   the \n\n          relatives of the victims including P.W. 9 the son of the \n\n          deceased   and   P.W.   17   Sudhakar&#x27;s   brother   also   reached   the \n\n          spot.

During \n\n          the   course   of   the   investigation,   some   finger   prints   were \n\n          lifted from a window pane as per the scientific procedure \n\n          prescribed.     A   search   was   also   conducted   in   the \n\n          neighbourhood  and the accused were ultimately arrested on \n\n          the 22nd June, 2000 by a police party as they were behaving \n\n          in a  suspicious manner.  They were brought to the police \n\n          station   and   interrogated   by   P.W.   28   to   whom   they   made \n\n          disclosure   statements   under   <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_3\">Section   27</a>   of   the   Evidence \n\n          Act.  Pursuant to the disclosure statements, recoveries of \n\n          gold   ornaments   alleged   to   have   been   taken   from   the \n\n          deceased couple as also the blood stained clothes of the \n\n          accused were recovered in the presence of P.W. 24.  On the \n\n          completion of the investigation, the accused were charged \n\n          for   offences   punishable   under   Section   302   read   with \n\n          <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 34</a> of the IPC on two counts and under <a href=\"/doc/329571/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 392</a> \n\n          and   <a href=\"/doc/1865117/\" id=\"a_6\">397</a>   of   the   IPC.     They   denied   their   culpability   and \n\n          were accordingly brought to trial.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">          2.2              The   prosecution   produced   29   witnesses   in   evidence \n\n          and   also   a   large   number   of   exhibits   including   the \n\n          recovered   articles   on   disclosure   as   also   those   that   had \n\n          been   picked   up   from   the   spot.     The   trial   court   on   an \n\n          appreciation   of   the   evidence   held   the   accused   guilty   on \n\n          all   counts   and   convicted   and   sentenced   them   to   undergo \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">Crl.A.

The   trial   court   noticed \n\n          that   all   the   witnesses   including   P.Ws.   3   and   5   who   were \n\n          the   neighbours   of   the   deceased   and   who   were   alleged   to \n\n          have   seen   the   accused   running   away   after   the   crime,   had \n\n          been   declared   hostile   as   they   had   not   supported   the \n\n          prosecution.  Likewise,  P.W. 7, the jeweller who had been \n\n          brought   by   the   investigating   agency   to   verify   and   weigh \n\n          the ornaments, did not support the prosecution and he too \n\n          had been declared hostile.  Even more significantly P.W. 8 \n\n          to   whom   the   stolen   ornaments   had   been   allegedly   sold \n\n          backed   away   from   supporting   the   prosecution.     The   matter \n\n          was thereafter taken in appeal to the High Court and the \n\n          High   Court   while   noticing   that   the   only   evidence   against \n\n          the appellants were the recoveries made from them pursuant \n\n          to their statements under <a href=\"/doc/1312051/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 27</a> of the Evidence Act \n\n          (as all the other material witnesses referred to above had \n\n          not supported the prosecution)   dismissed the appeal.   It \n\n          is   in   this   situation   that   the   matter   is   before   us   after \n\n          the grant of special leave.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">          3.               We   have   heard   the   learned   counsel   for   the   parties \n\n          and   have   gone   through   the   record   carefully   with   their \n\n          assistance.  Several judgments have also been cited by the \n\n          learned   counsel   on   which   we   do   not   intend   to   dilate   as \n\n          they are basically on the facts and circumstances of each \n\n          case.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">Crl.A.

As already noticed the primary evidence against the \n\n          accused is the recovery of the gold ornaments from them. \n\n          These are a mangalsutra, a ring and a chain.  In addition, \n\n          a   finger   print   of   A3   Amit   Rama   Naik   the   appellant   in \n\n          Criminal Appeal No. 739 of 2006 had also been lifted from \n\n          a window pane.  The learned counsel representing Amit Rama \n\n          Naik   has,   accordingly,   argued   that   the   specimen   finger \n\n          prints had not been taken from him in accordance with the \n\n          procedure prescribed under the <a href=\"/doc/1747275/\" id=\"a_8\">Identification of Prisoners \n\n          Act, 1920</a> as it was incumbent on the investigating officer \n\n          to have filed an application before the Magistrate before \n\n          he   could   have   taken   the   finger   prints   from   him.     We, \n\n          accordingly, put it to the learned counsel if the fact as \n\n          to whether such an order of the Magistrate had been taken \n\n          or   not   had   been   raised   in   the   cross   examination   of   the \n\n          investigating officer, P.W. 28.  We have also gone through \n\n          the evidence of P.W. 28 and have found that not a single \n\n          question had been put to him doubting the   correctness of \n\n          the procedure prescribed.     We must, therefore, hold that \n\n          the finger print taken from the site had been identified \n\n          as that of Amit Rama Naik.   We must also record that the \n\n          ornaments   recovered   were   of   common   use   and   available   to \n\n          all   and   sundry   and   they   were   produced   for   identification \n\n          in court only during the recording of the evidence and no \n\n          attempt   had   been   made   by   the   police   to   have   them \n\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Crl.A. No. 1487 of 2005</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                   6</span>\n\n\n\n\n\n          identified   at   any   earlier   point   of   time.     It   is   also \n\n          significant   that   A2   was   alleged   to   have   been   an   ex-\n\n          employee   of   the   deceased   couple.     If   that   had   been   so, \n\n          Shilpa would ordinarily have been able to identify him as \n\n          he   had   left   employment   only   four   years   earlier. \n\n          Admittedly, she did not name any person in her statement \n\n          immediately   after   the   incident.     In   this   view   of   the \n\n          matter, we find that the identification and involvement of \n\n          A1 and A2 i.e. Rama appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 1135 \n\n          of   2006   and   Bharama   Parasram   Kudachkar   appellant   in \n\n          Criminal   Appeal   No.   1487   of   2005,   is   doubtful.     We, \n\n          accordingly,   allow   their   appeals   and   order   their \n\n          acquittal.     The   bail   bonds   of   A2   i.e.   Bharama   Parasram \n\n          Kudachkar shall stand discharged.   A1 i.e. Rama is stated \n\n          to be in jail.   He shall be set forth immediately if not \n\n          required in any other case.
