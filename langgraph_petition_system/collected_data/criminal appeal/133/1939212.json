Goel,\ncomplainant  and father of the deceased also filed  Criminal\nRevision No.199 of 1997 praying for enhancement of sentence.\nThe  High Court re- appreciated the evidence and  considered\nthe  circumstances  connecting the accused with\t the  crime.\nThe High Court disbelieved the evidence of PW6 Gulshan Kumar\nthat  he saw the deceased and accused quarrelling near Kesar\nHotel  and  that  he  separated\t them  as  in  his  previous\nstatement  he  had not stated that he enquired the names  of\nthose  boys from them.\tThe High Court held that even if the\nsaid  evidence\tis ruled out of consideration, it will\tmake\nonly motive in the case behind the killing of Vishal absent.\nHowever,  the  Court relied upon the evidence of  PW9  Laxmi\nNarain\ton the ground that Sandeep was known to him  earlier\nand that Vikram, Aman and Sandeep went to the house of Laxmi\nNarain\tin  expectation that he was having association\twith\nthe  complainant V.K.  Goel so he would be able to help them\nin the investigation or in the trial.  The Court relied upon\nthe  evidence  of  PW11 Manish Sharma for  arriving  at\t the\nconclusion  that the accused and the deceased were last seen\ntogether.   Manish  also  gave motor-cycle number  as  HR-29\nE/3698.\t  The  Court  also relied upon the evidence  of\t PW7\nBankey\tLal who after some time saw motor-cycle and  scooter\ncoming\tat fast speed.\tOn the motor-cycle, he saw  Sandeep,\nAman and Arun.\tArun was driving the motor-cycle and Sandeep\nwas  having sword in his hand.\tHe also saw Mandeep  driving\nthe scooter and Vikram sitting on its pillion.\tOn the basis\nof  the\t information,  V.K.  Goel alongwith  Manish  Sharma,\nBhuneshwar  and Bankey Lal went in search of Vishal and when\nthey reached near Gurgaon canal they found a pair of chappal\nof brown colour belonging to deceased.\tOne locket belonging\nto the deceased was also found lying there.  At the instance\nof  accused  Sandeep,  bloodstained sword and  clothes\twere\nrecovered.   Similarly,\t at the instance of accused  Vikram,\nmotor-cycle  was  recovered  and also  bloodstained  clothes\ncontaining  human blood as reported by the Chemical  Analyst\nwere  found.   Considering the aforesaid circumstances,\t the\nCourt  arrived\tat the conclusion that the  prosecution\t has\nsuccessfully  brought  home  beyond pale  of  doubt  against\nVikram\tand  Sandeep the charge of murder of Vishal Goel  on\n15th  March, 1995 in furtherance of their common  intention.\nHowever,  the Court arrived at the conclusion that there was\nno  evidence  of  recovery so far as Mandeep and  Arun\twere\nconcerned  and only evidence that they were last seen in the\ncompany of deceased would not alone be sufficient to convict\nthem.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">    The\t High Court by the impugned judgment and order dated\n28th  April, 1999 dismissed the Criminal Appeal Nos.  48 and\n49-DB  of  1997 filed by Sandeep (A-1) and Vikram (A-3)\t and\nconfirmed  their  conviction.

The  State\nof  Haryana has also filed Criminal Appeal No.\t349 of\t2000\nagainst acquittal of Mandeep.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">    It\tis the prosecution version that on 15th March,\t1995\nat  about  7.30\t p.m., i.e.  on the day\t of  incident,\twhen\ndeceased  Vishal  was  at his house and was  about  to\ttake\nmeals, some one called him from outside on which he went out\nand did not come back.\tIn the night, father of the deceased\nlodged\t a  missing  report,  Ex.PP.\tOn  the\t next\tday,\ncomplainant  was informed by PW11 Manish Sharma that he\t had\nseen  the deceased going on a motor-cycle along with Sandeep\n(A-1)  and  Arun  Bhatia  (A-2)\t in  the  evening  time\t  on\n15.3.1995.   He\t was also informed by Bankey Lal  (PW7)\t and\nBhuneshwar  that  on 15.3.1995 they saw one motor-cycle\t and\none  scooter  coming  from  the\t  side\tof  canal.   On\t the\nmotor-cycle,  they  saw\t Sandeep, Aman and Arun.   Arun\t was\ndriving\t the  motor-cycle and Sandeep was having a sword  in\nhis  hand.  The scooter was driven by Mandeep and Vikram was\npillion rider.\tIt is also stated that one Gulshan Malik PW6\nalso  informed\tV.K.  Goel that he had seen Vishal  and\t 5/6\nboys  quarrelling  near Kesar Sweet Restaurant and  that  he\nseparated  them.  He also disclosed the names of those\tboys\nas Arun, Aman, Sandeep,Vikram and Mandeep.  While continuing\nwith  the  search,  the complainant and\t others\t reached  at\nGurgaon\t canal and found a pair of chappal which V.K.\tGoel\nidentified  as belonging to his son Vishal.  Close- by\tthey\nnoticed\t trail\tof blood going up to the canal as also\tdrag\nmark.\tThe  matter  was reported to the police and  on\t the\nbasis  of  information given by the witnesses, FIR No.\t 221\nwas  lodged  on 16.3.1999 at about 7.00 p.m.  under  <a href=\"/doc/695990/\" id=\"a_7\">Section\n364</a>/<a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_8\">34</a>\tIPC.  After lodging the FIR, the police party  along\nwith  PW7,  PW11 and the complainant went to  Gurgaon  canal\nwhere  they  found a locket Om belonging to the\t deceased.\nIt  was sealed, marked and seized by the police.  Similarly,\nchappals were sealed, marked and seized.  Divers were called\nfrom  the  Fire Brigade Station, but despite  their  efforts\nthey could not locate the body as it was night.\t Thereafter,\non  17.3.1995,\tat about 10 a.m.  divers could\trecover\t the\ndead  body from the canal.  An autopsy on the dead body\t was\nconducted.   Dr.   V.K.\t Aggarwal PW5 found several  incised\nwounds\tand  opined  that  the death was due  to  shock\t and\nhaemorrhage as a result of injuries to the vital organ which\nwere  ante mortem in nature and sufficient to cause death in\nthe  ordinary course of nature.\t It is also the\t prosecution\nstory  that  on 18.3.1995, Sandeep, Vikram and Aman went  to\nthe  house  Laxmi  Narain  PW9 and made\t an  extra  judicial\nconfession  that they committed the murder of Vishal and his\nbody  was thrown in Gurgaon canal.  Accused further informed\nhim  that  they\t were  afraid  of the  police  as  they\t had\ncommitted  heinous  crime and requested him to produce\tthem\nbefore\tthe police.  He produced them before the police\t and\nthey  were  taken  into\t custody.  On  the  basis  of  their\ndisclosure  statements,\t recoveries were effected.   Sandeep\n(A1)  disclosed about the sword Ex.  P7, black pant  Ex.P22,\nblood  stained jacket Ex.  P.21, and sandow banian  Ex.P.23.\nVikram (A3) disclosed about the motor-cycle and clothes.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">    At\tthe time of hearing of these appeals, learned Senior\nCounsel\t Mr.   U.R.  Lalit appearing for  Sandeep  submitted\nthat  (1)  Courts  below  erred in  relying  upon  so-called\nconfession  before  PW9\t Laxmi Narain as  it  is  absolutely\nvague.\t  So  called  confession  no  where  indicates\t who\ncommitted  murder  and where it was committed.\tFor  proving\nthe  confession,  exact\t words uttered by  the\taccused\t are\nnecessary  to be proved.  In any set of circumstances, there\nwas  no reason for the accused to approach PW9 and make such\nconfession.  PW9 is not related or acquainted to the accused\nnor  having any status in the society or holding any post so\nas  to\tbe helpful to the accused.  Further, the say of\t PW9\nLaxmi  Narain that he handed over the accused to the  police\ninspector  does not find any corroboration from the evidence\nof  I.O.;  (2) Prosecution has failed to establish motive as\nnarrated  by  PW6  Gulshan  Kumar and the  same\t is  rightly\ndisbelieved  by the courts below as witness was not  knowing\nthe  accused  nor he was familiar with them;  (3) The  trial\ncourt had arrived at the conclusion that the prosecution has\nfailed\tto  prove  charge  of criminal\tconspiracy  and\t the\naccused\t were acquitted for the same.  Therefore, the  chain\nof circumstances, namely, last seen together and seeing them\ncoming\ttogether, upon which the prosecution relies is\talso\nweaken\tas two accused are acquitted by the High Court;\t (4)\nThe  prosecution case that despite the detailed FIR  stating\nthe  names  and addresses of the accused, being recorded  on\n16th  March, 1995 at 7 p.m., I.O.  did not arrest any of the\naccused\t named\tin  the FIR and that the  I.O.\t is  totally\nsilent with regard to the steps taken by him after recording\nof  the\t FIR, is not believable.  He submitted that if\tthis\npart is disbelieved, so-called recoveries at the instance of\naccused\t become\t suspicious.  In any case, recovery  is\t not\nproved by any independent witness as PW9 Laxmi Narain cannot\nbe  said to be an independent witness;\t(5) The evidence led\nby  the prosecution is that of all interested witnesses, who\nare  connected with the complainant V.K.  Goel in one way or\nthe  other.   He pointed out that evidence of V.K.  Goel  is\nnot  reliable because his version that he came to know about\nthe   arrest  of  accused  after   five\t days\tis   totally\nunbelievable  as  he  was in constant touch  with  the\tI.O.\nLearned counsel further pointed out that all the prosecution\nwitnesses have not specifically stated before the court that\nthey were knowing accused and if knowing since when and how.\nFurther,  as  there  was  no  identification  parade,  their\nevidence is not reliable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">    Learned  senior counsel Mr.\t Sushil Kumar appearing\t for\nArun  Bhatia  submitted that there is no evidence worth\t the\nname  for convicting Arun and, therefore, the High Court has\nrightly\t acquitted him.\t He has not made any confession.  He\npointed\t out that nothing was recovered from Arun Bhatia and\ncomplainant  has  named only four boys and he has not  named\nArun.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">    Mr.\t  Jaspal Singh, learned senior counsel appearing for\nMandeep\t adopted  the  aforesaid contentions raised  by\t the\nlearned\t counsel and in addition submitted that there is  no\nconfession  by\tMandeep and from the evidence on record\t the\nprosecution  has  failed to prove chain of circumstances  to\nconnect\t him  with  the crime.\tLearned\t counsel  Mr.\tS.N.\nBhardwaj   appearing  for  Vikram   adopted  the   aforesaid\ncontentions  raised by learned senior counsel Mr.  Lalit  as\nwell  as Mr.  Sushil Kumar and submitted that the High Court\nerred in convicting Vikram Singh.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">    As\tagainst\t this,\tlearned counsel Mr.   Mahabir  Singh\nappearing  for\tthe State at the outset submitted that\tsome\nlapses\ton  the\t part of I.O.  in not  carrying\t out  prompt\ninvestigation\twould\tnot  mean   that  evidence  of\t the\nprosecution  witnesses\tis not reliable.  He also  submitted\nthat it is true that Public Prosecutor has not taken care in\nbringing  on record the fact that accused were known to\t the\nwitnesses   but\t  considering  their\tevidence   and\t the\ncross-examination  it is apparent that accused were known to\nthe  witnesses and during the trial defence has not  doubted\ntheir identity by the witnesses at any point of time.  It is\nhis  contention that prosecution has fully proved the  chain\nof  circumstances which connect the accused with the  crime.\nFor this purpose, he relied upon the witnesses who have seen\nthe  accused  going and coming on motor-cycle  and  scooter,\nparticularly,  Sandeep\thaving sword in his hand.   He\talso\nrelied\tupon the evidence of PW6 and submitted that prior to\nthe commission of crime, an incident had taken place at 4 or\n4:30  p.m.   on\t the day of incident.  Apart from  this,  he\nreferred to cross-examination of PW13 V.K.  Goel, wherein it\nwas  suggested\tby the defence that because of\tthrowing  of\nacid  on a girl named Deepika, there was dispute between the\naccused\t and the deceased.  He pointed out that recovery  of\nblood-stained  sword and clothes of accused Sandeep  clearly\nestablishes  his  connection with the crime.   He  submitted\nthat  apart from the evidence of I.O.  as well as PW9  Laxmi\nNarain,\t even the evidence of DW1 corroborates the  recovery\nof clothes from the houses of Sandeep.\tFor Vikram Singh, it\nis  his\t contention that he was found alongwith Sandeep.   A\nmotor-cycle  was  found\t at  his   instance  and  that\t his\nblood-stained  clothes\twere also recovered.  For the  other\nacquitted  accused  Mandeep, he submitted that there  is  no\nreason to acquit him as from his house scooter was recovered\non the basis of his disclosure statement.  He contended that\naccused\t made confessional statements before PW9 who  handed\nover  the accused to the I.O.  and at that stage also in his\npresence accused made confessional statements and thereafter\nthey  were arrested by the I.O.\t The learned counsel for the\ncomplainant also supported the aforesaid contentions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">    In\tour  view,  submission of learned  counsel  for\t the\nappellants  that the courts below erred in relying upon\t the\nconfessional  statement\t made  by Sandeep before  PW9  Laxmi\nNarain\trequires  to  be   accepted.   Alleged\tconfessional\nstatement  narrated  by\t the witness PW9 is limited  to\t the\nextent\tthat  Sandeep, Vikram and Aman came to his house  at\n9.30  a.m.   on 18th March, 1995.  Sandeep told him that  on\n15th March, they committed the murder of Vishal Goel and his\nbody  was thrown in Gurgaon canal near bypass Sectors 9\t and\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">13.   They  also informed him that they were afraid  of\t the\npolice\tand requested him to produce them before the police.\nIt  is his say that when he was going along with the accused\nto  inform the police, police met him at T-point of Sector 8\nand 9, Faridabad and accused were handed over to the police.\nFrom  the  aforesaid version of the witness it\tis  apparent\nthat   neither\tVikram\tnor   Aman  made  any\tconfessional\nstatement.   Hence,  it\t is  difficult\t to  arrive  at\t the\nconclusion  that  Vikram  and  Aman  made  any\tconfessional\nstatement.   Only  Sandeep told the witness that  they\thave\ncommitted  the murder of Vishal Goel.  Further, the  learned\ncounsel\t is right in submitting that there was no  necessity\nfor  Sandeep  and  other accused to go at the  residence  of\nLaxmi  Narain,\tmore  so when Laxmi Narain was\tnot  closely\nacquainted with the accused nor was having any status in the\nsociety so that he could be helpful to them.  On this aspect\nprosecution  has not brought anything on record to point out\nthe  reason  as\t to why Sandeep and others had gone  at\t the\nhouse  of PW9.\tIn cross-examination witness stated that  he\nwas  a member of Lions Club and that Vikram had visited\t his\nhouse  2-3 times and last time 2 ½ months prior to the\tdate\nof  occurrence.\t  He  has also stated that  he\twas  knowing\nSandeep\t prior to his visit at his residence.  It is his say\nthat he met him in a restaurant and both of them took snacks\nand  he\t made payment.\tConsidering the entire\tevidence  of\nthis  witness, in our view, the prosecution has not  brought\non  record any reason for the accused to go at the residence\nof Laxmi Narain to confess their crime.\t Therefore, the said\nconfessional statements cannot be relied upon.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">    However,  there  is no reason to disbelieve the  say  of\nthis  witness that Sandeep made confessional statement\tthat\nthe  dead  body of Vishal Goel was thrown in  Gurgaon  canal\nnear   bypass\tSectors\t 9  and\t 13  and  that\t sword\t and\nblood-stained  clothes\twere kept at his residence.  On\t the\ndisclosure statement of Sandeep, blood stained sword wrapped\nin  red\t cover,\t one black pant and jacket of  fauji  colour\nstained\t with  blood were recovered from his house.  On\t the\nbasis  of  disclosure  statement  of  Vikram,  blood-stained\nT-shirt\t and a motor-cycle bearing No.HR-29 E/3698 parked at\nthe  ground  floor of his house near garage were  recovered.\nFurther discovery of articles from the house of Sandeep gets\ncorroboration from the evidence led by the accused.  Accused\nled  the evidence of DW1 Jai Bhagwan Singh Dahiya who was at\nSecurity  service  in Sector-9, for contending that  accused\nSandeep\t was  arrested on 16.3.1995 and not on 18.3.1995  as\nstated\tby  the prosecution.  It is say of DW1 that on\t16th\nMarch,\the  learnt  that  one boy was murdered\tand  son  of\nMahender  Sharma, namely Sandeep was involved in the  crime.\nHe  had gone at the house of Mahender Sharma at about  10.15\np.m.   In the meantime, S.I.  Bhagat Singh accompanied\twith\n2/3  other police officers arrived at his house.  It is\t his\nsay  that  Sandeep was handcuffed along with one other\tboy.\nThe  witness admitted that police enquired about the clothes\nof  Sandeep  when  he  was sitting in the  drawing  room  of\nMahender  Sharma.  Sandeep brought clothes consisting of one\njacket,\t sandow\t baniyan of blue colour, one black pant\t and\nthereafter the police along with the accused left the place.\nIn  cross-examination,\the admitted that he was on  visiting\nterms  with Mahender Sharma for the last many years and that\nhe  came to know about the murder at about 4/5 p.m.  on 16th\nMarch,\t1995.  He also came to know about the involvement of\nSandeep\t in murder case at 10 p.m.  Mahender Sharma and\t his\nwife  were  present  in their house when  police  came.\t  He\nadmitted  that he had not disclosed this version to  anybody\nand  was  not summoned as a witness, but at the instance  of\nMahender Sharma he appeared as a witness.  This evidence, in\nour  view,  amply  corroborates that  Investigating  Officer\ndiscovered  the\t blood-stained\tclothes from  the  house  of\nSandeep\t in  presence  of his parents.\tOnce  this  part  of\ndiscovery is believed, then there is no reason to disbelieve\nthe evidence of Laxmi Narain who was present at the house of\nSandeep\t when the discoveries as stated above were made.  He\nhas  stated  that  on the disclosure by Sandeep,  they\twere\ntaken  at  his residence and Sandeep produced blood  stained\nsword and clothes in presence of his parents and the witness\nhad attested the recovery memos.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">    Further, The prosecution has also produced on record the\nreport\tof Assistant Director, (Serology), Forensic  Science\nLab,  Haryana who found stains of human blood in the  earth,\nshirt, T-shirts, pant, sweater, underwear and sword.  As per\nthe  FSL  report, the said articles were found stained\twith\nhuman blood of B-Group which was also the blood group on the\narticles recovered from the dead body of Vishal Goel.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">    In\tour  view, the High Court erred in disbelieving\t the\nevidence  of  PW6 Gulshan Kumar in its entirety.  It is\t the\nsay of PW6 that at about 4/4.30 p.m., near Kesar Restaurant,\nhe saw Vishal Goel and 5-6 boys quarrelling with each other.\nVishal\tGoel was caught by 4-5 boys, who were present in the\ncourt,\tand he separated them.\tIn cross-examination, he has\nstated\tthat  he was not knowing them prior to the  incident\nand  that  he was knowing Vishal Goel and his  father  since\nyears.\t May  be  that, on the date of incident he  was\t not\nknowing\t the  names  of the boys who were  quarrelling\twith\ndeceased  but  that would not, in any way, falsify  his\t say\nthat  Vishal  and 5-6 boys were quarrelling with each  other\nand  that he separated them.  Even in chief- examination, he\nhas  not  stated  the names of accused.\t However,  the\tHigh\nCourt rightly appreciated the evidence of PW11 Manish Sharma\nwho  has  stated  that at about 7.30 p.m.  on  the  date  of\nincident,  he  saw  accused  Sandeep and  Arun\tgoing  on  a\nmotor-cycle  having  the same number which was recovered  at\nthe  instance  of  Vikram.  This  witness  has\tspecifically\nstated\tthat he was knowing deceased Vishal Goel as he was a\ntenant\tin the house of V.K.  Goel.  He has also stated that\nhe  was\t knowing Sandeep and Arun since he became tenant  at\nthe  house of V.K.  Goel.  There is no reason to  disbelieve\nthe  evidence  of this witness.\t The evidence is  consistent\nwith  the  evidence  of complainant who has stated  that  at\nabout  7.30  p.m.  when his son Vishal Goel was\t taking\t his\nmeals,\tsomeone\t called him from outside and  thereafter  he\nleft  the house.  Next day, V.K.  Goel was informed by\tPW11\nManish\tSharma\tthat he had seen his son in the\t company  of\nSandeep\t and  Arun at 7.30 p.m.\t on a motor-cycle.   Further\nthere  is evidence on record of Bankey Lal PW7 that on\t15th\nMarch  when he alongwith Bhuneshwar Goel was walking on\t the\nroad  leading to Sector 9 and 13, at about 8.30 p.m., he saw\nSandeep,  Aman\tand Arun on a motor-cycle.  Motor-cycle\t was\ndriven\tby Arun and Sandeep was having a sword in his  hand.\nHe also saw Mandeep driving a scooter and Vikram was pillion\nrider.\t The  motor-cycle and scooter were coming  from\t the\nside of canal in a fast speed.\tOn the next day when he came\nto  know  that Vishal Goel was missing, he accompanied\tV.K.\nGoel  in  search  of him towards canal and found a  pair  of\nchappal\t of brown colour and blood on the earth.  One locket\nof Om was also found there and they noticed dragging marks\non  the\t spot  up to the canal.\t In  cross-examination,\t the\nwitness\t has stated that he was on visiting terms with\tV.K.\nGoel  and had gone at his house on number of occasions as he\nwas  residing in neighbourhood.\t He has also stated that the\naccused\t boys have been visiting the house of V.K.  Goel and\nhe was knowing their names as he had heard them talking with\neach  other.  As the evidence of the aforesaid two witnesses\nis consistent, cogent and reliable, it would be difficult to\naccept\tthe  contention of the learned counsel that  because\nthey  knew  V.K.  Goel, therefore, they are  interested\t and\ntheir  evidence\t is not reliable.  In case where the  victim\nand  accused  are known to a witness, his evidence would  be\nmaterial  and  cannot  be  criticized that  as\twitness\t was\nknowing the father of the accused, he is interested witness.\nIn  the present case, as the witnesses knew the deceased  as\nwell  as  the  accused persons, they were in a\tposition  to\ninform the complainant and also to identify the accused.  In\nsuch   a   case\t there\twas  no\t question  of\tholding\t  an\nidentification\tparade.\t  The\taforesaid  evidence  clearly\nestablishes  that the deceased was last seen in the  company\nof  Sandeep and others after leaving the house at about 7.30\np.m.   Thereafter, Sandeep having sword and others were seen\ncoming\tback  from the canal side by Bankey Lal, PW7.\tFrom\nthe  house  of Sandeep blood-stained sword and clothes\twere\ndiscovered.    Similarly,  the\t bloodstained  T-shirt\t was\ndiscovered  from the house of Vikram and from the garage  of\nhis  house,  motor-cycle  bearing No.HR-29 E/3698  was\talso\nrecovered.   PW5  Dr.  Aggarwal carried out the\t post-mortem\nand found as many as 10 incised wounds which could be caused\nby  a sword.  The sword and the clothes which were recovered\nwere found stained with blood of B group which is also the\nblood  group  found from the earth lifted from the spot\t and\nfrom the articles found on the body of deceased Vishal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">    In\tview of the aforesaid circumstantial evidence proved\nby  the\t prosecution,  even if we discard  the\tconfessional\nstatement  made by accused Sandeep before PW9 Laxmi  Narain,\nthe  High Court was right in convicting accused Sandeep (A1)\nand  Vikram  Singh (A3).  Further, the High Court held\tthat\nagainst\t Mandeep and Arun, except seeing them together while\ncoming\tback  by PW7, there is no other evidence to  connect\nthem with the crime and that there was no discovery of blood\nstained\t articles  at  their  instance.\t  Hence,  they\twere\nacquitted.   But that would not in any way adversely  affect\nthe  prosecution  evidence qua A1 and A3.  It is  also\ttrue\nthat  despite  the  detailed  FIR,  the\t IO  has  not  taken\nimmediate  steps for arresting the accused named in the FIR.\nBut  sluggishness  in  investigation would not\tin  any\t way\nadversely  affect the evidence of complainant-PW13, PW7\t and\nPW11.\tIn this view of the matter, the finding recorded  by\nthe High Court convicting A1 and A3 and acquitting A2 and A4\ndoes not call for any interference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">    In the result, the appeals are dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">(M.B.
