(2)\nSheo Narain  Sharma, (3)  Ram Kumar  Upadhyaya, (4)  Jagdish\nSingh&#x27;s nephew-Paras  Singh of\tBirampur, (5)  Hare  Krishna\nSingh&#x27;s brother-in-law,\t Paras Nath  Singh of  Dhobaha,\t the\nappellants and\ttwo more  whom he  could not  identify.\t All\nthese persons were armed with rifle, gun and pistol and were\nstanding near  the northern side of the eastern gate, of the\nHospital. At  that time\t two Rickshaws\twere coming from the\neastern side.  In the  front rickshaw  the deceased-Jitendra\nChoudhary, was\tsitting along with another person and in the\nrear rickshaw  were his\t two sisters,  PW I and PW 2. As the\nrickshaw of  the deceased came close to these seven persons,\nHare Krishna  Singh fired  at the  deceased  from  his\tgun,\nwhereupon the  latter fell  down from  the rickshaw with the\nrifle which  he was  carrying. The  other persons also fired\nupon the  deceased as  a result of which he died. After that\nHare Krishna  Singh picked  up the rifle of the deceased and\ntook to\t his heels.  After investigation by PW 9, the charge\nsheet was submitted against all the appellants and they were\nput up for trial.\n     The prosecution examined as many as 9 witnesses of whom\nPWs. 1,\t 2, 3  and 8  were eye witnesses. The defence of the\nappellant-Hare\n2\nKrishna Singh  was that\t while he  was going  to Patna along\nwith appellant-Ram  Kumar Upadhyaya and one Madan Singh in a\nrickshaw, and  that when  the rickshaw in which the deceased\nwas travelling\tcame close to him, the deceased fired at him\nand that  he sustained\tinjuries. He examined five witnesses\nDWs. 1 to 5, to prove the nature of injury sustained by him.\nThe defence  of Paras  Singh of\t Dhobaha was that he had not\nvisited the  village for  the last  fifteen years, while the\ndefence of  the other  remaining appellants  was a denial of\ntheir complicity in the crime.\n     The Additional  Sessions Judge accepted the prosecution\ncase, and  convicted and sentenced the appellants to various\nperiods of imprisonment.\n     On appeal by the appellants the High Court affirmed the\nconvictions and sentences.\n     In the  appeals by\t certificate to\t this Court  it\t was\ncontended: (a) on behalf of Hare Krishna Singh, appellant in\nCrl. A.\t No. 690/82  that the  prosecution having  failed to\nexplain the  injury sustained  by Hare\tKrishna Singh in the\nsame occurrence,  such\tinjury\tbeing  a  serious  one,\t the\nprosecution witnesses  should be  disbelieved, and  that  in\nsuch circumstances  it should  be held\tthat the plea of the\nappellant of self-defense shall be probabilised and that the\nprosecution must  have withheld\t the true  facts as  to\t the\ngenesis and  origin of the occurrence, and that in any event\na great\t doubt had been cast on the prosecution case and the\nbenefit of that doubt should go to the appellant.\n     (b) on behalf of Paras Singh of Birampur, the nephew of\nJagdish Singh,\tthe sole appellant in Cr. A. No. 616/82 that\nin the\tFIR his\t name was not mentioned, that PW 3 failed to\nidentify him  in the  T.I. Parade,  that PW 8 did not attend\nthe T.I.  Parade, and that he was not present at the time of\noccurrence.\n     (c) on  behalf of\tSheo  Narain  Sharma  the  remaining\nappellant in  Crl. A.  No. 690/82  and Ram  Kumar Upadhayaya\nsole appellant in Crl. A. No. 615/82, that no specific overt\nact had\t been attributed to either of them and the fact that\nthey were  found in  the company  of Hare  Krishna Singh and\nParas Singh  of Dhobaha\t could not  be sufficient  to impute\ncommon intention to them.\n     Dismissing Criminal Appeal No. 690 of 1982 in so far as\nit relates to Hare Krishna Singh and Paras Singh of Dhobaha,\nand allowing it in\n3\nrespect of  Sheo Narain Sharma and acquitting him of all the\ncharges; and  allowing Crl.  A. Nos. 615 and 616 of 1982 and\nsetting aside  the convictions\tand sentences  of Ram  Kumar\nUpadhayaya and\tParas Singh  of Birampur and acquitting them\nof all the charges.\n^\n     HELD:  1.\tIt  is\tnot  an\t invariable  rule  that\t the\nprosecution has\t to explain  the injuries  sustained by\t the\naccused in  the same  occurrence. The  burden of proving the\nguilt of  the accused is undoubtedly on the prosecution. The\naccused is  not\t bound\tto  say\t anything  in  defence.\t The\nprosecution has to prove the guilt of the accused beyond all\nreasonable doubts.  If the  witnesses examined\ton behalf of\nthe prosecution\t are believed  by the  court in proof of the\nguilt of  the  accused\tbeyond\tany  reasonable\t doubt,\t the\nquestion of the obligation of the prosecution to explain the\ninjuries sustained by the accused will not arise. [12E-F]]\n     2. When the prosecution comes with a definite case that\nthe offence has been committed by the accused and proved its\ncase  beyond   any  reasonable\t doubt,\t it  becomes  hardly\nnecessary for  the prosecution\tto again  explain how and in\nwhat circumstances  the injuries  have been inflicted on the\nperson of the accused. [12G]\n     3. Simply\tbecause the accused has received injuries in\nthe same occurrence, it cannot be taken for granted that the\ndeceased  or  the  injured  person  was\t the  aggressor\t and\nconsequently, he  had to defend himself by inflicting injury\non the deceased or the injured person. [13B-C]\n     4. It  is not  the law or invariable rule that whenever\nthe accused  sustains an  injury in  the same occurrence the\nprosecution has\t to explain  the injuries  failure of  which\nwill mean  that the prosecution has suppressed the truth and\nalso the origin and genesis of the occurrence. [13D-E]]\n     5. Common\tintention under\t <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_2\">section 34</a>  IPC is  not  by\nitself an  offence. But, it creates a joint and constructive\nliability for  the crime  committed in\tfurtherance of\tsuch\ncommon intention. [16E-F]\n     6. As  no overt  act whatsoever  has been attributed to\nthe appellants,\t Ram Kumar Upadhyaya and Sheo Narain Sharma,\nit is  difficult to  hold, in the facts and circumstances of\nthe case,  that they  had shared  the common  intention with\nHare Krishna  Singh and\t Paras Singh  of Dhobaha. When these\ntwo appellants\twere very much known to the eye witnesses PW\n3 and 8 non-mention of their names in the evidence as to\n4\n     their participation in firing upon the deceased, throws\na great\t doubt as  to their sharing of the common intention.\nThe conviction\tand sentences of these two appellants cannot\ntherefore be  sustained. They are therefore acquitted of all\nthe charges. [16F-G]\n     7. The  Additional Sessions  Judge has not believed the\ncase of\t R Hare Krishna Singh that he had sustained a bullet\ninjury in  the same  occurrence and  he\t has  given  reasons\ntherefor. The  High Court  has, however, come to the finding\nthat Hare  Krishna Singh  was admitted in the hospital in an\ninjured condition  immediately after  the occurrence. In the\nfacts and  circumstances of  the case the prosecution is not\nobliged to  account for\t the injury  and that the failure of\nthe prosecution\t to give  a reasonable\texplanation  of\t the\ninjury would  not go  against or  throw\t any  doubt  on\t the\nprosecution case. All the eye witnesses have stated that the\nappellant Hare Krishna Singh had fired on Jitendra Choudhary\nas a result of which he died. The prosecution witnesses have\nbeen believed  by the  Additional Sessions  Judge  and\tHigh\nCourt. In  these circumstances it cannot be thought that the\nmaterials on  record including the statement of Hare Krishna\nSingh under section 313 Cr. P.C. probablise any case of self\ndefence or that the deceased had inflicted on him the injury\nby firing  at him from his rifle. The appellant Hare Krishna\nSingh has  therefore, been  rightly convicted and sentenced.\n[13E-G; 14B-C, F]\n     8. As  regards Paras Singh of Dhobaha he was found with\nthe accused  persons including Hare Krishna Singh. It is not\ndisputed that he is the brother-in-law of Hare Krishna Singh\nas has\tbeen described\tin the\tFIR. It\t is the\t categorical\nevidence of  PWs. 1,  2, 3 and 8 that Paras Singh of Dhobaha\nhad fired  at the deceased. He has been identified by PW1 in\nthe T.I.  Parade. In  these circumstances there is no reason\nto interfere  with the\torder  of  conviction  and  sentence\npassed by the Courts below. [14F-G]]\n     9. The  prosecution has  not been\table to identify the\nappellant Paras\t Singh of  Birampur with  the description of\nJagdish Singh&#x27;s\t nephew as given in the FIR. PW. 3 failed to\nidentify the  appellant in  the T.I.  Parade. PW.  8 did not\nattend the  T.I. Parade.  In such  circumstances,  the\tHigh\nCourt was  not justified  and committed\t an error  of law in\nrelying upon  the statements  of PWs 3 and 8 made before the\npolice mentioning  the names of Paras Singh of Birampur. The\nprosecution has\t failed to  prove the  complicity  of  Paras\nSingh of  Birampur in  the crime  and that he was present at\nthe time  of occurrence.  His conviction and sentence cannot\ntherefore be sustained and are set aside. He is acquitted of\nall the charges. [15C-F]\n5\n     Bhaba Nanda Sharma v.

The accused included two persons having\nthe same  name Paras Singh, one of Village Dhobaha, brother-\nin-law of  Hare Krishna\t Singh, one  of\t the  appellants  in\nCriminal Appeal\t No. 690  of 1982,  and the other of Village\nBirampur and  nephew of\t Jagdish  Singh,  the  appellant  in\nCriminal Appeal\t No. 616 of 1982. We shall hereinafter refer\nto\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">6</span>\nthe said  two persons as &#x27;Paras Singh of Dhobaha&#x27; and &#x27;Paras\nSingh of Birampur&#x27; respectively.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">     The prosecution case as appearing from the Fardbeyan or\nthe FIR\t lodged by  one Sarabjit  Tiwary (P.W.\t3), a social\nworker, on 12.12.1987 in the Arrah Sadar Police Station, was\nthat on\t that day  at about  7.00 A.M.\the was\tgoing to his\nbrother-in-law Raghubir\t Mishra and just he reached near the\nmain gate  of the  Sadar Hospital,  he\tsaw  seven  persons,\nnamely, &quot;(1)  Hare Krishna  Singh, resident of Dhanpura; (2)\nSheo Narain  Sharma, resident  of Berkhembe  Gali;  (3)\t Ram\nKumar Upadhyaya,  resident of  village Dumaria;\t (4) Jagdish\nSingh&#x27;s nephew of Birampur in military service; (5) brother-\nin-law of Hare Krishna Singh of Dhobaha in military service&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">and two\t more persons  whom he\tcould not  identify. All the\nsaid persons were armed with rifle, gun and pistol, and were\nstanding near  northern side  of the  eastern  gate  of\t the\nhospital. At  that time,  two Rickshaws were coming from the\neastern side.  In the front Rickshaw, Jitendra Choudhary and\nanother person named Lallan Rai, Resident of village Maniya,\nwere sitting  and in the rear Rickshaw there were two girls.\nAs the\tRickshaw of Jitendra Choudhary came near the persons\nmentioned above,  all of  a sudden, Hare Krishna Singh fired\nat Jitendra  Choudhary from  his gun,  whereupon the  latter\nfell down  from the  Rickshaw with  the rifle  which he\t was\ncarrying  with\thim.  The  other  persons  also\t fired\tupon\nJitendra Choudhary  along with\tHare  Krishna  Singh,  as  a\nresult of  which he  died. After  that\tHare  Krishna  Singh\npicked up  the rifle  of Jitendra Choudhary and touching his\nbody said, &quot;He is dead, let us take to our heels&quot;. It may be\nmentioned here\tthat  the  two\tgirls  referred\t to  in\t the\nFardbeyan or  FIR are  Premlata Choudhary (P.W. 1) and Sobha\nChoudhary  (P.W.   2),\tsisters\t of  the  deceased  Jitendra\nChoudhary.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     After investigation  by P.W.  9,  the  chargesheet\t was\nsubmitted against  all the  appellants and  they were put up\nfor trial.  The prosecution examined as many as 9 witnesses,\nof whom\t P.Ws. 1, 2, 3 and 8 were eye witnesses. The defence\nof Hare\t Krishna Singh\twas that he was going to Patna along\nwith the  appellant Ram\t Kumar Upadhyaya and one Madan Singh\nin a Rickshaw and when the Rickshaw reached near the shop of\nSita Ram, he received a bullet from behind and fell down. He\nlooked back  and saw  that one\tDipu Prasad and Ram Lal were\nfiring. He  also saw the deceased Jitendra Choudhary, Chhatu\nChoudhary and  Lallan Rai  (P.W. 8)  firing from the eastern\ngate of the Hospital. He examined five witnesses, D.Ws. 1 to\n5, to prove the nature of injury sustained by him.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">7</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     The defence  of Paras  Singh of Dhobaha was that he had\nnot visited the village Dhanpura for the last fifteen years.\nThe defence  of other  appellants is  also a denial of their\ncomplicity in the crime.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     The  learned   Additional\tSessions   Judge,  after  an\nelaborate discussion and analysis of the evidence adduced on\nbehalf of  the parties,\t accepted the  prosecution case\t and\nconvicted and  sentenced the  appellants as mentioned above.\nRegarding the  injury sustained\t by Hare  Krishna Singh, the\nlearned Additional  Sessions Judge was of the view that such\ninjury had been deliberately introduced by him and held that\nhe was\tnot injured  in the  occurrence. On  appeal  by\t the\nappellants, the\t High Court  affirmed their  convictions and\nsentences. Hence these appeals be special leave.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     It is  contended by Mr. Garg, learned Counsel appearing\non behalf  of Hare  Krishna Singh,  one of the appellants in\nCriminal Appeal No. 690 of 1982, that the prosecution having\nfailed to  explain the\tinjury sustained by the appellant in\nthe same  occurrence, such  injury being  a serious one, the\nprosecution witnesses should be disbelieved. Counsel submits\nthat in\t such circumstances, it should be held that the plea\nof the\tappellant of self-defence has been probabilised, and\nthat the prosecution must have withheld the true facts as to\nthe genesis  and origin\t of the\t occurrence. Further,  it is\nsubmitted that\tin any\tevent, it  has cast a great doubt on\nthe prosecution case and the benefit of that doubt should go\nto the appellant.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"807023\" id=\"span_3\">The question,  however, is\t whether it is an invariable\nrule that whenever an accused sustains an injury in the same\noccurrence, the prosecution is obliged to explain the injury\nand on\tthe  failure  of  the  prosecution  to\tdo  so,\t the\nprosecution case should be disbelieved. Before answering the\nquestion we may refer to a few decisions of this Court cited\nat the\tBar. Mr.  Garg has  placed much\t reliance  upon\t the\ndecision of  this Court\t in <a href=\"/doc/807023/\" id=\"a_7\">Lakshmi Singh v. State of Bihar</a>,\n[1976] 4  SCC 394.  In\tthat  case,  the  accused  sustained\ninjuries  in   the  same  occurrence.  Fazal  Ali,  J.,\t who\ndelivered the  judgment\t of  the  Court,  observed  that  no\nindependent witness  had been examined by the prosecution to\nsupport the  participation of  the appellant in the assault.\nFurther, it  was observed  that the evidence of P.Ws. 1 to 4\nclearly showed\tthat they  gave graphic\t description of\t the\nassault with  regard to\t the order, the manner and the parts\nof  the\t  body\twith  absolute\tconsistency  which  gave  an\nimpression that\t they had given a parrot-like version acting\nunder a conspiracy to depose to one set of facts and one set\nof facts  only. In view of the nature of evidence of P.Ws. 1\nto 4, this\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">8</span>\nCourt accepted the contention made on behalf of the accused,\nparticularly taking  the entire\t picture  of  the  narrative\ngiven by  the witnesses,  that P.Ws.  1 to  4  had  combined\ntogether to  implicate the  accused falsely  because of\t the\nlong-standing  litigation   between  them   and\t  the\tsaid\nwitnesses. Thereafter,\tthe Court  considered  the  injuries\nthat were  inflicted on\t the person  of the  accused Dasrath\nSingh and  laid down  that where  the prosecution  fails  to\nexplain the injuries on the accused, two results follow: (1)\nthat the  evidence of the prosecution witness is untrue; and\n(2) that  the injuries\tprobabilise the\t plea taken  by\t the\nappellants.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1935279\" id=\"span_5\">The\t principle of  law <a href=\"/doc/807023/\" id=\"a_8\">laid\t down in</a> the earlier\ndecision of  this Court\t in <a href=\"/doc/1935279/\" id=\"a_9\">Mohar  Rai v.

This Court  held that\t once it was proved that the\nempties recovered  from the  scene could not have been fired\nfrom Ex.  III, the  prosecution case that those empties were\nfired from Ex.

Thereafter,\nthe injuries  sustained by the two appellants, Mohar Rai and\nBharath Rai,  were considered  by the Court and it held that\nthe prosecution had failed to explain the injuries sustained\nby the\tappellants and\tobserved that  the  failure  of\t the\nprosecution to\toffer any  explanation in that regard showed\nthat the  evidence of  prosecution witnesses relating to the\nincident was  not true\tor, at\tany rate,  not wholly  true.\nThus, in  this case  also the question of non-explanation of\nthe injuries  on the  accused was  considered by  the  Court\nafter it  had rejected,\t on a consideration of evidence, the\nprosecution case  that Mohar Rai had fired from the revolver\n(Ex. III).  In other words, if the prosecution case had been\nbelieved that the appellant Mohar Rai had fired from Ex. III\ninjuring  P.W.\t 1,  the  non-explanation  of  the  injuries\nsustained  by  the  accused  would  not\t have  affected\t the\nprosecution case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1508303\" id=\"span_11\">On the  other hand,  in <a href=\"/doc/1508303/\" id=\"a_19\">Bhaba  Nanda Sharma v.

In  rejecting the  contention of  the accused, this\nCourt pointed  out that not only the plea of private defence\nwas not\t taken by  the accused\tin  their  statements  under\nsection 342 Cr. P.C., but no basis for that plea was laid in\nthe cross-examination  of the  prosecution witnesses  or  by\nadducing any  defence  evidence.  As  regards  the  injuries\nsustained by  one of  the accused,  this Court\tobserved  as\nfollows:</span></span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\t  &quot;In material particulars the evidence of the three\n\t  eye  witnesses  as  also  the\t evidence  of  dying\n\t  declaration of  the deceased before P.W. Gulamnabi\n\t  is so\t convincing and natural that no doubt creeps\n\t  into it  for the  failure of\tthe  prosecution  to\n\t  explain the  injuries on  the person of respondent\n\t  No. 1.  The prosecution  case is not shaken at all\n\t  on that account.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">     We have  referred to  the above decisions in extenso in\norder to consider whether it is an invariable proposition of\nlaw that  the prosecution is obliged to explain the injuries\nsustained by  the accused in the same occurrence and whether\nfailure of the prosecution to so explain the injuries on the\nperson of  the accused\twould mean  that the prosecution has\nsuppressed the\ttruth and  also the genesis or origin of the\noccurrence. Upon  a conspectus\tof the\tdecisions  mentioned\nabove, we  are of  the view  that the  question\t as  to\t the\nobligation  of\tthe  prosecution  to  explain  the  injuries\nsustained by  the accused  in the  same occurrence  may\t not\narise in  each and  every case. In other words, it is not an\ninvariable rule\t that the  prosecution has  to\texplain\t the\ninjuries sustained  by the  accused in\tthe same occurrence.\nThe  burden   of  proving   the\t guilt\tof  the\t accused  is\nundoubtedly on\tthe prosecution. The accused is not bound to\nsay anything  in defence.  The prosecution  has to prove the\nguilt of  the accused  beyond all  reasonable doubts. If the\nwitnesses examined on behalf of the prosecution are believed\nby the court in proof of the guilt of the accused beyond any\nreasonable doubt,  the question\t of the\t obligation  of\t the\nprosecution to explain the injuries sustained by the accused\nwill not  arise. When  the prosecution comes with a definite\ncase that  the offence has been committed by the accused and\nproves its  case beyond\t any reasonable\t doubt,\t it  becomes\nhardly necessary  for the  prosecution to  again explain how\nand in\twhat circumstances  injuries have  been inflicted on\nthe person of the accused.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1479705\" id=\"span_25\">The accused  may take  the plea of the right of private\ndefence which  means that  he had  inflicted injury  on\t the\ndeceased or the injured\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">13</span>\nperson in exercise of his right of private defence. In other\nwords, his  plea may  be that  the deceased  or the  injured\nperson was the aggressor and inflicted injury on the accused\nand in order to defend himself from being the victim of such\naggression, he\thad inflicted injury on the aggressor in the\nexercise of  his right\tof private defence. As has been held\nin <a href=\"/doc/1479705/\" id=\"a_34\">Munshi  Ram</a>&#x27;s case (supra) the burden of establishing the\nplea of private defence is on the accused and the burden can\nbe discharged  by showing  preponderance of probabilities in\nfavour of  that plea on the basis of the material on record.\nIt, therefore,\tfollows that  simply because the accused has\nreceived injuries in the same occurrence, it cannot be taken\nfor granted  that the deceased or the injured person was the\naggressor and  consequently, he\t had to\t defend\t himself  by\ninflicting injury on the deceased or the injured person.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">     All  the  decisions  of  this  Court  which  have\tbeen\nreferred to  and discussed  above, show\t that when the court\nhas believed  the prosecution  witnesses as  convincing\t and\ntrustworthy, the  court\t overruled  the\t contention  of\t the\naccused that  as the  prosecution had  failed to explain the\ninjuries sustained  by the  accused in\tthe same occurrence,\nthe prosecution\t case should  be disbelieved and the accused\nshould be  acquitted. Thus,  it is not the law or invariable\nrule that  whenever the\t accused sustains  an injury  in the\nsame occurrence, the prosecution has to explain the injuries\nfailure\t of   which  will  mean\t that  the  prosecution\t has\nsuppressed the\ttruth and also the origin and genesis of the\noccurrence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">     The learned  Additional Sessions Judge has not believed\nthe case  of Hare  Krishna Singh  that he  had\tsustained  a\nbullet injury  in the  same  occurrence\t and  he  has  given\nreasons therefor.  The High  Court has, however, come to the\nfinding that Hare Krishna Singh was admitted in the hospital\nin an injured condition immediately after the occurrence. We\ndo not\tpropose to  reassess evidence  on the question as to\nwhether Hare  Krishna Singh had sustained any injury or not.\nWe may\tassume that  he had sustained a bullet injury in the\nsame  occurrence.   But,  even\t then,\tin   the  facts\t and\ncircumstances of  the case  the prosecution, in our opinion,\nis not\tobliged to  account for\t the  injury  and  that\t the\nfailure of  the prosecution to give a reasonable explanation\nof the injury would not go against or throw any doubt on the\nprosecution case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">     The injury that was sustained by Hare Krishna Singh was\non the\tback. The  P.Ws. 1  and 2,  the two  sisters of\t the\ndeceased Jitendra  Choudhary, denied  the suggestion  put to\nthem on\t behalf of  Hare Krishna  Singh that  their  brother\nJitendra Choudhary had been shoot-\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">14</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">ing from  his rifle.  P.W. 3,  who is an independent witness\nand was\t present on the scene of occurrence, also denied the\nsuggestion of  the defence  that there\twas firing  on\tHare\nKrishna Singh. P.W. 8 Lallan Rai also denied such suggestion\nof the\tdefence. Hare  Krishna Singh  made a statement under\nsection 313 Cr. P.C. It is not his case that in self-defence\nhe had\tfired at  the deceased Jitendra Choudhary. He denied\nthat he\t had any  fire-arms with him or that he had fired at\nJitendra Choudhary.  He also denied that none of the accused\nhad any\t weapon with  him. All the eye-witnesses have stated\nthat the  appellant Hare Krishna Singh had fired on Jitendra\nChoudhary as  a result\tof which  he died.  The\t prosecution\nwitnesses have\tbeen  believed\tby  the\t learned  Additional\nSessions Judge\tand the High Court. In the circumstances, we\ndo not\tthink that  the materials  on record  including\t the\nstatement of  Hare Krishna Singh under section 313 Cr. P.C.,\nprobabilise any\t case of  self-defence or  that the deceased\nhad inflicted  on him  the injury  by firing at him from his\nrifle.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">     It may  be that  two empties  were found by the side of\nthe dead-body  of the  deceased,  but  the  High  Court\t has\nrightly observed  that the  presence of the empties does not\nnecessarily mean that the deceased had fired. The High Court\npoints out  that three\tlive cartridges\t were also recovered\nfrom the  pocket of  the deceased at the time of inquest and\nobserves that keeping of empty cartridges by the side of the\nbody of the deceased cannot be ruled out. We do not find any\ninfirmity in the view expressed by the High Court. It is not\nat all amenable to reason that the deceased had started from\nhis house along with his two sisters with a view to fighting\nwith the  accused. In  the circumstances, we are of the view\nthat the  appellant Hare  Krishna  Singh  has  been  rightly\nconvicted and sentenced as above.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">     Now we  may deal  with  the  case\tof  Paras  Singh  of\nDhobaha, one of the appellants in Criminal Appeal No. 690 of\n1982. He  was found  with the accused persons including Hare\nKrishna Singh. It is not disputed that he is the brother-in-\nlaw of\tHare Krishna  Singh, as he has been described in the\nFIR. It\t is the\t categorical evidence of P.Ws. 1, 2, 3 and 8\nthat Paras  Singh of  Dhobaha  had  fired  at  the  deceased\nJitendra Choudhary.  He has been identified by P.W. 1 in the\nT.I. Parade. In the circumstances, we do not find any reason\nto interfere  with the\torder  of  conviction  and  sentence\npassed by the courts below.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">     So far  as Paras  Singh  of  Birampur,  the  nephew  of\nJagdish Singh  and the sole appellant in Criminal Appeal No.\n616 of\t1982, is  concerned, his  case stands on a different\nfooting. Indeed, Mr. Rajender\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">15</span>\nSingh, the  learned  Counsel  appearing\t on  behalf  of\t the\nappellant,  has\t  challenged  the   very  presence   of\t the\nappellant,  Paras   Singh  of\tBirampur,  at  the  time  of\noccurrence.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">     In the  FIR, his  name has\t not been  mentioned, it has\nonly been  stated &quot;Jagdish Singh&#x27;s nephew who is in military\njob of\tBirampur&quot;. Jagdish  Singh may  have  more  than\t one\nnephew. The  I.O. (P.W.\t 9) in\this evidence has stated that\nbefore the  arrest of  Paras Singh  of Birampur,  he did not\nknow his  name and  he cannot  say how\tmany nephews Jagdish\nSingh\thas.\tThe   only    distinctive   particular\t for\nidentification, as  given in  the FIR, is that the nephew is\nin military  service. The  prosecution has  not adduced\t any\nevidence to  show that the appellant is in military service,\nand that  no other  nephew  of\tJagdish\t Singh\tis  in\tsuch\nservice. Thus, the prosecution has not been able to identify\nthe appellant  Paras Singh  of Birampur with the description\nof Jagdish  Singh&#x27;s nephew  as given  in the  FIR. The\tmost\nsignificant fact  is that  P.W. 3  failed  to  identify\t the\nappellant in the T.I. Parade. P.W. 8 did not attend the T.I.\nParade. His  case is  that he  was not\tcalled to attend the\nT.I. Parade.  On the other hand, it is the defence case that\nP.W. 8\twas called  but he  did not  attend the T.I. Parade.\nWhatever might\thave been  the reason, the fact remains that\nno attempt  was made  by the prosecution to have Paras Singh\nof Birampur identified by P.W. 8. In such circumstances, the\nHigh Court  was not  justified and committed an error of law\nin relying  upon the  statement of P.Ws. 3 and 8 made before\nthe police  mentioning the  name of Paras Singh of Birampur.\nIt is  true that  P.Ws. 3  and 8  identified Paras  Singh of\nBirampur in  court,  but  such\tidentification\tis  useless,\nparticularly in\t the face of the fact that P.W. 3 had failed\nto identify  him in  the T.I.  Parade. In the circumstances,\nthe prosecution\t has failed to prove the complicity of Paras\nSingh of  Birampur in the crime. Indeed, the prosecution has\nfailed to  prove that Paras Singh of Birampur was present at\nthe time  of occurrence. His conviction and sentence cannot,\ntherefore, be sustained.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">     Now we  may consider  the cases  of the  remaining\t two\naccused, namely, Sheo Narain Sharma, the remaining appellant\nin Criminal  Appeal No. 690 of 1982, and Ram Kumar Upadhaya,\nthe sole appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 615 of 1982. These\ntwo appellants have been convicted as a consequence of their\nsharing the common intention to murder the deceased Jitendra\nChoudhary. Both\t of them  have been  named in the FIR. It is\nsubmitted by  the learned  Counsel appearing  on  behalf  of\nthese two  appellants that  no specific\t overt act  has been\nattributed to either of them. It may be that they were found\nin the\tcompany of  Hare Krishna  Singh and  Paras Singh  of\nDhobaha but, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">16</span>\nlearned Counsel submits, that fact will not be sufficient to\nimpute common intention to them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">     So\t far   as  the\t appellant  Ram\t Kumar\tUpadhaya  is\nconcerned, there  is evidence that he went with Hare Krishna\nSingh, but  there is  no evidence  that he had also left the\nplace of  occurrence with him. It is the evidence of all the\neye-witnesses, namely, P.Ws. 1, 2, 3 and 8 that Hare Krishna\nSingh had  fired a  shot at the deceased Jitendra Choudhary,\nhitting him in the face and he rolled and fell down from the\nRickshaw in  front of  the gate.  Thereafter, Paras Singh of\nDhobaha also  fired  at\t the  deceased.\t After\tspecifically\nmentioning the\tnames of  Hare Krishna Singh and Paras Singh\nof Dhobaha  as persons who had fired at the deceased, P.W. 3\nstated that  thereafter two/three firings took place and all\nthe accused  went to  the shop\tof Sita\t Ram in front of the\ngate on\t the road  from where  they also fired upon Jitendra\nChoudhary. P.W.\t 8 in  his evidence  has also made a general\nstatement that\tall the accused started firing upon Jitendra\nChoudhary.  It\t is  not   readily  understandable  why\t the\nwitnesses did  not specifically\t mention the  names of\tSheo\nNarain Sharma and Ram Kumar Upadhaya, if they had also fired\nat the deceased. Except mentioning that these two appellants\nwere present, no overt act was attributed to either of them.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">     The question is whether the crime was committed by Hare\nKrishna Singh  and Paras  Singh of Dhobaha in furtherance of\nthe common  intention of  these two  appellants also. Common\nintention under\t <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_35\">section 34</a> IPC is not by itself an offence.\nBut, it\t creates a  joint and constructive liability for the\ncrime committed\t in furtherance of such common intention. As\nno  overt   act\t whatsoever   has  been\t attributed  to\t the\nappellants, Ram Kumar Upadhaya and Sheo Narain Sharma, it is\ndifficult to  hold, in\tthe facts  and circumstances  of the\ncase, that  they had  shared the  common intention with Hare\nKrishna Singh  and Paras  Singh of  Dhobaha.
