In brief, the relevant facts of the case are that deceased\nKoushal Prasad Dubey and eye witnesses of the incident are close\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     3</span>\n\n\n\n\nrelatives. There was a dispute between the appellants / accused\npersons and the complainant party with regard to the land which was\nearlier belonging to one Ramsakhi. On 5.7.1996 at about 7 am\nRambahore (PW-1) along with his cousin Koushal Prasad Dubey\n(deceased) and Ansuiya Prasad, and Ganga Prasad (PW-3) and labourer\nKalari Kol (PW-6) went to the disputed land situated at village Dihiya,\nPolice station Baikunthpur for cultivating the field whereupon firstly\nappellants Suresh and Bindawasi came with lathi and assaulted Koushal\nPrasad, due to which, he fell down. Thereafter, appellant Dinesh came\nwith farsa and assaulted Koushal Prasad and caused injury on his head.\nWhen Koushal Prasad made hue and cry, Ansuiya Prasad (PW-2), Ganga\nPrasad (PW-3) and Rambahore (PW-1) rushed towards him to rescue\nhim and following them, accused Bhimsen, Ramesh Patel and\nBhuvneshwar also came with lathi and assaulted them and during\nincident, other co-accused Ramadhar, Lalmani and Ramkhelawan also\nreached on the spot and assaulted them and wife of Koushal Prasad\nnamely Vidyawati also reached on the spot, she was also assaulted and\ncaused injury. Rambahore lodged FIR of the incident at Police Station\nBaikuntpur, District Rewa where crime no. 87/96 was registered for the\noffence under <a href=\"/doc/594493/\" id=\"a_15\">Sections 294</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1599401/\" id=\"a_16\">341</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_17\">323</a>, 506-B read with <a href=\"/doc/37788/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 34</a> of the\nIPC and injured Rambahore Sharma (PW-1), Ansuiya (PW-2) and Ganga\nPrasad (PW-3) were medically examined and condition of Koushal\nPrasad was serious. He was unconscious. Hence, he was referred to\nJabalpur Hospital where he succumbed to the injuries on 10.7.1996.\nDuring the investigation it was also found that accused Ramesh and\nLalmani were also involved in the incident. After completion of the\ninvestigation, charge sheet was filed before the JMFC; Sirmour who on\nits turn committed the case to the court of Sessions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">5.         On transfer, the case was tried by Second Additional\nSessions Judge, Rewa where the appellants / accused were charged for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                     4</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_19\">Sections 148</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_20\">302</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_21\">302</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_22\">149</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_23\">323</a>,\n<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_24\">323</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_25\">149</a> (in four counts) and 294 and 506-B of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_26\">IPC</a>. In the case\nappellant / accused Dinesh was absconded and learned trial Court vide\njudgment dated 20.4.2000 convicted and sentenced the appellants\nSuresh, Bindawasi and Ramadhar as mentioned earlier and acquitted\nother co-accused Ramesh Prasad, Lalmani and Ramkhelawan Patel of all\nthe charges and Bhuvneshwar and Bhimsen were convicted under\n<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 323</a> of the IPC and sentenced to six months RI and acquitted of\nthe other charge. Both the accused have not filed any appeal against\ntheir conviction and sentence. Later on, absconded appellant Dinesh\nPrasad was arrested and tried and vide judgment dated 31.10.2007 he\nwas convicted and sentenced as mentioned earlier.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_6\">6.          The defence of the appellant / accused Ramadhar is that on\nthe date of incident he was not present on the spot and other accused\npersons also took defence about their innocence and further claimed\nthat they assaulted the deceased and the witnesses in exercise of right\nto defence of the property. Hence, they have not committed any\noffence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">7.           On behalf of appellants Dinesh, Suresh and Bindawasi,\nfinding of the learned trial court have been challenged on the grounds\nthat the prosecution has failed to establish its case beyond reasonable\ndoubt as the statements of so called eye witnesses            are full of\ncontradictions and omissions and also against the medical evidence and\nthe circumstances, in which, the incident took place also indicate that\nthe appellants / accused persons assaulted in order to secure their\npossession over the land in exercise of their right to private defence but\nthe learned trial Court has completely ignored this aspect. The\nappellants / accused cannot be convicted for commission of offence of\nculpable homicide as the prosecution has failed to establish that the\nappellants had any intention or knowledge to cause death of Koushal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                      5</span>\n\n\n\n\nPrasad and hardly they can be convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1133601/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 325</a> of IPC. It is\nfurther submitted that the appeal filed on behalf of the State against\nthe judgment of acquittal is without any merits. Learned trial court has\nvery seriously and deeply appreciated the evidence coming to the\nconclusion of the acquittal of the acquitted accused persons namely\nBhuvneshwar, Ramesh, Bhimsen, Lalmani and Ramkhelawan and there\nis no ground to convict them for the offence for which they have been\nacquitted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">8.           Learned GA appearing for the respondent / State has\nargued in support of the impugned judgment and stated that the\nfinding of conviction and sentence of the learned trial court is in\naccordance with law. Hence, the appeal filed by the appellants /\naccused be dismissed and the appeal filed by State be allowed as the\ntrial Court has committed grave error in acquitting the appellants /\naccused from the charges for which they were tried and all the\nacquitted accused persons be convicted and sentenced for the offence\nfor which they were charged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">9.           Having considered the contentions of learned counsel for\nthe parties and on perusal of the record, it is found that in the incident\nKoushal Prasad died on account of the injuries and Rambahore (PW-1),\nAnsuiya Prasad (PW-2), Ganga Prasad (PW-3) and Vidyawati (PW-5) also\nsustained injuries. In this regard, Dr. B. K. Garg (PW-7) has stated that on\n5.7.1996 he being an Assistant Surgeon in Civil Dispensary, Baikuntpur\nexamined the aforesaid persons and found following injuries on their\nperson :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">Rambahore Sharma (PW-1)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">             1.

Dr. Pramod Shrivastava (PW-11) has stated that on 11.7.1996\nat Medical College, Jabalpur he examined dead body of Koushal Prasad\nnear about 12 O&#x27;clock and found following injuries :-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">            1.     Partially healed stitched wound present over\n                   scalp on middle part of left parietal region\n                   placed anti-posteriorly ½&quot; label to sagital\n                   interior. Scalp is contused on right frontal\n                   parietal occipital region and temporal region on\n                   both side. Stitched wound is 3x1/2&quot; long.

Liquefaction of brain started in\n                  this area.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">            2.    Fracture of left radius bone of fore arm in lower\n                  one third muscularly ward.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">            3.

Cause of death is\ncronio cerebral injuries. All the injuries were anti-mortem in nature and\ncould be produced by hard and blunt object and was sufficient to cause\ndeath.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">11.         The wife of the deceased, Vidyawati (PW-5) and\nRambahore (PW-1), Ansuiya Prasad (PW-2) and Ganga Prasad (PW-3)\nhave stated that on account of the injuries sustained in the incident\ntook place on 5.7.1996 on their field Koushal Prasad died. The aforesaid\nprosecution witnesses have remained unimpeachable and there is no\nhesitation to hold that death of Koushal Prasad was homicidal and he\ndied on account of the injuries sustained to him on 5.7.1996.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">12.         Now the question is that whether all the accused persons\nconstituted an unlawful assembly with common object to cause death\nof the deceased and in furtherance of their common object, all or some\nmembers of the assembly caused death of the deceased and also\ncaused injuries to Rambahore (PW-1) Ansuiya (PW-2), Ganga Prasad\n(PW-3) and Vidyawati (PW-5).\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                     8</span>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">13.         Having considered minutely the statements of Ramkishore\n(PW-4) and Kalari Kol (PW-6) it is found that they are not trustworthy\nwitnesses. Learned trial court has also discarded their statements\nbecause Kalari Kol (PW-6) has stated that all the accused persons came\ntogether and started beating to Koushal Prasad. Same statement has\nbeen given by Ramkishore (PW-4) which is contrary to the prosecution\nstory and Kalari Kol (PW-6) has also stated that he was suffering from\nblindness and he was not able to identify anybody. Similarly,\nRamkishore (PW-4) is not natural witness and on the spot his presence\nis doubtful. He resides 3 kms. away from the place of incident. He has\nstated that with a view to getting shaved he was standing in front of\nthe barber shop near the spot but this fact is missing in his police\nstatement Ex.D/7. Thus, their testimonies are not creditable. Similarly\nstatement Ex.D/3    Dying declaration of Koushal Prasad is also not\ntrustworthy. It is a statement recorded under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 161</a> of Cr.P.C. by\nInvestigating Officer T. S. Gautam (PW-10) in the hospital on 5.7.1996.\nBut, Dr. B. K. Garg (PW-7) denied the fact that the same was recorded\nbefore his presence and on the statement, a note about fitness of\nKoushal Prasad was made under the pressure of Investigating officer.\nTherefore, the trial court has discarded this statement and this\nconsidered view of the trial court does not require any interference.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">14.         So far as the statement of other eye witnesses are\nconcerned, they have never stated that all the accused persons came\ntogether on the spot and started beating deceased Koushal.\nRambahore (PW-1), Ansuiya Prasad (PW-2) and Ganga Prasad (PW3)\nhave categorically stated that while the deceased was going for taking\nseed, accused Bindawasi, Suresh Patel armed with lathi and Dinesh\narmed with farsa restrained Koushal and started abusing him and\naccused Bindawasi assaulted Koushal with lathi on his head then\naccused Suresh assaulted Koushal with lathi then accused Dinesh\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                    9</span>\n\n\n\n\nassaulted Koushal with farsa on his head and thereafter other accused\npersons Bhuvneshwar Prasad, Ramesh Prasad and Bhimsen came and\nwhen Rambahore (PW-1), Ansuiya Prasad (PW-2), Ganga Prasad (PW-3)\ntried to save the deceased, accused Dinesh assaulted Rambahore (PW-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">1) on his head and accused Bhimsen assaulted with lathi on his head and\nmeanwhile accused Ramadhar, Ramkhelawan and Lalmani also came\nand started abusing them. Vidyawati wife of the deceased also came\nover there and lay on Koushal Prasad to save him then accused\nBindawasi also beaten her with lathi. On making hue and cry, people\ngathered there and accused person fled away. Thereafter, Rambahore\n(PW-1), Koushal Prasdad, Ansuiya Prasad (PW-2) and Ganga Prasad (PW-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">3) went to the Police station where Rambahore (PW-1) lodged report\nEx.P/1 and Koushal Prasad was sent to Rewa District Hospital, where he\ndied. Vidyawati (PW-5) however has stated that all the accused persons\nassaulted his husband but it is clear that she reached on the spot later-\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">on and after reaching her on the spot, nobody assaulted her husband.\nHowever, she was assaulted by accused Bindawasi, FIR Ex.P/1 has been\nlodged by Rambahore (PW-1) which also reflects that except accused\nSuresh, Bindawasi and Dinesh, other accused persons reached on the\nspot after falling down Koushal Prasad on account of the injuries caused\nby Suresh, Bindawasi and Dinesh. This fact categorically establishes that\naccused Suresh, Bindawasi and Dinesh at the time of assaulting the\ndeceased were not member of unlawful assembly with other accused\npersons and they did not act in furtherance of common object of\nunlawful assembly. In the circumstances it is clear that accused Suresh,\nBindawasi and Dinesh are responsible for causing death of the\ndeceased they came there and assaulted simultaneously and caused\ninjuries to the deceased which led to his death. As per opinion of the\nmedical expert Dr. Pramod Shrivastava (PW-11), cause of death was\nhead injury of the deceased which was sufficient to cause his death.\nHowever, he has not stated that the injury was sufficient to cause death\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                    10</span>\n\n\n\n\nin ordinary course of nature and the death had taken place after 5 to 6\ndays of the incident. He has also stated that the injury was caused by\nhard and blunt object.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">15.         In view of the circumstances, learned defense counsel has\nstated that opinion of the medical expert is contrary to the statements\nof eye witnesses as all the eye witnesses have stated that the head\ninjury was caused by sharp object farsa. Hence, medical evidence and\nocular evidence is contradictory to each other. In such circumstances,\nthe prosecution version cannot be accepted to be correct beyond\nreasonable doubt. But the aforesaid opinion has no significance as Dr.\nPramod Shrivastava (PW-11) has examined dead body after 5-6 days of\nthe incident during which injuries were stitched and were not in the\ncondition to easily find out whether the injuries were caused by blunt\nobject or sharp object. Hence, it cannot be said that there are material\ncontradictions between the medical evidence and ocular evidence. The\ntestimony of the eye witnesses with regard to causing injuries to\nKoushal Prasad by accused Suresh, Bindawasi and Dinesh is trustworthy\nand beyond reasonable doubt it establishes that they were author of\nthe death of Koushal Prasad.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">16.        Now, the question arises whether appellants Suresh,\nBindawasi and Dinesh have committed murder of the deceased or\nculpable homicide. From the record it appears that the deceased and\nthe accused persons are residents of the same village and close relative\nand there was a land dispute between them and the alleged incident\ntook place when deceased Koushal Prasad and his companion tried to\ncultivate Raur field and the appellants assaulted the deceased and only\none injury was fatal. There is no specific opinion of the medical expert\nthat the injury was sufficient to cause death in ordinary course of nature\nand no instant death had taken place. The deceased survived 5 to 6\ndays after the incident. Hence, it cannot be said with all certainty that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                     11</span>\n\n\n\n\naccused Suresh, Bindawasi and Dinesh assaulted the deceased with a\nview to commit his murder. However, with all certainty it can be said\nthat they all acted knowingly that by their act death may be caused and\nthe head injury led to death caused by Dinesh; and accused Suresh and\nBindawasi had common intention with him as they all came together\nwith weapons and also assaulted him. Hence, all the aforesaid three\naccused persons may be held guilty for committing culpable homicide\nof deceased Koushal Prasad sharing common intention of them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">17.         The defence taken by the accused persons about exercising\nright of private defence of their property does not appear to be\nplausible as there is no evidence that the appellants were in exclusive\npossession of the land on which the incident was taken place. In this\nregard, Rajeshwar Prasad Patel (DW-2) has stated that the accused\npersons were in possession of Survey No. 611 where the incident was\ntaken place on Survey no.612. Hence, his testimony is meaningless with\nregard to possession over the disputed land. Therefore, the defence is\nnot found to be proved and the learned trial Court has rightly ignored it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">18.         As discussed earlier, so far as other accused persons\nRamesh and Lalmani are concerned, they reached on the spot after\nfalling of deceased Koushal Prasad on account of sustaining head injury,\ntherefore, they cannot be held guilty for forming unlawful assembly\nhaving common object for causing death of Koushal Prasad. Apart from\nit, the evidence about accused Ramesh and Lalmani with regard to\ntaking part in the incident even later part is also not trustworthy. Their\nname has not been mentioned in the FIR Ex.P/1. Therefore, learned trial\nCourt has not committed any error in holding that the prosecution has\nfailed to prove their participation in the incident. So far as other\naccused persons Ramadhar, Bhimsen, Bhuvneshwar and Ramkhelawan\nare concerned, they reached on the spot separately without having\ncommon object or common intention, therefore, they can be held guilty\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                    12</span>\n\n\n\n\nfor their own individual act. Learned trial court has given benefit of\ndoubt to accused Ramkhelawan as none of the witnesses have\nspecifically mentioned that he caused injury to any member of the\ncomplainant party. We also do not find any cogent reason to interfere\nin the aforesaid finding.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">19.          On careful reading of testimony of Rambahore (PW-1),\nAnsuiya Prasad (PW-2), Ganga Prasad (PW-3) and Vidyawati (PW-5) it is\nestablished that accused Dinesh also caused simply injury with farsa on\nthe head of Rambahore (PW-1) and co-accused Bhimsen and\nBhuvneshwar also caused simple injury with lathi to Rambahore (PW-1)\nand Ramadhar caused simple injury with lathi to Ansuiya (PW-2) and\naccused Suresh and Bindawasi also willfully caused injury with lathi to\nVidyawati (PW-5).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">20.          In view of the aforesaid discussions, appellants Suresh,\nBindawasi and Dinesh are held guilty for offence punishable under\n<a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 304</a> Part-II of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_31\">IPC</a> for committing culpable homicide of\nKoushal Prasad and appellants Suresh and Bindawasi are also held guilty\nfor commission of offence under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 323</a> of the IPC. Against\nappellant / accused Dinesh there is no appeal with regard to acquittal of\nhim from the offence punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 323</a> of the IPC.\nTherefore, he cannot be held guilty for the offence punishable under\n<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 323</a> of the IPC with regard to causing simple injury to\nRambahore (PW-1). Hence, conviction and sentence recorded by the\ntrial court with regard to the aforesaid appellants / accused persons are\nmodified and convicted accordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_27\">21.         So far as the sentence is concerned, appellant Dinesh is in\ncustody since 31.10.2007 till today but he might have been released\nafter completion of sentence period of 10 years, therefore, he is\nsentenced to the period already undergone by him in jail. If appellant\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                     13</span>\n\n\n\n\nDinesh is in jail he be released forthwith if not required to be detained in\nany other case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">22.         So far as appellants Suresh and Bindawasi are concerned,\nfrom the records it appears that during trial appellant Suresh was in jail\nfrom 8.7.1996 up to 20.4.2000 and from 20.4.2000 up to 4.1.2001 and\nthus, he has undergone 4 years 5 months and 27 days in jail and\nappellant Bindawasi was in jail from 13.8.1996 up to 20.4.2000 and from\n20.4.2000 up to 4.1.2001 and thus, he has undergone 4 years 4 months\nand 21 days in jail. At the time of commission of offence, appellant /\naccused Suresh was near about 21 years old and at present appellant /\naccused Bindawasi is 70 years old and the case is also completed more\nthan 20 years. They were armed with lathi and have not caused fatal\ninjury. In the circumstances, it may be appropriate to take a lenient view\nin comparison to the main accused Dinesh. In this regard, learned\ncounsel for the appellants / accused has also submitted that Hon&#x27;ble the\nApex Court in the case of State of Punjab and Mann Singh and another\nAIR 1983 SC 172 considering the facts and circumstances of the case\nunder <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 304</a> Part-2 of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_36\">IPC</a> reduced the sentence to undergo RI\nfor 3 years with a fine of Rs.3000/-. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"325890\" id=\"span_13\">In the case of Suresh Singh and\nanother vs. State of Haryana AIT 2007 SC 3093 Hon&#x27;ble the Apex Court\nreduced the sentence under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 304</a> Part-2 of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_38\">IPC</a> to 5 years RI.\nIn the case of <a href=\"/doc/325890/\" id=\"a_39\">Bhagwati Prasad vs. State of Madhya Pradesh</a> (2010) 1\nSCC 697 Hon&#x27;ble the Apex court has considered the sentence of 5 years\nRI to be appropriate under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 304</a> Part-2 of the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_41\">IPC</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_29\">23.         In view of the aforesaid judgments of Hon&#x27;ble the Apex\nCourt and also considering the circumstances of the present case, in\nview of this court, the aforesaid period of the custody already\nundergone by appellants Suresh and Bindawasi would be just and\nproper to achieve the ends of justice. Hence, appellants Suresh and\nBindawasi are sentenced to the period already undergone by them in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                          14</span>\n\n\n\n\njail as mentioned earlier with the fine of Rs.5000/- each, in default of\npayment of fine, further 6 months RI. Appellants Suresh and Bindawasi\nare on bail. Their bail bonds stand discharged.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">24.          So far as other accused Persons Bhimsen and Bhuvneshwar\nare concerned, they have been found guilty for causing willfully simple\ninjury to Rambahore (PW-1) and learned trial court has convicted them\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 323</a> of the IPC and sentenced to undergo RI for 6 months\nbut they have not filed any appeal and they have already undergone the\naforesaid sentence during trial. Therefore, no further order is required\nto be passed in this regard.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">25.          So far as accused Ramadhar is concerned, he is convicted\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 323</a> of the IPC for causing simple injury to Ansuiya Prasad\n(PW-2) with lathi. So far as the sentence is concerned, during trial he has\nremained in custody from 18.10.1996 up to 21.1.1997 and after judgment\nfrom 20.4.2000 up to 29.5.2000, therefore, he is sentenced to the\nperiod already undergone by him in jail as no purpose will be served by\nagain sending him in jail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_32\">26.
