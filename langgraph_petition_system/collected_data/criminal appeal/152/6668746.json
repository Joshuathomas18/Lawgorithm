Paramount consideration of the Court is always to\n\navoid miscarriage of justice. A miscarriage of justice which may arise\n\nfrom the conviction of an         innocent       is no       less than from             the\n\nacquittal of guilty.      In this case,        the totality of      the    facts        and\n\ncircumstances of the case point towards the fact                      that the trial\n\nCourt has taken a view based upon conjectures and hypothesis and\n\nnot on the legal evidence         while acquitting the          accused-respondent\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 306</a> of the Code is concerned.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">            <a href=\"/doc/92983/\" id=\"a_8\">Section     306</a> of the Code, which reads as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                          &quot;       306.

The complainant gave beatings to\n\nDarshan kaur.          This witness further stated that Darshan kaur                    had\n\nbeen taken to Khamanon            hospital by         Jagga Singh and             and    at\n\nthat    time she was not         in her senses and was unconscious.

For\n\ndiscarding       the prosecution version,               the       trial Judge      mainly\n\ndisbelieved the presence of Kuldeep Singh (P.W.9) son of                         Darshan\n\nKaura     and the complainant at the house.                   Kuldeep Singh (P.W.9)\n\nwas a student of 9th Class.
