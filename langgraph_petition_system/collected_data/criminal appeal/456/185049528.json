All these appeals are being disposed of by this common\n\njudgment as they arise out of the same judgment and order, which\n\nhave been assailed in all these appeals, they constituting the common\n\ncause for these appellants to feel aggrieved in this case.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">2.            The judgment and order under challenge have been\n\nrendered in Special Criminal MCOC No.7/2013 on 23/05/2016 by the\n\nSpecial Judge designated under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_1\">MCOC Act</a> and Additional Sessions\n\nJudge-5, Nagpur.              By this judgment and order, the appellants\n\nnumbering five in total have been found guilty of the offences\n\npunishable under Sections 302, 143, 147 and 148 read with <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_2\">Section\n\n149</a> of the Indian Penal Code (&#x27;<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_3\">IPC</a>&#x27; for short) and innocent of the\n\noffences punishable under Sections 3(1)(i) and 3(4) of the\n\nMaharashtra Control of Organized Crime Act (&#x27;<a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_4\">MCOC Act</a>&#x27; for short)\n\nand also under <a href=\"/doc/1555874/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 4</a> and <a href=\"/doc/73862/\" id=\"a_6\">25</a> of the Arms Act. For their such guilt,\n\nthe Special Judge has awarded to these appellants, such punishments\n\nas imprisonment for life and fine of Rs.2,000/- with default sentence of\n\none year for an offence punishable under Section 302 read with\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">     ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                          ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                     4</span>\n\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 149</a> of IPC for each of the appellants, rigorous imprisonment\n\nfor three months and fine of Rs.500/- with default sentence of one\n\nmonth for an offence under Section 143 for each of the appellants,\n\nrigorous imprisonment of six months and fine of Rs.750/- with default\n\nsentence of two months for an offence under Section 147 for each of\n\nthe appellants and rigorous imprisonment for one year and fine of\n\nRs.1000/- with default sentence of three months for an offence under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/763672/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 148</a> of IPC for each of the appellants. There was one more\n\naccused, who was tried for all these offences along with the appellants,\n\noriginal accused No.4 - Narendra @ Naru Nandurkar, but he has been\n\nacquitted of all the offences with which he was charged in this case.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.            For the sake of convenience, we would now refer to these\n\nappellants by their nomenclature as accused and the order in which\n\nthey were arrayed as accused in the charge-sheet. Appellant - Rohit\n\nRamteke in Criminal Appeal No.432/2016 was the original accused\n\nNo.1, appellant - Ketan Shambharkar in Criminal Appeal No.223/2016\n\nwas the original accused No.2, appellant Nos.1 &amp; 2 Saurabh Adlak and\n\nSumit @ Sandy Bhasme in Criminal Appeal No.228/2016 respectively\n\nwere original accused Nos.3 &amp; 6 and Appellant - Chandrashekhar @\n\nChandrya in Criminal Appeal No.238/2017 was original accused No.5.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">     ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019               ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                       5</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.            It so happened that all the accused persons operating an\n\norganized crime syndicate in the vicinity of NDR Square Area, Banerjee\n\nLayout, Nagpur had cast their evil eye upon the house of one Shalu\n\nGote, which was situated in the area of operation of the accused with a\n\nview to illegally grab the same.          Accused No.1, in particular, had\n\npressurized, on some occasions, Shalu Gote either to transfer her\n\nhouse in his name or pay him an amount of Rs.1,00,000/-, but Shalu\n\nGote stubbornly refused to succumb to the pressure. Peeved over the\n\nobstinacy of Shalu Gote, the accused caused damage to her house and\n\nthe incident was reported to Ajni Police Station in which deceased\n\nSantosh Sare, son-in-law of Shalu Gote, had taken a lead role. Since\n\nthen, it appears that accused No.1 and all his associates in this crime\n\nhad nurtured a grudge against the deceased.                  They found an\n\nopportunity to settle the score with the deceased in the night of\n\n19/06/2013.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.            Incident, according to the charge framed against the accused\n\npersons, took place on 19.06.2013 at about 09:45 p.m. near NDR\n\nSquare, Banerjee Layout, Nagpur. At that time, the deceased riding a\n\nmotorcycle with his friend Saurabh Humne occupying pillion seat\n\ncame to pass through the NDR Square. All the accused not wanting to\n\nsquander the opportunity, obstructed the way of the motorcycle. The\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">     ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                   ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                            6</span>\n\n\n\n\nrider and the pillion rider both along with the motorcycle fell down on\n\nthe road. Immediately thereafter, it is alleged, accused No.1 Rohit\n\nMeshram lifted, the deceased and then he started giving fist and kick\n\nblows to the deceased.              Accused No.2 Ketan Shambharkar accused\n\nNo.3 Saurabh and accused No.6 Sumit @ Sandy not to be left behind\n\nalso joined hands with accused No.1 in the assault and they too gave\n\nfist and kick blows to the deceased. At the same time, the other person\n\nriding pillion seat of the motorcycle, Saurabh Humne, was taken over\n\nby accused No.5 Chandrashekhar @ Chandrya and was dragged by\n\naccused No.5 to a place situated near a garage which was stated to be\n\nlocated in front of an Ice Cream Parlor. Accused No.5 gave 2-3 slaps to\n\nSaurabh Humne and then handing him over to                        accused No.4\n\nNarendra @ Naru Nandurkar, returned to the spot where the\n\nremaining accused were busy assaulting the deceased by means of fist\n\nand kicks blows.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">6.            Reaching the spot where the deceased had been made to\n\nsuffer the merciless shower of kicks and fist blows upon him, accused\n\nNo.5 whipped out a knife and gave its multiple blows to the deceased.\n\nAccused Nos.1, 2, 3 &amp; 6 also followed suit and gave multiple blows of\n\nthe knives on the chest, abdomen and other parts of the body of the\n\ndeceased. Deceased dropped to the ground in a pool of blood. The\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">     ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                     ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                       7</span>\n\n\n\n\nassault, it is further alleged, did not stop there and all these accused\n\npersons lifted a cement block or a tile which was actually a lid of a\n\nsewage tank and hit it on the face of the deceased twice thereby\n\ncrushing the face of the deceased.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">7.            Watching in horror the brutality displayed by accused Nos.1,\n\n2, 3, 5 &amp; 6, the other person Saurabh Humne, who was held by\n\naccused No.4 Naru Nandurkar, made an attempt at fleeing away from\n\nthe spot by jerking off his hands from the clutches of accused No.4 and\n\nwas successful in that attempt. Accused No.1 seeing the other person\n\nrun away shouted to stop him saying that he should not be left and be\n\nkilled. Accused No.4 then tried to chase Saurabh Humne but the effort\n\nwas futile.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">8.            The incident, it is alleged, was watched by several persons\n\nbut nobody came forward to speak anything about the incident as\n\naccused No.1 while running away from the spot of incident along with\n\nhis associates on two motorcycles, had brandished the knife and had\n\nthreatened the onlookers of dire consequences if any of them had the\n\ncourage to speak a word against the accused persons.                  However,\n\nsomebody had by that time already informed the Police Station Ajni\n\nand the police immediately swung into action. The police reached the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">     ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                  ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                    8</span>\n\n\n\n\nspot of incident and saw the aftermath of the ghastly incident. The\n\ncement block or tile covering the face of the deceased was removed.\n\nSpot-panchnama was drawn. Articles lying at the spot and which were\n\nrelevant for investigation were seized. Local inquiry was made but,\n\nnobody said anything against the accused.        The crime for various\n\noffences was registered against unknown accused.          Dead body was\n\nsent to the Medical College and Hospital for conduct of postmortem\n\nexamination. On the basis of secret information, accused Nos.1 to 5\n\nwere arrested on 29/06/2013, while accused No.6 was arrested later\n\non. Discoveries were made and incriminating articles including the\n\nknives were recovered at the instance of the accused persons. The\n\npostmortem report was obtained. Necessary seizures were made. As it\n\nwas found during the course of investigation that the accused persons\n\nwere members of a crime syndicate and had committed this crime in\n\nan organized manner, sanction for invoking the provision of <a href=\"/doc/174706891/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 3</a>\n\nof MCOC Act in the crime was obtained from the competent authority\n\nand the further investigation was carried on by an Officer of the rank\n\nof Assistant Commissioner of Police. After completion of the\n\ninvestigation, a charge-sheet was filed against all the accused persons\n\nand they were tried for the offences to which a specific reference has\n\nalready been made earlier. The learned Special Judge acquitted\n\naccused No.4 of all the offences for which he was tried in this case, but\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">   ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                  ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                        9</span>\n\n\n\n\nconvicted the present appellants, who are accused Nos.1, 2, 3, 5 &amp; 6\n\nvide above-stated offences and in the manner stated earlier and\n\nacquitted all these accused persons of the offences under the\n\nprovisions of the <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_10\">MCOC Act and Arms Act</a>, as stated earlier, by the\n\nimpugned judgment and order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">9.

It is not in dispute that in this case, the whole prosecution\n\ncase is based upon the evidence of two key witnesses who were the eye\n\nwitnesses namely, the PW-1 Akshay, and the PW-5 Mangesh, with\n\nsome circumstantial evidence to give a boost to the prosecution case.\n\nProsecution witness No.2, Santosh Humane, the pillion rider of the\n\nmotorcycle rode by deceased Santosh, turned hostile and rendered no\n\nassistance to the prosecution as well as the court in finding the truth.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                  ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                      10</span>\n\n\n\n\nSimilarly, the clothes seized in this case have not revealed any blood\n\nstains of human origin.

According to Shri Tiwari, learned\n\ncounsel for accused No.2, PW-5 admitted that he had read the police\n\nstatement before entering the witness box, which has created a doubt\n\nabout his credibility.               He has also pointed out that both the eye-\n\nwitnesses were under the influence of police as admittedly, they were\n\nassisted by police constables before their depositions, and the police\n\nconstables were also present in the Court hall at the time of the\n\ndeposition of PW 1.              Shri Daga, learned counsel for accused No.3\n\nadditionally has pointed out the discrepancy between the evidence of\n\nPW-1 and PW-5 in so far as the role attributed to accused no.3 is\n\nconcerned. Shri Ali, learned counsel for accused No.5 pointing out\n\nfrom the evidence of defence witness No.1 submits that according to\n\nthe defence witness, the person who ran the ice parlor and from where\n\nthe eye witnesses have allegedly seen the incident, has stated in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                        ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                      13</span>\n\n\n\n\ncategorical terms that from the ice cream parlor, the spot was not\n\nvisible. Shri Jaltare, learned counsel for accused No.6, in his effort to\n\npoint out some additional factors has submitted that there were\n\nmaterial omissions in the evidence of the key witnesses which create\n\ndoubt about the role attributed to accused No.6.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_28\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">16.            Shri Doifode, learned A.P.P. for the State, however, has\n\nexpressed his complete disagreement with the argument so advanced\n\non behalf of the appellants. He submits that when the ocular evidence\n\nis found to be trustworthy and this case being one such case, such\n\nevidence would require no corroboration.         He submits that while\n\naccused Nos.1 to 5 were arrested on 29/06/2013, the accused No.6\n\nwas at large for some days more and was arrested on 06/07/2013 and\n\nso, it is only after this date that the fear of accused started subsiding.\n\nThe statements of the two key prosecution witnesses were recorded on\n\n12/07/2013 hardly after a delay of about six days, which he further\n\nsubmits, has been satisfactorily explained not only by the witnesses\n\nthemselves but also the facts and circumstances of the case. He says\n\nthat the terror of all the accused persons was so great that it prevented\n\nthe eye-witnesses from coming forward to give any information to the\n\npolice regarding the murder committed by the accused persons. He\n\nsubmits that the fear of these witnesses began immediately after the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019               ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                       14</span>\n\n\n\n\nincident when accused no.1 threatened them with dire consequences,\n\nif they revealed anything against them or about the incident to\n\nanybody including the police.        In addition to that he submits, the\n\nmother of PW-1 and sister of PW-5 had also advised PW-1 and PW-5 to\n\nnot speak anything against the accused and about the incident. He\n\nsubmits that this only added to the apprehension entertained by these\n\nwitnesses about their own safety and, therefore, in spite of intermittent\n\nvisits of the police to their residence, these witnesses chose to remain\n\nsilent. He also submits that this fear of the witnesses disappeared only\n\nwhen the last of the six accused persons was arrested and it was after\n\n06/07/2013. He also submits that even the Investigating Officer has\n\ngiven an explanation and he has not been cross-examined on this\n\naspect of the matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">17.

He further\n\nsubmits that there are also no material contradictions in their\n\nrespective testimonies rather their testimonies support each other. He\n\nfurther submits that the circumstantial evidence also corroborates the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                 ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                        15</span>\n\n\n\n\nocular evidence, here.

He further submits that none of\n\nthe accused persons has given any explanation in this regard.                    He\n\nfurther submits that even otherwise, if the ocular evidence is\n\ntrustworthy, corroboration from the circumstantial evidence is not\n\nrequired and in this case, the evidence of the eyewitnesses is\n\ncompletely reliable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">18.            Shri Doifode further submits that there is also evidence\n\nabout motive of the accused persons which can be gathered from the\n\nprevious incident which took place on 28/09/2012 in respect of which\n\noffences were registered against the accused regarding their damaging\n\nthe house of one Shalu Gote, whose son-in-law was the deceased and\n\nthe accused then using obscene words against Shalu Gote, also issued\n\na threat to bring under control her son-in-law deceased Santosh.

In fact, the evidence brought on record by the\n\nprosecution puts a stamp of confirmation on such nature of death of\n\nSantosh Sare in the night of 19.6.2013.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_37\">20.               The incident is alleged to have taken place at                  NDR\n\nSquare, Banerjee Layout at about 9.45 pm of 19.6.2013. According to\n\nthe prosecution, at that time, deceased Santosh Sare was riding a\n\nmotor-cycle with PW 2 Saurav occupying its pillion seat.                            The\n\nprosecution story is that just prior to 9.45 pm, the deceased along with\n\nPW 2 Saurav happened to pass through NDR Square on the motor-\n\ncycle when the accused persons led by accused no. 1 obstructed the\n\nway of motor-cycle and caused it fall down and thereafter they\n\nlaunched brutal assault not only by means of fist and kick blows, but\n\nalso knives and finally cement-concrete tile on the person of Santosh\n\nSare, while they also spirited away PW 2 Saurav to a spot some\n\ndistance away from the spot of incident and subjected him to beating\n\nby kicks and fist blows.             This prosecution story for its truthfulness\n\nwould have to be verified by appreciating the evidence of the eye\n\nwitnesses and other supporting evidence, if any. But, the fact remains\n\nthat deceased Santosh was subjected to severe assault at the spot of\n\nincident at about 9.45 pm of 19.6.2013. This is evident from the spot\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                       ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                      17</span>\n\n\n\n\npanchanama (exhibit 97), inquest panchanama (exhibit 82) and the\n\nevidence of PW 8 Dr Jaydeo Borkar, the Medical Officer who\n\nconducted post-mortem examination on the dead body of Santosh Sare\n\nin between 2.30 pm and 4.30 pm on 26.6.2013 which is supported by\n\nthe post-mortem report vide exhibit 83.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">21.               The spot panchanama and inquest panchanama do show\n\nthat deceased Santosh Sare was lying in supine condition at the spot of\n\nincident with his face being covered completely by a cement concrete\n\ntile. This cement-concrete tile had crushed the face of Santosh Sare\n\nand made it beyond visible recognition. These documents also show\n\nthat several injuries including stab injuries were inflicted to Santosh\n\nSare that made deceased Santosh lay at the spot of incident lifeless in a\n\npool of blood. PW 8 Dr Jaydeo Borkar in his post-mortem examination\n\nhad noticed in all 23 external injuries of varying nature from lacerated\n\ninjuries, stab injuries to abrasive injuries. On internal examination,\n\nPW 8 Dr Jaydeo Borkar has also found corresponding injuries present\n\non such internal organs as scalp, skull, brain, thorax, left lung,\n\nabdomen, stomach, small intestine, large intestine and kidneys. These\n\ninjuries, in his opinion, were ante-mortem and made PW 8 Dr Jaydeo\n\nBorkar further opine that death of Santosh Sare was due to shock and\n\nhaemorrhage produced by the injuries seen and noted by him in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019               ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                        18</span>\n\n\n\n\npost-mortem report.

The evidence discussed above would make us feel\n\nconvinced that there is not an iota of doubt to conclude that Santosh\n\nSare was intentionally handed out a premature death brought out in a\n\nbrutal and extremely painful manner by brutal human beings not one\n\nbut mostly many as the nature of assault suggests.

According to the prosecution, these appellants who are\n\naccused nos. 1, 2, 3, 5 and 6 are responsible for causing such homicidal\n\ndeath of Santosh and in order to prove its case against these accused\n\npersons, the prosecution relies upon the evidence of PW 1 Akshay\n\nUike, PW 5 Mangesh Tichkule and also Chemical Analyzer&#x27;s Reports.\n\nLet us first examine the ocular evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">24.               PW 1 Akshay Uike is a painter by profession. According to\n\nhim, at about 8-8.15 pm on 19.6.2013, he along with his friend PW 5\n\nMangesh came to NDR Square and stood in a lane beside NDR Square.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                  ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                         19</span>\n\n\n\n\nHe says that after some time, he heard a noise which would emanate\n\non a motor-cycle taking to the ground. He further says that he and his\n\nfriend saw two persons falling down along with the motor-cycle and\n\nthen both of them saw accused nos. 1 to 6 as launching an assault,\n\nfirstly upon the rider of the motor-cycle and then on the pillion rider of\n\nthe motor-cycle.           He has narrated the sequence of events as they\n\nunfolded one after another culminating into stabbing of the rider of the\n\nmotor-cycle with knives by accused no. 5, accused no. 1 and accused\n\nno. 3 with the finale of smashing of face of the rider of the motor-cycle\n\nby a cement-concrete tile by accused no.1, accused no. 2, accused no. 3\n\nand accused no. 6. He further says that he and his friend saw the\n\nincident from the ice-cream parlour and the distance between the spot\n\nof incident and the ice-cream parlour was of about 70-80 feet.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_46\">25.               PW 1 Akshay has further stated that after the assault was\n\nover, all the accused went away from the spot of incident riding two\n\nmotor-cycles, with each motor-cycle occupied by three accused\n\npersons. He also says that while leaving the spot of incident, accused\n\nno. 1 threatened all the on-lookers who had gathered at the spot of\n\nincident with dire consequences if they disclosed the incident to police.\n\nHe then states that he and his friend were frightened and both of them\n\nwent back home. He further says that on reaching home, he narrated\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                  ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                        20</span>\n\n\n\n\nthe incident to his mother who advised him not to disclose the incident\n\nto anybody and that he should forget the incident. He assigns the\n\nreason for such advice. He says that the advice was so given by his\n\nmother because of the terror of the accused persons in his locality. He\n\nalso states that as the accused persons were not arrested, he carried a\n\nfear in his mind to speak anything about the incident before the police.\n\nHe maintained that after arrest of the accused persons, he along with\n\nhis friend went to the Police Station to narrate the incident on their\n\nown which was about 2/3 weeks of the incident and then police\n\nrecorded his statement as per his say.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">26.               PW 5 Mangesh Tichkule, a driver by profession and friend\n\nof PW 1 Akshay Uike, has also narrated the incident in a manner\n\nhaving similarity on many aspects of the incident as disclosed by PW 1\n\nAkshay Uike and dissimilarity on some of the aspects spoken about by\n\nPW 1 Akshay which are also significant. As far as the assault on the\n\nperson of Santosh Sare by means of kick and fist blows, knives and\n\ncement-concrete tile is concerned, his version substantially matches\n\nwith that of PW 1 Akshay.            However, there are some significant\n\ndeviations in his narration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">27.

PW 5 Mangesh says that he along\n\nwith his friend Akshay had been to ice-cream parlour at about 8.00 pm\n\nto 8.30 pm at NDR square. He states that both of them were standing\n\nin the lane of ice-cream parlour from where, according to him, the\n\nincident was witnessed by him and his friend PW 1 Akshay. So, there is\n\na variation between these two versions as to from where they saw the\n\nincident from the ice-cream parlour or the lane of the ice-cream\n\nparlour ? There is no other evidence brought on record, which would\n\nclear this discrepancy.              The defence witness (DW 1) adds another\n\ndimension. He says that the spot is not visible from the railing of the\n\nice-cream parlour and there is nothing in his entire evidence to say that\n\nthis statement is untrustworthy. So, the doubts continue - from which\n\nplace the incident was seen or was it really seen ? And, these doubts\n\nstay all throughout.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_52\">28.               The variation goes on further.

PW\n\n1 Akshay says that accused no. 5 Chandrya subjected the second\n\nperson to beating by means of stick and kicks near the garage,\n\nascribing no role to accused no. 4 Naru in this beating. PW 1 Akshay\n\nsays that after beating the second person, accused no. 5 left him in the\n\ncustody of accused no. 4 Naru while accused no. 5 walked over to a\n\nplace where accused no. 1 Rohit was busy beating the first person\n\n(rider of the motor-cycle). PW 5 Mangesh says that this second person\n\nwas subjected to beating near the garage by both the accused no. 4\n\nNaru and accused no. 5 Chandrya. These are further discrepancies,\n\nwhich, in our opinion, are significant, given the fact they were\n\nsomething which were noticeable without mistake even by a person\n\nnot keenly watching the incident.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">29.

PW 1 Akshay also says that accused no. 2 Ketan drew forth a\n\nknife and gave its blows to motor-cycle rider. He further says that\n\naccused no. 1 Rohit, accused no. 2 Ketan, accused no. 3 Saurabh and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                 ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                         23</span>\n\n\n\n\naccused no. 6 Sandy all lifted the cement-concrete tile which was kept\n\nas a lid over a nearby sewage tank and banged it on the face of the\n\ndeceased.     However, PW 5 Mangesh has given a sightly different\n\nversion. He agrees that the first blow of knife was given by accused\n\nno. 5 Chandrya. He also agrees that accused no. 1 Rohit took the knife\n\nfrom the hands of accused no. 5 and gave it&#x27;s 2-3 blows on the\n\nabdomen and chest of Santosh Sare. But, he also adds that accused\n\nno. 3 Saurabh took the same knife from the hands of accused no. 1\n\nRohit and used it for dealing its blows to the deceased, a fact not\n\nstated by PW 1 Akshay. He further says that accused no. 2 Ketan gave\n\nknife blows using his own knife, but again he ascribes additional role\n\nto accused no. 6 stating that using his own knife, accused no. 6 gave its\n\nblows to the deceased.            So, PW 5 Mangesh has added two more\n\naccused persons viz. Accused no. 3 Saurabh and accused no. 6 Sandy\n\nas assailants who dealt knife blows to the deceased. As regards the\n\nuse of the tile for crushing the face of deceased by accused no. 1 Rohit,\n\naccused no. 2 Ketan and accused no. 6 Sandy, PW 5 Mangesh,\n\nhowever, reiterates the stand of PW 1 Akshay. These discrepancies, in\n\nour opinion, could perhaps be explained on account of missing of some\n\nof the details of the incident by witnesses owing to too many things\n\nhappening at the same time and hence are not really significant. But,\n\nwe must say, the variations, discrepancies and doubts pointed out by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">   ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                   ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                        24</span>\n\n\n\n\nus in preceding paragraphs cannot be dismissed as insignificant.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_55\">30.               Now, if we consider the cross-examinations of both these\n\nwitnesses, we would find that many of the facts stated by them before\n\nthe Court, were never stated by them either before the police or before\n\nthe learned Magistrate recording their statements under <a href=\"/doc/497457/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 164</a> of\n\nthe Code of Criminal Procedure or both and they also admitted that\n\nthey did not state these facts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">31.               The most important of the unstated facts or the omissions\n\nadmitted by these witnesses relate to the explanation that they have\n\nvoluntarily given by way of improvement before the Court about their\n\nbelated disclosure of the incident to the police and consequent delayed\n\nrecording of their statements under Section 161 Cr. P. C. According to\n\nPW 1 Akshay, the accused had not been arrested, that the accused had\n\nextended threats to those persons watching the incident of the dire\n\nconsequences if they were to say anything about the incident to the\n\npolice and that on his narration of the incident to his mother, he was\n\nadvised by his mother to not tell the incident to anybody and forget\n\neverything about the incident, were the reasons for his not coming\n\nforward to disclose to the police anything about the incident.\n\nAccording to PW 5 Mangesh, the reasons for him to withhold the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                  ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                        25</span>\n\n\n\n\ninformation about the incident from police were that the accused had\n\ngiven a threat of teaching a lesson and on his sharing the facts of the\n\nincident with his sister, he was advised by his sister to not disclose to\n\nanyone the incident as the accused persons could also kill him. So,\n\nthe reasons for these eye witnesses to not disclose the incident to the\n\npolice immediately after the incident or even a reasonable period of\n\ntime thereafter was the fear of the accused. The Investigating Officer\n\nPW 12 Bajrang Salunke has also given a explanation of similar kind.\n\nHe has stated that due to the incident, the people in the locality were\n\nterrified and, therefore, they were not giving any information about\n\nthe culprits. He has also stated that there was fear of the accused\n\npersons which made the eye witnesses withdraw themselves from the\n\nactive participation in the investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">32.               In the present case, the accused nos. 1 to 5 were arrested\n\non 6.7.2013 and accused no. 6 was arrested on 6.7.2013.                         The\n\nstatements of the eye witnesses PW 1 Akshay and PW 5 Mangesh were\n\nrecorded for the first time on 12 th July 2013 and their statements\n\nunder Section 164 Cr. P. C. were recorded much later in September\n\n2013. The fact that PW 1 Akshay was advised by his mother against\n\nany disclosure, has not been stated by him in his statement under\n\nSection 161 Cr. P. C. or in the statement recorded by the learned\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                   ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                    26</span>\n\n\n\n\nMagistrate. The fact that PW 5 Mangesh was also similarly counselled\n\nby his sister, has not been stated by him in both of his statements. This\n\nhas been admitted by both the witnesses. Their explanation is that\n\nthey were not asked about the same by the officer recording the\n\nstatements. The explanation cannot be accepted for the reason that\n\nthis was a fact which was within the exclusive knowledge of the\n\nwitnesses and that it was also a fact accepted by them to be material\n\nand, therefore, it was for these witnesses to have disclosed such a\n\nmaterial fact. Then, if the witnesses knew that it was a material fact\n\nwhich made them voluntarily state the same in their evidence before\n\nthe Court, nothing had prevented them from also similarly\n\nvolunteering an explanation before the concerned officer.                   The\n\nexplanation so given for the first time before the Court, therefore,\n\neither appears to be an afterthought on their part or a result of some\n\nsort of tutoring given to them.      As regards the tutoring of these\n\nwitnesses and they being influenced in some manner in giving\n\nevidence before the Court in favour of the prosecution, we would deal\n\nwith the same later. Presently, we find that the explanation given by\n\nthe two eye-witnesses in the nature of motherly or sisterly advise\n\nagainst non-disclosure of afore-stated material facts earlier is not\n\nsatisfactory and, therefore, we further find that a doubt is created\n\nabout their reliability.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">    ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                 ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                       27</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">33.               As regards the other reasons given by PW 1 Akshay and\n\nPW 5 Mangesh about their silence for a very long time, the terror of\n\nthe accused and threat of dire consequences issued by the accused, we\n\nfind that they belie the conduct of these witnesses and that there are\n\ntoo many open ends to accept these reasons as satisfactorily explaining\n\nthe inordinate delay.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">34.               These eye-witnesses have stated that after they learnt\n\nabout the arrest of the accused that they chose to come out of their\n\nshells and of their own accord went to the police station for making\n\nnecessary disclosures. Significantly, it is seen from their oral evidence\n\nthat these witnesses were carrying out their daily pursuits after the\n\nincident giving an impression of their generally not living under fear.\n\nPW 1 Akshay has gone to the extent of even admitting that during the\n\ninterregnum, police happened to visit his house twice and that he did\n\nnot tell to the Police anything about the incident then. PW 5 Mangesh\n\nhas admitted that he was attending to his daily pursuits after the\n\nincident.        These witnesses have not stated anything about any\n\nparticular fact which gave them an assurance that terror and fear of\n\nthe accused persons was a passe making them feel safe to approach the\n\npolice and disclose about the incident. At the cost of repetition, we\n\nwould refer to the relevant dates in this regard. The accused nos. 1 to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                            28</span>\n\n\n\n\n5 were arrested on 29.6.2013 and accused no. 6 was arrested on\n\n6.7.2013 and whereas statements of these witnesses were recorded on\n\n12.7.2013. The witnesses have not stated as to when did they learn\n\nabout the arrest of the accused persons and what made them feel so\n\nfree as to break loose.              These circumstances would show that the\n\nreasons as given by them for the delayed disclosure of incident to\n\nPolice are a figment of imagination and hence unsatisfactory.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">35.               We have made these findings by applying the settled\n\nprinciples of law. For the sake of convenience, we would like to refer\n\nhere to some of the cases laying down and reiterating the principles of\n\nlaw on the subject. They are as follows :-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">A)                Laxman         Bapurao    Ghaiwane    v.

It, therefore,\n\nheld the testimony of the witnesses as unreliable. The Division Bench\n\nfurther held that even though the delay by itself could not be a ground\n\nfor disbelieving and discarding the entire prosecution case, in absence\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                     ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                             29</span>\n\n\n\n\nof satisfactory explanation, the delay could be fatal to the prosecution.\n\n\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">B)               Amar Ramesh Lohkare v.

The Division Bench, following the law laid down in\n\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/406841/\" id=\"a_14\">Vadivelu Thevar &amp; anr v. State of Madras</a>, reported in\n\nAIR 1957 SC 614, held that since the Court was concerned with the\n\nquality and not with the quantity of the evidence, the oral testimony\n\ncould be broadly classified in three categories, viz. -</span>\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_3\">        (i)              wholly reliable\n\n        (ii)             wholly unreliable\n\n        (iii)            neither wholly reliable nor wholly unreliable\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_70\">                 The Division Bench held that in the first two categories of\n\nproof, there would be no difficulty in coming to the conclusion by\n\naccepting the evidence, but for the third category of proof, the Court\n\nhad to be circumspect and must look for corroboration in material\n\nparticulars       coming from reliable sources, direct or circumstantial.\n\nAssessing the prosecution evidence on the touchstone of these time\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">     ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                       ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                                       30</span>\n\n\n\n\ntested principles of law, the Division Bench found the evidence of two\n\neye witnesses, PW 1 Rajesh and PW 2 Vivek, as untrustworthy and\n\nunreliable, there being delay in performing their respective roles\n\nregarding disclosure of the incident, without giving any satisfactory\n\nexplanation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"104240276\" id=\"span_56\"><a href=\"/doc/104240276/\" id=\"a_15\">C)               Shahid Khan v.

There\n\nwas no corroboration to the evidence of the witnesses. In this setting\n\nof facts, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court held that unexplained silence and\n\ndelayed statements to police would make the eye witnesses appear to\n\nbe introduced witnesses making them wholly unreliable.\n\n\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1789800/\" id=\"a_16\">D)               State of UP v.

It has also held that if the\n\nexplanation offered for the delayed examination is plausible and\n\nacceptable, there would be no reason to interfere with the conclusion\n\nrecorded by the trial Court. The Hon&#x27;ble apex Court has further held\n\nthat when there is a delayed examination of the witnesses, the\n\nInvestigating Officer is required to be categorically asked as to why\n\nthere was delay in examination of the witnesses or otherwise the\n\ndefence cannot gain any advantage therefrom.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">36.               There is of course an explanation given by the\n\nInvestigating Officer for the delayed recording of the statements of PW\n\n1 Akshay and PW 5 Mangesh. He says that the witnesses were living\n\nunder the terror of the accused persons which made them keep silence\n\nfor a considerable period of time. This explanation on the face of it\n\nappears to be unsatisfactory, being an attempt on his part to explain\n\nhis own mistakes in the investigation, which has caused fatal damage\n\nto the prosecution&#x27;s case.           This is also the argument of learned senior\n\ncounsel and learned counsel for the accused persons though learned\n\nA.P.P. disagrees. The disagreement of the learned A.P.P. as we see, has\n\nno anchor in the facts and circumstance of the case.                   The learned\n\nA.P.P. points out that there is no categorical cross-examination of the\n\nInvestigating Officer made by the accused persons in this regard. It is\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                       ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">                                         32</span>\n\n\n\n\ntrue also. But the question is - has failure to cross-examine the\n\nInvestigating Officer on this issue really resulted in establishing the\n\npurity of the explanation given by the Investigating Officer ? In our\n\nopinion, the answer is in the negative.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">37.               We would say that it is difficult to lay down as proposition\n\nof law that in all cases where the explanation given by the witnesses or\n\nthe Investigating Officer on the delayed recording of the statements\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 161</a> of Criminal Procedure Code is not contravened in\n\nthe cross-examination by the accused, the explanation must be\n\naccepted as of diamond quality regardless of intrinsic worth of the\n\nexplanation. There is no denying the fact that prosecution can always\n\ndraw advantage from the failings and follies committed by the accused\n\nin the conduct of the cross-examination of a prosecution witness. But,\n\nit can do so only as a support, as an assurance, as a corroboration to\n\nthe truthfulness of the fact stated in the examination -in-chief and not\n\nas the original proof of the fact itself. A fact which necessarily has to\n\nbe proved by the prosecution must be established by it first and then\n\nonly failure to deny the fact or subject it to the test of cross-\n\nexamination would result in its complete acceptance or admission by\n\nthe accused.          Of course, there can be a situation where peculiar\n\nquestioning in the cross-examination of the prosecution witness brings\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                    ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                      33</span>\n\n\n\n\non record new material clearly incriminating the accused.                  These\n\nsituations are different and can shorten the task of the prosecution to\n\nprove the guilt of the accused. But, that situation is different where a\n\nfact is obscurely or untruly stated in the examination-in-chief itself. If\n\nthe fact stated in the examination-in-chief is vague, unclear or does not\n\nex-facie depict the truth, no failure to cross-examine a witness on such\n\na fact would be sufficient to draw any inference about proof of fact\n\nstated in the examination-in-chief. This is for the reason that burden of\n\nproof in a criminal case is always on the prosecution and it would shift\n\nto the accused when the initial burden is discharged by the\n\nprosecution.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">38.               In the present case, the explanation given by the\n\nInvestigating Officer is immanently not of sterling quality. Apart from\n\nit is being of vague nature, it also appears to be untrue. The reasons\n\nfor such a conclusion are to be found in the facts and circumstances\n\nbrought on record in the prosecution&#x27;s evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">39.               According to the prosecution evidence, Investigating\n\nOfficer, knew that there were witnesses to the incident and that\n\nnobody was coming forward to say anything about the incident. The\n\nInvestigating Officer had also visited at least twice the house of PW 1\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                 ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                                    34</span>\n\n\n\n\nAkshay in between the period from the date of incident i.e. 19.06.2013\n\nand recording of the statement of PW 1 i.e. on 12.07.2013 and that he\n\nhad also asked PW 1 Akshay if he knew anything about the incident to\n\nwhich admittedly, the answer given to him by PW 1 was that he was\n\nnot aware of the same. The statements of the two eye-witnesses were\n\nrecorded with inordinate delay and witnesses did not give any\n\ncategorical explanation about the reason for their maintaining silence\n\nabout the incident upto a particular date. According to eye-witnesses,\n\nthey were also advised respectively by their mother and sister to not\n\ndisclose anything about the incident to anybody. The eye-witnesses\n\nalso admitted the fact that advice so given to them by their mother and\n\nsister was not stated about by them at the time of recording of their\n\nstatements.      They say that they were not asked anything about the\n\ndelay by the Investigating Officer, if it is true.       In any case, an\n\nInvestigating Officer who had come to naught despite knowing that\n\npossibly there were some eye-witnesses would certainly ask the\n\nwitnesses approaching him after an inordinate delay as to what made\n\nthem speak up and why on that day they were coming to him. The\n\nevidence of the Investigating Officer does not throw any light on this\n\nimportant aspect of the case. In a case like this any reasonable man\n\nwould expect the Investigating Officer to visit the spot of incident and\n\nnearby areas and make public the arrest of all the accused, just to allay\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">   ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                  ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                               35</span>\n\n\n\n\nfear, if any, of the probable eye-witnesses so that they came forward\n\nand assisted the investigation. The Investigating Officer has maintained\n\nsilence in this regard as well, and no explanation either has been\n\noffered by him.

The cases of Ranbir and Sheo Shankar lay down the\n\nsame principles of law governing the delayed recording of statement of\n\na witness as discussed earlier.              They say that mere delay in\n\nexamination of a particular witness does not, as a rule of universal\n\napplication, render the case of the prosecution suspect and it would all\n\ndepend upon the explanation, if any, the Investigating Officer may\n\noffer for the delay. In Ranbir, it is also held that the fact of delayed\n\nexamination of a witness must be put to Investigating Officer so as to\n\nenable him to explain the delay, if any, in examining the particular\n\nwitness. In the present case, the Investigating Officer has himself given\n\nthe explanation for the delay, but the same has been found to be\n\nunsatisfactory, for the reasons stated earlier.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">43.               The case of Mahadeo is on the point of effect of\n\nimprovements made during the course of deposition of a witness. The\n\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court held in the facts and circumstances of that case\n\nthat the improvements which made the trial court suspect the veracity\n\nof the eye witnesses, were really not there and that in the first\n\ninformation report, important facts were implicitly stated and that it\n\nwas not expected of an informant to disclose all minute details of the\n\noccurrence in his report.            In the present case, there are many\n\nimprovements in the depositions of the eye witnesses, PW 1 Akshay\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                   ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                       37</span>\n\n\n\n\nand PW 5 Mangesh, which being material, as discussed earlier, have\n\namounted to contradictions, thereby magnifying their already doubtful\n\ntestimonies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">44.               The facts and circumstances discussed above reasonably\n\ncreate a possibility of PW 1 Akshay and PW 5 Mangesh being\n\nmanufactured witnesses for several reasons.       Their explanation and\n\nalso of the Investigating Officer on delayed recording of their\n\nstatements has been found to be unsatisfactory.               Secondly, the\n\nevidence of PW 1 Akshay and PW 5 Mangesh shows that both of them\n\nwere, as found earlier, leading a life during the period from the date\n\nof incident till recording of their statements, in a way which could be\n\ncalled as unperturbed, showing no signs of any dread. They were not\n\nconfined to their homes rather appeared to be carrying out their daily\n\npursuits as usual. PW 1 has gone to the extent of even informing the\n\nInvestigating Officer on being questioned by him that he did not know\n\nanything about the incident, which, even if examined in the context of\n\nhis initial fear, cannot ultimately be taken to be true for the reason that\n\neven after arrest of the accused persons, for several days, PW 1 Akshay\n\ndid not come forward to disclose about the incident. Thirdly, both the\n\nwitnesses were given active help by the Investigating Officer either in\n\nrecording of their statements or giving of evidence before the Court or\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                     38</span>\n\n\n\n\nboth.    PW 1 Akshay has admitted that he was given general\n\ninformation about the investigation by the Investigating Officer before\n\nrecording of his statement and that he came to the Court alongwith\n\ntwo Police Constables. Similarly, PW 5 Mangesh has also admitted\n\nthat before he entered the witness box, he went through his police\n\nstatement.     If they were genuine witnesses, we do not think, they\n\nwould have been required to be told about the case in this manner.\n\nThen, such help given by the prosecution to the key eye-witnesses was\n\nnot a case of refreshing of the memory of the witness by referring to\n\nthe copy of his statement under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 161</a> of Criminal Procedure\n\nCode after seeking permission of the Court in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1945359/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 159</a> of\n\nthe Indian Evidence Act, 1872, it having been done much before the\n\nexamination of the witness on oath and not while the witness was\n\nunder examination. It was all carried out behind the back of the Court\n\nand also the accused persons. If these witnesses were genuine, they\n\nwould not have required any such help from the Investigating Officer.\n\nBut the fact remains that it was given and that too in a manner not\n\npermissible under the law.        That only shows that both the eye-\n\nwitnesses are wholly unreliable and not only that, the kind of\n\nassistance given to them by the Investigating Officer has vitiated their\n\ntestimonies before the Court and rendered their evidence tainted.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">   ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                 ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">                                      39</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">45.               Apart from the testimonies of two eye-witnesses being\n\nwholly not trustworthy and even tainted, there are some more facts\n\nand circumstances, which further push the prosecution case into realm\n\nof doubt. To give some examples, we would refer to some of them,\n\nwhich in our opinion are significant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_90\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">46.               PW 5 Mangesh admits that he did not state before the\n\npolice that after the incident the accused persons fled away from the\n\nspot on moped and motor-cycle and that he along with PW 1 Akshay\n\nhad been to ice-cream parlour.        Similarly, PW 1 Akshay           did not\n\nadmittedly state before the police and the Magistrate that he had seen\n\nthe incident from a distance of about 70-80 feet and that after the\n\nincident, all the six accused persons left the spot of incident riding two\n\nmotor-cycles, each of which was occupied by three of them. He also\n\nadmits that when police came to his house, he told to them that he had\n\nno knowledge of the incident. The defence witness DW 1 states that\n\nspot of incident cannot be seen from the railing of the ice-cream\n\nparlour and there is a doubt, as discussed earlier, as to exactly from\n\nwhere the two eye-witnesses saw the incident. Then, the prosecution\n\nhas not examined as it&#x27;s witness mother of PW 1 Akshay and sister of\n\nPW 5 Mangesh although they had played important roles, according to\n\nthe eye-witnesses, in keeping them silent over the incident for a period\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                                               40</span>\n\n\n\n\nof twenty-three days after the incident and for a period of six days\n\nafter the arrest of the last of the accused, accused no. 6, on 6.7.2013.\n\nAll these facts and circumstances cumulatively give rise to a veritable\n\ndoubt about the prosecution case and, as the settled law indicates, now\n\nwe would have to look for corroboration and to ascertain if any\n\nsupport, for removal of doubts, is coming forth or not.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">47.               So, what would be now necessary for us is to see as to\n\nwhether or not there are any other eye witnesses or any other\n\nevidence, direct or circumstantial, which would help clear the doubt\n\nentertained by us about the creditworthiness of the two eye witnesses,\n\nPW 1 Akshay and PW 5 Mangesh. PW 4 Dilip and PW 6 Komal are\n\nrespectively the father and the widow of deceased Santosh. They\n\nwere not the eye witnesses and, therefore, their testimonies would be\n\nof no help to us. PW 2 Saurabh Humne was the pillion rider of the\n\nmotor-cycle rode by deceased Santosh Sare.                 He was, therefore, a\n\ngood witness in this case. But, the prosecution lost him on account of\n\nhis turning hostile.                 Even his cross-examination taken with the\n\npermission of the court by the learned APP did not yield any useful\n\nmaterial. There is no other direct evidence brought on record by the\n\nprosecution. Thus, the hunt for the other direct evidence which could\n\npossibly be used for corroborative purpose has stopped here.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                       ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                        41</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">48.               Now, we would turn to the circumstantial evidence and to\n\nour great dismay, we find that it is of no value in the eye of law. The\n\nclothes of the accused persons, the knives and the stick seized from\n\nthem were sent to the Regional Forensic Sciences Laboratory for\n\nchemical analysis and report. C. A. Report dated 30.12.2013 discloses\n\nthat the knife seized at the instance of accused no. 1 Rohit and the\n\nknife seized at the instance of accused Chandrya were stained with\n\nhuman blood of &quot;A&quot; group. Blood of deceased Santosh has been found\n\nto be of &quot;A&quot; group and so also of accused no. 1Rohit, accused no. 2\n\nKetan and accused no. 6 Sandy as of &quot;A&quot; group. The stick has also been\n\nfound to be having on it human blood. However, this evidence cannot\n\nbe accepted and deserves to be discarded for the reason that there is a\n\nhuge time-gap between seizure of the articles and their deposit in the\n\nMalkhana of Police Station. The seizures were made upto 4 th July,\n\n2013 and the seized articles were deposited in Malkhana on\n\n12.07.2013.          No explanation has been offered whatsoever by the\n\nInvestigation as to exactly where did he keep these articles from the\n\ndates of their seizure till there being deposited in the Police Station\n\nMalkhana and in what conditions these articles were kept.                     The\n\nInvestigating Officer has simply said that these articles were in his safe\n\ncustody, but has not explained as to what did he mean by that. So,\n\nthere is a doubt if the seized articles were sent for analysis and report\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_84\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                 ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                                               42</span>\n\n\n\n\nto Chemical Analysis or not and as such this circumstantial evidence is\n\nof no value in this case, and is discarded.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_94\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_95\">49.               Learned A.P.P. has also stressed upon presence of motive\n\nhere. In our opinion, so far as the present accused are concerned,\n\nmotive is not relevant for the reason that the direct and circumstantial\n\nevidence led by the prosecution on the commission of the crime\n\ninvolved here, itself has failed to show the guilt of the accused therein\n\nbeyond any reasonable doubt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_96\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_97\">50.               The      result      of    the   discussion    thus      far     made\n\nis that the evidence of the two eye witnesses PW 1 Akshay\n\nand PW 5                Mangesh is wholly unreliable so much so that\n\nthey     appear       to be got-up witnesses and that                   there is no\n\ncorroboration coming from anywhere to the versions stated by them\n\nbefore      the     Court.           There   are   also   some    discrepancies         of\n\nsignificant nature in their versions. They were also assisted by the\n\nInvestigating Officer either in recording of their statements or\n\ntestifying before the Court or both.                All these aspects of the case\n\nthough material were not considered by the learned trial Judge,\n\nand the result is that of a mistaken appreciation of evidence leading to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">      ::: Uploaded on - 04/09/2019                         ::: Downloaded on - 18/04/2020 01:27:34 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                        43</span>\n\n\n\n\nconclusions not logically arising from the evidence available on record.\n\nThis is a case where benefit of doubt ought to have been given to the\n\naccused persons who are appellants before us and now, the same\n\nwould be given to them by us.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_98\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_99\">51.               Thus, we find that the prosecution has failed to prove the\n\ncharge for the offence for which the accused persons/appellants have\n\nbeen found guilty and convicted by the trial Court in the impugned\n\njudgment and order and that they deserve to be acquitted of the same\n\nby allowing all the appeals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_101\">52.
