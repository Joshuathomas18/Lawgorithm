Later on. Shri Vijayan, and K.\nNandi, an  Advocate, got themselves impleaded as respondents\nin those  writ petitions. During hearing of the petitions it\nwas,  inter  alia,  contended  on  behalf  of  the  accused-\nappellants that\t the Government\t of Kerala was not competent\nto order  further investigation\t by its Police Officers into\nthe allegations\t which had already been investigated into by\nthe C.B.I.  Accordingly, they  prayed for  quashing  of\t the\nnotification  dated   June  27,\t 1996,\tas  amended  by\t the\nnotification dated July 8, 1996. In supporting the accused -\nappellants ,  the C.B.I. first submitted that as the consent\ngiven  under   <a href=\"/doc/1868602/\" id=\"a_18\">Section\t6</a>   of\tthe   Delhi  Special  Police\nEstablishment Act  (&#x27;Act&#x27; for short) fell in the category of\nconditional legislation,   the\tquestion of withdrawal could\nnot and\t did not  arise for  the powers conferred thereunder\nhad   exhausted\t   themselves\twith   the   initiation\t  of\nInvestigation by  it. It  next submitted  that in  case\t any\nfurther evidence  surfaced, the\t Government of\tKerala could\nonly refer the same to the C.B.I. for it was alone competent\nto further  investigate into  the matter.  By  its  judgment\ndated November\t27, 1996  the High Court of Kerala dismissed\nthe writ  petitions on\tthe ground that the matter of giving\nor withholding of consent under <a href=\"/doc/1872557/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 6</a> of t he Act was an\nexecutive active  of the  State Government  and the said Act\nwas not a piece of conditional legislation. According to the\nHigh Court  <a href=\"/doc/141478/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 21</a>\tof the\tGeneral\t Clauses  Act,\t1897\napplied to  the notification in question and, therefore, the\nwithdrawal of the consent by  Government of Kerala could not\nbe said\t to be\tinvalid. Lastly,  the  Court  observed\tthat\nalthough there\twas no\tstatutory requirement  for the State\nPolice to  obtain permission  from the\tCourt  concerned  to\nfurther investigate  into the  matter, it should obtain such\npermission in  view of the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/889775/\" id=\"a_21\">Ram Lal\nNarang vs. State</a> [1979 SCC (Crl.) 479).

In expanding his submission\nMr. Altaf  Ahmed argued\t that  the  Act\t being\ta  piece  of\nconditional legislation\t the action taken or power exercised\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1872557/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 6</a> thereof was not reversible and, consequently\nthe question of applying the provisions of Section 21 of the\nGeneral clauses Act, which pertains to action taken or power\nexercised, which  is reversible,  could not arise. According\nto Mr.\tAltaf  Ahmad,  the  power  conferred  on  the  State\nGovernment under  <a href=\"/doc/1872557/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 6</a> of the Act exhausted itself once\nit was exercised by granting consent and nothing was left of\nit and resultantly, when the investigation was undertaken by\nC.B.I. pursuant\t thereto, by  invoking <a href=\"/doc/190959557/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 5</a> of the Act,\nit could  not be  rolled back by withdrawal, by the impugned\nnotification. In  other words, according to Mr. Altaf Ahmad,\nthe power under <a href=\"/doc/1872557/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 6</a> of the Act having exhausted itself\nnothing remained for reversing the exercise of such a power.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">16.  Mr. Salve, appearing for S.K. Sharam ( the appellant in\nCriminal Appeal\t No. 491  of 1997), first drew our attention\nto a  notification being  No. 7/5/55-  AVD dated November 6,\n1956 issued  by the  Government of  India in exercise of its\npowers conferred  by <a href=\"/doc/64934656/\" id=\"a_40\">Section  3</a> of  the Act,  specifying the\noffences and classes of offences to be investigated by Delhi\nSpecial police\tEstablishment (Which  include offences under\nthe I.O.S.  Act, 1923)\tand a letter dated December 14, 1956\naddressed by  the Chief Secretary of Government of Kerala to\nan Under  Secretary of\tthe Government\tof India. Intimating\nthat the Government of Kerala had accorded their consent for\nthe  members  of  the  Delhi  Special  Police  establishment\nexercising powers  and\tjurisdiction  within  the  State  of\nKerala in  respect of  the offences  specified in  the above\nnotification, and  submitted  that  the\t notification  dated\nDecember 2,  1994 granting  consent (  and for\tthat  matter\nwithdrawal thereof)  only for  Investigating into No. 246/94\nwas redundant for by virtue of the earlier letter of general\nconsent, the  C.B.I. was  competent to\tinvestigate into all\noffences mentioned  in the  notification dated\tNovember  6,\n1956  including\t  the  offences\t  in  question.\t  His\tmain\nsubmission, however,  was that once a consent was given by a\nState Government  empowering the  C.B.I. to investigate into\nan offence,  the former\t could not  withdraw  the  same.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1911405\" id=\"span_2\">In\nsupport of  this contention  he relied upon the judgement of\nthis Court  in <a href=\"/doc/1911405/\" id=\"a_41\">Kazi  Lhendup Dorji  vs.\t Central  Bureau  of\nInvestigation</a> [\t 1994 Supp (2) SCC 116]. His last submission\nwas that  the  withdrawal  of  the  consent  was  clearly  a\nmalafide action\t on the part of the Government of Kerala. To\nbring home this contention, he relied upon certain facts and\ncircumstances appearing on record, to which we will refer at\nthe appropriate stage.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">17.  The learned  counsel appearing  for the other accused -\nappellants,  and   appellant  D.   Sasikumaran\tadopted\t and\nreiterated the\tsubmissions made  by Mr. Altaf Ahmad and Mr.\nSalve.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">18.  In refuting  the above contentions, Mr. Shanti Bhushan,\nthe learned  counsel appearing for the State of Kerala along\nwith its  Advocate General,  submitted that  t he  Act\tonly\nenables C.B.I.\tto investigate\tinto offences  specified  as\ncontemplated by <a href=\"/doc/64934656/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 3</a>, but does not in any way take away\nthe right  of the  State Police\t to investigate\t into  those\noffences.  He  pointed\tout  that  the\toffences  for  which\nnotifications have  been  issued  under\t <a href=\"/doc/64934656/\" id=\"a_43\">Section  3</a>  include\noffences under\t<a href=\"/doc/839778/\" id=\"a_44\">Sections 380</a>  and <a href=\"/doc/812083/\" id=\"a_45\">411</a>  I.P.C. and  submitted\nthat it would be absurd to suggest that the State Police was\ndenuded of  its powers to investigate into those offences in\naccordance with\t Chapter XII  of the Code merely because the\nC.B.I.\thas   been  empowered\tto  investigate\t into  those\noffences. In  elaborating this\tcontention he submitted that\nthe power  to investigate  a cognizable case is conferred on\nthe officer-in-charge  of a police station under Section 156\n(1) of\tthe Code  (appearing in Chapter XII) and in exercise\nthereof he  can investigate  any such  case  which  a  Court\nhaving jurisdiction over the local area within the limits of\nsuch station  would have  power to inquire into or try under\nthe provision  of Chapter  XIII. he  drew our  attention  to\nChapter XIII  (which relates  to  the  jurisdiction  of\t the\ncriminal Courts\t in inquiries  and trials)  of the  Code and\nargued that Sections 177 to 184 appearing therein would show\nthat more  than one  Court have\t territorial jurisdiction to\ninquire\t into\tand  try   the\tsame   offence.\t By  way  of\nillustration he\t made a\t particular reference to Section 183\nto contend that if a murder was committed in a train all the\nCourts, having territorial jurisdiction in the areas through\nwhich the  train was  passing, would be competent to try the\noffence. That, according to him, necessarily meant that each\none of the Officers-in-charge of the Police Stations through\nwhich the train passed would be competent to investigate the\noffence of  murder in  view of the plain language of Section\n156 (1)\t of the\t Code and  none\t of  them  could  claim\t any\nexclusive jurisdiction\tto investigate. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"136961\" id=\"span_3\">Of course, he added,\nif on  the filling  of charge-sheets  on completion of their\nrespective investigations,  Courts in  different States took\ncognizance of  that offence  the High  Court would  have  to\ndecide under  Section 186  of the  Code as to which of those\nCourts would  try the offence. He contended that Section 186\nof the Code clearly demonstrates that while the law does not\ncontemplate  parallel\ttrials\tfor   the  same\t offence  in\ndifferent  Courts  it  does  clearly  envisage\tparallel  or\nsimultaneous investigations  of the  Same offence  by police\nofficials of  different States. He reiterated that since the\nlaw  does   not\t prohibit   simultaneous  investigation\t  by\ndifferent investigation\t agencies into\tthe same  offence if\neach one of them has been conferred powers of investigation,\nthe issuance of an order under <a href=\"/doc/33974374/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 5(1)</a> of the Act along\nwith the  consent of  the State\t Government under  <a href=\"/doc/1872557/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 6</a>\nthereof would  only mean that the officers of the C.B.I. can\nalso  investigate   into  that\t offence.  To  buttress\t his\ncontention he  drew our\t attention to  the judgment  of t he\nCourt in  <a href=\"/doc/136961/\" id=\"a_48\">A.C. Sharma  v. Delhi Administration</a> [(1973) 1 SCC\n726]. In  that case  the  following  question  came  up\t for\nconsideration (as formulated by this Court in paragraph 6 of\nthe judgment:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">     This short\t but important\tquestion\n     with far  reaching effect,\t if  the\n     appellant&#x27;s  contention   were   to\n     prevail, requiring our decision is,\n     whether with the setting up of  the\n     Delhi special Police Establishment,\n     the Anti  Corruption Branch  of the\n     Delhi Police  had\tbeen  completely\n     deprived\tof    its    power    to\n     investigate into  the offences like\n     the present  or  whether  both  the\n     DSPE and the Anti Corruption Branch\n     had power to investigation it being\n     a matter of Internal administrative\n     arrangement  for\tthe  appropriate\n     authorities   to\t regulate    the\n     assignment\t of   investigation   of\n     cases according  to the  exigencies\n     of the situation.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">19.  After referring  to the  scheme of\t this  Act  and\t its\ndifferent provisions the Court answered the same as under:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     &quot; The  scheme of  this Act does not\n     either expressly  or  by  necessary\n     implication  divest   the\t regular\n     police   authorities    of\t   their\n     jurisdiction, powers and competence\n     to investigate  into offences under\n     any  other\t  competent  law.  As  a\n     general  rule,   it  would\t require\n     clear  and\t  express  language   to\n     effectively exclude  as a matter of\n     law the  power of\tinvestigation of\n     all the  offences mentioned in this\n     notification from\tthe jurisdiction\n     and  competence   of  the\t regular\n     police  authorities   conferred  on\n     them by  <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_49\">Cr.P.C</a>. and other laws and\n     to vest  this power  exclusively in\n     the  <a href=\"/doc/1692639/\" id=\"a_50\">D.S.P.E..   The  D.S.P.E.

On the  basis  of\tthe  law  so  laid  down,  the\tlast\nsubmission of  Mr. Shanti Bhushan on this point was that the\npower of C.B.I. to investigate into the offences in question\nwas not\t exclusive but\tconcurrent with the State Police. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1911405\" id=\"span_4\">In\ndistinguishing the  case of  <a href=\"/doc/1911405/\" id=\"a_52\">Kazi Lhendup Dorji</a> (supra), mr.\nShanti Bhushan\tsubmitted that\tthat was  a case  where\t the\nconsent was  sought   to be  withdrawn at  a stage  when the\ninvestigation was  in progress,\t but in the instant case, as\nthe C.B.I.  had\t already  completed  the  investigation\t and\nsubmitted its  report in final form the State Government was\nfully justified\t in withdrawing\t the consent  for  making  a\nproper investigation into the offence in question.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">21.  In responding  to the  argument of the appellants based\non <a href=\"/doc/141478/\" id=\"a_53\">Section  21</a> of  the General Clauses Act he submitted that\nthe  said   Section  was   applicable  to   conferments\t  of\nadministrative power  only and not to conferment of judicial\nor quasi  judicial powers  and since  grant of consent under\n<a href=\"/doc/1872557/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 6</a>  of the  Act was  merely an  administrative  power\nwithdrawal thereof would be permissible under that section.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"136961\" id=\"span_5\">22.  We are  constrained to say that the entire argument Mr.\nShanti Bhushan centring round Section 156, read with Chapter\nXIII, of the Code is fallacious; and the fallacy lies in the\nbasic premise on which he sought to build his argumentations\nedifice. In  the present  appeals, we are not concerned with\nthe question  of  initiation  of  parallel  or\tsimultaneous\ninvestigation by  two different\t agencies, viz.\t C.B.I.\t and\nstate police  in two separate cognizable cases registered at\ntwo different  places over  on and the\tsame offence. We are\nalso not concerned with the question whether both C.B.I. and\nKerala\t Police\t   have/had   jurisdiction    to    initiate\ninvestigation into  the offences  in  questions\t [answer  to\nwhich has  already been\t given in  the case  of <a href=\"/doc/136961/\" id=\"a_55\">A.C.  Sharma</a>\n(supra)].  Indeed,   the  question   that  falls   for\t our\ndetermination is altogether different: and that is, when the\ninvestigation into  an offence\tis transferred and entrusted\nto C.B.I.  for investigation pursuant to consent given under\n<a href=\"/doc/1872557/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 6</a> of the Act and the C.B.I. has not only started but\ncompleted the  investigation armed  with  that\tconsent\t and\nsubmitted its report under Section 173(2) of the Code can be\nstate Government  withdraw the\tconsent and,  if so, what is\nthe effect thereof.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1911405\" id=\"span_6\">23.  To answer\tthe above question it will be appropriate to\nfirst refer  to the  case of <a href=\"/doc/1911405/\" id=\"a_57\">Kazi Lhendup Dorji</a> (supra) . In\nthat case  by a\t letter dated October 20, 1976, addressed to\nthe Deputy Secretary to the Government of India ( Department\nof  Personnel\tand  Administration   Reforms),\t the   Chief\nSecretary to  the Government  of Sikkim conveyed the consent\nof its\tGovernment under  <a href=\"/doc/1872557/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 6</a>  to the  members of\t the\nDelhi Special  Police Establishment in exercising powers and\njurisdiction  in   the\tentire\t State\tof  Sikkim  for\t the\ninvestigation of  the\toffences  punishable  under  various\nprovisions of  the <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_59\">Indian  Penal Code</a>  specified therein  as\nwell as\t offences under\t the <a href=\"/doc/33237157/\" id=\"a_60\">Prevention\t of Corruption\tAct,\n1947</a>. Thereafter  on May  26, 1984  a case was registered by\nthe C.B.I. against Shri Narbahadur Bhandari, erstwhile Chief\nminister of  Sikkim, for  offences punishable  under <a href=\"/doc/172911040/\" id=\"a_61\">Section\n5(2)</a> read  with 5(1)(e) of the prevention of <a href=\"/doc/33237157/\" id=\"a_62\">Corruption Act,\n1947</a> on\t the allegation\t that  while  acting  as  the  Chief\nMinister and  thus being  a public  servant, he had acquired\nassets disproportionate\t to his\t known\tsources\t of  income.\nAnother case  was thereafter  registered by  the  C.B.I.  on\nAugust 7,  1984\t against  Shri\tBhandari  and  others  under\n<a href=\"/doc/172911040/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 5(2)</a>  read with\t (5)(1) (d)  of the  same Act. After\nregistering   those    two   cases    the   C.B.I.   started\ninvestigation; and  when the  cases were under investigation\nShri Bhandari  reassumed the office of the Chief Minister on\nMarch  19,   1985.  While  he  was  holding  that  office  a\nnotification was issued on January 7,1987 notifying that all\nconsents of  or on  behalf of  the State  Government earlier\ngiven under  <a href=\"/doc/1872557/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 6</a>\tof  the\t Act  for  investigation  of\noffence by  C.B.I. are\twithdrawn and  stand cancelled\twith\nimmediate effect.  As a\t consequence of\t that  notification,\nC.B.I. suspended  further action  in the  aforementioned two\ncases against  Shri Bhandari,  Shri Dorji, who also happened\nto be  a former\t Chief Minister of Sikkim, then filed a writ\npetition  before   this\t Court\t under\t<a href=\"/doc/981147/\" id=\"a_65\">Article\t 32</a>  of\t the\nConstitution of India contending that there was no provision\nin the\tAct which empowered the State Government to withdraw\nthe consent  which had\tbeen accorded  and consequently, the\nimpugned notification dated January 7, 1987, withdrawing the\nconsent was  in violation  of the  provisions of the Act. In\ncontesting the\tpetition Shri  Bhandari (who  was arrayed as\nRespondent No.\t4 therein)  contended, inter  alia, that the\nconsent given  under <a href=\"/doc/1872557/\" id=\"a_66\">Section 6</a> of the Act could be rescinded\nunder <a href=\"/doc/141478/\" id=\"a_67\">Section  21</a> of  the  General  Clauses  Act,  1897.  In\nallowing the petition this court held;-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">     &quot; Coming to the conclusion urged by\n     Shri Jethmalani on merits it may be\n     mentioned that  <a href=\"/doc/141478/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 21</a>\t of  the\n     General Clauses Act does not confer\n     a power  to issue\tan order  having\n     retrospective operation.

If\tthus construed\tit would\n     mean that\tinvestigation  which was\n     commenced\t by    CBI   prior    to\n     withdrawal\t of  consent  under  the\n     impugned  notification  dated  7-1-\n     1987, had\tto be  completed and  it\n     was  not\taffected  by   the  said\n     withdrawal\t of  consent.  In  other\n     words, the\t CBI  was  competent  to\n     complete the  investigation in  the\n     cases  registered\t by  it\t against\n     Respondent 4  and other persons and\n     submit the report under <a href=\"/doc/1412034/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 173</a>\n     CrPC in  the  competent  Court.  On\n     that view\tof the matter, It is not\n     necessary to  go into  the question\n     whether the  provisions of\t <a href=\"/doc/141478/\" id=\"a_73\">Section\n     21</a> of  the General\t Clauses Act can\n     be invoked\t in relation  to consent\n     given under <a href=\"/doc/1030013/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 6</a> of the Act.&quot;\n\t  (emphasis supplied)\n     In view  of the law so <a href=\"/doc/1911405/\" id=\"a_75\">laid down by</a> a three Judge Bench\nof this Court, it must be held that an investigation started\nby C.B.I. with the consent of the State Government concerned\ncannot be stopped midway by withdrawing the consent.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1911405\" id=\"span_8\">24.  Since, in the present case, unlike that of <a href=\"/doc/1911405/\" id=\"a_76\">Kazi Lhendup\nDorji</a> (supra),\tthe consent was withdrawn after report under\nSection\t 173(2)\t  Cr.

In drawing\nthis conclusion we have also drawn inspiration from the fact\nthat sub-section (8) clearly envisages that on completion of\nfurther\t investigation\t the  investigating  agency  has  to\nforward to  the Magistrate  a &#x27;further&#x27;\t report or reports -\nand not\t fresh report  or reports-  regarding the  &#x27;further&#x27;\nevidence obtained  during such\tinvestigation.\tOnce  it  is\naccepted -  and it  has got  to be  accepted in\t view of the\njudgment  in   <a href=\"/doc/1911405/\" id=\"a_77\">Kazi  Lhendup   Dorji</a>  (supra)\t-  that\t  an\nInvestigation  undertaken  by  CBI  pursuant  to  a  consent\ngranted under  <a href=\"/doc/1030013/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 6</a>  of the  Act is  to  be  completed,\nnotwithstanding withdrawal of the consent, and that &#x27;further\ninvestigation&#x27; is a continuation of such investigation which\nculminates in  a further police report under sub-section (8)\nof Section  173, it  necessarily means\tthat  withdrawal  of\nconsent in  the instant\t case would  not entitle  the  State\nPolice, to  further investigate\t into the  case. To  put  it\ndifferently, if\t any further  investigation is to be made it\nis the C.B.I. alone which can do so, for it was entrusted to\ninvestigate  into   the\t case\tby  the\t  State\t Government.\nResultantly, the notification issued withdrawing the consent\nto enable  the State  Police to further investigate into the\ncase is\t patently invalid  and unsustainable in law. In view\nof this\t finding of  ours we need not go into the questions,\nwhether <a href=\"/doc/141478/\" id=\"a_79\">Section\t 21</a> of\tthe General  Clauses Act and whether\nconsent given  for investigating  into Crime  No. 246/94 was\nredundant in  view of  the general  consent earlier given by\nthe State of Kerala.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">26.  Even if  we were  to hold that the State Government had\nthe requisite  power and  authority to\tissue  the  impugned\nnotification, still  the same  would be liable to be quashed\non the\tground of malafide exercise of power. Eloquent proof\nthereof\t is   furnished\t  by   the   following\t facts\t and\ncircumstances as appearing on the record:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">(i)  while  requesting\t the  Director\tGeneral\t of  Police,\n     Thiruvananthapuram, to  transfer the case to C.B.I. for\n     investigation  by\t his  letter  dated  30.11.94,\tShri\n     Mathew, the Deputy Inspector General of Police (who, as\n     noticed earlier,  impleaded himself  as a respondent in\n     the writ petitions filed by the accused - appellants in\n     the High Court) Stated as under:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">     &quot; (1)  The incidents  of this  case\n     are spread over the three states of\n     Kerala, Tamilnadu and Karnataka and\n     foreign locations\tlike Colombo and\n     Male.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">     (2) There is reason to believe that\n     strategically important information\n     about the\tIAF/Armed Forces  (R &amp; D\n     Wing )  have been\tpassed on by the\n     espionage\t chain\t to   unfriendly\n     countries.

If the  above\nformidable  impediments\t stood\tin  the\t way  of  the  State\nGovernment to  get the\tcase properly  investigated  by\t its\npolice and  impelled it\t to hand  over the investigation the\nC.B.I. it  is hardly  conceivable that\tthe State Government\nwould be  able to  pursue the  investigation effectively  as\nthose impediments would still be there. Mr. Shanti Bhushan ,\nhowever, contended,  relying upon  the\tfollowing  Statement\nmade by\t Shri K.  Dasan,  an  Additional  Secretary  to\t the\nGovernment of  Kerala in  his counter-\taffidavit  (filed on\nFebruary 20, 1997 in Criminal Appeal No. 489 of 1997): -\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">     &quot; Having  regard to the question of\n     public importance\tinvolved in this\n     matter the\t Government ordered that\n     further  investigation   should  be\n     taken by  a Special  team handed by\n     senior officials  of  Kerala  state\n     police assisted by senior officials\n     of the Intelligence Bureau, RAW and\n     intelligence wing\tin  the\t defence\n     organisation of Govt. of India.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">     That there\t would be  no difficulty  in carrying  on an\neffective and  purposeful investigation\t with the assistance\nof the\trelated organisations  of  the\tCentral\t Government.\nHaving regard  to the  stand taken by the Central Government\nthat they  are satisfied with the report of investigation of\nthe  C.B.I.   we  are  not  prepared  to  accept  the  above\nstatement, in  the absence  of any  supporting affidavit  on\nbehalf\tof   the  Government   of  India  or  any  of  those\norganisations; (ii)  On a  careful  perusal  of\t the  police\nreport\tsubmitted   by\tthe  C.B.I.  on\t completion  of\t the\ninvestigation (which  runs through  more than  100 pages) we\nfind that  it has  made a  detailed investigation  from\t all\npossible angles\t before\t drawing  the  conclusion  that\t the\nallegations of espionage did not stand proved and were found\nto be false. mr. Shanti Bhushan, however, drew our attention\nto certain  passages from that report to contend that C.B.I.\nonly &#x27;Investigated  the Investigation&#x27;\t(to use the words of\nMr. Shanti Bhushan), which had been carried on for less than\nthree weeks by the Kerala police and the Intelligence Bureau\nof the\tCentral Government,  in its  (C.B.I.&#x27;s)\t anxiety  to\nestablish that\tthe statements\tof the\taccused - appellants\nrecorded by  the Kerala\t Police and  the Intelligence Bureau\ncould not be accepted as correct. He also drew out attention\nto pages 7 to 15 of the counter affidavit filed by Shri T.P.\nSen Kumar,  Deputy Inspector  General of Police, Kerala ( In\nCriminal Appeal\t No. 491 of 1997) , wherein detailed reasons\nhave been  given  for  not  accepting\t the  police  report\nsubmitted by  the C.B.I.  and  for  the\t State\tGovernment&#x27;s\ndecision to  withdraw the consent. After having gone through\nthe relevant  averments made in those pages we find that the\nmain endeavour\tof Shri\t Sen Kumar  has been  to demonstrate\nthat the  conclusions arrived  at by  the  C.B.I.  from\t the\nmaterials collected  during investigation were wrong and not\nthat  the   investigation  was\till  directed  or  that\t the\nmaterials collected  in course\tthereof were insufficient or\nirrelevant.  If\t  the  State   Government  found   that\t the\nconclusions drawn  by the  C.B.I. were\tnot proper, the only\ncourse left  to the State Government, in our opinion, was to\nask the\t Central Government  to take a different view of the\nmaterials collected  during investigation and persuade it to\nlodge a\t complaint in  accordance with\tSection 13  of\t the\nI.O.S. Act.  The contention  of Mr.  Shanti Bhushan that the\nC.B.I. only  &#x27;investigated into\t the investigation&#x27;  is also\nwithout any  basis whatsoever  for we  find that  keeping in\nview the  statements made by some of the accused appellants,\nthe C.B.I.  sought for\tthe assistance of INTERPOL and got a\nnumber of  persons examined by them in Srilanka and Maldives\n[besides a  number of  witnesses in India, who were examined\nby it  (C.B.I.)]. Further, we find that the State Government\ndid not\t canvass any  satisfactory ground justifying further\ninvestigation,\twhile\tseeking\t permission   of  the  Chief\nJudicial Magistrate for that purpose;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">(iii)\t  Though the  investigation  of\t the  case  centered\n     round espionage activities in I.S.R.O. no complaint was\n     made by  it  to  that  effect  nor\t did  it  raise\t any\n     grievance on  that score.\tOn the\tcontrary,  from\t the\n     police report  submitted by  the C.B.I.  we  find\tthat\n     several scientists\t of this  organisation were examined\n     and from  the statements  made by\tthose  officers\t the\n     C.B.I. drew the following conclusion:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">     &quot; The  sum\t and  substance\t of  the\n     aforesaid statements  is that  ISRO\n     does   not\t  have\t a   system   of\n     classifying drawings/documents.  In\n     other words,  the document\t drawing\n     are  not\tmarked\tas  Top\t Secret,\n     Secret, confidential  or classified\n     etc. Further,  ISRO follows an open\n     door policy  in regard to the issue\n     of documents  to scientists.  Since\n     ISRO,  is\t a   research\toriented\n     organisation, any scientist wanting\n     to study any document is free to go\n     to the  Documentation  Cell/Library\n     and study the documents. As regards\n     the issue\tof documents  to various\n     Divisions, the  procedure was  that\n     only the  copies used  to be issued\n     to the  various divisions on indent\n     after duly entering the same in the\n     Documentation   Issue    Registers.\n     during investigation,  it has  been\n     revealed  that   Fabrication  Divn.</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">     where   accused   sasikumaran   was\n     working, various  drawings\t running\n     into 16,800  sheets were issued and\n     after   his    transfer   to   SAP,\n     Ahmedabad\ton  7.11.1994,\tall  the\n     copies of\tthe drawings  were found\n     to be intact. Nambi Narayan being a\n     senior scientist, though had access\n     to the  drawings, but  at no  stage\n     any drawings/documents  were  found\n     to have  been issued  to him.  they\n     have also\tstated it  was usual for\n     scientists\t    to\t    take     the\n     documents/drawings required for any\n     meetings/discussions    to\t   their\n     houses for study purposes. In these\n     circumstances, the\t allegation that\n     Nambai  Narayan   and   Sasikumaran\n     might have\t passed on the documents\n     to a  third party,\t is found  to be\n     false. &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">     It further\t appears that  at the  instance of  C.B.I, a\ncommittee of  senior Scientists was constituted to ascertain\nwhether any  classified documents  of the  organisation were\nstolen or  found missing  and their  report shows that there\nwas no\tsuch missing  documents. There cannot, therefore, be\nany scope  for further Investigation in respect of purported\nespionage activities  in that  organisation  in\t respect  of\nwhich only  the Kerala\tpolice would  have  jurisdiction  to\ninvestigate;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">(iv) The Government  of India, by supporting the case of the\nwrit petitioners  ( the\t accused -  appellants) in  the High\nCourt, and filing some of these appeals in this Court and an\naffidavit connection  therewith has,  in no uncertain terms,\nmade it\t abundantly clear  that they  are satisfied with the\ninvestigation conducted\t by the\t C.B.I.\t and  they  strongly\noppose any  attempt on\tthe part  of the State Government to\nfurther investigate  into the  matter by its police. Inspite\nthereof the  State Government  has had\t been  pursuing\t the\nmatter\tzealously   and\t strongly  defending  their  action,\nknowing fully  well that a prosecution can be launched by or\nat the instance of Central Government only. Having known the\nstand of  the Government  of India  it was  expected of\t the\nGovernment of  Kerala to withdraw the impugned notification,\nfor in the ultimate analysis any further investigation by it\nwould be an exercise in futility; and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">(v)   Though, [as  held by  this Court in Jamuna v. State of\nBihar (A.I.R. 1974 S.C. 1822)] the duty of the Investigating\nAgency is  not merely  to boister up a prosecution case with\nsuch evidence as may enable the Court to record a conviction\nbut to\tbring out the real unvarnished truth, yet the kerala\nGovernment wants the instant case to be further investigated\nby a  team  nominated  by  it  with  the  avowed  object  of\nestablishing that  the accused - appellants are guilty, even\nafter the  investigating agency\t of its\t choice, the C.B.I.,\nfound that no case had been made out against them. This will\nbe evident  from the  followed passage\tfrom the order dated\nDecember 13,  1996 passed  by the Chief Judicial Magistrate,\nThiruvananthapuram while  granting permission  to the Kerala\nPolice to further investigate :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">     &quot;\tThe   report  submitted\t by  the\n     Director\t General    of\t  Police\n     disclosed the  fact that the he has\n     got reliable  information that  the\n     conclusions  arrived   at\tby   the\n     C.B.I.  during  investigation  were\n     not correct.
