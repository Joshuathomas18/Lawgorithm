He submitted\n\n   that there is no offence of organized crime which was\n\n   committed within the territory of Delhi.

All    the    antecedent   events   that   were\n\n   mentioned in the said FIR pertain to activities in the State of\n\n   Uttar Pradesh.           He submitted that no organised crime was\n\n   committed in Delhi and FIR No.69 of 2007 cannot be taken\n\n   into consideration for proceeding against the Respondents\n\n   under MCOCA.

The judgments of the House of Lords pertain to offences\n\n   committed outside the country being tried when the\n\n   consequences of such offences are within the country. We\n\n   have referred to these judgments only to explain that the\n\n   principle of ‘Crime is local’ is not applicable where the\n\n   detrimental effect is in another State which can try the\n\n   offender. In any event, the Respondents are not being tried\n\n   for the offences which are subject matter of charge sheets\n\n   filed in the State of Uttar Pradesh.                      The cases in which\n\n   charge sheets are filed in competent Courts outside Delhi\n\n   shall be tried in those Courts and are taken into account only\n\n   for    determining          the     antecedents      of    the     Respondents.\n\n   Therefore, the submission on behalf of the Respondents that\n\n   the     crimes        committed           outside   the    State    cannot   be\n\n   considered for any purpose whatsoever is rejected.                           The\n\n   upshot of the above discussion is that there should be a\n\n   minimum of two charge sheets of organized crime registered\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                             30</span>\n\fCriminal Appeal @SLP(Crl.)

However, we are in agreement with the submission of the\n\n   learned Senior Counsel for the Respondents that an activity\n\n   of organized crime in Delhi is a sine qua non for registration\n\n   of a crime under MCOCA.                   In the absence of an organized\n\n   crime being committed in Delhi, the accused cannot be\n\n   prosecuted on the basis of charge sheets filed outside Delhi.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_71\">33.

This notification was quashed by\n\n   the High Court of Delhi on 13.01.2003.                          A second\n\n   notification for the same purpose was issued by the Delhi\n\n   Government on 31.03.2004 which was challenged in W.P.

The High Court of Delhi initially stayed and\n\n   ultimately         struck       down      the   second   notification   on\n\n   18.01.2016. As such, <a href=\"/doc/180217/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 506</a> IPC was a non-cognizable\n\n   offence at the date of registration of the FIR and filing of the\n\n   charge sheet.

FIR No.69 of 2007 was registered on the basis of\n\n   information given by one Sudhir Singh, who is admittedly a\n\n   resident of Plot No.103, Saket Nagar, Varanasi, Uttar\n\n   Pradesh. He is a politician and a businessman and when he\n\n   was on a trip to Delhi, he was threatened by the\n\n   Respondents due to their business rivalry.                 Several facts\n\n   pertaining to the illegal activities of the Respondents in Uttar\n\n   Pradesh have been mentioned in the FIR.                     Sudhir Singh\n\n   complained of extortion by the Respondents for payment of\n\n   Rs.50 Lakhs as protection money.                  During the course of\n\n   investigation, it was found that the call that was made on the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                             32</span>\n\fCriminal Appeal @SLP(Crl.) No.5497 of 2015\n\n\n\n\n   mobile phone of Sudhir Singh was from a PCO at Varanasi. It\n\n   appears from a close reading of the FIR and the charge sheet\n\n   in FIR No.69 of 2007, that there was no criminal activity\n\n   pertaining to organised crime within the territory of Delhi and\n\n   the complaint was filed by the informant at Delhi only for the\n\n   purpose of invoking MCOCA. We have thoroughly examined\n\n   the material placed on record by the prosecution including\n\n   the charge sheet and found that there is no mention of any\n\n   property belonging to the Respondents in Delhi.                     We gave\n\n   sufficient time to Shri Sidharth Luthra to show us anything\n\n   from the record pertaining to possession of property by the\n\n   Respondents in Delhi.                     After making enquiries with the\n\n   authorities concerned, Mr. Luthra fairly submitted that the\n\n   Respondents are not in possession of any property in Delhi.\n\n   As     there      is    no     organised        crime   committed   by   the\n\n   Respondents within the territory of Delhi, there is no cause of\n\n   action for initiation of proceedings under MCOCA.\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_74\">35.
