Out of the 14 accused, accused  \nA-1, A-2,  A-3, A-7, A-8, A-11, A-12 &amp; A-14 were found guilty \nof offences punishable under Sections 120 B, 342, 365 and \n384 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">IPC</a> and were acquitted of other offences. The other \naccused A-4, A-5, A-6,A-9 and A-10 were not found guilty.  \nAccused   A-13 died during the pendency of the trial.  Criminal \nAppeal No. 1228/2004 has been filed by the accused who have \nbeen convicted by the Special Judge.  Criminal Appeal No. \n129/2005 has been filed by the State alleging that the \nacquittal of the accused-appellants in Criminal Appeal No. \n1228/2004 for certain other offences for which they were \ncharged was not justified. Criminal Appeal No. 130/2005 is \nfiled against the acquittal of accused A-4, A-5, A-6, A-9 &amp; A-10 \nof all the offences charged against them.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">\tThe prosecution case was that the accused persons \nhatched a criminal conspiracy to kidnap PW 7 Vedprakash \nDevkinandan Chidipal and extort a ransom of Rs. 1 crore from \nhim.  One Sherjada (now deceased) called the assistance of   \nA-12 Musakhan @ Babakhan Ismailkhan, A-11 Jahangir \nMahammadanwar Saiyed and A-1 Abdulvahab and together \nthey planned to kidnap PW 7 Chidipal.  The other accused \nnamely, A-2, A-3, A-8 and A-14 were also present. In \npursuance of  their common object, on 22.2.1994 they all went \nto Pirana Road in a Maruti car, a Maruti Van and a Yamaha \nmotorcycle.  PW 7 Chidipal was found going in a Maruti 1000 \ncar and his vehicle was driven by one Sangramsinh.  The \nMaruti car wherein some of the accused-appellants were \ntravelling overtook the Maruti 1000 car driven by \nSangramsinh and made that car to stop.  One of the accused \nopened the door of the Maruti 1000 car near the driver&#x27;s seat, \npushed the driver from his seat and took control of the vehicle.  \nTwo other accused entered the car and sat on either side of \nPW 7 Chidipal.  The car was driven to Octroi-Naka and after \nsometime, driver Sangramsinh was pushed out of the car.   \nPW 7 Chidipal was then moved to a White Maruti van and his \neyes were bandaged with cotton.  He was taken to a room and \nconfined there for two days.  The accused took the telephone \nnumbers of the brothers of PW 7 Chidipal.  PW 11 Jaiprakash, \nbrother of Chidipal was contacted and told that he shall not \ninform the police and a sum of Rs. 1 crore was demanded from \nhim.  Nobody came forward to give money to the accused. On \n24.2.1994, PW 11 Jaiprakash was contacted again and told to \nreach the house of PW 9 Sattar.  PW 11 Jaiprakash and one \nShivbhagwan went to the house of PW 9 Sattar in a white \nMaruti car with four bags.  Again, PW 11 Jaipakash was told \nto go to Anjuman High School at Astodia and was directed to \nleave his Maruti car behind a rickshaw.  They left the Maruti \ncar behind the rickshaw and came back to the house of PW 9 \nSattar Bhai.  At about 10.00 p.m. on that day, PW 7 Chidipal \ncame back to his house.  Sangramsinh the driver of PW 7 \nChidipal went to Vatva Police Station.  He gave a First \nInformation statement to the Police Inspector and investigation \nstarted pursuant to his statement.  The Maruti 1000 car \nowned by PW 7 Chidipal was found parked by the side of the \nroad.  It was recovered under Exh. 182-B Panchnama.  PW 24 \nPolice Inspector searched the house of A-7 Salim \nNoormahammad Haveliwala and recovered a diary which \ncontained the telephone number of Chidipal Textile Mill.   A-9 \nPrakash Shobhnath was arrested on 2.6.1994 and a sum of \nRs. 50,000/- was recovered in the course of investigation and \nthe accused A-1 Abdulvahab, A-3 Najirmahammad Vora, A-5 \nSalauddin Haveliwala, A-6 Mahammadrafik and A-8 \nAbdulsattar were arrested.  The Yamaha motorcycle allegedly \nused by the accused was also recovered.  The first appellant \nproduced Rs. 1,50,000/- before the Investigating Officer.  On \n11.8.1994, the Investigating Officer requested the State to \ninvoke the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_9\">TADA Act</a> against the accused and \na report was sent to the DCP.  PW 27 Shri B.R. Patil was \nentrusted with the task of investigation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_3\">\tA-12 Musakhan @ Babakhan Ismailkhan was arrested by \nPW 27 Shri B.R. Patil and produced before PW 1 Shri Suroliya, \nDCP, Ahmedabad as the accused expressed his willingness to \nmake a confessional statement.  At the instance of PW 1 Shri \nSuroliya DCP, A-12 Musakhan @ Babakhan gave a detailed \nconfessional statement.  The rest of the accused were also \narrested and finally the charge sheet was prepared by the \npolice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">\tThis being the first appeal filed under the provisions of \nthe <a href=\"/doc/17848451/\" id=\"a_10\">TADA Act</a>, we have carefully considered the entire case \nadduced by the prosecution before the Spl. Judge and heard \nthe arguments of the learned Counsel for the accused-\nappellants as well as the learned Counsel for the respondent \nState. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">\tThe learned Counsel for the accused-appellants strongly \nurged before us that the confessional statement given by A-12 \nMusakhan @ Babakhan was not reliable and admissible as it \nwas not voluntarily made.  It was also urged before us that the \nconfession made by a co-accused is extremely fragile and \nfeeble type of evidence and it is not substantive evidence \nunder <a href=\"/doc/1031309/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 3</a> of the Indian Evidence Act and is liable to be \nrejected.  It was also urged by the appellant&#x27;s learned Counsel \nthat the confession of co-accused should not be used against \nthe other accused and it is only to be used as corroborative \npiece of evidence and that the Court must begin with some \nother evidence adduced by prosecution and in any case the \nconfession of a co-accused cannot be the sole ground for \nconviction of the accused. The accused-appellants placed \nreliance on the observations of this Court in Haricharan \nKurmi Vs. State of Bihar  [1964 (6) SCR 623].  It was further \nsubmitted that provisions of <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 15</a> of the TADA Act could \nmake the confession admissible in evidence, but the &#x27;Rule of \nprudence&#x27; would require that such evidence shall be supported \nby other items of evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">\tThe learned Counsel for the appellant also contended \nthat the confession made by A-12 Musakhan @ Babakhan was \nnot voluntary and he was put under serious pressure and on \nthe very next day he had retracted the confession and that by \nitself showed that it was not voluntarily made.  The learned \nCounsel for the appellant also contended that the Magistrate \nwas very much available to record the statement of A-12 \nMusakhan @ Babakhan under Section 164 Cr. PC, but the \nsame was not done and PW 1 Shri Suroliya, DCP recorded the \nconfession and the confession was extracted from him by \nusing extreme pressure tactics.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">\tThe learned Counsel further urged that the fact that the \nconfession was retracted on the very next day is indicative that \nit was not voluntarily made.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_8\">\tWe have carefully considered the arguments advanced by \nthe appellant&#x27;s learned Counsel.  Merely because the \nconfession was retracted, it need not be taken as a confession \nmade under pressure.  The state of mind of the accused at the \ntime of making the confession is the relevant factor.  He was \narrested by the police and as he expressed his willingness to \nmake a confession, he was produced before the DCP and told \nthat he was not legally bound to give a voluntary statement \nand that in case any statement is found to be false, it would be \nused against him. The DCP had taken all precautions to \nascertain that the confession was voluntary.  All formalities \nhad been complied with and these facts are incorporated in \nthe confessional statement.  All confessions are invariably \nretracted at a later stage, therefore, the retraction by itself is \nnot a ground to discard the confession by holding that it was \nnot voluntarily made.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">\tIn the instant case, the confession made by A-12 \nMusakhan @ Babakhan is running into several pages.  He has \ngiven the intricate details of the incident and the manner in \nwhich the crime was executed.  The relevant portion of the \nconfession made by A-12 Musakhan @ Babakhan is as \nfollows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">&quot;\u0005. Before one month of the murder of \nSherjada, on Piplaj-road, outside Pirana Octroi \nCheck-Post, he had abducted one industrialist.  The \ntip was brought by Vijaybapu residing at \nManinagar.  Sherjada called me and Atik at the \nhouse of Vahab, situated in Devi-Park during 2 to \n2.30 P.M.  When we reached there, Shejada, Vahab, \nSalim Chipa, Najir Vora, Sattar Ghanti, Salim Tola, \nAehmad Behro were present, and told that Chidipal \nis a big industrialist and he comes in his 1000 \nvehicle always.  His factory is situated on Piplaj \nroad and it was decided to abduct him.  Therefore, \ntaking the Fronti of Vahab, one Yamaha and \nMaruti-van of Sherjada, we left affixing on it the \nfalse number-plate.  Vijaybapu had given me and \nAtik one revolver Point-38 of Vahab.  Sherjada and \nVahab also had with them their revolvers.  Najir \nVora was sent to keep watch towards the road \nleading to Vishala Hotel.  We all also went.  I, \nVijaybapu and Atik sat in the van of Sherjada and \nSalim Ando was driving it.  Sherjada had put on the \ndress of Shephered.   Aehmad Behra was seated in \nthe Fronti of Vahab and Vahab was driving it.  We \nall stayed near one Electric Sub-Station on the \nroad, leading to Piplaj by going via Pirana, Excise \nPost.  Najir Vora came at 5 p.m. from Vishala Bridge \nand told that the industrialist is coming.  Therefore, \nwe become alert.  After sometime, 1000 of that \nindustrialist came.  Vahab drover Fronti ahead of \nsaid 1000 and Tolo drove the van behind it.  Driving \nthe vehicle upto some distance, Vahab stopped his \nvehicle and therefore, 1000 also stopped.  We all got \ndown from our vehicle and ran and went near 1000.  \nSherjada opened the gate of driver&#x27;s side of the said \n1000 and gave him push and removed him from the \nseat and he himself sat on steering.  Vijaybapu took \nseat on the left-side of the driver.  The industrialist \nwas seated on the back-seat and around him, I and \nAtik sat.  The industrialist and driver were shown \nrevolvers and by giving threats, they were made \nsilent.  Vahab drove the Fronti ahead and Sherjada \ndrove 1000.  Tolo was driving the van.  Crossing \nPirana Excise point, via Suez Farm, we went \ntowards the hospital of infectious-disease.  There \nare trees and there was no movement of anyone.  \nHence, the Vehicles were stopped and the \nindustrialist was taken into the van.  1000 was \ngiven to Vijaybapu and he was told to leave it \nanywhere and come to Devipark.  When he went \naway, we all came to Devipark taking with us said \nindustrialist.  Vahab took away revolvers from \neverybody except Sherjada.  Vijaybapu had come \nafter leaving 1000.  There, Sherjada and Vahab also \nmade a plan to extort money by taking telephone \nnumbers of friends and relatives of industrialist \nChidipal Vedprakash Vahab and Sherjada  went out \nfor doing telephone.  After sometime, they returned \nand told that the work does not complete.  \nSubsequently, for doing telephone, they took \nChidipal to Kankaria, and after getting talk with \nChidipal from his friends and relatives, they \nbrought him back to Devipark and detained him.  \nAfter 3 days, Vahab and Sherjada told me and Atik \nto go in rickshaw at the corner of the street opposite \nAnjuman High School.  There while Maruti Fronti \nwould come and tell to the driver of the said Maruti \nFronti Code-Word pen and he would give you the \nkey.  I and Atik went in rickshaw to Gol-Limda and \nVahab and Sherjada came there on motorcycle.  \nMaruti Fronti had come there.  Saying code-word \nPen to its driver, he gave key to Atik.  Taking the \nsaid Fronti, he went to old Muni quarters situated \nat Gita Mandir and Vahab and Sherjada were \ndriving their Motorcycle behind the said Fronti.  We \nparked the Fronti there.  I and Atik were sent back \nin rickshaw and we were told to come to Devi-park.  \nWhen we reached to Devi-park, at that time, Vahab \ntold Salim Tola to drop the industrialist Chidipal on \nIsanpur Highway.  Tola put the cotton on the eyes of \nChidipal and affixed bandage of medicine on it and \nput Black coloured spacts on that bandage.  On the \nYamaha Motorcycle of Najir Vora, Atik and Tola \ndropped Chidipal at Isanpur.  Subsequently, Atik \ntold me that for the release of Chidipal, Rs. 1 crore \nis received.  Vahab told us that Latif has big share \nin money.  Sherjada was given Rs. 17 lacs.  Atik was \ngiven Rs. 4,00,000/-.  I was given Rs. 2.5 lacs, \nSalim Tola and Vijaybapu each got Rs. 2 lacs, while \nsattar Ghanti and Najir Vora were given Rs. 1 lac \neach and Aehmad Behra was given Rs. 50,000/-.  \nVahab told that the said matter is given by Latif \nfrom Dubai and he has large share.  Rs. 60 lacs are \nsent to Latif by adjustment and deducting Rs. 1 lac \ntowards expenditure, Vahab told that he had \nreceived only Rs. 9 lacs\u0005.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">\tThe confession made by A-12 Musakhan @ Babakhan \ngives an account of the kidnapping of PW 7 Chidipal.  He \nmentions about the participation of other accused in the \ncommission of the crime.  He also mentions that an amount of \nRs. 1 crore was demanded and received and while Latif had \nreceived a big share in the money and Sherjada was given     \nRs. 17 lakhs, he himself received Rs. 2.5 lakhs. In the \nconfession, it is also mentioned as to how the money was \ntransferred to the accused and the places where these \nincidents happened. From other items of evidence, ample \ncorroboration is found of what A-12 Musakhan @ Babakhan \nhad stated in the confession.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">\tThe learned Counsel for the accused-appellants \ncontended that the confession of a co-accused is not a \nsubstantive evidence as against the other accused and even \nthough it is admissible under <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 15</a> of the TADA Act, it \ncannot be used for fixing  criminal liability of other accused.  It \nwas submitted that such confession could only be used as a \ncorroborative piece of evidence and unless there is a primary \nevidence to prove the guilt of the accused, the confession \ncannot be used against them.  In State through \nSuperintendent of Police, CBI/SIT Vs. Nalini and Others \n(1999) 5 SCC 253, this Court held that the confession \nrecorded under <a href=\"/doc/187258181/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 15</a> of the TADA Act is a substantive \npiece of evidence, but as a &#x27;Rule of Prudence&#x27;, it could be \naccepted only when there is corroboration.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">\tThe learned Counsel for the accused-appellants also \ncontended that the confession was not voluntary and, \ntherefore, it is inadmissible in evidence.  It was pointed out \nthat though a Magistrate was readily available to record the \nconfession, A-12 Musakhan @ Babakhan was not produced \nbefore the Magistrate and PW-1 DCP Shri Suroliya recorded \nthe confession without following the procedure.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">  \tWe have perused the records and observed that PW 1 \nDCP Shri Suroliya has followed all procedural formalities \nbefore recording the confession. Merely because the confession \nwas retracted later, when A-12 Musakhan @ Babakhan was \nproduced before the Magistrate, that does not mean that the \nconfession was not voluntary in nature.  Whether the accused \nwas willing to give a confession voluntarily or not is to be \ndetermined from his mental state at the time when he gave the \nconfession.  There is nothing on record to show that A-12 \nMusakhan @ Babakhan was under pressure to give any \nconfession.  When he was produced before the Magistrate, he \nhad no case that he was put under pressure or third-degree \nmethods had been used against him to extract the confession.  \nWhen he was questioned under Section 313 Cr. PC, he had \nonly stated that he had not given any confession as recorded \nby PW-1 DCP Shri Suroliya.  These facts would indicate that \nthe confession was voluntary and was recorded by PW-1 after \napprising him that he was not bound to give a confession and \nin case he gave the confession, it would be used against him.  \nTherefore, we do not find any force in the contention advanced \nby the learned counsel for accused-appellants regarding the \ninadmissibility of the confession.  As stated earlier, there is \nample evidence to show that the confession given by A-12 \nMusakhan @ Babakhan was truthful and gained support from \nother items of evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">  \tPW-7 Chidipal the victim had given evidence that on \n22.2.1994, he went to his factory at about 10.00 a.m. in a \nMaruti 1000 car and later when he came back, he got down at \nMithakhali at the residence of his relative and from there, he \nstarted at 5 o&#x27; clock and when the car reached near Toll Naka, \none vehicle overtook his car and stopped in front of his car.  \nPW-7 Chidipal further deposed that 4-5 persons got down \nfrom that car and one of them got into his car from the driver&#x27;s \nside while another one got into the car from the left front door.  \nYet another person got into the car and the car was driven \ntowards Octroi Post. His eyes were shut with a cotton bandage \nand he was kept in confinement.  On the next day, he was \nasked to give the telephone numbers of his relatives and he \ntalked to his brother. But this witness deposed that he did not \nknow the identity of the kidnappers.  The evidence of PW-11 \nJaiprakash, the brother of PW-7 Chidipal gives further details \nas to how the kidnappers were paid money.  He deposed that \non 22.2.1994 he got a call from the kidnappers and they asked \nhim whether the money was ready.  He further deposed that \nthe kidnappers demanded Rs. 1 crore.  This witness also did \nnot support the prosecution but he admitted that four bags \nwere taken in a car and that car was parked behind a \nrickshaw whereafter they left the place.  This witness would \ndeny having given the bags of money, but his entire evidence \nwould show that kidnappers were paid money.  In the cross-\nexamination,   he admitted that he told the kidnappers that \nRs. 1 crore was ready when they asked him for money over \ntelephone.  From the evidence of PW-11 Jaiprakash, it is clear \nthat Rs. 1 crore was paid as ransom to the kidnappers.  PW-12 \nJyoti Prakash is another brother of PW-7 Chidipal who also \ngave evidence as to how the brothers assembled at his \nresidence and discussed the issue of raising Rs. 1 crore.  He \ncontacted his friends and relatives to make arrangements of \nRs. 1 crore, but this witness also did not fully support the \nprosecution and declined to give evidence regarding the actual \npayment of money.  The evidence of PW-9 Satarbhai Abdul \nRehman is also very important.  He deposed that the victim \nChidipal was known to him and this witness used to do some \ndesigning work for him.  He deposed about the kidnapping of \nPW-7 Chidipal and about his active participation in the \npayment of money to kidnappers.  \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\"> \tFrom  the  evidence  of  these  witnesses, it is clear that \nPW-7 Chidipal was kidnapped and the kidnappers were paid \nransom amount for his release.  The details of the kidnapping, \nthe manner in which it was done and the extortion of money \nare all spoken of by the witnesses. In the confession \nstatement, A-12 Musakhan @ Babakhan has given all these \ndetails and these details are in perfect consonance with the \nevidence given by the witnesses.  But it seems that all these \nwitnesses were afraid of giving the identity of the accused.     \nA-12 in his confession has given the details of participation of \nall the accused persons and has also stated that the money \nwas indeed received and shared by them.  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">\tTaking all these factors into consideration, we do not find \nany difficulty in accepting the confession made by A-12 \nMusakhan @ Babakhan.  The confession given by him cannot \nbe said to be a figment of his imagination, but appears to be a \ntrue account of the events of kidnapping and extortion of \nmoney.  Therefore, we do not find any illegality in the \nconviction as recorded against these accused-appellants.  The \nCriminal Appeal No. 1228/2004 filed by the accused is \nwithout any merits and is liable to be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">\tCriminal Appeal No. 129/2005 and Criminal Appeal       \nNo. 130/2005 are filed by the State against the acquittal of \nsome of the accused and also against the acquittal of some \naccused for certain other offences for which they were \ncharged.  Going by the evidence on record, we do not find any \nmerit in the contentions advanced by the State.  The accused \nhave been convicted only for the offences where there was \nsatisfactory evidence against them. As regards acquittal of \nother accused, we find no merit in the contentions raised by \nthe State.  Accordingly, these appeals are liable to be \ndismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_18\">\tIn the result, all the appeals are without any merits and \nare dismissed.\n</p>","numcites":9,"numcitedby":8,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":363371,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"confession","formInput":"confession"},{"value":"kidnapping","formInput":"kidnapping"},{"value":"extortion","formInput":"extortion"},{"value":"tada act","formInput":"tada%20act"},{"value":"confession of accused","formInput":"confession%20of%20accused"},{"value":"recording of confession ","formInput":"recording%20of%20confession%20"},{"value":"tada sortby: suresh patel","formInput":"tada%20sortby%3A%20suresh%20patel"},{"value":"confessional statements","formInput":"confessional%20statements"},{"value":"retraction","formInput":"retraction"},{"value":"octroi","formInput":"octroi"},{"value":"ransom","formInput":"ransom"},{"value":"Bandages","formInput":"Bandages"},{"value":"maruti","formInput":"maruti"},{"value":"jai prakash","formInput":"jai%20prakash"}],"cats":[{"value":"criminal-conspiracy","formInput":"tag:criminal-conspiracy"},{"value":"indian-penal-code","formInput":"tag:indian-penal-code"},{"value":"interpretation-clause","formInput":"tag:interpretation-clause"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
