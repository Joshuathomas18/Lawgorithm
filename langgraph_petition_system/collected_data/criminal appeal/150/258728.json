There were holidays\n\nafter 22.12.1990 till 26.12.1990, then there was no idea\n\nto withdraw heavy amount on 21.12.1990.               If payment\n\nwas withdrawn on 21.12.1990, then it was very easy to\n\ndisburse the amount amongst the labourers. No request\n\nshould have been made to the police              not to take their\n\nfinger prints. That means, there was something in the\n\nmind of Zile Singh SDC that is why he was not ready to\n\nsupply his finger prints for comparison. Surinder Kumar\n\nSDO was present at the time of recoveries, but his\n\nstatement is also without any evidentiary value because\n\nhe was facing inquiry qua the present occurrence. He did\n\nnot     supply his finger prints. Submission of learned\n\ndefence counsel seems to be reasonable one. Occurrence\n\nwas on the intervening night of 25/26.12.1990. Zile\n\nSingh    had   stayed   in   the   office   on     the   night   of\n\n21/22.12.1990,     but there was not cot or bedding              for\n\nstay in the office when finger prints were lifted from the\n\nspot, then there was no idea not to supply finger prints .\n\nZile Singh SDC and Surinder Kumar SDO were facing\n\ninquiry.     Both seemed to be behind the seen. At the\n\ninstance of Zile Singh SDC and Surinder Kumar SDO,\n     Crl. Appeal No.43-DB of 2000.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">    Crl.

Dilbag\n\nSingh   was not expected to conceal cash       in the chaff\n\nstored in the room owned by some other persons.
