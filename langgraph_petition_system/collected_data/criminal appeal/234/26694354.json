Secondly, he submitted that the proviso to\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/81939/\" id=\"a_10\">section 372</a> does not make any distinction between right to\n       \n\n\n    prefer an appeal against the order of acquittal and the right\n    \n\n\n\n    to prefer an appeal against the order of conviction.                     He\n\n    further submitted that the said proviso also does not limit\n\n\n\n\n\n    the procedure laid down under Chapter XXIX of the Cr.P.C.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"68571\" id=\"span_10\">and, lastly, he submitted that the proviso has to be read as a\n\n\n\n\n\n    substantive provision but so far as procedural part is\n\n    concerned, reliance has to be placed on further procedure\n\n    which has to be followed in case of filing appeals under\n\n    Chapter XXIX.

This, obviously, reflects the\n                        \n    intention of the Parliament that          at the initial stage of\n\n    investigation and prosecution and even at the hearing of the\n       \n\n\n    criminal trial, at the best, the victim can appoint his\n    \n\n\n\n    advocate     only   to   assist   the    Public     Prosecutor.                A\n\n    classification, therefore, has been clearly made by the\n\n\n\n\n\n    Parliament in respect of the right which is to be given to the\n\n    victim at the stage of trial and, at that stage, the Parliament\n\n\n\n\n\n    has reiterated by making amendment to section 24 that only\n\n    assistance can be provided to the Public Prosecutor.                       This\n\n    has been done for obvious reasons. Firstly, the State, as an\n\n    impartial investigator, can investigate into offence and bring\n\n    out the correct position before the Court and the prosecution\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                                                ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 17:45:22 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                       48</span>\n                                            APEAL Nos.991/11, 992/11\n                                            331/11 &amp; 854/11\n\n\n\n\n                                                                    \n    also can ensure that proper material is produced before the\n\n    Court in order to find out the truth in respect of the said\n\n\n\n\n                                            \n    criminal case. However, after taking into consideration the\n\n    existing prevalent position, the Parliament thought it fit to\n\n\n\n\n                                           \n    give some additional rights to the victim for preferring an\n\n    appeal.    It is, therefore, not possible to accept the\n\n\n\n\n                                  \n    observations made by the Gujarat High Court and the\n                       \n    question of sovereign right of the State does not arise since\n                      \n    it is controlled by the provisions which are made by the\n\n    Parliament pursuant to the power which is given to it under\n       \n\n\n    Concurrent List of Schedule-VII to the Constitution of India.\n</p>    \n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1940266\" id=\"span_112\">Secondly, what is not considered by the Division Bench\n\n\n\n\n\n    of the Gujarat High Court in the said case is that refusal to\n\n    grant leave by the High Court for filing an appeal against the\n\n\n\n\n\n    order of acquittal does not amount to merger of the order of\n\n    the High Court refusing leave with the Order of the Trial\n\n    Court.

No doubt, if the\n\n    plain language of a provision in the statute lends to\n\n\n\n\n\n    contradiction or absurdity then courts, in such cases, would\n\n    frown upon literal rule of interpretation.         However, in the\n\n    instant   case,    no    such    absurdity,     or       anomaly            or\n\n    incompatibility can be noticed which is apparent on the plain\n\n    reading of section 372.

We may take yet another example.

The absurdity of such a consequence is obvious and does not \n    \n\n\n\n    require any further elucidation, but such a consequence is inevitable if \n\n    the view against requirement of leave is to be accepted. It would be \n\n\n\n\n\n    relevant in this context that under sub-section (6) of Section 378, a \n\n    case where an application for leave made by a private complainant is \n\n\n\n\n\n    rejected by refusing leave, no Appeal <a href=\"/doc/1456458/\" id=\"a_87\">in that case</a> from the order of \n\n    acquittal shall lie under sub-section (i) or sub-section (ii) thereof.
