Learned  senior  counsel  appearing  for  the\nappellant pointed out that with a non obstante clause, <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 142</a>  provides\nthat only two categories of persons, namely, the payee or the holder in  due\ncourse of the cheque is entitled to file a complaint under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_46\">Section  138</a>  of\nthe N.I. Act.  According to learned senior counsel  for  the  appellant,  in\nthe first case, the verification statement of solemn  affirmation  has  been\nmade by the constituted attorney and not by the complainant.  It is  further\npointed  out  that  the  verification  affidavit  made  by  the  constituted\nattorney is not on the basis of her personal knowledge and hence,  it  would\nsquarely fall within the ambit of hearsay evidence and  cannot  be  read  in\nevidence in a court of law.   By  pointing  out  the  same,  learned  senior\ncounsel for  the  appellant  submitted  that  the  constituted  attorney  is\nincompetent to depose on  behalf  of  the  complainants.   In  other  words,\naccording to the appellant, the Power of Attorney holder  is  not  competent\nto depose about the transaction that took place between the  payee  and  the\ndrawer of the cheque.  Learned senior counsel also pointed out that  <a href=\"/doc/212404/\" id=\"a_47\">Section\n2</a>  of  the  Power  of  Attorney  Act,  1882  cannot  override  the  specific\nprovisions of the Statute which require that  a  particular  act  should  be\ndone in a particular manner (vide <a href=\"/doc/549957/\" id=\"a_48\">Nazir Ahmed vs. King Emperor</a>, <a href=\"/doc/749759/\" id=\"a_49\">AIR 1936  PC\n253, Rao Bahasur Ravula Subba Rao &amp; Ors. vs.  Commissioner  of  Income  Tax</a>,\nAIR 1956 SC 604 at 612-613).</span></span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"642070\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"749759\" id=\"span_16\">It  was  further  pointed  by  learned  senior\ncounsel for the appellant that the decision in <a href=\"/doc/749759/\" id=\"a_50\">Rao Bahasur Ravula Subba  Rao</a>\n(supra) was followed in <a href=\"/doc/642070/\" id=\"a_51\">Jimmy Jahangir Madan  vs.  Bolly  Cariyappa  Hindley</a>\n(dead) by LRs, (2004) 12 SCC 509.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"553344\" id=\"span_17\">9)    In view of the above, learned senior counsel for the appellant  relied\non a decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/553344/\" id=\"a_52\">Janki Vashdeo Bhojwani</a> (supra)  wherein  this\nCourt held that Power of Attorney cannot depose for the  acts  done  by  the\nprincipal.  Likewise,  it  was  further  held  that  he  cannot  depose  for\nprincipal in respect of  matters  of  which  only  the  principal  can  have\npersonal knowledge and in respect of which the principal  is  liable  to  be\ncross-examined.  It was further held that the Power of Attorney  can  appear\nonly as a witness in  respect  of  facts,  which  are  within  his  personal\nknowledge.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">10)   In the case on hand, it is pointed out by learned senior  counsel  for\nthe appellant that the constituted attorney did not even file the  Power  of\nAttorney along with the complaint or with the  verifying  statement  and  in\nview of the same, the Magistrate could not have issued process on the  basis\nof such a complaint.  No doubt, it is true that the Power  of  Attorney  was\nproduced along with the reply to the application for discharge filed by  the\ncomplainant after two years of the order  passed  by  the  Additional  Chief\nMetropolitan Magistrate issuing summons.   In  other  words,  the  Power  of\nAttorney holder is at best a witness  to  the  execution  of  the  Power  of\nAttorney and not to the contents of the complaint.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">11)   Learned senior counsel for the appellant also  pointed  out  that  the\nprovision under Section 200 of the Code is mandatory and obligatory  on  the\npart of the Magistrate to examine the complainant.  However,  a  perusal  of\nthe Section makes it clear that examination of witnesses  present,  if  any,\nis optional.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">12)   Learned senior counsel for the appellant further  contended  that  the\nobject of such examination is to ascertain whether there is  a  prima  facie\ncase against the accused of the commission of an  offence  as  mentioned  in\nthe complaint and also to prevent the issuance of a process on  a  complaint\nwhich is either false or vexatious or intended to harass a person.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_27\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"106681665\" id=\"span_18\">13)   Learned  senior  counsel  for  the  appellant  further  contended,  by\ndrawing our attention to the language of Section 200 of the Code,  that  the\nMagistrate taking cognizance of an offence on complaint shall  examine  upon\noath the complainant.

The  appellant-Company  and  the\nrespondent-Company entered into a Memorandum of  Understanding  (MoU)  dated\n01.06.1994 and the same was slightly altered  on  19.09.1994.   Pursuant  to\nthe MoU, two cheques were issued by the respondent-Company in favour of  the\nappellant-Company. When both the cheques were  presented  for  payment,  the\nsame got returned with an  endorsement  “payment  stopped  by  drawer”.  Two\nnotices were served by the appellant-Company on the  respondent-Company.  As\nthe amounts under the cheques were not paid,  the  appellant-Company  lodged\ntwo complaints through one  Lakshman  Goel,  the  Manager  of  the  Regional\nOffice (RO) of the appellant-Company.  Respondents therein  also  filed  two\npetitions for quashing of the complaints. By the impugned  order,  both  the\ncomplaints were quashed.  In the said case as well as  in  the  cases  filed\nsubsequently, the respondents took identical contentions in their  petitions\nin order to quash the complaints, viz., that  the  complaints  filed  by  Mr\nLakshman Goel were not maintainable and that the cheques were not given  for\nany debt or liability.  In the impugned  judgment,  it  was  held  that  the\ncomplaints filed by Mr Lakshman Goel were not maintainable. The  High  Court\nheld that it is only an Executive  Director  of  the  Company  who  has  the\nauthority to institute legal proceedings.  While holding that the  reasoning\ngiven by the High Court cannot be sustained, this Court  held  that  <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_59\">Section\n142</a> of the N.I. Act provides that a complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 138</a> can be  made\nby the payee or the holder in due course of the  said  cheque.   This  Court\nfurther held that the complaints in question were by  the  appellant-company\nwho is the payee of the two cheques.  After finding that  the  Court  cannot\nquash a complaint as stated by the High Court,  this  Court  set  aside  the\nsame and directed the trial Court to proceed  with  the  complaints  against\nRespondent Nos. 1 and 3 therein in accordance with law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"553344\" id=\"span_19\">18)   Now, let us consider  the  later  decision  of  this  Court  in  <a href=\"/doc/553344/\" id=\"a_61\">Janki\nVashdeo Bhojwani</a> (supra).  This case relates to powers of Power of  Attorney\nunder <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_62\">the Code of  Civil  Procedure</a>,  1908  and  it  was  concluded  that  a\ncomplaint by a power of attorney holder on behalf of original  plaintiff  is\nmaintainable provided he  has  personal  knowledge  of  the  transaction  in\nquestion.

The question whether  the\n      appellants have any independent source of income and have  contributed\n      towards the purchase of the property from their own independent income\n      can be only answered by the appellants themselves and not  by  a  mere\n      holder of power of attorney from them.  The  power-of-attorney  holder\n      does not have personal knowledge of the matter of the  appellants  and\n      therefore he can neither depose on his personal knowledge nor  can  he\n      be cross-examined on those facts which are to the  personal  knowledge\n      of the principal.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">      13.

In  our  view  the  word  “acts”\n      employed in Order 3 Rules 1 and 2 <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_65\">CPC</a> confines only to in  respect  of\n      “acts” done by the  power-of-attorney  holder  in  exercise  of  power\n      granted by the instrument.

The view taken in the case of Floriano\n      Armando Luis cannot be said to have laid down a  correct  law  and  is\n      accordingly overruled.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"553344\" id=\"span_25\">19)    As  noticed  hereinabove,  though  <a href=\"/doc/553344/\" id=\"a_77\">Janki  Vashdeo  Bhojwani</a>  (supra),\nrelates to powers  of  Power  of  Attorney  holder  under  <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_78\">CPC</a>  but  it  was\nconcluded therein that a plaint by a Power of Attorney holder on  behalf  of\nthe original plaintiff is maintainable provided he  has  personal  knowledge\nof the transaction in question.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"571081\" id=\"span_26\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"281882\" id=\"span_27\">In a way, it is  an  exception  to  a  well\nsettled position that criminal law can be put  in  motion  by  anyone  [vide\n<a href=\"/doc/281882/\" id=\"a_79\">Vishwa Mitter</a>  (supra)] and under the Statute, one stranger  to  transaction\nin question, namely, legal heir etc., can also  carry  forward  the  pending\ncriminal  complaint  or  initiate  the  criminal  action  if  the   original\ncomplainant dies [<a href=\"/doc/571081/\" id=\"a_80\">Vide Ashwin Nanubhai Vyas vs. State of Maharashtra</a>  (1967)\n1 SCR 807].  Keeping in mind various situations like inability as  a  result\nof sickness, old age or death or staying abroad of the payee  or  holder  in\ndue course to appear and depose before the  Court  in  order  to  prove  the\ncomplaint, it is permissible for the Power of Attorney  holder  or  for  the\nlegal representative(s)  to  file  a  complaint  and/or  continue  with  the\npending criminal complaint for and on behalf  of  payee  or  holder  in  due\ncourse.  However, it is expected that  such  power  of  attorney  holder  or\nlegal representative(s) should  have  knowledge  about  the  transaction  in\nquestion  so  as  to  able  to  bring   on   record   the   truth   of   the\ngrievance/offence, otherwise, no criminal justice could be achieved in  case\npayee or holder in due course, is  unable  to  sign,  appear  or  depose  as\ncomplainant due to above quoted reasons.</span></span>  Keeping these aspects in mind,  in\nMMTC (supra), this Court had taken the view that if complaint is  filed  for\nand on behalf of payee  or  holder  in  due  course,  that  is  good  enough\ncompliance with <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 142</a> of N.I. Act.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_33\">20)   The stand of the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 73 of 2007  is  that\nno complaint can be filed and no cognizance of the complaint  can  be  taken\nif the complaint is by the power of attorney holder,  since  it  is  against\nSection 200 of the Code and deserves to be rejected.  There  is  no  dispute\nthat complaint has to  be  filed  by  the  complainant  as  contemplated  by\nSection 200 of the Code, but the said Section does not  create  any  embargo\nthat  the  attorney  holder  or  legal   representative(s)   cannot   be   a\ncomplainant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">21)   The power of attorney holder is the agent of the  grantor.   When  the\ngrantor authorizes the attorney holder to  initiate  legal  proceedings  and\nthe attorney holder accordingly initiates such legal  proceedings,  he  does\nso as the agent of  the  grantor  and  the  initiation  is  by  the  grantor\nrepresented by his attorney holder and not by the  attorney  holder  in  his\npersonal capacity.  Therefore, where the payee  is  a  proprietary  concern,\nthe complaint can be filed by the proprietor  of  the  proprietary  concern,\ndescribing himself as the sole proprietor  of  the  payee,  the  proprietary\nconcern, describing itself as a sole  proprietary  concern,  represented  by\nits  sole  proprietor,  and  the  proprietor  or  the  proprietary   concern\nrepresented by the attorney holder under a power  of  attorney  executed  by\nthe sole proprietor.  However, we make it clear that the power  of  attorney\nholder  cannot  file  a  complaint  in  his  own  name  as  if  he  was  the\ncomplainant. In other words, he can initiate criminal proceedings on  behalf\nof the principal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">22)   From a conjoint reading of <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_82\">Sections 138</a>, <a href=\"/doc/595945/\" id=\"a_83\">142</a> and <a href=\"/doc/138755618/\" id=\"a_84\">145</a> of the  N.I.  Act\nas well as Section 200 of the Code, it is clear  that  it  is  open  to  the\nMagistrate to issue process on the basis of the contents of  the  complaint,\ndocuments in support thereof and the affidavit submitted by the  complainant\nin support of the complaint.  Once the complainant  files  an  affidavit  in\nsupport of the complaint before issuance of the process  under  Section  200\nof the Code, it is thereafter open to the Magistrate, if he thinks  fit,  to\ncall upon the complainant to remain present and to examine  him  as  to  the\nfacts contained in the affidavit submitted by the complainant in support  of\nhis complaint.  However, it is a matter of discretion and the Magistrate  is\nnot bound to call upon the complainant to remain present  before  the  Court\nand to examine him upon oath for taking decision whether  or  not  to  issue\nprocess on the complaint under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_85\">Section  138</a>  of  the  N.I.  Act.   For  the\npurpose of issuing process under Section 200 of the Code, it is open to  the\nMagistrate to rely upon the verification in the form of affidavit  filed  by\nthe complainant in support of the complaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 138</a>  of  the  N.I.\nAct. It  is  only  if  and  where  the  Magistrate,  after  considering  the\ncomplaint under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_87\">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act, documents produced  in  support\nthereof and the verification in the form of affidavit  of  the  complainant,\nis of the view that examination of the  complainant  or  his  witness(s)  is\nrequired, the Magistrate may call upon the  complainant  to  remain  present\nbefore the Court and examine the complainant and/or his  witness  upon  oath\nfor taking a decision whether or not  to  issue  process  on  the  complaint\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 138</a> of the N.I. Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">23)   In the light of the discussion, we are of the view that the  power  of\nattorney holder may be allowed to file, appear and depose  for  the  purpose\nof issue of process for the offence punishable  under  <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_89\">Section  138</a>  of  the\nN.I. Act. An exception to the above is when the power of attorney holder  of\nthe complainant does not have a personal knowledge  about  the  transactions\nthen he cannot be examined.  However,  where  the  attorney  holder  of  the\ncomplainant is in charge of the business of the  complainant-payee  and  the\nattorney holder alone is personally aware of the transactions, there  is  no\nreason why the attorney holder cannot depose as  a  witness.   Nevertheless,\nan explicit assertion as to the knowledge of the Power  of  Attorney  holder\nabout the transaction in question must be specified  in  the  complaint.  On\nthis count, the fourth question becomes infructuous.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">24)   In view of the discussion, we are of the  opinion  that  the  attorney\nholder  cannot  file  a  complaint  in  his  own  name  as  if  he  was  the\ncomplainant, but he can initiate  criminal  proceedings  on  behalf  of  his\nprincipal.   We also  reiterate  that  where  the  payee  is  a  proprietary\nconcern,  the  complaint  can  be  filed  (i)  by  the  proprietor  of   the\nproprietary concern, describing  himself  as  the  sole  proprietor  of  the\n“payee”;  (ii)  the  proprietary  concern,  describing  itself  as  a   sole\nproprietary concern, represented by  its  sole  proprietor;  and  (iii)  the\nproprietor or the proprietary concern represented  by  the  attorney  holder\nunder a power of attorney executed by the sole proprietor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">25)   Similar substantial questions were raised in the  appeal  arising  out\nof S.L.P (Crl.) No. 2724 of 2008, which stand answered as above. Apart  from\nthe above questions, one distinct query was raised as to  whether  a  person\nauthorized by a Company or Statute or Institution  can  delegate  powers  to\ntheir subordinate/others for filing a criminal complaint? The  issue  raised\nis in reference to validity of sub-delegation of functions of the  power  of\nattorney. We have already clarified to the extent that the  attorney  holder\ncan sign and file a complaint on behalf of the  complainant-payee.  However,\nwhether the power  of  attorney  holder  will  have  the  power  to  further\ndelegate the functions to another  person  will  completely  depend  on  the\nterms of the general power of attorney. As a result, the authority  to  sub-\ndelegate the functions must be explicitly mentioned in the general power  of\nattorney. Otherwise,  the  sub-delegation  will  be  inconsistent  with  the\ngeneral power of attorney and thereby will be invalid in law.  Nevertheless,\nthe general power of attorney itself  can  be  cancelled  and  be  given  to\nanother person.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"553344\" id=\"span_28\">26)   While holding that there is no serious conflict between the  decisions\nin MMTC (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/553344/\" id=\"a_90\">Janki Vashdeo Bhojwani</a> (supra), we clarify the  position\nand answer the questions in the following manner:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">(i)   Filing of complaint petition under <a href=\"/doc/1823824/\" id=\"a_91\">Section  138</a>  of  N.I  Act  through\npower of attorney is perfectly legal and competent.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">(ii)  The Power of Attorney holder can depose and verify on oath before  the\nCourt in order to prove the contents of the complaint.
