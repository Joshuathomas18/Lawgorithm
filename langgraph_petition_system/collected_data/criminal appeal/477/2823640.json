Both\n             the complainants were deputed to ascertain\n             presence of the appellant in the house.

To bring home the charges, the prosecution examined as\nmany as 11 witnesses in the first case and 13 witnesses in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> .                               8</span>\n\n                                    Criminal Appeal Nos.475/2000 &amp; 478/2000\n\n\n\n\nsecond case. No evidence was led in defence. Upon\nconsideration of the entire evidence brought on record, learned\ntrial Judge, for the reasons recorded in the impugned\njudgments, proceeded to convict the appellant for the offences\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/324254/\" id=\"a_8\">Sections 7</a> and <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_9\">13(1)(d)(i)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1259316/\" id=\"a_10\">Section\n13(2)</a> of the 1988 Act, (which came into existence with effect\nfrom September 09, 1988, i.e. more than a year after the\nincident   in question)   and   sentenced       him     as    indicated\nhereinabove.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">7.   Legality and propriety of the convictions have been\nchallenged on the ground of what has been termed as mis-\nappreciation of the evidence on record.

Before proceeding further, it may be observed that no\nserious dispute was raised as to the facts up to the stage of\nsending of the complainants&#x27; copying applications (Ex.P-10/1\nand 10/2), to the appellant. Against this backdrop, the\nprosecution evidence may be re-appreciated, in the light of the\nrival contentions, under the following sub-heads.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">EVIDENCE OF THE COMPLAINANTS -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">9.   Even though the complainants Rajaram (PW8/1 and\nPW10/2) and Mukundi (PW9/2) reiterated the allegations\ncontained in the applications (Ex.P2/1 and Ex.P9/2) before the\nInspector on 24/7/1987, yet their evidence suffered from the\nunder-mentioned contradictions and infirmities with reference to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\"> .                                9</span>\n\n                                     Criminal Appeal Nos.475/2000 &amp; 478/2000\n\n\n\n\nthe contents of post-trap panchnama (Exhibited in original as\nEx.P/4 in the first case) -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_30\">      (i)     According to Rajaram, he had made the complaint\n              nearly 5 or 6 days after the filing of copying\n              application and as per statement of Mukundi, he\n              had preferred the complaint 4 days after the\n              presentation of the copying application, whereas, as\n              indicated already in both the cases, the complaints\n              leading to trap were made on 24/7/1987 only 2 days\n              after the date of presentation of the copying\n              application.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">      (ii)    The assertion made by both the complainants that\n              the appellant initially demanded a sum of Rs.200/-\n              from each one of them as illegal gratification but\n              reduced the amount to Rs.100/- and Rs.50/-\n              respectively did not find place in the respective\n              complaints.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_32\">      (iii)   Mukundi categorically stated that the appellant had\n              kept the currency notes given by him in pocket of\n              Jacket whereas as per the prosecution version his\n              notes were recovered from a black bag. In his\n              cross-examination, he further revealed that in\n              response to the corresponding query, the appellant\n              had handed over the bribe amounts to the members\n              of the trap party after taking out the same from\n              pockets of his shirt and jacket, which were found\n              hanging on a peg. Rajaram on being examined as\n              PW8 in the first case on 18/10/1997 did not say a\n              word about the black bag. As per his version, the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> .                              10</span>\n\n                                     Criminal Appeal Nos.475/2000 &amp; 478/2000\n\n\n\n\n           bribe money given by Mukundi was also found in\n           the same pocket of the appellant&#x27;s shirt wherefrom\n           the currency notes handed over by him were\n           recovered. However, in his subsequent deposition\n           recorded on 23/3/1998 he, as PW10 in the second\n           case, made an improvement by stating that the\n           appellant had kept the tainted money given by\n           Mukundi in a black bag.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">    (iv)   In the first case, Rajaram asserted that Mukundi\n           had not accompanied him from Circuit House to\n           Kundeshwar. As per his version, after getting down\n           from the jeep at Kundeshwar, he had gone all-alone\n           to the residence of the appellant and had not seen\n           Mukundi there.      However, in the subsequent\n           statement recorded in the second case, he made\n           improvements to bring his evidence in line with the\n           prosecution version. Accordingly, he came forward\n           to state that -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">           (a)the Vigilance Squad had also taken Mukundi\n              along    with   him    from      Circuit      House        to\n              Kundeshwar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">           (b) in his presence only, Mukundi had passed on\n\n              tainted currency notes worth Rs.50/- to the\n              appellant who, in turn, had kept the same in a\n              black bag.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">    (v)    According to Mukundi, he had given money in\n           presence of two or three persons belonging to\n           Yadav caste who were sitting in the Atari and not in\n           presence of Rajaram who was found standing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\"> .                               11</span>\n\n                                      Criminal Appeal Nos.475/2000 &amp; 478/2000\n\n\n\n\n            outside the room. He further deposed that he did\n            not give any signal but had personally informed\n            Inspector H.R.P. Choudhary about passing of the\n            bribe money.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"994976\" id=\"span_10\">10.   Moreover, as admitted by the copyist namely Hazmatullah\nBeg (PW4 in both the cases), none of the complainants was\nrequired to contact the appellant for preparation or supply of the\ncopies applied for as the same were to be delivered in the\nCopying Section of Tahsil only. In such a situation, where the\nprosecution has failed to prove the circumstances necessitating\nthe appellant to demand the bribe, statements of the\ncomplainants were not worthy of acceptance (See. <a href=\"/doc/994976/\" id=\"a_11\">Jagdish\nChandra Makhija v. State of M.P.</a> 1990 MPLJ 239).</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_38\">EVIDENCE OF THE PANCH WITNESSES -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">11.   Statements of panch witnesses namely R.B. Prajapati\n(PW3 in both the cases) and D.C. Patel (PW7/1 and PW2/2)\nwere also not in conformity with the corresponding contents of\npost trap Panchnama. R.B. Prajapati did not corroborate the\nversion that it was he who had taken out the bribe money given\nby Mukundi from the black bag kept by the appellant. As per his\nstatement, he was not able to remember as to whether the\ntainted currency notes allegedly handed over by Rajaram were\nrecovered from the pocket of appellant&#x27;s shirt or from the bag.\nHowever, he categorically admitted that he had no occasion to\ntouch the tainted money passed on by any one of the\ncomplainants to the appellant.       D.C. Patel, the other Panch\nwitness, also did not support the corresponding recital of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\"> .                               12</span>\n\n                                     Criminal Appeal Nos.475/2000 &amp; 478/2000\n\n\n\n\nPanchnama suggesting that it was he who had taken out the\nbribe money given by Rajaram from the appellant&#x27;s shirt pocket.\nIn his statement as PW2/2 recorded on 8/10/1993, he clearly\nasserted that the currency notes said to have been handed\nover by the complainants to the appellant were taken out from\nthe shirt and the bag by M.K. Gautam (PW10/1 and PW12/2)\nwhereas in his subsequent deposition recorded on 8/12/1994 in\nthe first case, he, as PW7/1, disclosed that one of the members\nof the trap party had taken out the bribe money from the Jacket\npocket of the appellant whereas the other member had\nextracted the other set of currency notes from the pocket of\nappellant&#x27;s Kurta that was found hanging on a peg. In none of\nthese statements, he corroborated the fact that he was also\nmade to wash his hands with the sodium carbonate solution as\nhe also had the occasion to touch the tainted money allegedly\npassed on by Rajaram to the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1574068\" id=\"span_12\">12.   In the light of these material inconsistencies, the evidence\nof panch witnesses also did not inspire confidence. Further, as\nthese witnesses were not declared hostile; their evidence was\nbinding on the prosecution (See. <a href=\"/doc/1574068/\" id=\"a_12\">Mukhtiar Ahmed Ansari v.\nState (N.C.T. of Delhi</a>) AIR 2005 SC 2804). Thus, contradictory\nversions given by the panch witnesses also rendered the\nprosecution case doubtful.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">EVIDENCE OF THE OFFICER LEADING THE RAIDING\nPARTY AND OTHER MEMBERS THEREOF -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"292978\" id=\"span_13\">13.   The complainants as well as the panch witnesses further\nadmitted that the detecting officer had not asked them to give\ntheir personnel search before entering into the Atari. This\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> .                              13</span>\n\n                                     Criminal Appeal Nos.475/2000 &amp; 478/2000\n\n\n\n\nadmission assumes significance in view of the assertion made\nby H.R.P. Choudhary (PW9/1 and PW11/2) that Rajaram&#x27;s\ncurrency notes were recovered from pocket of his shirt hanging\non a peg whereas Mukundi&#x27;s money was found in a black bag\nlying near the appellant who, on the date of the incident, was\naged about 57 years. The fact that the appellant might have lost\nhis agility could not be lost sight of. In the peculiar\ncircumstances indicated above, the notes could have been\ninserted in the shirt pocket or placed in the bag without the\nconsent or even knowledge of the appellant (<a href=\"/doc/292978/\" id=\"a_13\">Salimkhan\nSardarkhan v. State of Gujarat</a> AIR 1986 SC 307 relied on).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">14.   Inspector H.R.P. Choudhary was not able to explain as to\nwhy both the complaints were not forwarded by way of a single\nletter to the D.S.P. despite the fact that they were submitted on\nthe same day within a short interval of 1½ hours and only one\npolice personnel viz. Constable Purushottam (PW6/1 and\nPW8/2) was employed for taking the same to Sagar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">15.   Inspector M.K. Gautam (PW10/1 and PW12/2), Head\nConstable    Indramani   Mishra     (PW2/1      and      PW1/2)       and\nConstable Purushottam (PW6/1 and PW8/2) substantiated the\nfacts as stated by Inspector H.R.P. Choudhary that -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">      (i)        he had sent both the complaints (Ex.P-2/1 and\n                 P-9/2) along with letters of request (Ex.P-15 in\n                 both the cases) through Purushottam to the\n                 Dy. S.P., SPE (Lokayukt), Sagar.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">      (ii)       DSP, while authorizing him to lay the trap, had\n                 deputed raiding party comprising of M.K.\n                 Gautam, Inspector S.P. Shukla, Indramani\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> .                              14</span>\n\n                                       Criminal Appeal Nos.475/2000 &amp; 478/2000\n\n\n\n\n                   Mishra, Purushottam and constable Dwarka to\n                   render necessary assistance.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">16.   Nevertheless,    DSP    Jatav,      who      had     granted       the\npermission to conduct the trap, was not examined. Moreover,\nno documentary evidence either in the form of an entry in the\nRoznamcha of the office of SPE (Lokayukt) at Sagar or in any\nother register was tendered to corroborate the corresponding\nstatements    of    M.K.    Gautam,      Indramani         Mishra       and\nPurushottam. It is relevant to note that none of the complaints\nbore signatures of the DSP. Above all, Mukundi, while asserting\nthat he had stayed at the circuit house during the previous night\nonly completely belied the statements of members of the trap\nparty that he had arrived at the time when they were about to\nstart for Kundeshwar after completion of usual pre-trap\nformalities pertaining to complaint made by Rajaram.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1135350\" id=\"span_16\">17.   Moreover, the trap was also conducted in an unusual\nmanner. A trap proceeding envisages secrecy and not a wide\npublicity (<a href=\"/doc/1135350/\" id=\"a_14\">V. Venkata Subbarao v. State</a> (2006) 13 SCC 305\nreferred to). Accordingly, involvement of two complainants in a\ncontemporaneous raid was sufficient to make legality of the\nproceedings questionable.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"873640\" id=\"span_17\">18.   Furthermore,    the   complainants        as    well     as    panch\nwitnesses candidly admitted that the detecting officer had not\nobserved the formalities of their personal search before\nentering the Atari. Search of the members of the search party,\nthough not contemplated in the section, is done in practice so\nthat there may not be suspicion as to plantation of the\nincriminating article (See. <a href=\"/doc/873640/\" id=\"a_15\">State of Bihar v. Kapil Singh</a> AIR\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> .                                15</span>\n\n                                        Criminal Appeal Nos.475/2000 &amp; 478/2000\n\n\n\n\n1969 SC 53).</span> Non-observance of this formality assumed\nsignificance in view of the fact that bribe money was also not\nrecovered from the person of the appellant (Meena Balwant\nHemke v. State of Maharashtra AIR 2000 SC 3377 followed).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"391672\" id=\"span_19\">19.   To sum up, on one hand, the incriminating evidence of\nthe complainants and the Panch witnesses suffered from\nserious infirmities and on the other, veracity of the trap\nproceedings was also questionable in the light of the\nsurrounding circumstances (See. <a href=\"/doc/391672/\" id=\"a_16\">State of T.N. v. Krishnan</a>\n(2002) 9 SCC 521).</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"976925\" id=\"span_20\">In such a situation, the appellant was\nentitled to benefit of doubt (<a href=\"/doc/976925/\" id=\"a_17\">Jai Ram Lakhe v. State of Punjab</a>\n(1978) 3 SCC 133 relied on).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"645156\" id=\"span_21\">20.   Since it could not be established beyond a reasonable\ndoubt that the appellant had obtained or accepted any illegal\ngratification pursuant to demand made by him by abusing his\nposition as a public servant, the presumption under <a href=\"/doc/180243/\" id=\"a_18\">Section\n4(1)</a> of the Act of 1947 could not be drawn in any case (<a href=\"/doc/645156/\" id=\"a_19\">Sita\nRam v. State of Rajasthan</a> (1975) 2 SCC 227 followed). As\nsuch, learned trial Judge completely misdirected himself in\nholding the appellant guilty of the offences under the Act.</span>\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">21.
