The High Court by its judgment and order presently\n\n         under appeal, affirmed the view taken by the Trial Court and upheld\n\n         the death sentence and other sentences imposed by the Trial Court. It\n\n         was observed by the High Court as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">              “8. ……. The victim was, thus, last seen alive with the\n              accused by Kirti Bai whose evidence discloses that\n              the victim and accused were seen together at the point\n              of time in proximity with the time and date of the\n              commission of crime. Also after the incident no one\n              saw the accused alone because he had absconded. We\n              are, therefore, of the view that the prosecution has\n              successfully established the last seen theory beyond\n              any reasonable doubt against the accused.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">              9. We also find that the report, Ex.58, of the DNA\n              Finger Printing Unit completely connects the accused\n              with the commission of crime. The report clearly\n              states that the hairs seized from the fist of victim and\n              the skin found in the cut-nails of victim belonged to\n              the accused. The report further states that the semen\n              found on the paijama of victim was of the accused.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_57\">              Not only this, according to the report, blood found on\n              the underwear of accused was of the victim. The\n              cremation of the body of victim was done on 1.2.2013\n              whereas the accused was arrested on 4.2.2013. There\n              was, therefore, no possibility of the blood of victim\n              having been put on the seized underwear of the\n              accused.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">                                  …     …     …\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">              11. The evidence on record clearly establishes that\n              the accused was close to the family of Ramlal and the\n              victim trusted him. She, therefore, on his asking\n              immediately rushed to buy “bidi” for him from a\n              kirana shop. The accused then followed the victim\n\fCriminal Appeal Nos.62-63 of 2014\nAnokhilal v.

The\n               accused, taking advantage of the trust of victim, after\n               kidnapping and subjecting her to brutal rape and\n               carnal sex most gruesomely throttled her to death. The\n               numerous injuries on the body of victim testify this\n               fact. He even dumped the body of victim in the field.\n               Earlier also, the accused was convicted vide judgment\n               dated 21.10.2010, Ex.49, for committing carnal sex\n               with a small boy. Thus, an innocent hapless girl of\n               nine years was subjected to a barbaric treatment\n               showing extreme depravity and arouses a sense of\n               revulsion in the mind of a common man. We feel that\n               the crime committed satisfies the test of “rarest of\n               rare” cases. We, therefore, uphold the death sentence\n               and also other sentences imposed by the trial court.”\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">     3.

The order-sheet maintained by the Judge\n               seems to indicate that, as soon as the counsel was\n               appointed, the charge was read out to the accused and,\n               after his plea had been recorded, examination of\n               witnesses began. The counsel, of course, did his best\n               to cross-examine the witnesses to the extent it was\n               possible for him to do in the very short time available\n               to him. It is true that the record also does not contain\n               any note that the counsel asked for more time to\n               prepare the defence, but that, in our opinion, is\n               immaterial. The Rule casts a duty on the court itself to\n               grant sufficient time to the counsel for this purpose\n               and the record should show that the Rule was\n               complied with by granting him time which the court\n               considered sufficient in the particular circumstances\n               of the case. In this case, the record seems to show that\n               the trial was proceeded with immediately after\n               appointing the amicus curiae counsel and that, in fact,\n               if any time at all was granted, it was nominal.

In that case,\n                  it was noted that the Judicial Magistrate did not\n                  provide legal representation to the accused persons\n                  because they did not ask for it. This was found to be\n                  unacceptable. This Court went further and held that it\n                  was the obligation of the Judicial Magistrate before\n                  whom the accused were produced to inform them of\n                  their entitlement to legal representation at State cost.\n                  In this context, it was observed that the right to free\n                  legal services would be illusory unless the Magistrate\n                  or the Sessions Judge before whom the accused is\n                  produced informs him of this right. It would also\n                  make a mockery of legal aid if it were to be left to a\n                  poor, ignorant and illiterate accused to ask for free\n                  legal services thereby rendering the constitutional\n                  mandate a mere paper promise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"765136\" id=\"span_37\">15. <a href=\"/doc/765136/\" id=\"a_87\">Suk Das v.

It was observed that: (SCC p. 632, para 6)\n\n                   “6. … There may be cases involving offences\n                   such as economic offences or offences against\n                   law prohibiting prostitution or child abuse and\n                   the like, where social justice may require that\n                   free legal services need not be provided by the\n                   State.”\n\n               We have some reservations whether such exceptions\n               can be carved out particularly keeping in mind the\n\fCriminal Appeal Nos.62-63 of 2014\nAnokhilal v.

Any\n                     such rule is bound to be qualified one. Such\n                     rule cannot also be evolved merely to shift\n                     the burden of proving justification on to the\n                     shoulders of the prosecution. In every case\n                     of complaint of denial of right to speedy\n                     trial, it is primarily for the prosecution to\n                     justify and explain the delay.

Since the\n                  object is to mete out justice and to convict\n                  the guilty and protect the innocent, the trial\n                  should be a search for the truth and not a\n                  bout over technicalities, and must be\n                  conducted under such rules as will protect\n                  the innocent, and punish the guilty.

The right to speedy trial\n               is in its very nature relative. It depends upon diverse\n               circumstances. Each case of delay in conclusion of a\n               criminal trial has to be seen in the facts and\n               circumstances of such case. Mere lapse of several\n               years since the commencement of prosecution by\n               itself may not justify the discontinuance of\n               prosecution or dismissal of indictment. The factors\n               concerning the accused’s right to speedy trial have to\n               be weighed vis-à-vis the impact of the crime on\n               society and the confidence of the people in judicial\n               system. Speedy trial secures rights to an accused but it\n               does not preclude the rights of public justice. The\n               nature and gravity of crime, persons involved, social\n               impact and societal needs must be weighed along with\n               the right of the accused to speedy trial and if the\n               balance tilts in favour of the former the long delay in\n               conclusion of criminal trial should not operate against\n               the continuation of prosecution and if the right of the\n               accused in the facts and circumstances of the case and\n               exigencies of situation tilts the balance in his favour,\n               the prosecution may be brought to an end. These\n               principles must apply as well when the appeal court is\n               confronted with the question whether or not retrial of\n               an accused should be ordered.”\n\fCriminal Appeal Nos.62-63 of 2014\nAnokhilal v.

The letter further stated that\n                 this exercise was made mandatory as per the\n                 directions of the Supreme Court Legal Services\n                 Committee.        This Court readily agreed 24 and\n                 adjourned the matters. On the adjourned date, we\n                 enquired from Mr. Shikhil Suri, learned advocate\n                 whether he could successfully get in touch with the\n                 accused concerned.        According to the learned\n                 advocate he could not get in touch with the accused in\n                 the first matter but could speak with his sister whereas\n                 in the second matter he could have video conference\n                 with the accused.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">                 <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"183302437\" id=\"span_67\">5. In our view such a direction on part of the\n                 Supreme Court Legal Services Committee is quite\n                 commendable and praiseworthy. Very often we see\n                 that the learned advocates who appear in matters\n                 entrusted by the Supreme Court Legal Services\n                 Committee, do not have the advantage of having had\n                 a dialogue with either the accused or those who are in\n                 the know of the details about the case. This at times\n                 seriously hampers the efforts on part of the learned\n                 advocates. All such attempts to facilitate dialogue\n                 between the counsel and his client would further the\n                 cause of justice and make legal aid meaningful.

In the present case, the Amicus Curiae, was appointed on\n\n      19.02.2013, and on the same date, the counsel was called upon to defend\n\n      the accused at the stage of framing of charges. One can say with certainty\n\n      that the Amicus Curiae did not have sufficient time to go through even\n\n      the basic documents, nor the advantage of any discussion or interaction\n\n      with the accused, and time to reflect over the matter.

In our considered view, the Trial Court on its own, ought to have\n\n      adjourned the matter for some time so that the Amicus Curiae could have\n\n      had the advantage of sufficient time to prepare the matter. The approach\n\n      adopted by the Trial Court, in our view, may have expedited the conduct\n\n      of trial, but did not further the cause of justice. Not only were the charges\n\n      framed the same day as stated above, but the trial itself was concluded\n\n      within a fortnight thereafter. In the process, the assistance that the\n\n      appellant was entitled to in the form of legal aid, could not be real and\n\n      meaningful.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_113\">      16.   There are other issues which also arise in the matter namely that\n\n      the examination of 13 witnesses within seven days, the examination of\n\n      the accused under the provisions of the Section 313 of the Code even\n\n      before the complete evidence was led by the prosecution, and not waiting\n\n      for the FSL and DNA reports in the present case. DNA report definitely\n\n      formed the foundation of discussion by the High Court. However, the\n\n      record shows that the DNA report was received almost at the fag end of\n\fCriminal Appeal Nos.62-63 of 2014\nAnokhilal v.

The concluding paragraphs of the judgment of the Trial Court show\n\n      that the entire trial was completed in less than one month with the\n\n      assistance of the prosecution as well as the defense, but, such expeditious\n\n      disposal definitely left glaring gaps.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_114\">      17.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"66160930\" id=\"span_73\">In <a href=\"/doc/66160930/\" id=\"a_120\">V.K.

In no\n                      circumstance, can the cause of justice be made\n                      to suffer, though, undoubtedly, it is highly\n                      desirable that the finality of any trial is achieved\n                      in the quickest possible time.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_115\">      18.      Expeditious disposal is undoubtedly required in criminal matters\n\n      and that would naturally be part of guarantee of fair trial.           However, the\n\n      attempts to expedite the process should not be at the expense of the basic\n\n      elements of fairness and the opportunity to the accused, on which\n\n      postulates, the entire criminal administration of justice is founded.

What is paramount is the cause of\n\n      justice and keeping the basic ingredients which secure that as a core idea\n\n      and ideal, the process may be expedited, but fast tracking of process\n\n      must never ever result in burying the cause of justice.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_116\">      19.   In the circumstances, going by the principles laid down in\n\n      Bashira2, we accept the submission made by Mr. Luthra, the learned\n\n      Amicus Curiae and hold that the learned counsel appointed through\n\n      Legal Services to represent the appellant in the present case ought to\n\n      have been afforded sufficient opportunity to study the matter and the\n\n      infraction in that behalf resulted in miscarriage of justice.
