These Criminal Appeals, by way of special leave, are filed\n\nby the appellants against a common order dated 26 th October, 2007\n\npassed by the High Court of Bombay at Goa in Criminal Revision\n\nApplication Nos. 3, 10, 19, 21 and 22 of 2007, whereby the High\n\nCourt while setting aside the charges framed by the learned Special\n\nJudge, Panaji against the accused—appellants for the offences\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 120-B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_2\">409</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_3\">420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1317063/\" id=\"a_4\">465</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_5\">471</a>, IPCand\n\ndirected to frame charges against them under <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_6\">Sections 13 (1)(d)(i)</a>\n\nand <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_7\">13(1)(d)(ii)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988 read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 120-B</a>, IPC.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\f                                      3</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">2.         In a nutshell, the genesis of the dispute in all these\n\nappealspertains to a Notification dated 30 thSeptember, 1991 issued\n\nby the Government of Goa, duly approved by the Cabinet, according\n\nto which those industrial units who apply for bona fide use of High\n\nTension or Low Tension power supply to their industrial units\n\nwould be eligible for a rebate of 25% in their tariff for a period of five\n\nyears. The appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 315 of 2011 (Accused\n\nNo. 1) was the Minister of Power for the State of Goa during the\n\nperiod 22-12-1994 to 29-07-1998 whereas the appellant in\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 313 of 2011 (Accused No. 2) was also a public\n\nservant at that time being Chief Electrical Engineer.Accused Nos. 3\n\nand 4 were Managing Director and Executive Director, respectively,\n\nof the appellant Company in Criminal Appeal 314 of 2011 (Accused\n\nNo. 6), while the appellant in Criminal Appeal No. 312 of 2011\n\n(Accused No. 5) was the General Manager of appellant Company in\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 311 of 2011 (Accused No. 7).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">3.         The Government of Goa, during the tenure of accused No.\n\n1 as Minister of Power, with the consent of Cabinet, issued another\n\nNotification dated 31-03-1995 cancelling the earlier Notification\n\ndated 30-09-1991 without assigning any reason for its cancellation.\n\nAfterwards, it is alleged that another Notification dated 15-5-1996\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">\f                                   4</span>\n\nwas issued, without approval of the Cabinet introducing another\n\ncategory of ‘Extra High Tension’ power supply and after that one\n\nmore Notification dated 01-08-1996 was issued, again without\n\nCabinet approval, restoring the benefit of 25% rebate, at the\n\ninstance of accused No. 1, only to benefit accused nos. 6 &amp; 7\n\nCompanies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">4.        Acting upon a complaint lodged by an M.L.A., the State\n\nlevelled allegations against the accused individuals that by entering\n\ninto a criminal conspiracy they provided wrongful gains to both the\n\nappellant Companies (Accused Nos. 6 &amp; 7) and favored the two\n\nCompanies for availing 25% rebate on power tariff by illegal means\n\nand thereby caused huge loss of Rs.4,52,77,856/- to the exchequer\n\nof Government of Goa.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">5.        Taking note of the allegations levelled against the\n\naccused, the Special Judge, Panaji by order dated 8 thDecember,\n\n2006 framed charges against the accused—appellants for the\n\noffences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 120-B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_10\">409</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_11\">420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1317063/\" id=\"a_12\">465</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_13\">468</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_14\">471</a>, IPC and also under <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 13(1)(d)(i)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_16\">13(1)(d)(ii)</a> read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1259316/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 13(2)</a> of the Prevention of Corruption Act, 1988. The\n\naggrieved appellants approached the High Court by way of Criminal\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">\f                                   5</span>\n\nRevision Applications. The High Court on the analysis of facts,\n\narrived at the conclusion that the facts of the case do not disclose\n\nan offence of cheating and there was no offence of criminal breach\n\nof trust. Accordingly, the appellants were discharged from the\n\noffences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_18\">Sections 120-B</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1326844/\" id=\"a_19\">409</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1436241/\" id=\"a_20\">420</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1317063/\" id=\"a_21\">465</a>, <a href=\"/doc/556166/\" id=\"a_22\">468</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1466184/\" id=\"a_23\">471</a>, IPC. However, the High Court observed that there is sufficient\n\nprima facie material against the accused for framing charges\n\nagainst them under <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 13(1)(d)(i)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/178303/\" id=\"a_25\">13(1)(d)(ii)</a> read with\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1897847/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 120-B</a>, IPC. Feeling aggrieved thereby, the accused—\n\nappellants are before us in these appeals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">6.        We have heard Mr. M.L. Varma, learned Senior counsel\n\nappearing for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.315/2011, Ms.\n\nBinu Tamta, learned counsel appearing for the appellant in\n\nCriminal Appeal No.311 of 2011, Ms. Asha Gopalan Nair, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the appellant in Criminal Appeal No.313 of\n\n2011 and alsothe learned counsel appearing for the State of Goa at\n\nlength.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">7.        Learned senior counsel for the appellant in Criminal\n\nAppeal No. 315 of 2011 relying upon this Court’s order in Civil\n\nAppeal Nos. 3206-3217 of 1999, passed on 13 th February, 2001\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">\f                                   6</span>\n\nwhile dealing with the same Notifications, submitted that there is\n\nno need to continue further criminal proceedings against the\n\nappellants herein. The said order reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     “The High Court by the impugned judgment has held that\n     the circular dated 31st March, 1998 issued by the\n     Government of Goa suspending the release of rebate with\n     immediate effect as well as suspension of rebate agreed\n     to be governed in sixty monthly installments has no legal\n     efficacy and is, therefore, invalid. The High Court has\n     further held that the notification dated 24th July, 1998 is\n     legal and valid. Consequently the High Court directed\n     that the writ petitioners are entitled to 25% rebate in\n     power tariff till 26th July, 1998. This has been\n     challenged by means of the present appeals. Second set\n     of appeals have been filed by the writ petitioners against\n     the judgment of the High Court whereby and whereunder\n     the High Court has held that notification dated 27th July\n     1998 is valid.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     We have heard counsel for the parties and perused the\n     record. The High Court has taken the aforesaid view after\n     taking into consideration overall facts and circumstances\n     and inasmuch as public interest which, according to us,\n     is very balanced view of the matter. We, therefore, are not\n     inclined to interfere with the matters Both the sets of\n     appeals fail and are accordingly dismissed. There shall be\n     no order as to costs”.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"814552\" id=\"span_5\">8.        It is further argued before us that the High Court erred in\n\nnot taking into account the factum that the complaint against the\n\naccused—appellants was filed by political opponent of the appellant\n\nwhohad foisted the charges which are mala fide, misconceived and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">\f                                   7</span>\n\nconcocted with a view to score political vendetta.Whereas power\n\nrebate policy was existing in the State since 1991 and in 1993, out\n\nof the High Tension category an Extra High Tension category was\n\ncarved out by the Government for the purpose of providing\n\nadditional benefit to industrial consumers. Drawing our attention to\n\na judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/814552/\" id=\"a_27\">MRF Limited vs. Manohar Parrikar &amp;\n\nOthers</a>, (2010) 11 SCC 374, learned senior counsel submitted that\n\nthis Court has already considered the Notifications in question, in\n\nan earlier round of litigation and expressed the view that the\n\ndecision taken by the appellant herein—accused No. 1 as a Minister\n\nwas balanced.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1827163\" id=\"span_7\">9.        Ms. Binu Tamta, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nappellantsin Criminal Appeal Nos. 311 &amp; 312 of 2011 submitted\n\nthat as a matter of fact, the complaint in question was already\n\nclosed on 2.2.1999, but to meet the political will of the complainant\n\nwhen he came to power in the State, the complaint was reopened at\n\nhis instance. The view taken by the Courts below in framing\n\ncharges against the accused is entirely wrong inasmuch as the trial\n\nCourt made an observation that the circumstances give rise to\n\nsuspicion that accused Nos. 1 to 5 conspired to extend benefit to\n\nthe accused Nos. 6 &amp; 7 Companies. Mere suspicion does not\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">\f                                   8</span>\n\nwarrant framing of charges against the appellants. learned counsel\n\nwrongly placed reliance on a decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1827163/\" id=\"a_28\">Hira Lal\n\nHari Lal Bhagwati Vs. CBI, New Delhi</a>, (2003) 5 SCC 257 and\n\nsubmitted that by virtue of the Notifications in question, no benefit\n\nwas got by the appellant and whatever amount had to be paid, has\n\nalready been paid, and accordingly the charges against the\n\nappellant should be dropped.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">10.       Learned counsel appearing for the appellant in Criminal\n\nAppeal No.313 of 2011, Ms. Asha G. Nair, submitted that the\n\nappellant in his official capacity had only made submissions in\n\naccordance with the instructions received by superiors in the\n\nnormal course of discharging his official duties. By any stretch of\n\nimagination, the appellant cannot be equated as conspirator when\n\nthe deciding authorities were the Secretary and the Minister. She\n\nhas further submitted that the appellant has already retired from\n\nhis service and virtually he has no role to play in the alleged\n\nconspiracy and the allegation that he is close to Minister does not\n\nform a ground for levelling charges against him.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">11.       Learned counsel for the State while supporting the\n\nimpugned judgment, submitted that there was enough material on\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">\f                                     9</span>\n\nrecord to establish that accused Nos. 1 &amp; 2, being public servants\n\nat the relevant time, had entered into a criminal conspiracy to\n\nfacilitate wrongful gains to accused Nos. 6 &amp; 7 Companies in\n\ncollusion with their officials (accused Nos. 3 &amp; 4). In pursuit of their\n\ncriminal conspiracy, they abused their positions and caused huge\n\nloss to the public exchequer and benefited accused Companies by\n\nillegal means. It is also vehemently argued that accused No. 1 while\n\nabusing his official capacity prepared a false document giving an\n\nappearance of genuine one and deceived the Government in taking\n\npolicy decision and enabled the accused Companies to avail 25%\n\nrebate on power supply. He ultimately made a submission that\n\ntaking note of misdeeds of all the accused, the High court has in\n\nclear terms expressed the opinion that there is sufficient prima facie\n\nmaterial to frame charges against all the accused, hence there is no\n\noccasion for this Court to interfere and revisit the matter.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"132212265\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"132324345\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"68365\" id=\"span_12\">12.       At the outset it would be pertinent to note the law\n\nconcerning the framing of charges and the standard which courts\n\nmust apply while framing charges. It is well settled that a court\n\nwhile framing charges under <a href=\"/doc/1056165/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 227</a> of the Code of Criminal\n\nProcedure should apply the prima facie standard. Although the\n\napplication of this standard depends on facts and circumstance in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">\f                                    10</span>\n\neach case, a prima facie case against the accused is said to be made\n\nout when the probative value of the evidence on all the essential\n\nelements in the charge taken as a whole is such that it is sufficient\n\nto induce the court to believe in the existence of the facts pertaining\n\nto such essential elements or to consider its existence so probable\n\nthat a prudent man ought to act upon the supposition that those\n\nfacts existed or did happen. However, at this stage, there cannot be\n\na roving enquiry into the pros and cons of the matter and weigh the\n\nevidence as if he was conducting a trial. [<a href=\"/doc/68365/\" id=\"a_30\">Refer Sajjan Kumar v.\n\nCBI</a>, (2010) 9 SCC 368; <a href=\"/doc/132324345/\" id=\"a_31\">State v. A.

Selvi and\n\nOrs.</a>, (2018) 1 SCALE 5.]</span></span></span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">13.       Having thoughtfully considered the arguments advanced\n\nby respective learned counsel and upon going through the record,\n\nparticularly the impugned judgment, in the light of sequence of\n\nevents, prima facie, it cannot be said that no case can be made out\n\nagainst the accused—appellants. Allegedly, the Notifications dated\n\n15-5-1996 and 1-8-1996 were issued without the approval of\n\nCabinet and by violation of rules. Looking at the facts of the case in\n\na holistic manner, we do not think it necessary to go into the aspect\n\nof thorough examination of merits of the case, particularly when the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">\f                                    11</span>\n\nissue is still at the stage of framing of charges only. There is no\n\nerror in framing charges, as suggested by the High Court, when\n\npresumably the material on record obligated the Court to do so.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">14.       In light of the above discussion, we do not see any\n\nillegality in the impugned order. Therefore, we find no reason to\n\ninterfere with the order passed by the High Court. However, learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the appellants, at this stage wants to place\n\nbefore the trial Court, the material, judgments and the earlier\n\npassed order of this Court which are referred before us.
