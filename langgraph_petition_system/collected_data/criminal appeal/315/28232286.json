It is submitted by the counsel for the appellant that the\n      2  THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias Lalu Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nSessions Judge, Bhind by its order dated 10/8/2021 passed in BA\n\nNo.978/2021 has granted bail to the co-accused Gajendra Singh,\n\nwhose case is identical to that of the present appellant. It is further\n\nsubmitted that according to the prosecution case, the appellant and\n\nother co-accused persons, namely, Daplu alias Omkar and Gajendra\n\nhad assaulted the deceased-Shyamlal by means of Lathi and\n\nthereafter they took him to JA Hospital, Gwalior, where they got the\n\ndeceased-Shyamlal admitted in the name of Nathuram and ultimately\n\nShyamlal succumbed to the injuries. Death certificate in the name of\n\nNathuram was also prepared, however, at a later stage it was found\n\nthat in fact Nathuram had already expired on 15/6/2013 and the\n\nappellant and other co-accused, namely, Daplu alias Omkar and\n\nGajendra Singh Narwariya had got the injured admitted in the\n\nhospital in the fake name. The case of the present appellant is\n\nidentical to that of the co-accused Gajendra. The appellant is in jail\n\nfrom 19/2/2021. The trial is likely to take sufficiently long time and\n\nthere is no possibility of his absconding or tampering with the\n\nprosecution case.\n\n6.       Per contra, it is submitted by counsel for State that there are\n\nserious allegations of assaulting the deceased Shyamlal by Lathi and\n\nabove all the appellant as well as co-accused Omkar and Gajendra\n\nSingh took the deceased Shyamlal to the hospital and got him\n      3  THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias Lalu Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nadmitted in the fake name of Nathuram and also succeeded in getting\n\nthe death certificate in the name of Nathuram, whereas Nathuram had\n\nalready expired on 15/06/2013.\n\n7.       Considered the submissions made by learned counsel for\n\nparties.\n\n8.       According to prosecution case, the complainant Upendra Singh\n\nJatav made a complaint to the police that his neighbor Shyamlal was\n\nbeaten by the appellant, Daplu S/o Nathu Singh Narwariya, Gajendra\n\nSingh Narwariya, about 6-7 days back and thereafter they took the\n\ninjured to Gwalior and from thereafter the whereabouts of Shyamlal\n\nare not known. On this information, an enquiry was initiated and the\n\nstatement of witnesses in the Merg enquiry were recorded. The Police\n\nfound that in fact the deceased Shyamlal was beaten by appellant, co-\n\naccused Daplu @ Omkar and Gajendra by Lathi and thereafter they\n\ntook the deceased to Gwalior and got him admitted in the J.A.\n\nHospital Gwalior in the fake name of Nathuram S/o Hukum Singh.\n\nThe injured Shyamlal who was admitted in the hospital by co-\n\naccused Omkar Singh in the name of Nathuram s/o Hukum expired\n\non 08/06/2020. Accordingly, the dead body of Shyamlal was handed\n\nover to Omkar Singh after the postmortem. It appears that the dead\n\nbody of Shyamlal, who was admitted in the fake name of Nathuram,\n\nwas not brought in the village and his cremation was done\n      4  THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias Lalu Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nsomewhere else and since whereabouts of Shyamlal was not known,\n\ntherefore, his neighbor Upendra Singh had made a report to the\n\nPolice. During the Merg enquiry, the statement of witnesses were\n\nrecorded who had claimed that the name of deceased was Nathuram\n\nand ultimately those statements found to be incorrect. Thus, the\n\nPolice after completing investigation, has filed the charge-sheet\n\nagainst the present appellant, Omkar Singh and Gajendra Singh apart\n\nfrom Ghanshyam, Ravindra, Vinod Sharma, Smt. Sangeeta, Upendra\n\nSingh Jatav, Jarman Singh Narwariya, Hotam Singh Narwariya and\n\nSudamalal Kadere. The allegations against the remaining co-accused\n\npersons are that they had given false information to the Police. Thus,\n\nthere are two sets of accused persons which are as under :\n\n1.       Sikander Singh Narwariya      @ Lalu, Omkar @ Daplu and\n\n         Gajendra Singh against whom it is alleged that not only they\n\n         had assaulted the deceased Shyamlal by Lathi, but they took\n\n         him to the hospital and got him admitted in the hospital in the\n\n         fake name of Nathuram and after the death of Shyamlal on\n\n         08.06.2020, who was admitted in the fake name of Nathuram,\n\n         his dead-body was received by co-accused Omkar and it was\n\n         not brought to the village and the cremation was done\n\n         somewhere else in Gwalior itself.\n\n2.       Whereas, the allegations against the remaining co-accused\n      5  THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias Lalu Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n         persons are that they had given false information to the Police\n\n         that Nathuram had fallen from the roof of the house and he\n\n         died in the hospital.\n\n9.       The appellant has filed the copy of order dated 10/8/2021\n\npassed by Sessions Judge, Bhind in B.A. No.978/2021 by which the\n\nco-accused Gajendra Singh was granted bail. This Court has gone\n\nthrough the order passed by the Sessions Judge, Bhind. The relevant\n\npart of the order is reproduced as under:\n\n                      &quot;According to prosecution case, on dt.\n               29.05.2020 or 31.05.2020 at or about 07:00 to\n               08:00 AM accused person nemly Gajendra Singh,\n               Sikandar Singh, Omkar Singh, Sudama Kadere,\n               Hotam Singh, Jarman Singh, Upendra Singh &amp;\n               Sangeeta Narwariya has assaulted the Nathuram\n               S/o Hukum Singh with Dandas, as seized from the\n               accused persons. The said Nathuram sustain\n               various injuries including vitol part and\n               succumbed to the injuries.\n                      Ld.

Further    custodial\n               interrogation is no more required and no purpose\n       6 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias Lalu Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n               would be served to continue incarceration of\n               applicant. Co-accused Jarman Singh, Smt.\n               Sangeeta, Upendra Jatav, Hotam Singh has been\n               enlearged on bail by Hon&#x27;ble High Court of\n               Madhya Pradesh, Bench at Gwalior in CRA No.\n               4328/21, CRA No. 4204/21, CRA No. 3964/21 &amp;\n               CRA No. 4075/21 respectively. Role of the\n               applicant is not specifically mentioned in the\n               Charge-Sheet.\n                     Considering the above facts and looking to\n               special circumstances of second wave Covid-19\n               pendemic and that early conclusion of the trial is a\n               bleak possibility and looking the nature and\n               gravity of accusations, means and standing of the\n               applicant, danger of applicant absconding, if\n               granted Bail and reasonable apprehension of the\n               witnesses being influenced and applying the\n               doctrin of parity this Court deem it proper and fit\n               to enlarge the applicant on Bail. Accordingly, the\n               Bail Application dt. 04.08.2021 is hereby\n               allowed.&quot;\n\n10.       Thus it is clear that the Sessions Judge, Bhind has mentioned\n\nthat the allegation against Gajendra, appellant, Omkar Singh, Sudama\n\nKadere, Hotam Singh, Jarman Singh, Upendra Singh and Sangeeta\n\nNarwariya are similar as all of them had assaulted Nathuram S/o\n\nHukum Singh with dandas whereas the aforesaid observation is\n\ncompletely false and there are no allegation of assault against\n\nSudama Kadere, Hotam Singh, Jarman Singh, Upendra Jatav and\n\nSangeeta Narwariya. Further, the Court below has held that the High\n\nCourt has also granted bail to the co-accused Sangeeta Narwariya by\n\norder dated 29/7/2021 passed in Criminal Appeal No.4204/2021, the\n\nco-accused Jarman Singh passed in Criminal Appeal No.4328/2021\n       7 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias Lalu Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nto Upendra Singh by order dated 9/7/2021 passed in Criminal appeal\n\nNo.3964/2021 to Hotam Singh passed in Criminal Appeal\n\nNo.4075/2021.\n\n11.       Surprisingly, it was also mentioned by the Court below that the\n\nrole of the appellant is not specifically mentioned in the charge sheet.\n\nUnfortunately, the above-mentioned observation made by the\n\nSessions Judge, Bhind is just contrary to record. In the charge sheet\n\nitself it is mentioned as under:\n\n                        ^^exZ vuqla/kku esa lk{kh ghjk flag ujofj;k dksVokj\n                xzke enuiwjk us vius dFkuksa esa e`rd dk &#x27;;keyky tkVo\n                iq= cq)w yky tkVo gksuk rFkk fnukad 29-05-2020 dks xzke\n                enuiqjk ds yYyw ujofj;k] Miyw mQZ vksedkj ujofj;k\n                iq=x.k Lo- Jh ukFkwflag ujofj;k ,oa xtsanz flag ujofj;k\n                ds }kjk ezrd &#x27;;keyky dh mlds vkokl bUnzk vkokl\n                dkWyksuh enuiqjk es ykBh MaMks ls ekjihV djuk ftlls\n                mlds flj ds cxy esa M.Ms dh pksV ls [kwu cg tkuk vkSj\n                pksV vkuk vkSj mlds ckn bu rhuksa yksxks ds }kjk ezrd\n                &#x27;;keyky dks yksfMax xkMh esa Mkydj bykt ds fy;s xkao\n                ls ys tkuk crk;k gSA^^\n\n12.       Thus in the charge sheet it was specifically mentioned that\n\n29/5/2020 the appellant, the co-accused Daplu @ Omkar Singh,\n\nGajendra Singh had assaulted the injured/deceased Shyamlal by lathi\n\nand thereafter all the three persons took the injured Shyamlal to the\n\nhospital. Even in the police case diary there are various witnesses\n\nwho have specifically stated that Shyamlal was beaten by the\n\nappellant and co-accused Daplu @ Omkar Singh and Gajendra and\n\nthey took the injured to hospital on their loading vehicle. It is really\n    8    THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias Lalu Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\nsurprising that the Sessions Judge has given a complete go by to the\n\nallegations made by the co-accused Gajendra in the charge sheet and\n\nhas granted bail to him by observing certain facts which are just\n\ncontrary to record. Further, by referring to the orders of bail granted\n\nto the co-accused persons the Sessions Judge, Bhind has given an\n\nimpression that the case of the co-accused Gajendra is identical to\n\nthat of the co-accused Jarman Singh, Smt. Sangeeta Narwariya,\n\nUpendra Singh and Hotam Singh which is not correct. For the sake of\n\nconvenience, this Court is reproducing the relevant part of order\n\npassed in the case of Upendra Jatav on 9/7/2021 in Criminal Appeal\n\nNo.3964/2021:\n\n                   &quot;It is submitted the appellant has been\n            falsely implicated in the case. He has not\n            committed any offence in any manner. As per the\n            prosecution story, the appellant was initially the\n            complainant in the case who has informed the\n            Police authorities regarding the offence but\n            subsequently he has joined with the accused\n            persons and given a false statement pointing out\n            the fact that Nathuram has died in the incident.\n            During the investigation, it was found that\n            Nathuram had expired in the year 2013 itself and\n            it was Shyamlal who has beaten by the co-accused\n            persons and owing to the injuries has expired in\n            the matter. It is argued that there is no allegation\n            of inflicting any injury to the deceased on the\n            present appellant. As per the prosecution story\n            only he has to save the other accused persons by\n            informing the false name to the Police authorities\n            regarding deceased. He is in custody since\n            20.02.2021. Investigation is over and charge-sheet\n            has already been filed. Appellant is the first\n            offender. The appellant is ready to abide by all the\n       9 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias Lalu Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n                terms and conditions which may be imposed by\n                this court while considering the application for\n                grant of bail.\n                       Per contra, learned Panel Lawyer for the\n                State opposed the application stating that there is\n                active participation of the appellant in\n                commission of offence. He has tried to save all\n                the other accused persons who have inflicted\n                injuries to the deceased and given false\n                statement to the Police authorities but he fairly\n                admits the fact that he was the first informer\n                regarding the commission of offence. Filing of\n                charge-sheet and appellant being the first\n                offender is not disputed by the State counsel. All\n                other co-accused are in custody.&quot;\n\n13.       Similarly, the co-accused Jarman Singh has been granted bail\n\nby order dated 29/7/2021 passed in Criminal Appeal No.4328/2021\n\nwith the following observations:\n\n                       &quot;It is submitted by the counsel the appellant\n                that the only allegation is regarding concealing the\n                fact that he has disclosed the incorrect information\n                to the Police authorities regarding the deceased by\n                providing incorrect name. Appellant claims parity\n                with co-accused Sudhamalal who was enlarged on\n                bail vide order dated 22.07.2021 passed in\n                Cr.A.4082/2021.\n                       Per contra, learned Public Prosecutor for the\n                State could not dispute the fact the factum of\n                parity to the co-accused. There is no allegation\n                against the appellant regarding committing of\n                offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 302</a> of IPC. Incorrect\n                information was provided to              the Police\n                authorities.\n                       Considering the overall facts and\n                circumstances of the case without commenting\n                upon the merits of the case, this Court deems it\n                appropriate to allow this application subject to the\n                verification of the fact that appellant is having no\n                criminal history. Accordingly, the application is\n       10 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias Lalu Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n                 allowed.&quot;\n\n14.        Thus it is clear that the co-accused persons were granted bail\n\non the ground that there is no allegation of assaulting the deceased\n\nShyamlal and the only allegations were that they have given incorrect\n\ninformation to police whereas there are specific allegation of assault\n\nagainst the appellant, co-accused Gajendra Singh and Daplu @\n\nOmkar Singh. Thus it is clear that the Sessions Judge, Bhind has\n\ncompletely ignored the factual aspect of the matter. That is not the\n\nend of the case.\n\n15.        It appears that the Sessions Judge, Bhind has also completely\n\nignored the legal aspect of the matter. Whenever a Court grants bail\n\non the ground of parity, then it is always expected that the Court shall\n\ndetermine whether the reasons of parity are made out or not.\n\n16.        The Supreme Court in the case of Shri Mahadev Meena vs.\n\nPraveen Rathore &amp; Anr. by order dated 27/9/2021 passed in\n\nCriminal Appeal No.1089/2021 has held as under:\n\n                 &quot;13. Having analyzed prima facie the\n                 circumstances in which the offence was committed\n                 and the nature of the allegations, it will be useful\n                 to refer to the precedents of this Court governing\n                 the grant of bail. A two-judge Bench of this Court\n                 in Ram Govind Upadhyay v. Sudharshan Singh\n                 has listed the considerations that govern the grant\n                 of bail without attributing an exhaustive character\n                 to them. This Court has observed:\n                        &quot;4. Apart from the above, certain other\n                        which may be attributed to be relevant\n    11    THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias Lalu Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n                  considerations may also be noticed at this\n                  juncture, though however, the same are only\n                  illustrative and not exhaustive, neither there\n                  can be any. The considerations being:\n                  (a) While granting bail the court has to keep\n                  in mind not only the nature of the\n                  accusations, but the severity of the\n                  punishment, if the accusation entails a\n                  conviction and the nature of evidence in\n                  support of the accusations.\n                  (b) Reasonable apprehensions of the\n                  witnesses being tampered with or the\n                  apprehension of there being a threat for the\n                  complainant should also weigh with the\n                  court in the matter of grant of bail.\n                  (c) While it is not expected to have the\n                  entire evidence establishing the guilt of the\n                  accused beyond reasonable doubt but there\n                  ought always to be a prima facie satisfaction\n                  of the court in support of the charge.\n                  (d) Frivolity in prosecution should\n                  always be considered and it is only the\n                  element of genuineness that shall have to be\n                  considered in the matter of grant of bail, and\n                  in the event of there being some doubt as to\n                  the genuineness of the prosecution, in the\n                  normal course of events, the accused is\n                  entitled to an order of bail.&quot;\n                  This Court has further elucidated on the\n           power of the court to interfere with an order of bail\n           in the following terms:\n                  &quot;3. Grant of bail though being a\n                  discretionary order -- but, however, calls for\n                  exercise of such a discretion in a judicious\n                  manner and not as a matter of course. Order\n                  for bail bereft of any cogent reason cannot\n                  be sustained.&quot;\n                  The above principles have been reiterated by\n           a two judge Bench of this Court in Prasanta\n           Kumar Sarkar v. Ashis Chatterjee:\n                  &quot;9. ... It is trite that this Court does not,\n                  normally, interfere with an order passed by\n                  the High Court granting or rejecting bail to\n                  the accused. However, it is equally\n    12    THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias Lalu Vs.

It is\n                 well       settled     that,    among     other\n                 circumstances, the factors to be borne in\n                 mind while considering an application for\n                 bail are:\n                 (i) whether there is any prima facie or\n                 reasonable ground to believe that the\n                 accused had committed the offence;\n                 (ii) nature and gravity of the accusation;\n                 (iii) severity of the punishment in the event\n                 of conviction;\n                 (iv) danger of the accused absconding or\n                 fleeing, if released on bail;\n                 (v) character, behaviour, means, position and\n                 standing of the accused;\n                 (vi) likelihood of the offence being repeated;\n                 (vii) reasonable apprehension of the\n                 witnesses being influenced; and\n                 (viii) danger, of course, of justice being\n                 thwarted by grant of bail.\n                         [internal citation omitted]&quot;\n                 In Ramesh Bhavan Rathod v. Vishanbhai\n           Hirabhai Makwana, a two judge Bench of this\n           Court of which one of us (Justice DY\n           Chandrachud) was a part, has held that the High\n           Court while granting bail must focus on the role of\n           the accused in deciding the aspect of parity. This\n           Court observed:\n                         &quot;26....The High Court has evidently\n                 misunderstood the central aspect of what is\n                 meant by parity. Parity while granting bail\n                 must focus upon the role of the accused.\n                 Merely observing that another accused who\n                 was granted bail was armed with a similar\n                 weapon is not sufficient to determine\n                 whether a case for the grant of bail on the\n                 basis of parity has been established. In\n                 deciding the aspect of parity, the role\n                 attached to the accused, their position in\n                 relation to the incident and to the victims is\n    13    THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias Lalu Vs. State of M.P. and another\n\n                    of utmost importance. The High Court has\n                    proceeded on the basis of parity on a\n                    simplistic assessment as noted above, which\n                    again cannot pass muster under the law.&quot;\n             14. The High Court ought to have had due\n             regard to the seriousness and gravity of the crime.\n             The deceased was employed with the Intelligence\n             Bureau in New Delhi. The first respondent is an</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1\">             employee of the Anti-Corruption Bureau at\n             Jhalawar. The material which has emerged during\n             the course of investigation cannot simply be\n             ignored or glossed over (as the High Court has\n             done). The first respondent himself being an\n             employee of the Anti-Corruption Bureau at\n             Jhalawar, the likelihood of the evidence being\n             tampered with and of the witnesses being\n             suborned cannot be discounted. At this stage,\n             when the Court is called upon to evaluate whether\n             a case for the grant of bail has been made out, it is\n             inappropriate to enter upon matters which would\n             form the subject of the trial when evidence is\n             adduced by the prosecution. Bail was granted to\n             the co-accused Anita Meena primarily and\n             substantially on the ground that she had a child of\n             eleven months with her in jail. This cannot be the\n             basis to a claim of parity on the part of the first\n             respondent. The first respondent cannot claim\n             parity with the co-accused since the allegations in\n             the FIR and the material that has emerged from the\n             investigation indicate that a major role has been\n             attributed to him in the murder of the deceased.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_2\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"41350772\" id=\"span_1\">Further, the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/41350772/\" id=\"a_19\">Ramesh Bhavan\n\nRathod vs. Vishanbhai Hirabhai Makwana (Koli) &amp; Anr.</a> reported\n\nin (2021) 6 SCC 230 has held as under:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7447\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"182015707\" id=\"span_3\">&quot;26. Another aspect of the case which needs\n             emphasis is the manner in which the High Court\n             has applied the principle of parity.

The High Court\n                has evidently misunderstood the central aspect of\n                what is meant by parity. Parity while granting bail\n                must focus upon the role of the accused. Merely\n                observing that another accused who was granted\n                bail was armed with a similar weapon is not\n                sufficient to determine whether a case for the\n                grant of bail on the basis of parity has been\n                established. In deciding the aspect of parity, the\n                role attached to the accused, their position in\n                relation to the incident and to the victims is of\n                utmost importance. The High Court has proceeded\n                on the basis of parity on a simplistic assessment as\n                noted above, which again cannot pass muster\n                under the law.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_5\">17.        Thus, it is clear that whenever an accused seeks bail on the\n\nground of parity, then the Court must focus upon the role of the\n\naccused. The role played by the aspirant in the incident should be\n\nconsidered in order to find out as to whether the case of the aspirant\n\nwho is seeking bail is identical to that of the co-accused, who has\n\nalready been granted bail or not.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7447\" id=\"span_5\">15 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias <a href=\"/doc/7447/\" id=\"a_23\">Lalu Vs.

State of M.P. and another</a>\n\n            individual. It is for this reason that this Court does\n            not ordinarily interfere with an order of the High\n            Court granting bail. However, where the\n            discretion of the High Court to grant bail has been\n            exercised without the due application of mind or\n            in contravention of the directions of this Court,\n            such an order granting bail is liable to be set\n            aside.

We are absolutely conscious that\n            liberty of a person should not be lightly dealt\n            with, for deprivation of liberty of a person has\n            immense impact on the mind of a person.\n            Incarceration creates a concavity in the\n            personality of an individual. Sometimes it causes\n            a sense of vacuum. Needless to emphasise, the\n            sacrosanctity of liberty is paramount in a civilised\n            society. However, in a democratic body polity\n            which is wedded to the rule of law an individual\n            is expected to grow within the social restrictions\n            sanctioned by law. The individual liberty is\n            restricted by larger social interest and its\n            deprivation must have due sanction of law. In an\n            orderly society an individual is expected to live\n            with dignity having respect for law and also\n            giving due respect to others&#x27; rights. It is a well-\n            accepted principle that the concept of liberty is\n            not in the realm of absolutism but is a restricted\n            one. The cry of the collective for justice, its desire\n            for peace and harmony and its necessity for\n            security cannot be allowed to be trivialised. The\n            life of an individual living in a society governed\n            by the rule of law has to be regulated and such\n            regulations which are the source in law subserve\n            the social balance and function as a significant\n            instrument for protection of human rights and\n            security of the collective. It is because\n            fundamentally laws are made for their obedience\n            so that every member of the society lives\n            peacefully in a society to achieve his individual as\n            well as social interest.

Essentially, this Court is required to\n             analyse whether there was a valid exercise of the\n             power conferred by <a href=\"/doc/1290514/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 439</a> CrPC to grant\n             bail. The power to grant bail under Section 439 is\n             of a wide amplitude. But it is well settled that\n             though the grant of bail involves the exercise of\n             the discretionary power of the court, it has to be\n             exercised in a judicious manner and not as a\n             matter of course. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"836557\" id=\"span_20\">In <a href=\"/doc/836557/\" id=\"a_43\">Ram Govind Upadhyay v.\n             Sudarshan Singh</a> (2002) 3 SCC 598, Umesh\n             Banerjee, J. speaking for a two-Judge Bench of\n             this Court, laid down the factors that must guide\n             the exercise of the power to grant bail in the\n             following terms:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                        &quot;3.

Needless to record, however, that\n                 the grant of bail is dependent upon the\n                 contextual facts of the matter being dealt with\n                 by the court and facts, however, do always\n                 vary from case to case. ...

However, it is equally incumbent\n              upon the High Court to exercise its discretion\n              judiciously, cautiously and strictly in\n              compliance with the basic principles laid down\n              in a plethora of decisions of this Court on the\n              point. It is well settled that, among other\n              circumstances, the factors to be borne in mind\n              while considering an application for bail are:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">                        (i)    whether there is any prima facie\n                 or reasonable ground to believe that the\n                 accused had committed the offence;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">                        (ii) nature and gravity of the\n                 accusation;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">                        (iii) severity of the punishment in\n                 the event of conviction;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">                        (iv) danger       of     the    accused\n                 absconding or fleeing, if released on bail;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">                        (v) character, behaviour, means,\n                 position and standing of the accused;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                        (vi) likelihood of the offence being\n                 repeated;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">                        (vii) reasonable apprehension of the\n                 witnesses being influenced; and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">                        (viii) danger, of course, of justice\n                 being thwarted by grant of bail.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">                    10.

The provision for an accused to be\n           released on bail touches upon the liberty of an\n           individual. It is for this reason that this Court does\n           not ordinarily interfere with an order of the High\n           Court granting bail. However, where the\n           discretion of the High Court to grant bail has been\n           exercised without the due application of mind or\n           in contravention of the directions of this Court,\n           such an order granting bail is liable to be set\n           aside. The Court is required to factor, amongst\n           other things, a prima facie view that the accused\n           had committed the offence, the nature and gravity\n           of the offence and the likelihood of the accused\n           obstructing the proceedings of the trial in any\n           manner or evading the course of justice. The\n           provision for being released on bail draws an\n           appropriate balance between public interest in the\n           administration of justice and the protection of\n           individual liberty pending adjudication of the\n           case. However, the grant of bail is to be secured\n           within the bounds of the law and in compliance\n           with the conditions <a href=\"/doc/7447/\" id=\"a_49\">laid down by</a> this Court. It is\n           for this reason that a court must balance numerous\n           factors that guide the exercise of the discretionary\n           power to grant bail on a case by-case basis.\n           Inherent in this determination is whether, on an\n           analysis of the record, it appears that there is a\n           prima facie or reasonable cause to believe that the\n           accused had committed the crime. It is not\n           relevant at this stage for the court to examine in\n           detail the evidence on record to come to a\n           conclusive finding.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7447\" id=\"span_27\">16. The considerations that guide the power\n           of an appellate court in assessing the correctness\n           of an order granting bail stand on a different\n           footing from an assessment of an application for\n           the cancellation of bail. The correctness of an\n           order granting bail is tested on the anvil of\n           whether there was an improper or arbitrary\n           exercise of the discretion in the grant of bail. The\n           test is whether the order granting bail is perverse,\n           illegal or unjustified.

If in a case, the relevant factors which\n              should have been taken into consideration\n              while dealing with the application for bail have\n              not been taken note of, or bail is founded on\n              irrelevant considerations, indisputably the\n              superior court can set aside the order of such a\n              grant of bail. Such a case belongs to a different\n              category and is in a separate realm. While\n              dealing with a case of second nature, the Court\n              does not dwell upon the violation of conditions\n              by the accused or the supervening\n              circumstances        that      have      happened\n              subsequently. It, on the contrary, delves into the\n              justifiability and the soundness of the order\n              passed by the Court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">                  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7447\" id=\"span_31\">17. Where a court considering an\n           application for bail fails to consider relevant\n           factors, an appellate court may justifiably set\n           aside the order granting bail. An appellate court is\n           thus required to consider whether the order\n           granting bail suffers from a non-application of\n           mind or is not borne out from a prima facie view\n           of the evidence on record.

The first aspect of the case which stares\n           in the face is the singular absence in the judgment of\n           the High Court to the nature and gravity of the\n           crime. The incident which took place on 9 May\n           2020 resulted in five homicidal deaths. The nature\n           of the offence is a circumstance which has an\n           important bearing on the grant of bail. The orders of\n           the High Court are conspicuous in the absence of\n           any awareness or elaboration of the serious nature\n           of the offence. The perversity lies in the failure of\n           the High Court to consider an important\n           circumstance which has a bearing on whether bail\n           should be granted. In the two-judge Bench decision\n           of this Court in Ram Govind Upadhyay v.\n           Sudharshan Singh, the nature of the crime was\n           recorded as &quot;one of the basic considerations&quot; which\n           has a bearing on the grant or denial of bail. The\n           considerations which govern the grant of bail were\n           elucidated in the judgment of this Court without\n           attaching an exhaustive nature or character to them.\n           This emerges from the following extract:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">                    &quot;4.

The recording of\n         reasons in a judicial order ensures that the thought\n         process underlying the order is subject to scrutiny\n         and that it meets objective standards of reason and\n         justice.

Even on a cursory perusal the High\n                 Court&#x27;s order shows complete non-application of\n                 mind. Though detailed examination of the\n                 evidence and elaborate documentation of the\n                 merits of the case is to be avoided by the Court\n                 while passing orders on bail applications. Yet a\n                 court dealing with the bail application should be\n                 satisfied, as to whether there is a prima facie case,\n                 but exhaustive exploration of the merits of the\n                 case is not necessary. The court dealing with the\n                 application for bail is required to exercise its\n                 discretion in a judicious manner and not as a\n                 matter of course.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">                        9.

The High\n               Court sought to support its decision to grant bail by\n               stating that it had perused the material on record and\n               was granting bail &quot;without discussing the evidence\n               in detail&quot; taking into consideration:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">                      (1) The facts of the case;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">                      (2) The nature of allegations;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">                      (3) Gravity of offences; and\n                      (4) Role attributed to the accused.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"7447\" id=\"span_42\">21.        Thus, the nature and gravity of accusation, whether there is any\n\nprima facie or reasonable ground to believe that the accused had\n\ncommitted the offence, likelihood of offence being repeated, danger\n\nof accused absconding or fleeing, character behaviour, position and\n\nstanding of accused, reasonable apprehension of witness being\n\ninfluenced and danger, and of justice being thwarted by grant of bail\n       31 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                Criminal Appeal No.5870/2021\nSikandar Singh Narvariya alias <a href=\"/doc/7447/\" id=\"a_68\">Lalu Vs.
