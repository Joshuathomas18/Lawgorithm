It is, however, imperative for the present controversy,\n\nthat the appellant overcomes the legal position declared by this\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">\f                                             8</span>\n\nCourt,    as    well   as,     the   provisions          of   the        <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_37\">Code       of    Criminal\n\nProcedure</a>.
