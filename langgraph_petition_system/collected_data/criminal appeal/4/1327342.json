The appellant is a well known actress who has approached\n\nthis Court to seek quashing of criminal proceedings pending\n\nagainst her. As many as 23 Criminal Complaints were filed\n\nagainst her, mostly in the State of Tamil Nadu, for the\n\noffences contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_1\">Sections 499</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_2\">500</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1198526/\" id=\"a_3\">505</a> of\n\nthe    Indian     Penal     Code,        1860           [hereinafter       `<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_4\">IPC</a>&#x27;]       and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/124708675/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 4</a> and <a href=\"/doc/45559669/\" id=\"a_6\">6</a> of the Indecent Representation of Women\n\n(Prohibition)       Act,       1986       [hereinafter            `Act    1986&#x27;].       The\n\ntrigger    for     the     same       were       some      remarks       made    by     the\n\nappellant in an interview to a leading news magazine and\n\nlater on the same issue was reported in a distorted manner\n\nin     another    periodical.            Faced      with      the    predicament        of\n\ncontesting the criminal proceedings instituted against her\n\nin several locations, the appellant had approached the High\n\nCourt     of     Madras,       praying        for       the   quashing      of        these\n\nproceedings       through      the       exercise        of   its     inherent        power\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 482</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure, 1973\n\n[hereinafter `<a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_8\">Cr.PC</a>.&#x27;]. The High Court rejected her plea\n\nvide impugned judgment and order dated 30.4.2008. At the\n\nsame    time,     in     order      to     prevent         the      inconvenience        of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                                                                        2</span>\n\flitigating       the   same   subject-matter          in    multiple   locations\n\ndirected     that      all    the       cases      instituted     against       the\n\nappellant be consolidated and tried together by the Chief\n\nMetropolitan Magistrate, Egmore (Chennai). Aggrieved by the\n\naforesaid judgment,           the appellant approached this Court by\n\nway of a batch of Special Leave Petitions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">3. Before addressing the legal aspects of the case before\n\nus, it would be useful to examine the relevant facts. In\n\nSeptember 2005, `India Today&#x27; a fortnightly news magazine\n\nhad conducted a survey on the subject of the sexual habits\n\nof people residing in the bigger cities of India. One of\n\nthe   issues      discussed        as    part   of    this    survey     was    the\n\nincreasing incidence of pre-marital sex. As a part of this\n\nexercise, the magazine had gathered and published the views\n\nexpressed by several individuals from different segments of\n\nsociety, including those of the appellant. The appellant\n\nexpressed her personal opinion wherein she had noted the\n\nincreasing incidence of pre-marital sex, especially in the\n\ncontext     of    live-in      relationships          and     called     for    the\n\nsocietal    acceptance        of    the   same.      However,    appellant      had\n\nalso qualified her remarks by observing that girls should\n\ntake adequate precautions to prevent unwanted pregnancies\n\nand   the   transmission       of       venereal     diseases.    This    can    be\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                                                                3</span>\n\freadily inferred from the statement which was published, a\n\nrough translation of which is reproduced below:\n\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     &quot;According to me, sex is not only concerned with\n     the body; but also concerned with the conscious.\n     I could not understand matters such as changing\n     boyfriends every week. When a girl is committed\n     to   her boyfriend, she can tell her parents and\n     go out with him. When their daughter is having a\n     serious relationship, the parents should allow\n     the same. Our society should come out of the\n     thinking that at the time of the marriage, the\n     girls should be with virginity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     None of the educated men, will expect that the\n     girl whom they are marrying should be with\n     virginity. But when having sexual relationship\n     the   girls   should   protect   themselves from\n     conceiving and getting venereal diseases.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">These   remarks   were   published   alongside    a   survey,   the\n\nrelevant extracts of which are stated below:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     &quot;Will you marry a      person   who   had   relationship\n     with    others?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">     18% - Yes, 71% - No\n\n     Is it necessary to be a virgin till the time of\nmarriage?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">     65% - Yes, 26% - No\n\n     The remaining percentage of people said: Do not\n     know/Cannot say\n\n     82% women had given an opinion that a girl should\n     be a virgin at the time of marriage.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">4. Subsequently, `Dhina Thanthi&#x27;, a Tamil daily carried a\n\nnews item on 24.9.2005 which first quoted the appellant&#x27;s\n\nstatement published in `India Today&#x27; and then opined that\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                                                4</span>\n\fit had created a sensation all over the State of Tamil\n\nNadu. This news item also reported a conversation between\n\nthe    appellant     and   a   correspondent    from    `Dhina   Thanthi&#x27;,\n\nwherein the appellant had purportedly defended her views in\n\nthe following manner (rough translation reproduced below):\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">       &quot;The persons who are protesting against my\n       interview, are talking about which culture? Is\n       there anyone who does not know about sex in Tamil\n       Nadu? Is there anyone who does not know about\n       AIDS? How many men and women do not have sex\n       before marriage?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">       Why are people saying that after the marriage the\n       husband and wife should be honest and faithful to\n       each other? One should have confidence in the\n       other, only to avoid the mistakes from being\n       committed. If the husband, without the knowledge\n       of the wife, or the wife, without the knowledge\n       of the husband, have sex with other persons, if a\n       disease is caused through that, the same will\n       affect both the persons. It will also affect the\n       children. Only because of this, they are saying\n       like that.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">However, soon after the publication of the above mentioned\n\nnews   item,   the    appellant    had   sent   a     legal   notice    dated\n\n2.10.2005 to the Editor of `Dhina Thanthi&#x27;, categorically\n\ndenying that she had made the statement quoted above. In\n\nfact, the appellant had asked the publisher to withdraw the\n\nnews-item      carried     on    24.9.2005      and     to    publish    her\n\nobjections prominently within three days of receipt of the\n\nnotice, failing which the appellant would be constrained to\n\ntake appropriate legal action against the newspaper.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                          5</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">\f5. As outlined above, the publication of these statements\n\nin `India Today&#x27; and `Dhina Thanthi&#x27; drew criticism from\n\nsome quarters and several persons and organisations filed\n\ncriminal   complaints      against     the    appellant.     For     instance,\n\nthe complainant in the appeal arising out of SLP (Crl) No.\n\n4010 of 2008 has stated that she is a married woman who is\n\nthe Treasurer of a District-level unit of the Pattali Makal\n\nKatchi [hereinafter `PMK&#x27;], a political party, and is also\n\ninvolved in social service. She had quoted some parts of\n\nthe   statements    published        in     `India    Today&#x27;     and    `Dhina\n\nThanthi&#x27;   to    allege    that    the       appellant&#x27;s    interview       had\n\nbrought great      shame   on    her   since     it   had   suggested      that\n\nwomen of her profile had engaged in premarital sex. The\n\ncomplainant     further    alleged     that    the    appellant&#x27;s       remarks\n\nhad caused mental harassment to a large section of women,\n\nand in particular women from Tamil Nadu were being looked\n\ndown upon with disrespect and contempt.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">6. In the appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) 4764 of 2008,\n\nthe   complainant    is    a    male      advocate    who   is   a     District\n\nSecretary of the PMK for Salem District. In his complaint,\n\nthere is no direct reference to the news-item published in\n\n`Dhina Thanthi&#x27; on 24.9.2005. Instead the complainant has\n\nstated that he found second-hand accounts of the same to be\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                            6</span>\n\fquite shocking since the appellant had questioned the need\n\nfor women to maintain their virginity or chastity. It was\n\nalleged      that    these     remarks      were    an     abuse    against      the\n\ndignity      of    the   Tamil    women     and     that    they    had    grossly\n\naffected and ruined the culture and morality of the people\n\nof     the   State.       It   was    further       submitted       that      these\n\nstatements could persuade people to involve themselves in\n\nunnatural crimes and that the appellant&#x27;s acts amounted to\n\ncommission of offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_9\">Sections 499</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_10\">500</a>,\n\n<a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_11\">504</a>, <a href=\"/doc/360749/\" id=\"a_12\">505(1)(b)</a>           and <a href=\"/doc/68146/\" id=\"a_13\">509</a> IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/96293110/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/124708675/\" id=\"a_15\">4</a> of\n\nAct    1986.      Similarly,     in   the   appeal        arising   out     of   SLP\n\n(Crl.) 6127 of 2008, the complainant is a lady advocate who\n\nhas been practicing in the Trichy District Courts for more\n\nthan    10     years.    She   has    quoted       some    portions       from   the\n\nstatements published in `India Today&#x27; and `Dhina Thanthi&#x27;\n\nto submit that the appellant&#x27;s acts were punishable under\n\nSections 292, 500, 504, 505(1)(b) and (c), 505(2) and 509\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_16\">IPC</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/45559669/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 6</a> of            Act 1986.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">7. Likewise, in the appeal arising out of SLP (Crl.) 6259\n\nof 2008, the complainant has stated that she is a married\n\nwoman belonging to a reputed family and that she is serving\n\nas the President of the District Magalir Association of the\n\nPMK (in Thiruvarur) and rendering social service. In her\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                                 7</span>\n\fcomplaint, some parts of the appellant&#x27;s statements have\n\nbeen quoted to allege that she had suffered great mental\n\nagony and shame since it was suggested that all women in\n\nTamil Nadu had lost their virginity before marriage. In\n\nthis    respect,       the    complainant    has        alleged       that     the\n\nappellant had committed offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_18\">Sections\n\n499</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1408202/\" id=\"a_19\">500</a>, <a href=\"/doc/555306/\" id=\"a_20\">504</a>, <a href=\"/doc/360749/\" id=\"a_21\">505(1)(b)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/68146/\" id=\"a_22\">509</a>                 IPC read with <a href=\"/doc/45559669/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 6</a>\n\nof Act 1986. It is noteworthy that in most of the other\n\ncases     filed   in    various      districts     of    Tamil        Nadu,    the\n\ncomplainants      are    functionaries      of    the    PMK     and     similar\n\nallegations have been levelled against the appellant. Oddly\n\nenough,    one    of    the   complaints    had    even        been    filed    in\n\nIndore, Madhya Pradesh.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">8. As mentioned earlier, the appellant approached the High\n\nCourt   of   Madras      to   seek   quashing     of     all    the     criminal\n\nproceedings instituted against her in this connection. In\n\nits judgment dated 30.4.2008, the High Court                          refused to\n\nquash the proceedings by              exercising its inherent powers\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1679850/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 482</a> Cr.PC, on the premise that the relevant\n\nconsiderations in this case were questions of fact which\n\nwere best left to be determined by a trial judge. The High\n\nCourt     noted that two basic questions were involved in the\n\ncase. Firstly, whether the appellant could claim any of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                               8</span>\n\frecognised       defences        against      the     allegations         of    having\n\ncommitted defamation, as contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 499</a>                                 IPC.\n\nSecondly,     whether        the       complainants       could       at       all    be\n\ndescribed     as    `aggrieved         persons&#x27;       within    the       meaning     of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/27007/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 199</a> Cr.PC since that was linked to the question of\n\nwhether the complaints had been made in a bona fide manner.\n\nThe High Court thought it fit to leave both these questions\n\nfor   consideration         by    a    trial    judge,    and     in      a    partial\n\nreprieve    to     the    appellant      it    was    directed       that      all   the\n\ncriminal    proceedings          pending      against    her    be    consolidated\n\nand tried by the Chief Metropolitan Magistrate at Egmore,\n\nChennai. However, the High Court also proceeded to record\n\nits own views regarding the contents of the appellant&#x27;s\n\nstatements       and      even        made     some     strong        observations\n\ncondemning       the     incidence      of    premarital       sex    and      live-in\n\nrelationships.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_17\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">9.

Her\n\nstatement would definitely obscure some basic moral values\n\nand expose young people to bizarre ideas about premarital\n\nsex,    thereby        leading       to    deviant         behaviour         which       would\n\nadversely      affect        public        notions         of     morality.         It    was\n\ncontended that the constitutional protection for speech and\n\nexpression        is   not     absolute         and    that       it    is    subject      to\n\nreasonable restrictions based on considerations of `public\n\norder&#x27;, `defamation&#x27;,               `decency         and    morality&#x27;        among       other\n\ngrounds.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">11.

Where the allegations made in the First\n       Information Report or the complaint, even if they\n       are taken at their face value and accepted in\n       their entirety do not prima facie constitute any\n       offence or make out a case against the accused.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">       ... (7). Where a criminal proceeding is manifestly\n       attended    with  mala   fide  and/or  where   the\n       proceeding is maliciously instituted with an\n       ulterior motive for wreaking vengeance on the\n       accused and with a view to spite him due to\n       private and personal grudge.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"279427\" id=\"span_13\">13. It is of course a settled legal proposition that in a\n\ncase    where    there    is     sufficient     evidence    against      the\n\naccused, which may establish the charge against him/her,\n\nthe proceedings cannot be quashed. In M/s Medchl Chemicals\n\n&amp; Pharma Ltd. Vs. M/s Biological E. Ltd. &amp; Ors., AIR 2000\n\nSC 1869, this Court observed that a criminal complaint or a\n\ncharge sheet     can     only   be    quashed   by   superior   courts    in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                         12</span>\n\fexceptional circumstances, such as when the allegations in\n\na    complaint    do    not   support        a    prima   facie    case    for   an\n\noffence. Similarly, in M/s <a href=\"/doc/279427/\" id=\"a_36\">Zandu Pharmaceutical Works Ltd.\n\n&amp; Ors. Vs. Mohd. Sharaful Haque &amp; Ors.</a>, AIR 2005 SC 9, this\n\nCourt has held that criminal proceedings can be quashed but\n\nsuch a power is to be exercised sparingly and only when\n\nsuch an exercise is justified by the tests that have been\n\nspecifically       <a href=\"/doc/279427/\" id=\"a_37\">laid       down     in</a>        the   statutory        provisions\n\nthemselves. It was further observed that superior courts\n\n&quot;may examine the questions of fact&quot; when the use of the\n\ncriminal law machinery could be in the nature of an abuse\n\nof    authority    or    when   it     could       result   in    injustice.</span>      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"437533\" id=\"span_15\">In\n\n<a href=\"/doc/437533/\" id=\"a_38\">Shakson Belthissor Vs.

In fact it was observed:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       &quot;One of the paramount duties of the superior\n       courts is to see that a person who is apparently\n       innocent is not subjected to prosecution and\n       humiliation on the basis of a false and wholly\n       untenable complaint.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">14. There can be no quarrel about this Court&#x27;s competence\n\nto     quash      criminal      proceedings            pending     before        the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                                                 13</span>\n\fsubordinate courts. However, this power must be exercised\n\nsparingly and with circumspection. In light of the position\n\nsummarized above, we can examine the present case with two\n\nconsiderations in mind, namely whether the allegations made\n\nagainst the appellant support a prima facie case for the\n\noffences    mentioned     in   the     respective      complaints,       and\n\nwhether the complaints were made in a bona fide manner.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">15. Perusal    of   the   complaints     reveals    that     most   of   the\n\nallegations have pertained to offences such as defamation\n\n(<a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_39\">Sections 499</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1820068/\" id=\"a_40\">501</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1495647/\" id=\"a_41\">502</a> IPC), obscenity (<a href=\"/doc/1704109/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 292</a>\n\nIPC), indecent representation of women and incitement among\n\nothers. At the outset, we are of the view that there is\n\nabsolutely no basis for proceeding against the appellant in\n\nrespect of some of the alleged offences. For example, the\n\nAct, 1986 was enacted to punish publishers and advertisers\n\nwho knowingly disseminate materials that portray women in\n\nan indecent manner. However, this statute cannot be used in\n\nthe present case where the appellant has merely referred to\n\nthe incidence of pre-marital sex in her statement which was\n\npublished by a news magazine and subsequently reported in\n\nanother    periodical.    It   would    defy   logic    to    invoke     the\n\noffences mentioned in this statute to proceed against the\n\nappellant, who cannot be described as an `advertiser&#x27; or\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                         14</span>\n\f`publisher&#x27;      by    any    means.      Similarly,     <a href=\"/doc/68146/\" id=\"a_43\">Section   509</a>   IPC\n\ncriminalises a `word, gesture or act intended to insult the\n\nmodesty of a woman&#x27; and in order to establish this offence\n\nit is necessary to show that the modesty of a particular\n\nwoman or a readily identifiable group of women has been\n\ninsulted by a spoken word, gesture or physical act. Clearly\n\nthis   offence    cannot      be   made    out   when    the   complainants&#x27;\n\ngrievance is with the publication of what the appellant had\n\nstated in a written form. Likewise, some of the complaints\n\nhave    mentioned      offences     such    as   those    contemplated    by\n\n<a href=\"/doc/345634/\" id=\"a_44\">Section    153A</a>       IPC    (`Promoting     enmity     between    different\n\ngroups etc.,&#x27;) which have no application to the present\n\ncase since the appellant was not speaking on behalf of one\n\ngroup and the content of her statement was not directed\n\nagainst any particular group either.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">16. Coming to the substance of the complaints, we fail to\n\nsee how the appellant&#x27;s remarks amount to `obscenity&#x27; in\n\nthe context of <a href=\"/doc/1704109/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 292</a> IPC. Clause (1) to Section 292\n\nstates that the publication of a book, pamphlet, paper,\n\nwriting, drawing, painting, representation, figure, etc.,\n\nwill be deemed obscene, if -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">  7    It is lascivious (i.e. expressing or causing sexual\n       desire) or\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                                                         15</span>\n\f  7    Appeals    to     the       prurient   interest     (i.e.     excessive\n       interest in sexual matters), or\n  7    If its effect, or the effect of any one of the items,\n       tends to deprave and corrupt persons, who are likely\n       to read, see, or hear the matter contained in such\n       materials.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1623275\" id=\"span_19\">In the past, authors as well as publishers of artistic and\n\nliterary works have been put to trial and punished under\n\nthis section.

It would be apt to\n\nrefer   back     to   the    decision    of     this    Court   in   <a href=\"/doc/1623275/\" id=\"a_46\">Ranjit   D.\n\nUdeshi Vs. State of Maharashtra</a>, AIR 1965 SC 881, wherein\n\nit was held that if a mere reference to sex by itself is\n\nconsidered obscene, no books can be sold except those which\n\nare purely religious. It was observed that in the field of\n\nart and cinema, the adolescent is shown situations which\n\neven    a   quarter     of     a    century   ago      would    be   considered\n\nderogatory to public morality, but having regard to changed\n\nconditions, the same are taken for granted without in any\n\nway tending to debase or debauch the mind. What is to be\n\nconsidered is whether a class of persons, not an isolated\n\ncase, into whose hands the book, article or story falls\n\nwill suffer in their moral outlook or become depraved by\n\nreading     it   or    might   have     impure    and    lecherous    thoughts\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                              16</span>\n\faroused in their minds.

In the present case,\n\nthe       appellant       has    merely      referred       to     the    increasing\n\nincidence of pre-marital sex and called for its societal\n\nacceptance.

Even though this\n\nsurvey was not part of a literary or artistic work, it was\n\npublished in a news magazine thereby serving the purpose of\n\ncommunicating         certain        ideas    and    opinions       on    the   above-\n\nmentioned      subject.         In    the    long    run,    such    communication\n\nprompts a dialogue within society wherein people can choose\n\nto either defend or question the existing social mores. It\n\nis difficult to appreciate the claim that the statements\n\npublished      as     part      of   the    survey   were    in     the    nature   of\n\nobscene communications.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">19. We must also respond to the claim that the appellant&#x27;s\n\nremarks could have the effect of misguiding young people by\n\nencouraging them to indulge in premarital sex. This claim\n\nis    a    little        far-fetched        since    the    appellant       had     not\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                                                    18</span>\n\fdirected her remarks towards any individual or group in\n\nparticular.     All    that    the    appellant      did     was     to    urge    the\n\nsocietal     acceptance        of      the     increasing          instances        of\n\npremarital sex when both partners are committed to each\n\nother. This cannot be construed as an open endorsement of\n\nsexual activities of all kinds. If it were to be considered\n\nso, the criminal law machinery would have to take on the\n\nunenforceable task of punishing all writers, journalists or\n\nother   such      persons     for    merely       referring    to     any     matter\n\nconnected with sex in published materials. For the sake of\n\nargument,      even    if     it     were     to    be     assumed        that     the\n\nappellant&#x27;s       statements        could    encourage        some        people    to\n\nengage in premarital sex, no legal injury has been shown\n\nsince the latter is not an offence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">20.   &quot;Offence&quot;       means   `an    act     or    instance    of     offending&#x27;;\n\n`commit an illegal act&#x27; and illegal means, `contrary to or\n\nforbidden by law&#x27;.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">      &quot;Offence&quot; has to be read and understood in the context\n\nas it has been prescribed under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/886402/\" id=\"a_49\">Sections\n\n40</a>, <a href=\"/doc/170198/\" id=\"a_50\">41</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1083970/\" id=\"a_51\">42</a> IPC which cover the offences punishable under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_52\">I.P.C</a>. or under special or local law or as defined under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1879701/\" id=\"a_53\">Section    2(n)</a>    Cr.P.C.     or      <a href=\"/doc/122095822/\" id=\"a_54\">Section       3(38)</a>    of     the    General\n\nClauses     Act,      1897     (vide        Proprietary       Articles           Trade\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                                   19</span>\n\fAssociation Vs.

It would also be instructive to refer to a decision of\n\nthe House of Lords (U.K.) in Gillick Vs. West Norfolk and\n\nWisbech Area Health Authority, (1985) 3 All ER 402. In that\n\ncase, mother of a teenage girl had questioned the decision\n\nof the National Health Service (NHS) to issue a circular to\n\nlocal area     health     authorities      which   contained   guidelines\n\nfor rendering advice about contraceptive methods to girls\n\nunder the age of 16 years. Objections were raised against\n\nthis     circular    on   the     ground   that    the   health   service\n\nauthorities had no competence to render such advice and\n\nthat doing so could adversely affect young children while\n\nat the same time interfering with parental autonomy in the\n\nmatter    of   bringing     up    children.    The   majority     decision\n\nrejected the challenge against the circular by clarifying\n\nthat the rendering of advice about contraceptive methods\n\nand their provision by medical professionals did not amount\n\nto a sexual offence. Among the several aspects discussed in\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                                       21</span>\n\fthat case, it was held that the provision of information\n\nabout contraceptive facilities to girls under the age of 16\n\nyears     could    not     be    opposed     on        the   ground       that    such\n\ninformation        could        potentially        encourage         more        sexual\n\nactivity by the teenagers. For the purpose of the present\n\ncase, this decision supports the reasoning that we must\n\nfully   understand        the    context     and       the   purpose      for     which\n\nreferences to sex have been made in any given setting.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">23. We now turn to the question whether the appellant&#x27;s\n\nremarks could reasonably amount to offence of defamation as\n\ndefined under <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 499</a> IPC.                    In the impugned judgment\n\ndated 30.4.2008, the High Court observed that as to whether\n\nthe appellant could claim a defence against the allegations\n\nof defamation was a factual question and thus would                                 be\n\ndecided by a trial Court.                 However, even before examining\n\nwhether    the     appellant       can     claim       any   of     the    statutory\n\ndefences in this regard, the operative question is whether\n\nthe allegations in the impugned complaints support a prima\n\nfacie case of defamation in the first place. It is our\n\nconsidered    view       that     there    is     no    prima     facie     case    of\n\ndefamation    in    the    present        case.    This      will    become      self-\n\nevident if we draw attention to the key ingredients of the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                                                    22</span>\n\foffence contemplated by <a href=\"/doc/1041742/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 499</a> IPC, which reads as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     &quot;499.

Explanation 2 to Section 499 further states that `It\n\nmay amount to defamation to make an imputation concerning a\n\ncompany    or   an    association     or    collection        of   persons    as\n\nsuch.&#x27;\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">24. With regard to the complaints in question, there is\n\nneither any intent on part of the appellant to cause harm\n\nto the reputation of the complainants nor can we discern\n\nany actual harm done to their reputation. In short, both\n\nthe elements i.e. mens rea and actus reus are missing. As\n\nmentioned earlier, the appellant&#x27;s statement published in\n\n`India    Today&#x27;      (in   September    2005)    is    a    rather    general\n\nendorsement      of    premarital     sex   and   her       remarks    are   not\n\ndirected at any individual or even at a `company or an\n\nassociation or collection of persons&#x27;. It is difficult to\n\nfathom how the appellant&#x27;s views can be construed as an\n\nattack on the reputation of anyone in particular. Even if\n\nwe refer to the remarks published in `Dhina Thanthi&#x27; (dated\n\n24.9.2005)      which   have   been     categorically         denied   by    the\n\nappellant, there is no direct attack on the reputation of\n\nanyone in particular. Instead, the purported remarks are in\n\nthe nature of rhetorical questions wherein it was asked if\n\npeople in Tamil Nadu were not aware of the incidence of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                                                             24</span>\n\fsex. Even if we consider these remarks in their entirety,\n\nnowhere has it been suggested that all women in Tamil Nadu\n\nhave engaged in premarital sex. That imputation can only be\n\nfound in       the   complaints    that   were    filed    by   the   various\n\nrespondents. It is a clear case of the complainants reading\n\nin too much into the appellant&#x27;s remarks.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">25. This takes us to the question of whether the impugned\n\ncomplaints were made in a bona fide manner. As we have\n\nalready noted, most of the complainants are associated with\n\nthe PMK, a political party which is active in the State of\n\nTamil Nadu. This fact does add weight to the suggestion\n\nthat    the    impugned     complaints    have    been     filed   with   the\n\nintention of gaining undue political mileage. It may be\n\nreiterated       here     that    in   respect    of      the   offence   of\n\ndefamation, <a href=\"/doc/27007/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 199</a> Cr.PC mandates that the Magistrate\n\ncan take cognizance of the offence only upon receiving a\n\ncomplaint by a person who is aggrieved. This limitation on\n\nthe    power    to   take   cognizance     of    defamation      serves   the\n\nrational purpose of discouraging the filing of frivolous\n\ncomplaints      which     would   otherwise      clog     the   Magistrate&#x27;s\n\nCourts. There is of course some room for complaints to be\n\nbrought by persons other than those who are aggrieved, for\n\ninstance when the aggrieved person has passed away or is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                                          25</span>\n\fotherwise unable to initiate legal proceedings. However, in\n\ngiven facts of the present case, we are unable to see how\n\nthe   complainants   can    be   properly     described   as   `persons\n\naggrieved&#x27; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/1265544/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 199(1)(b)</a>               Cr.PC.\n\nAs explained earlier, there was no specific legal injury\n\ncaused to any of the complainants since the appellant&#x27;s\n\nremarks were not directed at any individual or a readily\n\nidentifiable    group      of    people.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1919476\" id=\"span_35\">In   <a href=\"/doc/1919476/\" id=\"a_66\">M.S.

Like      the    present     case,   the\n\nCourt    had   to     consider       whether   the     complainant       had    the\n\nproper legal standing to bring such a complaint. The Court\n\ndid examine <a href=\"/doc/854390/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 198</a> of the Code of Criminal Procedure,\n\n1898    (analogous     to     <a href=\"/doc/27007/\" id=\"a_73\">Section    199</a>   of     the    Cr.PC.     1973)   and\n\nobserved that the said provision laid down an exception to\n\nthe general rule that a criminal complaint can be filed by\n\nanyone irrespective of whether he is an &quot;aggrieved person&quot;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">or not.    But there is a departure from this norm in so far\n\nas the provision permits only an &quot;aggrieved person&quot; to move\n\nthe Court in case of defamation. This section is mandatory\n\nand it is a settled legal proposition that if a Magistrate\n\nwere to take cognizance of the offence of defamation on a\n\ncomplaint filed by one who is not an &quot;aggrieved person&quot;,\n\nthe trial and conviction of an accused in such a case by\n\nthe    Magistrate      would     be     void   and     illegal.       This   Court\n\nfurther    noted      that     the     news-item      in     question    did    not\n\nmention    any      individual        person   nor     did    it   contain      any\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                                                                27</span>\n\fdefamatory imputation against any individual.

In case the identity of the collection of persons\n\nis not established so as to be relatable to the defamatory\n\nwords or imputations, the complaint is not maintainable. In\n\ncase a class is mentioned, if such a class is indefinite,\n\nthe complaint cannot be entertained. Furthermore, if it is\n\nnot possible to ascertain the composition of such a class,\n\nthe criminal prosecution cannot proceed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       While deciding the case, this Court placed reliance on\n\nthe judgment of the House of Lords in Knupffer Vs. London\n\nExpress Newspaper Ltd. (1944) 1 ALL ER 495, wherein it had\n\nbeen held that it is an essential element of the cause of\n\naction for defamation that the words complained of should\n\nbe published &quot;of the complainant/plaintiff&quot;.                            Where he is\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                                                      28</span>\n\fnot   named,    the     test    would       be    whether         the    words       would\n\nreasonably      lead        people     acquainted            with       him     to    the\n\nconclusion that he was the person referred to.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">      In fact, it is the reputation of an individual person\n\nwhich must be in question and only such a person can claim\n\nto have &quot;a legal peg for a justifiable claim to hang on&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">27.   Coming    back    to     the   facts       of    the    present         case,   the\n\ncomplainants         have     alleged       defamation            in     respect       of\n\nimputations against the character of Tamil-speaking women,\n\nwhich   could    perhaps       be    viewed       as    a    class       of    persons.\n\nHowever,        we     have    already       explained,           the     appellant&#x27;s\n\nremarks did not suggest that all women in Tamil Nadu have\n\nengaged in premarital sex. In fact her statement in `India\n\nToday&#x27; did not refer to any specific individual or group at\n\nall. If we refer to one of the questions asked as part of\n\nthe concerned survey, one of the answers shows that 26% of\n\nthe people who responded to the same did not think that it\n\nwas necessary for women to retain their virginity till the\n\ntime of marriage. Clearly the appellant was not alone in\n\nexpressing such a view, even though it may be unpopular or\n\ncontrary to the mainstream social practices. Even if it\n\nwere assumed that the news-item carried in `Dhina Thanthi&#x27;\n\ncaused mental        agony     to    some   sections         of     women      in    Tamil\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                                                                       29</span>\n\fNadu, there is no prima facie case for any offence. What is\n\ninteresting to note is that not all of the complainants are\n\nwomen,    and     in     fact   almost     all       the    complainants     are\n\nassociated with a particular political party.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_53\">28. We are of the view that the institution of the numerous\n\ncriminal complaints against the appellant was done in a\n\nmala fide manner. In order to prevent the abuse of the\n\ncriminal law machinery, we are therefore inclined to grant\n\nthe relief      sought     by   the    appellant.      In   such    cases,   the\n\nproper course for Magistrates is to use their statutory\n\npowers    to    direct    an    investigation        into    the   allegations\n\nbefore taking cognizance of the offences alleged. It is not\n\nthe task of the criminal law to punish individuals merely\n\nfor expressing unpopular views. The threshold for placing\n\nreasonable      restrictions      on     the   `freedom       of   speech    and\n\nexpression&#x27; is indeed a very high one and there should be a\n\npresumption in favour of the accused in such cases. It is\n\nonly when the complainants produce materials that support a\n\nprima facie case for a statutory offence that Magistrates\n\ncan proceed to take cognizance of the same. We must be\n\nmindful    that    the    initiation      of     a   criminal      trial    is   a\n\nprocess which carries an implicit degree of coercion and it\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                                             30</span>\n\fshould not be triggered by false and frivolous complaints,\n\namounting to harassment and humiliation to the accused.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">29. Even though the constitutional freedom of speech and\n\nexpression     is    not   absolute    and        can    be        subjected    to\n\nreasonable     restrictions    on   grounds       such    as       `decency     and\n\nmorality&#x27; among others, we must lay stress on the need to\n\ntolerate unpopular views in the socio-cultural space. The\n\nframers of our Constitution recognised the importance of\n\nsafeguarding this right since the free flow of opinions and\n\nideas is essential to sustain the collective life of the\n\ncitizenry. While an informed citizenry is a pre-condition\n\nfor meaningful governance in the political sense, we must\n\nalso promote a culture of open dialogue when it comes to\n\nsocietal attitudes. Admittedly, the appellant&#x27;s remarks did\n\nprovoke a controversy since the acceptance of premarital\n\nsex   and   live-in    relationships      is   viewed         by    some   as   an\n\nattack on the centrality of marriage. While there can be no\n\ndoubt   that    in    India,   marriage      is    an    important         social\n\ninstitution, we must also keep our minds open to the fact\n\nthat there are certain individuals or groups who do not\n\nhold the same view. To be sure, there are some indigenous\n\ngroups within our country wherein sexual relations outside\n\nthe marital setting are accepted as a normal occurrence.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                                                                31</span>\n\fEven in the societal mainstream, there are a significant\n\nnumber   of    people        who    see    nothing      wrong     in     engaging       in\n\npremarital sex. Notions of social morality are inherently\n\nsubjective and the criminal law cannot be used as a means\n\nto unduly interfere with the domain of personal autonomy.\n\nMorality      and    Criminality          are     not   co-extensive.             In    the\n\npresent case, the substance of the controversy does not\n\nreally     touch      on     whether           premarital      sex     is        socially\n\nacceptable.      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"341773\" id=\"span_43\">Instead,          the    real    issue     of    concern         is    the\n\ndisproportionate        response          to    the   appellant&#x27;s        remarks.       If\n\nthe complainants vehemently disagreed with the appellant&#x27;s\n\nviews, then they should have contested her views through\n\nthe news media or any other public platform. The law should\n\nnot be used in a manner that has chilling effects on the\n\n`freedom    of      speech    and    expression&#x27;.         It     would      be    apt    to\n\nrefer to the following observations made by this Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/341773/\" id=\"a_76\">S. Rangarajan Vs. P.

The different views are allowed to be\n      expressed by proponents and opponents not because\n      they are correct, or valid but because there is\n      freedom in this country for expressing even\n      differing views on any issue. ... Freedom of\n      expression      which    is     legitimate    and\n      constitutionally protected, cannot be held to\n      ransom by an intolerant group of people.

Thus,   dissemination    of    news    and      views   for   popular\n\nconsumption is permissible under our constitutional scheme.\n\nThe different    views   are   allowed      to   be    expressed    by   the\n\nproponents and opponents.

Before saying omega, it is necessary for us to point\n\nout certain unwarranted developments that have taken place\n\never since the matter was heard till date.                 In fact, during\n\nthe course      of    hearing,    certain    queries      were    put   to   the\n\nlearned counsel appearing for parties so as to clarify the\n\nlegal issue involved in the matter but unfortunately, those\n\nqueries have been highly misunderstood not only by media\n\nbut also by common man.           As a result thereof, we have been\n\nflooded with several letter petitions making a prayer for\n\nreview of the order passed by us.                    It is pertinent to\n\nmention here that no order was passed by us and only during\n\nthe course of hearing, we had either given some instances\n\nor put some questions to the learned counsel which were\n\nanswered by them.         Thus, this hyper active attitude of the\n\ncommon man was, indeed, not called for.                     Some have even\n\ngone to the extent of telling us that we should have known\n\nthe Indian mythology before putting such question. Thus,\n\nwhatever   we    have    said    during    the   course    of     the   hearing\n\nshould be reviewed.             We fail to understand how such an\n\nattitude could be adopted by those learned persons who were\n\ninvolved   in        sending    various     letter     petitions        to   us.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                                                                              34</span>\n\fAdmittedly, all those persons who have sent letters to us\n\nwere    not    present       on    that      particular         date    but   must   have\n\ngathered information from the print and electronic media\n\nwhich evoked their sentiments to such an extent that they\n\nprayed for review.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">32.    It is, therefore, not only desirable but imperative\n\nthat electronic and news media should also play positive\n\nrole in presenting to general public as to what actually\n\ntranspires during the course of the hearing and it should\n\nnot be published in such a manner so as to get unnecessary\n\npublicity       for    its    own       paper      or    news    channel.        Such   a\n\ntendency, which is indeed growing fast, should be stopped.\n\nWe    are     saying    so    as       without      knowing       the    reference      in\n\ncontext of which the questions were put forth by us, were\n\ncompletely ignored and the same were misquoted which raised\n\nunnecessary hue and cry.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">33.
