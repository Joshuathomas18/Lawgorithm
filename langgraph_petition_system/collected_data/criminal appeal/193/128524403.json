The\n\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court, by its common order dated 15 th April 2015\n\npassed in Criminal Appeal No.1969-1970 of 2010, decided all the\n\nAppeals filed by the Appellant and other co-accused raising doubt\n\nabout applicability of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_55\">MCOC Act</a> to these Accused,\n\nexcept Accused No.7-Rakesh Dhawde.

NIA also dropped the charges of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_58\">MCOC Act</a> against all the accused persons, thereby concluding that\n\nno offence under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_59\">MCOC Act</a> is attracted in this case.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_34\">17.

It is submitted by her\n\nthat once it is held by NIA that charges under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_60\">MCOC Act</a> are not\n\nattracted; in other words, those charges are dropped, then the\n\nconfessional statements of Accused Nos.7, 10 and 12 also cannot be\n\nconsidered so as to implicate the Appellant with the alleged offences.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">18.    Further it is submitted that PW-79 and PW-112, on whose\n\nstatements the Appellant was implicated by ATS, have also\n\nretracted their statements made before ATS, in their fresh\n\nstatements recorded by NIA and also recorded under Section 164(5)\n\nof the Code before the Metropolitan Magistrate at Delhi. Next it is\n\nsubmitted that even PW-55, on whose statement Appellant was\n\nimplicated, has also made complaint regarding harassment and\n\ntorture at the hands of ATS to the Human Rights Commission.\n\nSimilarly, PW-22 has also made similar complaint of torture and\n\nharassment by ATS Officers before the Judicial Magistrate, Indore.\n\nIn such circumstances, it is submitted by Appellant that the\n\nstatements of these witnesses, on the basis of which the Appellant\n\nwas implicated by ATS, cannot be relied upon to prove prima facie\n\ncase against her.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_36\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">19.    Lastly, it is submitted by the Appellant that NIA has confirmed\n\n                                12                   APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n that the motor-cycle involved in the bomb-blast was not in her\n\npossession.

On this application of the Appellant seeking fresh bail in view\n\nof the change in circumstance, the learned Special P.P. for NIA has\n\ngiven before the Special Court &#x27;no objection&#x27; for release of the\n\nAppellant on bail, having regard to the report filed by NIA\n\nexonerating her of all the charges.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_39\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">21.     In this Appeal also, the learned ASG Shri. Anil Singh has\n\ncontinued the said stand of NIA by conceding that prosecution has\n\nno objection for release of Appellant on bail. According to learned\n\nASG, NIA has already dropped the charges under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_61\">MCOC Act</a>,\n\nconsidering that there was no sufficient material on record to apply\n\nthose     charges.        It    is   submitted   that,   Accused         No.10-Swami\n\nAmrutanand Devtirth has retracted the confessional statement\n\nmade before the Metropolitan Magistrate, Mumbai, on 25th\n\nNovember 2008.

He has also denied the\n\ncontents of the statement made before the ATS officer relating to\n\nsupply of RDX and bomb for the Malegaon blast. Thus, it is\n\nsubmitted that these confessional statements, which are already\n\nretracted, rules out the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_62\">MCOC Act</a> and, accordingly,\n\nNIA has dropped those charges.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_41\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">22.    It is further submitted by learned ASG that, though it was\n\nrevealed during the course of investigation by NIA also, that &#x27;LML\n\nFreedom Motor-Cycle No.GJ-05-BR-1920&#x27; used in the commission of\n\nthe bomb-blast at Malegaon stands registered in the name of the\n\nAppellant, being purchased by her, the material collected during the\n\ncourse of investigation revealed that the said motor-cycle was in\n\npossession of the absconding accused - Ramji @ Ramchandra\n\nKalsangra and was being used by him well before the blast. Reliance\n\nis placed on the statements of PW-21, PW-23, PW-30 and PW-32, as\n\nrecorded by the ATS officer, to submit that it was absconding\n\naccused - Ramji @ Ramchandra Kalsangra, who was in possession of\n\nthe said motor-cycle.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_43\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_44\">23.    Thus, as per the written submissions filed on behalf of NIA, it is\n\n\n\n                                14                     APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n submitted that not only Accused No.10-Swami Amrutanand\n\nDevtirth has retracted his statement recorded by ATS officer, but\n\neven PW-79, PW-22 and PW-112 have also retracted their\n\nstatements, which were initially made before the ATS officer. Thus,\n\naccording to NIA, there is no incriminating material against the\n\nAppellant and as a result, NIA has given clean-chit to not only the\n\nAppellant but also to some other co-accused, namely, Accused Nos.2,\n\n3, 12, 15 and 16, as no sufficient evidence was found against them.\n\nThus, it is submitted on behalf of NIA by the learned ASG that\n\nprosecution has no objection for granting bail to the Appellant, as\n\nshe is exonerated from all the charges levelled against her.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">24.    The application of the Appellant for bail is, however, strongly\n\nresisted by the Intervenor before the Special Court and this Court\n\nalso. It may be stated that the Intervenor in the case is the father of\n\nthe deceased, who had died in the bomb-blast at Malegaon. The\n\nSpecial Court has, vide its detail order dated 17 th June 2016,\n\nallowed      the      Intervention    Application,   considering           that      as\n\nprosecution is giving its &#x27;no objection&#x27; for release of the Appellant on\n\nbail, practically, there was no one opposing the Bail Application and,\n\nhence, in order to have fair hearing on the point of Bail Application,\n\n\n\n                                 15                       APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n it would be appropriate to give an opportunity of hearing to the\n\nIntervenor, who was the real aggrieved person, as his son has\n\nsuccumbed to death in the bomb-blast. In this Appeal also, on the\n\nsame grounds, we have also allowed the Intervention Application\n\nand heard learned Senior Counsel for the Intervenor Shri. B.A.\n\nDesai, who has strongly resisted the request of the Appellant to be\n\nreleased on bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_46\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_47\">25.    According to learned Senior Counsel for Intervenor, prima\n\nfacie, there is sufficient material on record implicating the Appellant\n\neven at this stage, as the report of the investigation carried out by\n\nATS has to be read conjointly with the Investigation Report\n\nsubmitted by NIA. It is submitted by him that, when earlier Bail\n\nApplication was filed by the Appellant before the Special Court\n\nbearing Exhibit-2400, the Special P.P. on behalf of NIA has strongly\n\nresisted the said Bail Application. Since then, there is no substantial\n\nchange in the circumstances and despite that, this time, NIA has\n\ngiven &#x27;no objection&#x27; for allowing Appellant&#x27;s Bail Application. It is\n\nurged that under the garb of carrying out further investigation, NIA\n\nhas conducted re-investigation and, that too, not of the offence but of\n\nthe investigation made by the ATS. As this re-investigation is made\n\n\n\n                                16                   APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n by NIA without the order of the higher courts, that investigation\n\nitself is illegal. According to learned counsel for the Intervenor, the\n\ninvestigation conducted by NIA is unfair and tainted. NIA has no\n\npower to question the reliability of the investigation conducted by\n\nthe ATS. According to learned counsel for the Intervenor, both, the\n\nTrial Court and this Court, have already held, while deciding\n\nprevious Bail Applications of the Appellant, that, there is sufficient\n\nmaterial on record to show involvement of the Appellant in\n\ncommission of the offences. It is held that, Appellant is the principal\n\nconspirator, as having supplied not only the motor-cycle but also the\n\nmanpower for causing the bomb-blast. Hence, according to learned\n\nSenior Counsel for Intervenor, merely because NIA has dropped the\n\ncharges against Appellant, she cannot be released on bail; especially\n\nhaving regard to the gravity and seriousness of the offence, and the\n\napprehension of Appellant further tampering the prosecution\n\nwitnesses and thereby thwarting the course of justice.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">26.    The Special Court, after hearing at length learned counsel for\n\nthe Appellant, learned counsel for the Intervenor and learned\n\nSpecial P.P., was pleased to reject the application of the Appellant\n\nfor bail by the impugned order holding that the investigation\n\n\n\n                                17                   APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n conducted by ATS, implicating the Appellant, cannot be wiped out\n\ntotally from the record. It was held that the report of the\n\ninvestigation done by NIA is required to be considered conjointly\n\nwith the report of investigation made by ATS and if it is done so,\n\nthen, according to the Special Court, no case was made out for\n\nreleasing the Appellant on bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_49\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_50\">27.    This order of the Special Court is challenged in this Appeal by\n\nlearned counsel for the Appellant; whereas, supported by learned\n\ncounsel for the Intervenor. Their arguments were heard at length by\n\nthis Court. This Court has also perused the written submissions filed\n\non record by them, on the conclusion of oral submissions. Learned\n\nAdditional Solicitor General has, as stated above, conceded in this\n\nCourt also that, in view of the report of the NIA exonerating the\n\nAppellant of all the charges, prosecution has no objection to allow\n\nher application for bail.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_51\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">         Applicability of Section 43-D(5) of the UAP Act\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_53\">28.

It\n\nis submitted that, though the <a href=\"/doc/1389751/\" id=\"a_66\">UAP Act</a> was promulgated on 30 th\n\nDecember 1967 and it was amended on 21 st September 2004, the\n\nstringent provisions pertaining to the bail, namely, sub-section (5)\n\nof <a href=\"/doc/96524627/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 43-D</a> of UAP Act, were introduced only with effect from\n\n31st December 2008 by the Amendment Act No.35 of 2008. It is\n\nurged that, prior to the said amendment, matters relating to arrest,\n\ndetention and bail were governed by the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/445276/\" id=\"a_68\">Code of\n\nCriminal Procedure</a>, 1973, (for short, &quot;the Code&quot;).\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">29.    In this case, it is submitted that the incident took place on 29 th\n\nSeptember 2008 and the Appellant was arrested on 23rd August\n\n2008. The first Bail Application was filed prior to 31 st December\n\n2008. Though the said application came to be rejected by the Trial\n\nCourt, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has permitted her to file fresh\n\napplication.

Perusal of these provisions, thus, makes it clear that, prior to\n\nthe amendment of <a href=\"/doc/165949346/\" id=\"a_94\">Section 43-D(5)</a>, which came into effect from 31 st\n\nDecember 2008, the Bail Applications of the accused persons\n\ncharged for the offences under <a href=\"/doc/1389751/\" id=\"a_95\">UAP Act</a> were required to be\n\nconsidered within the scope of the provisions of the Code; whereas,\n\nnow, after the amendment, such Bail Applications are to be\n\nconsidered as per these provisions of sub-clause (5) of <a href=\"/doc/96524627/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 43-D</a>.\n\nBy way of this Amendment, two additional conditions are laid down,\n\nlike, opportunity of being heard on the application of bail being\n\nextended to the P.P. before passing any order on the Bail Application\n\nof the Accused and second condition to the effect that the accused\n\nshall not be released on bail, if, on perusal of the Case Diary or the\n\nReport made under Section 173 of the Code, the Court is of the\n\nopinion that there are reasonable grounds for believing that the\n\naccusation against such person is prima facie true.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">                                       28                         APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                           ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_91\"> 45.    No doubt, these two conditions are in addition to the conditions\n\nlaid down under the Code on granting of bail; however, these\n\nconditions, in our considered opinion, do not, in any way, affect or\n\nrestrict the right, if any, of the Appellant to be released on bail. Even\n\nwhile deciding the Bail Application of the Accused, as per the\n\nprovisions of the Code, Public Prosecutor is heard and; secondly,\n\nunder the provisions of the Code also, the Court always ensures as to\n\nwhether the accusation against the accused person is prima facie\n\ntrue. If it is so, then his right to get the bail becomes restricted.\n\nTherefore, effectually, there are no such further restrictions laid\n\ndown by the Amendment Act on the Appellant&#x27;s right, if any, of the\n\nbail. Hence, this Amendment cannot be considered as substantively\n\naffecting the right of Appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_92\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_93\">46.    Moreover, in this case, admittedly, the offences alleged against\n\nthe Appellant are non-bailable and punishable with imprisonment\n\nfor life or death, as she is also charged for the offences under Section\n\n302, 120B etc. of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_97\">IPC</a>. Therefore, under the provisions of the Code\n\nalso, it cannot be said that the Appellant has any substantive right\n\nto be released on bail, similar to the right the accused is having in\n\nthe case of bailable offences. Therefore, the Trial Court has rightly\n\n                                29                    APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017               ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n concluded that Appellant cannot claim to have any &quot;vested right&quot; to\n\nbe released on bail under the provisions of the Code.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_94\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1275754\" id=\"span_36\">47.

In the light of our above conclusions on the various\n               submissions, we are convinced that in respect of the\n               appellant in Criminal Appeal No.1971 of 2010,\n               namely, A-7, there is no scope even for the limited\n               purpose of <a href=\"/doc/945595/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 21(4)(b)</a> to hold that application of\n               <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_115\">MCOC Act</a> is doubtful.

There is considerable doubt about their\n               involvement in Parbhani and Jalna and, therefore,\n               they are entitled for their bail applications to be\n               considered on merits.&quot;              [Emphasis Supplied]\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">53.

Hence, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has\n\nnot dropped the charges of MCOC against the Appellant and other\n\nco-accused. However, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has clearly raised a\n\nconsiderable doubt about the applicability of those charges and has\n\n\n\n                                 34                        APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                    ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n directed that so far as the Bail Applications of the present Appellant\n\nand other co-accused, except Accused No.7-Rakesh Dhawde, are\n\nconcerned, they should be decided on their own merit. This\n\nobservation of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court could be further found in\n\nparagraph No.98 of its judgment, wherein the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\n\nset aside the orders of rejection of the bail of the Appellant therein,\n\nnamely, Prasad Purohit, by holding that there is enough scope to\n\ndoubt as to the application of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_119\">MCOC Act</a> under <a href=\"/doc/141161782/\" id=\"a_120\">Section 21(4)(b)</a> for\n\nthe purpose of grant of bail and, accordingly, the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\n\ndirected the Special Judge to consider their application for bail on\n\nmerits, keeping in mind the law <a href=\"/doc/194120/\" id=\"a_121\">laid down in</a> the reported\n\nauthorities, which were referred in paragraph Nos.96 and 97 of the\n\nJudgment, and directed to pass the orders accordingly.

The Appellant herein was, thus,\n\nalso held entitled for the same relief, as was granted to the Appellant\n\ntherein, of consideration of her application for grant of bail. Thus,\n\nthe Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has made the things very clear by directing\n\nthat the Bail Application of the present Appellant is to be decided on\n\nmerits, without considering the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_122\">MCOC Act</a>.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">                                35                   APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_106\"> 55.

In this\n\ncase it was held that,\n\n\n            &quot;Even if the accused persons, at the end of trial, are\n            acquitted for the offences under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_130\">MCOC Act</a>, still the\n            confessional        statements   of   co-accused      can     be\n            considered and relied upon for the purpose of the\n            offences punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_131\">IPC</a>.&quot;</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_110\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_111\">58.

In our considered opinion, at this stage, this point should not\n\ndetain us for long, because the observations of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt in the case of State of Tamil Nadu vs. Nalini (Supra) make it\n\nclear that the question of considering the confessional statements of\n\nco-accused, recorded under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_134\">MCOC Act</a> for the purpose of the offences\n\npunishable under <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_135\">IPC</a>, arises only if the accused persons, at the end\n\nof trial, are acquitted of the charges under <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_136\">MCOC Act</a>. The material\n\nwords are &#x27;at the end of the trial&#x27; .

It clearly shows that, &quot;State Government&quot; is also\n\nauthorized to accord sanction under this provision. It is clear that\n\nfrom 31st December 2008, sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/5268862/\" id=\"a_152\">Section 45</a> of UAP Act\n\nwas inserted, thereby directing both, the Central and State\n\nGovernment, to create one independent Reviewing Authority and\n\ncasting     obligation on       the   Sanctioning   Authority         of Central\n\nGovernment, or, as the case may be, the State Government to\n\nconsider the report of this Authority before according the sanction.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_130\">Thus, it can be seen that both the Central Government as well as the\n\nState Government are empowered to appoint the said Reviewing\n\nAuthority, thereby indicating that both the Central Government and\n\nState Government are competent to accord the sanction.

Therefore, what follows from the discussion of above decisions\n\nis that, it depends upon the nature of objection raised to the\n\nSanctioned Order as to when it can be decided. In this respect, one\n\ncan safely place reliance on the Judgment of our own High Court in\n\nAnil Sadashiv Nanduskar Vs. State of Maharashtra, Laws (Bom) -\n\n2007-11-96, cited by learned counsel for Intervenor. In this case,\n\n\n                                51                    APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017               ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n the &#x27;sanction&#x27; granted under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/38034089/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 21A</a> and <a href=\"/doc/83726174/\" id=\"a_169\">23(2)</a>\n\nof the MCOC Act was challenged on the ground that concerned\n\nauthorities had not applied the mind properly. It was contended that\n\nthe letter of approval did not disclose the material placed before the\n\nSanctioning Authority and the Sanction Order, ex-facie, did not\n\ndisclose that the concerned authority has considered as to whether\n\nthe Appellant was member of the alleged syndicate involved in\n\ncommission of the offence. While dealing with these submissions,\n\nafter taking into consideration the law laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nApex Court in various authorities, the Division Bench of this Court\n\nwas pleased to observe as follows :-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_154\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">            &quot;The settled law by a catena of decisions of Apex Court\n            is to the effect that it is desirable that every order\n            whether the approval or sanction, it should speak for\n            itself, i.e. ex-facie, it should disclose consideration of\n            the materials placed before it and application of mind\n            thereto. However, failure to reproduce or refer those\n            recitals in the resolution or order itself would not\n            render the order of approval or sanction to be invalid\n            unless the prosecution fails to establish by leading\n            evidence that all the materials necessary for the grant\n            of approval or sanction were placed before the\n            concerned authority for due application of mind by\n            such authority before the grant of approval and or\n            sanction.

Undoubtedly, an accused\n            desiring to raise objection regarding the defects in\n            such approval or sanction, or, grant, he can raise such\n            objection; however, for conclusive decision on the said\n            point, the accused has to wait till the trial is complete\n            and on that ground, he cannot insist for discharge\n            unless the objection relates to inherent lack of\n            jurisdiction to the concerned authority to grant\n            sanction or approval and such issue can be decided on\n            undisputed facts. The law being well settled to the\n            effect that the prosecution in a case where sanction or\n            the     approval    order   does   not    ex-facie       show\n            consideration of all the materials and/or application of\n            mind, is entitled to establish the same by leading\n            necessary evidence regarding production of materials\n            before the concerned authority, the question of\n            discharge of accused merely on the basis of such\n            objection being raised cannot arise.

In view of this settled position of law, in our opinion, in the\n\ninstant case also, merely because there is no reference to the report\n\nof the Reviewing Authority in the Sanction Order, at this stage, this\n\nCourt cannot come to the conclusion that the review report was not\n\nconsidered by the Sanctioning Authority and, hence, the &#x27;sanction&#x27; is\n\n                                  53                        APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                     ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n invalid. Whether Sanctioning Authority has considered such report\n\nor not can be decided only after the Sanctioning Authority is given\n\nan opportunity to state so, at the time of trial. Hence, at this stage,\n\nthis contention raised by learned counsel for the Appellant\n\nchallenging the sanction order cannot be accepted.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_158\">         Factual Aspects of this Case qua the Appellant\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_159\">83.    At this stage, it may be stated that this Bail Petition has\n\ncheckered history of litigation. The very first Bail Application\n\npreferred by the Appellant was under Section 167(2) of the Code,\n\nwhich came to be rejected upto Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court. Thereafter,\n\nthe Appellant has preferred two applications for bail on merits; out\n\nof which, one filed at Exhibit-993 came to be rejected on 25 th\n\nSeptember 2012 by the Special Court and Criminal Appeal No.1305\n\nof 2013, preferred against the same, also came to be dismissed on 4 th\n\nApril 2014 by this Court. Her second application for bail filed at\n\nExhibit-2400 also came to be rejected on 21 st September 2015 by\n\nthe Special Court, against which she has not preferred any Appeal to\n\nthis Court. Her application for bail on medical ground is also rejected\n\nby the Special Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_160\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_161\">                                54                   APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n                             Change in Circumstances\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_162\">84.    Now, for maintainability of this fresh application for bail, the\n\nentire reliance of the Appellant, as stated above, is on the &#x27;clean-chit&#x27;\n\ngiven to her by the NIA, which has carried out further investigation,\n\nunder Section 173(8) of the Code. In its investigation, NIA has re-\n\nrecorded the statements of some of the witnesses. Some part of the\n\ninvestigation done by ATS is accepted by NIA; whereas, some part of\n\nthe investigation done by ATS is not relied upon by NIA. NIA has not\n\nonly exonerated the Appellant, but also Accused Nos.2, 3, 12, 15 and\n\n16, from all the charges. NIA has also dropped the MCOCA charge\n\nagainst all the Accused. Thus, it is clear that NIA has found itself to\n\nbe not in agreement on certain points with the investigation done by\n\nATS.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_163\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_164\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1515744\" id=\"span_70\">85.    The question for consideration is whether this report can be\n\nsaid to be change in the circumstances so as to entitle the Appellant\n\nto apply for bail afresh. The Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1515744/\" id=\"a_170\">Babu Singh v. State of UP</a>\n\n[1978 SCC(Cri) 133] held that order refusing application for bail\n\ndoes not necessarily preclude another on later occasion.                   It was\n\nfurther held that if there is more material, further development and\n\ndifferent considerations, the second consideration at later stage is\n\nalways permissible.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_165\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_166\">                                  55                   APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_167\"> 86.    In our considered view, these observations of the Apex Court\n\nare squarely applicable to the facts of the present case. Mr. Gupta,\n\nthe learned Senior Counsel for the Appellant also invited our\n\nattention to the judgment and order dated 9th June 2016 passed in\n\nCriminal Appeal No. 138 of 2016.         This appeal was filed by co-\n\naccused Prasad Purohit. In the said order, this Court observed that\n\ncharge-sheet filed by the NIA is material development and is to be\n\ntermed as material change in circumstances and accordingly\n\ndirected the special Court to deal with the application of accused\n\nPrasad Purohit for bail without being influenced by the observations\n\nmade in its earlier order of rejection of bail application. .\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">87.    In the light of decision of the Apex Court in Babu Sing (supra)\n\nand observations of this Court in Criminal Appeal No. 138 of 2016,\n\nwe find ourselves unable to agree with the submission of Mr. Desai,\n\nthe learned Senior Counsel for the Intervenor that there is no\n\nchange in the the circumstances and we hold that the present\n\napplication of the Appellant is maintainable in view of the change in\n\nthe circumstances, namely, filing of report by NIA under section\n\n173(8) of the Code, under which Appellant is exonerated.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_169\">                                56                     APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n   Re-investigation / Further Investigation Carried Out by NIA\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_170\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"84627277\" id=\"span_73\">88.    Mr. Desai, the learned Senior Counsel for the intervenor in\n\nthis regard vehemently argued that fresh / re-investigation can be\n\nundertaken at the instance of the higher Courts only. He submitted\n\nthat whatever investigation is carried out by the NIA is without\n\nauthority from higher Courts and therefore it is illegal.               He heavily\n\nrelied upon the decision of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/84627277/\" id=\"a_171\">Vinjay Tyagi v. Irshad\n\nAli @ Deepak</a> [(2013) 5 SCC 762]. In this case one of the question\n\nwhich fell for consideration before the Apex Court was, &#x27;whether CBI\n\nis empowered to conduct fresh investigation / re-investigation when\n\ncognizance has already been taken by the Court of competent\n\njurisdiction on the basis of a police report under section 173 of the\n\nCode?&#x27; The Apex Court thus observed in paragraph 45 :</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">         &quot;45. The power to order/direct &quot;reinvestigation&quot; or &quot;de\n               novo&quot; investigation falls in the domain of higher\n               courts, that too in exceptional cases. If one examines\n               the provisions of the Code, there is no specific\n               provision for cancellation of the reports, except that\n               the investigating agency can file a closure report\n               (where according to the investigating agency, no\n               offence is made out). Even such a report is subject to\n               acceptance by the learned Magistrate, who, in his\n               wisdom, may or may not accept such a report. For\n               valid reasons, the Court may, by declining to accept\n\n                                57                        APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n                such a report, direct &quot;further investigation&quot;, or even\n               on the basis of the record of the case and the\n               documents        annexed   thereto,     summon           the\n               accused.&quot;[Emphasis Supplied]\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_171\">89.    Reading of above observations make it clear that power of\n\nordering fresh or de novo investigation needs to be exercised by the\n\nhigher judiciary sparingly and in the rarest of rare cases. There is\n\nno dispute that NIA in the present case has not undertaken such\n\nfurther investigation on the basis of any order passed by the higher\n\njudiciary but the Central Government in exercise of powers under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/51260634/\" id=\"a_172\">section 6(5)</a> of the NIA Act, by the order dated 1st April 2011\n\ntransferred the investigation of the subject crime to the NIA and\n\naccordingly NIA re-registered the offence and started further\n\ninvestigation. The order of the Central Government transferring the\n\ninvestigation of the subject crime to the NIA was challenged by the\n\npresent Appellant by filing Criminal Writ Petition No.4049 of 2012\n\nwhich was decided by this Court by its order dated 11 th October\n\n2013. In the said writ petition the Appellant herein challenged the\n\nhanding over of the investigation to the NIA and sought a writ\n\nrestraining NIA from exercising any power in pursuance of the <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_173\">NIA\n\nAct</a> for doing fresh or further investigation of the subject crime.\n\nHowever, after hearing the parties and analysing the provisions of\n\n                                  58                      APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                   ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n <a href=\"/doc/51730711/\" id=\"a_174\">NIA Act</a>, this Court concluded that the power of NIA to investigate is\n\nabsolute and it is a matter of procedure, then there is no vested right\n\ncreated in the accused to object to the course permitted by the\n\nstatute and there is no need to read down <a href=\"/doc/128858156/\" id=\"a_175\">section 6</a> of the NIA Act.\n\nIt was further held by this Court that when the NIA comes into\n\npicture for the purpose of investigation and prosecution of the\n\nscheduled offence, then, that very object and purpose will be\n\ndefeated if the investigating agency is prevented from investigating\n\nthe crime.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_172\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_173\">90.

As regards the Appellant, as stated above, NIA is not in\n\nagreement with the conclusion drawn by ATS and it has completely\n\nexonerated the Appellant from all the charges. Hence, the necessary\n\nquestion arising for consideration is, &#x27;as to the investigation of\n\nwhich Investigating Agency is to be accepted or relied upon for\n\ndeciding the present Bail Application of the Appellant?&#x27; The answer\n\nto this question need not detain us any more, as it is clearly found in\n\nthe above-said landmark decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the\n\n\n\n                                59                    <a href=\"/doc/177864648/\" id=\"a_176\">APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc</a>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017               ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:10 :::</span>\n case of <a href=\"/doc/84627277/\" id=\"a_177\">Vinay Tyagi Vs.

It is alleged by ATS that, &#x27;LML Freedom Motor-Cycle&#x27;, bearing\n\nRegistration No.MH-15-P-4572, was found at the spot of the incident\n\nin a severely damaged condition. According to prosecution, number\n\n&quot;MH-15-P-4572&quot; was a fake number. The engine number as also the\n\nchassis number was also not visible. Hence, the motorcycle was\n\nreferred to the FSL Nasik for determining its engine and chassis\n\nnumbers. As per the report of FSL Nasik dated 7 th October 2008, it\n\nwas not possible to find out the chassis number and even the engine\n\nnumber could not be determined with certainty.                    The report\n\nsuggested that engine number of the said vehicle could be any of the\n\nfollowing three numbers :\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_5\">                        i]      50K261886\n                        ii]     50K267686\n                        iii]    50K261686\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_204\">101.

The manufacturer stated\n\nthat the above said three numbers did not correspond to any vehicle\n\nmanufactured by them. Further LML stated that engine numbers\n\nthat closely resemble actual vehicles manufactured by them were :\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_6\">                                I]    E55OK261886\n                                II]   E55OK261686\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_205\">102. They further informed that these vehicles were sold to the\n\ndealers at Surat and Badayu respectively. On 10 th November 2008\n\non the basis of statement of PW-45 the financer, the prosecution for\n\nthe first time came to know that vehicle bearing Engine\n\nNo.E55OK261886 was registered in the name of Appellant and its\n\nnumber was &quot;GJ-05 BR-1920&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_206\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_207\">103. Thus, there is enough doubt about motorcycle of which the\n\nAppellant is the registered owner, was found at the spot of incident.\n\nEven assuming the said motorcycle was found at the place of the\n\nincident, the fact that Appellant is the registered owner of it by itself\n\ncannot be sufficient in the light of material on record brought by the\n\nprosecution itself. In this regard, reference must be made to the\n\nstatements of PW-21, PW-23 and PW-46. Statement of PW-21 was\n\n\n                                      69                 APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017                  ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:11 :::</span>\n recorded by the ATS on 20th October 2008. PW-21 is ITI electrical\n\ndiploma holder and has a motorcycle garage at Indore, wherein he\n\ncarries on his business of repair of motorcycle and scooter. He has\n\nstated that absconding accused Ramji since 2 years used to bring\n\nmotorcycle No. GJ-05 BR-1920 to his garage for servicing. He has\n\nfurther stated that in July 2008 also Ramji had brought the said\n\nmotorcycle.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_208\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_209\">104. The statement of PW-21 is supported by contemporaneous\n\nrecord maintained by him and seized by ATS. PW-23 is the cousin of\n\nabsconding accused Ramji and his statement is recorded by ATS on\n\n20th October 2008. PW-23 has also stated that he has seen Ramji\n\nusing the said motorcycle in question for the period of one year prior\n\nto the date of recording of his statement. Statement of PW-23 is also\n\nrecorded under section 164 of the CR.P.C.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_210\">105. Further, there is statement of PW-46, which was recorded by\n\nATS on 12th November 2008. He has stated that absconding accused\n\nRamji initially was using black colour motorcycle of SS Honda\n\ncompany. In the year 2004, he sold this motorcycle and purchased\n\ngray colour Maruti van. Ramji used Maruti van for the period of 1\n\nand 1/2 years and thereafter he sold it and bought one second hand\n\n                                70                    APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017               ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:11 :::</span>\n LLM 4 stroke golden colour scooter.     He has also stated that in\n\nDiwali of 2007 he saw golden LLM freedom scooter No. GJ-05 BR-\n\n1920 at the house of Ramji.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_211\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_212\">106. PW-45 is a financer, through whom the said motorcycle was\n\ngot financed. His statement shows that on 4-9-2004 repayments\n\nwere made of the outstanding amount and original papers were\n\ntaken back by the Appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_213\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_214\">107. Statements of PW-21, PW-23, PW-46 and PW-45, thus, do show\n\nthat the Appellant was not in possession of the said motorcycle since\n\nmuch prior to the incident. The trial Court in this regard observed\n\nthat the motorcycle was being used by accused Ramji much prior to\n\nthe date of incident is the defence of the Appellant which can be\n\nproved during trial. However, we find that this is not the defence of\n\nthe Appellant but these facts are borne out from the material\n\ncollected by the ATS itself.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_215\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_216\">108. This takes us to consider the second allegation against\n\nAppellant of her participation in Bhopal meeting in which alleged\n\nconspiracy to strike terror at Malegaon was hatched. In this regard,\n\nATS has relied upon statements of PW-55, PW-79 and PW-112.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_217\">                                71                  APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017             ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:11 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_218\"> 109. PW-55 in his statement under section 161 and 164(5) of the\n\nCode recorded by ATS has stated that Accused No.9-Prasad Purohit\n\nonce told him that he himself, absconding accused Ramji and\n\nSudhakar Chaturvedi fitted bomb in the motorcycle provided by\n\npresent Appellant. In his further examination by NIA, however, this\n\nwitness has retracted from his earlier statement recorded by the\n\nATS.      This witness has also lodged complaint against ATS in\n\nMaharashtra Human Right Commission that his statement under\n\nSection 164(5) of the Code was got recorded forcibly by ATS.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_219\">110. PW-79 in his statement, recorded under Sections 161 and\n\n164(5) of the Code by ATS, has stated that in Bhopal meeting\n\nAccused No.9-Prasad Purohit discussed taking revenge by carrying\n\nout bomb blasts especially in muslim populated area. He has also\n\nstated that thereupon Appellant assured to provide men for this\n\npurpose. NIA rexamined this witness as witness No. 182. During\n\nhis examination he stated that he did not attend any meeting of\n\nAbhinav Bharat. He also stated that he had not visited Bhopal until\n\nATS took him to a Ram Mandir at Bhopal in the month of May 2009.\n\nAs such statement of this witness was also recorded under section\n\n\n\n                                72                 APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017            ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:11 :::</span>\n 164(5) of the Code at Delhi before learned Metropolitan Magistrate\n\nby NIA. In this statement before learned Metropolitan Magistrate,\n\nDelhi, PW-79 (new PW-182) confirmed that he did not attend the\n\nBhopal meeting. This witness has also alleged torture by ATS.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_220\">111. Statement of PW-112 was recorded by ATS under section 161\n\nas well as under section 164(5) of the Code. He has stated that he\n\nattended Abhinav Bharat meeting at Bhopal held in the month of\n\nApril 2008. In the said meeting, Accused No.9-Prasad Purohit told\n\nabout Jihadi activities against which they have to do something and\n\nurged to do something and told that preparation for guerrilla war is\n\non. At this time, the Appellant said that some people are ready for\n\nthis task.      This witness also stated that PW79 was looking after\n\nrefreshment or catering arrangement in the said building. PW-112\n\nwas re-examined by NIA as Witness No.184. In this re-examination\n\nthis witness did not support his earlier statement to ATS which was\n\nsubsequently recorded under section 164(5) of the Code. He stated\n\nthat he was forced to make statement and expressed his willingness\n\nto depose before the Magistrate. As such, his statement was\n\nrecorded by NIA under section 164(5) of the Code before learned\n\nMetropolitan Magistrate, Patiala House, New Delhi.

At this stage, reference deserves to be made to the statement\n\nof PW-121 and PW-150 recorded by ATS on 27.12.2008 and\n\n17.3.2009 respectively. Theses witnesses are alleged to be present\n\nat Bhopal meeting. Statements of these witnesses recorded by ATS\n\ndo not disclose any objectionable and incriminating material against\n\nthe Appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_223\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_224\">113. Reference also deserves to be made to the statement of PW-22\n\nrecorded by ATS on 20.10.2008 under Sections 161 and 164 of the\n\nCode. In these statements, this witness has stated about the meeting\n\nbetween the Appellant and absconding accused Ramji at Ujjain on\n\n8.10.2008 after the incident in question.         In the said meeting\n\nabsconding accused Ramji is alleged to have confessed that he\n\ncommitted blast at Malegaon by using the motorcycle of Appellant\n\nand also told her to inform the police. It is however pertinent to note\n\nthat this witness (PW-22) had lodged complaint before JMFC,\n\nIndore, on 26.11.2011 stating that he was illegally detained and\n\ntortured by ATS to give statements. PW-22 has given statement on\n\n\n\n                                74                   APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017              ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:11 :::</span>\n oath before the JMFC, Indore, in support of complaint filed by him\n\ncharging ATS officials with various offences.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_225\">114. Thus, in respect of above witnesses, apart from retraction and\n\nallegation of torture, their statements give two contradictory\n\nversions. Though there is some material on record that Appellant\n\nwas present at the Bhopal meeting, this material, however, shows\n\nthat apart from the Appellant several other persons were also\n\npresent at the said meeting.         In our view, the same cannot be\n\nconsidered as circumstance against the Appellant alone, excluding\n\nthe other participants, especially, now in the absence of any\n\nobjectionable and incriminating material attributed to her.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_226\">115. In above facts and circumstances, in our considered opinion, if\n\nboth the Reports of ATS and NIA are considered conjointly, so far as\n\nthe Appellant is concerned, it cannot be said that there are\n\nreasonable grounds for believing that accusation made against her\n\nare prima facie true. Once it is held so, then the benefit of bail cannot\n\nbe withheld to the Appellant, even if the offences alleged against her\n\nby ATS are grave and serious one.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_227\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_228\">                                75                    APEAL-545-16-Pragya Singh.doc\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\"> ::: Uploaded on - 25/04/2017               ::: Downloaded on - 26/04/2017 00:49:11 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_229\"> 116.

The medical\n\ncertificate further shows that Appellant is being given treatment in\n\nAyurvedic hospital.
