In the application, it is mentioned that on 10/3/2022 the counsel\nfor the appellant no.1 withdrew the application and second application\nwas withdrawn on 8/4/2022. It is mentioned in the application that the\napplications were withdrawn with an oblique motive not to grant\nbail to appellant no.1, whereas bail is the constitutional right of an\naccused. It is further mentioned in the application that the allegations\nmade against the appellant no.1 would make out an offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 323</a> of IPC only.

Furthermore, there is nothing on record to show\nthat the injuries sustained by the victim were dangerous to life. No\nfracture of skull bone was found. Unless and until the skull bone suffers\nfracture, no offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 307</a> of IPC would be made out.\nFurthermore, the police had referred the injured for MLC to the\nGovernment Hospital, but the complainant with an intention to\nmanipulate the things, went to the private hospital, namely, Sahara\nHospital and got himself admitted. The private hospital is not entitled to\nissue any MLC. The weapon of offence was not produced. If a boy aged\nabout 37 years gives repeated blow on the head of the injured, then his\nhead would not have remained intact. It is submitted that in fact at first\nFSL report was not received and only after the orders of the Trial Judge,\nspecifically at the instance of the Trial Judge, the FSL report was\nsent projecting that the blood was found on the weapon seized from\nthe possession of the appellant no.1. Even otherwise, there is no blood\ngroup to show that the blood found on the weapon seized from the\npossession of the appellant no.1 belongs to the complainant.\nFurthermore, in the seizure memo, Ex.P/2 the place of seizure of weapon\nis not mentioned. The Remand Magistrate had also scolded the police for\nnot filing the medical documents. Thus, it is clear that they have filed the\nfabricated and forged medical documents.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"59692269\" id=\"span_2\">The appellant no.1 had prayed\nfor examination of CMHO as well as CSP to prove that the private\nhospitals are not competent to issue MLC, but the Trial Court by order\n          3  THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                      AT GWALIOR\n              CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.522 OF 2022\n     (<a href=\"/doc/59692269/\" id=\"a_7\">MRINAL SHARMA AND ANOTHER VS.

Per contra, the application is vehemently opposed by the counsel\nfor the State. It is submitted that on earlier occasions, the bail\napplications were withdrawn after arguing the matter at length. It is\nfurther submitted that for making out an offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 307</a> of\nIPC, it is not necessary that the victim must suffer a fracture of skull /\nparietal bone. The knowledge or intention on the part of the accused is\nsufficient to make out an offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 307</a> of IPC. It is further\nsubmitted that it is incorrect to show that a private hospital is not entitled\nto treat the injured. The information given by the CMHO by his letter\ndated 5/12/2013 merely mentions that the hospitals which have been\nregistered under Madhya Pradesh Upcharya Grih Tatha Rujopchar\nSambandhi Sthapna Me Reistrikaran Tatha Anugyapan Niyam, 1997 have\nnot been authorized to issue any MLC.

It is further submitted that in fact it appears that the\nPairokar of appellant no.1 is in the habit of making allegations\nagainst the Judges. It is really unfortunate that the Pairokar of\nappellant no.1 has alleged that the FSL report has been received only\nat the instance of the Trial Judge.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">7.

It is further submitted that the\nPairokar of appellant no.1 is himself conceding that the allegations of\nassault on the head of the injured may amount to an offence under\n<a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 323</a> of IPC. Even in the bail application, it is mentioned that at\nthe most the offence can be under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 323</a> of IPC. It is further\nsubmitted that for making out an offence under <a href=\"/doc/455468/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 307</a> of IPC, the\nnature of injury is not material. The intention and knowledge that it may\ncause death of the injured is material, which can be inferred from the\nweapon used as well as the part of the body which was chosen for\ncausing injury.

State of Punjab</a>, has analysed\n  the precedents of this Court and held that examination\n  of a ballistic expert is not an inflexible rule in every\n  case involving use of a lethal weapon.

It has, however, been argued that in every\n         case where an accused person is charged with\n         having committed the offence of murder by a\n         lethal weapon, it is the duty of the prosecution\n         to prove by expert evidence that it was likely\n         or at least possible for the injuries to have been\n         caused with the weapon with which, and in the\n         manner in which, they have been alleged to\n         have been caused; and in support of this\n         proposition, reliance has been placed on the\n         decision of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/31143592/\" id=\"a_45\">Mohinder Singh v.\n         State</a> [(1950) SCR 821] .</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"59692269\" id=\"span_24\">In that case, this\n         Court has held that where the prosecution case\n         was that the accused shot the deceased with a\n         gun, but it appeared likely that the injuries on\n         the deceased were inflicted by a rifle and there\n         was no evidence of a duly qualified expert to\n         prove that the injuries were caused by a gun,\n         and the nature of the injuries was also such\n         that the shots must have been fired by more\n         than one person and not by one person only,\n         and there was no evidence to show that\n    13   THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                  AT GWALIOR\n         CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.522 OF 2022\n(<a href=\"/doc/59692269/\" id=\"a_46\">MRINAL SHARMA AND ANOTHER VS.

It\n        would be noticed that these observations were\n        made in a case where the prosecution evidence\n        suffered from serious infirmities and in\n        determining the effect of these observations, it\n        would not be fair or reasonable to forget the\n        facts in respect of which they came to be\n        made. These observations do not purport to lay\n        down an inflexible Rule that in every case\n        where an accused person is charged with\n        murder caused by a lethal weapon, the\n        prosecution case can succeed in proving the\n        charge only if an expert is examined. It is\n        possible to imagine cases where the direct\n        evidence is of such an unimpeachable\n        character and the nature of the injuries\n        disclosed by post-mortem notes is so clearly\n        consistent with the direct evidence that the\n        examination of a ballistic expert may not be\n        regarded as essential. Where the direct\n        evidence is not satisfactory or disinterested or\n        where the injuries are alleged to have been\n        caused with a gun and they prima facie appear\n        to have been inflicted by a rifle, undoubtedly\n        the apparent inconsistency can be cured or the\n        oral evidence can be corroborated by leading\n        the evidence of a ballistic expert. In what cases\n        the examination of a ballistic expert is\n        essential for the proof of the prosecution case,\n        must naturally depend upon the circumstances\n        of each case.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"59692269\" id=\"span_25\">Therefore, we do not think that\n        Mr Purushottam is right in contending as a\n         14 THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                     AT GWALIOR\n            CRIMINAL APPEAL NO.522 OF 2022\n   (<a href=\"/doc/59692269/\" id=\"a_47\">MRINAL SHARMA AND ANOTHER VS.
