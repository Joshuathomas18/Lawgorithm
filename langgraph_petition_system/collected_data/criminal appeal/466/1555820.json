The prosecution case in brief as emerging from the recitals contained in the\nevidence of the two eye-witnesses, Mahadev Dithe, P.W. 2 and Vithal Gaikwad, P.W.\n3, is as under :---\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">In the month of February, 1992, elections for Zilla Parishad, Solapur, were held, from village Tungat two persons, Dinkar Patil and Prakash Patil were in the fray. While Mahadev Dithe, Vithal Gaikwad and Satish Savase had canvassed for Dinkar Patil, the appellants had supported Prakash Patil. The result of the elections was declared on 26-2-1992 and Prakash Patil was declared to be elected. The appellants took out the symbolic victory procession from State Transport stand (S.T. stand) at Tungat. When the procession reached the house of Dr. Savase, brother of the deceased Satish Savase, the appellants started hurling abuses and throwing stones at the house of Dr. Savase.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">On 12-4-1992, at about 9/9.15 p.m. while Mahadev Dithe was in the village, one Ditip Gaikwad came and informed him that a fight was going on between Kumar Randive and appellant Audumbar Randive at the S.T. Stand in Tungat. Mahadev Dithe whose house was adjacent to that o! Satish Savase, informed the latter and immediately, thereafter, Mahadev Dithe, and Satish Savase, proceeded for the S.T. stand in a car. They found Kumar Randive and Vithai Gaikwad were present there. Kumar Randive informed Satish Savase that Audumbar had called him and had offered him a paan and had asked him to smoke and when he refused to smoke, he asked him the reasons for the refusal. At that time, appellant Shivaji had come there with a bottle of liquor and had asked him to consume the liquor, which he declined, resulting in exchange of abuses and a fight between him and Audumbar.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">Mahadev Dithe along with Vithal Gaikwad, Satish Savase, and Kumar Randive, started on a car for Pandharpur police station for lodging an FIR in respect of the assault on Kumar Randive. After sometime, they reached village Chincholi, where they found that Audumbar was standing by the side of the road along with his relations. They stopped the car. Satish Savase asked Audumbar why he had hurled stones at his house and beaten Kumar Randive. He told him that he was going to lodge an F.I.R. and made Audumbar sit in the car. At that time, Audumbar was having an injury over his head. Audumbar asked Satish not to take him to police station and promised that he would apologies in the presence of the villagers. Consequently, Satish Savase and others turned the car towards village Tungat. At about 11/11.15 p.m. they reached the S.T. stop in Tungat. Audumbar wanted to urinate and hence, the car was stopped at the S.T. stand. After urinating, Audumbar did not sit in the car. Satish Savase and others asked him to proceed to the village on foot. Mahadev Dithe and Satish Savase, caught hold of Audumbar and forcibly started taking him towards the village. Vithal Gaikwad and Kumar Randive also accompanied them. When they reached in front of the house of Suresh Saudagar whose house adjoins that of Shahji Saudagar Audambar started abusing loudly. At that time, appellant-Shivaji along with his son, appellant Kisan, came on a motor-cycle and appellants Dilip and Dhanaji also came there. Shivaji dashed his motor-cycle on the legs of Satish Savase who fell down as a result thereof. Thereafter, all five of them namely Dilip, Dhanaji, Shivaji, Kisan and Audumbar started giving kick and fist blows to Satish. Shivaji Randive took out a sword-stick from his waist and inflicted a blow with it, on the back of Satish. When Mahadev Dithe, went forward to rescue Satish Savase, Dhanaji punched him and Dilip pointed out a sword towards him and threatened that in case he came near, he would kill him. Apart from Dithe and Vithal Gaikwad, this incident was seen by Maruti Randive and Kuber Dithe. After assaulting Satish, the appellants ran away.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_11\">Satish Savase was assaulted in front of the house of Shahaji Saudagar.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">This incident is alleged to have been seen in electric light. Satish Savase who was in a precariously injured condition became unconscious. Consequently, Mahadev Dithe and others arranged a jeep and on the same, took Satish Savase to Cottage Hospital, Pandharpur.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">5. At the Cottage Hospital, Pandharpur, Dr. Rajshekar Chalak P.W. 4 medically\nexamined Satish Savase at 2.30 a.m. on 13-4-1992 and found him to be dead.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_14\">6. The informant Dithe after learning from Dr. Chalak that Satish Savase was\ndead proceeded to police station, Pandharpur, where he lodged his F.I.R. P.S.I. Sunil Shivarkar, P.W. 6 was present at the police station. He recorded the F.I.R. lodged by Dithe. On the basis of the F.I.R., at 2.30 a.m. on 13-4-1992, he registered a case under section 302 I.PC. etc. against the appellants.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">7. After registering the F.I.R., P.S.I. Shivarkar, P.W. 6, proceeded for the Cottage Hospital, Pandharpur, along with some police personnel. He found the dead\nbody in Room No. 4 of the Hospital and deputed a constable in the Hospital and\nhimself proceeded to village Tungat. He searched for the accused persons in the\nvillage but, they could not be found nor could the motor-cycle used in the offence be\nfound. P.S.I. Shivarkar, returned to the Cottage Hospital, Pandharpur at 6.15 a.m.\nand drew the inquest panchanama of the corpse and handed over the same to constable Salunkhe, for autopsy. He recorded the supplementary statement of Dithe;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_16\">Thereafter, P.S.I. Shivarkar proceeded to village Tungat, where between 9 a.m. to 10 a.m. he prepared the panchanama of the scene of the offence. He attached the blood-stained earth, plain earth, a white cap said to be belonging to appellant Shivaji and a leather sandle belonging to appellant-Audumbar, from the place of the incident. The site plan prepared by him shows thai the incident took place in front of the house of Shahaji Saudagar.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_17\">Thereafter, P.S.I. Shivarkar recorded\n \n\nAt 4 p.m. the same day, the appellants Sharad @ Kisan and Dhanaji came to the police station, where they were arrested. Kisan produced a Rajdoot Motor-cycle bearing No. M.F.J. 3434 which was seized under a panchanama Exhibit 24. On 13-4-1992, he recorded the statement of Kuber Randive.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">8. On 15-4-1992, the investigation was handed over by P.S.I. Shivarkar to P.S.I. Anil Patil P.W. 7. The evidence of P.S.I. Patil is that on 15-4-1992, during interrogation, Shivaji-appellant, made a statement in the presence of panchas that he had concealed one sword-stick, his shirt and dhoti and he would produce the same. The memorandum panchanama Exhibit 39 was made.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">Thereafter, along with public panchas, police personnel and the appellant-Shivaji P.S.I. Anil Patil, proceeded in a jeep, towards village Tungat. The appellant asked the jeep to be stopped, near his house. He entered his house and from a window in the room, which was situated towards the eastern side, took out a sword-stick which was covered with a plastic cover and had blood stains. He also produced a dhoti and a shirt which were kept below a photograph. They were also stained with blood. The sword stick, dhoti and shirt were seized under a panchanama Exhibit 40.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_20\">On 25-4-1992, the appellant-Dilip was arrested. On 28-4-1992, he confessed before the panchas that he could get the sword recovered. Consequently, a memorandum panchanama Exhibit 41 was prepared. Thereafter, along with Dilip, public panchas and police personnel, P.S.I. Patil proceeded in a jeep to village Tungat. The appellant asked the jeep to be stopped in front of the dispensary of Dr. More. The appellant showed them a house which he said belonged to him. It had a thatched roof and he produced a sword, concealed near the wall in the leaves of sugarcane. The recovery was made under a panchanama Exhibit 42.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_21\">On 10-5-1992, P.S.I. Patil sent the weapons recovered, on the pointing out of appellants Dilip and Shivaji, the blood-stained earth, recovered from the place of the incident, and some other articles to the Chemical Analyst. After receiving the report of the Chemical Analyst, on 8-7-1992, he submitted the charge sheet.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">9. Going backwards, the autopsy on the corpse of Satish Savase was conducted\non 13-4-1992, by Dr. Chalak, P.W. 4. Dr. Chalak found that in all, Satish Savase had\nsuffered nine ante-mortem injuries, their break-up being thus :---\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_23\">One stab injury, seven abrasions, and one contusion.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">The stab injury was on the back of the renal area on the left side, 3 cm. lateral midline x 16cm. above left iliac region of the size of 1 x 1/2 x 6 cm. elliptical in shape, tapering on both the ends, bleeding present, edges clean cut. Contusion was situated on the right side scrotum bearing dimension of 6 cm. x 3 cm. reddish in colour. All the seven abrasions were distributed between the hands and legs.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">On internal examination, Dr. Chalak found diaphragm on the left side, and peritoneum perforated. He also found a perforated wound on the left lung and an incised wound on the outer border of the left kidney.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">In the opinion of Dr. Chalak, the deceased died on account of the injuries to vital organs like diaphragm, left kidney, left lung and left part of liver. Dr. Chalak stated in the Court, that vital organs were damaged due to injury No. 1 i.e. stab wound, suffered by the deceased. He further stated that stab injury could be caused by Article No. 12 (sword-stick) shown to him and was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature, to cause death of the deceased. He stated that injury No. 9 which was a contusion suffered by the deceased on the scrotum, could be caused if a motor-cycle dashed against a person.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">10. Once again, going backwards, an F.I.R. with respect to the same incident was lodged by appellant-Audumbar at Pandharpur Police Station on 13-4-1992 at1.45 p.m. against the informant Mahadev Dithe P.W. 2, Vithal Gaikwad P.W. 3, Satyavan Savase (deceased) and Kumar Randive. On its basis, a case under section 323 r/w 34 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_10\">I.P.C</a>. was registered.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">Same day at 6.30 p.m. Audumbar was medically examined by Dr. Chalak, who found on his person, one contused lacerated wound, two contusions and one abrasion. The said injuries in his opinion, were attributable to a hard and blunt object.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">In the injury report, Dr. Chalak mentioned in the column of &#x27;history of assault&#x27; alleged assault on 12-4-1992 at 9.30 p.m.\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_30\">11. The case was committed to the Court of Sessions in the usual manner. In the trial Court, the appellants were charged on the counts mentioned in para 2. They pleaded not guilty to the said charges and claimed to be tried.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_31\">During the trial, in all the prosecution examined eight witnesses. Two of them namely Mahadev Dithe, P.W. 2 and Vithal Gaikwad, PW. 3, were examined as eyewitnesses.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">In defence, no witness was examined.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">After recording the evidence adduced by the prosecution; perusing the Exhibits proved by the prosecution and the defence; and hearing the learned Counsel for the parties, the trial Judge convicted and sentenced the five appellants; four of whom have preferred Criminal Appeal No. 176 of 1994, and one Criminal Appeal No. 246 of 1994, in the manner stated in para 2. As mentioned in para 3, through these four connected matters, the said judgment of the trial Court has been impugned.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_34\">12. We have heard Ms. Revati Mohite-Dere for the appellants and Ms. J.S. Pawar, Additional Public Prosecutor for the respondent in Criminal Appeal No. 176 of 1994; Mr. Adhik Shirodkar with Mr. Rajendra Shirodkar and Ms B.L. Mahant for the appellant, Ms. J.S. Pawar for respondent in Criminal Appeal No. 246 of 1994; Ms. J.S. Pawar, Additional Public Prosecutor for the appellants and Ms. Revati Mohite-Dere for the respondents, in Criminal Appeal No. 282 of 1994, and Mr. P.N. Patil, for the petitioner (original complainant), Ms Revati Mohite Dere for the respondent Nos. 1 to 4 and Ms. J.S. Pawar, Additional Public Prosecutor for the respondent No. 5 in Criminal Revision Applicaiton No. 91 of 1994.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">We have also perused the evidence on record; the material Exhibits tendered and proved by the prosecution; and the impugned judgment. After thoughtfully reflecting over the matter, we are of the view that Criminal Appeal No. 246 of 1994 deserves to be dismissed. Criminal Appeal Nos. 176 of 1994 and 282 of 1994, deserve to be partly allowed and Criminal Revision Application No. 91 of 1994 would stand disposed off in terms of our judgment in Criminal Appeal No. 282 of 1994.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">13. The evidence adduced by the prosecution can be categorised under two heads:\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(a) ocular evidence in the form of P.W. 2 Mahadeo Dithe and P.W. 3 Vithal Gaikwad; and \n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(b) recovery of blood-stained sword-stick at the pointing out of appellant-Shivaji and a sword on that of appellant Dilip.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">We may straight away mention that we are not inclined to accept the evidence of recovery of weapons, on the pointing out of appellants Dilip and Shivaji. Apart from the fact that although, there is a time gap of 13 days, between the recovery of the sword-stick and sword, and yet the unhappy coincidence is that the public panchas are common, there is evidence to show that subsequent to the recovery, the said weapons were not sealed. In this connection, it would be pertinent to point cut that there is no mention either in the recovery panchanama of the sword-stick or in that of sword about sealing.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1859148\" id=\"span_1\">A Division Bench of this Court of which one of us (Sahai, J.) was a member, in the case  <a href=\"/doc/1859148/\" id=\"a_11\">State of Maharashtra v. Prabhu Gade</a>, in para 12, after relying upon the decisions reported in T.T. Board v. Moothathi, 1955 Cr.L.J. page 835, D.D. Suvarna v. State of Maharashtra, 1994 Cr.L.J. 3602 observed that it is obligatory for the prosecution to show that right from lime, the weapons were recovered and till they were sent to the Chemical Analyst, they were kept in a sealed condition.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">Not only is there no mention about sealing of weapons, in both the recovery panchanamas, but neither Abhimanyu Lokhande, P.W. 5 Muddemal Clerk of Pandharpur Police Station, who had received the said weapons nor Haridas Kalunkhe, P.W. 8, who carried the recovered weapons to the Chemical Analyst, stated that they were in a sealed condition. The Investigating Officer P.S.I. Shivarkar P.W. 6, who was cross-examined, admitted that sometimes in recovery memos, he mentions about sealing. His evidence, shows that he was alive to the importance of seating. The defence suggestion, though denied by him is that the weapons were tampered with after recovery. In such a situation, we ignore the said evidence. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_40\">14. We now, come to the ocular account rendered by Mahadeo Dithe P.W. 2 and Vithal Gaikwad, P.W. 3. We may mention that it is on the basis of the averments contained in their examination-in-chief that we have set out the prosecution story in para 4 of our judgment. Hence, we are not extensively setting it out. In short, it is that about two months prior to the incident, there were elections to Zilla Parishad and in which, two persons namely Dinkar Patil and Prakash Patil were in the fray from Block Tungat. While Mahadeo Dithe, Vithal Gaikwad and Satish Savase (deceased) supported Dinkar Patil, the appellants had supported Prakash Patil. In the said elections, Prakash Patil emerged victorious. On 12-4-1992, at about 9/9.15 p.m. these witnesses learnt that a scuffle was going on between Kumar Randive and appellant-Audumbar at Tungat S.T. stand. On the said information, these witnesses along with the deceased Satish Savase went there. Since they were informed by Kumar Randive, that the appellant-Audumbar had assaulted him in a car, along with Kumar Randive and Satish Savase, they proceeded to Pandharpur to lodge an F.I.R. On the way, in Chincholi village, they found Audumbar standing. They made Audumbar sit in the car and proceeded for police station, Pandharpur. Satish told him that they would lodge an F.I.R. against him. Audumbar expressed his regrets and said that he was prepared to apologies before the villagers. Consequently, the car was brought back to Tungat S.T. stand. From S.T. stand, they forcibly started taking Audumbar to the house of the Police Patil. On the way, in front of the house of Shahaji Saudagar, all of a sudden, the appellants Shivaji and Sharad came on a motor-cycle. They dashed the motor-cycle on the legs of Satish. He fell down as a result thereof. In the meantime, the appellants-Dilip armed with a sword and Dhanaji also came there. Thereafter, all the five appellants, namely Audumbar, who had extracted himself from the clutches of Mahadeo Dithe and Satish Savase, Shivaji, Sharad, Dilip and Dhanaji started inflicting blows with kicks and fists on the person of Satish. Shivaji inflicted a blow with sword-stick on his back. When Mahadeo Dithe tried to intervene, Dhanaji punched him and Dilip threatened him, showing his sword that in case he came near, he would be killed. The said incident was seen in electric light. Thereafter, all the five appellants, are said to have run away.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">15. The manner of the assault, which is contained in the F.I.R., lodged by Mahadeo Dithe, and his and Vithal Gaikwad&#x27;s statement in the trial Court is corroborated by the medical evidence. In this connection, it would be pertinent to refer to the F.I.R., which was lodged within 3 1/2 hours of the incident, and wherein, there is a categorical averment that on receiving a dash from the motor-cycle, of Shivaji, the deceased Satish Savase, had received an injury on his private parts. This is corroborated by the ante-mortem injury No. 9 suffered by the deceased, which was a contusion on his scrotum. Again, in the F.I.R., it is categorically alleged that the appellant-Shivaji assaulted the deceased with a long blade weapon, like a knife, on his back and the post mortem report shows that the ante-mortem injury No. 1 suffered by the deceased, was a stab wound on his back. Again, the averment in the F.I.R. is that all the five appellants, initially assaulted the deceased with kicks and fists, and the ante-mortem injuries Nos. 2 to 8 which were abrasions, were, in the opinion of the Autopsy Surgeon, attributable to kicks and fists. As mentioned above, the manner of assault contained in the F.I.R., has also been deposed to by these two eye-witnesses in their statement in the trial Court.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_42\">16. Assurance is lent to the claim of these witnesses by the circumstance, that F.I.R. of the incident, was lodged very promptly. As mentioned earlier, the incident is alleged to have taken place on 12-4-1992, at 11/11.15 p.m. and the F.I.R. wherein the five appellants are named, was lodged 3 1/2 hours later i.e. at 2.30 a.m. on 13-4-1992. As mentioned earlier, in the said F.I.R. all the essential features of the prosecution case, are mentioned. From the evidence of the informant, it appears that police station, Pandharpur where the F.I.R. was lodged was situated about 12 kms from the place of the incident. Considering the circumstance that the informant and others first took Satish Savase to the Cottage Hospital, Pandharpur and only after he was declared dead there, the informant Dithe, proceeded to police station Pandharpur, and lodged an F.I.R., the F.I.R. in the instant case is certainly a prompt one. Criminal Courts attach great importance to the lodging of a prompt F.I.R. The same diminishes chances of confabulations and concoctions. In our view, this prompt F.I.R. goes a long way in establishing the truthfullness of the prosecution case.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">17. Assurance is also lent to the ocular account by the circumstance that on the place of the incident i.e. in front of Shahaji Saudagar&#x27;s house, the Investigating Officer Shivarkar found blood-stained earth. The said earth was sent to the Chemical Analyst who found blood of &#x27;O&#x27; group namely the blood group of the deceased on earth. This establishes that place of the incident deposed to by the two eye-witnesses was actually the place, where the deceased Savase was assaulted.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1633249\" id=\"span_2\">18. We also feel that the two eye-witnesses must have had no difficulty in recognising the appellants, who were known to them from before because, a perusal of the site plan and their evidence shows that there was electric light near the place of the incident, It shouid also be borne in mind that the appellants and these two eyewitnesses belong to the same village. The Supreme Court in the decision reported in A.I.R. 1965, Supreme Court, page 714, <a href=\"/doc/1633249/\" id=\"a_12\">Kripal Singh v. State of U.P.</a>, in para four has observed that known persons can be identified by the timbre of their voice, gait etc.</span>\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1296255\" id=\"span_3\">19. For the said reasons, in our view, the learned Judge acted correctly in accepting the involvement of the appellants, in the instant crime. We are also of the view that the trial Judge was perfectly justified in convicting the appellant Shivaji under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_13\">section 302</a> I.P.C. simplicitor. In our view, the act of the said appellant, fell squarely within the ambit of Clause Thirdly of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_14\">section 300</a> I.P.C the breach of which, is punishable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_15\">section 302</a> I.P.C. Clause Thirdly of section 300 I.PC., provides that culpable homicide is murder, &quot;if the act is done, with intention of causing bodily injury to any person and the bodily injury intended to be inflicted is sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death&quot;. The Supreme Court in the time honoured decision, , <a href=\"/doc/1296255/\" id=\"a_16\">Virsa Singh v. State of Punjab</a>, in para 12, has held that if the injury caused is the intended injury i.e. not accidentally caused and is sufficient to cause death in the ordinary course of nature, the case would fall under Clause Thirdly of <a href=\"/doc/626019/\" id=\"a_17\">section 300</a> I.P.C. <a href=\"/doc/1296255/\" id=\"a_18\">The said decision</a> of the Supreme Court which, we respectfully follow was considered and followed by the Supreme Court in the case , State of Karnataka -appellant v. Vedanayagam respondent. This is apparent from the observations contained in para 4 of <a href=\"/doc/1296255/\" id=\"a_19\">the said judgment</a>. In the instant case, the evidence of both the eye-witnesses is that appellant-Shivaji intentionally inflicted a blow on the back of the deceased Savase with a sword-stick. The medical evidence in the form of the statement of Dr. Chalak, P.W. 4 is that the stab injury suffered by the deceased on his back was sufficient in the ordinary course of nature to cause death. We find the opinion of Dr. Chalak to be plausible because vital organs like diaphragm peritoneum, kidney and liver were damaged.</span>\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">20. We make no bones in observing that the defence version of the incident is a tissue of lies. We find that in his F.I.R., Audumbar stated that the incident took place at the S.T. stand but, in his statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_20\">section 313</a> Cr.P.C. changed the venue to that alleged by the prosecution. Again, we find that he gave the time of the assault to Dr. Chalak as 9.30 p.m. however, in his statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_21\">section 313</a> Cr.P.C. he changed it to 11/11.15 p.m., the time alleged by the prosecution. In his statement under <a href=\"/doc/767287/\" id=\"a_22\">section 313</a> Cr.P.C. he stated that he had got scared and therefore, had mentioned in his F.I.R, that he was assaulted at the S.T. stand and that he had given the time of his being assaulted by mistake as 9.30 p.m. to the doctor. He has stated in his statement that he realised his mistake only yesterday. In our view, the said change was deliberately made by him in order to overcome the circumstance that blood was found not at the S.T. stand but, in front of Shahaji Saudagar&#x27;s house and to fit in his injuries with the time of the incident.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">There are other reasons as to why we are not inclined to believe Audumbar&#x27;s version. In his F.I.R. he has not mentioned that deceased Satish was assaulted. In the trial Court, the suggestion put to the informant was that the deceased Satish had sustained injuries because he had tried to stop the motor-cycle coming from the village. We have no reservations in rejecting this suggestion for two reasons.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">Firstly, a bare perusal of the stab injury suffered by the deceased would show that it could not be caused in such a manner.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">Secondly, in the cross-examination, we find that no question was put to Dr. Chalak, the Autopsy Surgeon, whether the injuries of the deceased could be caused as a result of collusion with the motorcycle.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_50\">21. This brings us to Criminal Appeal No. 282 of 1994 directed by the State of Maharashtra against acquittal of Audumbar Manohar Randive, Sharad @ Kisan Shivaji Randive, Dhanaji Manohar Randive and Dilip Manohar Randive, for an offence under section 302 r/w 149 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_23\">I.P.C</a>. and Criminal Revision Application No. 91 of 1994 preferred by Mahadev Dithe, P.W. 2 (Original complainant) against the acquittal of the said persons, for the said offence. Both Ms. Pawar, Additional Public Prosecutor, in Criminal Appeal No. 282 of 1994, and Mr. P.N. Patil, in Criminal Revision Application No. 91 of 1994, cried hoarse that the trial Judge grossly erred in acquitting Audumbar, Sharad @ Kisan, Dhanaji and Dilip, for an offence under section 302 r/w 149 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_24\">I.P.C</a>. The short and long of their submission is that after the motorcycle driven by Shivaji struck the deceased Savase he had fallen on the ground, and thereafter when Audumbar along with Sharad, Dhanaji, Dilip and Shivaji launched an assault by kicks and fists on the deceased, they were members of an unlawful assembly within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/15763377/\" id=\"a_25\">section 141</a>, thirdly of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_26\">I.P.C</a>., and that being so, they would be liable for all the acts committed by any of the members of the unlawful assembly; including the act of the appellant Shivaji of inflicting fatal blow with a sword-slick on the back of the deceased, at the fag end of the incident.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">22. To butress her submission, Ms Pawar, Additional Public Prosecutor, invited our attention to the oft-quoted decision of the Supreme Court rendered in the case of Lalji and others. appellants v. State of U.P., respondent, . Ms Pawar, specially invited our attention to the observations contained in para 8 and 10 of <a href=\"/doc/1296255/\" id=\"a_27\">the said judgment</a>. She urged that in para 10, the Supreme Court has observed that the circumstance as to what part was played by the accused, would be immaterial.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1296255\" id=\"span_4\">We have reflected over the submission canvassed by Ms Pawar. To appreciate her submission, a perusal of the observations contained in para 9 of <a href=\"/doc/1296255/\" id=\"a_28\">the said decision</a>, would be necessary. The relevant observations reads thus.</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"> &quot;However, the vicarious liability of the members of the unlawful assembly extends only to the acts done in pursuance of the common object of the unlawful assembly, or to such offences as the members of the unlawful assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">23. A perusal of the passage which we have extracted above, and the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_29\">section 149</a> I.P.C. would show that the vicarious liability of the members of a unlawful assembly, would only extend to acts committed or done :---\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(a) in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly; or \n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">(b) to such offences which each member of the unlawful assembly knew to be likely to be committed in the prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_54\">23-A.    In our view, the murder of the deceased Satish, was neither committed in prosecution of the common object of the unlawful assembly nor can it be said that the members of the unlawful assembly knew that it was likely to be committed. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_55\">24.       It is well-settled that question of common object is a question of fact and not one of law.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">A Division Bench of the Allahabad High Court in the decision reported in 1967 Cri.L.J. 1124, Moti and others, appellants v. State of U.P. respondent, in para 33 has thus observed :--\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\"> &quot;The question as to what was the common object of the unlawful assembly is essentially a question of fact which has to be determined on the facts and circumstances of each case. The motive for the crime, the weapons used in the attack, the conduct of the assailants, both before and at the time of the attack are relevant considerations.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">25. Whether there was common object to commit murder of Satish, or a lessor common object would depend on the facts of the case. In the instant case in our view, the common object of the unlawful assembly, was not to commit murder of Satish. We say this, for the following reasons.:---\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">(a) there was no direct enmity between the appellants and the deceased Satish. The enmity alleged by the prosecution was that whereas Satish Savase, informant and others were supporters of Dinkar Patil, the appellants, were supporters of Prakash Patil. From this enmity, it cannot be concluded that the quantum of the common object was to commit murder of the deceased;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">(b) the appellant-Shivaji, Sharad @ Kisan, Dhanaji and Dilip reached the place of the incident in two seperate instalments, initially with an object of extricating appellant-Audumbar from the clutches of Dithe and Satish. The evidence is that first Shivaji and Sharad on a motor-cycle came and thereafter, though in twinkling of moment, Dhanaji and Dilip, the latter with a sword, came;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">(c) although Dilip was armed with sword and Shivaji was armed with sword-stick, initially these two persons along with Audumbar who had extricated himself from the clutches of Mahadeo Dithe and the deceased Satish Savase, Sharad and Dhanaji inflicted blows with kicks and fists on Satish Savase. If the common object was to commit murder, then there was nothing to prevent Dilip and Shivaji in straight away assaulting Satish, with a sword and a sword-stick respectively. In our judgment, this clinchingly establishes that the common object was not to commit murder of Satish; and \n \n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">d) the act of the appellant Shivaji in inflicting blow with a sword-stick was at the fag end of the incident. In our view, it was an act which was clearly in excess of the common object of the unlawful assembly.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">In this connection, it would also be pertinent to refer to the evidence of two eyewitnesses who say that the appellant Shivaji had taken out a gupti from his waist. The trial Judge was of the view that the other accused may not even be aware that Shivaji was carrying a gupti (sword stick)\n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">26. In our view, the trial Judge acted correctly in holding that the murder of the deceased was not committed in prosecution ot the common object of the unlawful assembly. But the mistake committed by him and a grievous one, too, was that with respect to the assault on the deceased, he convicted accused, other than Shivaji only for an offence under <a href=\"/doc/1011035/\" id=\"a_30\">section 323</a>/<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_31\">149</a> I.P.C., and he completely overlooked the second part of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_32\">section 149</a> I.P.C. which makes members of unlawful assembly culpable if the acts which they knew likely to be committed, were committed.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1772025\" id=\"span_5\">27. The question is can it be said that the members of the unlawful assembly knew that the murder of Satish was likely to be committed. The Allahabad High Court in Division Bench decisions , <a href=\"/doc/1772025/\" id=\"a_33\">Charan Singh v. State</a>, and 1973 Cr.L.J. 1203, Maiyadin &amp; others v. State, has construed the word likely as meaning positive knowledge and not remote possibility. In  supra, the Court observed thus :--</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\"> &quot;Even if the act is an individual act, of one member stand, it is not actually done in prosecution of the common object all the members will be liable for it provided they knew and it must be noted here that positive knowledge is necessary. It is not sufficient to know or that they ought to have or might have known or that they had reason to believe that it might happen that the act was likely to be committed in prosecution of common object. The use of the word &#x27;likely in second part of <a href=\"/doc/105691827/\" id=\"a_34\">section 149</a> implies something more than possibility. A thing is likely to happen only when it will probably happen or may very welt happen.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">In 1973, Cr.L.J. supra, the Court thus observed :---\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\"> &quot;The use of the word &#x27;Likely&#x27; in the second part of the section means some clear evidence that the unlawful assembly had such a knowledge.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"973495\" id=\"span_6\">28. The said decisions have been followed in a Division Bench decision of our own Court to which one of us (Vishnu Sahai, J.) was a party in the case  <a href=\"/doc/973495/\" id=\"a_35\">State of Maharashtra v. Irphan Khudada Bardi and others</a>. In <a href=\"/doc/973495/\" id=\"a_36\">the said decision</a>, construing the word &#x27;likely&#x27; as used in <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_37\">section 149</a> I.P.C., the Division Bench observed in para 27 thus :---</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\"> &quot;The expression likely as used in <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_38\">section 149</a> I.P.C. means an imminent likelihood of the happening of a thing or positive knowledge in respect of its happening. A thing is likely to happen if there was every likelihood of its happening. Likely as used in <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_39\">section 149</a> I.P.C. means only a shade short of a certainty. It does not contemplate of a distant likelihood or of a remote possibility of the happening of a thing or event. We wish to emphasise that under the garb of word likely members of an unlawful assembly would not be liable., as is often assumed, for all or any acts, committed by any member of the unlawful assembly,&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">29. The question, is can it be said that the five accused, all members of the unlawful assembly, had the positive knowledge or imminent likelihood, only a shade short of a certainty, of the fact that the deceased Satish would be killed. Our answer is in the negative.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">In this connection apart from the circumstances mentioned in para 25 it would be pertinent to bear in mind the evidence of the eye-witnesses who say that the sword-stick was taken out by Shivaji from his waist, and also the observations of the trial Judge, in para 28, of the impugned judgment that other accused persons, did not know that Shivaji was carrying a sword-stick.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_65\">30. Be that as it may, one thing is crystal clear and that is when the five appellants, were conjointly assaulting the deceased with fists and kicks, all of them knew that the appellant Dilip was armed with a sword. That being so and even otherwise it can be safely said that they had the knowledge at least that grievous hurt could be caused to the deceased.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">We are fortified in our view, by the decision of the Supreme Court reported in 1975 Cr.L.J. page 249, Ram Anjore and others ...appellants v. The State of Uttar Pradesh respondent. In para 21, the Supreme Court has observed thus :---\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">&quot;Before we part with this case we may remark that when the members of the unlawful assembly were armed with lathis and spears, the common object of which was to assault Ram Palak and Viswanath, the common object may not be to murder Viswanath, the members of the assembly must have known that at least grievous hurt with a sharp cutting weapon was likely to be caused by any member of the assembly in prosecution of the common object. All the appellants other than Ram Kumar could have been convicted by the High Court under section 326 read with <a href=\"/doc/105691827/\" id=\"a_40\">section 149</a> of the Penal Code.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">(Ram Kumar had assaulted the deceased and he was convicted under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_41\">section 302</a> I.P.C.)\n \n\nIn that view of the matter, it can be reasonably held that the members of unlawful assembly knew that grievous hurt as stipulated by <a href=\"/doc/1540253/\" id=\"a_42\">section 326</a> I.P.C. could be caused to the deceased. Hence, the accused persons, other than Shivaji, would not be guilty under section 323 r/w 149 I.P.C. in respect of the assault on the deceased as held by the trial Court, but would be liable under section 326 r/w 149 I.P.C.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">We are reinforced, in our view by the decision of the Supreme Court in the case  Shambhu Nath Singh and others appellants v. State of Bihar, respondent. In the said case, a large number of persons armed with bhalas, gandasas and lathis and one with a gun namely Shambhu Nath Singh, iormed an unlawful assembly the target of which was one Baran Kahar.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_69\">Those armed with lathis, bhalas and gandasas did not assault the deceased. Shambhu Nath Singh fired several rounds on the deceased killing him on the spot. The trial Judge held only Shambhu Nath Singh to be liable under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_43\">section 302</a> I.P.C. simplicitor. He convicted other accused persons for an offence under section 326 r/w 149 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_44\">I.P.C</a>. observing that since they were armed with deadly weapons, they must have known that grievous hurt was likely to be caused. It appears that the Patna High Court upheld the judgment of the trial Court. The Supreme Court endorsed the view of the trial Court and observed in para 6, thus :---\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"886447\" id=\"span_7\">&quot;<a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 149</a> of the Indian Penal Code is declaratory of the vicarious liability of the members of an unlawful assembly for acts done in prosecution of the common object of that assembly or for such offences as the members of the unlawful assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of that object. If an unlawful assembly is formed with the common object of committing an offence, and if that offence is committed in prosecution of the object by any member of the unlawful assembly, all the members of the assembly will be vicariously liable for that offence even if one or more, but not all committed the offence. Again, if an offence is committed by a member of an unlawful assembly, and that offence is one which the members of the unlawful assembly knew to be likely to be committed in prosecution of the common object, every member who had that knowledge will be guilty of the offence so committed. But members of an unlawful assembly may have a community of object upto a certain point, beyond which they may differ in their objects, and the knowledge possessed by each member of what is likely to be committed in prosecution of their common object, may vary not only according to the information at his command, but also according to the extent to which he shares the community of object and as a consequence of this, effect of <a href=\"/doc/999134/\" id=\"a_46\">section 149</a> of the Indian Penal Code may be different on different members of the same unlawful assembly. <a href=\"/doc/886447/\" id=\"a_47\">Jahiruddin v. Queen Empress, I.L.R.</a> 22 Cal. 306.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">31. The question is as to what is the quantum of sentence which should be awarded to the accused Audumbar Randive, Sharad Randive, Dhanaji Randive and Dilip Randive, for the offence under section 326 r/w 149 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_48\">I.P.C</a>. In this connection, it would be pertinent to mention that Ms Pawar, Additional Public Prosecutor like Shylock, wanted her pound of flesh and prayed for a deterrent sentence. Ms. Dere on the other hand, in her very mild, but equally effective advocacy submitted that considering the circumstances in which the incident took place a token sentence would be conducive to the ends of justice. We have weighed the rival submissions. In our view, considering the circumstances in which the incident took place and bearing in mind that no personal vendetta was involved and the initial object was to extricate the accused Audumbar from the clutches of Mahadev Dithe and Satish Savase, who were abducting him and also keeping in mind that these accused persons only assaulted the deceased with kicks and fists, and the accused Dilip though armed with sword, did not assault the deceased with it, we feel that a jail sentence of one year R.I. coupled with a fine of Rs. 5,000/- in default a sentence of 6 months R.I. would meet, the ends of justice.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_71\">32. We now, propose considering the submissions canvassed by the learned Counsel for the appellants, namely Mr. Adhik Shirodkar and Ms Revati Mohite-Dere. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_72\">Mr. Shirodkar firstly contended that the appellant-Audumbar had sustained injuries in the same incident wherein the deceased Satish. was killed and the said injuries of Audumbar have not been explained by the prosecution witnesses. In his contention, two of the inferences to which, non-explanation of the injuries of Audumbar may give rise to are ;---\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">(a) the prosecution is suppressing the genesis of the incident;\n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">(b) the eye-witnesses are lying on a material particular.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_73\">He also contended that non-explanation ot Audumbar&#x27;s injuries may show that the appellants acted in exercise of right of private defence of person. In this connection, he pointed out that the appellant Audumbar had lodged an F.I.R. with respect to same incident on 13-4-1992 at 1.45 p.m. on the basis of which, a case under section 323 r/ w 34 <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_49\">I.P.C</a>., was registered against Mahadev Dithe, P.W. 2, Vithal Gaikwad, P.W. 3, the deceased Satish Savase and Kumar Randive. He also pointed out that the injuries of Audumbar, were medically examined the same day at 6.30 p.m. by Dr. Chalak, P.W. 4.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">It is true that Audumbar was medically examined at the said time by Dr. Chalak who found the following injuries on his person :---\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">  (1) C.L.W. on left parietal region: 1 1/2 &quot;x 1/4&quot; x muscle deep\n   (2) Contusion over right arm 1 &quot;x1&quot;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">   (3) Abrasion over right elbow, 1 cm. x 1 cm.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">   (4) Contusion over right renal area 2&quot; x 2&quot;.\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">33. But we find no merit in the said submission of Mr. Shirodkar. The Supreme Court in the case  Bhaba Nanda Sharma and others, appellant v. The State of Assam, respondent, in para 2, has observed that the prosecution is only enjoined in law to explain the injuries received by the accused if they have been caused in the same incident.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_76\">We are extracting the following observations contained in the said para :---\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\"> &quot;In a case of this nature, before an adverse inference is drawn against the prosecution for its alleged suppression or failure to explain the injuries on the person of an accused, it must be reasonably shown that in all probability, the injuries were caused to him in the same occurrence or as a part of the same transaction in which the victims on the side of the prosecution were injured.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">In the instant case, it is crystal clear that the injuries to Audumbar were not caused in the incident, wherein Satish was killed but, in the incident which took place at the S.T. stand, two hours earlier. It would be useful to refer to the evidence of Mahadev Dithe, P.W. 2, who in his cross-examination has stated that when they reached near village Chincholi they took Audumbar in a car and he had sustained an injury on his head. Again, it is pertinent to mention that at the time of his medical examination the history of assault given by Audumbar to Dr. Chalak was that &quot;the alleged assault on 12-4-1992, at 9.30 p.m.&quot; Since the incident took place at 11/11-15 a.m., it is crystal clear that the injuries to Audumbar were not caused during the same incident wherein Satish Savase was killed.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_78\">34. Mr. Shirodkar secondly urged that even accepting the prosecution case as it is, the appellants had a right of private defence of person, and at the most, it can be said that the appellant Shivaji exceeded the right. He further urged that the evidence of eye-witnesses shows that Audumbar was being forcibly taken by them and Satish Savase, and that being so, the appellants were justified, in assaulting him. We regret that we do not find any merit in this contention. The evidence of the eye-witnesses is that after the appellant-Shivaji had given a dash with a motor-cycle to Satish, the latter fell down and in that position, all the appellants, including Audumbar, assaulted Satish.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">It is well-settled that right of private defence is a preventive right and not a punitive one. A perusal of <a href=\"/doc/1985227/\" id=\"a_50\">section 102</a> I.P.C., would show that once apprehension ceases, the right ceases. After Satish had fallen down, and Audumbar had freed himself and thereafter, joined in the assault along with other appellants, on the deceased who was lying down on the ground, there was no question of right of private defence of person being available to the appellants.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\">Hence, this submission of Mr. Shirodkar is rejected.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_81\">35. Thirdly, Mr, Shirodkar urged that the prosecution has failed to prove the incident which took place about two hours prior to the main incident wherein Satish Savase was killed. In his contention, the failure of the prosecution to prove it, would prove lethal to its case. He contended that the evidence of Mahadev Dithe, P.W. 2 and Vithal Gaikwad P.W. 3 who have proved the earlier incident, is purely hear-say. He is right when he urged this.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_82\">He urged that Kumar Randive was a witness whose evidence was essential to prove it and his non-production by the prosecution is fatal. We regret that we cannot accede to his contention. It should be borne in mind as urged by Ms Pawar, that in the counter- F.I.R. of the incident, which was lodged by Audumbar, this incident is admitted.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_83\">At any rate, in our view, for the failure of the prosecution to prove it, the ocular account in respect of the main incident which is without any blemish, cannot be rejected.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_84\">36. Fourthly, Mr. Shirodkar urged that the F.I.R. of the incident was ante-timed. He pointed out that the remand yadi Exhibit 59 which was prepared on the basis of the F.I.R. by P.S.I. Shivarkar, shows that the appellant-Audumbar and not appellant Shivaji, gave a blow with a sword stick to Satish. in this connection, it should be borne in mind that the remand yadi was prepared on 14-4-1992, and the F.I.R. according to the prosecution was lodged on 13-4-1992 at 2.30 a.m. and according to the suggestion given by the defence, which was baseless it was lodged on the evening of 13-4-1992. In other words, even according to the defence suggestion, the F.I.R. was already in existence when the remand yadi was prepared. Evidence of P.S.I. Shivarkar is that on his dictation, the remand yadi was prepared by constable Vilas Pawar. What appears to us is that constable Vilas Pawar, who prepared the remand yadi, made a clerical error in mentioning in the remand yadi that the appellant Audumbar gave a blow with a sword-stick on the deceased.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">The Supreme Court in the case , Chandrakant Laxman ..appellant v. State of Maharashtra...respondent, in para 10, has observed that if some apparent inconsistencies, crop up, as a result of &quot;remissness on the part of the Investigating Officer and not of any improvement or prevarication on the part of the prosecution witnesses, there would be no justification for discarding the accusation.&quot;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_86\">We do not find any merit in the submission of Mr. Shirodkar that initially a different F.I.R., wherein it was mentioned that appellant Audumbar gave a blow with a sword-stick on the back of the deceased was lodged by the informant and later it was substituted by the present F.I.R. because no such suggestion was given to P.S.I. Shivarkar. In the absence of the same, we cannot hold this.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">37. Fifthly, Mr. Shirodkar urged that both the witnesses are highly interested and although independent witnesses were there, they are not examined. The law as we understand is that the testimony of an interested witness is not mechanically rejected on that score but, is only evaluated with caution. We have exercised the necessary caution and have found, for the reasons mentioned in the earlier part of our judgment, that the testimony of both the witnesses inspires confidence.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">Mere circumstance that if some witnesses present, were not examined, would not wash-off the weighty ocular account given by the two eye-witnesses, Mahadev Dithe and Vithal Gaikwad  \n \n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_89\">38. Sixthly, Mr. Shirodkar learned Counsel for the appellant, urged that there were vital omissions in the statement of eye-witnesses under <a href=\"/doc/447673/\" id=\"a_51\">section 161</a> Cr.P.C. and the F.I.R., and therefore, these witnesses, could not be believed. In this connection, we may mention two things :---\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_90\">We may first mention that so far as Mahadev Dithe is concerned, many of the so called omissions put to him, were not in fact omissions but, were mentioned in the F.I.R. as pointed out by Mrs. Pawar. The remaining omissions in our judgment, are innocuous. The Supreme Court in the decision  Matadin and others...appellants v. State of U.P. respondent, in para 3, has observed that \n &quot;where the omissions are vital they merit consideration, but mere small omissions will not justify a finding by a Court that the witnesses concerned are self-contained liars.&quot;\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_91\">39. Lastly, Mr. Shirodkar urged that no offence under <a href=\"/doc/1560742/\" id=\"a_52\">section 302</a> I.P.C. simplicitor is made out against the appellant Shivaji. He contended that had the appellant intended to commit the murder of Satish, then initially, he would not have inflicted blows with kicks and fists but would have assaulted him with a gupti straightaway. He contended that in such a situation the circumstance that the appellant Shivaji gave a solitary blow to the deceased, would make out only an offence under <a href=\"/doc/409589/\" id=\"a_53\">section 304</a> I.P.C. against him. He also urged that such a blow may have landed accidently on the back of the deceased.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_92\">We regret for the reasons contained in paragraph 19, we have to reject this submission.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_93\">40. Ms Dere, not only adopted alt the aforesaid contentions canvassed by Mr. Shirodkar but, also canvassed one which appeared to be very attractive on the first blush. She urged that in the instant case, the prosecution has changed the place of the incident. In this connection, she invited our attention to the F.I.R. wherein it is mentioned that the incident took place near Maruti temple. She thereafter, invited our attention to the statements of the two eye-witnesses, where in their examination-in-chief, they have stated that the incident took place in front of the house of Shahaji Saudagar. She urged that the said change was necessitated because blood was found by the Investigating Officer in front of the house of Shahaji Saudagar.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">We have reflected over her submission and find it to be without merit. A perusal of the cross-examination of the informant Mahadev Dithe, (para 14) would show that the distance between the house of Shahaji Saudagar and Maruti temple would be about 100 ft. Apart from the fact that in view of this, very short distance, there is practically no difference between the expression near Maruti temple and the house of Shahaji Saudagar. We find that in the site plan, which was prepared by the Investigating Officer, at about 9 a.m. next morning, it has been shown that the cap of Shivaji and sandle of Audumbar were found near the house of Shahaji Saudagar. In such a situation, submission of Ms. Pawar, Additional Public Prosecutor that the two places in sum and substance, are the same, appears to be tenable. In our view, Ms. Pawar, is right. When she urges that the place of the incident, can both be described as near Maruti temple and in front of the house of Shahaji Saudagar. Hence, we reject the\nsaid contention of Ms Dere.\n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_95\">41.        In the result, these four connected matters are decided in the following manner:-\n</p>  \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">(A) CRIMINAL APPEAL NO. 246 of 1994 \n \n\npreferred by the appellant Shivaji Mukund Randive is dismissed.
