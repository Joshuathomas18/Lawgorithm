He submitted that relief\n\twhich has been granted by Industrial Tribunal, Baroda in favour of\n\tseven workmen, those who were contractor workmen. It is made clear\n\tby him that award is not so far implemented by petitioner till date\n\tand these workmen are out of job since 5/10/1999.

However, permission is granted by this Court and\n\tpetition shall stand disposed of as withdrawn. Meaning thereby that\n\tchallenge to award 22/10/2003 has been withdrawn and accordingly\n\tpetition has been disposed of as withdrawn.  This Court has granted\n\tpermission to withdraw present petition  but this Court has not\n\tgranted any liberty to petitioner to file appropriate proceeding\n\tbefore Industrial Tribunal by way of Review application.  So,\n\tliberty from this Court is atleast relevant and necessary for\n\tkeeping right open to challenge of award dated 22/10/2003. Once\n\tpetition is withdraw challenging award in question subsequent to\n\tchallenge same award by present petition and liberty was not given\n\tby this Court, to challenge same award after order in Reviwe\n\tapplication then according to my opinion, petitioner is not entitled\n\tto challenge same award by another present petition after withdrawal\n\tof petition which was disposed of as withdrawn.\n</p>\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">Therefore,\n\tin present petition petitioner can only challenge order passed in\n\tReview application by Industrial Tribunal, Baroda but petitioner is\n\tnot entitled to challenge award passed by Industrial Tribunal,\n\tBaroda dated 22/10/2003.\n</p>\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">Learned\n\tadvocate Mr. Mehta fairly has not made any submission against order\n\tpassed by Industrial Tribunal in Review application because in\n\t<a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_1\">Industrial Dispute Act</a> as well as Industrial Dispute Rules, 1966\n\tthere is no express provisions made by Statutory provision which\n\tgives power to Industrial Tribunal to consider or to entertain\n\tReview Application.

The Labour Court or\n\tIndustrial Tribunal has no power to review its own award/order. \n\tThere is no express provision made under provision of <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_3\">Industrial\n\tDispute Act</a>, which give express Statutory powers to review in favour\n\tof Labour Court or Industrial Tribunal.</span>  \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1992752\" id=\"span_2\">The\n\tIndustrial Tribunal has considered another decision of Jharkhand\n\tHigh Court reported in 2004 (1) LLN 1144, where also it has been\n\tdecided that under provision of <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_4\">Industrial Dispute Act</a>, there is no\n\tsuch power has been given to Industrial Tribunal to review its own\n\torder/award and such powers can not be exercised by Industrial\n\tTribunal as inherent power of Court.  The Industrial Tribunal can\n\tcorrect only arithmetical mistake or accidental mistake but not\n\thaving jurisdiction to re-examine facts which goes against its\n\tearlier award, for that, such powers are not with Industrial\n\tTribunal.  The Industrial Tribunal has also considered decision of\n\tDelhi High Court reported in 2002 (1) LLN 506 where also it has been\n\theld that Industrial Tribunal has no jurisdiction to review its own\n\taward unless specific provision  or express provision is made for\n\tit. The Industrial Tribunal has also considered decision of Madhya\n\tPradesh High Court reported in 1995 (2) LLN 1075 where it is held\n\tthat so long specific powers of review is not given such powers can\n\tnot be exercised by Industrial Tribunal as inherent power but only\n\ttyping or clerical mistake can be corrected.  The Industrial\n\tTribunal has also considered another decision of Delhi High Court\n\treported in 1995 (1) LLN 111 which was delivered in case of <a href=\"/doc/6559712/\" id=\"a_5\">Workmen\n\tCompensation Act, 1923</a> and in that also Delhi High Court has held\n\tthat Industrial Tribunal and Labour Court has no jurisdiction or\n\tpower to review its own award or order.  The Apex Court in in\n\tthe case of <a href=\"/doc/1992752/\" id=\"a_6\">P. N. Thakershi Vs. Pradhyumansinghji</a> reported in AIR\n\t1970 SC 1273 also held it that power of review is not\n\tinherent power but it must be given expressly by Statutory\n\tprovision. Therefore, in absence of that, Industrial Tribunal has no\n\tjurisdiction to review its own award.  The Industrial Tribunal has\n\tconsidered Rule 31 of I. D. Rules, 1966 which relating to only\n\tcorrection in clerical or typing or accidental mistake but not given\n\tpower of review under Rule 31 of Industrial Dispute Rules.</span>  \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">The\n\tIndustrial Tribunal has come to conclusion that such application,\n\twhich has been filed by petitioner to review its own award, was\n\tearlier decided by Industrial Tribunal in reference ITC no. 17/2002\n\ton merits. After closing right to lead evidence by Corporation,\n\tdetailed argument has been made, at that occasion, Corporation was\n\taware about facts that they have not led any oral evidence and right\n\tto lead oral evidence has not been availed and left it voluntarily\n\tthen subsequently application which has been filed by petitioner\n\tCorporation to give him an opportunity to fill up Lecuna or gape\n\tthat request can not consider to be legal and reasonable.  If such\n\tpermission is granted by Court in Review application then workers\n\tmay not be able to get final adjudication in such matter and\n\tremained continuous litigation by such kind of application.  For\n\tthat, there is no such provision made in <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_7\">Industrial Disputes\n\tAct</a>/Rules.  The Industrial Tribunal has rightly observed that award\n\tis dated 22/10/2003, more than six years have passed but\n\tunfortunately, workers are not able to get fruit of such award. \n\tWhatever delay has been occurred was considered to be deliberated as\n\tintentional and once matter has been decided on merits no review\n\tapplication can be entertained, for that, industrial Tribunal has no\n\tjurisdiction and power to entertain it.\n</p>\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"527344\" id=\"span_3\">The\n\tview taken by Apex Court in bench of three judges in case of <a href=\"/doc/527344/\" id=\"a_8\">Kapra\n\tMajdur Akta Union Vs.

The Award is a\n\tdetailed reasoned Award.  The Tribunal took note of the background\n\tin which the disputes had arisen and the reference made to it.  It\n\trejected the argument of the appellant-Union that once a reference\n\tis made, the Labour Department of the appropriate Government becomes\n\tfunctus officio in the matter.

It noticed the fact that in the instant case a notice\n\tof strike was given on February 14, 1983 and a notice of closure of\n\ta part of the undertaking on April 4, 1983.  The workers were\n\tdisturbed and the atmosphere was surcharged. In this background if\n\tthe Conciliation Officer intervened in an attempt to bring about a\n\tsettlement, it cannot be contended that he had no jurisdiction to do\n\tso.  In fact the Labour Department was not only justified but\n\tlegally competent and compelled to set the conciliation proceedings\n\tin motion so as to restore industrial peace.  \n</blockquote>\t\n\t \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\t9.\tHaving found\n\tthat the settlement was brought about in the course of conciliation\n\tproceedings, the Tribunal considered the terms of settlement and\n\trecorded the following conclusion :-\n</blockquote>\t \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">\t&quot;I have\n\tcarefully gone through the terms of the settlement.

I find the settlement fair and\n\tjust.&quot;\n</blockquote>\t \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">\t10.\tThe\n\tTribunal, therefore, concluded that the settlement of  May 17, 1983\n\twas a settlement reached between the Workmen and the Management in\n\tthe course of conciliation proceedings and hence binding on all the\n\tworkers of the respondent-Company.  It proceeded to decide the\n\treference declaring that the disputes stood settled as between the\n\tparties by a valid and binding settlement dated May 17, 1983 and\n\tthus the reference had been rendered redundant.  There was no\n\tdispute surviving and no purpose was left in making the terms of a\n\tvalid and binding settlement of 1983 as a part of the award, as all\n\tthe agreed terms should stood executed and implemented.  The order\n\tof the Industrial Tribunal making the Award is of June 12, 1987. \n\tThe said Award was duly published by the appropriate Government in\n\tthe Gazette on August 10, 1987.\n</p>\t \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">\t11.\tOn September\n\t7, 1987 the appellant-Union filed an application before the\n\tIndustrial Tribunal to the effect that the only question which had\n\tbeen argued before the Tribunal was in relation to the power and\n\tjurisdiction of the Conciliation Officer to record settlement\n\tbetween the parties during the pendency of the disputes.  The\n\tquestion as to whether the settlement was fair and just, and should\n\tbe accepted by the Tribunal, was not argued since that required\n\tevidence.  It was, therefore, understood that the said question will\n\tbe decided later on in case the Tribunal held that the Conciliation\n\tOfficer had jurisdiction to record the settlement.  Under some\n\tmisconception the Tribunal had determined the terms of the\n\tsettlement to be fair and just and had passed an Award on June 12,\n\t1987.  It was, therefore, prayed that the appellant-Union be given\n\tan opportunity to establish that the settlement was neither just nor\n\tfair. For this purpose the Award may be recalled and the\n\tappellant-Union be given an opportunity to establish that the\n\tsettlement is unjust and unfair, adversely affecting a large number\n\tof workmen.  It was prayed that the Award may be recalled which was\n\tin fact an ex-parte Award, and the question of fairness of the\n\tsettlement be decided after providing an opportunity to the parties\n\tto produce evidence.  \t\n</p>\t \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1331078\" id=\"span_7\">12.This\n\tapplication filed by the appellant-Union was strongly opposed by the\n\trespondent-Management, but the successor Presiding Officer of\n\tIndustrial Tribunal No.II, Delhi allowed the application.  It\n\tobserved that a perusal of the order dated June 12, 1987 showed that\n\tthe then Tribunal did not make a single observation as to whether\n\tthe settlement dated May 17, 1983 was just and fair.  No issue was\n\tframed nor any evidence was recorded on that point.  No argument was\n\tadvanced and no finding was given by his learned predecessor on this\n\tpoint.  Relying upon the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/1331078/\" id=\"a_12\">Satnam Verma  vs.\n\t Union of India</a> :  1984 (supp) SCC 712 and Grindlays Bank Ltd. vs. \n\tCentral Government Industrial Tribunal and others : 1980 (Supp) SCC\n\t420  it was held that where the Tribunal proceeds to make an Award\n\twithout notice to a party, the Award is a nullity and, therefore,\n\tthe Tribunal has not only the power but also the duty to set aside\n\tsuch an ex-parte Award.  It was held that in the instant case no\n\targuments were advanced and no finding was given as to whether the\n\tsettlement was just and fair.  In view of its finding that the\n\tTribunal has power to review its Award even if the same is published\n\tin the Gazette, the Tribunal proceeded to exercise its power to\n\treview its earlier order dated June 12, 1987.  It further framed an\n\tadditional issue which is as follows:- &quot;Whether the settlement\n\tdated 17.5.1983 is just and fair and if so, is it not binding on the\n\tparties?&quot;</span>\n</p>\t \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">\t13.\tIt further\n\tdirected that only arguments shall be heard since there was no need\n\tto record evidence on this point.  Accordingly by its order of\n\tFebruary 19, 1990 the Industrial Tribunal decided to review its\n\tearlier order and framed an additional issue as to whether the\n\tsettlement was just and fair.\n</blockquote>\t \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">\t14.\tThe\n\tManagement - respondent herein preferred a writ petition before the\n\tHigh Court of Delhi at New Delhi and sought quashing of the order\n\tdated February 19, 1990 passed by Industrial Tribunal No. II, Delhi,\n\tand for declaration that the Award dated June 12, 1987 earlier made\n\tby the Tribunal effectively terminated the reference pending before\n\tit.  The High Court by its impugned judgment and order allowed the\n\twrit petition and granted the reliefs prayed for. The judgment and\n\torder of the High Court has been impugned before us in this appeal.\n</blockquote>\t \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">\t15.\tThe core\n\tquestion which arises for consideration is whether the Industrial\n\tTribunal was justified in recalling the earlier Award made on June\n\t12, 1987 and in framing an additional issue for adjudication by the\n\tTribunal.  According to the appellant the recall of the order was\n\tfully justified in the facts of the case, while the respondents\n\tcontend to the contrary.  Two issues arise for our consideration\n\twhile considering the legality and propriety of the Tribunal in\n\trecalling its earlier Award. Firstly - whether the Tribunal had\n\tjurisdiction to recall its earlier order which amounted virtually to\n\ta review of its earlier order; and secondly -  whether the Tribunal\n\thad no jurisdiction to entertain the application for recall as it\n\thad become functus offico.  The High Court answered the first\n\tquestion in favour of the respondent-Management and the second in\n\tfavour of the appellant.  \n</blockquote>\t\n\t \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1136885\" id=\"span_8\">16.\tWe shall\n\tfirst take up the second question namely # whether the Tribunal was\n\tfunctus offico having earlier made an Award which was published by\n\tthe appropriate Government.   It is not in dispute that the Award\n\twas made on June 12, 1987 and was published in the Gazette on August\n\t10, 1987.  The application for recall was made on September 7, 1987.\n\t Under sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1216362/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 17A</a> of the Act an Award becomes\n\tenforceable on the expiry of 30 days from the date of its\n\tpublication under <a href=\"/doc/678364/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 17</a> of the Act.  Thus the Award would have\n\tbecome enforceable with effect from September 9, 1987.  However, the\n\tapplication for recalling the Award was made on September 7, 1987\n\ti.e. 2 days before the Award would have become enforceable in terms\n\tof sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/1216362/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 17A</a> of the Act.  The High Court\n\trightly took the view that since the application for recall of the\n\torder was made before the Award had become enforceable, the Tribunal\n\thad not become fuctus offico and had jurisdiction to entertain the\n\tapplication for recall.  This view also find supports from the\n\tjudgment of this Court in  <a href=\"/doc/1136885/\" id=\"a_16\">Grindlays Bank Ltd. vs.  Central\n\tGovernment Industrial Tribunal and others</a> (supra).

The expression &#x27;review&#x27;\n\tis used in the two distinct senses, namely (1) a procedural review\n\twhich is either inherent or implied in a court or Tribunal to set\n\taside a palpably erroneous order passed under a mis-apprehension by\n\tit, and (2) a review on merits when the error sought to be corrected\n\tis one of law and is apparent on the face of the record.  It is in\n\tthe latter sense that the court in <a href=\"/doc/1992752/\" id=\"a_29\">Patel Narshi Thakershi</a> case held\n\tthat no review lies on merits unless a statute specifically provides\n\tfor it.  Obviously when a review is sought due to a procedural\n\tdefect, the inadvertent error committed by the Tribunal must be\n\tcorrected ex debita justitiae to prevent the abuse of its process,\n\tand such power inheres in every court or Tribunal&quot;.</span>\n</blockquote>\t \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">\t20.\tApplying\n\tthese principles it is apparent that where a Court or quasi judicial\n\tauthority having jurisdiction to adjudicate on merit proceeds to do\n\tso, its judgment or order can be reviewed on merit only if the Court\n\tor the quasi judicial authority is vested with power of review by\n\texpress provision or by necessary implication.  The procedural\n\treview belongs to a different category.  In such a review, the Court\n\tor quasi judicial authority having jurisdiction to adjudicate\n\tproceeds to do so, but in doing so commits a procedural illegality\n\twhich goes to the root of the matter and invalidates the proceeding\n\titself, and consequently the order passed therein. Cases where a\n\tdecision is rendered by the Court or quasi judicial authority\n\twithout notice to the opposite party or under a mistaken impression\n\tthat the notice had been served upon the opposite party, or where a\n\tmatter is taken up for hearing and decision on a date other than the\n\tdate fixed for its hearing, are some illustrative cases in which the\n\tpower of procedural review may be invoked.  In such a case the party\n\tseeking review or recall of the order does not have to substantiate\n\tthe ground that the order passed suffers from an error apparent on\n\tthe face of the record or any other ground which may justify a\n\treview.  He has to establish that the procedure followed by the\n\tCourt or the quasi judicial authority suffered from such illegality\n\tthat it vitiated the proceeding and invalidated the order made\n\ttherein, inasmuch the opposite party concerned was not heard for no\n\tfault of his, or that the matter was heard and decided on a date\n\tother than the one fixed for hearing of the matter which he could\n\tnot attend for no fault of his.  In such cases, therefore, the\n\tmatter has to be re-heard in accordance with law without going into\n\tthe erit of the order passed.  The order passed is liable to be\n\trecalled and reviewed not because it is found to be erroneous, but\n\tbecause it was passed in a proceeding which was itself vitiated by\n\tan error of procedure or mistake which went to the root of the\n\tmatter and invalidated the entire proceeding.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1136885\" id=\"span_19\">In <a href=\"/doc/1136885/\" id=\"a_30\">Grindlays Bank\n\tLtd. vs. Central Government Industrial Tribunal and others</a> (supra),\n\tit was held that once it is established that the respondents were\n\tprevented from appearing at the hearing due to sufficient cause, it\n\tfollowed that the matter must be re-heard and decided again.</span>\n</p>\t \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_18\">\t21.\tThe facts of\n\tthe instant case are quite different.  The recall of the Award of\n\tthe Tribunal was sought not on the ground that in passing the Award\n\tthe Tribunal had committed any procedural illegality or mistake of\n\tthe nature which vitiated the proceeding itself and consequently the\n\tAward, but on the ground that some mattes which ought to have been\n\tconsidered by the Tribunal were not duly considered.  Apparently the\n\trecall or review sought was not a procedural review, but a review on\n\tmerits.  Such a review was not permissible in the absence of a\n\tprovision in the Act conferring the power of review on the Tribunal\n\teither expressly or by necessary implication. \n</p>\t \n\n\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">In\n\tview of aforesaid observations made by Apex Court, learned advocate\n\tMr. Mehta, has not argued or raised any contention before this Court\n\tagainst order of Industrial Tribunal passed in Review Application\n\tdated 15/2/2010 in review ITC no. 2/2009. Therefore, challenged in\n\tpresent petition against order passed by Industrial Tribunal in\n\tReview application is apparently failed as no contention has been\n\traised by learned advocate Mr. Mehta fairly and rightly because that\n\tissue has been covered by Apex Court in case of Kapra as <a href=\"/doc/1136885/\" id=\"a_31\">referred\n\tabove</a>.  \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">Initially,\n\tpetition was filed being SCA no. 2193/2004 challenging award passed\n\tby Industrial Tribunal dated 22/10/2003, where it has been\n\twithdrawn. At that occasion no liberty has been given by this Court\n\tto challenge very same award by petitioner Corporation subsequent to\n\torder of Industrial Tribunal, which will be passed in review\n\tapplication.  Apart from that, learned advocate Mr. Mehta has argued\n\ton merits and raised contention about question of regularization as\n\tdirect employees those who were appointed without following\n\trecruitment procedure. He raised contention that they were\n\tundisputedly contractor workmen with respondent no. 9 and 10 and\n\tIndustrial Tribunal has come to conclusion that said contract is\n\tsham and bogus  as no document has been produced by petitioner.  In\n\tsuch circumstances, it is a duty of Union to move machinery under\n\t<a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_32\">Labour Contract (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970</a>.  \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">He\n\tsubmitted that respondent has raised industrial dispute on the\n\tground that they were terminated on 5/10/1999 which was referred for\n\tadjudication before Industrial Tribunal, Baroda in reference ITC no.\n\t17/2002.

They had no right to seek regularization in ONGC and\n\tfurther that even if it was assumed that they were working in\n\tprohibited category, they had no right of claiming regularization\n\tsince they were not recruited by following any procedure.  \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_22\">He\n\tsubmitted that Tribunal has not followed decision of Apex Court in\n\tcase of Steel Authority reported in 2001 (7) SCC 1.

The first party before Industrial Tribunal in reference is\n\tONGC and party no. 2 and 3 are Contractor.  In reference, both\n\tcontractors are join as party challenging termination order of seven\n\temployees.  The reference was filed with  a prayer to grant\n\treinstatement with continuity of service with full back wages of\n\tinterim period. This employees were working with Contractors in\n\tprohibited category.  Therefore, they are to be considered as\n\tpermanent employees of Corporation and entitled all benefits as\n\tpermanent employees of Corporation.  \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">The\n\tstatement of claim was filed by workmen and also contention raised\n\tthat contract which was given, was not genuine contract but it was\n\tsham and bogus contract.  Exh 7, reply was filed by Corporation\n\tdenying averment made in statement of claim raising almost same\n\tcontention before Industrial Tribunal by Corporation.  Thereafter,\n\tmatter was heard by Industrial Tribunal.  It is necessary to note\n\tthat in conciliation proceeding and even before Industrial Tribunal,\n\tnone remained present on behalf of petitioner Corporation. The\n\tpetitioner Corporation has not produced any documents.  Even\n\tpetitioner Corporation has not produced contract if it is genuine\n\taccording to Corporation.  According to case of Corporation, these\n\tseven workmen were if employees of contractor then it is a duty of\n\tCorporation to produce relevant record to establish facts before\n\tIndustrial Tribunal that they were employees of Contractor. There\n\twas no license obtained by Contractor and these workmen were working\n\tin prohibited category where contract labour system has been\n\tabolished by Appropriate Government.  The evidence of one workman\n\thas not been challenged in cross examination in respect to aforesaid\n\tfacts and petitioner Corporation has not produced any oral evidence\n\tto establish or prove contention which are raised in written\n\tstatement before Industrial Tribunal, Baroda. \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">On\n\tthe contrary, respondent workmen has produced relevant record exh\n\t13/6 that they are employees of category IV.  On behalf of\n\tpetitioner Corporation no officer was examined before Industrial\n\tTribunal. According to Corporation, certain facts have been admitted\n\tby one workman in cross examination, therefore, there was no need to\n\texamined any officer.  The workmen has not completed continuous\n\tservice of 240 days and their services was not illegally terminated\n\tand they were not employed by Corporation on the basis of\n\tRecruitment Rules. The Industrial Tribunal has considered terms of\n\treference as discussed in para 7 of award. Thereafter, Industrial\n\tTribunal has considered that both contractors have not filed any\n\treply before Industrial Tribunal against statement of claim not only\n\tthat but either of contractor has not remained present before\n\tIndustrial Tribunal, Baroda.  \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_28\">The\n\tIndustrial Tribunal, Baroda has come prima facie opinion that expect\n\treply exh 7 petitioner Corporation has not produced any material\n\tbefore Industrial Tribunal either by documents or by oral evidence. \n\tTherefore, contract which was alleged to be sham and bogus has been\n\testablished by workmen by leading proper evidence as well as\n\tproducing relevant documents before Industrial Tribunal.  \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_29\">On\n\tbehalf of workman, one Pravinbhai Girdharbhai Parmar was examined\n\texh 16, whose evidence has been remained as it is being\n\tunchallenged. He has given evidence on behalf of all workmen as per\n\tpara 6 of his evidence at page 43.  The evidence of Pravinbhai\n\tGirdharbhai Parmar vide exh 16 started from page 41.  According to\n\this evidence, he has supported facts which are stated in statement\n\tof claim.  Initially, he was join on 3/4/1993 in ONGC establishment\n\tTBG.  Thereafter, he was enrolled as contract employee in Assistant\n\tExpert Service, then his name has been sifted in contractor Sun Rise\n\tTyping Class but he was remained continued in service for performing\n\tsame kind of work  as directed by Officer of Corporation. No\n\tdirection has been given by Contractor to him. The nature of work\n\twhich was performed by workmen is discussed in para 4.  According to\n\thim, Mr. G. A. Das - Senior Deputy Director, Mr. K. Ambedkar  \n\tManager of P &amp; A Establishment have given direction to these\n\tworkmen and they were performing same kind of work in similar nature\n\tand manner.  His evidence is not only relating to his personal\n\tevidence but it is relating to in favour of all, covering details of\n\tall workmen those who are concerned in reference.  He has made clear\n\tstatement in chief examination that whatever work performed by him\n\talmost in similar nature of work, was performed by other employees\n\tviz. Shri Amitkumar Haribhai Rohit, Rathod Ganpatbhai Somabhai,\n\tRohit Thakorbhai Somabhai, Parmar Amarsinh Babarbhai, Parmar\n\tSunilbhai Devjibhai and Vasava Gopalbhai Chandubhai.  They all were\n\tworking with him and he knows each one and they are also performing\n\tsame work which has been performed by him in ONGC as employee of\n\tpetitioner corporation.  All workmen were terminated on 5/10/1999\n\tand each workman has completed 240 days continuous service.  Before\n\tthat no notice, notice pay, and retrenchment compensation paid by\n\tpetitioner corporation and his last salary was Rs. 1500/- per month.\n\t After his termination, he has made sincere efforts to get\n\temployment but he was not able to get it.  Similarly, other six\n\tworkmen were also made sincere efforts for getting job but all were\n\tremained unemployed. They are prepared to join duty if petitioner\n\tcorporation is prepared to reinstate them.  The said chief\n\texamination was carried out dated 25/10/2002.  \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">Thereafter,\n\tone advocate Mr. Mahendra Patel has cross examined workman Shri\n\tPravinbhai Girdharbhai Parmar. In cross examination, this question\n\twas not put to him by advocate of petitioner that he was not having\n\tknowledge of other workmen.  On the contrary, he has given his\n\tanswer in cross examination that he is having information and\n\tknowledge about other workmen those who were working with him. \n\tTherefore, contention raised by learned advocate Mr. Mehta that\n\tevidence of one workman exh 16 is not enough to cover facts of other\n\tsix workmen, can not be accepted because looking to evidence of\n\tPravinbhai Girdharbhai Parmar exh 16 not a personal evidence, but it\n\tcovered evidence on behalf of all remaining workmen means common\n\tevidence.  Therefore, it was not necessary to examine other workmen\n\tbefore Industrial Tribunal. Shri Pravinbhai Girdharbhai Parmar\n\texamined vide exh 16 giving detailed evidence in respect to all\n\tother six workmen and in respect to date of termination, date of\n\tjoining and nature of work performed by them.  They were also\n\tremained unemployed inspite of sincere efforts have been made by\n\tthem.  Therefore, contention raised by learned advocate Mr. Mehta\n\tcan not be accepted.  \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">The\n\trespondent workman has produced certain written documents vide exh\n\t12, from that I-card issued by employer is very relevant. The\n\trespondent workman has produced  xerox copy of various cheque and\n\talso certain slips, which were given for taking tea and breakfast. \n\tSimilarly, vide exh 13, passbook has been produced on record. \n\tAgainst which, no evidence has been produced as rebuttal evidence by\n\tpetitioner Corporation and such documents are not disputed by\n\tpetitioner Corporation.\n</p>\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">In\n\tlight of this back ground, Industrial Tribunal has considered that\n\tif according to petitioner Corporation, these workmen were working\n\tunder contractor then they should have to produce license received\n\tby contractor where name of workmen must be there but no such\n\tlicense was produced on record.  Even Corporation was not having any\n\tlicense in prohibited area under Act 1970. Therefore, Corporation\n\thas failed to establish their case by leading proper oral and\n\tdocumentary evidence before Industrial Tribunal.  The Industrial\n\tTribunal has considered evidence which has been produced by workmen\n\tand these workmen were working as an employee in prohibited area not\n\tas an employee of contractor.  The petitioner Corporation is having\n\tpossession of necessary documents but none of documents has been\n\tproduced by Corporation before Industrial Tribunal.  One Shri\n\tPravinbhai Girdharbhai Parmar exh 16 was examined on behalf of all\n\tthe workmen.  Thereafter, considering evidence on record, Industrial\n\tTribunal has come to conclusion that respondent workmen has\n\testablished facts on the basis of documents as well as oral evidence\n\tthat it was not genuine contract in prohibited area and whatever\n\tarrangement was made that was considered to be a paper arrangement. \n\tTherefore, such contract is considered to be Sham and bogus.  In\n\tsuch circumstances, there is no need for workmen to move machinery\n\tunder <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_36\">Labour Contract (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970</a> for\n\tabolishing contract system.  \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">The\n\tIndustrial Tribunal has also come to conclusion on factual aspect\n\tand also considered decision of Apex Court in case of Steel\n\tAuthority of India reported in 2001 LLR 961.  The Industrial\n\tTribunal has considered that I-card given by petitioner corporation\n\tand other relevant documents which has been produced by workmen vide\n\texh 12 and 13, contract system which has been taken as defence was\n\tnot genuine but it was merely paper arrangement and same has been\n\tconsidered to be Sham and bogus.  Therefore, Industrial Tribunal has\n\tdecided only factual aspect of matter and against that no rebuttal\n\tevidence led by petitioner corporation before Industrial Tribunal.\n\tThe workman has established their case properly before Industrial\n\tTribunal and evidence of workman remained unchallenged before\n\tIndustrial Tribunal.  \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">According\n\tto my opinion, when existence of contract between workmen and\n\tcorporation, if it is not established by petitioner corporation then\n\tnaturally, these workmen are considered to be an employee of\n\tpetitioner corporation because existence of contract has not been\n\testablished by petitioner before Industrial Tribunal. The service\n\trendered by each workman has completed more than 240 days continuous\n\tservice. The <a href=\"/doc/1056316/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 25 F </a>of I. D. Act, 1947 has been violated by\n\tpetitioner corporation being an undisputed facts and no gainfully\n\temployment has been proved by petitioner corporation before\n\tIndustrial Tribunal. I have also considered evidence of Shri\n\tPravinbhai Girdharbhai Parmar exh 16 including cross examination.\n</p>\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">The\n\tdecision of Apex Court as relied by learned advocate Mr. Mehta in\n\tSteel Authority of India reported in 2001 (7) SCC 1 and in case of\n\tState of Karnataka Vs.

In his teaties:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">\tDemocracy, Equality and Freedom, Justice Mathew wrote:\n</blockquote>\t \n\t\t \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\"> The\n\t\toriginal concept of employment was that of master and servant.  It\n\t\twas therefore held that a Court will not specifically enforce a\n\t\tcontract of employment.  The law has adhered to the age old rule\n\t\tthat an employer may dismiss the employee at will.  Certainly, an\n\t\temployee can never expect to be completely free to do what he likes\n\t\tto do.  He must face the prospect of discharge for failing or\n\t\trefusing to do his work in accordance with his employer&#x27;s\n\t\tdirections.  Such control by the employer over the employee is\n\t\tfundamental to the employment relationship. But there are\n\t\tinnumerable facets of the employee&#x27;s life that have little or no\n\t\trelevance to the employment relationship and over which the\n\t\temployer should not be allowed to exercise control.  It is no doubt\n\t\tdifficult to draw a line between reasonable demands of an employer\n\t\tand those which are unreasonable as having no relation to the\n\t\temployment itself.  The rule that an employer can arbitrarily\n\t\tdischarge an employee with or without regard to the actuating\n\t\tmotive is a rule settled beyond doubt.  But the rule become settled\n\t\tat the time when the words &#x27;master&#x27; and &#x27;servant&#x27; were taken more\n\t\tliterally than they are now and when, as in early Roman Law, the\n\t\trights of the servant, like the rights of any other member of the\n\t\thousehold, were not his own, but those of his pater familias.  The\n\t\tovertones of this ancient doctrine and discernible in the judicial\n\t\topinion which rationalized the employer&#x27;s absolute right to\n\t\tdischarge the employee.  Such a philosophy of the employer&#x27;s \n\t\tdominion over his employee may have been in tune with the rustic\n\t\tsimplicity of bygone days.  But the philosophy is incompatible with\n\t\tthese days of large, impersonal, corporate employers.  The\n\t\tconditions have not vastly changed and it is difficult to regard\n\t\tthe contract of employment with large scale industries and\n\t\tgovernment scale industries and government enterprises conducted by\n\t\tbodies which are created under special statutes as mere contract of\n\t\tpersonal service.  Where large number of people are unemployed and\n\t\tit is extremely difficult to find employment, an employee who is\n\t\tdischarged from service might have to remain without means of\n\t\tsubsistence for a considerably long time and damages in the shape\n\t\tof wages for a certain period may not be an adequate compensation\n\t\tto the employee for non employment.  In other words, damages would\n\t\tbe a poor substitute for reinstatement.  The traditional rule has\n\t\tsurvived because of the sustenance it received from the law of\n\t\tcontracts.  From the contractual principle of mutuality of\n\t\tobligation, it was reasoned that if the employee can quit has job\n\t\tat will, then so too must the employer have the right to terminate\n\t\tthe relationship for any or no reason.  And there are a number of\n\t\tcases in which even contracts for permanent employment, i.e., for\n\t\tindefinite terms, have been held unenforceable on the ground that\n\t\tthey lack mutuality of obligation.  But these case demonstrate that\n\t\tmutuality is a high sounding phrase of little use as an analytical\n\t\ttool and it would seem clear that mutuality of obligation is not an\n\t\tinexorable requirement and that lack of mutuality is simply, as\n\t\tmany courts have come to recognize, an imperfect way of referring\n\t\tto the real obstacle to enforcing any kind of contractual\n\t\tlimitation on the employer&#x27;s right of discharge, i.e. lack of\n\t\tconsideration.  If there is anything in contract law which seems\n\t\tlikely to advance the present inquiry, it is the growing tendency\n\t\tto protect individuals from contracts of adhesion from overreaching\n\t\tterms often found in standard forms of contract used by large\n\t\tcommercial establishments.  Judicial disfavour of contracts of\n\t\tadhesion has been said to reflect the assumed need to protect the\n\t\tweaker contracting pari against the harshness of the common law and\n\t\tthe abuses of freedom of contract.  The same philosophy seems to\n\t\tprovide an appropriate answer to the argument, which still seems to\n\t\thave some vitality, that  the servant can not complain, as he\n\t\ttakes the employment on the terms which are offered to him.  \n</blockquote>\t\t\n\t\t \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">22.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1776682\" id=\"span_32\">In\n\t\t<a href=\"/doc/1776682/\" id=\"a_71\">Government Branch Press Vs. D. B.

While\n\t\trejecting this plea as wholly misconceived, the Court observed:</span>\n</p>\t\t \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\"> It\n\t\tis borrowed from the archaic common law concept that employment was\n\t\ta matter between the master and servant only.  In the first place,\n\t\tthis rule in its original absolute from is not applicable to\n\t\tgovernment servants.  Secondly, even with regard to private\n\t\temployment, much of it has passed into fossils of time.   this\n\t\trule held the field at the time when the master and servant were\n\t\ttaken more literally than they are now and when, as in early Roman\n\t\tLaw, the rights of the servant, like the rights of any other member\n\t\tof household, were not his own, but those of his pater familias. \n\t\tThe overtones of this ancient doctrine are discernible in the Anglo\n\t\tAmerican jurisprudence of the 18th  century and the\n\t\tfirst half of the 20th century, which retionalised the\n\t\temployer&#x27;s absolute right to discharge the employee.   Such a\n\t\tphilosophy , as pointed out by K. K. Mathew, J.  (vide his\n\t\ttreatise:  Democracy Equality and Freedom , p. 326),  of the\n\t\temployer&#x27;s dominion over his employee may have been in tune with\n\t\tthe rustic simplicity of bygone days.  But that philosophy is\n\t\tincompatible with these days of large, impersonal, corporate\n\t\temployers .    To bring it in tune with vastly changed and\n\t\tchanging socio-economic conditions and mores of the day, much of\n\t\tthis old, antiquated and unjust doctrine has been eroded by\n\t\tjudicial decisions and legislation, particularly in its application\n\t\tto persons in public employment, to whom the Constitutional\n\t\tprotection of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_72\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/609295/\" id=\"a_73\">, 15</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_74\">, 16</a> and <a href=\"/doc/47623/\" id=\"a_75\">311</a> is available.

The developing notions of social justice and the\n\t\texpanding horizon of socio economic justice necessitated statutory\n\t\tprotection to the unequal partner in the industry namely, those who\n\t\tinvest blood and flesh against those who bring in capital.  Moving\n\t\tfrom the days when whim of the employer was suprema lex, the Act\n\t\ttook a modest step to compel by statute the employer to prescribe\n\t\tminimum conditions of service subject to which employment is given.\n\t\t <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_77\">The Act</a> was enacted as its long title shows to require employers\n\t\tin industrial establishments to define with sufficient precision\n\t\tthe conditions of employment under them and to make the said\n\t\tconditions known to workmen employed by them.  The movement was\n\t\tfrom status of contract, the contract being not left to be\n\t\tnegotiated by two unequal persons but statutory imposed.  If this\n\t\tsocially beneficial Act was enacted for ameliorating the conditions\n\t\tof the weaker partner, conditions of service prescribed thereunder\n\t\tmust receive such interpretation as to advance the intendment\n\t\tunderlying the Act and defeat the mischief. \n</blockquote>\t\t \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">23.\tOf\n\t\tlate, there has been a visible shift in the courts approach in\n\t\tdealing with the cases involving the interpretation of social\n\t\twelfare legislations.  The attractive mantras of globalization and\n\t\tliberalisation are fast becoming the raison d&#x27;etre of the judicial\n\t\tprocess and an impression has been created that the constitutional\n\t\tcourts are no longer sympathetic towards the plight of industrial\n\t\tand unorganized workers.  In large number of cases like the present\n\t\tone, relief has been denied to the employees falling in the\n\t\tcategory of workmen, who are illegally retrenched from service by\n\t\tcreating by lanes and side lanes in the jurisprudence developed by\n\t\tthis Court in three decades.  The stock plea raised by the public\n\t\temployer in such cases is that the initial employment/engagement of\n\t\tthe workman employee was contrary to some or the other statute or\n\t\tthat reinstatement of the workman will put unbrearable burden on\n\t\tthe financial health of the establishment. The courts have readily\n\t\taccepted such plea unmindful of the accountability of the wrong\n\t\tdoer and indirectly punished the tiny beneficiary of the wrong\n\t\tignoring the fat that he may have continued in the employment for\n\t\tyears together and that micro wages earned by him may be the only\n\t\tsource of his livelihood.  It need no emphasis that if a man is\n\t\tderived of his livelihood, he is deprived of all his fundamental\n\t\tand constitutional rights and for him the goal of social and\n\t\teconomic justice, equality of status and of opportunity the\n\t\tfreedoms enshrined in the Constitution remain illusory.  Therefore,\n\t\tthe approach of the courts must be compatible with the\n\t\tconstitutional philosophy of which the Directive Principles of\n\t\tState Policy constitute an integral part and justice due to the\n\t\tworkman should not be denied by entertaining the specious and\n\t\tuntenable grounds put forward by the employer   public or\n\t\tprivate.\n</p>\t\t \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">24.In\n\t\tthe result, the appeal is allowed.

As noticed\n\tabove, SAIL did not specifically deal with the legal position as to\n\twhen a dispute is brought before the Industrial Adjudicator as to\n\twhether the contract labour agreement is sham, nominal and merely a\n\tcamouflage, when there is no prohibition notification under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_119\">section\n\t10(1)</a> of CLRA Act.</span>\n</blockquote>\t \n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">\t20.\tBut where\n\tthere is no abolition of contract labour under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_120\">section 10</a> of CLRA\n\tAct, but the contract labour contend that the contract between\n\tprincipal employer and contractor is sham and nominal, the remedy is\n\tpurely under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_121\">ID Act</a>, the principles in Gujarat Electricity Board\n\tcontinue to govern the issue.  The remedy of the workmen is to\n\tapproach the industrial adjudicator for an adjudication of their\n\tdispute that they are the direct employees of the principle employer\n\tand the agreement is sham, nominal and merely a camouglage, even\n\twhen there is no order under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_122\">section 10(1)</a> of CLRA Act.  The\n\tIndustrial adjudicator can grant the relief sough if it finds that\n\tcontract between principal employer and the contractor is sham,\n\tnominal and merely a camouflage to deny employment benefits to the\n\temployer and that there is in fact a direct employment, by applying\n\ttests like: who pays the salary; who has the power to remove/dismiss\n\tfrom service to initiate disciplinary action; who can tell the\n\temployee the way in which the work should be done, in short who has\n\tdirection and control over the employee.  But where there is no\n\tnotification under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_123\">section 10</a> of the CLRA Act and where it is not\n\tproved in the industrial adjudication that the contract was\n\tsham/nominal and camouflage, then the question of directing the\n\tprincipal employer to absorb or regularize the services of the\n\tcontract labour does not arise.  The tests that are applied to find\n\tout whether a person is an employee or an independent contract may\n\tnot automatically apply in finding out whether the contract labour\n\tagreement is a sham, nominal and is a mere camouflage.  For example,\n\tif the contract is for supply of labour, necessarily, the labour\n\tsupplied by the contractor will work under the directions,\n\tsupervision and control of the principal employer but that would not\n\tmake the worker a direct employee of the principal employer, if the\n\tsalary is paid by contractor, if the right to regulate employment is\n\twith the contractor, and the ultimate supervision and control lies\n\twith the contractor.  The principal employer only controls and\n\tdirects the work to be done by a contract labour, when such labuor\n\tis assigned/alloted/sent to him.  But it is the contractor as\n\temployer who chooses whether the worker is to be assigned/alloted to\n\tthe principal employer or used otherwise.  In short, worker being\n\tthe employee of the contractor, the ultimate supervision and control\n\tlies with the contractor as he decides where the employee will work\n\tand how long he will work and subject to what conditions.  Only when\n\tthe contractor assigns/sends the worker to work under the principal\n\temployer, the worker works under the supervision and control of the\n\tprincipal employer but that is secondary control.  The primary\n\tcontrol is with the contractor. \n</blockquote>\n \n\n\n \n\n\n \n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"277653\" id=\"span_47\">In\n\tview of observations made by Apex Court as <a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_124\">referred above</a>, according\n\tto my opinion, there is no substance at all in present petition. \n\tThe Industrial Tribunal, Baroda has not committed any error and no\n\tsuch error are pointed by learned advocate  Mr. Mehta on behalf of\n\tpetitioner which required interference and which exercised power\n\tunder <a href=\"/doc/1331149/\" id=\"a_125\">Art. 227</a> of Constitution of India.  Accordingly, present\n\tpetition is dismissed.</span>  \n</p>\t\n\t  \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">Let\n\tpetitioner Corporation may consider  observation which is already\n\tmade by this Court in body of present order.  It is necessary to\n\tissue certain direction for doing substantial justice to respondent\n\tworkmen.  The service of workmen were terminated on 5/10/1999 and an\n\tindustrial dispute was raised by Union which referred for\n\tadjudication on 20/3/2002 being ITC no. 17/2002. The award passed by\n\tIndustrial Tribunal, Baroda on 22/10/2003 granted reinstatement with\n\tfull back wages as direct employees of petitioner and also directed\n\tto pay all benefits as permanent employee of petitioner.  They\n\tshould have to consider permanent from date on which they were join\n\tin service.  Thereafter, petition was filed by petitioner being SCA\n\tno. 2193/2004 and order was passed by this Court on 23/2/2002. The\n\treview application was preferred by petitioner in the year 2009\n\tbeing no. 2/2009 exh 9 decided on 15/2/2010.  this award is not\n\timplemented so far by petitioner as admitted by learned advocate Mr.\n\tMehta before this Court.  Even after such long gap of more than 10\n\tyears from date of termination  and seven years from date of award,\n\tworkmen are not able to get fruit of such award.  Therefore, it is\n\tdirected to petitioner to implement and to execute award passed by\n\tIndustrial Tribunal, Baroda in reference no. 17/2002 dated\n\t22/10/2003 within a period of  two months from date of receiving\n\tcopy of present order.\n</p>\n \n\n \n\n\n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_75\">\t\t\t\t\t\t\t\t(H.K.RATHOD,\nJ)\n \n\nasma\n\n    \n\n \n\t   \n      \n      \n\t    \n\t\t      \n\t   \n      \n\t  \t    \n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">\t\t   Top</span>\n\t   \n      \n\n\n</p>","numcites":63,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Gujarat High Court","citetid":104781,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"full back wages ","formInput":"full%20back%20wages%20"},{"value":"sham contract","formInput":"sham%20contract"},{"value":"Review own order  by industrial tribunal","formInput":"Review%20own%20order%20%20by%20industrial%20tribunal"},{"value":"review procedural","formInput":"review%20procedural"},{"value":"quasi judicial authority","formInput":"quasi%20judicial%20authority"},{"value":"review its own order tribunal","formInput":"review%20its%20own%20order%20tribunal"},{"value":"human dignity","formInput":"human%20dignity"},{"value":"power of review and tribunal","formInput":"power%20of%20review%20and%20tribunal"},{"value":"sham and nominal","formInput":"sham%20and%20nominal"},{"value":"contract labour","formInput":"contract%20labour"},{"value":"principal employer ","formInput":"principal%20employer%20"},{"value":"economic justice","formInput":"economic%20justice"},{"value":"article 38","formInput":"article%2038"},{"value":"directive principles","formInput":"directive%20principles"},{"value":"article 227","formInput":"article%20227"},{"value":"review by same court","formInput":"review%20by%20same%20court"},{"value":"article 12","formInput":"article%2012"},{"value":"'continuous service'","formInput":"%27continuous%20service%27"},{"value":"reinstatement ","formInput":"reinstatement%20"},{"value":"power of review, ","formInput":"power%20of%20review%2C%20"}],"cats":[{"value":"court-superintendence","formInput":"tag:court-superintendence"},{"value":"industrial","formInput":"tag:industrial"},{"value":"dispute-resolution-references","formInput":"tag:dispute-resolution-references"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
