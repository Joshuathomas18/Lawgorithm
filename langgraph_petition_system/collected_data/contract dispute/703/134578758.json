The Supreme Court\n\n     interpreting the language of <a href=\"/doc/738672/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 2(2)</a> of the\n\n     Act in para 21 held as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">             &quot;21. Now let us look at sub-sections (2), (3),\n             (4) and (5) of <a href=\"/doc/738672/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 2</a>. Sub-section (2) of\n             Section (2) provides that Part I would apply\n             where the place of arbitration is in India. To\n             be immediately noted that it is not providing\n             that Part I shall not apply where the place of\n             arbitration is not in India. It is also not\n             providing that Part I will &quot;only&quot; apply where\n             the place of arbitration is in India (emphasis\n             supplied). Thus the Legislature has not\n             provided that Part I is not to apply to\n             arbitrations which take place outside India.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">             The use of the language is significant and\n             important. The Legislature is emphasising\n             that the provisions of Part I would apply to\n             arbitrations which take place in India, but\n             not providing that the provisions of Part I\n             will not apply to arbitrations which take\n             place out of India. The wording of sub-\n             section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/738672/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 2</a> suggests that the\n             intention of the Legislature was to make\n             provisions of Part I compulsorily applicable\n             to an arbitration, including an international\n             commercial arbitration, which takes place in\n             India. Parties cannot, by agreement,\n             override or exclude the non-derogable\n             provisions of Part I in such arbitrations. By\n             omitting to provide that Part I will not apply\n             to international commercial arbitrations\n             which take place outside India the affect\n             would be that Part I would also apply to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                           Page 17 of 53</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">                                                    Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:57:41 IST 2023</span>\n C/SCA/285/2010                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n\n\n\n             international commercial arbitrations held\n             out of India. But by not specifically\n             providing that the provisions of Part I apply\n             to international commercial arbitrations\n             held out of India, the intention of the\n             Legislature appears to be to ally parties to\n             provide by agreement that Part I or any\n             provision therein will not apply. Thus in\n             respect of arbitrations which take place\n             outside India even the non-derogable\n             provisions of Part I can be excluded. Such\n             an agreement may be express or implied.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">     In para 32 of the decision concluded that the\n\n     provisions       of    Part-I       would      apply           to        all\n\n     arbitrations and it will be open to the parties to\n\n     exclude all or any of the provisions of Part-I by\n\n     virtue      of   an   agreement.          Para        32       of      the\n\n     judgement reads as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">             &quot;32. To conclude we hold that the provisions\n             of Part I would apply to all arbitrations and\n             to all proceedings relating thereto. Where\n             such arbitration is held in India the\n             provisions of Part I would compulsory apply\n             and parties are free to deviate only to the\n             extent    permitted     by    the    derogable\n             provisions of Part I. In cases of international\n             commercial arbitrations held out of India\n             provisions of Part I would apply unless the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">                             Page 18 of 53</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                                     Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:57:41 IST 2023</span>\n C/SCA/285/2010                                      CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n\n\n\n             parties by agreement, express or implied,\n             exclude all or any of its provisions.

Upon consideration of the entire\n             matter, it was observed that - &quot;In these\n             circumstances it is clear to me that the law\n             with which the agreement to arbitrate has\n             its closest and most real connection is the\n             law of the seat of arbitration, namely, the\n             law of England&quot;. (Para 14). It was thereafter\n             concluded by the High Court that English\n             Law is the proper law of the agreement to\n             arbitrate.

The legal position that emerges from a\n             conspectus of all the decisions, seems to be,\n             that the choice of another country as the\n             seat of arbitration inevitably imports an\n             acceptance that the law of that country\n             relating to the conduct and supervision of\n             arbitrations will apply to the proceedings.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">             117.

It would only mean that the\n             parties have contractually imported from\n             the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_47\">Arbitration Act, 1996</a>, those provisions\n             which are concerned with the internal\n             conduct of their arbitration and which are\n             not inconsistent with the mandatory\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                           Page 21 of 53</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                                   Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:57:41 IST 2023</span>\n C/SCA/285/2010                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n\n\n\n             provisions of the English Procedural\n             Law/Curial Law.

According to the learned counsel, Clause\n             28, which is the Arbitration Clause in the\n             Contract, clearly stipulates that any dispute\n             under the Contract &quot;is to be settled and\n             referred to Arbitration in London&quot;. It further\n             stipulates that English Law to apply. The\n             parties have thus clearly intended that the\n             Arbitration will be conducted in accordance\n             with English Law and the seat of the\n             Arbitration will be at London.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">             27. The question is whether the above\n             stipulations show the intention of the\n             parties to expressly or impliedly exclude the\n             provisions of Part I to the Arbitration, which\n             was to be held outside India, i.e., in London.\n             We think that the clause evinces such an\n             intention by providing that the English Law\n             will apply to the Arbitration. The clause\n             expressly provides that Indian Law or any\n             other law will not apply by positing that\n             English Law will apply. The intention is that\n             English Law will apply to the resolution of\n             any dispute arising under the law. This\n             means that English Law will apply to the\n             conduct of the Arbitration. It must also\n             follow that any objection to the conduct of\n             the Arbitration or the Award will also be\n             governed by English Law. Clearly, this\n             implies that the challenge to the Award\n             must be in accordance with English Law.\n             There is thus an express exclusion of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                           Page 24 of 53</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">                                                   Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:57:41 IST 2023</span>\n C/SCA/285/2010                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n\n\n\n             applicability of Part I to the instant\n             Arbitration by Clause 28. In fact, Clause 28\n             deals with not only the seat of Arbitration\n             but also provides that there shall be two\n             Arbitrators, one appointed by the charterers\n             and one by the owners and they shall\n             appoint an Umpire, in case there is no\n             agreement. In this context, it may be noted\n             that the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_55\">Indian Arbitration and Conciliation\n             Act, 1996</a> makes no provision for Umpires\n             and the intention is clearly to refer to an\n             Umpire contemplated by Section 21 of the\n             English Arbitration Act, 1996. It is thus\n             clear that the intention is that the\n             Arbitration should be conducted under the\n             English law, i.e. the English Arbitration Act,\n             1996. It may also be noted that <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_56\">Sections 67</a>,\n             <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_57\">68</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_58\">69</a> of the English Arbitration Act\n             provide for challenge to an Award on\n             grounds stated therein. The intention is thus\n             clearly to exclude the applicability of Part I\n             to the instant Arbitration proceedings.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">             28. This is a case where two factors exclude\n             the operation of <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_59\">Part I of the Arbitration Act</a>.\n             Firstly, the seat of Arbitration which is in\n             London and secondly the clause that English\n             Law will apply. In fact, such a situation has\n             been held to exclude the applicability of\n             Part I in a case where a similar clause\n             governed the Arbitration. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"156247141\" id=\"span_72\">In <a href=\"/doc/156247141/\" id=\"a_60\">Reliance\n             Industries Limited and another v.

I shall deal with Mr Hirst&#x27;s arguments in\n             due course but, in my judgment, they fail to\n             grapple with the central point at issue\n             which is whether or not, by choosing\n             London as the seat of the arbitration, the\n             parties must be taken to have agreed that\n             proceedings on the award should be only\n             those permitted by English law. In my view\n             they must be taken to have so agreed for the\n             reasons given by the Judge. The whole\n             purpose of the balance achieved by the\n             Bermuda form (English arbitration but\n             applying New York law to issues arising\n             under the policy) is that judicial remedies in\n             respect of the award should be those\n             permitted by English law and only those so\n             permitted. Mr Hirst could not say (and did\n             not say) that English judicial remedies for\n             lack    of    jurisdiction   on     procedural\n             irregularities under Sections 67 and 68 of\n             the 1996 Act were not permitted; he was\n             reduced to saying that New York judicial\n             remedies were also permitted. That,\n             however, would be a recipe for litigation\n             and (what is worse) confusion which cannot\n             have been intended by the parties. No doubt\n             New York law has its own judicial remedies\n             for want of jurisdiction and serious\n             irregularity but it could scarcely be\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                           Page 26 of 53</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                                   Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:57:41 IST 2023</span>\n C/SCA/285/2010                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n\n\n\n             supposed that a party aggrieved by one part\n             of an award could proceed in one\n             jurisdiction and a party aggrieved by\n             another part of an award could proceed in\n             another jurisdiction. Similarly, in the case of\n             a single complaint about an award, it could\n             not be supposed that the aggrieved party\n             could complain in one jurisdiction and the\n             satisfied party be entitled to ask the other\n             jurisdiction to declare its satisfaction with\n             the award. There would be a serious risk of\n             parties rushing to get the first judgment or\n             of conflicting decisions which the parties\n             cannot have contemplated.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">             <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1144681\" id=\"span_79\">56.

In laying down the\n             same proposition, the High Court noticed\n             that the issue in that case depended upon\n             the weight to be given to the provision in\n             Condition 12 of the insurance policy that\n             &quot;the seat of the arbitration shall be London,\n             England&quot;. It was observed that this\n             necessarily carried with it the English\n             Court&#x27;s supervisory jurisdiction over the\n             arbitration process.

It\n             is for this reason that recent authorities\n             have laid stress upon the locations of the\n             seat of the arbitration as an important\n             factor in determining the proper law of the\n             arbitration agreement.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_37\">             57. In our opinion, these observations in\n             Sulamerica case are fully applicable to the\n             facts and circumstances of this case. The\n             conclusion reached by the High Court would\n             lead to the chaotic situation where the\n             parties would be left rushing between India\n             and England for redressal of their\n             grievances.

In cases of international commercial\n             arbitrations held out of India provisions of\n             Part I would apply unless the parties by\n             agreement, express or implied, exclude all\n             or any of its provisions.

We are thus of the view that by Clause\n             28, the parties chose to exclude the\n             application of Part I to the Arbitration\n             proceedings between them by choosing\n             London as the venue for Arbitration and by\n             making     English     law    applicable    to\n             Arbitration, as observed earlier. It is too\n             well settled by now that where the parties\n             choose a juridical seat of Arbitration outside\n             India and provide that the law which\n             governs Arbitration will be a law other than\n             Indian law, part I of the Act would not have\n             any application and, therefore, the award\n             debtor would not be entitled to challenge\n             the award by raising objections under\n             <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 34</a> before a Court in India. A Court\n             in India could not have jurisdiction to\n             entertain such objections under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 34</a>\n             in such a case.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">             33. As a matter of fact the mere choosing of\n             the juridical seat of Arbitration attracts the\n             law applicable to such location. In other\n             words it would not be necessary to specify\n             which law would apply to the Arbitration\n             proceedings, since the law of the particular\n             country would apply ipso jure. The following\n             passage from Redfern and Hunter on\n             International    Arbitration   contains      the\n             following explication of the issue:- &quot;It is also\n             sometimes said that parties have selected\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">                            Page 31 of 53</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                                    Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:57:41 IST 2023</span>\n C/SCA/285/2010                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n\n\n\n             the procedural law that will govern their\n             arbitration, by providing for arbitration in a\n             particular country. This is too elliptical and,\n             as an English court itself held more recently\n             in Breas of Doune Wind Farm it does not\n             always hold true. What the parties have\n             done is to choose a place of arbitration in a\n             particular country. That choice brings with\n             it submission to the laws of that country,\n             including any mandatory provisions of its\n             law on arbitration. To say that the parties\n             have &#x27;chosen&#x27; that particular law to govern\n             the arbitration is rather like saying that an\n             English woman who takes her car to France\n             has &#x27;chosen&#x27; French traffic law, which will\n             oblige her to drive on the right-hand side of\n             the road, to give priority to vehicles\n             approaching from the right, and generally to\n             obey traffic laws to which she may not be\n             accustomed. But it would be an odd use of\n             language to say this notional motorist had\n             opted for &#x27;French traffic law&#x27;. What she has\n             done is to choose to go to France. The\n             applicability of French law then follows\n             automatically. It is not a matter of choice.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">             Parties may well choose a particular place\n             of arbitration precisely because its lex\n             arbitri is one which they find attractive.\n             Nevertheless, once a place of arbitration\n             has been chosen, it brings with it its own\n             law. If that law contains provisions that are\n             mandatory so far as arbitration are\n             concerned, those provisions must be\n             obeyed. It is not a matter of choice any more\n             than the notional motorist is free to choose\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                           Page 32 of 53</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">                                                   Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:57:41 IST 2023</span>\n C/SCA/285/2010                              CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n\n\n\n             which local traffic laws to obey and which to\n             disregard.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">             34.

Keeping the aforesaid in view, it is\n             necessary to keenly understand the decision\n             in Bhatia International (supra).

The parties\n             had agreed that the arbitration was to be\n             held in Paris, France. The first respondent\n             filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_93\">Section 9</a> of the\n             Act before the learned Additional District\n             Judge, Indore, M.P. with an interim prayer.\n             A plea was raised by the appellant that the\n             Indore Court had no jurisdiction and\n             application was not maintainable. The said\n             stand was repelled by the learned Additional\n             District Judge, which found favour with the\n             High Court. Before this Court, it was urged\n             on behalf of the appellant that <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_94\">Part I of the\n             Act</a> only applies to arbitration where the\n             place of arbitration is in India, but if the\n             place of arbitration is not in India, then <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_95\">Part\n             II of the Act</a> would apply. On behalf of the\n             respondent therein, it was urged that unless\n             the parties, by their agreement either\n             expressly or impliedly exclude its provisions,\n             Part I would also apply to all international\n             commercial arbitrations including those that\n             take place in India. The three-Judge Bench\n             came to hold thus:-\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">                 &quot;To conclude, we hold that the provisions\n                 of Part I would apply to all arbitrations\n                 and to all proceedings relating thereto.\n                 Where such arbitration is held in India\n                 the   provisions    of   Part   I  would\n                 compulsorily apply and parties are free\n                 to deviate only to the extent permitted\n                 by the derogable provisions of Part I. In\n                 cases    of   international   commercial\n                 arbitrations held out of India provisions\n                 of Part I would apply unless the parties\n                 by agreement, express or implied,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                           Page 37 of 53</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_115\">                                                   Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:57:41 IST 2023</span>\n C/SCA/285/2010                            CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n\n\n\n                 exclude all or any of its provisions. In\n                 that case the laws or rules chosen by the\n                 parties would prevail.

Based on the aforesaid\n                 amendment, the Arbitral Tribunal has\n                 rendered the final partial consent award\n                 of 14-9-2011 recording that the juridical\n                 seat (or legal place) of the arbitration for\n                 the purposes of arbitration initiated\n                 under the claimants&#x27; notice of arbitration\n                 dated 16-12-2010 shall be London,\n                 England. Furthermore, the judgment in\n                 Videocon Industries is subsequent to\n                 Venture Global.

First, we shall advert to the first\n             proposition. There is no cavil over the\n             principle stated in Bhatia International\n             (supra) that <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_108\">Part I of the Act</a> is applicable to\n             arbitrations held outside India unless the\n             parties have either expressly or impliedly\n             excluded the provisions of the Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"997135\" id=\"span_125\">Mr.\n             Vishwanathan, learned senior counsel has\n             submitted in the case at hand there is no\n             express exclusion, for clause remotely does\n             not suggest so. For the said purpose, he has\n             commended us to the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/997135/\" id=\"a_109\">A.B.C.\n             Laminart Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v. A.P.

He\n             would submit that to apply the principle of\n             implied exclusion, the Court has to test the\n             &quot;presumed intention&quot; and in such a\n             situation, it is the duty of the Court to adopt\n             an objective approach, that is to say, what\n             would have been the intention of reasonable\n             parties in the position of the actual parties\n             to the contract. Learned senior counsel\n             would also contend that the concept of fair\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                           Page 41 of 53</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_127\">                                                   Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:57:41 IST 2023</span>\n C/SCA/285/2010                              CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n\n\n\n             result has to be kept in view while\n             construing a contract.

As a\n                 corollary to the above conclusion, we\n                 hold that the Delhi High Court did not\n                 have the jurisdiction to entertain the\n                 petition filed by the respondents under\n                 <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_117\">Section 9</a> of the Act and the mere fact\n                 that the appellant had earlier filed\n                 similar petitions was not sufficient to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">                           Page 43 of 53</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">                                                   Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:57:41 IST 2023</span>\n C/SCA/285/2010                               CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n\n\n\n                   clothe that High Court with the\n                   jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed\n                   by the respondents.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">             ...\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">             ...\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">             48. In the present case, the agreement\n             stipulates that the contract is to be\n             governed and construed according to the\n             English law. This occurs in the arbitration\n             clause. Mr. Vishwanathan, learned senior\n             counsel, would submit that this part has to\n             be interpreted as a part of &quot;curial law&quot; and\n             not as a &quot;proper law&quot; or &quot;substantive law&quot;. It\n             is his submission that it cannot be equated\n             with the seat of arbitration. As we perceive,\n             it forms as a part of the arbitration clause.\n             There is ample indication through various\n             phrases like &quot;arbitration in London to\n             apply&quot;, arbitrators are to be the members of\n             the &quot;London Arbitration Association&quot; and\n             the contract &quot;to be governed and construed\n             according to English Law&quot;. It is worth\n             noting that there is no other stipulation\n             relating to the applicability of any law to the\n             agreement. There is no other clause\n             anywhere in the contract. That apart, it is\n             also postulated that if the dispute is for an\n             amount less that US $ 50000 then, the\n             arbitration    should    be    conducted     in\n             accordance with small claims procedure of\n             the     London       Maritime       Arbitration\n             Association. When the aforesaid stipulations\n             are read and appreciated in the contextual\n             perspective, &quot;the presumed intention&quot; of the\n             parties is clear as crystal that the juridical\n             seat of arbitration would be London.

Therefore, when enforcement of\n\n     the foreign award is sought, it is open for the\n\n     respondent      to    plead       the    same         ground             as\n\n     available under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_132\">Section 34</a>.

Thus,       as and      when\n             enforcement of the award is sought against\n             the petitioner, it can resist the enforcement\n             of the award on the same grounds on which\n             it could have challenged the award under\n             <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 34</a> of the Act. Therefore, it cannot\n             be said that the petitioner has no remedy of\n             challenging the Award. It is a settled\n             principle of law that in construing statutes\n             one has to adhere to the ordinary meaning\n             of the words used and to the grammatical\n             construction unless that is at variance with\n             the intention of the legislature to be\n             collected from the scheme of the statute\n             itself or leads to any manifest absurdity or\n             repugnancy. It appears from the reading of\n             the Act that insofar as the challenge and\n             enforceability is concerned, there are\n             different schemes for a domestic award and\n             a foreign award. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_135\">The Act</a> provides for a\n             direct challenge to a domestic award\n             (<a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_136\">section 34</a>).      A   domestic    award    is\n             enforceable     as   a    decree passed by a\n             Civil Court, after the period provided for\n             challenging the same is over, and in case it\n             is challenged, after the challenge fails\n             (<a href=\"/doc/1286256/\" id=\"a_137\">section 36</a>). Whereas, insofar as a foreign\n             award is concerned, it is not enforceable in\n             India unless the court finds that it is\n             enforceable. For that purpose, the party\n             which seeks its enforcement has to make an\n             application to the Court, and has to satisfy\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_152\">                           Page 50 of 53</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_153\">                                                   Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:57:41 IST 2023</span>\n C/SCA/285/2010                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n\n\n\n             the Court about its enforceability (section\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">             49). It is only after the party satisfies the\n             Court that a foreign award becomes\n             enforceable as a decree passed by a Civil\n             Court (<a href=\"/doc/1283214/\" id=\"a_138\">section      49</a>). <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_139\">The Act</a>, provides\n             different remedies to persons, against\n             whom domestic award is made and person\n             against whom foreign award is made. A\n             person against whom a domestic award is\n             made, has to immediately approach the\n             Court for challenging the same by making\n             an application under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_140\">Section 34</a> of the Act\n             otherwise the person in whose favour the\n             award has been made can execute the same\n             as a decree. On the other hand, a person\n             against whom a foreign award has been\n             made, is not required to challenge the same,\n             because it cannot be executed against him\n             in India unless the Court finds that it is\n             enforceable. He can wait till the person in\n             whose favour the foreign award has been\n             made, makes an application before the\n             Court (<a href=\"/doc/1886363/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 47</a>). Rule 803E of Rules\n             framed by this Court, provides for a notice\n             to be issued to the person who is likely to be\n             adversely affected by the proceeding. After\n             receiving the notice from the Court, he can\n             appear before the Court, and submit his\n             defence and resist the enforcement of the\n             foreign award against him. He can request\n             the Court not to enforce the award and in\n             case he succeeds in satisfying the Court on\n             one or more of the grounds mentioned in\n             <a href=\"/doc/444899/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 48</a> of the Act, the Court has to\n             refuse to enforce the award. As observed\n             above, comparison of the provision of\n             <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 34</a> and <a href=\"/doc/444899/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 48</a> of the Act shows\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_154\">                           Page 51 of 53</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_155\">                                                   Downloaded on : Fri Jan 13 20:57:41 IST 2023</span>\n C/SCA/285/2010                             CAV JUDGMENT DATED: 13/01/2023\n\n\n\n\n             that a person against whom a foreign\n             award has been made can resist the\n             enforcement of the foreign award against\n             him on the same ground on which he could\n             have, had it been provided, challenged the\n             validity of the award under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_145\">Section 34</a> of the\n             Act. In other words, the grounds on which a\n             domestic award can be challenged and the\n             grounds on which the enforcement of a\n             foreign award can be resisted are identical.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">             Thus, though the Scheme of the Act\n             provides different kind of remedies to the\n             persons aggrieved by a domestic award and\n             a person aggrieved by a foreign award, both\n             the remedies are equally efficacious and\n             adequate, it cannot be said that the Act does\n             not provide an effective remedy to a person\n             who is aggrieved by a foreign award.
