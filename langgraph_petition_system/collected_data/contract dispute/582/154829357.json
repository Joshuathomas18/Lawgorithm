M. JOSEPH, J.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">       &#x27;E-auction&#x27; for sale of scrapped ammonia/urea plants of\n\nthe appellant company (hereinafter referred as &#x27;FACT&#x27;) at\n\nCochin Division was conducted by M/s. MSTC. Production has\n\nbeen stopped in the year 2003. First respondent (petitioner in\n\nW.P.(C) No.9049/2012) was the highest bidder in the auction.\n\nIt offered Rs.33,50,00,001/-. By Ext.P6 letter it was asked to\n\ndeposit 10% of the bid amount, less the EMD, which was\n\ncomplied with. On 10/1/2011          M/s.MSTC issued Ext.P7\n\nconfirming the sale and asked the first respondent to deposit\n\nthe balance by way of Demand Draft. As per the condition of\n\nthe sale, the first respondent has to furnish a performance\n\nbond/bank guarantee for Rs.170 lakhs within 15 days of\n\nacceptance of the sale. Bank guarantee was furnished and\n\nexecuted on 27/1/2011.        FACT however, by Ext.P8 dated\n\n28/1/2011 intimated the first respondent that further\n\nproceedings in the sale order were stayed until further advice.\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others         2</span>\n\nThe first respondent approached this Court by filing W.P.(C)\n\nNo.5541/2011 challenging Exts.P8 and P10. Ext.P10 was the\n\nletter issued by FACT stating that further proceedings were put\n\non hold and as such the bank guarantee for performance bond\n\nhas not been processed further. By Ext.P1 judgment this Court\n\ndisposed of W.P.(C) No.5541/2011. Paragraph 27 of the said\n\njudgment reads as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">            &quot;27.    Hence, the writ petition is disposed of\n        directing the respondent company to take a final\n        decision on the question of proceeding with further\n        steps pursuant to the tender confirmed in favour of\n        the petitioner, through      decision of its Board of\n        Directors    or   through  decision   of   any  other\n        competent authority. Needless to say that if the\n        respondent proposes to cancel the bid finalised in\n        favour of the petitioner, they shall be afforded with\n        an opportunity of personal hearing and a reasoned\n        order is to be issued in that regard. It is left open\n        to   those     petitioners  in   various   impleading\n        applications filed before this court, other than the\n        petitioners      in    WP(C).No.11151/2011        and\n        22767/2011 to submit representations before the\n        respondent making their offers. The question to be\n        decided by the respondent is mainly on the issue as\n        to whether there exist any valid reasons for\n        cancellation of the bid which is confirmed in favour\n        of the petitioner, which is to be decided on the\n        basis of facts and circumstances prevailing and on\n        the basis of observations contained herein above,\n        taking note of all contentions raised by the\n        petitioner.    I am of the view that any delay caused\n        in this regard will cause prejudice and loss to the\n        petitioner as well as to the respondent company.\n        Therefore it is necessary to have a final decision\n        taken on the matter at the earliest possible.\n</blockquote>\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       3</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       Considering status of the proceedings now pending\n       and also considering other exigencies, I direct the\n       respondent to take a final decision as directed\n       above, within 10 days from the date of receipt of a\n       copy of this judgment.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">      2.

It was further informed to you\n\n      vide e-mail dated 31.01.2011 that Bank Guarantee\n\n      for Performance Bond has not been processed\n\n      further.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">      While the matter of stay on sale order was under\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      the consideration by the company, you approached\n\n      the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Kerala vide Writ Petition\n\n      No.WP(C) No.5541/2011 praying for a &#x27;writ of\n\n      certiorari&#x27; and &#x27;writ of mandamus&#x27; against the\n\n      company which has ultimately been disposed off\n\n      vide judgment dated 23rd December 2011 directing\n\n      the company to take a final decision on the matter.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      As directed by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court, you were\n\n      given an opportunity to appear before the Board to\n\n      explain the position.

The offers made by other applicants; and,\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      5. Public interest.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">      The value of the old Ammonia-Urea plant of FACT\n\n       Cochin Division as assessed by Projects and\n\n       Development India Ltd., FEDO and Engineers India\n\n       Ltd. vary significantly. Hence the valuation does\n\n       not give a true picture on the value of the scrapped\n\n       plant.    The     Urea plants  of  Neyveli    Lignite\n\n       Corporation having one half of the capacity of FACT\n\n       Plant, fetched Rs.132 Crores. The parties who filed\n\n       the impleading petitions before the Hon&#x27;ble High\n\n       Court of Kerala in their representation submitted to\n\n       FACT, have offered higher amount. FACT is not in a\n\n       position to accept any offer from any party without\n\n       following transparent procedures. There is a need\n\n       to protect the overall public interest and the\n\n       interest of FACT, being a Government Company\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       5</span>\n\n       and the company is committed to avoid any\n\n       chances of loss of public money.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">      Under the above circumstances, the company has\n\n       decided to cancel the bid finalized in your favour.\n\n      You are, therefore, informed that the bid finalized\n\n       in your favour, which was kept on stay, has been\n\n       cancelled.

The first respondent filed a petition before the\n\nappellant to review the decision, which was rejected by the\n\nappellant through Ext.P4. The present writ petition is filed\n\nchallenging Ext.P2 and P4. As far as W.A.No.1291/2013, which\n\narises from the judgment in W.P.(C) No.14873/2012, is\n\nconcerned, the writ petition was filed by the second respondent\n\nin W.A.No.942/2013 who had not participated in the auction.\n\nThey had sought to be impleaded in the earlier writ petition\n\n(W.P.(C) No.5541/2011) making an offer of Rs.52.11 crores.\n\nW.A. No.1268/13 is filed by them against the judgment in W.P\n\n(C).9049/12.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">      4.

Learned senior counsel for FACT in W.A.No.942/2013\n\nwould submit that the learned Single Judge has clearly erred in\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       7</span>\n\ngranting the relief by directing the appellant company to act on\n\nthe basis of Ext.P7 sale confirmation. He would submit that the\n\nappellant company has taken a bona fide decision in the\n\ncommercial realm guided by relevant facts. He would point out\n\nthat the learned Single Judge has erred in finding that there is\n\npassing of property in the goods to the writ petitioner merely\n\non the basis of issuance of the sale letter. He would also point\n\nout that having regard to the provisions in the contract between\n\nthe FACT and bidders, as contained in the tender document, by\n\nissuance of sale confirmation letter property could not have\n\npassed. He would, in fact, submit that the learned Single Judge\n\nhas erred in proceeding on the basis that it is a case of mere\n\nsale of goods and deciding the matter by referring to the <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_2\">Sale\n\nof Goods Act</a>. He would contend that what is contemplated is\n\nremoval of the scrap from the premises and it is not a mere\n\nsale of goods. According to him, a perusal of the condition in\n\nExt.P5 would show that if there is a delivery order issued, it\n\ncould not be said that there is a transfer of property in the\n\ngoods. It is without noticing various relevant conditions and\n\nonly on the basis of reference to the <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_3\">Sale of Goods Act</a> that the\n\nlearned Single Judge arrived at an erroneous conclusion that\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others         8</span>\n\nthere is a concluded contract of sale/transfer of property. It is\n\non the said mistaken impression that the learned Single Judge,\n\nthereafter, finds that the decision of the FACT is arbitrary. The\n\nlearned counsel submits that this is a case where there was a\n\ncomplaint. The committee took a bona fide decision that the\n\nsale bid need not be accepted and it is to be cancelled, which is\n\nwithin the powers of the company.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">       7. Learned senior counsel for the FACT would submit\n\nthat the learned Single Judge erred in proceeding as if the case\n\nis one to be considered only with reference to the         <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_4\">Sale of\n\nGoods Act</a> 1930.          It is submitted that even if it is a case\n\ncovered by <a href=\"/doc/547058/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 64</a> of the Sale of Goods Act, the question as\n\nto whether the property in the goods would pass, has to be\n\ndecided further with reference to the terms of the contract. In\n\nthis connection, he would refer to the terms of the contract as\n\nfound in Ext.P5- special terms and conditions for auction. He\n\nwould submit that under clause (5) no doubt there is a sale\n\nconfirmation (Ext.P7) issued in favour of the writ petitioner.\n\nAccording to him, with that alone the property in the goods is\n\nnot transferred.       This is in view of clauses 6,7 and 11 in\n\nparticular. Under clause (6) the period of contract is shown as\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others        9</span>\n\nup to the validity of the Delivery Order/Release Order issued by\n\nthe auctioneers/appellant. Clause (7) provides for the payment\n\nterms. It inter alia provides that on receiving the EMD (10% of\n\nthe value), sale letter is to be issued. The balance payment of\n\n90% with taxes/duties on confirmation of the acceptance of the\n\nlot is to be     made within 30 days      of the issue of    sale\n\norder/acceptance letter. There is provision for credit facility.\n\nFurther under clause (7) it is also mentioned that in addition\n\nto the      aforesaid, the successful      bidder is to submit\n\nPerformance Bond within 15 days of the date         of the   sale\n\norder.   Clause 7 (f) provides     that on   compliance with the\n\naforesaid conditions, delivery order will be issued. Clause 11 is\n\nrelevant and crucial. We extract the same below:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">               &quot;11.) THE FERTILISERS AND CHEMICALS\n        TRVANCORE LIMITED/MSTC reserves the right\n        to accept/reject and cancel any bid, amend the\n        quantity under any lot or withdraw any lot at\n        any stage under this e-auction sale after\n        acceptance of bid/issue     of Sale Order/deposit\n        of full value by the buyer, without assigning\n        any reason thereof and the value of such\n        material if paid for, shall be refundable\n        FACT/MSTC shall not be responsible for any\n        damages/loss              whatsoever           to\n        purchasers/Bidders/Buyer on account of such\n        withdrawal, at any stage from the auction\n        sale.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">      8. We would refer to clause (13) and          the same is\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others         10</span>\n\nextracted below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">                       &quot;13) The goods after confirmation of\n         sale left at FACT will remain at the sole risk\n         and             responsibility      of        the\n         purchaser/bidder/buyer MSTC/FACT will not\n         undertake any liability whatsoever for the safe\n         custody, protection or preservation after the\n         sale has been confirmed.

With reference to clause (11), the contention is that it\n\ncontemplates the right to accept/reject and cancel any bid after\n\nthe acceptance of the bid/issue of sale Order/deposit of full\n\nvalue by the buyer. Still further at any rate he would submit\n\nthat the FACT has a right to amend the quantity under any lot\n\nor withdraw any lot at any stage         after the acceptance of\n\nbid/issue of sale order and even the deposit of full value by the\n\nbuyer.    No reason need be assigned in regard thereto.        He\n\nwould complain that the learned Single Judge has not at all\n\nadverted to the effect of clause (11) in particular. In short,\n\nhis contention is that this is a case where the property in goods\n\nhas not passed to the 1st respondent.        After the issuance of\n\nthe sale letter, though in this case EMD of 10% was given and\n\neven if the first respondent was ready to pay the balance\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others      11</span>\n\namount, in fact it was not paid.     What is more under clause\n\n(11) in view of the right reserved to FACT to cancel the bid\n\nand at any rate to amend the quantity or to withdraw any lot\n\neven after sale letter being issued/full payment clearly, the\n\nproperty in the goods must be treated as remaining with FACT.\n\nThe property in the goods would pass only on issuance of the\n\ndelivery order       because after the issuance of the delivery\n\norder,   power may not be available to cancel/reject a bid,\n\namend or withdraw any lot. Fundamental error is committed\n\nby the learned Single Judge , it is pointed out, in ignoring the\n\nimpact of clause (11).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">       10. The learned senior counsel for the first respondent,\n\non the other hand, would submit that there is no merit in the\n\nappeal. The amount involved in the bid is for more than Rs.33\n\ncrores. He would point out that there are three valuation\n\nreports. M/s. Projects and Development (India) Ltd. arrived at\n\nthe valuation of Rs.23.56 crores during November, 2009. M/s.\n\nFEDO, which was asked to review of the valuation made by the\n\nearlier valuer, conducted a detailed study and reported that the\n\nphysical assets are having value of Rs.28.6927 crores. This\n\nvaluation was done in August, 2010, before the &#x27;e-auction&#x27; was\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others      12</span>\n\nconducted. After Ext.P1 judgment the FACT took a decision to\n\nhave another valuation conducted by M/s. Engineers India Ltd.\n\nReport of M/s. Engineers India Ltd. made an estimation of the\n\nasset value as Rs.26.2212 crores. He would, therefore, point\n\nout that the price, which was offered by the first respondent as\n\nRs.33,50,00,0001/-, is more than the highest valuation\n\nobtained under the three reports by Rs.5 crores. He would also\n\nsubmit that this is not a case that there is any justification for\n\nthe appellant, which is an authority under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_6\">Article 12</a> of the\n\nConstitution, to not proceed with the sale letter. He would also\n\npoint out that, at any rate, having regard to Ext.P7, by which\n\nthe offer was accepted and confirmed, the property in the\n\ngoods passed to it. He further submit that however, clauses\n\nwhich are referred to by the appellant relate to the enforcement\n\nof the contractual obligation and will not detract from the\n\nproperty of the goods passing to the first respondent.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">            11. The contention of the 1st respondent is that upon\n\nthe writ petitioner becoming the highest bidder and what is\n\nmore bid being accepted and the sale letter being issued, EMD\n\nbeing paid, the writ petitioner being further ready to pay the\n\nbalance amount and to comply with the conditions otherwise,\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others         13</span>\n\nthe provisions in clause (11) cannot bear the interpretation\n\nsought to be placed on it by the appellant.      He would contend\n\nthat   working of clause (7) relates to the enforcement of the\n\ncontract which already stands concluded with the issuance of\n\nExt.P7 sale letter. Clause (8) also relates to enforcement of\n\nthe contract and cannot militate against the concluded sale.\n\nAs far as clause (11) itself, it is case of the 1st respondent that\n\nclause (11) must be understood as falling in two parts, at any\n\nrate. In so far as it relates to &#x27;accept/reject and cancel any bid&#x27;\n\nwhile it can be      done without assigning any reason thereof\n\nthough reason must exist, it cannot be done after the stage\n\nwhere the bid is accepted/sale order is issued/deposit of full\n\nvalue is made by the buyer. In other words, portion relating to\n\nthe reservation of right to accept/reject, cancel any bid is not\n\nqualified by the words acceptance of bid/issue of sale\n\norder/deposit of full value by the buyer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"29469216\" id=\"span_14\">12. <a href=\"/doc/29469216/\" id=\"a_7\">Shri Sunil V.

The sale in question has never been cancelled. The\n\nsale was put on hold based on some complaints. According to\n\nthe appellant company the Board was to take a final decision.\n\nNobody had challenged the sale by raising any allegation or\n\nfraud, collusion or any material illegality. The question to be\n\ndecided was whether the bid knocked in favour of the writ\n\npetitioner and the confirmation granted to him needs to be\n\ncancelled, merely because subsequent offers for higher price\n\nhas come up before the Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">      15. It is here that learned Single Judge took the view\n\nthat it is for the appellant company to decide at the first\n\ninstance considering the circumstances prevailing and also\n\nconsidering the legal principles. Learned Single Judge found\n\nthat according to the counsel for the appellant company, they\n\nare not in a position to take any risk by affording a re-tender,\n\nespecially in view of the fact that bid of the writ petitioner was\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others        15</span>\n\nfor more than .33 crores and is in the third round of E-\n\nauction . It     had furnished 10% deposit as well as Bank\n\nGuarantee/Performance Guarantee.          It was noted that the\n\nstand of the company was that it was interested in getting more\n\nmoney. Considering overall situations, the learned single Judge\n\ntook the view that it is for the respondent company to take final\n\ndecision on the matter. In regard to the applicant who sought\n\nimpleadment except writ petition Nos. 11151/2011 and\n\n22767/11 the impleading petitions were not allowed, but they\n\nwere given liberty to approach the company with their offers.\n\nThe company was asked to take final decision on the question\n\nof proceeding with further steps pursuant to the tender\n\nconfirmed in favour of the petitioner, through decision of its\n\nBoard of Directors.      It was further held if the respondent\n\npropose to cancel the bid finalised in favour of the writ\n\npetitioner, they should be given opportunity          of personal\n\nhearing and a reasoned order is to be passed. It is inter alia\n\ndirected to decide the question as to whether there exist any\n\nvalid reasons for     cancellation of the bid, which was confirmed\n\nin favour of the petitioner, taking note of all the facts and\n\ncircumstance prevailing and on the observations contained in\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others        16</span>\n\nthe judgment and taking note of all the contentions raised by\n\nthe petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">     16.

As informed, FACT&#x27;s scrapped\n          plant is having 192 reformer tubes, and the\n          value, therefore, would be higher than what\n          has been indicated in the valuation report.\n          Shri S.C.Gupta, Director, said that the reports\n          of outside Consultants have to be internally\n          discussed      before  their  finalization  and\n          acceptance by the Company. He stated that\n          instead of Board evaluating the value of the\n          scrap on its own, it would be better that the\n          instances and valuation of similar scrap items\n          in case of RCF and NLC are also brought to the\n          notice of EIL.

The NLC scrap\n          sale clearly indicates that the ammonia urea\n          plant has the potential to fetch a much higher\n          price on re-tendering.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">          After deliberation, the Board considered the\n          following:\n</p>\f\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others        21</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">          1.

It is something\n        which invites and is communicated to notify\n        acceptance.        Broadly stated it must be\n        unconditional; must be in the proper form, the\n        person by whom tender is made must be able\n        to and willing to perform his obligations. The\n        terms of the invitation to tender cannot be\n        open to judicial scrutiny because the invitation\n        to tender is in the realm of contract. However,\n        a limited      judicial review may be available in\n        cases where it is established that the terms of\n        the invitation to tender were so tailor-made to\n        suit the convenience of any particular person\n        with a view to eliminate all others from\n        participating in the biding process.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">        27. The bidders participating in the tender\n        process have no other right except the right to\n        equality and fair treatment in the matter of\n        evaluation of competitive bids offered by\n        interested persons in response to notice inviting\n        tenders in a transparent manner and free from\n        hidden agenda.         One cannot challenge the\n        terms and conditions of the tender except on\n        the above stated ground, the reason being the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       24</span>\n\n        terms of the invitation to tender are in the\n        realm of the contract. No bidder is entitled as a\n        matter of right to insist the authority inviting\n        tenders to enter into further negotiations unless\n        the terms and conditions of notice so provided\n        for such negotiations.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">        28. It is so well settled in law and needs no\n        restatement at our hands that disposal of the\n        public    property  by     the   State   or   its\n        instrumentalities partakes the character of a\n        trust.

Kisan Sahkari Chini Mills Ltd. Vardan Linkers (2008)\n\n12 SCC 500) . There were six State controlled sugar mills in\n\nUttaranchal State which produced molasses.      Sale of molasses\n\nby   them was controlled by the Molasses Sale Committee\n\nconstituted by the State Government.      On the basis of tender\n\nreceived the Committee permitted the respondent in           the\n\nappeal to lift 85,000 quintals of molasses from the mills at a\n\nparticular price.    The Government received a report that the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others        25</span>\n\nprice was much higher. The Secretary, Cane Development and\n\nSugar Industries stayed the order of the Committee. In the\n\namended writ petition filed by the respondents, the High Court\n\ntook the view that there was a concluded contract and that\n\nhaving regard to the doctrines of part-performance, legitimate\n\nexpectation, estoppel and acquiescence, cancellation of the\n\nallotment letter was unsustainable.       Probably this is a case\n\nwhich is closest to the facts of the instant case and in fact relied\n\non by the learned Single Judge also.            We may refer to\n\nparagraphs 23 and 24, which are quoted herein as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">           &quot;23.    If the dispute was considered as purely\n     one relating to existence of an agreement, that is,\n     whether there was a concluded contract and\n     whether the cancellation and consequential non-\n     supply amounted to breach of such contract, the\n     first respondent ought to have approached the civil\n     court for damages. On the other hand, when a writ\n     petition was filed in regard to the said contractual\n     dispute, the issue was whether the Secretary\n     (Sugar) had acted arbitrarily or unreasonably in\n     staying the operation of the allotment letter dated\n     26/3/2004 or subsequently cancelling the allotment\n     letter.      In a civil suit, the emphasis is on the\n     contractual right. In a writ petition, the focus shifts\n     to the exercise of power by the authority, that is,\n     whether the order of cancellation dated 24/4/2004\n     passed by the Secretary(Sugar), was arbitrary or\n     unreasonable.       The issue whether there was a\n     concluded contract and breach thereof becomes\n     secondary. In       exercising writ jurisdiction, if the\n     High Court found that the exercise of power in\n     passing an order of cancellation was not arbitrary\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others        26</span>\n\n    and unreasonable, it should normally desist from\n    giving any        finding on disputed or complicated\n    questions of fact as to whether there was a\n    contract, and relegate the petitioner to the remedy\n    of a civil suit. Even in cases where the High Court\n    finds that there is a valid contract, if the impugned\n    administrative action by which        the contract is\n    cancelled, is not unreasonable or arbitrary, it should\n    still refuse to interfere with the same, leaving the\n    aggrieved party to work out his remedies in a civil\n    court. In other words, when there is a contractual\n    dispute with a public law element and a party\n    choose the public law remedy by way of a writ\n    petition instead of a private law remedy of a suit,\n    he will not get a full-fledged adjudication of his\n    contractual rights, but only a judicial review of the\n    administrative       action.   The  question whether\n    there was a        contract and whether   there was a\n    breach, may however be examined incidentally\n    while considering the reasonableness of           the\n    administrative action. But where the question\n    whether there was a contract is seriously disputed\n    the High Court cannot assume that there was a\n    valid contract and on that basis, examine the\n    validity of the administrative action.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">           24. In this case, the question that arose for a\n    consideration in the writ petition was whether the\n    order dated 24/4/2004 passed by the Secretary\n    (Sugar), cancelling the allotment letter dated\n    26/3/2004 was arbitrary and irrational or violative\n    of any administrative law principles. The question\n    whether there        was a concluded contract or not,\n    was only incidental to the question as to whether\n    cancellation      order   dated  24/4/2004    by  the\n    Secretary (Sugar) was justified.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">     (5).

It cannot be denied that the principles of\n       judicial review would apply to the exercise of\n       contractual powers by Government bodies in order\n       to prevent arbitrariness or favouritism. However,\n       it must be clearly stated that there are inherent\n       limitations in exercise of that power of judicial\n       review. Government is the guardian of the\n       finances of the State. It is expected to protect the\n       financial interest of the State. The right to refuse\n       the lowest or any other tender is always available\n       to the Government. But, the principles <a href=\"/doc/410137/\" id=\"a_11\">laid down\n       in</a> <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution have to be kept in\n       view while accepting or refusing a tender. There\n       can be no question of infringement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 14</a> if\n       the government tries to get the best person or the\n       best quotation. The right to choose cannot be\n       considered to be an arbitrary power. Of course, if\n       the said power is exercised for any collateral\n       purpose the exercise of that power will be struck\n       down.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">              74.

The learned senior counsel for FACT would point\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others        34</span>\n\nout that the learned Single Judge ought to have found that in\n\nthis case the appellant has seriously disputed the contract and\n\ntherefore in terms of the judgment of the Apex Court the\n\nlearned Single Judge ought not have assumed that there is a\n\nvalid contract. On the other hand, the learned counsel for the\n\nwrit petitioner would contend that there is no fraud committed\n\nin the matter of holding the auction.           There   are    no\n\nirregularities attending the sale.    He would point out that a\n\nmistake as to fact hardly suffices to vitiate a contract. He\n\nrelied on <a href=\"/doc/1903729/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 25</a> of the Contract Act to point out that mere\n\ninadequacy of consideration cannot vitiate the contract.      The\n\nlearned counsel would submit that there is an unconditional\n\ncontract of sale of specific goods in a deliverable state and\n\nthere is nothing which militates against the passing of title with\n\nthe sale being confirmed.       Vide Ext.P7, the property of the\n\ngoods passed. FACT could not divest the writ petitioner of its\n\ntitle to the goods.      The decision not to proceed with the sale\n\nwas clearly illegal. The State could not proceed to re- auction\n\nthe property of another in view of the fact that the title had\n\npassed to the writ petitioner.      The State could not act in an\n\narbitrary manner.       He also drew support from clause (13) of\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       35</span>\n\nExt.P5 and contended that it clearly shows that the property\n\nhad been passed by virtue of the confirmation of the sale as it\n\nis is stated therein that after   confirmation of the sale, the\n\ngoods left    are at the risk of the buyer.   Therefore,   there\n\ncannot be any doubt that the property had passed to the\n\nsuccessful bidder.      He also would point out   clause (46) of\n\nExt.P5.\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">             &quot;46.

In this case there was an auction under Ext.P5 terms\n\nand conditions.      The 1st respondent apparently offered the\n\nhighest price of about more than 33 Crores. Thus, the first\n\nrespondent was the successful bidder.        We notice that the\n\nposition in respect of an auction sale has been considered by\n\nthe Apex Court in the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1542029/\" id=\"a_45\">Consolidated Coffee Ltd. And\n\nanother v. Coffee Board, Bangalore</a> (1980 (3) SCC 358).     It is\n\nheld that <a href=\"/doc/677566/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 64 (2)</a> of the Sale of Goods Act does not deal\n\nwith the question of passing of property at the auction and it\n\nonly deals with the completion of the contract of sale.    The\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       38</span>\n\nquestion as to passing of title must be decided with reference\n\nto the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_47\">Sale of Goods Act</a> and the intention of\n\nthe parties as evident from the terms of the contract and also\n\nany other attendant circumstances.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_79\">     22. Now, we must pass on to the question as to whether\n\nthe FACT was justified in proceeding to cancel the bid.         As\n\nalready noted the parties were before this court earlier and it\n\nculminated in Ext.P1 Judgment.        In Ext.P1 Judgment taking\n\nnote of the various facts, the Court had directed the appellant\n\nto take    a final decision in the matter as to whether there\n\nexisted any valid reason for cancellation of the bid which was\n\nconfirmed in favour of the 1st respondent taking note of the\n\ncircumstances and observations therein. The learned Single\n\nJudge has found that the impugned decision cannot be\n\nsustained and set aside the same and direct the        FACT     to\n\nproceed further on the basis of the sale confirmation in favour\n\nof the 1st respondent.     Let us examine the reasoning of the\n\nlearned Single Judge.     With regard to clause 11 of Ext.P5, it is\n\nfound that even though it empowers the FACT to cancel without\n\nassigning any reason there must exist reasons. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1261492\" id=\"span_57\">In this regard\n\nthe learned Single Judge relied on       the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_48\">Kumari\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others        39</span>\n\nShrilekha Vidyarathi And others v. State of U.P. and others</a>\n\n(1991 1 SCC 212). It is found that the appellant could not act\n\narbitrarily and not enter into relationship with any person. The\n\nlearned Single Judge proceeded to find that the observations in\n\nExt.P2 and Ext.R1(f) to the effect that value assessed by the\n\nthree agencies who were engaged by the FACT to value the\n\nmaterials in question         varied significantly and that the\n\nvaluation did not       give  a true   picture   was found to be\n\nunconvincing.       It was found that observations were made\n\nwithout any genuineness considering the facts revealed from\n\nthe valuation reports.     In regard to the sale of similar plant of\n\nthe   Neyveli Lignite Corporation at Rs. 32 Crores which was\n\nmatter referred for opinion of M/s FEDO, which had made the\n\nvaluation,    it had noted that the successful bidder put up a\n\nclaim for Rs. 90 Crores        with   Neyveli Lignite Corporation\n\nstating that those plants are not a re-usable condition and\n\ncan only be considered as scrap.        The learned Single Judge\n\nrefers to a news item which appeared in M/s. &#x27;Hindustantimes-\n\nnews&#x27;(website of Hindustan Times). It reveals that bidder had\n\ninduced M/s. State Trading Corporation of India to make\n\nadvance payment of Rs.149.79          Crores for purchase of the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       40</span>\n\nscrap plants on the basis of a report submitted by MMT after\n\nthey won the e-auction and thereby caused immense loss and\n\nthere is reference to the CBI enquiry.     It is found that these\n\naspects have not been considered in the impugned judgment.\n\nReason stated for cancellation of the tender is that the parties\n\nimpleaded before this Court in the earlier litigation have offered\n\nhigher amounts.       The learned Single Judge found that there is\n\nnothing indicated in the decision about the amount of such\n\noffers and about bona fides in making such offers. There is no\n\nindication that any of such parties had established any\n\nconvincing reason for their non- participation in the e-auction\n\nconducted on three occasions. The learned Single Judge found\n\nthat    observations in Ext.R1 (f) is that,     being a PSU the\n\nrespondent company had to follow transparent procedure in the\n\nsale and hence it is not in a position to accept any such offers.\n\nBut, at the same time it is found that receipt of such offers is\n\nalso mentioned as one of the reasons for cancellation. In regard\n\nto the contentions of the FACT on the aspect of public interest\n\nand protection of public money, the learned Single Judge took\n\nnote of the affidavit filed by the General Manager in the earlier\n\nlitigation wherein it is inter alia stated that the Board of\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       41</span>\n\nDirectors had decided to seek early disposal of the cases on\n\naccount of the fact that the company was loosing financially and\n\nit is a safety hazard to keep the scrapped plant any longer and\n\nfurther decided to pray for a final decision in the case of the\n\n1st respondent if no other party is willing to deposit higher\n\namount immediately.        It is further stated that the tender\n\nproceedings could not be finalised due to the pendency of the\n\nwrit petition.     The delay in the sale proceedings is having\n\nserious financial implications and it is a safety hazard to keep\n\nthe scrapped plant any longer. The learned Single Judge found\n\nthat   all other companies who intervened in the earlier writ\n\npetition had backed out from the scene, except the petitioner\n\nin W.P.(C) No. 14873/2012 and they have failed          to make\n\ndeposit of 50% as directed.     The learned Single Judge found\n\nfrom the statement which are referred to, that it is clear that\n\nthe FACT had not raised any objection against proceedings\n\nfurther on the basis of the confirmed sale. It is noted that the\n\nFACT had already incurred approximately Rs. 85 Lakhs for\n\nobtaining the valuation reports one after another and for which\n\nit incurred huge amount of Rs. 1.40 Crores for further re-\n\nauction. It is noted that the price offered is 5 Crores above the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       42</span>\n\noffer already confirmed. From Ext.R1(f) it is evident that the\n\nfirst respondent had produced Solvency Certificate for Rs.200\n\nCrores and a &#x27;Letter of Credit&#x27; for Rs.30 Crores from the Bank\n\nfor payment of the balance.        It is further noted that even\n\nthough the Chairman and the Managing Director had expressed\n\nthe view that there is likelihood of the 1st respondent claiming\n\ndamages in the event of cancellation, there is no discussion or\n\ndecision on that aspect. The learned Single Judge also referred\n\nto the fact that        scrapped plants are having 192 Nos. of\n\nReformer Tubes and that one of the members of the Board had\n\npointed out that a recent sale of scrapped &#x27;Reformer Tubes&#x27; of\n\nM/s Rashtriya Chemicals and Fertilisers Ltd. had fetched value\n\nof Rs. 1.5 Lakhs per Tube. Even calculated on that basis, the\n\ntotal value of the Tubes available will only be Rs. 288 Lakhs. It\n\nwas found that the confirmed bid in this case is Rs. 500 Lakhs\n\nmore.    This aspect was also    omitted to be considered.    The\n\nDirector (Finance) expressed doubt about the possibility of\n\nrealising any higher amount on re-tender.      The learned Single\n\nJudge found that the Board had not discussed such              a\n\ncontingency and not considered the heavy expenditure for\n\ngetting further valuation and for conducting a further e-auction.\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others        43</span>\n\nThe learned Single Judge further finds that it was on the basis\n\nof a       Fax Message received from the Joint Secretary\n\nDepartment of Fertilizers that the bid was not finalised.       The\n\nFax Message was send on the basis of a complaint submitted by\n\nM/s.Padma Cargos and Fertilizers. The nature of the complaint\n\nwas not revealed. There is silence about the further auction to\n\nprove the said complaint.     The stand of the respondent in the\n\nearlier round of litigation that they do not want to lose a bidder\n\nwho had offered such an amount was taken note of.              It is\n\nfound that the reasons now stated for a turn-around is not at all\n\nconvincing.

In      this case   no oral evidence appears to be\n\nnecessary.    At the same time,     we have also noted that in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/899629/\" id=\"a_52\">Kisan Sakhari Chini Mills Limited and others v. Vardan Linkers\n\nand others</a> (2008) 12 SCC 500), the Apex Court in a later\n\ndecision took the view that where the question whether there\n\nwas a contract or not is seriously disputed, the court is not to\n\nassume that there was a valid contract and on that basis\n\nexamine validity of administrative action. In this case what is\n\nessentially disputed is that there is no transfer of property in\n\nthe case. The other facts are not in dispute.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_83\">     25. In other words, the fact that the first respondent was\n\nthe highest bidder and appellant issued Ext.P7 confirmation of\n\nsale in favour of the appellant is not in dispute. On the said\n\nadmitted position, we have absolutely no difficulty in coming\n\nto the conclusion that there was a contract of sale which was\n\nconcluded with the issuance of Ext.P7. As to whether the\n\nproperty passed in the case is a different matter altogether.\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       45</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_84\">      26. To consider the question as to whether there is a\n\nconcluded contract and whether title in the goods has passed in\n\nthis context, it is necessary to consider the provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/651105/\" id=\"a_53\">Sale of Goods Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/879917/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 5</a> of the said Act speaks about the\n\ncontract of sale, which reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">              5. Contract of sales how made :(1).\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_85\">       A contract of sale is made by an offer to buy\n       or sell goods for a price and the acceptance\n       of such offer. The contract may provide for\n       the immediate delivery of the goods or\n       immediate payment of the price or both, or\n       for the delivery or payment by instalments,\n       or that the delivery or payment or both shall\n       be postponed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_86\">              (2). Subject to the provisions of any law\n       for the time being in force, a contract of sale\n       may be made in writing or by word of mouth,\n       or partly in writing and partly by word of\n       mouth or may be implied from the conduct of\n       the parties. &quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">Therefore, a contract of sale is made on the basis of an offer to\n\nbuy or to sell goods for a price and the acceptance of such\n\noffer. It is now necessary to go back to <a href=\"/doc/928744/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 4</a> of the Act.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\"><a href=\"/doc/928744/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 4</a> of the Act reads as follows:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">               &quot;4. Sale and agreement to sell: (1). A\n         contract of sale of goods is a contract whereby\n         the seller transfers or agrees to transfer the\n         property in goods to the buyer for a price.\n         There may be a contract of sale between one\n         part-owner and another.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">               (2). A contract of sale may be absolute\n         or conditional.\n</blockquote>\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others         46</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">                (3). Where under a contract of sale the\n         property in the goods is transferred from the\n         seller to the buyer, the contract is called a\n         sale, but where the transfer of the property in\n         the goods is to take place at a future time or\n         subject to some condition thereafter to be\n         fulfilled, the contract is called an agreement to\n         sell.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">                (4).    An agreement to sell becomes a\n         sale when the time elapses or the conditions\n         are fulfilled subject to which the property in\n         the goods is to be transferred. &quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_87\">      27. From a perusal of Sections (4) and (5), following\n\nconsequences are inevitable. On the basis of an offer being\n\naccepted as contemplated in <a href=\"/doc/879917/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 5</a>,           there would be a\n\ncontract of sale. The contract of sale is a contract whereby the\n\nseller either transfers or agrees to transfer the title in the goods\n\nto the buyer.       Under the contract of sale, if the transfer of\n\nproperty    is to take place in      future or subject to certain\n\nconditions being fulfilled, it would be regarded an agreement\n\nto sell. On the other hand, if there is a transfer of property in\n\nthe goods, it is a sale. Thus the words &#x27;contract of sale&#x27; are\n\ncapable of bearing the meaning a completed sale and also an\n\nagreement to sell.          A contract of sale may be a mere\n\nagreement to sell on the basis that while there is an offer and\n\nacceptance and a contract has emerged it remains                 an\n\nexecutory contract and it has not blossomed into a sale where\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       47</span>\n\nunder the property in the goods has passed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_88\">      28. It is on this understanding of the Law, we must\n\napply the law to the facts. In the facts of this case, we are of\n\nthe view that when the writ petitioner had offered the highest\n\namount under the auction and that offer was accepted and\n\nsale letter was issued confirming the sale in favour of the writ\n\npetitioner, there arose a contract of sale. But, that is not to\n\nsay that immediately property in the goods has passed.          In\n\norder to    ascertain whether the property in the goods        has\n\npassed, we must consider the effect of <a href=\"/doc/137624/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 19</a> of the Sale\n\nof Goods Act.      It provides inter alia that where there is a\n\ncontract for the sale     of specific or ascertained goods the\n\nproperty in them is transferred to the buyer at such time as\n\nthe parties to the contract intend it to be transferred. It further\n\nprovides that the intention is to be gathered from the terms of\n\nthe contract, the conduct of the parties and the circumstances\n\nof the case. Lastly it provides that the rules in <a href=\"/doc/726664/\" id=\"a_59\">Sections 20</a> to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1921259/\" id=\"a_60\">24</a> are    the rules for ascertaining the intention of the parties\n\nunless different intention appears. <a href=\"/doc/726664/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 20</a> being crucial,\n\nwe extract the same as follows;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">               &quot;20. Specific goods in a deliverable\n         state:- Where there is a unconditional contract\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       48</span>\n\n         for the sale of specific goods in a deliverable\n         state, the property in the goods passes to the\n         buyer when the contract is made, and it is\n         immaterial whether the time of payment of the\n         price or the time of delivery of the goods, or\n         both, is postponed.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_89\">     29. We must further consider the question as to whether\n\nit could be said that there is a sale in view of <a href=\"/doc/726664/\" id=\"a_62\">Section 20</a> of the\n\nSales of Goods Act. According to the learned senior counsel for\n\nthe appellant, there is no unconditional contract having regard\n\nto the conditions, particularly clause 11 of Ext.P5.    He would\n\nfurther contend that while the goods are specific they are not in\n\na deliverable stage and only upon issuance of delivery order it\n\nwould be in a deliverable stage. Of course, this is disputed by\n\nthe learned Senior counsel for the first respondent. He would\n\npoint out that contract has been made, at any rate, when\n\nExt.P7 was issued        the property in the goods have passed\n\nthereupon.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">     30. In this case we must notice that clause 11, at any\n\nrate, empowers the appellant to amend lot and to withdraw\n\nthe lot even after the issuance of the sale confirmation and\n\nwhat is more even after the payment of the full price. This is\n\na case where clause 11 is not challenged before us. This is a\n\ncondition which the bidders have agreed to. This cannot be\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       49</span>\n\nignored. Our conclusion would be as follows in our jurisdiction\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_63\">Article 226.</a> When the contract itself is hedged within the\n\ncondition that at any time the lot could be withdrawn it is our\n\nunderstanding under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 226</a> that the contract is not an\n\nunconditional contract if we were to ask the question as to\n\nwhat would happen if the first respondent was to resell the\n\ngoods on the basis that it has become the owner of the goods\n\nin view of the elements in <a href=\"/doc/726664/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 20</a> being present,     could it\n\nstand in the way         the appellant   amending the      lot or\n\nwithdrawing      of the lot?   We would think that it may not\n\npossible to say so as the claim for absolute ownership of the\n\ngoods is completely inconsistent with the right of the seller to\n\nabridge the quantity or to withdraw the lot itself. No doubt the\n\nlearned counsel for the first respondent would have a case that\n\nin this case there is only one lot and there can be no withdrawal\n\nof that lot as what is contemplated is withdrawal of lot when\n\nthere are more than one lots.          Even assuming that said\n\ncontention is correct nevertheless there is power to amend lot.\n\nSuch    power     detracts  from   the   contract  becoming   an\n\nunconditional contract. The power to amend the lot overhangs\n\nthe transaction like a Damocles sword.        It cannot be   said\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others         50</span>\n\nthat the buyer is the owner of certain quantity of goods. Such a\n\ncertainty is imparted only with the issuance of the delivery\n\norder.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">     31. The offshoot of the above discussion in the facts of\n\nthis case, we are of the view that while there is a contract of\n\nsale of goods, it amounts only to an agreement to sell with a\n\npower with the seller to amend the lot or to withdraw the lot.\n\nThe above said power to withdraw the lot or to amend the lot is\n\navailable till the issuance of the delivery order.      Thus, while\n\nthere is a contract of sale, it is not yet a sale. Question is as to\n\nwhether the action of FACT is arbitrary.          We would have to\n\nbear in mind several facts. This is a case where the parties\n\nwere before this Court earlier. In the litigation culminating in\n\nExt.P1 judgment        several persons     came forward     offering\n\nhigher prices. The learned Single Judge relegated them to the\n\nFACT.    The FACT was directed to take final decision in the\n\nmatter as to whether there exists any reason to cancel the bid\n\nor whether the bid should be proceeded with. The matter was\n\nplaced in the meeting for the decision of the Directors of the\n\nFACT. Different opinions were expressed. There was a view\n\nthat    better offer may not received.        There was aspect of\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others          51</span>\n\ncertain persons who        came forward offering higher amount.\n\nApparently FACT took note of the higher price fetched in the\n\nsale of assets of         Neyveli Lignite Corporation.     It also\n\nconsidered the recent sale of 192 items          Reformer Tubes\n\nby Rashtriya       Chemicals and Fertilisers Ltd.- another public\n\nsector company.         It felt that the disposal of the company&#x27;s\n\nproperty must be done in a fair and transparent manner. In\n\nmatters such as this overriding consideration which weighs with\n\nthe writ court is public interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_92\">      32. Sri. Mariarputham learned senior counsel would\n\nsubmit that there is overwhelming public interest        when the\n\ncourt takes into consideration the facts and also principle of rule\n\nof law and the need to do things fairly as a constitutional\n\nguarantee. When the State acts in a unfair and arbitrary\n\nmanner, it is breach of the rule of law. When the person is at\n\nthe receiving end of arbitrary action.          it has an adverse\n\nimpact on public interest. We are not very much impressed by\n\nthe said argument.          When     competing claims are private\n\ninterest v. public interest, then in the case of disposal of public\n\nproperty the question would be whether the right of the person,\n\nwho has earned the right to the public property in a public\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others         52</span>\n\nauction,   is to be preferred over the right of the public     in\n\nensuring    that    valuable public assets were not disposed of\n\nexcept for a fair price and in a fair and transparent manner.\n\nIn this case no doubt the writ petitioner&#x27;s bid is 5 crores more\n\nthan the highest valuation done in the studies conducted. It\n\nis also true that it is a third time that the tenders were called\n\nfor.  Whether       this Court should, in judicial review, sit in\n\njudgment over the decision of a public unit which is of the\n\nview that it need not go further ahead on the basis of Ext.P7\n\nconfirmation in favour of the writ petitioner. It is true if such\n\na decision is taken without any reasons to support it or mere\n\nipsi dixit it would be arbitrary. In this case there are reasons.\n\nThe learned Single Judge analysed      the reasons and took the\n\nview that those reasons are not correct. Is such an exercise to\n\nbe supported under judicial review principles?        In our view\n\nin matters particularly to the disposal of valuable assets by the\n\nState when the State feels that it need not proceed further on\n\nthe basis of the confirmation and it seeks to explore the\n\npossibility of getting higher price and when clause 11 permits\n\nFACT to withdraw the lot or or amend the lot, this court would\n\nbe sitting in judgment over the decision taken in a commercial\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others         53</span>\n\nmatter which may not be justified .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_93\">      33. In this regard, we think it is relevant to refer to the\n\nfollowing averments in the counter of the appellant as to what\n\ntranspired both during the pendency of the earlier writ petition\n\nand after Ext.P1 judgment was pronounced.

This respondent\n    further submits that after the decision taken by the\n    Board of Directors on 5.1.2012, 3 more firms viz.\n    M/s. Annapuram Steels Pvt. Ltd., M/s.

In the said meeting the\n    Board considered the representations submitted by\n    Annapuram Steels Pvt. Ltd., M/s. Minar Castings and\n    M/s.

It is true that there is no specific denial about the\n\npaper report and its contents in relation to      Neyveli Lignite\n\nCorporation as such.       No doubt, there is apparently some\n\ninvestigation going on. It is also true that apart from one of\n\nthe persons who offered a higher price and who has also filed\n\ntwo appeals before us,     others     have   not challenged the\n\ndecision of the learned Single Judge (No doubt some have filed\n\nimpleading petition).      But, we must pose the question\n\nwhether it is for the Court to decide in judicial review that the\n\ncontract must be specifically enforced in <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 226</a> by the\n\njudgment which is impugned.         That is  precisely what the\n\nlearned Single Judge has directed. We have already found that\n\nthere is no sale of goods as such. There is only contract of\n\nsale which amounts to an agreement to sell. Once it is found\n\nthat there is only an agreement to sell, and not a sale, then\n\nthe finding of the learned Single Judge to the contrary cannot\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others        57</span>\n\nbe sustained.      As noted, the learned Single      Judge     has\n\nproceeded on the basis that a decision to cancel &#x27;the sale&#x27; is\n\nwithout authority and is illegal. ( See para 38 of the judgment\n\nof the learned Single Judge). The learned Single Judge has\n\npurported to give reasons to         say that the findings of the\n\nauthority cannot be appreciated as acceptable or correct. It is\n\nin this regard, that we must remind ourselves the nature of the\n\njurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 226.</a> Even while the jurisdiction is\n\nvery wide, it is hedged in     with self imposed limitations. The\n\nlimitations all flow from the quality of the judicial over sight,\n\nwhich, as already noted, is not appellate. This Court does not\n\nre-appreciate the facts. It does not sit in judgment over the\n\ncorrectness or the wisdom of the authority&#x27;s decision\n\nparticularly in the field of contractual matters.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">      35.   It is true that in    the   earlier round of litigation\n\nculminating in Ext.P1 judgment the nuances of the various\n\nclauses were not considered in the manner in which it is sought\n\nto be projected before us. The resultant position is that the\n\nlearned Single Judge in Ext.P1 proceeded to direct the appellant\n\nto consider and take a decision as to whether a bid was to be\n\ncancelled,    taking note of the observations      and the legal\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_80\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       58</span>\n\nposition as also the fact that there are other persons who were\n\nprepared to pay higher prices. We are faced with the rather\n\nanomalous position in that,     we find, on our understanding of\n\nclause (11), that it is not open to cancel       a  bid which is\n\naccepted. The learned Single Judge considered the question as\n\nto whether the bid should be cancelled. On our understanding\n\nas such the bid, once it is accepted, could not be cancelled.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">But, at the same time, we are not in agreement with the\n\nlearned Single Judge when he says that there is a sale and we\n\ntake the view that there is no sale. Of course, if there was a\n\nsale, it would have been a different matter altogether.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">Therefore, we are left to finding that this is a case where\n\nthough the bid of the first respondent was accepted with the\n\nissuance of Ext.P7 sale confirmation, there still was only a\n\nconcluded contract of sale not amount to sale but remaining an\n\nagreement to sell. We can only take it that there is a refusal\n\non the part of the appellant to honour its obligation under the\n\ncontract of sale.     Therefore, what the first respondent could\n\nseek then is the specific performance of the contract of sale\n\nwhich is an agreement to sell,         therefore, an executory\n\ncontract.    In short,    the  substance  of the matter is this\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others       59</span>\n\namounts to a writ petition filed by the first respondent in\n\nessence asking the writ court to enforce an executory contract\n\nwhich is an agreement to sell. The question would whether in\n\nthe facts and and circumstances of the case, we should hold\n\nthat the refusal to honour the contractual obligations by the\n\nappellant should be interfered with by us. In our view this is a\n\ncontract involving a sale of public property. It is true that the\n\nfirst respondent offered more than 33 Crores, which is more\n\nthan 5 Crores above the highest valuation from among the\n\nthree valuation reports. The appellant felt that it should proceed\n\nto re tender the matter.        The learned Single Judge has\n\nproceeded to appreciate the matter on facts and come to the\n\nconclusion that the decision by the Board is not acceptable as\n\nthe reasons are not correct. We have already set out in detail\n\nthe reasoning of the learned Single Judge. In our view, it may\n\nnot be appropriate for us to dub it as a decision which is liable\n\nto be quashed as perverse. We cannot hold it so arbitrary as\n\nto warrant our interference.      We cannot loose sight of the\n\nprinciple which is far to well established to require reiteration\n\nthat   in respect of such contracts unless the public interest is\n\noverwhelming the court need not interfere. We are not dealing\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others         60</span>\n\nwith the matter       as Civil Court considering the    prayer for\n\nspecific performance as already noticed.      We would only think\n\nthat in exercise of writ jurisdiction, we should take a view based\n\non well established principles under which we do not see any\n\nground for overturning the decision taken by the appellant no\n\ndoubt a public sector unit. We would think that in essence the\n\nlearned Single Judge considered the matter on sitting in\n\njudgment on the issue as an appellate body. May be if we\n\nwere exercising our authority as an appellate body we may\n\nhave concurred with the learned Single Judge. But, that is not\n\nto say    that our understanding of limits of our jurisdiction\n\nshould be blurred.       Considerations like expenditure   incurred\n\nin this regard towards tender in our view       was not for the\n\nlearned Single Judge to consider.           The attitude of other\n\npersons who evinced interest in getting at the property (may\n\nbe they are not participated in the tender process as such),\n\ncannot be altogether excluded from consideration. While we\n\nare not for a moment suggesting that contracts validly entered\n\ncan be unceremoniously         and capriciously disregarded by the\n\nState, in a case where there are reasons given it may not be\n\nappropriate for the      writ petition and we again emphasise the\n\f\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">W.A.Nos.942/2013 &amp; others        61</span>\n\n&#x27;writ court&#x27;, to disregard or upset the said decisions sitting as\n\nan appellate body.       In such circumstances, we are unable to\n\nagree with the learned Single Judge.       We allow    W.A. No.\n\n942/2013, set aside the judgment of the learned Single Judge\n\nand dismiss W.P.(C) No. 9049/2012.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">      As far as W.A. No.1268/2013 and W.A.
