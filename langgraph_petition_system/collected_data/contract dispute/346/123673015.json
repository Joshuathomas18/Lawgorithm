JUSTICE MIHIR KUMAR JHA\nORAL JUDGMENT\nDate: 25-03-2015\n\n              Heard learned counsel for the parties.\n\n              2. The prayer of the petitioner in this writ application reads\n\n   as follows:\n\n              &quot;i. To issue an appropriate writ/order/direction for quashing\n              the order as contained in memo no. 2868 dated 27.6.2014\n              issued by respondent Engineer-in-Chief (Middle) Water\n              Resources Department, Govt. of Bihar whereby and\n              whereunder in exercise of power under Clause 3.3 and 4.8 of\n              the standard Bid Document (SBD) the respondents have\n              debarred the petitioner company from participating in future\n              tender.&quot;\n              3. Mr. Vikas Kumar, learned counsel appearing on behalf of\n\n   the petitioner, in support of the aforementioned prayer has basically\n Patna High Court CWJC No.12566 of 2014                                           2\n\n\n\n\n        raised only two issues. Firstly, according to him, the impugned order\n\n        has been passed without compliance of principles of natural justice,\n\n        inasmuch as the alleged show cause notice referred to in the impugned\n\n        order was never served on the petitioner. Secondly, according to him,\n\n        under the terms of the Agreement for the contract in question there\n\n        was no penal consequence of the nature to which now the petitioner\n\n        has been subjected by the impugned order. Learned counsel in this\n\n        regard has relied on the judgment of this Court in the case of M/s\n\n        NCC Ltd. v. the State of Bihar &amp; ors., reported in 2013(1) PLJR 952.\n\n                   4. Per contra, learned counsel for the State while supporting\n\n        the impugned order has firstly raised the issue of maintainability of\n\n        the writ application on the ground that the agreement in question\n\n        containing arbitration clause cannot allow the petitioner to raise the\n\n        issue in hand arising out of a non-statutory contract under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_1\">Article 226</a>\n\n        of the Constitution of India. He has also submitted that the plea of\n\n        violation of the principles of natural justice is vague, inasmuch as the\n\n        petitioner was given an opportunity by way of show cause notice but\n\n        if he did not choose to reply to the same, it cannot at least allege of the\n\n        impugned order being in violation of the principles of natural justice.\n\n        Learned counsel for the State has also submitted that the impression\n\n        of the petitioner that the impugned order was beyond the stipulation\n\n        made in the terms and conditions of the agreement is also factually\n Patna High Court CWJC No.12566 of 2014                                            3\n\n\n\n\n        incorrect and even legally impermissible, inasmuch as if a contractor\n\n        is allotted a work and does not complete the same within the\n\n        stipulated period, the Department is not required to give him further\n\n        work till completion of the work in question. Learned counsel for the\n\n        State has also sought to distinguish the judgment of this Court in the\n\n        case of M/s NCC Ltd. (supra) on facts.\n\n                   5. The relevant facts giving rise to this writ application lie in\n\n        a narrow compass. The petitioner, a Class I contractor of Water\n\n        Resources Department, was awarded a tender for execution of\n\n        renovation of Anjan Reservior Scheme in the District of Jamui having\n\n        the total score of the work to Rs.9,62,58,022/-. After acceptance of the\n\n        tender of the petitioner the Letter of Acceptance was communicated to\n\n        it on 8.3.2010 whereby and whereunder the petitioner had agreed to\n\n        complete the work in a period of one and half years i.e. on or before\n\n        14.09.2011</pre><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_1\"> in view of the date of agreement being 15.03.2010. When\n\n        for one reason or another the work was not completed by the\n\n        petitioner within the aforementioned time frame despite repeated\n\n        reminders issued by the competent authority, the Engineer-in-Chief by\n\n        a show cause notice dated 29.8.2013 had asked the petitioner to show\n\n        cause as to why it should not be declared defaulter and prohibited\n\n        from participating in any fresh tender of the department till the\n\n        completion of the work allotted to the petitioner. To that extent it\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.12566 of 2014                                                             4</span>\n\n\n\n\n        would be relevant to quote the show cause notice dated 29.8.2013, as\n\n        contained in Annexure „K‟ to the counter affidavit which reads as\n\n        follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                                                    ^^fcgkj ljdkj\n                                                 ty lalk/ku foHkkxA\n                   i=kad&amp;AA@fofo/k&amp;02&amp;04@2013 4723@iVuk] fnukad 29-08-13\n                   lsok esa]\n                           Qqykj daLVzD&#x27;ku daiuh izk0 fy0\n                           funs&#x27;kd&amp;mes&#x27;k izlkn flag\n                           xzke&amp;[kcM+k] eqgYyk&amp;vknZ&#x27;kuxj&amp;3] [kcM+k]\n                           ftyk&amp;eqtIQjiqj] fiu&amp;843146-\n                   fo&quot;k;&amp; Qqykj daUlVz&#x27;ku daiuh izk0 fy0 eqtIQjiqj dks MhQkYVj djus ds\n                   iwoZ Li&quot;Vhdj.kA\n                   egk&#x27;k;]\n                          mi;qZDr fo&quot;k;d ds laca/k esa dguk gS fd flapkbZ izeaMy la[;k&amp;A]\n                   y{ehiqj teqbZ ds ifj{ks=k/khu ukckMZ lEiksf&quot;kr vatku tyk&#x27;k; flapkbZ\n                   ;kstuk ds iquZLFkkiu dk;Z esa ,djkjukek ds vuqlkj dk;Z izkjaHk djus dh\n                   frfFk 15-03-2010 rFkk dk;Z lekIr djus dh frfFk 14-09-11 fu/kkZfjr FkkA\n                   fu/kkZfjr le; lhek ds ckn Hkh fnukad 14-04-13 rd ek= 70% gh dk;Z\n                   lEikfnr fd;k x;k gSa mDr vof/k esa le; le; ij {ks=h; inkf/kdfj;ksa\n                   }kjk funsf&#x27;kr Hkh fd;k x;k FkkA foHkkx }kjk lle; dk;Z lekIr djkus\n                   gsrq foRrh; o&quot;kZ 2012&amp;2013 esa 42-00 yk[k vkoaVu Hkh fd;k x;k Fkk\n                   ysfdu vkids f&#x27;kfFkyrk ds dkj.k 28-84 yk[k :i;s izR;kfiZr djuk iM+kA\n                               vr% mi;qZDr ds laca/k esa iUnzg fnuksa ds vUnj esa viuk Li&quot;Vhdj.k\n                   fn;k tk; fd D;ksa ugh a,djkjukfer vof/k fnukad 14-09-11 rd 80% ls\n                   de dk;Z fd, tkus ds dkj.k D;ksa ugha ,l0ch0Mh0 ds dafMdk&amp;4-8 ds\n                   rgr mhQkYVj ?kksf&quot;kr djrs gq, dk;Ziw.kZ gksus rd vxyh fufonk esa Hkkx\n                   ysus gsrq cafpr fd;k tk;A fuf&#x27;pr le; lhek rd Li&quot;Vhdj.k ugha izkIr\n                   gksus ij foHkkx ,d i{kh; fu.kZ; ysus ds fy, Lora= gksxkA\n                                                                           g0@&amp;\n                                                                       A/khjsUnz dqekjA\n                                                                    vfHk;ark izeq[k Ae/;A\n                                                                          26@8@13**\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.12566 of 2014                                                       5</span>\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">                   6.

The Full Bench of this\n\n        Court in case of <a href=\"/doc/1668479/\" id=\"a_8\">Pancham Singh</a> (supra) had laid down the law in this\n\n        regard in the following terms:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1668479\" id=\"span_12\">23. The judgments of the Supreme Court <a href=\"/doc/1668479/\" id=\"a_9\">referred to above</a>\n                   have repeatedly impressed that every action of the\n                   executive Government must be informed with reason which\n                   is part of the rule of law and its bare minimal requirement.</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">                   In the present case the work order and the agreement in\n                   favour of the petitioner has been cancelled without\n                   assigning any reason, on a ground which did not exist on\n                   the date the impugned order was issued. The step for the\n                   cancellation of the contract is said to have been taken with\n                   an object to save the public exchequer. But rule of law as\n                   interpreted by courts required the State Government to\n                   inform the petitioner that the drawing, design and the\n                   estimated cost were likely to be changed on the basis of\n                   fresh dates to be received. As such, it has to be held that\n                   action of the State does not satisfy the test of\n                   reasonableness and fair play. In my view, apart from three\n                   categories mentioned by the Supreme Court in the judgment\n                   of Radhakrishna Agarwal (supra), under the changed\n                   circumstances, there should be a fourth category of cases:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                   &quot;Where the contract entered into between the State and the\n                   person aggrieved is non-statutory and purely contractual but\n                   such contract has been cancelled on a ground, de hors any\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.12566 of 2014                                         12</span>\n\n\n\n\n                   of the terms of the contract, and which is per se violative of\n                   <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">                         Even in such cases applications under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_11\">Article 226</a> of\n                   the Constitution are maintainable.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">                   11. That would bring me to firstly decide as to whether the\n\n        present writ application arising out of a non-statutory contract in the\n\n        first place would by itself be maintainable under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 226</a> of the\n\n        Constitution of India? It is not in doubt that this issue relating to non-\n\n        statutory contract was conclusive decided by the Division Bench of\n\n        this Court in the case of M/s Radha Krishna Agrawal (supra) wherein\n\n        it was held as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                   &quot;18. ... ... ...

According to the learned counsel appearing for\n                   the petitioners the impugned actions are in exercise of\n                   executive powers by the State under <a href=\"/doc/1174818/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 298</a> of the\n                   Constitution which are amenable to the jurisdiction of this\n                   Court.

As a matter\n\n        of fact from reading of the judgment of M/s Popcorn Entertainment\n\n        (supra) it would be very clear that the City Industrial Development\n\n        Corporation (CIDC) had awarded the contract in question to M/s\n\n        Popcorn Entertainment in exercise of a statutory power governed by\n\n        the regulations framed while allotting the plot in question for\n\n        developing it in to a multiplex cinema complex. Thus, the case of M/s\n\n        Popcorn Entertainment (supra) would even otherwise be covered by\n\n        the ratio laid down in the case of M/s Radhakrishna Agarwal (supra)\n\n        where under three categories, a writ application arising out of a\n\n        statutory contract has been held to be maintainable. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1156062\" id=\"span_27\">This vital aspect\n\n        having been not noticed by the learned Single Judge in the case of M/s\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1156062/\" id=\"a_29\">NCC Ltd.</a> (supra) would not be a binding precedent for me and has to\n\n        be in fact held to be per incurium.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">                   15.

Let it be noted that after service of the\n\n        counter affidavit there is no denial to the averments made in the\n\n        counter affidavit and this Court, therefore, will have no difficulty in\n\n        holding that the show cause notice sent to the petitioner by the\n\n        Engineer-in-Chief on the declared address in the agreement on which\n\n        all the notices were given to the petitioner was served and if the\n\n        petitioner itself did not choose to answer the said show cause notice it\n\n        cannot at least complain by raising the plea of violation of principles\n\n        of natural justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"460900\" id=\"span_29\">17.

The petitioner,\n\n        therefore, relies on a communication made by it on 2.1.2011 and the\n\n        letter of the Executive Engineer dated 25.11.2011 to establish that it\n\n        was obstructed on account of inaction on the part of the respondents\n\n        in giving him site free from encumbrances including nexalite\n\n        activities. This has been sought to be categorically denied by the\n\n        respondents in their counter affidavit in paragraph no. 16 of the\n\n        counter affidavit which reads as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">                  &quot;16. That the statement regarding handing over the work site\n                  from Naxal persons is an excuse to defend the accountability\n                  for slow and un-proportional progress of the work leading to\n                  inordinate delay in completion.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">                   20. The further plea of the respondents in this regard is that\n\n        the right from the inception the progress of the work made by the\n\n        petitioner was very slow. In this regard it has been explained in the\n\n        counter affidavit, which also has not been controverted by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.12566 of 2014                                        23</span>\n\n\n\n\n        petitioner in any way by filing a rejoinder to the counter affidavit that\n\n        the progress made by the petitioner by the month of November, 2010\n\n        was only 3.1% as against the target of 55%. The petitioner has also\n\n        not denied the averments made in the counter affidavit that it was\n\n        given three reminders by way of show cause notice in relation to the\n\n        progress of work. These notices dated 7.4.2010, 6.5.2010 and\n\n        20.11.2010, as contained in Annexures „A‟, „B‟ and „C‟ to the counter\n\n        affidavit, correctness whereof has not been questioned in any manner\n\n        by filing any rejoinder affidavit, would itself go to show that the\n\n        petitioner was never very serious after being allotted a prestigious and\n\n        important work of public utility involving a huge sum of Rs. more\n\n        than 9 crores.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">                   21. Thus, if the petitioner wants to dispute all these facts,\n\n        they cannot be gone into and decided in writ proceeding and the best\n\n        place for getting this dispute to be adjudicated would be the forum of\n\n        arbitration as agreed to by the petitioner with its open eye while\n\n        entering into the agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">                   22. As a matter of fact what other materials have come on\n\n        record would go to show that the petitioner was being constantly\n\n        reminded to complete the work within the scheduled programme and\n\n        this Court has nothing to doubt the correctness of three more notices\n\n        given to the petitioner dated 24.8.2011, 28.11.2012 and 12.12.2012, as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.12566 of 2014                                        24</span>\n\n\n\n\n        contained in Annexures „D‟, „E‟ and „F‟ to the counter affidavit,\n\n        wherein again the petitioner was being repeatedly reminded by the\n\n        controlling authority as well as higher authority that its pace of work\n\n        was very slow and it must make its efforts to complete the work\n\n        within the fixed time schedule. The notice dated 12.12.2012, as\n\n        contained in Annexure „E‟, was also a clear reminder to the petitioner\n\n        that its plea for delaying the work was not correct and during the\n\n        course of site inspection by the Superintending Engineer on 1.12.2012\n\n        it was found that the work could be completed by the petitioner and\n\n        therefore, the petitioner must complete the work by 31st of March,\n\n        2013 failing which appropriate action in terms of the agreement could\n\n        be taken against him. The petitioner in fact has got no answer to it\n\n        because it has not cared to reply about these notices as clearly\n\n        mentioned in the counter affidavit and therefore, if at all it has a case\n\n        that it could not complete the work because of nexalite activities even\n\n        after expiry of a period of more than two years of stipulated period i.e.\n\n        14.9.2011, such a disputed question of fact capable of being only\n\n        resolved on the basis of oral and documentary evidence led by the\n\n        parties can be decided only in a civil suit or in arbitration proceeding\n\n        but in no event under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_37\">                   23.    The fact, which has been therefore brought by the\n\n        respondents on record, would go to show that the work, which was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.12566 of 2014                                         25</span>\n\n\n\n\n        completed by the petitioner by 14.9.2011, did not make sufficient\n\n        progress even till the month of January, 2013 because the Chief\n\n        Engineer in his notice dated 16.1.2013, as contained in Annexure „G‟,\n\n        had also informed the petitioner that the total work done by the\n\n        petitioner till that date was only 55% whereas the entire work was to\n\n        be completed by 14.9.2011. As a matter of fact when the petitioner\n\n        had virtually stopped working after April, 2013 another notice was\n\n        issued to him on 20.5.2013, vide Annexure „H‟ to the counter\n\n        affidavit, and even then no significant progress was made by the\n\n        petitioner as with regard to completion of work and in that helpless\n\n        situation the controlling authority at the level of the Superintending\n\n        Engineer and the Chief Engineer in their recommendation to the\n\n        Engineer-in-Chief vide their communications dated 25.5.2013 and\n\n        29.6.2013 had recommended to the Engineer-in-Chief to take\n\n        appropriate action against the petitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_38\">                   24. This became essential because the department had to\n\n        surrender fund on account of laxity and negligence in completion of\n\n        work of the petitioner. These facts also clearly asserted in paragraphs\n\n        no. 8 and 9 of the counter affidavit have not been controverted by the\n\n        petitioner by filing any rejoinder to the counter affidavit and therefore,\n\n        there would be no difficulty in coming to the conclusion that these\n\n        events had taken place in which the department was virtually being\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.12566 of 2014                                       26</span>\n\n\n\n\n        blackmailed by the petitioner by firstly taking a prestigious\n\n        assignment of work involving more than Rs.9 crores way back in the\n\n        year 2010 and had kept the same pending. Now every work which the\n\n        Government allots by way of tender has a fixed time frame for two\n\n        purposes. Firstly, the public purpose for which the work is to be\n\n        completed must be done within the time frame so as to it becoming\n\n        beneficial to the public at large to whom such work is being executed.\n\n        Secondly, there is an element of rise of cost on account of delay. The\n\n        contractors as a whole in this State have found a good ploy to firstly\n\n        obtain the work on any rate and therefore, keep it pending so that they\n\n        can seek extension of time on one ground or another and also keep the\n\n        expenditure increase by way of price escalation and other modes. The\n\n        present case in fact, therefore, would be a classic example as to how\n\n        the petitioner had made the department as also the general public\n\n        suffering on account of non-completion of work allotted to it.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">                   25. Can in this situation the action taken by the respondents\n\n        of declaring it defaulter and debarring it from future contract of the\n\n        same department which had allotted the work in question to the\n\n        petitioner be held arbitrary or unreasonable? In my view, certainly\n\n        not. As would be evident the show cause notice was issued to the\n\n        petitioner by the Engineer-in-Chief on 29.8.2013 i.e. almost after two\n\n        years of the stipulated date of completion of the work under the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.12566 of 2014                                       27</span>\n\n\n\n\n        agreement being 14.9.2011. The show cause notice clearly mentions\n\n        that the petitioner till 14.3.2013 had completed only 70% of the work\n\n        and as a result whereof the department had to surrender the fund of\n\n        Rs.28.83 lacs. Not only that the petitioner did not file a show cause\n\n        reply to the aforesaid show cause notice dated 29.8.2013 but even in\n\n        the writ petition no effort has been made by the petitioner to explain\n\n        that the facts mentioned in the show cause notice was in any way\n\n        incorrect.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">                   26. All that has been said by way of pleading in the writ\n\n        petition is that there were naxalite activities, as a result whereof the\n\n        petitioner could not complete the work. That however could be hardly\n\n        an answer in the matter of completion of work. If the petitioner had\n\n        found that the site was not free it could have straightway determined\n\n        the contract as per the terms and conditions of the agreement in\n\n        inception but the very fact that the petitioner has been able to\n\n        complete 70% of work in a space of four years in place of 100% work\n\n        to be completed in one and half year, there would be no difficulty in\n\n        coming to the conclusion that the petitioner after obtaining the\n\n        contract in fact is only trying to delay the work for its own gains and\n\n        also for getting the other works by claiming experience of this work.\n\n        Judging from this angle of public interest the Government and the\n\n        Department had every reason to discourage such nefarious activity of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.12566 of 2014                                       28</span>\n\n\n\n\n        the contractor and this Court would not find anything wrong in the\n\n        impugned order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_41\">                   27.    The last limb of submission of Mr. Vikas Kumar,\n\n        learned counsel for the petitioner, that under the contract and the\n\n        stipulation made in the agreement though the department could have\n\n        cancelled the contract of the petitioner and determined the agreement\n\n        or could have taken any other action against the petitioner but it could\n\n        not have declared the petitioner defaulter or could have debarred from\n\n        taking work in future till completion of the work is also not palatable\n\n        to me for more than one reason. Firstly, the award of contract was as\n\n        per the terms and conditions of the agreement. Any contractor when it\n\n        is awarded work it has to abide by those terms and conditions. That is\n\n        how in the agreement the following documents were deemed to form\n\n        part of and construed as part of the agreement, namely.\n\n</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">                   i.

Secondly, in what circumstances or upon\n                   what, occasion is the person daiming to be entitled to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.12566 of 2014                                           40</span>\n\n\n\n\n                   exercise the measure of control entitled to intervene.&quot; To\n                   put the same matter tersely borrowing the phrase of Lord\n                   Denning. &quot;Every thing depends on the subject matter&quot;. In\n                   my view, unless the Court is of the opinion that the\n                   occasion or circumstances for the exercise of power is such,\n                   that it would be unfair or unjust to the party affected by\n                   action taken, to be visited by the consequences thereof,\n                   unless it had been given an opportunity to have his say in\n                   the matter, the principles of natural justice are not\n                   attracted. In my view the exercise of contractual right is not\n                   such an occasion. There is nothing unjust or unfair in a\n                   party terminating a contract, even without giving the other\n                   party an opportunity to have his say in the matter, on the\n                   basis of the express right conferred by the contract itself.\n                   The very nature and occasion of the exercise of right\n                   flowing as it does from the contract, is such as to exclude\n                   the applicability of the rules of natural justice. Further it is\n                   to be observed that when a right to terminate a lease, on the\n                   ground of the existence of conditions which give a right of\n                   termination, has been exercised, it is open to the party\n                   exercising the option to justify the action taken, if properly\n                   challenged, not only on the grounds which were under\n                   contemplation when the action was taken, but also on other\n                   grounds which are available in law to the contracting party\n                   in terms of the agreement. This is an additional reason as\n                   to why rules of natural justice cannot be held to be\n                   attracted in cases where a lease has been terminated in\n                   terms of the contract itself.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_55\">                                                    (Underlining for emphasis)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\"> Patna High Court CWJC No.12566 of 2014                                      41</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1056935\" id=\"span_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1156062\" id=\"span_57\">36.

The aforesaid underlined stipulations made in the\n\n        agreement have been quoted in extenso only for the purpose to show\n\n        that the competent authority of the department has been vested full\n\n        power and authority to take action against the contractor and\n\n        therefore, it will be very difficult for this Court to accept the\n\n        submission of the petitioner that in no event any action can be taken\n\n        against the contractor by the authorities of the department and such a\n\n        decision, as to whether any default was committed by the contractor,\n\n        has to be decided only by a neutral person. That again would be firstly\n\n        going into the terms and conditions of the contract and that too a non-\n\n        statutory contract which cannot be in view of law <a href=\"/doc/1156062/\" id=\"a_54\">laid down by</a> the\n\n        Apex Court in the case of Radha Krishna Agrawal (supra) at least\n\n        enforced by a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of\n\n        India. Secondly as per stipulation made in Clause 3 and 14 of the\n\n        Agreement if the contractor makes a default or causes breach of terms\n\n        and conditions it is the competent authority of the department who has\n\n        been vested power to take appropriate action not only for\n\n        determination of contract but also taking other penal measures.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_74\">                   41.
