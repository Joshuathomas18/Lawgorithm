The          claimant       -   opponent         Aniha     Corporation          is     a\n\nproprietor             firm   managed      through        its    proprietor           Shri\n\nChetankumar Ramanlal Shah. The Aniha Corporation is\n\ninterested in the development of land and therefore, it\n\nentered into an agreement with the appellant Sardar Sarovar\n\nNarmada Nigam Limited (&#x27;SSNNL&#x27; hereinafter).\n\n\n2.2. A tender was invited by SSNNL by issuing public\n\nadvertisement in the newspaper for the lease of plot no.2\n\nadmeasuring 2064 sq.mtrs situated at Gandhinagar Airport\n\nRoad       on     LHS         downstream,      Mouje      Sughad          of     District\n\nGandhinagar. A plot was to be developed for tourism purpose\n\nand the development was to take place as per the terms and\n\nconditions mentioned in the tender. The claimant - opponent\n\nbeing the successful bidder, the SSNNL agreed to entered\n\ninto the lease agreement with it. The SSNNL agreed to lease\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                       Page 2 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                                                 Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n    C/FA/2544/2015                               JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\nout the plot no.2 to the opponent on payment of premium\n\nequivalent to the market value to develop the said property\n\nand on acceptance of the tender, a communication was sent in\n\nwriting on 15.02.2007. A cheque of Rs.19,50,000/- was issued\n\non 26.02.2007 and the additional security of six months&#x27; rent\n\nto the tune of Rs. 60,000/- had been also given.\n\n\n2.3. A lease deed came to be executed after the parties\n\nentered      into   the   understanding        on   05.06.2007.             The\n\nconstruction plan was prepared by the respondent and\n\narchitecture design also was made. It was sent for the\n\napproval as per the terms and conditions of the agreement to\n\nthe appellant on 11.10.2007.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">\n2.4. It was averred by the opponent that the request was\n\nmade to process the plan so that the project can be proceeded\n\nfurther. A communication was also sent to the Executive\n\nEngineer, Narmada Canal Section 4 to verify and approve the\n\nplans. It was sent to the Gandhinagar Urban Development\n\nAuthority      (GUDA)     and   Ahmedabad       Urban       Development\n\nAuthority (AUDA). There was a request that after once it is\n\nsanctioned, the same is to be sent to the SSNNL. After about\n\n10 months, a communication was received by the opponent\n\nthat it cannot construct multi storied building and the plans\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                Page 3 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                      Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n    C/FA/2544/2015                           JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\nwere sent back to the opponent. It was insisted that the\n\nopponent was also get the plan sanctioned from the local\n\ndevelopment authority.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">\n2.5. According to the opponent before 05.08.2008, on regular\n\nbasis, the payment was made of the rent and frequent\n\ninquiries were made with the corporation with regard to the\n\nprocess whether was in the right direction. On 12.09.2008, it\n\nwas communicated by the appellant to the opponent -\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">claimant that it should start the development of subject plot\n\nand submit the schedule of development. It also was asked to\n\nget the sanction of the Urban Development Authority for the\n\nconstruction plan. It is all throughout alleged by the opponent\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">- claimant that the appellant failed to fulfill the obligations of\n\nverifying and approving the construction plans and getting\n\napproval from the appropriate authorities since the subject\n\nland was owned by the appellant. The grievance on the part\n\nof the opponent - claimant is that it never supplied the\n\ninformation as requested for and therefore for want of\n\nnecessary details and on the ground of zoning which had been\n\nasked for by the order, the matter got delayed.\n\n\n2.6. On 15.12.2008, the opponent was informed that the\n\nNarmada Main Canal had a special structure and had a\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                             Page 4 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                  Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n    C/FA/2544/2015                                         JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\ncertificate in that regard. In wake of the background of AUDA\n\nregulations and restrictions, it was not possible to carry out\n\nthe construction as per the plan. A communication was also\n\nreceived by the opponent to get the plan sanctioned with the\n\nlocal development authority and it was promised the permit\n\nuse of places surrounded the subject plot as condition no.5 of\n\nthe tender agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">\n2.7. It was since not legally feasible to develop the plot at\n\none stage, it was asked to take a revised plan. Eventually a\n\nstand was taken by the appellant and the lease deed was\n\nterminated as the opponent - claimant failed to develop plot\n\nno.2 in a given time period. The termination was imposed with\n\nimmediate           effect   from   the       date   of    communication               i.e.\n\n07.02.2011. The premium amount and the rent amount paid\n\nby the claimant had been forfeited and the possession of plot\n\nhad been restored to the SSNNL immediately. This, according\n\nto the opponent, is a clear case of breach of contractual terms\n\nand conditions / obligations and assurance given to the\n\nopponent       and       therefore,      it    challenged         the      notice        of\n\ntermination of lease agreement as contrary to law.\n\n\n2.8. On breach of provisions of <a href=\"/doc/515323/\" id=\"a_1\">Transfer of Property Act</a> on\n\naccount of forfeiture of lease, the legal notice had been issued\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                      Page 5 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                                                Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n    C/FA/2544/2015                              JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\nseeking reference to the arbitration under the provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_2\">Arbitration Act</a> and request was made for the arrangement of\n\nsole arbitrator.

The\n\nArbitrator before the Apex Court had taken recourse to the\n\nEmden formula which is widely accepted.

Intervention of the court is envisaged in few\n\ncircumstances, in case of fraud or bias by the arbitrators or\n\nviolation of natural justice. The court cannot correct errors of\n\nthe arbitrators.

It also was held that once the matter is referred to the\n\narbitrator within a reasonable time, the party invoking the\n\narbitration clause may proceed on the basis that the other\n\nparty to the contract has denied or disputed his claim or is not\n\notherwise interested in referring the dispute to the arbitrator.\n\n\n10.3.

According to the Court,\n\nby proposing the development of land, the very object of lease\n\nwas being frustrated and therefore, if the public property is\n\nnot put to use for the purpose for which it was meant, it chose\n\nto uphold the action of the respondent. The market value of\n\nthe land was approximately 12.50 crores. The compromise\n\nwas suggested for the issue by accepting refund of 50% of the\n\nforfeited amount.

The decision of <a href=\"/doc/383637/\" id=\"a_13\">Dina Nath v.

When anyone attempts to usurp the\n\npublic property under the garb of development of land, and\n\nwhen that very object of lease is being frustrated by the party,\n\nwhich is dishonest and untrue, the Court has chosen to come\n\ndown heavily upon such litigants.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">\n13.2.            At the same time, the decision of this Court which\n\nis heavily banged upon by the appellant of course has similar\n\nfacts.        In SCA 4753 of 2011, as discussed above, the\n\ntermination of lease deed and forfeiture of the amount of\n\npremium and the amount of advance rent taken was upheld by\n\nthe Court essentially on the ground that one of the clauses of\n\nlease deed had permitted termination of lease deed and the\n\nforfeiture of the advance rent and premium. It was also a case\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                Page 20 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                                      Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n       C/FA/2544/2015                            JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\nwhere requisite permissions and approvals were to be\n\nobtained by the lessee who was to develop the land within a\n\nstipulated time period. It was also obligated to complete the\n\ntask of construction with all amenities. In absence of any\n\ndevelopment in a period of two years, after the service of legal\n\nnotice, when the lease deed was terminated with the\n\nforfeiture of the amount of premium and advance rent, the\n\nCourt did not find any illegality.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">\n13.3.            It is to be noted that the petitioner of the above\n\npetition had called in question the decision of Sardar Sarovar\n\nNarmada Nigam Limited dated 25.03.2011 and the lease deed\n\nof 14.07.2008 had been terminated with an amount of\n\npremium of Rs. 1 crore along with forfeiture of advance rent.\n\nIt was straightway challenged under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India before this Court without approaching\n\nany other Court for the process of arbitration. The Court\n\nchose to intervene in a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India and the matter thereafter travelled to the\n\nApex Court by preferring Civil Appeal No. 187 of 2018. It is\n\nnot clear whether lease deed had any clause of arbitration.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">14.              The fact remains that in the matter on hand, there\n\nhas been no direct Writ Petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 226</a> of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                Page 21 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                                                      Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n    C/FA/2544/2015                               JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\nConstitution of India nor is there any attempt to overreach the\n\nprocess of alternative remedy. The arbitration clause was\n\ninvoked and the parties went to the learned Arbitrator under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_17\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act</a> and the present appellant\n\nsince was aggrieved, it moved the Civil Misc.

The competence\n\nand jurisdictional part of the Arbitrator has also not been\n\nquestioned. The Court also therefore was of the opinion that\n\nany objection to the jurisdiction of the Arbitrator should be\n\ndeemed to have been waived of. The Court also sought to rely\n\non the decision of the Apex Court rendered in case of Union of\n\nIndia vs. M/s. Pam Development Private Limited; reported in\n\n2014 (11) SCC 366 to hold that when there was no challenge\n\nto the appointment, that aspect of appointment of the\n\narbitrator becomes final and final. The District Court also\n\nrelied on the decision of the Division Bench of this Court\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                              Page 22 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                      Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n       C/FA/2544/2015                             JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\nwherein in Clause 38 it speaks that provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_19\">Arbitration Act</a> would be applicable in case of dispute between\n\nthe parties. It also held that in case of dispute between the\n\nparties, the award of the Arbitrator appointed under the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_20\">Arbitration Act</a> would need to be treated as final.\n\n\n14.2.            Thus, not only there is a clause incorporated in the\n\nlease deed itself of appointment of the arbitrator but, the\n\narbitrator also had been appointed who had extensively dealt\n\nwith all the issues which have been raised by the rival parties\n\nand when the outcome of the judgment and award of the\n\narbitrator was challenged, the District Court, Gandhinagar\n\nfound no substance and therefore, the application made under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 34</a> of the said Act has been dismissed in limini.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"22663809\" id=\"span_49\">15.

Judgment in case of <a href=\"/doc/996348/\" id=\"a_23\">Mcdormott International Inc. vs.\n\nBurn Standard Co.</a> (supra), speaks of the 1996 Act which\n\nmakes provision for the supervisory role of the Courts, for the\n\nreview of arbitral award only to ensure fairness. In case of\n\nfraud or bias by the arbitrators, the Court is not expected to\n\ncorrect the errors of the arbitrators. It can only quash the\n\naward leaving the parties free to begin the arbitration again,\n\nif it is desired. Thus, the scheme of provision, as per <a href=\"/doc/996348/\" id=\"a_24\">the said\n\ndecision</a>, is to keep the supervisory role of the Court at\n\nminimum. Expediency and the finality offered by the process\n\nof arbitration has been expected by the litigants. The mis-\n\nconscious decision of excluding the Court&#x27;s jurisdiction should\n\nnot be forgotten by the Court when it is asked to perform the\n\nsupervisory role. The Court also went to an extent of saying\n\nthat the term of contract can be express and implied. The\n\nconduct of the parties would also be a relevant factor in a\n\nmatter of construction of a contract. The construction of\n\ncontract agreement is within the jurisdiction of arbitrators\n\nhaving regard to the wide nature, scope and ambit of\n\narbitration agreement and they cannot be said to have\n\nmisdirected themselves into passing of the award by taking\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">                             Page 24 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                                   Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n    C/FA/2544/2015                             JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\ninto consideration the conduct of the parties. It is also trite\n\nthat the correspondences exchanged by the parties are\n\nrequired to be taken into consideration for the purpose of\n\nconstruction of contract.

In this decision, so far as the aspect of interest is\n\nconcerned, it has been held by the Apex Court that the power\n\nof arbitrator to award interest for pre-award period, interest\n\npendent lite and interest post-award period is not in dispute.\n\n<a href=\"/doc/114615517/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 31(7)(a)</a> provides that the arbitral tribunal may award\n\ninterest, at such rate as it deems reasonable, on the whole or\n\nany part of the money, for the whole or any part of the period\n\nbetween the date on which the cause of action arose and the\n\ndate on which award is made i.e., pre-award period. The\n\nquestion is as to whether the interest is to be paid on the\n\nwhole or the part of the amount or whether it should be\n\nawarded in the pre-award period would depend upon the facts\n\nand circumstances of each case. The discretion needs to be\n\nexercised by the arbitral tribunal as regards (i) at what rate\n\ninterest should be awarded, (ii) whether interest should be\n\nawarded on whole or part of the award money, and (iii)\n\nwhether interest should be awarded for whole or any part of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                              Page 25 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                                                    Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n       C/FA/2544/2015                                    JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\nthe pre-awarded period.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"260676\" id=\"span_57\">16.2.            The 1996 Act provided for 18% of interest whereas\n\nin the matter before the Apex Court, the rate of interest\n\ngranted by the arbitrator was 10% for the principal amount as\n\nalso for the interim. The interest was up to the date of award\n\nas also the future interest was at the rate of 18% per annum.\n\nConsidering the long lapse of time, the Apex Court held that\n\nthe respondent may have to pay the huge amount by way of\n\ninterest and therefore, it directed the award to carry interest\n\nat the rate of 6% per annum instead of 18% per annum, in\n\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/260676/\" id=\"a_26\">Pure Helium India (P) Ltd.

With this background, if one considers the facts of the\n\ninstance case, the appellant is a Government Company\n\nincorporated under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_28\">Companies Act</a>. The respondent Aniha\n\nCorporation is a proprietary firm which entered into a tender\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                                     Page 26 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                                              Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n    C/FA/2544/2015                           JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\nagreement with the SSNNL for the purpose of laying canal. A\n\npublic advertisement had been issued for grant of 30 years of\n\nlease of earmarked plot adjacent to the Narmada Main Canal.\n\nThe respondent had given his offer in relation to Plot No. 2\n\nadmeasuring 2064 sq.mtrs for the plot located at Gandhinagar\n\nState Highway.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">\n17.1.         The purpose was for development of tourism\n\nactivities on the said leasehold plot. The respondent being the\n\nhighest bidder in the tender process, his bid was accepted for\n\nthe lease of plot no.2 on 15.02.2007. The respondent paid the\n\namount of Rs. 39.50 lakhs through cheque to the appellant on\n\n26.02.2007 and also additional security deposit of six months&#x27;\n\nrent fees being the sum of Rs. 60,000/-.

The record is indicative of the fact that the\n\nconstruction plan and architectural design were prepared by\n\nthe respondent and sent to the appellant on 11.10.2007 as\n\nalso on 30.10.2007. The SSNNL was required to approve the\n\nplan which is the condition precedent for putting up the\n\nconstruction.

They continued to be with the\n\nrespondent for about 10 months and on 05.08.2008, the\n\nappellant rejected the same on the ground that multistoried\n\nbuildings were impermissible and therefore changes were\n\nnecessary. The appellant was also asked to approach the local\n\nauthority         and   get   the   plan      sanctioned.      Therefore,           on\n\n12.09.2008, the plans had been submitted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">18.              Essentially on four grounds the appellant had\n\nblamed the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">\n18.1.            The tender had been floated for the development of\n\ntourism and the activities to be carried out was of children\n\npark, disco theater, landscape garden, fountain park etc. The\n\nrespondents are alleged to have failed in complying with the\n\ncondition nos. 26 and 27 of the tender document although,\n\nthere was no permanent construction to be put up unless the\n\nlocal or urban authority grants such permission. The approval\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                    Page 28 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">                                                            Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n    C/FA/2544/2015                            JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\nfor permanent construction ought to have been obtain from\n\nthe AUDA, AMC etc.\n\n\n18.2.         Again, the agreement entered into by way of lease\n\ndeed was on &quot;as is where is&quot; basis. The stipulated time period\n\nfor taking permission and approval of development was six\n\nmonths from the date of signing of the lease agreement and\n\nconstruction was to be completed in two years&#x27; period. This\n\ntime limit was not adhered to and it is alleged to be a clear\n\nbreach of agreement entitling the appellant to terminate the\n\ncontract and forfeit the amount deposited.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">\n18.3.         The third aspect which is alleged against the\n\nappellant is that the obligation to pay the monthly rent was\n\nupon the lessee and on expiry of terms granted to the lessee,\n\nhe was to hand over the vacant and clear possession of the\n\nproperty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_61\">\n18.4.         So far as the fourth point is concerned, it was\n\nalleged that the respondent had visited the site as a successful\n\nbidder before entering into the formal lease agreement. He\n\nwas also aware of leaving of margin and other provisions for\n\nputting up construction. According to the appellant, the\n\nreliance placed on the communication of AUDA dated\n\n01.12.2010 is impermissible as the same was not addressed to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_65\">                             Page 29 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                                   Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n       C/FA/2544/2015                            JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\nthe respondent and moreover, the said document is indicative\n\nof the fact that there was no attempt made to get the plans\n\napproved.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_63\">19.     Thus, all in all, according to the appellant, termination of\n\ncontract cannot be found faulted with. It could be noticed that\n\nlearned Arbitrator has dealt with each of the four contentions\n\nelaborately and threadbare.

By an exhaustive discussion, the arbitral tribunal\n\nhas held that the lease deed in the present case is voidable\n\ndocument in as much as when the same was executed,\n\nbecause of the Government Resolution of the year 1980 as\n\nwell as Ribbon Development Rules in GGCR Norms, there was\n\nno scope for the development of the plot and hence, the\n\nagreement was void and not binding to the respondent.\n\nLearned Arbitrator has held in no unclear terms that the\n\nleased plot was not available for the appropriate use for the\n\npurpose for which it was intended to be leased. Learned\n\nArbitrator also lamented the fact that when the plot was\n\nleased out for a special purpose, it would be obligatory on the\n\npart of the appellant to satisfy the tribunal that plot could\n\nhave been successfully developed by tourism activities.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                                Page 30 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                                      Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n    C/FA/2544/2015                           JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\n\n19.2.         In totality of the facts and circumstances, the\n\ntribunal was of the opinion that the respondent could have\n\nkept himself aware of the Ribbon Development Rules at the\n\ntime of entering into the agreement with the appellant -\n\nCorporation but the appellant was equally unaware about the\n\nfacts and the laying of the service road as also of the Ribbon\n\nDevelopment Rules, GGCR guidelines. The appellant&#x27;s conduct\n\nis clear that it was of the view that permanent construction is\n\npossible and permissible in the area and the respondent was\n\nnot responsible for the failure since the plot was not available\n\nfor the appropriate use for the purpose of which it was leased\n\nand it also clearly held that an act of termination of contract\n\nby the respondent is a face-saving exercise as there was no\n\nenforceable or executable agreement. The Managing Director\n\nof the company at one point of time was convinced that plot\n\nno.2 was wrongly placed at the bidding process. The question\n\nof termination of contract could not have arisen and in fact,\n\nthe respondent could have called and offered the refund of the\n\namount paid, accepting the error. It went to an extent of\n\nsaying rightly that the forfeiture of the amount was illegal and\n\nimproper and had respondent been aware that he would not\n\nbe in a position to develop the plot as a prudent businessman,\n\nhe would not have definitely paid the amount of premium.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">                            Page 31 of 34</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                                                  Downloaded on : Sun Jan 16 14:17:54 IST 2022</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">       C/FA/2544/2015                            JUDGMENT DATED: 13/09/2021\n\n\n\nThere are valid and satisfying reasons given for calculating\n\nthe amount of damage under the head of loss and damage.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">20.     Coming to the issue of interest, it has chosen to grant\n\n18% interest from 30.06.2008 till realization.
