On these suppositions the limited\n                                    scope of adjudication is confined to decide as to\n                                    whether appellant is under an obligation to take back\n                                    these workmen in service. Obviously, it is not the\n                                    reflective of the real dispute between the parties. It\n                                    not only depicts the version of the respondents\n                                    workmen, but in fact accepts the same viz. they are\n                                    the employees of the appellant and mandates the\n                                    Labour Court/ Industrial Tribunal to only decide as to\n                                    whether the appellant is required to take them back in\n                                    its fold. On the contrary, as pointed out above, the\n                                    case set up by the appellant is that it was not the case\n                                    of transfer of the workmen to M/s Lafarge but their\n                                    services were taken over by M/s. Lafarge which is a\n                                    different company/ entity altogether. It is further held\n                                    that though the jurisdiction of the Tribunal is confined\n                                    to the terms of reference, but at the same time it is\n                                    empowered to go into the incidental issues. Had the\n                                    reference been appropriately worded, probably it was\n                                    still open to the appellant to contend and prove that\n                                    the       Respondent     workmen         ceased          to     be       their\n                                    employees. However, the reference in the present\n                                    form does not leave that scope for the appellant at all.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"996728\" id=\"span_99\">11.8.

If the contract is sham and\n                                not genuine, then the Workmen of the so called\n                                contractor can establish their case that they were always\n                                the employees of the principal employer and for claiming\n                                the appropriate service condition.
