A few hours after\n\ninvocation of the Bank Guarantee, intimation was served to the appellant by\n\nway of e-mail. Thus, without any prior notice as required under Clause 4.2\n\nof the GCC notifying the defects, the Bank Guarantee had been invoked and\n\nit is contrary to the terms of the contracts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">      (i) Aggrieved by the unceremonious manner in which the Bank\n\nGuarantees were invoked by CMRL, the appellant-Company filed\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">Page No.11/69</span>\n\f                                                 O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nO.A.Nos.246 and 247 of 2020 under <a href=\"/doc/1041122/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 9(ii)(d)</a> of the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, challenging the invocation and encashment of the said\n\nBGs.

By order dated 08.07.2020, the\n\nlearned Single Judge granted an order of status-quo till 17.07.2020. The\n\norder of this Court had been communicated to both the Banks, but, so far as\n\nUnion Bank of India is concerned, they have immediately released the\n\namount after invocation of the BG in respect of contract UAA-05. So far as\n\nthe IDBI Bank is concerned, in adherence to the order passed by this Court,\n\nthey have restrained themselves from making the payment to CMRL in\n\nrespect of the contract UAA-01.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">      5. Before the learned Single Judge, the appellant(s) vehemently\n\ncontended that the Bank Guarantees were invoked without following due\n\nprocedures or by complying with the conditions agreed under the BG\n\nContracts. Thus, it was contended that there is a violation of the terms and\n\nconditions of the BG on the part of the first respondent-CMRL. It was also\n\ncontended that the invocation of BG by the first respondent-CMRL is not in\n\ncompliance with the specific and relevant clauses of the underlying contract.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">Page No.12/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nFurther, the terms and conditions of the BG were drafted by the first\n\nrespondent-CMRL themselves and therefore, when two interpretations are\n\npossible, the one in favour of the appellant(s) had to be adopted, applying\n\nthe principle of &#x27;contra-proferentem&#x27;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">      6. The submissions of the appellant(s) were countered by both the\n\nrespondents, inter-alia, contending that there was a delay in execution of\n\nboth the contract works and they were only partially completed. According\n\nto the respondents, the works were completed by the appellant(s) beyond\n\nthe date of completion prescribed under the contract(s) as well as the\n\nrevised completion date.       Even after the issuance of Taking Over\n\nCertificate(s), major portions of the works have been left incomplete. When\n\nthe appellant(s) failed to complete the contract within the period prescribed,\n\nthe respondents are wholly justified in invoking the Bank Guarantees.\n\nTherefore, the first respondent-CMRL prayed for dismissal of the Original\n\nApplications filed by the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">      7. The learned Single Judge, after elaborate discussion, dismissed\n\nthe Original Applications in O.A.Nos.246 and 247 of 2020 on the ground\n\nthat Clause 4 of the Bank Guarantee in both the contracts, makes it clear\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">Page No.13/69</span>\n\f                                                   O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nthat the Bank has agreed to pay the full amount covered under the Bank\n\nGuarantee. Further, as per the conditions stipulated in the Bank Guarantee,\n\nthe Banks are bound to pay the amount covered under the Bank Guarantees.\n\nIt was also further observed that if the liability comes lesser than B.G. in the\n\nevent of encashment of entire Bank Guarantee, it is always open to\n\napplicant(s) to recover the differential amount from the respondent(s). The\n\nlearned single Judge also rendered a finding that whether or not the\n\napplicant(s) had received a lesser amount, is not a dispute raised anywhere,\n\nexcept while advancing argument before this Court. Thus, it was held by\n\nthe learned Single Judge that the appellant(s) has not made out a prima-facie\n\ncase for grant of injunction and the balance of convenience is not in their\n\nfavour.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">      8. Mr.G.Masilamani, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\nappellant(s) in O.S.A.No.174 of 2020, submitted that invocation of BG\n\nshould be strictly in accordance with the contract agreement. If it is not in\n\nconsonance with the contract agreement, the invocation itself is bad. In this\n\nregard, the learned Senior Counsel invited the attention of this Court to\n\nClause 5 of the BG, wherein it had been clearly stated as follows:\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">Page No.14/69</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">\f                                                O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\n                &quot;After the Contractor has signed the aforementioned\n      Contract with the Employer, the Bank is engaged to pay the\n      employer, any (BG) amount up to and inclusive of the\n      aforementioned full amount upon written order from the\n      Employer to indemnify the Employer for any liability of\n      damage resulting from any defects or shortcomings of the\n      Contractor or the debts he may have incurred to any parties\n      involved in the Works under the Contract mentioned above,\n      whether these defects or shortcomings or debts are actual or\n      estimated or expected. ....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">      9. By referring to the above Clause, the learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for the appellant(s) submitted that the core or essence of the BG\n\nis to indemnify the employer towards any liability or damages, resulting\n\nfrom any defect or shortcomings of the work undertaken by the contractor.\n\nTherefore, to &quot;indemnify&quot; is a condition to compensate or to make good the\n\nloss. While so, the employer must indicate a specific amount, either actual\n\nor estimated or expected loss/damages, as referred to in the BG, which is\n\none of the conditions precedent for invocation of the Bank Guarantees. The\n\nfirst respondent/CMRL is forbidden from making any demand for\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">Page No.15/69</span>\n\f                                                   O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\ninvocation of the entire Bank Guarantee amount(s), without specifying the\n\nactual amount of loss. In the instant case, in the invocation letter sent by the\n\nfirst respondent-CMRL, dated 06.07.2020 to the Bank, no specific amount\n\nwas mentioned and therefore, invocation of BG itself is bad in law. For\n\ninvocation of the BGs, the sine-qua-non shall be the first respondent/CMRL\n\nsustaining any liability out of damage resulting from any defects or any\n\nshortcomings of the work done by the appellant(s). The first respondent-\n\nCMRL, without even mentioning or asserting it, had sustained any liabilities\n\nof the damage, resulting from any defect or shortcomings of the contractor,\n\ninvoked the BGs. Thus, the invocation of the BG is not in terms of the\n\nconditions stipulated in the BG itself. In fact, the letter of invocation dated\n\n06.07.2020 sent by the first respondent-CMRL is totally silent about the\n\nbreach or non-compliance of the terms of the underlying contract. In the\n\nabsence of allegation of defect or shortcomings committed by the contractor\n\n(TTA-JV), the invocation of BG itself is not warranted.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">      10. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants in\n\nO.S.A.No.174 of 2020, further submitted that, the Bank ought not to have\n\npaid the entire BG amount to the first respondent-CMRL. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1754916\" id=\"span_11\">In this regard, the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">Page No.16/69</span>\n\f                                                O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nlearned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant(s) relied upon a\n\njudgment of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1754916/\" id=\"a_5\">Hindustan Construction\n\nCompany Vs. State of Bihar</a> reported in 1998 (8) SCC 436, wherein, the\n\nApex Court has held that Bank Guarantee furnished by a contractor is, in\n\nitself, an independent contract. The relevant portion of the judgment is as\n\nfollows:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                &quot;9.   ... ... The terms of the bank guarantee are,\n      therefore, extremely material. Since the bank guarantee\n      represents an independent contract between the bank and the\n      beneficiary, both the parties would be bound by the terms\n      thereof. The invocation, therefore, will have to be in\n      accordance with the terms of the bank guarantee, or else, the\n      invocation itself would be bad.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">      11. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant(s) further\n\nsubmitted that in an identical case, reported in 2015 SCC Online Madras\n\n8193 (M/s.Gammon OJSC Mosmetrostory JV Vs. CMRL), this Court\n\nheld that JV agreement, the contract agreement and BG, are inter-linked\n\nwith each other and therefore, it cannot be said that such BG furnished by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">Page No.17/69</span>\n\f                                                   O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nthe respective Banks is to be treated as an independent contract. Though, in\n\nthe case on hand, the learned Single Judge had relied on the above said\n\njudgment of this Court in M/s.Gammon OJSC Mosmetrostroy JV case,\n\nwith a generalised statement, had come to the conclusion that the BG is an\n\nindependent contract, failed to test the letter of BG invocation in the light of\n\nthe terms and conditions in the BG contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">      12. The next fold of submission of the learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for the appellant(s) in O.S.A.No.174 of 2020, is that the\n\ninvocation of BG is not in accordance with the specific clauses of the\n\nunderlying contract, relied in the BG contract, and therefore, invocation of\n\nBG is unsustainable in law. In this regard, the learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for the appellant invited our attention to Clause 6 of the BG,\n\nwhich reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">             &quot;Clause 6 (a): This Guarantee is valid until 10/04/2015\n      (The initial period for which this guarantee will be valid must\n      be for at least twenty eight (28) days longer than the\n      anticipated date of issue of the Taking-Over Certificate as\n      stated in Sub-Clause 10.1 of the &quot;Conditions of Contract Part\n      I).\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">             Clause 6(b) : In accordance with CPA Clause 7 of\n      Volume 2, a new Guarantee may be issued for 2.5% of the\n      Contract Price after issuance of Taking-Over Certificate, and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">Page No.18/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\n      this Guarantee shall be valid at least twenty eight (28) days\n      longer than the anticipated date of issue of the Performance\n      Certificate, unless the Tenderer decides to extend the\n      Guarantee required under item 6(a), for the same period.&quot;\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">      13. By relying upon the above said Clause 6, the learned Senior\n\nCounsel appearing for the appellant(s) in O.S.A.No.174 of 2020 contended\n\nthat the validity of the BG must be for at least 28 days longer than the\n\nanticipated date of issue of the Taking-Over Certificate mentioned in sub-\n\nclause 10.1 of GCC. The first respondent-CMRL also agreed to reduce the\n\nBG amount from 7.5% to 2.5% of the contract price, by replacing the BG\n\nafter issuance of Taking Over Certificate under UAA-05 Contract\n\n(O.S.A.No.173 of 2020). So far as UAA-01 contract (O.S.A.No.174 of\n\n2020) is concerned, even after issuance of Taking-Over Certificate, CMRL\n\ninsisted the appellant to extend the BG of 7.5% of the contract price despite\n\nsubstantial completion of works. Therefore, the demand of the first\n\nrespondent-CMRL for extending the total BG amount of 7.5% of contract\n\nprice under UAA-01 contract, without reducing it to 2.5% as had been done\n\nin the case of UAA-05 contract, is neither tenable nor justifiable.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">Page No.19/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">      14. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants further\n\nsubmitted that Clause 6(b) of the BG refers to Taking Over Certificate\n\nunder Clause 10.1 of GCC and the relevant Clause 10.1 and also Clause\n\n10.2, read as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">      &quot;Clause 10: Employer&#x27;s Taking Over:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">      10.1: Taking-Over Certificate: Except as stated in sub-clause\n      9.4, the Works shall be taken over by the Employer when they\n      have been completed in accordance with the Contract (except\n      as described in sub-paragraph (a) below), have passed the\n      Tests on Completion and a Taking-Over Certificate for the\n      Works has been issued, or has deemed to have been issued in\n      accordance with this Sub-Clause.

By relying upon the above Clauses, the learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for the appellants in O.S.A.No.174 of 2020 submitted that after\n\nhaving issued the Taking Over Certificate, the first respondent-CMRL\n\ncannot dilute or render this Clause ineffective, by qualifying the Taking\n\nOver Certificate as &#x27;part&#x27;. The word &#x27;part&#x27; should mean the completed work,\n\nwhich could be put to use for the intended purpose as stated in Clause 10.1\n\nof GCC. There are minor works to be completed, but, when compared to the\n\nmajor part of the work completed by the appellant, what remains to be done\n\nis only minuscule. Such non-completion of minor works, is a negligible\n\nportion for the work, which cannot be a ground to prevent or stop the use of\n\nthe work that were already completed. In fact, Clause 7 of the CPA and\n\nClause 6(b) of the BG are only referring to Taking Over Certificate. The BG\n\ncontract nowhere specify that the taking over must be either full Taking\n\nOver Certificate or part Taking Over Certificate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">Page No.22/69</span>\n\f                                                 O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">         16. Be that as it may. According to the learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for the appellants, as on date, the works had been substantially\n\ncompleted which could stand testimony to the fact that Metro Rail had\n\ncommenced its operations for public use. In other words, the intended\n\nobject was achieved by the first respondent-CMRL, by heralding the Metro\n\nRail to public use. In such circumstances, the invocation of BG does not\n\narise.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_31\">         17. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellants further\n\nproceeded to contend that BG is not an unconditional and independent\n\ncontract, as it contains conditions and refer to clauses in the underlying\n\ncontract. In this regard, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\nappellants referred to Clause 5 of the Performance BG contract, relevant\n\nportion of which reads as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">               &quot;5. .... to indemnify the Employer for any liability of\n         damage resulting from any defects or shortcomings of the\n         Contractor or the debts he may have incurred to any parties\n         involved in the Works under the Contract mentioned above.\n         ....&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">Page No.23/69</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">      18. Thus, it is submitted by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for\n\nthe appellants in O.S.A.No.174 of 2020 that, Clause 5 indicates that\n\ninvocation of the BG is warranted only in the event of any liability of\n\ndamage as a consequence of the works undertaken or in the event of\n\nshortcomings on the part of the appellant(s)/contractor(s). In other words,\n\ninvocation of the BG totally depends upon the fulfilment of conditions of\n\nthe contract. The learned Senior Counsel also invited the attention of this\n\nCourt to Clause 4.2 of the contract relating to performance security, wherein\n\nit has been stated that as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">              &quot; .. .. prior to making a claim under the performance\n       security, the employer shall in every case notify the contractor\n       stating the nature of the default for which the claim is made.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">      19. Therefore, it is submitted that prior to making a claim under the\n\nperformance security, the first respondent-CMRL shall put the appellant on\n\nnotice indicating the nature of defect for making a claim. In the instant case,\n\nno such notice was sent to the appellant(s), but the first respondent invoked\n\nthe Bank Guarantee. Therefore, the attempt on the part of the first\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">Page No.24/69</span>\n\f                                                   O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nrespondent-CMRL to invoke Bank Guarantee is in violation of the terms\n\nand conditions of the contract. After invoking the Bank Guarantee, the first\n\nrespondent sent a notice to the appellant. Even in the notice, it was not\n\nmentioned about the nature of default committed by the appellant for which\n\nthe first respondent-CMRL has invoked the Bank Guarantee. Therefore, the\n\nentire action of the first respondent in invoking the performance guarantee,\n\nis in violation of the terms and conditions of the Bank Guarantee.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_35\">      20. It is the further submission of the learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for the appellant(s) that, though the learned counsel for the first\n\nrespondent-CMRL relied on number of decisions before the learned Single\n\nJudge, in support of his contention that the Courts seldom interfere with\n\ninvocation of Bank Guarantee, all those judgments are factually\n\ndistinguishable. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"170925516\" id=\"span_21\">In this context, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for\n\nthe appellant(s) relied on the judgment in the case of <a href=\"/doc/170925516/\" id=\"a_6\">Padmasundara Rao\n\nvs. State of Tamil Nadu and others</a>, reported in 2006 (3) SCC 533,\n\nwherein the Constitutional Bench has held that Courts should not place\n\nreliance on decisions without discussing as to how the factual situation fits\n\nin with the fact situation of the decision on which reliance is placed.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Page No.25/69</span>\n\f                                                    O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"450457\" id=\"span_23\">21. The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the appellant(s) in\n\nO.S.A.No.174 of 2020, relied on yet another decision of the Apex Court, in\n\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/450457/\" id=\"a_7\">Oriental Insurance Co., Ltd., vs. Smt. Raj Kumari &amp; others</a>\n\nreported in 2007 (12) SCC 768, wherein, it was observed that reliance on a\n\ndecision without looking into the factual background of the case before the\n\nCourt, is clearly impermissible. A decision is a precedent on its own facts.\n\nEach case presents its own features. Each case depends on its own facts and\n\na close similarity between one case and another, is not enough, because a\n\nsingle significant detail may alter the entire aspect.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">      22. Therefore, according to the learned Senior Counsel appearing for\n\nthe appellant(s), the judgment relied on by the learned counsel for first\n\nrespondent-CMRL before the learned Single Judge will not apply to the\n\nfacts of the present case with reference to the conditions of Bank Guarantee,\n\nwhich are not similar in the cases relied on. This is more so that, in the\n\npresent case, the Bank Guarantee offered by the appellant was conditional\n\nBank Guarantee and not unconditional Bank Guarantee in view of Clauses\n\n5, 6 and 7 of the terms and conditions of the Bank Guarantee. The Bank\n\nGuarantees have to be read along with the underlying contract and the Bank\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">Page No.26/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nGuarantees depends on the underlying contract. Further, Clauses 5, 6 and 7\n\nof the Bank Guarantee depends on Clause 7 of underlying contract for the\n\npurpose of furnishing the performance security as Bank Guarantees and the\n\nvalue of such Bank Guarantees corresponds to the contract price. The\n\nvalidity and value of the Bank Guarantee of 7.5% of the contract price, is\n\nenforceable, until the issuance of the Taking Over Certificate. Similarly, the\n\nvalue of the 2.5% of the Bank Guarantee of the contract price is valid and\n\nenforceable at least 28 days longer than the anticipated date of issue of\n\nperformance certificate described under Clause 12.9 of the contract.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_38\">      23. Similarly, Clause 7 of the Bank Guarantee refers to an extension\n\nof time contemplated under sub-clause 8.3 of the GCC and CPA 28 and\n\nother clauses of underlying contracts for extending the validity of Bank\n\nGuarantee by the bankers. Therefore, Clauses 2, 3, 5, 6 and 7 of the Bank\n\nGuarantees refers to and depends on the conditions of the underlying\n\ncontract. Clause 7 of the Bank Guarantee specifically states that if the\n\ncontractor fails to discharge himself of the liability or damages or debts, as\n\nstated in Clause 5 of the Bank Guarantee for extending the validity of the\n\nBank Guarantee by the banker, shows that the revocation of the BG totally\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">Page No.27/69</span>\n\f                                                 O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\ndepends upon the conditions in the underlying contract. Thus, the\n\nperformance security Bank Guarantees were furnished only as a requirement\n\nunder sub-Clause 4.2 of the contract. Further, under Clause 6(a) of the Bank\n\nGuarantee, the validity is interlinked with issue of Taking Over Certificate\n\nunder sub-clause 10.1. Thus, the enforceability of the Bank Guarantees\n\noffered by the appellant(s) totally depends upon the clauses in the\n\nunderlying contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_39\">      24. As last submission, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\nappellants in O.S.A.No.174 of 2020 submitted that the invocation of the BG\n\nby the first respondent-CMRL is not tenable due to special equities and\n\nwhen Covid-19 Pandemic had severely crippled all activities in India. On\n\n22.03.2020, the Government of India called for Janata Curfew for the\n\nclosure of all activities to prevent the spread of Covid-19 by invoking the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1166740/\" id=\"a_8\">Disaster Management Act, 2006</a>, whereby a nation-wide lock-down was\n\nannounced. On account of this extraordinary situation, business houses\n\nincluding appellants&#x27; , stood paralysed and financially stressed beyond all\n\nproportions and the appellants requested the Court to take judicial notice of\n\nthe same. Thus, the learned Senior counsel for the appellants prayed for\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Page No.28/69</span>\n\f                                                 O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nsetting aside the order passed by the learned Single Judge and to allow these\n\nappeals.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"24807\" id=\"span_27\">25.   Mr.V.Raghavachari,     learned   counsel   appearing    for   the\n\nappellant(s) in O.S.A. No.173 of 2020 submitted that, the two Bank\n\nGuarantees furnished by the appellant(s) are subject to certain conditions,\n\nwhereas, the learned Single Judge applied the principle of unconditional\n\nBank Guarantee and rendered a finding that the Bank Guarantee is an\n\n&quot;independent contract&quot;.    It is his contention that Clause 4.2 of GCC\n\nindicates that, prior to invoking the Bank Guarantee, the contractor must be\n\nput on notice regarding the default committed, which prompted the first\n\nrespondent-CMRL to enforce the Bank Guarantee with utmost haste. In this\n\nregard, the learned counsel relied on the judgment in Radhakrishan\n\nRaghavan Nair vs. M/s. Consul Consolidated Private Limited and\n\nothers reported in 2015 (3) Law Weekly 882, wherein, this Court, while\n\ninterpreting a similar clause in enforcing the Bank Guarantee, held that the\n\nBank Guarantee was conditional. It was also held that, when arbitration\n\nproceedings have been initiated and it is pending and the alleged loss\n\nsuffered is yet to be determined, an injunction was granted from enforcing\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">Page No.29/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nthe Bank Guarantee. For the same proposition, the learned counsel also\n\nrelied on the decision in <a href=\"/doc/24807/\" id=\"a_9\">Punjab National Bank Limited vs. Sri Bikram\n\nCotton Mills Limited and another</a>, reported in AIR 1970 SC 1973, in\n\nwhich, it has been observed by the Apex Court that a &quot;guarantee&quot; is towards\n\n&quot;indemnity&quot;. To stake the claim, the first respondent-CMRL must have\n\nsuffered loss. The alleged losses have been disputed by the appellants, and\n\nthe same can only be decided by an Arbitrator after looking into evidence\n\nrecorded. The invocation of Bank Guarantee was before 30 days of claim\n\nand therefore, it was held that such invocation is not proper.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_41\">      26. It is the further submission of the learned counsel for the\n\nappellant(s) in O.S.A.No.173 of 2020 that, in the instant case also, the\n\nalleged loss is disputed by the appellants. Therefore, even in this case also,\n\na direction may be issued to keep the Bank Guarantee alive, pending the\n\nArbitration proceedings, especially when the project has been implemented\n\nand it was put to public use.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1960318\" id=\"span_29\">27. The learned counsel for the appellant(s) in O.S.A.No.173 of 2020\n\nalso invited our attention to two Taking Over Certificates in respect of\n\nContract UAA-05 and three Taking Over Certificates relating to UAA-01\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">Page No.30/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nand submitted that, subsequent to the issuance of Taking Over Certificates,\n\nthe first contract was put to public use on 14.05.2017 and the second\n\ncontract was put to use on 25.05.2018 (Corridor II) and 10.02.2019\n\n(Corridor I).    Having issued the Taking Over Certificates, the first\n\nrespondent is estopped from invoking or enforcing the Bank Guarantee. In\n\nthe instant case, the employer has two options under Clause 10.1 of the\n\nGCC, to issue a &quot;Taking Over Certificate&quot;, subject to satisfactory\n\ncompletion of work or to reject the application of the contractor for issuing\n\nTaking Over Certificate.      In the instant case, the application of the\n\nappellants was accepted without being rejected. Now, the entire Metro Rail\n\nhas been put to public use. Therefore, even if the Taking Over Certificate is\n\nnot explicitly issued for a portion of work, if it is put to use, then it is\n\ndeemed to be taken over. Even otherwise, the fundamental dispute involved\n\nin this case is the invocation of Bank Guarantee, after conceding satisfactory\n\ncompletion of the work and issuance of Taking Over Certificate.             To\n\nstrengthen this submission, the learned counsel for the appellants relied on\n\nthe decision of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1960318/\" id=\"a_10\">Larsen &amp; Toubro Limited\n\nvs. Maharashtra State Electricity Board and others</a>, reported in 1995 (6)\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">Page No.31/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nSCC 68, wherein, it has been observed that encashment of Bank Guarantee\n\nis to be restrained once trial and performance test is complete and the plant\n\nwas taken over. Therefore, according to the learned counsel for the\n\nappellants, when Taking Over Certificate had been issued in this case, the\n\nemployer is deemed to have been satisfied with the performance of work by\n\nthe appellants. In this case, absolutely, there is no justification in invoking\n\nthe Bank Guarantee after issuing the Taking Over Certificates.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"548131\" id=\"span_32\">In this\n\ncontext, reliance was placed on a decision of the Delhi High Court in the\n\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/548131/\" id=\"a_11\">Crest Communication vs. State Bank of India</a>, reported in 2000\n\nArb.L.R 352, wherein, it has been held in similar circumstance that\n\ninvocation of Bank Guarantee is unjust and arbitrary.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">      28. As next fold of his submission, it is contended that the first\n\nrespondent-CMRL is a party to the agreement. When the first respondent\n\nalleges that there is a breach of contract, the Bank Guarantee furnished by\n\nthe appellants cannot be unilaterally invoked by the first respondent,\n\nwithout any adjudication as regards the nature and extent of default alleged\n\nis adjudicated by an independent authority. It is his contention that the first\n\nrespondent-CMRL, on its own concluded that default was committed by the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">Page No.32/69</span>\n\f                                                 O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nappellant(s) and without quantification or assessing the default, invoked the\n\nBank Guarantee even without a prior notice as required under the contract.\n\nThe right of the first respondent-CMRL to invoke the Bank Guarantee is\n\nsubject to certain conditions. When there is an arbitration proceeding\n\npending for determination of the dispute as to who has caused delay or\n\nbreached the terms and conditions of the contract, the first respondent-\n\nCMRL, which is a party to the agreement, cannot arbitrarily invoke the\n\nBank Guarantee. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"338650\" id=\"span_34\">In this context, the learned counsel for the appellants in\n\nO.S.A.No.173 of 2020 placed reliance on a decision of the Supreme Court\n\nin the case of <a href=\"/doc/338650/\" id=\"a_12\">State of Karnataka vs. Shree Rameshwara Rice Mills</a>,\n\nreported in 1987 (2) SCC 160, wherein, it has been held that a party to the\n\nagreement cannot be an &quot;arbiter&quot; in his own cause and assessment of\n\ndamages has to be made by an independent authority as per the contract.\n\nThus, he contended that invocation of Bank Guarantee by the first\n\nrespondent is unjust and arbitrary. In such event, the invocation of Bank\n\nGuarantee by the first respondent-CMRL is unconscionable and lacks bona-\n\nfide.</span> For the same proposition, he also relied on the judgment of the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of JC India Limited vs. Union of India,\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">Page No.33/69</span>\n\f                                                 O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nreported in 2011 (5) SCC 758.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_44\">      29. Further, the learned counsel for the appellants in O.S.A.No.173 of\n\n2020 proceeded to contend that to invoke the Bank Guarantee, there should\n\nbe an admitted claim or a sum that has been adjudicated by the Arbitral\n\nTribunal. In the instant case, both are absent. Therefore, the question of\n\ninvocation of Bank Guarantee does not arise, especially when the\n\nappellant(s) are disputing the alleged defects. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"152816036\" id=\"span_36\">In this context, the learned\n\ncounsel for the appellant(s) in O.S.A.No.173 of 2020 relied on a decision in\n\nthe case of <a href=\"/doc/152816036/\" id=\"a_13\">Gangotri Enterprises Limited vs. Union of India</a> reported in\n\n2016 (11) SCC 720, wherein injunction was granted by the Supreme Court\n\nfor invocation of Bank Guarantee, since the claims are disputed and pending\n\nfor adjudication.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">      30. As next submission, the learned counsel for the appellant(s) in\n\nO.S.A.No.173 of 2020 submitted that, &quot;unconscionability&quot; is a ground to\n\nrestrain invocation of Bank Guarantee and it is an internationally recognised\n\nprinciple for grant of injunction. In this regard, he placed reliance on a\n\ndecision of a foreign judgment of Court of Appeal of Singapore in the case\n\nof BS Mount Sophia Pte Ltd., vs. Join-Aim Pte Ltd., (2012) 3 SLR 352,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Page No.34/69</span>\n\f                                                 O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nwherein it was held that &quot;unconscionability&quot; is a recognised principle to\n\ngrant injunction restraining invocation of Bank Guarantee in order to\n\nprotect the integrity of the contractor.   Relying on this judgment, it is\n\nsubmitted that in the present case, invocation of Bank Guarantee is\n\nimproper, especially when arbitration proceedings are yet to be initiated in\n\nthis case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_46\">      31. The learned counsel for the appellants in O.S.A.No.173 of 2020\n\ninvited our attention to the invocation letter dated 06.07.2020 and submitted\n\nthat it did not satisfy the pre-requisites of a valid call and hence it lacks\n\nbona-fide. He further submitted that Clause 5 of the Performance Guarantee\n\nprovides that it could be invoked only for liability of damage resulting from\n\nany defects or shortcomings or the debts the contractor may have incurred to\n\nany parties involved in the works under the contract. Therefore, it is his\n\ncontention that existence of an admitted defects or shortcomings, is a pre-\n\nrequisite for invocation of Bank Guarantee, which is conspicuously absent\n\nin this case. Further, as per Clause 4.2 of GCC, notice of default is to be\n\nmade prior to invocation of Bank Guarantee. The letter dated 06.07.2020\n\nsuffers from vagueness, inasmuch as there is no clear specification of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">Page No.35/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\ndefects made by the appellants, nor the loss allegedly suffered by the first\n\nrespondent-CMRL. The letter merely states that &quot;certain obligations were\n\nnot fulfilled&quot;. According to the learned counsel for the appellants, such a\n\nreference made in the letter will not satisfy the terms and conditions of\n\nClause 4.2 of GCC and in such event, the invocation of Bank Guarantee\n\nitself is not proper. There is also no quantification of damage made in the\n\ninvocation of letter. For the minuscule work allegedly unperformed, there is\n\nno need to encash the Bank Guarantee. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1028767\" id=\"span_39\">In this context, the learned counsel\n\nfor the appellant(s) relied on a decision of the Delhi High Court in the case\n\nof M/s.Rawal <a href=\"/doc/1028767/\" id=\"a_14\">Construction Co., vs. Union of India and another</a>, reported\n\nin AIR 1977 Delhi 205, wherein, it has been held that invocation letter does\n\nnot fulfil the requirements of the Bank Guarantee for invoking the same.\n\nTherefore, the performance guarantee had not been validly invoked.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_47\">      32.

Therefore, only a Partial\n\nCompletion Certificate was issued for the portion of works that were\n\ncompleted. The final Taking Over Certificate with effect from 15.07.2018\n\nwas subsequently issued on 27.08.2018 along with the list of minor\n\noutstanding works and snags that were to be completed during the defect\n\nliability period. After issuance of the final Taking Over Certificate, as per\n\nCPA 7, GCC 4.2, the performance Bank Guarantee (BG) which was\n\noriginally furnished for 7.5% of the contract value, was revised to 2.5%.\n\nThis BG is valid upto 26.08.2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_49\">      34. Similarly, as far as Contract UAA-01 (in O.S.A.No.174 of 2020)\n\nis concerned, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first respondent-\n\nCMRL submitted that inspite of several outstanding works, a partial Taking\n\nOver Certificate was issued on 09.02.2019 with a list of balance works and\n\nsnags. The balance works are required to be completed within reasonable\n\ntime, but the appellant/companies have not completed the works by\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Page No.37/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nadhering to the time schedule. Therefore, the first respondent-CMRL had\n\ndecided to complete the work by engaging third parties at the risk and costs\n\nof the appellant /companies. Since the appellant(s) was relieved from\n\nexecuting the work in UAA-01, the performance BG value was not reduced\n\nto 2.5% in UAA-1 contract.         In fact, their request for reducing the\n\nperformance BG value was also rejected.        The learned Senior Counsel\n\nappearing for the first respondent-CMRL further stated that it is incorrect to\n\nstate that the defects in the work were not notified by the first respondent-\n\nCMRL to the appellant(s)/companies before invoking the BG. The delay in\n\nbalance works, snags and defects were notified by the first respondent-\n\nCMRL during the period 2018 to 2020. Despite pointing out the defects and\n\nrectification works, the appellant refused to accept the same. The defects in\n\nboth the contract works are recurring in nature. In fact, there were leakages\n\nin the tunnels and station area, which are serious defects with long term\n\nconcerns for safety and structural stability. The life span of the\n\nconstructions is 120 years, and therefore, the first respondent-CMRL\n\nincurred not less than Rs.900 crores on remedial works in each contract.\n\nTherefore, the first respondent-CMRL is left with no other alternative\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">Page No.38/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nexcept to invoke the Performance BG to recover the costs incurred and\n\nexpected to be incurred on account of the various defects and shortcomings\n\nincluding poor workmanship in execution of the contracts by the appellants.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_50\">      35. With regard to the submission made by the learned Senior\n\nCounsel/learned counsel for the appellants that, the BG was invoked\n\nwithout notifying the defects to the appellants as per Clause 4.2 of the GCC,\n\nit is replied by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first\n\nrespondent-CMRL that, the first respondent, by letter dated 06.07.2020,\n\ninformed to the appellants-JV that, it was constrained to make a claim\n\nagainst the &quot;performance security&quot; due to various defaults. Prior to letter\n\ndated 06.07.2020, numerous letters were sent to the appellants, notifying the\n\nnature of various defaults committed by the appellants. All those letters\n\nwere referred to in the letter dated 06.07.2020. Absolutely, there was no\n\nresponse or objection to these letters by the appellants. The first respondent-\n\nCMRL presented the original BG to the respective Banks on 07.07.2020 for\n\nencashment. The original BG in respect of O.S.A.No.173 of 2020 relating to\n\ncontract UAA-05 was acknowledged by the Union Bank of India. So far as\n\nO.S.A.No.174 of 2020 relating to contract in UAA-01 is concerned, when\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">Page No.39/69</span>\n\f                                                 O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nthe original BG was submitted to the Bank, the same was acknowledged\n\nwith endorsement &quot;received after business hours will be processed next\n\nworking day&quot;.

Therefore, so far as the\n\ncontract UAA-5 is concerned, even before the interim order was\n\ncommunicated, the amount was released and so far as the contract UAA-01\n\nis concerned, since the order was received by the Bank prior to transferring\n\nthe monies, the money was not released by the Bank.

In our considered opinion, if the bank guarantee\n     furnished is an unconditional and irrevocable one, it is not open\n     to the bank to raise any objection whatsoever to pay the\n     amounts under the guarantee. The person in whose favour the\n     guarantee is furnished by the bank cannot be prevented by way\n     of an injunction in enforcing the guarantee on the pretext that\n     the condition for enforcing the bank guarantee in terms of the\n     agreement entered between the parties has not been fulfilled.\n     Such a course is impermissible. The seller cannot raise the\n     dispute of whatsoever nature and prevent the purchaser from\n     enforcing the bank guarantee by way of injunction except on\n     the ground of fraud and irretrievable injury.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_53\">      38.

In this regard, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\nfirst respondent-CMRL submitted that it is well settled legal principle that\n\nno order of injunction could be granted against invocation of unconditional\n\nBG, except in two exceptional circumstances:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_19\">      (i) where a party is able to establish egregious fraud and\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">      (ii) where there is irretrievable injury.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_54\">      39. Thus, it is submitted by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for\n\nthe first respondent-CMRL that the BG provides that the amount shall be\n\npaid by the Bank notwithstanding any dispute(s) raised by the appellants in\n\nany suit or proceedings pending before any Court, Tribunal or Arbitrator(s)\n\nand the liability under the BG shall be absolute and unequivocal.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">      40. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"854142\" id=\"span_48\">In the above context, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\nfirst respondent-CMRL relied upon a decision of the Supreme Court\n\nreported in 2007 (8) SCC 110 (<a href=\"/doc/854142/\" id=\"a_17\">Himadri Chemicals Industries Ltd. Vs.\n\nCoal Tar Refining Co.</a>), wherein it is held that, while dealing with an\n\napplication for injunction in the course of commercial dealings, when an\n\nunconditional Bank Guarantee or Letter of Credit is given or accepted, the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">Page No.43/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nbeneficiary is entitled to realise such a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of Credit\n\nin terms thereof, irrespective of any pending disputes relating to the terms of\n\nthe contract. In the matter of invocation of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of\n\nCredit, it is not open to the Bank to rely upon the terms of the underlying\n\ncontract between the parties. It was further held by the Apex Court in that\n\ndecision that, the Bank giving such Guarantee, is bound to honour it as per\n\nits terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. Since a Bank\n\nGuarantee or a Letter of Credit is an independent and a separate contract,\n\nthe existence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a\n\nground for issuing an order of injunction to restrain enforcement of Bank\n\nGuarantees or Letter of Credit. It was further held by the Supreme Court in\n\nthat decision that the Courts should be slow in granting an order of\n\ninjunction to restrain the realisation of a Bank Guarantee or a Letter of\n\nCredit. According to the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first\n\nrespondent-CMRL, in the instant case, the learned Single Judge had come to\n\na categorical conclusion that there was no material to infer any fraud\n\nrelating to the execution of the BG. The appellants have not raised any\n\nground challenging the said finding. Therefore, the said finding had reached\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">Page No.44/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nfinality.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">       41. It is further stated by the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\nfirst respondent-CMRL that the appellants have also failed to make out a\n\ncase under the ground of irretrievable injury with regard to the invocation of\n\nBG. The only contention of the appellants is that they will be put to\n\nirretrievable injury, if the BG is invoked during the &quot;pandemic&quot;. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_51\">In this\n\nregard, the learned Senior Counsel appearing for the first respondent-CMRL\n\nrelied upon a judgment of the Supreme Court reported in 1988 (1) SCC 174\n\n(<a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_18\">U.P. Co.op. Federation Ltd. Vs. Singh Consultants and Engineers (P)\n\nLtd.</a>), wherein it was held that irretrievable injury means &quot;special equities&quot;.\n\nThe reasons stated by the appellant(s) do not qualify as an irretrievable\n\ninjury. In fact, the Notification of the Government on 22.03.2020 for lock-\n\ndown on account of the Covid-19 Corona pandemic, had been subsequently\n\nwithdrawn on 18.05.2020, and therefore, the appellant(s) cannot place\n\nreliance on the said Notification.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1342691\" id=\"span_52\">42.

Mr.P.H.Arvind Pandian, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\nfirst respondent-CMRL (Cross objector in Cross Objection Nos.36 and 37\n\nof 2020) invited the attention of this Court to <a href=\"/doc/150591478/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 9(2)</a> and (3) of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_24\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act</a>, which reads as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">       &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 9</a>: Interim measures, etc., by Court:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">       .. ...\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">              (2) Where, before the commencement of the arbitral\n       proceedings, a Court passes an order for any interim measure\n       of protection under sub-section (1), the arbitral proceedings\n       shall be commenced within a period of ninety days from the\n       date of such order or within such further time as the Court\n       may determine.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">              (3) Once the arbitral tribunal has been constituted, the\n       Court shall not entertain an application under sub-section (1),\n       unless the Court finds that circumstances exist which may not\n       render the remedy provided under <a href=\"/doc/318136/\" id=\"a_26\">section 17</a> efficacious.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">Page No.47/69</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">      45. Sub-<a href=\"/doc/168483340/\" id=\"a_27\">section 9 (3)</a> of the said Act opens with, &quot;Once the Arbitral\n\ntribunal has been constituted&quot;. In the instant case, no Arbitral Tribunal had\n\nbeen constituted so far. From a reading of <a href=\"/doc/150591478/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 9(2)</a>, it is evident that the\n\nCourt may pass an order as an interim measure of protection under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_29\">Section\n\n9(1)</a> of the Act before the &quot;commencement of arbitration proceedings&quot;, but\n\nthe appellant(s) ought to have commenced the arbitral proceedings within\n\n90 days from the date on which the Court grants an interim measure of\n\nprotection. In the instant case, as an interim measure,       status-quo was\n\ngranted by the learned Single Judge on 08.07.2020, and the same continued\n\nfrom time to time until the order dated 14.08.2020 was pronounced. The\n\nlearned Single Judge, while dismissing the applications, at the request of the\n\nappellants, instructed the counsel for the second respondent-Banks to\n\nmaintain &quot;status-quo&quot; till 21.08.2020 and if the appeal is not filed within\n\nthat time, it is open for the Bank to encash the amount. At the time of\n\nhearing the appeals on 20.08.2020, this Court recorded that the status-quo\n\nas on date to be maintained. Though the said order of status-quo granted by\n\nthis Court still continues, the appellants had not taken any steps to\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_57\">Page No.48/69</span>\n\f                                                 O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\ncommence the arbitral proceedings in the manner prescribed under the\n\nContract, even after the lapse of 90 days from the date of the interim order\n\npassed by the learned Single Judge on 08.07.2020. Therefore, absolutely\n\nthere is no intention to arbitrate and under such circumstances, the interim\n\norder had lapsed and the appeals are liable to be dismissed. In this regard,\n\nthe learned Senior Counsel appearing for the cross-objectors relied on a\n\ndecision of a Division Bench of this Court reported in 2018 (2) CTC 241\n\n(DB) (Archer Power Systems Private Limited VS. Kohli Ventures\n\nLimited and others), wherein, it has been held as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"122362\" id=\"span_58\">&quot;8(o). .. ... Even after the contesting respondent,\n        namely, Cascade Singapore, the second respondent, entered\n        appearance and filed applications for vacating and suspending\n        the interim order, Archer India did not do anything. Archer\n        India had not triggered/invoked the arbitration clause even\n        when the order came to be passed by the learned Single\n        Judge. Arhcer India had done nothing towards triggering the\n        arbitration thereafter too. Ultimately, Archer India has done\n        so only on 28.06.2017 a day before filing the instant intra-\n        court appeal. Therefore, we have no hesitation in holding that\n        the learned single Judge was correct in coming to the\n        conclusion that Archer India had not exhibited its intention to\n        arbitrate, much less manifest intention to arbitrate. Manifest\n        intention to arbitrate is a sine qua non for moving the Court\n        under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 9</a> of the A and C Act and obtaining the interim\n        order when <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 9</a> application is moved before\n        commencement of arbitral proceedings.

Unlike the part of large scale\n        amendments to <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_35\">A and C Act</a>, when Firm Ashok Traders was\n        written, now the statute gives 90 days&#x27; time to a <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_36\">section 9</a>\n        applicant to trigger the arbitration proceedings. In our view,\n        this does not mean that a <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 9</a> applicant need not show\n        any immediacy or imminence in triggering arbitration. In fact,\n        the very prescription of a very short period like 90 days under\n        sub-section (2) of <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 9</a> itself is to emphasis the intention\n        of the statute makers that a <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_39\">section 9</a> applicant should be able\n        to demonstrate immediacy and imminence, though the\n        position that 90 days period is available to a <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_40\">section 9</a>\n        applicant to trigger the arbitration under the statute itself is\n        indisputable. With this observation, in the light of the core\n        issues that fall for our consideration in the instant case, we are\n        of the further view that it would suffice to say that we have\n        noticed that the arbitration trigger notice has been sent only a\n        day prior to filing of the instant appeal and leave the matter to\n        rest at that in this case.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">               &quot;11(u). .. In the instant case, we notice that <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 9</a>\n        application was filed before commencement of arbitration\n        proceedings. There is no difficulty in accepting the\n        proposition that <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 9</a> application can be filed before\n        commencement of arbitration. In fact, law is very well settled\n        that it can be filed before, during and/or after arbitration\n        proceedings.

As per Clause 4.2 of the GCC, the appellants have furnished\n\nperformance Bank Guarantee, dated 30.12.2010 for 7.5% of the contract\n\nprice in respect of UAE-05 performance BG for a sum of Rs.77,36,250/-\n\nfrom Union Bank of India. In respect of UAA-01, the appellants have\n\nfurnished performance Bank Guarantee of Rs.117,51,07,500/- from IDBI\n\nBank. In respect of UAA-05, after issuance of Taking Over Certificates,\n\ndated 27.08.2018, as per Clause 4.2 of GCC read with CPA-7 and Clause 6\n\nof BG, the first respondent reduced the BG to 2.5% from 7.5%. Thereafter,\n\na revised performance BG dated 16.10.2018 for Rs.25,77,48,750/- from\n\nUnion Bank of India in favour of first respondent was issued with a validity\n\ntill 26.08.2020 was executed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">      54.

Now, both the projects covered under UAA-01 and UAA-05, have\n\nbeen put to public use. In other words, UAA-01 commenced commercial\n\noperations from 25.05.2018 (Corridor-2) and 10.02.2019 (Corridor-1)\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">Page No.56/69</span>\n\f                                                 O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nrespectively and in respect of UAA-05, commercial operations commenced\n\nfrom 14.05.2017.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">      56. At this juncture, the first respondent-CMRL sent a letter dated\n\n06.07.2020 to the respective Banks to invoke the Bank Guarantees offered\n\nby the appellant(s). On coming to know about the attempt on the part of the\n\nfirst respondent-CMRL to invoke the Bank Guarantee, that too without\n\nspecifying the amount corresponding to the proportionate alleged loss or\n\ndamage, the appellant(s) filed O.A.Nos.246 and 247 of 2020 before this\n\nCourt. This Court granted an interim order on 06.07.2020. Even before the\n\norder passed by this Court was communicated, the Bank Guarantee was\n\ninvoked in respect UAA-05. In respect of UAA-01, the amount was not\n\npaid to the first respondent-CMRL by the Bank.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_75\">      57. The Bank Guarantees were invoked on the ground that several\n\noutstanding works left unattended and therefore, only a Partial Taking Over\n\nCertificate was issued on 09.02.2019 in UAA-1 contract, with a list of\n\nbalance works and snags. So far as UAA-05 contract is concerned, the\n\nTaking Over Certificate was issued on 27.08.2018, effective from\n\n15.07.2018 and on     issuance of Taking Over Certificate, it was reduced\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">Page No.57/69</span>\n\f                                                 O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nfrom 7.5% to 2.5%, and the same is valid only up to 26.08.2020. But\n\naccording to the appellant(s), the Bank Guarantees are not independent\n\ncontracts and their invocation is subject to certain conditions. The\n\ninvocation of Bank Guarantees depend on the underlying contract. Under\n\nsuch circumstances, as per Clause 4.2 of the GCC, the first respondent-\n\nCMRL ought to have notified the defects to the appellant(s) prior to\n\ninvoking the Bank Guarantee, which has not been done in this case. But it\n\nis contended by the first respondent-CMRL that they have notified the\n\ndefects through various correspondences.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">      58. Therefore, if it is an independent contract, irrespective of the\n\ndefects and shortcomings in execution of the work by the appellant(s), the\n\nfirst respondent-CMRL is entitled to invoke the Bank Guarantee. If it is not,\n\nthe invocation of the Bank Guarantee depends upon the clauses contained in\n\nthe underlying contract. But it should be borne in mind that the appli\n\ncation was filed under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n\nseeking interim protection pending the arbitration proceedings.        In the\n\ninstant case, the project was completed and it was put to public use. This is\n\nnot a case as though the appellant(s) had abandoned the project or intended\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_69\">Page No.58/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nto rock the boat and made the first respondent-CMRL to complete the works\n\nleft by the appellant by engaging another contractor. On the other hand, it is\n\nthe case of the first respondent-CMRL that, though the appellant completed\n\nthe work, there are some left over works and the same has to be completed\n\nby engaging a third party. But this was disputed by the appellant(s) by\n\nstating that they were always ready to complete the minor outstanding\n\nworks pointed out by the first respondent-CMRL and they are not shirking\n\ntheir responsibility from doing so. Further, the appellant(s) contended that,\n\ndefects, if any, observed, will be rectified by them during the performance\n\nperiod as per the contract. Thus, the appellant(s) disputed the claim of the\n\nfirst respondent-CMRL with respect to the loss said to have suffered by\n\nthem. Therefore, we are of the opinion that the alleged loss is yet to be\n\ndetermined. One of the conditions for invocation of the Bank Guarantee is\n\nthat the first respondent ought to have suffered determinable loss and\n\nproportionate to such loss quantified, the Bank Guarantee has to be invoked.\n\nFurther, before invoking the Bank Guarantee, the appellant must be put on\n\nnotice regarding the extent of loss or damage suffered by the first\n\nrespondent and the necessity to invoke the Bank Guarantee furnished by the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">Page No.59/69</span>\n\f                                                 O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nappellant. Further, whatever the amount of Bank Guarantee furnished by\n\nthe appellant(s) cannot be invoked by the first respondent-CMRL, but the\n\ninvocation must be to the extent of damage or proportionate to the loss\n\nincurred by the first respondent-CMRL. Thus, before invoking the Bank\n\nGuarantee, the appellant(s) must be put on notice. Even though there are\n\nseveral correspondences emanated and exchanged between the parties, in all\n\nthose correspondences, the first respondent-CMRL had only pointed out the\n\ndefects or short comings, which the appellant(s) is/are always ready and\n\nwilling to rectify. In none of those correspondences, it has been specified\n\nby the first respondent-CMRL about the loss incurred by them by reason of\n\nthe poor workmanship or material used during the course of contract.\n\nFurther, in none of those correspondences, the first respondent-CMRL has\n\nquantified the damages or loss suffered by them. In fact, in the letter dated\n\n06.07.2020 addressed to the appellant(s) by CMRL, it was only stated as\n\nunder:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">             &quot;Sub : Design and construction of underground stations\n      at Washermanpet, Mannadi, High Court, Chennai Central &amp;\n      Egmore and Associated Tunnels - Contract No. UAA-01\n      Contract UAA 01- Default of contractor - Notice under GCC\n      4.2 reg\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">Page No.60/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\n\n      Ref :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">      1.

Further, in the letter dated 06.07.2020 addressed to The Manager,\n\nIDBI Bank Limited, Mumbai, it was only stated by the first respondent-\n\nCMRL that &quot;As per the terms of the Bank Guarantee, CMRL requests you to\n\nencash the aforementioned Bank Guarantee and treat this as Firm Demand\n\nfrom CMRL and credit the proceeds to CMRL&#x27;s Bank Account as per the\n\ndetails given hereunder.&quot; Thus, the entire Bank Guarantee offered by the\n\nappellant(s) was sought to be encashed by the first respondent-CMRL\n\nwithout specifying the quantum of amount proportionate to the extent of\n\ndamages or loss incurred by the first respondent. In such circumstances, we\n\nare not in agreement with the findings of the learned Single Judge that it is\n\nalways open to the appellant(s) to recover the differential amount from the\n\nfirst respondent-CMRL. In the absence of quantifying the extent of loss or\n\ndamage said to have suffered by the first respondent-CMRL, the proposed\n\naction of the first respondent-CMRL to encash the entire BG amount\n\noffered by the appellant, is liable to be interfered with. Therefore, we hold\n\nthat the appellant(s) is/are entitled for injunction restraining the first\n\nrespondent-CMRL from invoking the Bank Guarantee especially when the\n\ncontract has been completed and Taking Over Certificate has also been\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">Page No.62/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nissued by first respondent and the project has been put to public use.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">      60. Though it is the submission of the first respondent-CMRL that\n\nTaking Over Certificate is not for having completed the work in full, but\n\nonly a partial Taking Over Certificate had been given, in our opinion, this\n\ncan be dealt with only by the Arbitrator by adducing evidence as to whether\n\nthe entire work has been completed or what was the extent of work actually\n\ncompleted, whether such completion of work is partial or full. This cannot\n\nbe gone into by us in these appeals. In this regard, it is appropriate to place\n\nreliance on the decision of this Court reported in Radhakrishnan\n\nRaghavan Nair       vs. M/s. Consul Consolidated Private Limited and\n\nothers reported in (2015) 3 Law Weekly 882, wherein, it was held that,\n\nwhen the loss said to have suffered by the first respondent therein, has not\n\nyet determined and when it is disputed by the appellant therein, then the\n\ninvocation or enforcement of Bank Guarantee is not proper. Therefore, in\n\nthe case on hand, it is appropriate to issue a direction to keep the Bank\n\nGuarantee(s) alive and direct the parties to work out their remedy before the\n\nArbitrator, who shall determine all the disputes or liability of the parties,\n\nincluding as to whether the invocation of Bank Guarantee is proper or not.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">Page No.63/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_83\">      61. Mr.Aravindh Pandian, learned Senior Counsel appearing for the\n\nfirst respondent-CMRL submitted that as per <a href=\"/doc/150591478/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 9(2)</a> of the Arbitration\n\nand Conciliation Act, before commencement of the arbitration proceedings,\n\na Court can pass an order, as an interim protection and in such event, the\n\narbitration proceedings has to be commenced within a period of 90 days\n\nfrom the date of such order or within such further time as the Court may\n\ndetermine. In the instant case, interim order of &quot;status-quo&quot; was granted by\n\nthe learned Single Judge on 08.07.2020 and the same continued from time\n\nto time, until the impugned order was passed. Thereafter, on the request of\n\nthe learned counsel for the appellant(s), the learned Single Judge has\n\ninstructed the learned counsel for the respondents to maintain status quo till\n\n21.08.2020. Thereafter, in the appeals, interim order was granted. Even\n\nafter more than 90 days, the arbitration has not been commenced. Therefore,\n\nthe interim order will lapse automatically and the matter cannot be referred\n\nto arbitration.   In Archer Power Systems Private Limited vs. Kohli\n\nVentures Limited and others) reported in 2018 (2) CTC 241, it was held\n\nthat the applicant has to establish that it is manifest to arbitrate by\n\ncommencing arbitration proceedings at the earliest.

But we find that the above proposition of law laid down by the\n\nDivision Bench of this Court deals with territorial jurisdiction of the Court\n\nto entertain an application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 9</a> of the Act. Only a passing\n\nreference was made with regard to non-commencement of the arbitration\n\nproceedings. However, the judgment of Division Bench of Calcultta High\n\nCourt in 2016 SCC Online Cal 6251 (supra), gives a fitting answer to this\n\nissue, wherein it was held that <a href=\"/doc/150591478/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 9 (2)</a> is not mandatory and it is only\n\ndirectory. <a href=\"/doc/150591478/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 9 (2)</a> did not state any consequences due to non-\n\ncompliance of the said provisions. It is a general principle of interpretation\n\nof law and whenever a direction is contained in a section and it is not\n\nfollowed up with consequential penal provision, such direction are to be\n\nconsidered directory and not mandatory notwithstanding the usage of\n\n&quot;shall&quot; before the direction.     <a href=\"/doc/150591478/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 9 (2)</a> provides a rider that if the\n\narbitration proceedings are not commenced within 90 days, it shall be\n\ncommenced within such a period as may be directed by the Court, meaning\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">Page No.65/69</span>\n\f                                                  O.S.A.Nos.173 and 174 of 2020\n\nthereby, the Court specify a time period within which the arbitration\n\nproceedings shall be set in motion. In view of this, we direct the parties to\n\napproach the Arbitrator(s) within a period of 30 days from the date of\n\nreceipt of a copy of this judgment. All the disputes between the parties shall\n\nbe resolved there.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_85\">        63.
