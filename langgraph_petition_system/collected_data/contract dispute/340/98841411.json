While passing the award he has to\n          bear in mind the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/65067/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 28</a> of the Act, which\n                            \n          clearly provides that in case of domestic arbitration in India,\n          the Arbitral Tribunal shall decide the dispute in accordance\n          with substantive law for the time in force in India. If the\n          Arbitrator ignores the substantive law in force in India and\n        \n\n\n          passes an award, it is bound to cause injustice Page 2449 and is\n          liable to be set aside. For example law requires that the claim\n     \n\n\n\n          should be within limitation. If the award is passed on a claim,\n          which is clearly barred by the limitation, that will be against the\n          provisions of law and the award can not be sustained. In the\n\n\n\n\n\n          present case, it is the contention of the petitioner that the\n          learned Arbitrator ignored the terms of the contract, relevant\n          documents as well as the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/679619/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 55</a> of the\n          Contract Act and, therefore, the award is liable to be set aside.\n          It will be necessary to examine the record to find out in the light\n\n\n\n\n\n          of this contention.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">          13.

The contractor himself\n          accepted that very good working period was lost due to the\n          force majeure conditions and this was one of the grounds on\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n          which the time could be extended under the contract and in such\n          circumstances, no compensation could be claimed by the\n          contractor merely because of delay. Admittedly, as per this\n          request, the petitioner extended time.

On this\n                             \n          request, the petitioner extended time by further period of ten\n          months by letter dated 20th September, 1994. Admittedly, the\n          contractor stopped the work on 31st March, 1996. However, on\n                            \n          4th July, 1996 the contractor addressed a letter to the petitioner\n          pointing out the causes of delay and by this letter for the first\n          time, the contractor made a claim of Rs. 3,41,24,558/-on\n          different heads including the loss of profits, overheads,\n       \n\n\n          expenditure on machinery, etc. and thereafter on request of the\n          contractor. The dispute was referred to the Arbitrator. From the\n    \n\n\n\n          above record, it is clear that the contractor sought extension of\n          time twice. First time, he clearly contended that due to the force\n          majeure conditions, work could not be done, while second time\n          he expressed certain difficulties faced and also sought time. In\n\n\n\n\n\n          none of the letters seeking extension of time, the contractor\n          indicated that he would claim compensation for delay as\n          required under <a href=\"/doc/679619/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 55</a> of the Contract Act. He had accepted\n          the extension of time and carried out work upto 31st March,\n          1996 and admittedly, by that time 80% of the work was\n\n\n\n\n\n          completed. It means he had carried on that work and, that too,\n          much beyond the agreed period of the contract without giving\n          any notice or indication that he would work beyond the agreed\n          period of time only if he would be compensated for the delay. As\n          he has not given such indication, he could not claim any\n          compensation on account of delays.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_40\">          14.    The learned Single Judge noted that the petitioner had\n          accepted the findings of the arbitrator that delay was on\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 17/03/2015 21:10:02 :::</span>\n     ppn                                   21                          arbp-275.12 (j).doc\n\n\n          account of petitioner. However, the learned Counsel for the\n          petitioner rightly pointed out that in ground (iv) in the petition,\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                 \n          the petitioner had contended that the arbitrator had failed Page\n          2452 to note the correspondence, which would clearly establish\n\n\n\n\n                                                         \n          that the respondent No. 1, i.e., the contractor was responsible\n          for the delay and was therefore, liable for liquidated damages.\n          The learned Counsel also pointed out that in ground (tt) of the\n          memo appeal the petitioner/appellant have stated that the\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n          learned Single Judge erred in stating that the appellants have\n          not challenged the findings as to delay. We find substance in this\n          contention of the petitioner. The petitioner had consistently\n          taken stand that the delay was caused by the contractor while\n\n\n\n\n                                              \n          the contractor contended that the delay was on account of the\n          petitioner. At least this was raised by the contractor in the\n                             \n          second letter seeking extension of time for completion of work.\n          Taking into consideration the correspondence between the\n          parties, it is difficult to hold that the delay was caused by the\n                            \n          petitioner. At the same time it is also difficult to come to\n          conclusion that the delay was caused by the contractor alone.\n          First letter of the contractor clearly shows that delay was on\n          account of force majeure, which was beyond the control of both\n          the parties. In view of the terms of the contract, the contractor\n       \n\n\n          could not claim any compensation on account of delay, which\n    \n\n\n\n          could not be attributed to the petitioner and particularly he\n          could not claim this compensation when he had carried on the\n          work beyond the period of contract without indicating that he\n          would proceed with the work beyond the period of contract only\n\n\n\n\n\n          if he is compensated for delay. It is material to note that the\n          contractor himself sought extension of time for carrying on the\n          work, therefore, in our considered opinion, the contractor could\n          not claim any compensation on account of loss of profits or loss\n          of overheads due to delays.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">          15.     It is material to note that total cost of the work was Rs.\n          474 lakhs and 80% of the work was admittedly completed for\n          which the payment was also made. Thus, when the work was\n          stopped or abandoned by the contractor, only 20% of the work\n          was remaining and the cost of the 20% work was only Rs.\n          114.80 lakhs. If the contractor would have completed the work,\n          he would be entitled to receive Rs. 114.80 lakhs and according\n          to his own contention and as per the assessment made by the\n          arbitrator, he would be getting 10% on account of overheads\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                         ::: Downloaded on - 17/03/2015 21:10:02 :::</span>\n     ppn                                  22                          arbp-275.12 (j).doc\n\n\n          and 10% on account of profits. Thus, the gain of the contractor\n          would be 20% of the said amount, which would be only Rs.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                                                \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_42\">          22.96 lakhs. Against this the Arbitrator awarded Rs.\n          1,57,37,666/- which is much more than 20% of even the total\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n          contract money and, therefore, it can be said that compensation\n          awarded by the arbitrator was infact arbitrary against the terms\n          of the contract and perverse and, therefore, it may be held that\n          he acted beyond his jurisdiction. It can not be termed as a mere\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n          error within jurisdiction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">          18.      Taking into consideration the terms of the contract,\n          legal provisions and the award passed by the learned Arbitrator,\n          it is clear that the award is clearly against the terms of the\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n          contract, provisions of law and infact, it is perverse and can not\n          stand judicial scrutiny. In our considered opinion, the award is\n                             \n          liable to be set aside. At the same time, we may also note that\n          the petitioner is also not entitled to any counter claim on\n          account of any delays on the part of the contractor as the\n                            \n          petitioner had extended time on request of the contractor and\n          that too without indicating that the petitioner would claim any\n          compensation as required under <a href=\"/doc/679619/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 55</a> of the Contract Act.\n          Though there was provision in terms of the contract for\n        \n\n          liquidated damages, in fact as pointed out above, the petitioner\n          also could not establish that delay was only on account of the\n     \n\n\n\n          contractor. In view of the above, the appeal deserves to be\n          allowed and the impugned judgment and the award are liable to\n          be set aside.&quot;\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_44\">    39.

The\n        \n\n    arbitral tribunal also overlooked the stand of the respondents themselves\n    opposing the counter claim made by the petitioner on the ground that the\n     \n\n\n\n    cause of action was not continuing cause of action. The averments made\n    by the petitioner in paragraph 21 of the counter claim in respect of\n\n\n\n\n\n    limitation was denied by the respondents in toto. The arbitral tribunal, in\n    my view, could not have overlooked and ignored the contentions /\n    submissions made by the respondents themselves on the plea of\n\n\n\n\n\n    limitation. The award shows patent illegality on the face of the award on\n    the issue of limitation and the issue whether the contract was indivisible\n    or not is concerned.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_100\">    83.

Nearly all the\n           machinery was delivered in Bombay more than three years\n           before the institution of the suit, and if it were held that time\n\n\n\n\n\n           ran from delivery at Delhi, there was no evidence on that\n           point.

The term\n          &quot;December shipment, three lots, two months&#x27; grace&quot; does not\n          imply that the contract goods are to be delivered in three\n           \n\n\n          instalments, but merely that they are to be shipped in three\n        \n\n\n\n          lots commencing with December, i.e., the first lot in\n          December the second in January and the third in February\n          allowing two months&#x27; grace.

A number of pleas were taken in the\n\n\n\n\n\n           memorandum of appeal, but it is not necessary to discuss\n           them at any length. On behalf of the appellants it was urged\n           that barring two bales only, the rest of the claim was time\n           barred. The argument is based upon the various due dates as\n           worked out by Mr. Sardha Ram, the learned Counsel for the\n\n\n\n\n\n           defendants-appellants, in the light of a certain memorandum\n           described as statement A which is printed at p. 8 of the\n           supplementary paper book. He says that the December\n           shipment reached Karachi on the 8th April 1917, and that\n           allowing four days for the journey between Karachi and\n           Delhi the date of arrival in Delhi was the 12th April 1917. In\n           the same way, about the January shipment the date of arrival\n           at Delhi according to him would be the 21st May 1917, and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 17/03/2015 21:10:02 :::</span>\n     ppn                               49                          arbp-275.12 (j).doc\n\n\n          as to the February shipment the date of arrival in Delhi\n          would be the 1st May 1917. It is only as regards the March\n\n\n\n\n                                                                             \n          shipment consisting of two bales only which reached Delhi\n          on the 12th September 1917, that, according to Mr. Sardha\n\n\n\n\n                                                     \n          Ram, the claim was within time, since the present suit was\n          brought on the 19th July 1920. It may be mentioned that the\n          statement A deals with Mulls Nos. 35255 only, because\n          Messrs. Ralli Brothers, whose agent prepared the said\n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n          statement A, are the sole importers of Mulls No. 35255 and\n          not of Mulls No. 36556. Mr. Sardha Ram&#x27;s argument on this\n          part of the case is that every date of the arrival of a\n          particular instalment of goods at Delhi constituted the due\n\n\n\n\n                                          \n          date and default on the part of the defendants on such due\n          date gave a separate cause of action to the plaintiffs and as\n                          \n          the plaintiffs brought the present suit more than &#x27;three years\n          after the dates, worked out as above, the suit was time barred\n          in respect of all the instalments with the exception of the two\n                         \n          bales of the March shipment. The point in controversy is not\n          free from difficulty, because the appellants&#x27; contention finds\n          some support from the reasoning contained in two cases at\n          least. Jagmohandas Vurjiwan Das v. Nusserwanji Jehangir\n          was quoted on behalf of the appellants. In this case the\n       \n\n\n          defendants sold to the plaintiffs 1,000 tons of coal, shipment\n    \n\n\n\n          January to May, at the rate of 200 tons monthly.

Even\n    if such claim for refund was considered as a claim under section 55 read\n    with <a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_57\">section 73</a> of the Contract Act, the respondents were liable to prove\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 17/03/2015 21:10:03 :::</span>\n     ppn                                  56                          arbp-275.12 (j).doc\n\n\n    the breach alleged to have been committed by the petitioner and the loss\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                \n    suffered by the respondents in view of such breach committed by the\n    petitioner.

Insofar as submission of Mr.Sen, the learned senior counsel\n    for the respondent that there was no plea raised by the petitioner in this\n     \n\n\n\n    petition or raised before the learned arbitral tribunal that the respondent\n    could not have been allowed to urge across the bar the stand taken on the\n\n\n\n\n\n    plea of limitation is concerned, it is not in dispute that such plea raised by\n    the respondents in the written statement to the counter claim was already\n    on record before the learned arbitral tribunal. In spite of such plea, the\n\n\n\n\n\n    arbitral tribunal permitted the respondents to raise such inconsistent\n    submission across the bar.
