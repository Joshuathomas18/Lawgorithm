During pendency of WPC\n\n   No.1182/16, another writ petition bearing WPC No.347/2019 has\n\n   been filed which is outcome of termination of subject contract\n\n   vide letter dated 14.1.2019.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2. Facts of the case, in nutshell, are that respondent No.2 floated e-\n\n   procurement tender notice No.190/TC/08-09 dated 17.2.2009\n\n   inviting tenders, on lump-sum basis, from &#x27;A-5&#x27; Class registered\n\n   contractors   with   the   Public   Works   Department,   for    the\n\n   construction work of &#x27;HL Bridge and Approach Road across\n\n   Hasdeo River at Geruva Ghat on Korba-Geruva Ghat-Darri\n\n   Road&#x27;.   In pursuance of the said tender notice, the petitioner\n\n   submitted his tender along with requisite documents. When the\n\n   tenders were opened, offer of the petitioner was found to be the\n\n   lowest at Rs.13,23,00,000/- (lumpsum price) for the subject work\n\n   and the petitioner was intimated accordingly vide letter dated\n\n   24.7.2009.    The work order was issued on 28.7.2009 to the\n\n   petitioner to start the work and on the same day an agreement\n\n   was executed between the petitioner and respondent No.2. The\n\n   period of completion of work mentioned in the contract was 18\n\n   months from reckoned date excluding rainy season.               After\n\n   entering into agreement and on account of change in approved\n\n   foundation levels, the petitioner submitted/furnished revised\n\n   &#x27;General Arrangement Drawings (GAD)&#x27; suited for construction of\n\n   Bridge and as per revised GAD, which was approved, and the\n\n   work of construction of Bridge was started. However, considering\n\n   certain contingencies in between, the period of completion of\n\n   work was extended up to 15.1.2012. The respondents issued\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                              4</span>\n\nvarious letters for execution of work of approach roads within\n\nlump-sum price of the subject contract mentioning therein that\n\nconstruction of the approach road is limited to the extent fixed in\n\nspecial condition of the contract. Numbers of letters were\n\nexchanged between the petitioner and respondent authorities\n\nconcerned, which form part of the record of writ petition.\n\nConsidering the delay in finalization of the drawings &amp; designs by\n\nthe department, which caused delay in commencement of the\n\ncontract, the Chief Engineer vide letter dated 10.1.2013 amended\n\nthe date of commencement of tender work as &#x27;26.4.2010&#x27; and\n\ndate of completion as &#x27;25.11.2012. Thereafter the petitioner sent\n\na letter informing the authorities about the completion of subject\n\ntender work in all respects on 30.1.2013 and requested for\n\nissuance of &#x27;work completion certificate&#x27; and settlement of final\n\nbills.   Respondent authority concerned refused to issue &#x27;work\n\ncompletion certificate&#x27; in favour of the petitioner on the ground\n\nthat the petitioner has not constructed the entire approach road\n\nconnecting the Bridge from Korba side and Darri side. On such\n\nobjection being raised, the petitioner replied that the petitioner\n\nhas constructed approach road on each side as per LI drawings,\n\nbut the same was not accepted by respondent No.5 stating that\n\nconstruction of approach road is not in accordance with Annexure\n\n&#x27;M&#x27; &amp; &#x27;N&#x27; to the tender document.      The dispute travelled upto\n\nhighest officer of the department i.e. Secretary/ Engineer-in-\n\nChief, and despite intervention of the Minister In-charge, it could\n\nnot be resolved.     Subsequently, vide letter dated 27.8.2015\n\npermission was sought from the Secretary for termination of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                   5</span>\n\n  contract. With no option left, the petitioner approached this Court\n\n  by filing this writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_3\">3. Shri Chetan Sharma, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner\n\n  submits that looking to some fault found in the GAD prepared by\n\n  the respondents, pre-detailed survey and sub-soil investigation,\n\n  the petitioner submitted revised detailed drawings, which was\n\n  accepted by the respondent Chief Engineer, who communicated\n\n  his approval also to the petitioner vide letter dated 13.4.2010. He\n\n  submits that in the revised GAD also there is mention about\n\n  approach road and length of approach road towards Korba side\n\n  is 49 mtrs and Darri side is 29 mtrs, which was constructed by\n\n  the petitioner. He also submits that construction of bridge has\n\n  already been completed as per revised GAD as also approach\n\n  road as per GAD, but length of approach road, which is now\n\n  being asked for construction i.e. 740 mtrs total towards Korba\n\n  side and 140 mtrs total towards Darri side, is not the part of the\n\n  revised GAD signed between the parties, therefore, the\n\n  respondent authorities are not justified in saying that the tender\n\n  work awarded to the petitioner has not been completed.           He\n\n  referred to Annexure P-6 to the petition to show that approach\n\n  road and its length has been shown specifically in the drawings\n\n  and according to which, length of both sides of approach road is\n\n  49 &amp; 29 mtrs respectively. He submits that therefore the action\n\n  initiated by respondent authorities by sending letters seeking\n\n  permission for terminating petitioner&#x27;s contract is illegal. He also\n\n  referred to Clause 4.28 and submits that as per the condition,\n\n  only WBM/WMM work is required to be carried out as per\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                6</span>\n\nspecification.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">      He further submits that both the parties have already made\n\nsubmissions before the Minister concerned and thereafter before\n\nthe Honorary Advisor by placing all relevant documents in\n\nsupport of their respective stand and it has been held by the\n\nAdvisor that the contractor has constructed the agreed length of\n\napproach road and there is no question of imposition of penalty\n\non him. It is also contended that as the authority was appointed\n\nwith the consent of the parties, who dealt with the issue and\n\ndecided the same, therefore, there cannot be any dispute inter-se\n\nbetween the parties.       It is submitted that there should be\n\ntransparency in the action of the State. Once the respondent\n\nauthorities participated and accepted the process, then defiance\n\nfrom the outcome of the said process is arbitrary and illegal.\n\nRespondent No.2 to 5 in utter disregard of the orders passed by\n\nthe Competent Authority had approached the Minister concerned\n\nmentioning different reasons and on 27.9.2013 the Minister\n\nconcerned opined in favour of the petitioner which is sufficient to\n\nshow that there is no dispute which is liable for adjudication,\n\nmaking action of withholding of completion certificate or seeking\n\ntermination of contract under Clause 1.1.4 of the condition of\n\nContact to be illegal and arbitrary.      The noting made by the\n\nMinister concerned in the note sheet is required to be complied\n\nwith being binding in nature over the respondent authorities. On\n\nthe basis of aforementioned submissions, learned Senior\n\nCounsel for the petitioner submits that the petitioner is entitled for\n\nall the reliefs as claimed in the writ petition. It is also argued that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                 7</span>\n\n  looking to the nature of dispute raised in the petition, the\n\n  arbitration clause, as mentioned in the conditions of contract, will\n\n  not be attracted because the dispute is not with regard to money\n\n  claim but only with respect to the length of approach road.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"18862049\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"46458903\" id=\"span_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1441083\" id=\"span_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1318432\" id=\"span_9\">In support of above contention, learned Senior Counsel\n\n  places his reliance on the judgements delivered in the matter of\n\n  <a href=\"/doc/1318432/\" id=\"a_1\">Rai Sahib Ram Jawaya Kapur &amp; ors v.

Per contra, Shri Alok Bakshi, learned Additional Advocate\n\n  General for the respondent State submits that the award of\n\n  contract for construction of bridge and approach road is not in\n\n  dispute. Even it is admitted by the petitioner that approach road is\n\n  required to be constructed. He submits that the petitioner cannot\n\n  go beyond the agreement.          The GAD, as submitted by the\n\n  petitioner, is only revised drawings &amp; designs of the &#x27;bridge&#x27; and\n\n  not for the whole tender work. Scope of work is well mentioned\n\n  in Clause 2.23 of the condition of contract and the lump-sum cost\n\n  of the work is given in Annexure &#x27;M&#x27; &amp; &#x27;N&#x27;.    Annexure-M clearly\n\n  mentions the length &amp; width of the bridge as also the length of\n\n  approach road i.e. total 880 mtrs (740 mtrs towards Korba side &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                               8</span>\n\n140 mtrs towards Darri side). Width of approach road is\n\nmentioned as 8.40 mtrs. He also submits that the same length of\n\napproach road has also been mentioned for both the sides of\n\nbridge and scope of work which is agreed by the petitioner and\n\nalso conditions of the contract are inclusive of Annexure &#x27;M&#x27; &amp; &#x27;N&#x27;.\n\nHe submits that at this stage the petitioner cannot be permitted to\n\nsay that approach road is restricted as per revised GAD only. He\n\nsubmits that revised GAD is with respect to drawings of bridge\n\nbecause    while    spot   inspection   and    considering    other\n\nspecifications of spot where the bridge was to be constructed, the\n\ndrawings &amp; designs of the bridge was proposed to be revised by\n\nthe petitioner on his furnishing proposed design of the bridge, the\n\nsame was accepted. The technical flaw is with respect to the\n\ndesign of the bridge, mainly with regard to piers and its depth etc.\n\nonly.   Revised drawings &amp; designs is not for construction of\n\napproach road but it is with respect to bridge only. Other\n\nconditions as prescribed in Annexure &#x27;M&#x27; &amp;&#x27;N&#x27;, which are details of\n\nlength of bridge and its specifications along with length of\n\napproach road, has not been revised or changed at any point of\n\ntime. He submits that the side plan referred is a view of work site\n\nwhich contains both bridge and approach road. He also submits\n\nthat revised drawing was approved subject to Clause No.3.29 of\n\nthe tender conditions which provides for extra work and rebate.\n\nHe also submits that the petitioner preferred an appeal against\n\nthe order of Superintending Engineer as per Clause 1.17 of the\n\nconditions of tender before the Chief Engineer. Accordingly, on\n\n22.1.2013 the Chief Engineer decided and rejected the claim so\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                               9</span>\n\nfar as it relates to approach road.        He also submits that\n\ncontention of the petitioner that claim or dispute, as raised by the\n\npetitioner, does not involve any financial claim and therefore it\n\ncannot be referred for arbitration under Clause 1.17, is also not\n\ncorrect in view of specific words used in Clause 1.17 of the\n\ntender conditions. He submits that in view of the order passed by\n\nthis Court on 4.4.2017, the Chief Secretary looked into the matter\n\nand after considering the claim of both the sides, had concluded\n\nthat the action on the part of the respondent authorities in issuing\n\nnotice for termination of contract on account of non-completion of\n\nsubject tender work, is not erroneous. Eighty Percent of the total\n\ncontract value was for construction of bridge and twenty percent\n\nwas for construction of approach road. By the said bifurcation of\n\namount of tender value itself it is clear that 20% of total value of\n\nwork i.e. Rs.2,64,60,000/-, cannot be said to be value for\n\nconstruction of only 100 mtrs road.     Clause 3.2 of the tender\n\ncondition, which relates to &#x27;drawings&#x27; mentions that drawings and\n\nspecifications are to be considered as complementary to each\n\nother and anything appearing in one which is not described in\n\nother, no advantage shall be taken of such omission and\n\ntherefore the petitioner cannot be permitted to take a plea that\n\nunder the revised GAD the length of approach road is only about\n\n30 mt on each side.      Even otherwise revised GAD is for the\n\nbridge only and with regard to approach road for bridge other\n\nspecifications are to be considered.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">      He further submits that since beginning the petitioner was\n\nwell aware about the nature and volume of work and thereafter\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                   10</span>\n\n   only they entered into contract for construction of bridge and\n\n   approach road as per terms mentioned in the tender conditions.\n\n   He submits that noting made in the note sheet by the Minister\n\n   concerned    is   not    binding    and   conclusive   unless   it   is\n\n   communicated to the petitioner. There is no communication of\n\n   the noting made by the Minister concerned to the petitioner at\n\n   any point of time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">          Reliance is placed on the judgements rendered in State of\n\n   UP vs. Bridge &amp; Roof (India) Ltd. reported in (1996) 6 SCC 22;\n\n   State of Bihar v.

In reply, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner submits that\n\n   the Competent Authority has not been defined in the tender\n\n   document.    The Committee consisting of five members, has\n\n   decided the complaint made by the petitioner and the said\n\n   Committee has been defined as &#x27;Competent Authority&#x27; under the\n\n   contract. He submits that the Minister or Honorary Advisor has\n\n   held the termination of contract not warranted. He submits that\n\n   the word &#x27;dispute&#x27; is defined under Section 2 (1) (d) of the\n\n   Chhattisgarh Madhyastham Adhiniyam, 1993 which envisages\n\n   that &#x27;dispute&#x27; means claim of ascertained money valued at\n\n   Rs.50,000/- or more, whereas the dispute raised by the petitioner\n\n   is not a money claim but it is with respect to construction of\n\n   approach road.       It is submitted that contract is with regard to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                  11</span>\n\n   construction of bridge only and not for approach road.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">6. We have heard learned counsel for the parties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">7. Facts emerging from the arguments advanced by learned\n\n   counsel for respective parties are that present lis filed before this\n\n   Court by petitioner is only with respect to length of approach road\n\n   on both sides of the bridge. The tender work is governed by the\n\n   terms and conditions incorporated in the tender document and\n\n   also agreement entered into between the parties. Clauses of the\n\n   terms and conditions of tender, which appear to be relevant in the\n\n   facts and circumstances of present case are Clause 2.22, 2.23,\n\n   3.24, 4.21, 4.28 and the same are reproduced below;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        &quot;2.22:   The contractor shall execute the work as per\n        detailed specifications as incorporated in the tender\n        document and in accordance with the approved drawing\n        and special conditions incorporated in the tender\n        documents.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        2.23: Scope of work covered by lump-sum cost: The\n        scope of work covered by the lump-sum cost is given is\n        Annexure- M and N.\n        3.24: Scope of Lumpsum cost: The lumpsum contract\n        shall comprise of the construction, completion and\n        maintenance of the works and provision of all labour,\n        materials, constructional plants, transport and all works\n        of a temporary or permanent nature required for such\n        construction, completion and maintenance in so far as\n        the necessary for providing the same is specified in the\n        contract.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        4.21 Lay out of the bridge: Before commencement of\n        the work, the contractor shall obtain the correct site,\n        centre line or the bridge and location of the abutments\n        and piers from the Engineer-in-Charge of the work. The\n        control pillars shall be fixed at each end of the bridge\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                   12</span>\n\n        about 15 meters away from the location of the\n        abutments or end piers. The top of Reference pillars\n        shall be at a suitable level (so that the centre line of all\n        piers could be checked) and its size shall be adequate\n        (width about 1/3 of the height). The centre line of the\n        bridge and the formation level shall be in inscribed on a\n        concrete copping over the reference pillars.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">        4.28: Approaches work and approach slab: Lumpsum\n        cost shall include the work of suitably designed filter\n        medial as per clause 2503/309.3.3(b) of M.O.S.T.\n        Specifications behind abutment and return in full length\n        and height above natural ground level. Lumpsum cost\n        shall also include the cost of construction of the\n        approach road mentioned in the General Arrangement\n        Drawing. The work for earth work &amp; WBM/WMM shall\n        also be carried out as per the specifications mentioned\n        in annexure M. The earth work up to bottom of dirt wall\n        shall be done before laying last span on abutment and\n        adjoining support. RCC approach slab will be done by\n        the contractor, the cost of which will be included in the\n        lumpsum offer.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">8. So far as the submission made by learned Senior Counsel for the\n\n   petitioner that nature and volume of work has to be considered\n\n   on the basis of revised GAD only when the said GAD has been\n\n   approved and signed by the Competent Authority, is concerned,\n\n   looking to the nature of dispute/question raised by learned\n\n   counsel for the parties &#x27;whether the revised GAD will only prevail\n\n   and have its effect for total tender work which is to be executed\n\n   by the contractor or the construction work as mentioned in the\n\n   tender   document      will   be    the   revised   GAD   plus   other\n\n   specifications, as mentioned in Annexure &#x27;M&#x27; &amp; &#x27;N&#x27; of the tender\n\n   document, is a question for consideration.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                 13</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">9. Submission of learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner that as\n\n   soon as revised GAD has been presented by him and the same\n\n   was accepted by the authorities, the construction work of bridge\n\n   is restricted to the revised GAD and the drawings forming part of\n\n   LI drawing. The petitioner has made several correspondences\n\n   with the respondent authorities concerned, which are part &amp;\n\n   parcel of the petition, and the respondent authorities concerned\n\n   have also written several letters to the petitioner including the\n\n   dispute of construction of approach road on both sides of the\n\n   bridge i.e. Korba and Darri side.    Issue raised by the petitioner\n\n   has been considered by the authorities i.e. by Superintending\n\n   Engineer under Clause 1.17 and by Chief Engineer in an appeal,\n\n   and it also travelled up to the office of Minister In-charge on more\n\n   than one occasion and the Minister had made some noting in the\n\n   concerned file. One Honorary Advisor was also appointed in the\n\n   matter but the opinion given by the said Advisor in favour of\n\n   petitioner was not accepted by the department. In the year 2017,\n\n   on the direction of this Court the Chief Secretary of the\n\n   Department has considered the issue and arrived at a conclusion\n\n   that the work, as mentioned in the tender, has not been\n\n   completed. In view of the sequence of events taken place, as\n\n   mentioned above, the dispute projected in the petition appears to\n\n   be factual one which can only be decided by way of evidence.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">10. We do not find force in the submission of learned Senior Counsel\n\n   for the petitioner that the noting made by the Minister concerned\n\n   in favour of the petitioner, being an order, is binding on the\n\n   respondent authorities for the reason that the said noting is inter-\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                               14</span>\n\ndepartmental    noting    and      the   same   has   never   been\n\ncommunicated to the petitioner and therefore it could be looked\n\nas an internal deliberation only.        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18862049\" id=\"span_17\">In <a href=\"/doc/18862049/\" id=\"a_5\">Pimpri Chinchwad New\n\nTownship Development Authority</a> (supra) the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\nCourt has held that mere noting in the files of the Government\n\ndealing with any matter pertaining to any person is essentially an\n\ninternal matter of the Government and carries with it no legal\n\nsanctity.

It merely represents\n           expression of opinion by the particular individual. By\n           no stretch of imagination, such noting can be treated\n           as a decision of the Government. Even if the\n           competent authority records its opinion in the file on\n           the merits of the matter under consideration, the\n           same cannot be termed as a decision of the\n           Government unless it is sanctified and acted upon by\n           issuing an order in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/313937/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 77(1)</a> and\n           <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_14\">(2)</a> or <a href=\"/doc/1838225/\" id=\"a_15\">Article 166(1)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_16\">(2).</a> The noting in the file or\n           even a decision gets culminated into an order\n           affecting right of the parties only when it is expressed\n           in the name of the President or the Governor, as the\n           case may be, and authenticated in the manner\n           provided in <a href=\"/doc/1085831/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 77(2)</a> or <a href=\"/doc/500615/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 166(2).</a> A noting or\n           even a decision recorded in the file can always be\n           reviewed/reversed/overruled or overturned and the\n           court cannot take cognizance of the earlier noting or\n           decision for exercise of the power of judicial review.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">11. In the matter of Bachhittar Singh&#x27;s (supra) Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\n  Court has observed as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">       &quot;9. The question, therefore, is whether he did in fact\n       make such an order. Merely writing something on the file\n       does not amount to an order. Before something amounts\n       to an order of the State Government two things are\n       necessary. The order has to be expressed in the name of\n       the Governor as required by cl. (1) of <a href=\"/doc/358020/\" id=\"a_19\">Art. 166</a> and then it\n       has to be communicated. As already indicated, no formal\n       order modifying the decision of the Revenue Secretary\n       was ever made. Until such an order is drawn up the\n       State Government cannot, in our opinion, be regarded as\n       bound by what was stated in the file. As along as the\n       matter rested with him the Revenue Minister could well\n       score out his remarks or minutes on the file and write\n       fresh ones.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">       11. The business of State is a complicated one and has\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                          16</span>\n\nnecessarily to be conducted through the agency of a\nlarge    number    of   officials   and   authorities.   The\nconstitution, therefore, requires and so did the Rules of\nBusiness framed by the Rajpramukh of PEPSU provide,\nthat the action must be taken by the authority concerned\nin the name of the Raj- pramukh. It is not till this formality\nis observed that the action can be regarded as that of\nthe State or here, by the Rajpramukh. We may further\nobserve that, constitutionally speaking, the Minister is no\nmore than an adviser and that the head of the State, the\nGovernor or Rajpramukh,1 is to act with the aid and\nadvice of his Council of Ministers. Therefore, until such\nadvice is accepted by the Governor whatever the\nMinister or the Council of Ministers may say in regard to\na particular matter does not become the action of the\nState until the advice of the Council of Ministers is\naccepted or deemed to be accepted by the Head of the\nState. Indeed, it is possible that after expressing one\nopinion about a particular matter at a particular stage a\nMinister or the Council of Ministers may express quite a\ndifferent opinion, one which may be completely opposed\nto the earlier opinion. Which of them can be regarded as\nthe &quot;order&#x27; of the State Government? Therefore to make\nthe opinion amount to a decision of the Government it\nmust be communicated to the person concerned. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1910029\" id=\"span_26\">In this\nconnection we may quote the following from the\njudgment of this Court in the <a href=\"/doc/1910029/\" id=\"a_20\">State of Punjab v. Sodhi\nSukhdev Singh2</a>.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">        &quot;Mr. Gopal Singh attempted to argue that\n        before the final order was passed the Council\n        *Till the abolition of that office by the\n        Amendment of the Constitution in 1956. of\n        Ministers had decided to accept the respon-\n        dent&#x27;s representation and to reinstate him, and\n        that, according to him, the respondent seeks to\n        prove by calling the two original orders. We are\n        unable to understand this argument. Even if the\n        Council of Ministers had provisionally decided\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                    17</span>\n\n               to reinstate the respondent that would not\n               prevent the Council from reconsidering the\n               matter and coming to a contrary conclusion\n               later on, until a final decision is reached by\n               them and is communicated to the Rajpramukh\n               in the form of advice and acted upon by him by\n               issuing an order in that behalf to the\n               respondent.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_21\">        Thus it is of the essence that the order has to be\n        communicated to the person who would be affected by\n        that order before the State and that person can be bound\n        by that order. For, until the order is communicated to the\n        person affected by it, it would be open to the Council of\n        Ministers to consider the matter over and over again\n        and, therefore, till its communication the order cannot be\n        regarded as anything more than provisional in character.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">        11.We are, therefore, of the opinion that the remarks or\n        the order of the Revenue Minister, PEPSU are of no\n        avail to the appellant.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">12. It is not disputed by learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner\n\n   that the noting made in the files by the Minister of the Department\n\n   was not communicated to the petitioner. In fact, learned counsel\n\n   submitted that the fact of noting made in file in favour of petitioner\n\n   came to petitioner&#x27;s knowledge only when he received papers/\n\n   copies of file under the <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_21\">Right to Information Act, 2005</a>. In view of\n\n   submission made by the learned counsel for the respective\n\n   parties and also in the light of the verdicts of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n\n   Court on the issue, the noting made by the Minister cannot be\n\n   said to be an order passed by the Minister in favour of any of the\n\n   parties, but it is only an inter-departmental proceedings and the\n\n   petitioner cannot be benefited, in any manner, from the same.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">13. Other argument advanced by learned Senior Counsel for the\n\n   petitioner is that issue has been considered and decided by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                 18</span>\n\n   Honorary Advisor to the Government in favour of the petitioner.\n\n   The opinion given by the said Advisor will not have any binding\n\n   effect for the reason that he is not an authority under any\n\n   procedure prescribed for redressal of the dispute.         Affidavit\n\n   submitted by the Chief Secretary in pursuance of the direction\n\n   issued by this Court on 4.4.2017, mentions in very specific term\n\n   that the subject tender work has not been completed as per\n\n   terms and conditions of tender document.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">14. Subsequently, vide letter dated 14.1.2019 the subject contract\n\n   itself was terminated by respondent No.5 and earnest money &amp;\n\n   security deposit were forfeited.    The petitioner was also held\n\n   liable for payment of compensation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">15. From the pleadings and documents placed on record by both the\n\n   parties, it appears to this Court that the objection raised by the\n\n   petitioner that total length of approach road on both sides is 49\n\n   mtrs &amp; 29 mtrs respectively, has been referred to the authority\n\n   concerned and at the first instance it was decided against the\n\n   petitioner and the appeal preferred by petitioner before the Chief\n\n   Engineer was also decided against him. Thereafter on more than\n\n   one occasion the file was sent to the office of the In-charge\n\n   Minister and thereafter the matter was referred for opinion of the\n\n   Honorary Advisor of the State and lastly the Chief Secretary filed\n\n   an affidavit before this Court that the work awarded to the\n\n   petitioner is incomplete, clearly reveals that the dispute projected\n\n   is a factual one which can be decided only on placing evidence\n\n   by the respective parties. Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the matter of\n\n   Bridge &amp; Roof Company (India) Ltd.&#x27;s case (supra) has held that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                              19</span>\n\ndispute relating to interpretation of terms of contract cannot be\n\nagitated in a writ petition. Relevant paragraphs of the said\n\njudgment are reproduced below;-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">       &quot;15. In our opinion,the very remedy adopted by the\n       respondent is misconceived. It is not entitled to any\n       relief in these proceedings,i.e,in the writ petition filed\n       by it. The High court appears to be right in not\n       pronouncing upon any of the several contentions\n       raised in the writ petition by both the parties and in\n       merely reiteration the effect of the order of the Deputy\n       commissioner made under the proviso to section 8-D\n       (1).\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">       16. Firstly, the contract between the parties is a\n       contract in the realm of private law. It is governed by\n       the provisions of the contract Act or may be,also by\n       certain provisions of the sale of Goods Act. Any\n       dispute relating to interpretation of the terms and\n       conditions of such a contract cannot be agitated, and\n       could not have been agitated,in a writ petition. That is\n       a matter either for arbitration as provided by the\n       contract of for Civil court as the case may be. whether\n       any amount is due to the respondent from the\n       appellant-Government       under   the   contract   and,if\n       so,how much and the further question whether\n       retention or refusal to pay any amount by the\n       Government is justified, or not are all matters which\n       cannot be agitated in or adjudicated upon in a writ\n       petition. The prayer in the writ petition,viz.,to restrain\n       the Government from deducting particular amount from\n       the writ petitioner&#x27;s bill(s) was not a prayer which could\n       be granted by the High court under Article 226.Indeed,\n       the High Court has not granted the said prayer.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">       21. There is yet another substantial reason for not\n       entertaining the writ petition. The contract in question\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                 20</span>\n\n          contains a clause providing inter alia for settlement of\n          disputes by reference to arbitration [Clause 67 of the\n          Contract]. The Arbitrators can decide both questions of\n          fact as well as questions of law. When the contract\n          itself provides for a mode of settlement of disputes\n          arising from the contract, there is no reason why the\n          parties should not follow and adopt that remedy and\n          invoke the extra-ordinary jurisdiction of the High Court\n          under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 226.</a> Tree existence of an effective\n          alternative remedy - in this case, provided in the\n          contract itself - is a good ground for the court to\n          decline to exercise its extra-ordinary jurisdiction under\n          <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 226.</a> The said Article wag not meant to supplant\n          the existing remedies at law but only to supplement\n          them in certain well-recognised situations. As pointed\n          out above, the prayer for issuance of a writ of\n          mandamus wastes wholly misconceived in this case\n          since the respondent was not seeking to enforce any\n          statutory right of theirs nor was it seeking to enforce\n          any statutory obligation cast upon the appellants.\n          Indeed, the very resort to <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 226</a> whether for\n          issuance of mandamus or any other writ, order or\n          direction   -   was   misconceived    for   the   reasons\n          mentioned supra.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_28\">16. Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in yet another matter i.e. Jain Plastics &amp;\n   Chemicals Ltd.&#x27;s case (supra) has held that writ is not the remedy\n   for enforcing contractual obligations and when an alternative and\n   equally efficacious remedy is open to the litigant, he should be\n   required to pursue that remedy and not invoke the writ jurisdiction\n   of the High Court. Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court further held that the\n   existence of alternative remedy does not affect the jurisdiction of\n   the court to issue writ, but ordinarily that would be a good ground\n   in refusing to exercise the discretion under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 226.</a>   Hon&#x27;ble\n   Supreme Court also held in Para-7 thus;-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">       &quot;7.In our view, it is apparent that the order passed by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                 21</span>\n\n       the High Court is on the face of it illegal and erroneous.\n       It is true that many matters could be decided after\n       referring to the contentions raised in the affidavits and\n       counter-affidavits, but that would hardly be ground for\n       exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 226</a>\n       of the Constitution in case of alleged breach of\n       contract. Whether the alleged non-supply of road\n       permits by the appellants would justify breach of\n       contract by the respondent would depend upon facts\n       and evidence and is not required to be decided or dealt\n       with in a writ petition. Such seriously disputed\n       questions or rival claims of the parties with regard to\n       breach of contract are to be investigated and\n       determined on the basis of evidence which may be led\n       by the parties in an properly instituted civil suit rather\n       than by a Court exercising prerogative of issuing writs.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">17. In the aforementioned verdicts, Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court has held\n\n   that contract between the parties are in the realm of private law.\n\n   The Arbitrator or Civil Court will be the appropriate forum for\n\n   deciding the dispute, if any, raised by any of the parties. <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_27\">Article\n\n   226</a> of the Constitution of India is not meant to supplement the\n\n   existing remedies available under contract i.e. clause of\n\n   arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_30\">18. Submission made by learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner\n\n   that as the petitioner&#x27;s claim is not a monetary claim, the\n\n   question/dispute raised by the petitioner will not come within the\n\n   purview of Clause 1.17 of the tender conditions is not sustainable\n\n   because Clause 1.17 is very wide enough to cover all disputes\n\n   arising out of the contract. Relevant portion of Clause 1.17 is\n\n   extracted below for ready reference;-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                  22</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_31\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">         &quot;1.17.Arbitration Clause: Except as otherwise provided\n         in this contract all question and dispute, relating to the\n         meaning of the specifications designs, drawings and\n         instructions herein before mentioned and as to thing\n         whatsoever, in any way, arising out of or relating to the\n         contract, designs, drawings, specifications, estimates,\n         concerning the works, or the execution or failure to\n         execute the same, whether arising during the progress of\n         the works or after the completion abandonment thereof\n         shall be referred to the superintending Engineer shall\n         give his written instructions and/or decisions within a\n         period of 60 days of such request.

First part of Clause 1.17 specifically provides that dispute relating\n\n   to the contract, designs, drawings, specifications, estimates\n\n   concerning the works etc. The dispute which has been projected\n\n   by the petitioner clearly deals with the term &#x27;specifications,\n\n   concerning the works&#x27; and therefore the petitioner is having\n\n   alternative and efficacious remedy to approach the competent\n\n   forum, as provided under Clause1.17 of the conditions of\n\n   contract, for redressal of his grievances and further the petitioner\n\n   is also claiming payment of his final bill of Rs.3,35,79,977/-. Even\n\n   otherwise, as per submission of learned Senior Counsel for the\n\n   petitioner, the dispute is only in respect of construction of\n\n   approach road, which is directly related to money. If the work, as\n\n   agreed, is not completed by the contractor, the contract will have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                             23</span>\n\n              consequences of non-payment of the entire amount of contract\n\n              and also make him liable for penalty and other consequences, if\n\n              any.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">           20. For the foregoing reasons and in view of the above cited rulings\n\n              of Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court governing the issue with regard to\n\n              dealing of contractual dispute and also the nature of dispute\n\n              projected by the petitioner and denied by the respondents, we\n\n              are of the view that instant case involves factual dispute which\n\n              cannot be decided in a writ proceeding merely on the basis of\n\n              pleadings of the respective parties but it could only be decided on\n\n              the basis of evidence to be adduced by the respective parties\n\n              before the competent forum.        Hence, we are not inclined to\n\n              entertain this writ petition and exercise discretionary jurisdiction\n\n              under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">           21. The writ petitions fail. They are accordingly dismissed.
