Gopala Gowda, J.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">        The appellant has  filed  these  appeals  being  aggrieved  by  the\n  impugned common judgment and decree dated 12th June, 2003  passed  in  RFA\n  nos. 593-600/2000 by the High Court of Karnataka urging  various  relevant\n  facts and legal grounds for setting  aside  the  same  and  restoring  the\n  common judgment and decrees dated 30th November, 1999 passed in  O.S.  no.\n  35/97 to 42/97 by the Civil Judge (Senior Division) Gadag.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">  2.  The brief facts are stated hereunder for  the  purpose  of  the  rival\n  factual and legal contentions that are urged by  the  learned  counsel  on\n  behalf of the  parties.For  the  sake  of  convenience,  the  parties  are\n  referred to in this judgment as per the ranking assigned to  them  in  the\n  plaints before the trial court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">        The plaintiff, the appellant herein, is a Class  I  contractor.   He\n  undertakes the contract of construction of  irrigation  canals  and  other\n  major works on a large scale. The plaintiff has constructed an  irrigation\n  dam across the Malaprabha river near Soundatti in Belgaum  District.   The\n  water from the said reservoir is to be supplied to agricultural  lands  of\n  the farmers in  Dharwad  and  Belgaum  Districts,  through  canals  to  be\n  excavated and constructed for that purpose.  For the construction of  such\n  canals in Ron taluka in Dharwad District, a Division is established at Ron\n  headed by an  Executive  Engineer.  A  Chief  Engineer  was  appointed  to\n  supervise work whose office was established at Belgaum.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">  3.  The plaintiff submitted  his  tenders  upon  an  invitation  from  the\n  defendants, the respondents herein, for execution of the balance  work  of\n  canals and his offer of bid was accepted.  He has  deposited  the  earnest\n  money in the form of bank guarantee.   On accepting the bid amount offered\n  by the plaintiff, parties entered into a contract for  execution  of  Alur\n  combined branch and work of canal at K.M. no.1-6 and Malaprabha right bank\n  canal works K.M. 97 and 102,  as  per  the  terms  and  conditions  agreed\n  between them and more particularly as stipulated in the tender notice.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">  4.   Accordingly,  the  defendant  no.4,  Executive  Engineer,  Irrigation\n  Department issued work orders to the plaintiff relating to various  canals\n  on 9.11.1988, 10.3.1989 and 16.3.1989 respectively. As per clause 2 of the\n  agreement, the execution of work was to be completed within a period of 15\n  months from the date of handing over the site to the  plaintiff  excluding\n  the monsoon season from 15th June to 15th September of the relevant years.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">  5.  It is the case of the plaintiff that he was able to complete his  part\n  of the work such as canal excavation, embankment, morum lining/casing etc.\n  within a short period deploying his staff and machinery. Upon progress  of\n  execution of work, the plaintiff wrote several  letters  dated  25.5.1990,\n  8.6.1990, 10.6.1990, 27.3.1991, 9.5.1991 and 14.10.1992 (Exs. P-45,  P-32,\n  P-46, P-30, P-42 and P-19) addressed to defendant no. 4 requesting him  to\n  supply cement, RCC templates and PCC slabs for putting them to the bed  of\n  canal and for other uses.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">  6.  It is the further case of the plaintiff that as per the meeting  which\n  was held between the plaintiff and defendant no.4, the  proceedings  which\n  are marked as Ex. P-20, revealed that the cement and cement materials were\n  in stock and were available with defendant  no.4,  but  he  had  purposely\n  delayed the supply of cement and cement materials  and  he  also  did  not\n  authorize the plaintiff to procure cement from the open  market  and  made\n  certain false accusations against him.  The plaintiff placed reliance upon\n  clause 30 of the tender agreement wherein it is stated that  the  decision\n  of the Chief Engineer in relation to the dispute is final.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">  7.   It is the case of the plaintiff that despite  repeated  requests  and\n  demands made by him vide his letters referred to supra, the defendant no.4\n  failed to supply cement and cement materials required by the plaintiff  to\n  complete the work, therefore  he  had  no  option  but  to  terminate  the\n  contract with the defendants.  The plaintiff  vide  his  aforesaid  letter\n  dated 9.5.1991 to defendant no.4, marked as Ex. P-42,  asked  to  finalise\n  the bill regarding the execution of work  by  him  and  to  terminate  the\n  contracts without imposing any penalty.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">  8.     It is the further case of the plaintiff that  on  12.10.1994,  vide\n  Ex.D-41, defendant no.3 passed an order rescinding the contract and levied\n  penalty on the plaintiff, which order was communicated to the plaintiff by\n  defendant no.4 vide letter dated 24.10.1994  marked  as  Ex.D-42.   Before\n  rescinding the contract, defendant no.3 neither issued  notice  nor  heard\n  the plaintiff, as required under clause 3(d) of the agreement, though  the\n  contract is rescinded by invoking clause 3(d) of the agreement by him.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">  9.    The plaintiff, being aggrieved by the rescinding of the contract and\n  failure on the part of the defendants to make payments for the  work  done\n  and return of earnest money  and  security  deposit  amount,  filed  eight\n  original suit nos. 35 to 42 of 1997  against  the  defendants  before  the\n  Civil Judge (Senior Division)  Gadag  seeking  for  grant  of  declaratory\n  relief that the order of rescinding the contract passed by defendant no. 3\n  in respect of works of canal is illegal and not binding on him.   Further,\n  the plaintiff sought  decrees  of  permanent  injunction  restraining  the\n  defendants from either forfeiting  or  adjusting  the  earnest  money  and\n  security deposit amount made by him and for  payment  of  bill  amount  in\n  respect of the work executed by him and also to  restrain  the  defendants\n  from recovering the alleged risk and cost amount from him from out of  the\n  amount due from the works  executed  by  him  in  any  other  Division  or\n  Department (Exs. P-1 to P-6  produced  in  the  Original  Suits)  of  Alur\n  combined branch and work of canal at K.M. no. 97 and  102  and  Malaprabha\n  right bank canal.  He had further prayed  for  settlement  of  final  bill\n  amount in relation to the execution of work and return  of  earnest  money\n  and security deposit amount along  with  18%  interest  and  also  on  the\n  withheld amount along with damages, costs and other reliefs.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">  10. Defendant no. 4 filed written statement opposing the prayers  made  in\n  the original suits and denied various allegations  made  in  the  plaints,\n  except admitting the execution of the  contract  with  the  plaintiff  for\n  execution of the canal work to complete the balance work  of  construction\n  of the canal in relation to the project in Dharwad district.   The same is\n  adopted by defendant nos. 1 to 3 accepting the execution of  the  contract\n  with the plaintiff.   It  is  further  admitted  by  defendant  no.4  that\n  plaintiff has done some work and the defendant’s Department was to  supply\n  cement after the  raw  materials,  i.e.  metal,  sand  etc.  required  was\n  collected for bed concrete and slab lining, but the  excavated  canal  was\n  not trimmed and dressed to the required section.  Therefore, the defendant\n  no. 4 was not bound to supply cement and cement  materials,  in  fact  the\n  plaintiff was even requested to make his own  arrangements  for  procuring\n  cement from the open market  as  per  para  7   of  Schedule  &#x27;A&#x27;  of  the\n  agreement.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">  11.  It is further pleaded in the written  statement  that  the  plaintiff\n  without following the terms  and  conditions  of  the  contract,  with  an\n  illegitimate motive, purposely stopped the work and abandoned  it  in  the\n  middle, knowing fully well that the balance work will be completed at  his\n  cost as per the tender clauses and he  requested  to  terminate  the  work\n  without any penalty  to  be  imposed  against  him  as  per  the  contract\n  agreement. Defendant no.4 further pleaded that the plaintiff was at  fault\n  and did not resume the work when he was requested to complete the work  as\n  per the agreement. As such, considering the facts and circumstances of the\n  case, defendant no. 4 was directed to take action against the plaintiff as\n  per the tender conditions of contract work and  accordingly  the  contract\n  was rescinded and he was  informed  of  the  action  taken  by  the  Chief\n  Engineer by imposing maximum penalty upon him and  forfeiture  of  earnest\n  money and security deposit amount.   Defendant  no.4  denied  the  various\n  allegations made by the plaintiff against him and prayed for dismissal  of\n  the suits both on merits as well as on the question of limitation, besides\n  declaratory relief and other reliefs sought for by the plaintiff.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">  12.  The trial court has framed nearly nine issues for its  determination.\n  The suits went for trial. Common evidence is recorded in all the  original\n  suits. The plaintiff examined himself  and  got  marked  73  documents  as\n  exhibits and defendants  examined  eight  witnesses  and  got  marked  136\n  documents in support of their case.   After  hearing  the  arguments,  the\n  learned trial judge decided issue nos. 1 to 5 in  the  affirmative,  issue\n  nos. 6 to 8 in negative and issue no. 9 in the affirmative and  the  suits\n  of the plaintiffs were decreed in part by recording reasons in the  common\n  judgment.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_15\">  13. The correctness of the common judgment of the trial court and  decrees\n  passed in the original suits  of  the  plaintiff  was  challenged  by  the\n  defendants before  the  High  Court  of  Karnataka  urging  various  legal\n  contentions questioning  the  correctness  of  the  findings  and  reasons\n  recorded on the aforesaid contentious issues and requested the High  Court\n  to set aside the impugned common judgment and  decrees  as  the  same  are\n  erroneous and suffer from error in law.   The High Court, after  adverting\n  to  the  relevant  necessary  facts,  formulated  the   points   for   its\n  consideration and answered the  same  in  favour  of  the  defendants  and\n  against the plaintiff by recording its reasons holding that the finding of\n  fact and reasons recorded by the trial court on the contentious issues are\n  vitiated on account of erroneous reasoning for  non-consideration  of  the\n  material evidence on record in  favour  of  the  defendants  and   in  the\n  absence of evidence in favour of the plaintiff, the same are  answered  in\n  affirmative and therefore it has reversed the common judgment and  decrees\n  by allowing the appeals.  The correctness of the same is challenged in all\n  these civil appeals by urging the following questions of law:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        1) Whether the order dated  12.10.1994  passed  by  defendant  no.3\n           rescinding the contract, communicated  by  defendant  no.4  vide\n           letter dated 24.10.1994, is valid and justified in the facts and\n           circumstances of the case?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">        2) Whether the  High  Court  is  justified  in  setting  aside  the\n           judgment and decrees of the trial court  without  giving  cogent\n           reasons?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">        3) Whether the plaintiff is entitled to recover  the  cost  of  the\n           work executed by him in respect of the disputed contract?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">        4) Whether the defendant no.3 is  justified  in  imposing  penalty,\n           forfeiture of earnest money, security  deposit  and  withholding\n           bill amount and the same is in accordance  with  the  terms  and\n           conditions of the contract?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">        5) Whether the High Court is justified in  taking  hyper  technical\n           view in the regular first appeals without justification?\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">  14. It is contended by Mr. Kirti S. Javali, the learned counsel on  behalf\n  of the plaintiff that the impugned judgment passed by the  High  Court  is\n  unwarranted and uncalled for as it has  ignored  the  admissible  evidence\n  adduced on record by the plaintiff which is accepted by the learned  trial\n  judge on proper appreciation of pleadings and evidence  and  has  accorded\n  the reliefs as prayed for in the original suits  by  assigning  valid  and\n  cogent reasons on the contentious issues framed by him. The High Court has\n  ignored  the  evidence  adduced  by  the  plaintiff  and  the  defendants,\n  particularly, the DWs 1 to 6  and  8,  whose  evidence  unimpeachably  and\n  conclusively proves the case of the unilateral breach of contract  by  the\n  defendants besides that they have acted most irresponsibly as a result  of\n  which it was impossible for the plaintiff to complete the  contract  work.\n  Further, it is urged that  the  High  Court  has  completely  ignored  the\n  admission made by the witnesses of the defendants, wherein  the  plaintiff\n  also adduced positive evidence to show that the defendants  had  committed\n  breach of contract. Therefore,  it  is  urged  that  the  High  Court  has\n  committed an error of jurisdiction and the impugned judgment is liable  to\n  be set aside.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">  15. It is further contended that the High Court has failed to consider the\n  important and admitted fact that the  defendants,  after  the  earth  work\n  excavated by the plaintiff, were required to supply cement, RCC  templates\n  and PCC slabs for putting them to bed of canal and for other use.   It  is\n  also admitted by the defendants that the  cement  was  in  stock  and  the\n  plaintiff was not informed to procure the same from the open market  after\n  obtaining due permission and further it is also an admitted fact that  the\n  defendants never informed the plaintiff that there was  no  stock  of  the\n  said materials  much  less  supplying  the  same  as  and  when  required.\n  Further, it is contended that it is evident from the facts pleaded and the\n  evidence on record that the defendants are guilty of  breach  of  contract\n  without any fault of the plaintiff and they forfeited  the  earnest  money\n  and security deposits.   Therefore, the findings and reasons  recorded  on\n  the contentious points by the High Court  in  the  impugned  judgment  are\n  contrary to the  legal  evidence  on  record.  Hence,  the  said  findings\n  recorded on contentious points framed by the High Court are  erroneous  in\n  law and the same are liable to be set aside.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">  16.       Further, it is submitted that  the  High  Court  has  failed  to\n  consider the findings and reasons recorded in paras 16,17,18  and  18A  of\n  the trial court judgment.  However, it has accepted the excuses  given  by\n  the defendants that the plaintiff should not have demanded  cement  before\n  collecting sand and metal.  In this regard, the High Court has ignored the\n  pleadings and evidence placed on record with regard to collecting the sand\n  and metal for execution of work.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">  17. It is further submitted that it was nothing but high handedness on the\n  part of the defendants that they have not only caused undue harassment  to\n  the plaintiff but also caused great loss to him by  committing  breach  of\n  the terms and conditions of the contract.  Further,  the  High  Court  has\n  failed to consider the evidence of the defendants who have  supported  the\n  claim of the plaintiff which is referred to in para 19 of the judgment  of\n  the trial court.   Further, the High Court erred  in  re-appreciating  the\n  evidence elicited  from  the  defendants’  witnesses  during  their  cross\n  examination, wherein they have admitted that plaintiff has carried out all\n  the earth work as per specifications. When he demanded cement  and  cement\n  materials from defendant no.4 for execution of further work, the same were\n  not supplied to him.  Therefore,  it  is  very  clear  that  in  spite  of\n  repeated demands made by the plaintiff, cement and cement  materials  were\n  not supplied to him by defendant no. 4.  Therefore,  the  impugned  common\n  judgment of the High Court is contrary to the facts and legal evidence  on\n  record.   Hence, the same is not sustainable in the  eye  of  law  and  is\n  liable to be set aside.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">   18.      Further, it is contended by Mr. Kirit  S.  Javali,  the  learned\n   counsel for the plaintiff that the High Court has  failed  to  appreciate\n   the evidence of defence witnesses who themselves have admitted  in  their\n   evidence that as they did not supply cement  and  cement  materials,  the\n   gradation test also could not be carried out.  The plea that  since  sand\n   and metal were not collected by the plaintiff and defendant no. 4 did not\n   supply cement and cement materials by giving lame excuses  and  therefore\n   the same could not have been accepted by the High Court  to  reverse  the\n   finding of fact recorded by the trial court on the contentious issues  in\n   favour of the plaintiff. The High Court has accepted the grounds  pleaded\n   by the defendants in their appeals, that, the plaintiff did not construct\n   any shed or make provision for storing the cement at the  work  site  and\n   this stand was taken up by them for the first time only at  the  time  of\n   adducing evidence and there is  no  pleading  to  this  effect  in  their\n   written statement. Further, the ground of appeals urged by them  is  that\n   the evidence of DW 8 with regard to non supply of  cement  was  that  the\n   plaintiff did  not  submit  the  construction  programme  to  enable  the\n   defendants  to  supply  the  required  quantity  of  cement  and   cement\n   materials, this evidence is without there being  any  pleading   in  this\n   regard, and further, he has stated that  the  defendants   also  did  not\n   supply cement as the plaintiff had not trimmed  the  canal  and  had  not\n   collected  the sand and metal for conducting gradation test.   Therefore,\n   it is contended by the learned counsel on behalf of  the  plaintiff  that\n   the common judgment and order of the High Court is contrary to the  facts\n   and evidence on record.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_21\">  19.    Ms. Hetu Arora Sethi, the learned counsel appearing on  behalf  of\n  the defendants in these appeals has sought to justify  the  findings  and\n  reasons recorded on the contentious points answered  by  the  High  Court\n  contending that the High Court being the appellate authority, the appeals\n  being in continuation of original proceedings, has reappraised  the  oral\n  and documentary evidence and  found  fault  with  the  findings  of  fact\n  recorded by the trial court on the contentious issues framed  by  it  and\n  the same are erroneous and therefore must be set aside.   It  is  further\n  contended  that  the  plaintiff  has  not   fulfilled   his   contractual\n  obligations as he has not executed the contract work and  therefore,  the\n  Chief Engineer has rightly rescinded the contract and levied the  penalty\n  and forfeited earnest money and security deposit amount and withheld  the\n  final bill amount and therefore, the impugned judgment in  these  appeals\n  at the instance of the plaintiff need not  be  interfered  with  by  this\n  Court  in  exercise  of  its  jurisdiction  under  <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_1\">Article  136</a>  of   the\n  Constitution.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">  20.   It was further  contended  on  behalf  of  the  plaintiff  that  the\n  defendants had not  even  informed  the  plaintiff  the  reasons  for  not\n  supplying the cement and cement materials, the High Court  has  failed  to\n  take into consideration the evidence of  the  defendants  witnesses,  with\n  regard to the meeting held on 23.3.1992 in the Chambers of Chief Engineer,\n  Belgaum, the proceedings of the  meeting  are  marked  as  ex.  P-20,  the\n  plaintiff, defendant no. 4 and  other  officers  of  the  Department  were\n  present in the said meeting, and the work of construction of canal  for  8\n  kms. was discussed  and  it  was  found  that  the  defendant  no.  4  had\n  purposely delayed the supply of  cement  to  the  plaintiff  on  untenable\n  grounds.  Further, DW1, the Executive Engineer, admitted in  his  evidence\n  that on the basis of proceedings drawn in the  Chief  Engineer&#x27;s  chambers\n  that departmental action was also proposed against defendant no. 4 and the\n  subsequent action proposed against him would support the contention of the\n  plaintiff that it is due to the fault of the Department, more particularly\n  of the defendant no. 4, the contract work had to be stopped in the  middle\n  by the plaintiff.    The Ex. P-20  puts  blame  on  defendant  no.  4  for\n  stoppage of work by the plaintiff.  Even in the  letter  dated  11.12.1992\n  issued by the Government of Karnataka, marked as Ex. P-23, it is  observed\n  that the concerned Executive Engineer has come in the way of  contract  by\n  not supplying the cement in time to the plaintiff and the  action  of  the\n  Executive Engineer in terminating two  contracts  is  not  approved.   The\n  aforesaid important aspects of the matter has not been considered  by  the\n  High Court in reversing the judgment of the trial  court  by  passing  the\n  impugned judgment and it is contrary to the facts and evidence on  record.\n  Therefore, the same is liable to be set aside and the judgment and decrees\n  of the trial court are to be restored.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">  21.  It was further contended that the High Court has failed to appreciate\n  that the defendants were not supplying cement free of cost but for charges\n  which were to be deducted from the  final  bill  of  the  plaintiff.   The\n  plaintiff had requested defendant no.4 for the supply of cement and it was\n  for him to decide as to how he  could  have  stored  the  cement  or  made\n  provision for the same.  Further, the High Court should have noticed  that\n  non-completion of the work by the plaintiff is due to non supply of cement\n  by defendant no. 4 and, he also did not supply even the templates and lugs\n  required for putting bed concrete in the excavated canal.   The High Court\n  further should have noticed that  the  defendants  have  not  adduced  any\n  evidence to show that there was no stock of cement which was  required  to\n  be supplied in terms of the contract to the plaintiff.    The  High  Court\n  ought to have considered the entire evidence on record  particularly  that\n  the plaintiff is not at fault  for  non-completion  of  work  as  per  the\n  contract.  Therefore, the impugned judgment and order is contrary  to  the\n  facts and legal evidence on record.  Hence, the same is liable to  be  set\n  aside.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">  22.  With reference to the aforesaid rival factual and legal contentions,\n  the  following points would arise for our consideration:-\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">     1.

Answers to point nos. 1 and 2 :  The  first  and  second  points  are\n  answered together, as they are interrelated, in favour of  the  plaintiff\n  by assigning the following reasons:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">         We have carefully  perused  the  pleadings  and   evidence  of  the\n  parties on record and considered the rival factual and legal  submissions\n  made on their behalf and the findings recorded by the trial court in  its\n  judgment on the contentious issue nos. 1 to 3 and 6 and point nos. 1  and\n  2 by the High Court to answer the aforesaid points.  The trial  court  in\n  its judgment while answering the  contentious issues nos. 1 to 5  in  the\n  affirmative and issue nos. 6 to 8  in  the  negative  in  favour  of  the\n  plaintiff, has elaborately referred to  the  pleadings  and  evidence  on\n  record, particularly the evidence elicited from the defendants’ witnesses\n  by the plaintiff&#x27;s counsel in the cross examination, viz. from DW  1  the\n  Executive Engineer, MRBC Ron, DW 2 the retired Executive  Engineer,  MRBC\n  Division no.5 Sub  division  no.18  in  Mallapur,   DW  4  the  Assistant\n  Executive Engineer, MRBC, Division no.5, Sub-division no.18, Mallapur and\n  DW 5 the Assistant Engineer,  MRBC, Division no.  5,  Sub-division  no.18\n  Mallapur, and also referred  to  the  documentary  evidence,  namely  the\n  letters correspondence made by the plaintiff with the Executive  Engineer\n  Defendant no.4  requesting him to supply the cement and cement  materials\n  for the purpose of  execution of the work as agreed upon in the contract.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">  The learned trial  judge  has  recorded  the  findings  of  fact  on  the\n  contentious issue nos.  1  &amp;  2  in  the  affirmative  holding  that  the\n  plaintiff has proved that defendant no.4 did not supply cement and cement\n  articles for completion of the  work  though  he  had  requested  him  on\n  several occasions by his letters, which are marked as Exs. P-30, P-32, P-\n  41, P-42, P-45 and P- 46 referred to  supra  and  also  referred  to  the\n  admission made in the cross examination of the defendant witnesses namely\n  DWs 1, 2, 4 and 5. The trial court has  rightly  further  held  that  the\n  plaintiff had proved the fact that due to non supply of cement and cement\n  materials by the defendant no.4 as  agreed  upon  in  the  contract,  the\n  progress of the work could not be carried out by him and therefore it was\n  held that he was not at fault for non completion of the agreed work.  The\n  findings of fact recorded by the learned trial  judge  on  the  aforesaid\n  contentious  issues  are  in  the  affirmative  after  referring  to  the\n  pleadings and evidence of the plaintiff and defence  witnesses  and  also\n  considering the submissions made by the learned counsel on behalf of  the\n  plaintiff, that there is no condition in the tender agreement to  collect\n  the sand and metal before making a demand for the supply  of  cement  and\n  cement materials from defendant  no.4.    It  was  further  held  by  the\n  learned trial judge  that  according  to  the  case  of  the  defendants,\n  collection of the sand and metals is required  for  conducting  gradation\n  test, and even to carry out such a gradation test cement is required  and\n  it is an undisputed fact that the defendant no.4 has neither supplied nor\n  authorized the plaintiff to procure the cement and cement materials  from\n  the open market and on account of non supply of the  same  the  plaintiff\n  had to keep his men and machinery idle for  months  together,  which  has\n  resulted in heavy losses for him and after informing the defendant  no.4,\n  the plaintiff had moved  his  men  and  machinery  from  the  work  site.\n  Further, the proceedings held in the meeting on 23.3.1992 in the  Chamber\n  of the Chief Engineer, Belgaum, which document is marked as exhibit  P-20\n  has been referred to by the learned trial judge wherein  it  is  observed\n  that due to injudicious act of defendant no.4 in not supplying cement and\n  cement materials to the plaintiff, the contract work had to be stopped by\n  him and further departmental action was also proposed against him for his\n  inaction in supplying the cement and cement materials to  the  plaintiff.\n  Therefore, learned trial judge has rightly arrived at the  conclusion  on\n  facts and evidence on record and recorded the findings of fact  and  held\n  that the plaintiff has  proved  that  the  contract  work  could  not  be\n  completed due to the fault of the Department itself and its officer  i.e.\n  the defendant no.4,  and the plaintiff cannot  be  blamed.   The  learned\n  trial judge has also considered legal submission made on  behalf  of  the\n  defendants that the plaintiff did not seek permission from the  defendant\n  no.4 for procuring cement from the open market and the further contention\n  urged on behalf of the defendants was that delay in taking possession  of\n  the work site shows that plaintiff had no real  intention  of  completing\n  the work within the time limit and the trial court has  rightly  rejected\n  the same by recording valid reasons.  The plaintiff had  demanded  supply\n  of cement for the entire 8 k.ms. of work,  which comes to about 22 to  23\n  thousand bags of cement but he had not made  any  provision  for  storing\n  such cement and the same perishes faster than sand and metal. He had  not\n  even collected sand and metal required for conducting gradation test. The\n  further contention that in spite of the request made by defendant no.4 to\n  the plaintiff to resume the work  and  complete  the  same,  he  had  not\n  completed the work,  though  he  knew  fully  well  the  consequences  of\n  abandoning work in the middle without any reasonable cause  would  entail\n  serious civil  consequences  and  therefore,  the  fault  lies  with  the\n  plaintiff  and  not  with  the  defendants.   The  above   said   factual\n  submissions made by the learned counsel on behalf of the defendants  were\n  examined by the trial judge with reference to the pleadings and  evidence\n  on record and the same were rightly answered against the defendants.  The\n  learned trial judge in his judgment at paragraphs  16,  17,  18  and  18A\n  adverted to the evidence elicited in the cross examination of DWs 1, 2, 3\n  and 4 and recorded the positive finding on the contentious issues nos.  1\n  and 2, in the affirmative. DW 1 has admitted  in  his  cross  examination\n  that there was no condition in the tender agreement to collect  sand  and\n  metal before demanding cement from the Department  and  further  admitted\n  that after completing the earth work, the plaintiff  demanded  cement  by\n  his letter dated 25.5.1990, which is marked as  Ex.  P-  45.  He  further\n  admitted in his cross examination  that the plaintiff had written  letter\n  to the defendant no.4 stating that he would  commence  the  bed  concrete\n  work next week, if 2731 bags of cement is supplied to him.  Such quantity\n  of cement is required for 1 k.m. work and further the  evidence  elicited\n  in his cross examination shows that cement, template and  the  lugs  were\n  not supplied by defendant no.4 to the plaintiff and he could not complete\n  the work. He has  further  admitted  that  defendant  no.4  had  to  give\n  authorization to the plaintiff to procure cement from the open market and\n  since he did not  inform  the  plaintiff  regarding  the  grant  of  such\n  authorization, he could not procure cement from the open market for  want\n  of such authorization. Since the cement, templates and the lugs were  not\n  supplied for all the kilometers of work by defendant no.4, the  plaintiff\n  could not complete the work.  The plaintiff had also written a letter  to\n  defendant no.4 to conclude the contract for the reason that he could  not\n  finish the same for non supply  of  cement,  template  and  lugs.   DW  1\n  further admitted in his cross examination that they were not required  to\n  supply cement free of charge to the plaintiff but  the  defendants  would\n  deduct the cost of cement in the bill  amount  payable  to  him.  It  was\n  further admitted in his cross examination that defendant no.4  asked  the\n  plaintiff to resume the work, as stated  in the evidence of DW 1, as  the\n  labour charges and material charges were already increased and therefore,\n  the plaintiff did not agree for resuming the work for executing the  same\n  at old rates.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_27\">  24.       Further, the evidence elicited by the plaintiff&#x27;s  counsel  from\n  DW 2, the retired Executive Engineer, is extensively referred  to  by  the\n  learned trial judge in his judgment wherein he has  stated  that  for  bed\n  concrete, trimming work fixing templates and lugs, cement is required.  He\n  further admitted in his evidence that for  execution  of  the  above  said\n  works mixing of cement, sand and metal, gradation test was to be conducted\n  to ascertain their proportion and if, the defendants  do  not  supply  the\n  cement, gradation test cannot be conducted.  He also further admitted that\n  the defendants did not inform the  plaintiff  that  they  have  sufficient\n  stock of cement and he could collect sand and metal for execution of work.\n  The Department did not supply cement and the plaintiff  had  informed  the\n  superior officers of the Department stating that the work  is  halted  for\n  non supply of cement and further stated in his evidence to the effect that\n  if mud mixes with sand and metal, it cannot be used  without  washing  and\n  for such washing more expenses will have to be incurred by the  plaintiff.\n  Further, he had admitted in his cross examination that  authorization  was\n  required for the plaintiff to procure cement from open market.  DW-4  also\n  has deposed to the same effect, which supports the case of the plaintiff.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">  25.       DW-4, the Asstt. Executive Engineer in MRBC,  Division  5,  Sub-\n  division no.18, DW-5 who was  working  as  Asstt.  Engineer  in  the  same\n  Division and DW-7 who was working as Jr. Engineer at the relevant point of\n  time of work have also admitted in their cross examination that  they  did\n  not ask the plaintiff to procure cement from the open market and in  spite\n  of repeated requests made by the plaintiff, the defendant no.  4  did  not\n  supply the cement.  DW-8, the then Executive Engineer also admitted in his\n  cross examination that though plaintiff had  written  several  letters  to\n  defendant no.4 for supply of cement, the Department did not supply  cement\n  and he had admitted that due to non supply of cement, the plaintiff had to\n  stop the work and  due  to  stoppage  of  work  the  plaintiff&#x27;s  men  and\n  machineries had to suffer loss on that count.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">  26.        After  adverting  to  the  evidence  elicited  in   the   cross\n  examination of the aforesaid  defendant  witnesses  the  trial  judge  has\n  analyzed  and  appreciated  the  same  properly  and  came  to  the  right\n  conclusion and recorded the findings of fact at paragraph 18 of the  trial\n  court judgment on the contentious issue nos. 1 to 3  in  the  affirmative.\n  Further, the defence taken by the defendants at the time of  adducing  the\n  evidence without pleading in their written statement, regarding non supply\n  of cement, is that  the  plaintiff  had  not  submitted  the  construction\n  programme to them to enable defendant no.4 to supply the required quantity\n  of cement and the cement materials.   The learned trial judge rightly made\n  observation on the relevant issue in his judgment that defendant no.4  was\n  not supposed to supply cement at free of cost to the plaintiff but charges\n  for the same were to be deducted at the time of disbursement of amount  in\n  the final bill.  Therefore, when the request was  made  by  the  plaintiff\n  with defendant no.4 for supply of cement, it was for him  to  see  how  to\n  store cement safely and how to make best use of the same for  the  purpose\n  of completing the contract work.  The trial  judge  further  recorded  the\n  finding of fact and held  that  the  defendants  neither  supplied  cement\n  though it was in stock nor authorized the plaintiff to procure the  cement\n  from the open  market.   Defendant  no.4  did  not  inform  the  plaintiff\n  regarding refusal to supply the cement. It would have made  no  difference\n  to the Department if it had supplied cement earlier or later. The DW 1 has\n  admitted the same in his evidence on the basis of the proceedings recorded\n  in the meeting held on 23.3.1992, which is marked as Ex. P-20. In the said\n  proceedings blame was put on defendant no.4 for stoppage of work  and  the\n  following facts were noticed and recorded:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      “ a)  Instead  of  putting  the  blame  on  the  contractor  for  not\n      collecting sand, jelly etc., the contractor  might  have  allowed  to\n      procure the cement from  the  open  market  as  per  clauses  of  the\n      agreement;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">      b) Cement was available  with  department  when  the  contractor  had\n      placed his demand for cement;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      c) Instead of issuing cement as demanded by the contractor  the  then\n      EE prolonged the issue and had insisted to collect  the  sand,  jelly\n      etc before issue of cement.”\n\n\n  Further, in the letter Ex. P-23 written by the Government of Karnataka to\n  the Chief Engineer it is observed that the concerned  Executive  Engineer\n  has come in the way of the plaintiff to execute the contract work for non\n  supply of cement in time to him and the proposed  action  of  terminating\n  two contracts is not approved by it.   Therefore, the learned trial judge\n  after adverting to the oral evidence of the defendant witnesses  referred\n  to supra and the documentary evidence Ex. P-20 and  Ex.  P-23  and  other\n  documentary evidence, has rightly arrived at the conclusion on facts  and\n  held that the plaintiff could not complete the work due to non supply  of\n  cement and cement materials by defendant no.4 and he also did not  supply\n  templates and lugs required for putting bed  concrete  in  the  excavated\n  canal. The  plaintiff  had  requested  the  defendants  to  conclude  his\n  contract and return the earnest money, security deposit and other amounts\n  withheld  by  them.   Reference  was  also  made   to  the  letter  dated\n  13.1.1993, marked as Ex. P-21 of the defendant no.4, asking the plaintiff\n  to continue the contract work and furnish his clear consent regarding the\n  same. The plaintiff did not accept the same for the reason that  his  men\n  and machinery were moved from the work site and the contract has come  to\n  an  end.   Therefore,  learned  trial  judge  has  rightly  answered  the\n  contentious issue  nos.  1  and  2  in  the  affirmative.  The  same  was\n  erroneously set aside by the High Court by recording its findings on fact\n  without proper analysis and re-appreciation of  evidence  on  record  and\n  wrongly applied the terms and conditions of  the  contract  to  the  fact\n  situation of the case in hand and accepted the case of the defendants and\n   has set aside the findings in the relevant issues without  noticing  the\n  fact that it is the defendants, who had committed breach of contract  and\n  therefore the plaintiff could not complete  the  agreed  work  under  the\n  contract.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\"> 27.   The findings of fact recorded by the  learned  trial  judge  in  his\n judgment have been reversed by the High Court, ignoring the pleadings  and\n legal evidence on record and therefore we have to hold that  the  findings\n of the High Court are erroneous.   We have very  carefully  examined  that\n portion of the impugned judgment to answer the point nos. 1 and  2  framed\n by us in these appeals for our consideration.  The learned Division  Bench\n of the High Court has adverted to the relevant clause 11 at para 15 of its\n judgment regarding supply of  materials  to  the  plaintiff  that  may  be\n required from time to time to be used by him for the purpose of  execution\n of works as agreed in the contract and  clause  11(A)(i),  which  provides\n that the contractor  shall  see  that  only  the  required  quantities  of\n materials are indented with the Junior Engineer of the Department and  the\n same shall be supplied to him.  The said condition  of  the  agreement  as\n provided in the above clause is not complied with by the plaintiff is  the\n finding recorded by the High Court. As per the said clause, the  plaintiff\n was required to be supplied with cement and cement materials by  defendant\n no. 4,  from time to time on presentation of indents signed by him or  his\n authorized representative and counter signed by the  Department  officers,\n and in this  regard,  the  High  Court  has  referred  to  both  oral  and\n documentary evidence and held that the plaintiff  had  not  presented  any\n indent signed by him or his authorized representative  to  the  Department\n for supply of cement to the Junior Engineer, who in turn sent  it  to  the\n Assistant Executive Engineer by recommending the  same  who  in  turn  was\n required to send it to the Divisional office for supply of the  same.  The\n further finding is that the evidence adduced by  the  defendants  in  this\n regard is unchallenged by the plaintiff and undisputedly,  neither  indent\n nor proof for submitting the same to the defendants is placed  before  the\n Court by the plaintiff to show that he had presented any indent  with  the\n Department for supply of cement and cement materials and  the  High  Court\n has referred to para 18 of the trial court judgment and also to Exs.  P  -\n 31, 37, 45, 59, 65 and 70 the same are marked as  Exs. D- 28, 62, 76, 102,\n 116 and 132 respectively and reversed the findings recorded on  the  above\n contentious issues 1 to 3, 5 and 6 by the trial  court  by  recording  its\n reasons. The correctness of the said findings and reasons are examined  by\n us to find out whether the same is tenable on facts and in  law.  Further,\n the High Court has stated in the impugned judgment by reversing finding of\n fact recorded on the contentious issues referred to  supra  by  the  trial\n court by answering the contentious points  formed  by  it  and  held  that\n nowhere in the said letters it is  mentioned  that  any  indent  had  been\n prepared  or  presented  by  either  the  plaintiff  or   his   authorized\n representative to the defendants in  connection  with  request  to  supply\n cement and other materials to him.  Therefore, it has held that  there  is\n non compliance of the condition  nos.  2.05  and  2.06  of  the  agreement\n referred to above by the plaintiff and further it is not the case  of  the\n plaintiff that in the tender contract he was required to be supplied  with\n cement and cement materials without any  indent  made  as  such.  In  this\n regard, we record our findings as under.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\"> 28.   After the plaintiff took possession of the site  of  the  works  for\n execution of work, he wrote several letters as per  exhibits  referred  to\n supra  with a request to the defendants for supply of  cement  and  cement\n materials and the said letters are very important for the reason that  the\n plaintiff has been persistently demanding defendant  no.4  for  supply  of\n cement and cement materials as agreed to be supplied to him for  execution\n of work.  The aforesaid findings of the High  Court  adverted  to  in  the\n preceding paragraph are erroneous in law for  the  reason  that  the  High\n Court has placed reliance on the evidence of DW-8 regarding non submission\n of indents by the plaintiff as per the terms of the contract  and  general\n conditions of the tender, which evidence is wholly inadmissible in law, as\n the same was allowed to be placed on record by  the  trial  court  without\n pleading in their written statement.  Apart  from  the  said  reason,  the\n defendants in their cross-examination have categorically admitted that the\n cement and cement  materials  were  not  supplied  to  the  plaintiff  for\n execution of work and in fact  in  the  various  letters  written  by  the\n plaintiff marked  as  exhibits  referred  to  supra  he  has  specifically\n demanded for supply  of  cement   and  cement  materials,  the  same  were\n accepted by the defendants but they did not insist the plaintiff to submit\n indents and construction programme and therefore the said letters must  be\n construed as such. Ignoring the substantive evidence on record,  the  High\n Court has reversed the findings of fact on the contentious issues referred\n to supra, which are wholly unsustainable in law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_32\">  29.  In view of the aforesaid  specific  conditions  and  clauses  in  the\n  agreement, the request of the plaintiff  with  the  Department  to  supply\n  cement in entirety within a week, even  in  the  absence  of  indents  the\n  demand of the plaintiff for supply of cement and other  materials  as  per\n  his requirement from time to time to use the  same  in  the  execution  of\n  contract work was very much there by writing number of letters  which  are\n  exhibited and the same was not met  by  the  defendants  by  pleading  and\n  adducing evidence.  The fact remains that defendants have neither supplied\n  the cement and cement materials to  the  plaintiff  as  requested  by  the\n  plaintiff through his series of letters marked  as  exhibits  referred  to\n  supra nor have they replied to him asking him to submit  the  indents.  In\n  view of these admitted facts,  the  High  Court  should  not  have  placed\n  reliance upon the inadmissible evidence of DW 8, to set aside the findings\n  of fact recorded by the trial court on the aforesaid  contentious  issues.\n  Further, para 22  of the impugned judgment refers to the Department asking\n  the plaintiff to furnish the construction  programme  as  contemplated  in\n  general condition no.1.10 of the tender document. This is clear  from  the\n  letters dated 26.6.1990, 28.6.1990 and  30.6.1990  placing  reliance  upon\n  evidence of DW-8 Gangareddy, by the High Court to come to  its  conclusion\n  to reverse the findings of the trial court recorded on  contentious  issue\n  nos. 1 to 3, 5 &amp; 6, as he has stated in his evidence that  as  per  tender\n  agreement, the plaintiff-contractor  should  have  submitted  construction\n  programme for the contract period of 15 months to the defendants,  but  he\n  has not submitted it to them and therefore it has  found  fault  with  the\n  finding of the trial court in holding that  the  defendant  no.4  has  not\n  supplied cement and cement materials to the  plaintiff  for  execution  of\n  work and set aside the same.  It is further erroneously  observed  by  the\n  High Court in the impugned judgment that the  evidence  of  DW-8  remained\n  unchallenged by  the  plaintiff,  as  it  has  accepted  the  inadmissible\n  evidence  regarding  non  submission  of  construction  programme  by  the\n  plaintiff, the said evidence of DW-8 is without pleading of the defendants\n  and therefore it should not have relied upon the  same  and  reversed  the\n  findings of the trial court on the contentious issues.   In  view  of  the\n  foregoing reasons, the High Court’s conclusion and its finding in  holding\n  that the plaintiff had failed to comply with the said  general  conditions\n  of the tender and he committed breach of contract is wholly  untenable  in\n  law. Further, its reference and reliance to clause 44(b) of the  agreement\n  and non supply of the cement and its materials, that the Government  shall\n  not be, in any way, liable on account of  any  delay  in  supply  of  such\n  material also cannot be accepted by this Court in view of the observations\n  made by the Chief Engineer in the proceedings drawn in the meeting held on\n  23.3.1992 which document is marked as  Ex.  P-20.   After  placing  strong\n  reliance upon the said clause for non submission of letter  of  indent  by\n  the plaintiff, though demand has been made as per the letters referred  to\n  supra by the plaintiff, and letters of the defendants referred  to  supra,\n  and that payment of bill  amount  is  being  made  to  the  plaintiff  and\n  therefore the question of concluding contract by defendant no.3  does  not\n  arise.  The defendant no.4 had requested him to bear with the  Department.\n  By the time the letters were written to the plaintiff by defendant no.  4,\n  the plaintiff had already shifted his men and machinery from the site  and\n  accordingly informed the Department about the same.  The  High  Court  has\n  erroneously held that the plaintiff could not have relied  solely  on  the\n  evidence of DW-8 regarding non furnishing of  construction  programme  for\n  supply of cement and cement materials to him  and  he  had  abandoned  the\n  tender work in the middle, and  recorded  its  finding  by  reversing  the\n  finding of the trial court. The said finding of the High  Court  that  the\n  Executive Engineer has stated in his evidence that plaintiff did not  take\n  permission from defendant no.4 to procure cement and  cement  material  as\n  per his evidence is contrary to the terms of the contract.   So  also  the\n  evidence of DWs 3 and 4 in this regard could not have been placed reliance\n  upon by the High Court to set aside the finding of the  trial  court.  For\n  the reasons stated supra and evidence of DWs 2, 3, 4 and 5,  reliance  was\n  placed upon the evidence of  DW-8 by the High Court, as he stated  in  his\n  evidence that the plaintiff did not do canal dressing, trimming  work  and\n  concrete work, which is wholly erroneous as the same is  contrary  to  the\n  terms and conditions of the contract and substantive evidence on record in\n  favour of the plaintiff.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">  30.  Further, the trial court has referred to the evidence of DWs 3, 4, 5,\n  7 and 8 and held that the plaintiff had done canal work  and  canal  bund,\n  murrom lining embankment work, however for the gradation test required  to\n  be done as stated by DW-8,  the same could not  be  done  without  cement,\n  according to the evidence of DWs 2, 3 and 4, as cement was  necessary  for\n  plaintiff to do the bed concrete and trimming work.  The  finding  of  the\n  High Court was that only a certain quantity of cement was required by  the\n  plaintiff but he had requested for supply of  entire  quantity  of  cement\n  from the Department and not the required quantity  for  execution  of  the\n  said works, which were to be attended at that stage of request made by him\n  is once again erroneous in law and cannot be allowed to  sustain  in  law.\n  Further,  it  has  erroneously  observed  that  the  plaintiff   had   not\n  constructed any godown for storing the cement at the work site and he  had\n  not stored sufficient sand and metal, in this regard, the trial court  has\n  placed reliance upon the evidence of DWs.2, 3, 4, 7 and 8 and recorded the\n  finding holding that non supply of cement  and  cement  materials  to  the\n  plaintiff is contrary to the terms and conditions of  the  agreement.  The\n  High Court has found fault with the above findings of the trial  Court  on\n  the contentious issue nos. 1 and 2 and  held  that  the  trial  court  has\n  arrived at erroneous finding, therefore, it has answered the point Nos.  1\n  and 2 framed by it against  the  plaintiff  and  set  aside  the  findings\n  recorded by the trial court on contentious issue  nos.  1  and  2  in  its\n  judgment. Consequently, the first appeals of the defendants were allowed.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">  31.  It is needless to observe that the conclusion and findings arrived at\n  by the High Court on the basis of re-appreciation of evidence is  contrary\n  to the pleadings and evidence on record, the trial judge  being  the  fact\n  finding authority has duly considered the  entire  evidence  after  proper\n  analysis and it has recorded the finding of fact on the contentious  issue\n  nos. 1,2,3,5 and 6 in favour of the plaintiff.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">  32.  Answer to point no.3 - The High Court, on the issue of rescission  of\n  the contract with the  plaintiff  by  defendant  no.3,  vide  order  dated\n  12.10.1994,  which  order  was  communicated  by  defendant  no.4  to  the\n  plaintiff, has relied on letters sent by the defendants to the  plaintiff,\n  wherein he was requested to resume and complete the work and all the items\n  of tender as agreed upon by him. The High Court has  erroneously  recorded\n  the finding of fact stating that no infirmity can be found in  the  action\n  taken by the Department in rescinding the agreement and levying of penalty\n  and forfeiture of earnest money, security deposit and withholding of final\n  bill amount,  as the plaintiff did not resume work nor had  he  shown  his\n  willingness to resume or complete the work as per the terms and conditions\n  of the agreement, nor did he request for any fresh terms and conditions to\n  complete the same, and so the Department was left with no  option  but  to\n  rescind the tender agreement. We find the above findings of the High Court\n  in reversing the finding of the trial court on issue nos. 4, 5 and  7  are\n  wholly untenable both on facts and in law and we have  to  hold  that  the\n  rescinding of the contract by  defendant  no.3  is  illegal,  and  penalty\n  imposed upon the plaintiff  and  forfeiture  of  earnest  money,  security\n  deposit and withholding of bill amount after rescinding  the  contract  is\n  not legal and valid as the plaintiff himself has requested the  defendants\n  to conclude the contract without any penalty or the risk and cost  amount.\n  Defendant no. 3 passed the  order  of  rescinding  the  contract,  without\n  issuing any show cause notice or holding an  enquiry,  as  required  under\n  clause 3(d) of the contract and therefore  the  learned  trial  judge  has\n  rightly recorded the findings  on  the  aforesaid  contentious  issues  in\n  favour of the plaintiff and  rightly  held  that  the  rescinding  of  the\n  contract was not justified. The unilateral rescission of the  contract  of\n  the plaintiff by defendant No. 3 is arbitrary and unreasonable. The action\n  of defendant no.3 in rescinding the contract has resulted in serious civil\n  consequences of imposition of penalty and forfeiture of the earnest  money\n  deposit amount, security  deposit  and  withholding  the  bill  amount  in\n  relation to the  execution  of  the  work  by  the  plaintiff.  Therefore,\n  defendant no. 3 before rescinding the  contract,  by  invoking  his  power\n  under clause  3(d)  of  the  agreement,  should  have  complied  with  the\n  conditions mentioned in the said clause as  the  same  is  mandatory.  The\n  rescinding of the contract is also bad in law for one more reason that the\n  State Government has  accorded permission to  defendant  no.3-  the  Chief\n  Engineer, Irrigation (North), Belgaum to rescind the contract as per terms\n  and conditions  of  the  agreement  vide  letter  dated  29.8.1994,  which\n  document  is  marked  as  Ex.  D-40.  The  Chief  Engineer  directed   the\n  Superintending Engineer, M.R.B.C. Circle,  Dharwad  to  levy  penalty  and\n  rescinded the contract vide letter dated  12.10.1994,  which  document  is\n  marked as Ex. D-41, the relevant portions  of  this  letter  is  extracted\n  below :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">      “(ii) to rescind the contract and to take up the balance work  at  the\n      risk and cost of the contract as per clause-3 of Agreement.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">           In addition to the above, the expenditure incurred  towards  the\n      work charged establishment if any, beyond the tender period  till  the\n      date of rescinding the agreement may be recovered, duly observing  all\n      the formalities of  the  agreement.  The  Superintending  Engineer  is\n      requested to call for tenders for the balance works.”\n\n\n\n\n  We have to infer from the last unnumbered paragraph of  the  said  letter,\n  that the contract of the plaintiff is rescinded.  Thus, we  have  to  hold\n  that defendant no.3 rescinded the contract, which order is communicated by\n  defendant no.4 vide letter 24.10.1994 which document is marked as  Ex.  D-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">  42. The reliance placed by defendant no.3 and the Superintending  Engineer\n  upon the approval of the Government in its letter Ex.D-40  for  rescinding\n  of the contract with the plaintiff is fallacious, as  the  Government  has\n  very clearly stated in its letter referred to supra, that the contract  of\n  the plaintiff has to be rescinded  and  penalty  be  imposed  as  per  the\n  conditions of the agreement. Therefore, the finding recorded by  the  High\n  Court on this contentious point in the impugned judgment is liable  to  be\n  set aside. Accordingly, we set aside the same by answering the point  no.3\n  in favour of the plaintiff.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">  33.   For the foregoing reasons, we are of the view that the findings  and\n  reasons recorded by the High Court on the contentious points framed by  it\n  are totally erroneous both on facts and in law and therefore the same  are\n  required to be interfered with by this Court and hence  the  appeals  must\n  succeed.  In view of the findings and reasons recorded by  this  Court  on\n  point nos. 1,  2  and  3  in  favour  of  the  plaintiff,  point  no.4  is\n  accordingly answered in favour of the plaintiff.  Hence, we set aside  the\n  impugned judgment and decrees dated 12th June, 2003  passed  by  the  High\n  Court of Karnataka in RFA nos. 593-600/2000  and  we  restore  the  common\n  judgment and decrees of the trial court  in  the  original  suits,  except\n  modification with regard to rate of interest from 18% to 9%.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">  34. The defendants are directed to repay the earnest  money  and  security\n  deposit amount and also finalize the bill of the plaintiff  for  the  work\n  executed by the plaintiff and pay the same with interest @  9%  per  annum\n  within six weeks from the date of receipt of the copy  of  this  judgment.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">  Accordingly, the appeals are allowed, with no order as to costs.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">                                                   ……………………………………………………………J.\n                                   [CHANDRAMAULI KR.
