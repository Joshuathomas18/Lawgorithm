After the summons in the suit and notice in the application were\nissued on 30th July, 2020 to the defendant, defendant filed the written\nstatement as also an application under <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 45</a> of the Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996 (in short „the Act‟) to which reply has been filed by\nthe plaintiff and rejoinder thereto by the defendant.\n3.    Case of the plaintiff-Dholi Spintex is that it entered into a contract\nwith the defendant-Louis Dreyfus for supply of 600 Metric Tons of\nAmerican imported raw Cotton in Bales to Dholi Spintex on 30th May, 2019.\nSince the shipment and delivery of the raw Cotton Bales was delayed, Dholi\nSpintex refused to take delivery of the goods. Pursuant to the rejection of the\ngoods by Dholi Spintex in India defendant-Louis Dreyfus initiated\narbitration proceedings against Dholi Spintex before ICA on 29th April, 2020\nunder Clause-6 of the contract.        Dholi Spintex thereafter received a\ncommunication dated 29th April, 2020 from the ICA forwarding the request\nfor appointment of a Technical Arbitrator made by the defendant-Louis\nDreyfus and calling upon Dholi Spintex to appoint its nominee Arbitrator\nwithin 14 days from the receipt of request of arbitration clearly advising that\nthe arbitration under ICA Bylaws is conducted under the English Arbitration\nAct, 1996. Dholi Spintex was unable to respond to ICA‟s mail dated 29th\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                     Page 2 of 60\n                                                                     Signature Not Verified\n                                                                     Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                     MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                     Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                     12:04:34\n April, 2020 due to nationwide lockdown in India. On 2nd June, 2020, Dholi\nSpintex received another letter informing appointment of Mr.David Adcroft\nas an Arbitrator on behalf of Dholi Spintex since it failed to do so within the\nstipulated time stated by ICA. As per the Dholi Spintex, Mr.David Adcroft\nhas given a declaration that he had been employed with one of the group\ncompanies of Louis Dreyfus namely LDCS, Switzerland until June, 2015.\nOn 10th June, 2020 Louis Dreyfus submitted its claim for a sum of\n₹2,44,85,796/-. Dholi Spintex wrote an email to ICA seeking extension of\ntime for taking necessary action on 6th July, 2020 without prejudice to its\ncontentions and submissions to the arbitration, however, in disregard\nthereof, ICA issued an email to the parties dated 9th July, 2020 quoting the\nTribunal‟s communication to the ICA. On 16th July, 2020, Louis Dreyfus\nsubmitted its rejoinder/additional comments as directed by the ICA pursuant\nwhereto, on 20th July, 2020, the ICA issued an email to Dholi Spintex\ndirecting it to reply to Louis Dreyfus‟s comments within 7 days, resulting in\nDholi Spintex seeking the anti-arbitration injunction in the present suit. In\nthe response dated 6th July, 2020 Dholi Spintex objected to the arbitration\non the following grounds:\n      a.     The Contract was executed between two Indian\n             companies in India and was to be performed in India.\n             Therefore, the proper law/ substantive law governing the\n             parties‟ obligations under the Contract can only be Indian\n             law\n      b.     Clauses of 6 and 7 made it clear that by conferring\n             exclusive jurisdiction upon the courts of New Delhi, the\n             parties intended for Indian law to govern the arbitration\n             proceedings\n\n      c.     Bylaw 200 of the ICA Bylaws is opposed to and directly\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                    Page 3 of 60\n                                                                    Signature Not Verified\n                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                    12:04:34\n              contravenes Indian public policy which envisages that\n             Indian parties cannot contract out of Indian law.\n4.    The dispute raised by the plaintiff- Dholi Spintex in the present suit\nrelates to the interpretation of Clauses 6 and 7 of the contract dated 30th\nMay, 2019 between the parties which read as under:-\n      &quot;6. Any dispute arising out of this contract shall be resolved\n      through arbitration in accordance with ICA (International\n      Cotton Association) rules &amp; arbitration procedure. Venue of\n      arbitration shall be London.\n      7.    Only the courts in New Delhi will have jurisdiction.&quot;\n\n5.    Case of the defendant is that it is, inter alia, engaged in trading of\nimported cotton, procures the said cotton from overseas suppliers and sells\nthe same to buyers in India on „High Sea Sales‟ basis. Thus, the ownership\nof the goods is transferred when the items are in transit and not in the\nterritorial waters of India, therefore, outside the territorial jurisdiction of\nIndia. It is the case of the defendant that it entered into a supply contract\nNo. SO/IMP/2018-19/157 with the plaintiff to sell the American cotton and\nconsistent with the practice, the contract was entered into on high sea sales\nbasis. Plaintiff refused to accept the assignment, breached the contract, and\nhas filed the present suit to avoid legal consequences and defendant‟s\ncontractual remedies. The contract between the parties clearly notes that it\nis a high seas sale agreement and the invoices would be high seas sale\ninvoices. Besides clauses 6 and 7 of the contract between the parties as\nnoted above, it is further provided in the contract that goods being sold on\nhigh seas, the recipient shall make its own arrangements for custom and port\nclearance at its own responsibility. Since the plaintiff refused to accept the\ngoods and sought change in the payment of terms on 10th September, 2019, a\n\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                    Page 4 of 60\n                                                                    Signature Not Verified\n                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                    12:04:34\n price revision email was also sent by the defendant. The market price of the\ncotton falling by 13%, the plaintiff was liable to pay the said additional\nmargins as per the contract, industrial practice and law.\n6.    Despite reminder when the plaintiff did not perform its part of the\ncontract, a breach note dated 17th January, 2020 was issued followed by a\ndebit note. However, no payment was received, whereafter on 13th April,\n2020, the defendant invoked the technical arbitration before the ICA and\nappointed its nominee Arbitrator in terms of the arbitration agreement\nbetween the parties.     On 29th April, 2020, ICA wrote to the plaintiff\ninforming it about request for arbitration and asking plaintiff to nominate its\nArbitrator in 14 days. Since the plaintiff failed to nominate its Arbitrator, on\n2nd June, 2020, ICA appointed nominee Arbitrator for the plaintiff being Mr.\nDavid Adcroft. On 11th June, 2020, the defendant filed its claim before the\nICA which was responded by the plaintiff on 6th July, 2020 requesting for 30\ndays for necessary action citing Covid-19 situation. On 16th July, 2020,\ndefendant submitted its reply to the plaintiff‟s jurisdictional objections to the\nArbitral Tribunal and on 20th July, 2020, ICA wrote to the plaintiff to reply\nto/provide additional comments received from the defendant. Instead of\nsubmitting the reply to the Tribunal, the plaintiff instituted the present suit.\nIt is the case of the defendant that international trade in American cotton is\ngenerally conducted under the International Cotton Association (ICA) Rules\nand Procedures, and thus, in the contract dated 30th May, 2019, it was\nagreed that the parties will submit to the arbitration conducted by ICA.\n7.    According to learned counsel for Dholi Spintex, in view of the\narbitration agreement in the contract dated 30th May, 2019, two issues\nrequired to be determined by this Court are:\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                      Page 5 of 60\n                                                                      Signature Not Verified\n                                                                      Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                      MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                      Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                      12:04:34\n      (1)     Whether two Indian parties can choose a foreign system\n             of law as the substantive law of the contract?\n      (2)    Whether the express designation of a court under Clause\n             7 of the Contract providing for exclusive jurisdiction at\n             New Delhi is determinative of the Seat of Arbitration?\n8.    Learned counsel for the Dholi Spintex contends that the impugned\ncontract has been executed between two Indian parties as the plaintiff\ncompany is incorporated in India under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_5\">Companies Act, 1956</a> with its\nregistered office at Ahmadabad, Gujarat and the defendant- Louis Dreyfus is\nalso a company incorporated in India with its registered office in New Delhi.\nThe impugned contract between the parties dated 30 th May, 2019 was\nexecuted in India with performance in India with Dholi Spintex as the buyer\nand Louis Dreyfus as the supplier for sale of 600 MT of American Raw\nCotton. The contract was executed at New Delhi, India. The contract was\nalso required to be performed in India for the reason the American Raw\nCotton was to be delivered by Louis Dreyfus from Mundra Port, India to\nDholi Spintex in Ahmadabad, the payment was to be made in India, an\nadvance payment of ₹75 lakhs was made to Louis Dreyfus in terms of the\ncontract through RTGS from Dholi Spintex‟s bank account to Louis\nDreyfus‟s bank account, both being in India. The delay in delivery of the\ngoods was in India and the goods were rejected in India due to delay. The\ncontract applies INCO Term &quot;CIF CY Mundra&quot; choosing Container Yard\n(CY) at Mundra, Gujarat, India as the place of origin of goods. Though the\ncontract mentions sale on High Seas Sales Basis but the contract is not a\nHigh Seas Sale Agreement nor was any High Seas Sale Agreement entered\ninto between the parties.\n9.    Learned counsel for the Dholi Spintex further states that by virtue of\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                   Page 6 of 60\n                                                                   Signature Not Verified\n                                                                   Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                   MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                   Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                   12:04:34\n the Bylaws 102, 200 and 300 of the International Cotton Association, the\ngoverning law of the contract is the English law mandatorily, the seat of\narbitration had also to be in England and disputes have to be settled\naccording to the law of English and Wales irrespective of domicile,\nresidence or place of business of the parties to the contract.\n10.   It is contended that two Indian parties cannot contract out of Indian\nlaw as the substantive law of their contract, however, in terms of Clause-6 of\nthe contract and the Bylaws of ICA, since the English law would govern the\nsubstantive rights and obligations of two Indian parties entering into a\ncontract which is to be performed in India, the same is clearly impermissible\nand against the very fundamentals of nationality and sovereignty. As per\n<a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act any attempt to exclude the application of\nIndian laws is void. When sale and purchase of commodities is made by\ntwo Indian parties within India, the same should be governed by the laws of\nIndia and the parties cannot choose to exit out of the applicability of the\nIndian laws.\n11.   Referring to the decision reported as 2018 SCC OnLine Del 8842\nUnion of India vs. Vodafone Group PLC, UK, it is contended that the\nSupreme Court in the said decision in a converse situation held that since the\ntwo entities entered into an offshore sale and purchase of shares and not the\nsale of assets which were within India, Vodafone was not liable to pay\nincome tax as per Indian Law. Merely because the plaintiff-Dholi Spintex\nagrees to purchase American raw cotton from Louis Dreyfus, the contract\nbetween two Indian parties cannot be subjected to foreign law. It is not the\nnature of the goods which govern the applicability of the law but the parties\nwho are entering into the contract, where the contract is entered into and\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                   Page 7 of 60\n                                                                   Signature Not Verified\n                                                                   Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                   MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                   Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                   12:04:34\n where it is required to be performed which govern the applicability of the\nlaw. Relying upon the decision of the Supreme Court reported as 1983 (3)\nSCC 61 M.G. Brothers Lorry Services vs. Prasad Textiles it is contended\nthat a contractual provision which has the effect of defeating the provisions\nof law is void under <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act. The decision in\nM.G.Brothers (supra) has been followed by this Court in the decision\nreported as ILR (2010) 2 Del. 699 Simplex Concrete Piles (India) Ltd. vs.\nUnion of India wherein it was also held that a contractual provision which\nresulted in exclusion of <a href=\"/doc/679619/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 55</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1538044/\" id=\"a_9\">72</a> of the Indian Contract Act would\nbe contrary to the public policy of India.\n12.   It is contended that where performance of a contract is in India, the\nparties to a contract can choose a foreign system of law only in two\nconditions, that is, where the conflict of law rules apply which give\nprecedence to the choice of law made by the parties and/or in case of an\nInternational commercial arbitration seated in India as set out in <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_10\">Section\n28(1) (b)</a> of the Act. Merely because the products originated from a country\noutside India would not mean that a foreign system of law would apply to\nthe two parties who are Indians and have agreed to the performance of the\ncontract in India and the same would be a domestic contract between\ndomestic parties only. In the present case no conflict of law rules are\napplicable and thus no precedence to party autonomy can be given. For a\ndomestic contract, parties have no option to choose a foreign law as has\nbeen held by Supreme Court in the decision reported as 1992 (3) SCC 551\nNTPC vs. Singer Co. and by the Full Bench of Bombay High Court in the\ndecision reported as 1957 SCC OnLine Bom 87 The State vs. Narayandas\nMangilal Dayame.      This principle of law has been further upheld by the\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                   Page 8 of 60\n                                                                   Signature Not Verified\n                                                                   Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                   MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                   Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                   12:04:34\n Supreme Court in 1990 (3) SCC 481 British India Steam Navigation Co.\nLtd. vs. Shanmughavilas Cashew Industries and 2001 (4) SCC 713\nSyndicate Bank vs. Prabha D. Naik.\n13.   Referring to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 28</a> of the Act it is contended that provision\nmakes it clear that only if the nationality of one of the parties is non-Indian\ncan a choice be made to have a foreign governing law, thus if the nationality\nof both the parties is Indian then Indian law would be the substantive law\napplicable to the parties. The imperative character of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 28</a> of the Act\nhas been emphasised by the Supreme Court in the decision reported as 2008\n(14) SCC 271 TDM Infrastructure (P) Ltd. vs. UE Development India (P)\nLtd. and also by the Constitution Bench in the decision reported as 2012 (9)\nSCC 552 Bharat Aluminium Company vs. Kaiser Aluminium Technical\nServices Inc. (BALCO). It is contended that the decisions in BALCO (supra)\nand in TDM Infrastructure (supra) have laid down the broad policy principle\nthat the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_13\">Indian Contract Act</a> applies to Indian parties and the applicability\nthis law cannot be circumvented by Indian parties by choosing a foreign seat\nof arbitration. Learned counsel for Dholi Spintex illustrates by examples of\nthe mischief that can be committed if two Indian parties are permitted to\nchoose a foreign governing law. It is stated for instance in the present case\nitself if the parties are not governed by the Indian law but by the English\nlaw, the period of limitation for breach of contract would be six years as\nopposed to three years which is prescribed under the Indian law.\n14.   Rebutting the contention of learned counsel for Louis Dreyfus that an\nexception has been provided under <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act in respect\nof arbitrations, it is contended that the exception to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 28</a> of the\nContract Act is not intended to permit Indian parties to circumvent Indian\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                    Page 9 of 60\n                                                                    Signature Not Verified\n                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                    12:04:34\n laws by resorting to arbitration. The exception to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 28</a> of the Contract\nAct simply allows the parties to have their disputes resolved by arbitration\ninstead of litigation. However, the said exception does not imply that the\nparties can resort to foreign arbitration to escape from India law. Since the\nterms of clause-6 of the contract between Dholi Spintex and Louis Dreyfus\nare contrary to the Indian law and the ICA Bylaws 102, 200, 300\nmandatorily provide for application of substantive law of contract as English\nlaw, Clasue-6 of the contract is liable to be declared null and void. In the\nalternative it is contended that even if this Court holds that Clause-6 cannot\nbe declared as null and void, illegal portions of Clause-6 of the contract may\nbe struck down by applying the „Blue Pencil Test‟ laid down by the\nSupreme Court in the decision reported as 2006 (2) SCC 628 Shin Satellite\nPublic Co. Ltd. vs. Jain Studios Ltd.        By reading Clauses 6 and 7\nharmoniously in terms of the Indian Law it would be aptly clear that the\narbitration would be governed by the Act with its seat in New Delhi and\nvenue in London.\n15.   Rebutting the assertion on behalf of Louis Dreyfus that Clause-7 of\nthe contract has to be read down as the same applies to ancillary issues only,\nit is contended that under Indian law conferment of exclusive jurisdiction on\na particular Court has a definite meaning.       Relying upon the decision\nreported as 2019 (17) SCALE 369: 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1585 BGS SGS\nSoma JV vs. NHPC Ltd. it is contended that where parties have selected the\nseat of arbitration in their agreement, such selection would then amount to\nan exclusive jurisdiction clause and as a corollary the parties‟ intention to\nconfer exclusive jurisdiction on Courts of New Delhi as per Clause-7\nnecessarily indicates their intention to select the seat of arbitration as New\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                   Page 10 of 60\n                                                                    Signature Not Verified\n                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                    12:04:34\n Delhi.\n16.      Referring to the decision of the Supreme Court reported as 1983 (3)\nSCR 662 Dhula Bhai vs. State of Madhya Pradesh it is contended that a suit\nfiled under <a href=\"/doc/76869205/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 9</a> of CPC is maintainable unless expressly barred. There\nbeing no bar to entertain the present anti arbitration injunction suit, the same\nis maintainable. Reliance is further placed on the decision of the Division\nBench of this Court reported as 2016 SCC OnLine Del. 3949 Mcdonald‟s\nIndia Pvt. Limited vs. Vikram Bakshi wherein this Court following the\ndecision of the Calcutta High Court in Board of Trustees of the Port of\nKolkata vs. Louis Dreyfus Armatures SAS, G.A. 1997/2014, CS\nNo.220/2014 held that an anti arbitration injunction can be granted (i) if an\nissue is raised whether there is any valid arbitration agreement between the\nparties and the Court is of the view that no agreement exists between the\nparties; (ii) If the arbitration agreement is null and void, inoperative or\nincapable of being performed; and (iii) Continuation of foreign arbitration\nproceeding might be oppressive or vexatious or unconscionable. It is further\ncontended that the present Court is the only forum with jurisdiction to\ndecide the issues set out in the present suit.\n17.      Reliance is also placed on the decision reported as 2011 SCC OnLine\nDel 3050 Devender Kumar Gupta vs. Reaology Corporation to contend that\nin an application under <a href=\"/doc/779177/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 45</a> of the Act, the validity of the arbitration\nclause has to be decided by the Court and in case the Court skirts the issue\nthe same would run counter to the decisions of the Supreme Court in 2012\n(5) SCC 214 Kvaerner Cementation India Ltd. vs. Bajranflal Agarwal,\n(2005 (8) SCC 618 SBP &amp; Co. vs. Patel Engineering and 2003 (5) SCC 531\nSukanya Holdings (P) Ltd. vs. Jayesh H. Pandya. Even in the decision\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                    Page 11 of 60\n                                                                     Signature Not Verified\n                                                                     Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                     MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                     Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                     12:04:34\n reported as 2014 (11) SCC 639 World Sport Group (Mauritius) Ltd. vs.\nMSM Satellite (Singapore) PTE Ltd. Supreme Court reiterated that the\nprinciples as laid down in <a href=\"/doc/779177/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 45</a> of the Act would be applicable to a suit\nseeking declaration and injunction.\n18.   Referring to the English decisions on the issues, that is, 1993 (1) QB\n701 Harbour Assurance Co. (UK) Ltd. vs. Kansa General Insurance Co.\nLtd. and 2007 (4) All ER 951 Fiona Trust &amp; Holding Corporation vs.\nPrivalov wherein it was held that the question of initial illegality is\nincapable of being referred to arbitration, it is contended that in terms of\n<a href=\"/doc/1911494/\" id=\"a_20\">Sections 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/779177/\" id=\"a_21\">45</a> of the Act, this Court is obligated to refer the parties to\narbitration only if it is prima facie of the view that there exists a valid\narbitration agreement which is capable of being performed. Relying upon\nthe decision of the English Court of Appeals reported as (2019) EWCA Civ\n129 Sabbagh Vs. Khoury &amp; Ors., it is submitted that the present anti-\narbitration suit is maintainable. Reliance is also placed on the decision\nreported as 2005 (8) SCC 618 SBP &amp; Co. vs. Patel Engineering.\n19.   The ICA Arbitral Tribunal is not competent to determine the validity\nof Clause -6 under the Indian law for the reason the Tribunal is a creation of\nthe contract between the parties as also the Arbitral Tribunal appointed by\nthe ICA cannot apply Indian law, even if Indian law is considered to be\nmandatory and non-derogable. Further, though Bylaw 306 provides that the\nTribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction, that is, whether there is a valid\narbitration agreement, whether the Tribunal is properly constituted and what\nmatters can be submitted to arbitration in accordance with the arbitration\nagreement, however, Byelaw 306 is subject to Bylaw 302 which states that\nall Bylaws are mandatory and Bylaw 200 and 300 mandate the application\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                  Page 12 of 60\n                                                                    Signature Not Verified\n                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                    12:04:34\n of English Law as the substantive law. It is contended that not only Dholi\nSpintex has prima facie case in its favour and in case the plaintiff is\nsubjected to arbitration contrary to the law of this country, the plaintiff\nwould suffer irreparable loss. Balance of convenience also lies in favour of\nthe plaintiff. Consequently, a decree of declaration and injunction as sought\nfor be granted.\n20.   Contention of learned counsel for the defendant is that the present suit\nis not maintainable. An anti-arbitration injunction ought not to be granted\nagainst foreign seated arbitration.     The parties have agreed that the\narbitration would be conducted under the ICA Arbitration Bylaws and\nseated at London. The plaintiff having agreed to these terms cannot now\nwriggle out of the same contending that Clause-6 of the Agreement between\nthe parties is null and void. Relying upon Russell on Arbitration, 24th\nEdition, learned counsel for the defendant contends that the discretion to\ngrant an injunction to restrain an arbitration, should be exercised very\nsparingly where the seat of arbitration is in a foreign country. Reliance is\nplaced on the decision of the Division Bench of this Court reported as 2016\nSCC Online Delhi 3949: 232 (2016) DLT394 McDonalds India Pvt. Ltd. vs.\nVikram Bakshi &amp; Ors. wherein the Division Bench cautioned that the trend\nis to minimize the interference with the arbitration process as that is the\nforum of choice. It was held that while the Courts in India may have the\njurisdiction to injunct arbitration proceedings, the said power is required to\nbe exercised rarely and only on principles analogous to those found in\n<a href=\"/doc/1911494/\" id=\"a_22\">Sections 8</a> and <a href=\"/doc/779177/\" id=\"a_23\">45</a> of the Act. This rule of anti-arbitration injunction is\nreaffirmed in Chitty on Contracts, Thirty Third Edition, published by Sweet\nand Maxwell wherein it is stated that it is the Arbitral Tribunal which\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                   Page 13 of 60\n                                                                    Signature Not Verified\n                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                    12:04:34\n generally deals with the issue of its jurisdiction. Bylaw-306 of the ICA\nBylaws empowers and obliges the Arbitral Tribunal to decide matters of\njurisdiction and the validity of underlying arbitration agreement. Reliance is\nplaced    on   the   decision    reported      as   2019   (11)   Scale       440:\nMANU/SC/1153/2019 National Aluminium Company Limited vs. Subhash\nInfra Engineers Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Anr. wherein the Supreme Court held that any\nobjection with respect to existence or validity of the arbitration agreement\ncan be raised only by way of an application under <a href=\"/doc/568692/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 16</a> of the Act and\nthe Civil Court cannot have jurisdiction to go into such question. Reliance\nis also placed on the decision reported as 2012 (5) SCC 215 Kvaerner\nCementation India Ltd. vs. Bajranglal Agarwal &amp; Anr. Referring to the\ndecision reported as 2018 SCC OnLine Delhi 8842 Union of India vs.\nVodafone Group LC United Kingdom &amp; Anr. it is contended that the\nprinciple of kompetenz-kompetenz, is recognized in Article-21 of the\nUNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, 1976 and thus, the arbitrators have\njurisdiction to consider and decide the existence and extent of their own\njurisdiction. The Competence-Competence principle is almost universally\naccepted. Bylaw-306 of the ICA Arbitration Bylaws constitutes a sufficient\nand efficacious remedy for deciding the issues raised in the present suit as\nregards the validity of Clause-6 of the Act.\n21.   The present suit is specifically barred under <a href=\"/doc/779177/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 45</a> of the Act as\nthe said provision mandates rejection of the suit and referring to arbitration\nwith no discretion with this Court. Only if the agreement between the\nparties is null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed, this\nCourt will have jurisdiction to entertain the suit, which on facts of this case\nis not made out.     The term „null and void‟ permits defences based on\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                   Page 14 of 60\n                                                                    Signature Not Verified\n                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                    12:04:34\n unconscionability, fraud, mistake, lack of capacity and illegality. The term\n„inoperative‟ permits defences based on termination, waiver, changed\ncircumstances and repudiation and the term „incapable of being performed‟\nrefers to impossibility and similar defences. Supreme Court in the decision\nreported as 2014 (11) SCC 639 World Sport Group (Mauritius) Ltd. vs.\nMSM Satellite (Singapore), Pte Limited. explained the meaning of words\n„inoperative‟ or „incapable of being performed‟ to mean that where parties,\nby way of conduct, impliedly revoke the arbitration agreement and/or would\nbe a situation where for some reason it is impossible to establish Arbitral\nTribunal. Since in the present case a valid arbitration agreement exists and\nthe disputes between the parties are within the ambit of arbitration\nagreement, any other aspect is irrelevant and alien to <a href=\"/doc/779177/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 45</a> of the Act,\nhence, the suit be dismissed and the application of the defendant be allowed.\n22.   It is contended that the seat of arbitration being London, English\ncourts have exclusive jurisdiction in matters concerning arbitration and New\nDelhi is not the seat of arbitration. Reliance of learned counsel for the\nplaintiff on Clause-7 of the Contract to argue that the seat of arbitration is\nNew Delhi is erroneous. It is well settled that once the arbitration agreement\ndetermines the seat, the exclusive jurisdiction clause cannot change/override\nit. The arbitral seat is a nation where the International Arbitration has its\nlegal domicile or juridical home. The intricate connection between the seat\nof arbitration and the jurisdiction of the Courts attached has been laid down\nby the Supreme Court in the decision reported as 2012 (9) SCC 552 Bharat\nAluminium Company vs. Kaiser Aluminium Technical Services Inc. (in\nshort &#x27;BALCO&#x27;).     It was held that the arbitral procedure, including the\nconstitution of Arbitral Tribunal, shall be governed by the Will of the parties\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                   Page 15 of 60\n                                                                    Signature Not Verified\n                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                    12:04:34\n and by the law of the country in whose territory, the arbitration takes place.\nAn agreement as to the seat of arbitration is analogous to the exclusive\njurisdiction clause and any claim for a remedy as to the validity of an\nexisting interim or final award can be made only in the Courts of the place\ndesignated as the seat of arbitration. Reliance is placed on the decisions\nreported as (2020) 4 SCC 234: 2019 SCC OnLine SC 1585 BGS SGS Soma\nJV vs. NHPC Limited and 2017 (7) SCC 678 Indus Mobile Distribution Pvt.\nLtd. vs. Datawind Innovations Pvt. Ltd. &amp; Ors.\n23.   As the contract between the plaintiff and defendant related to sale of\nimported American cotton and is on &quot;High Seas Sale&quot; basis and the rights,\ntitle and interest of the goods having passed outside the territorial\njurisdiction of India, in such a situation, two Indian parties have agreed to an\nInternational Arbitration. Since at the point of actual sale, as envisioned\nunder the contract, the goods were located in the international waters, there\nexisted potential conflict of laws situation and therefore, the parties in their\nwisdom and with open eyes decided to obviate by agreeing to resolve all\ndisputes by way of arbitration under the ICA Bylaws and Rules. Reliance is\nplaced on the decision reported as 1990 (3) SCC 481 British India Steam\nNavigation Company ltd. vs. Shanmughavilas Cashew Industries &amp; Ors.\n24.   Contention of learned counsel for the plaintiff that no high seas sale\nagreement was arrived at between the parties and the contract agreed was\nclearly domestic transaction, is untenable as subsequent events concerning\nthe manner in which there was breach of contract is completely irrelevant to\ninterpretation of the contract and underlying intention of the parties.\nReliance is placed on the decisions reported as 1961 (1) AC 281 Union\n\n\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                    Page 16 of 60\n                                                                     Signature Not Verified\n                                                                     Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                     MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                     Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                     12:04:34\n Insurance Society of Canton Ltd. vs. George Wills &amp; Co. and 1975 (1) SCC\n199 Godhra Electricity Co. Ltd. vs. State of Gujarat.\n25.   Two Indian parties can agree to arbitrate abroad and there is no legal\nbar to this extent especially where transactions involved foreign elements.\nOne of the central objectives of the international arbitration agreements is to\nprovide neutral forum of dispute resolution.          The principle of Party\nAutonomy is well recognized by the Supreme Court in the decisions\nreported as 1992 (3) SCC 551 National Thermal Power Corporation vs.\nSinger Company &amp; Ors. and British India Steam Navigation Company\n(supra).\n26.   The Bombay High Court in the decision reported as 2012 (3) Mh. L.J.\n94 Sakuma Exports Ltd. vs. Louis Dreyfus Commodities Suisse SA, held that\nthe parties can agree and decide to which law would govern the contract in\nprincipal and/or the arbitration proceedings and the parties may decide to\nhave different laws applicable to the contract and arbitration proceedings.\n27.   It is contended that <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 28 (1) (a)</a> of the Act does not apply to\nforeign seated arbitration and is applicable only to <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_28\">Part-I of the Act</a>.\nApplicability of Part-I and Part-II of the Act is not based on the nationality\nof the parties but solely on the territoriality as to whether the seat of\narbitration is in India or not. Since as per the agreement between the parties,\nseat of arbitration is outside the territorial limits of <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_29\">India, Part-I of the Act</a>\nwould not be applicable. Contention on behalf of the plaintiff that Indian law\nmust govern contract between the two Indian parties, irrespective of the seat\nof arbitration, would render the opening words of the <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 28</a> of the Act,\nthat is, „where the place of arbitration is situate in India‟ as otiose,\nredundant and superfluous. This has been clarified in the decision in para-\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                     Page 17 of 60\n                                                                      Signature Not Verified\n                                                                      Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                      MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                      Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                      12:04:34\n 118 of BALCO (supra). The two mandatory requirements of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 28</a> are\nthat both the parties should be Indian and the seat of arbitration should be in\nIndia. Even if one condition is not met, parties will not be bound to apply\nIndian law as the substantive law. Reliance is placed on the decisions\nreported as 1999 (7) SCC 61 Atlas Export Industries vs. Kotak &amp; Company\nwhich was followed by the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the decision\nreported as 2015 SCC OnLine MP 7417 Sasan Power Limited vs. North\nAmerican Coal Corporation (India) Pvt. Ltd. and of this Court reported as\n2017 SCC OnLine Del. 11625: MANU/DE/3689/2017 GMR Energy Ltd. vs.\nDoosan Power Systems India Pvt. Ltd. The applicability of the Indian law\ncannot be decided merely on the basis of nationality of two contracting\nparties and would depend entirely on the contractual transaction which in the\npresent case is the „high seas sale‟.\n28.   Under the contract between the parties, the seat of arbitration is not\nand cannot be at New Delhi. Clause-6 of the Contract explicitly provides\nthat the venue of the arbitration would be London and Bylaw 300 (3)\nmandates that the seat of the arbitration shall be England and the exclusive\njurisdiction on the arbitral process would vest in the Courts in England.\nAny interpretation based on Clause-7 of the agreement between the parties\nto contend that seat of arbitration is New Delhi would run counter to Clause-\n6 of the contract and would make the same redundant and nugatory and\nwould be contrary to the clear intention of the parties as regards the seat of\narbitration. Supreme Court in the decision reported as 2020 SCC OnLine\nSC 301 Mankatsu Impex Pvt. Ltd. vs. Airvisual Limited dealing with similar\nsituation held that the words in Clause-17.1 of the contract therein do not\nsuggest that the seat of arbitration is in New Delhi and that since the\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                   Page 18 of 60\n                                                                    Signature Not Verified\n                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                    12:04:34\n arbitration was seated at Hong Kong in the said case, the petition filed under\n<a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 11 (6)</a> of the Act was not maintainable and dismissed.                       A\nharmonious construction of Clauses-6 and 7 of the agreement between the\nparties is required to be adopted for a meaningful construction of the two\nClauses and the Clauses are required to be read as a whole and not in parts.\n29.   Heard learned counsels for the parties. Thus contention of learned\ncounsel for the plaintiff in nutshell is that on reading clauses 6 and 7 of the\nagreement between the parties it is evident that though the venue of\narbitration is in London but the seat of arbitration is India and since the ICA\nbyelaws provide for the mandatory application of the Law of England\nthereby ousting the Indian Law, clause 6 of the agreement be either declared\nnull and void or read meaningfully by striking the otiose portions of clause 6\nby applying the blue pencil test. However, broadly the contention of learned\ncounsel for the defendant is that there is no ambiguity in clause 6 and 7 of\nthe agreement between the parties and the present suit is not maintainable\nas the determination sought by the plaintiff is not within the scope of\n<a href=\"/doc/779177/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 45</a> of the Act. Therefore, besides the two issues raised by the\nplaintiff, one more issue which needs determination on the pleadings and\nsubmissions as also for application under <a href=\"/doc/779177/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 45</a> of the Act filed by the\ndefendant, is &quot;Whether the present suit is maintainable or not in terms of\n<a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 45</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, 1996? &quot;.\n30.     ICA‟s Rules and Bylaws which are relevant for the decision of the\npresent suit i.e. Bylaws 200,300 and 306 are as under:\n      &quot;Bylaw 200\n      Every contract made under our Bylaws and Rules will be\n      deemed to be a contract made in England and governed by\n      English law.\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                    Page 19 of 60\n                                                                     Signature Not Verified\n                                                                     Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                     MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                     Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                     12:04:34\n       Bylaw 300\n      1. We will conduct arbitration in one of two ways:\n            Quality arbitrations will deal with disputes\n      arising from the manual examination of the quality of\n      cotton and/or the quality characteristics which can only\n      be determined by instrument testing. Bylaws especially\n      applicable to quality arbitrations and appeals are set\n      out herein.\n      •      Technical arbitrations will deal with all other\n      disputes. Bylaws especially applicable to technical\n      arbitrations are set in.\n      2.    The law of England and Wales and the mandatory\n      provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_36\">Arbitration Act</a> 1996 (Act) shall apply to\n      every arbitration and/or appeal under these Bylaws. The\n      non-mandatory provisions of the Act shall apply save\n      insofar as such provisions are modified by, or are\n      inconsistent with, these Bylaws.\n      3.    The seat of our arbitrations is in England. No one\n      can decide or agree otherwise.\n      4. Disputes shall be settled according to the law of\n      England and Wales wherever domicile, residence, or\n      place of business of the parties to the contract may.\n      5. If parties have agreed to arbitration under our Bylaws,\n      then subject to paragraph (6) below, they must not use\n      any court at all unless we have no further power to do\n      what is required, or the Act allows, in which case they\n      must apply to the courts in England or Wales.\n      6. A party can apply to a court anywhere to obtain\n      security for its claim while arbitration or an appeal is\n      taking place.\n      7. If a party is prevented from proceeding with an\n      arbitration as a result of the application of the provisions\n      of Bylaw 302 (4) or Bylaw 330 (1), it is free to apply to\n      any court which is willing to accept jurisdiction.\n\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                    Page 20 of 60\n                                                                     Signature Not Verified\n                                                                     Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                     MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                     Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                     12:04:34\n       8. Any contract in dispute referred to us for arbitration\n      that has not been, or will not be, performed, will not be\n      treated as cancelled. It will be closed by being invoiced\n      back to the seller under our Rules in force at the date of\n      the contract.\n      9. After eight weeks has passed from the receipt by the\n      Tribunal or Technical Appeal Committee of final written\n      submissions from the parties, the Tribunal or Technical\n      Appeal Committee will send a message to the parties\n      providing them with an update on the status of the Award.\n      Bylaw 306\n      Without prejudice to the provisions of the Act relating to\n      jurisdiction, the tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction,\n      that is, as to whether there is a valid arbitration agreement,\n      whether the tribunal is properly constituted and what matters\n      have been submitted to arbitration in accordance with the\n      arbitration agreement&quot;.\nIssue No.1:-\n31.1 Learned counsel for the plaintiff has strenuously argued that in terms\nof <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 23</a> of the Indian Contract Act, if the contract is of such a nature\nthat if permitted, it would defeat the provisions of law or is opposed to\npublic policy, then, such an agreement is unlawful and void. Case of the\nplaintiff is that since the parties are Indian, contract was entered into in India\nand the performance was also in India, the two Indian parties could not have\navoided the Indian law by choosing a foreign seat of arbitration and a\nspecific foreign system of law. Such term in the contract which allows the\ntwo Indians to escape the rigors of Indian law would be directly contrary to\n<a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 23</a> of the Indian Contract Act. It is stated that the parties can choose\na foreign system of law to govern their contractual relationship, where\nperformance of a contract is in India, only in two instances, firstly, cases\nwhere conflict of law rules apply which gives precedence to the choice of\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                      Page 21 of 60\n                                                                       Signature Not Verified\n                                                                       Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                       MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                       Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                       12:04:34\n law made by the parties and/or in case of an International Commercial\nArbitration seated in India as set out in <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 28(1)(b)</a> of the Act. It is\nsubmitted that the parties have the ability to choose a law of contract only\nwhen there are foreign or transnational elements in the transaction, where\nseveral laws could potentially apply to the rights and obligations of the\nparties.\n31.2 Case of the defendant in this regard is that there is a foreign element\nin the contract between the parties as it is a high seas sale agreement and it\nwas agreed to be performed on high seas, that is, outside the territorial\njurisdiction of India. Therefore, there can be no derogation of the laws of\nIndia. Since at the point of actual sale as envisaged in the contract, the\ngoods were located in international waters, there existed potential conflict of\nlaws situation, therefore, the two Indian parties voluntarily chose to resolve\nall disputes by having English law as the governing law of arbitration under\nthe ICA Bylaws and Rules.\n31.3 Countering these arguments, learned counsel for the plaintiff has\nsubmitted that the argument of the defendant, thus, accepts the proposition\nthat two Indian parties cannot agree to application of a foreign system of law\nunless the transaction involves a foreign element. To counter the argument\nof the defendant that there is a foreign element in the transaction between\nthe parties as it is a high seas sale agreement and the property in the goods\npassed on to the plaintiff in international waters, plaintiff relied upon the\ndelivery terms mentioned in the contract which states &quot;CIF CY Mundra,\nIndia on High-Seas Sale Basis, final place of delivery ICD Ahmedabad on\ncost and risk of Recipient. Risk and title of goods passes from Supplier to\nRecipient upon signing of high-seas sales agreement&quot;.\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                   Page 22 of 60\n                                                                    Signature Not Verified\n                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                    12:04:34\n 31.4 According to the plaintiff, reference to High Seas sale agreement is\nonly in the perspective as to the party which would bear the incidence of tax\nwhen the goods are imported and delivered at Mundra, India. Referring to\nthe decision of the Constitution Bench in (1960) 2 SCR 852 J.V.Gokal Vs.\nAssistant Collector of Sales Tax (Inspection) and Others, it is stated that the\nimport and export of goods can have an international element only when one\nof the party is a foreign party.\n31.5 The issue raised by learned counsel for the plaintiff that whether two\nIndian parties can choose a foreign system of law as the substantive law of\nthe contract i.e. whether two Indian parties can agree to contract out of\nsubstantive Indian law is no more res-integra having been decided by the\nSupreme Court, Madhya Pradesh High Court and this Court as well. In the\ndecision reported as 1999 (7) SCC 61 Atlas Export Industries vs. Kotak &amp;\nCompany Supreme Court dealing with this issue, referring to Exception 1 to\n<a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 28</a> of the Indian Contract Act held that an agreement to refer the\ndisputes to arbitration does not imply that there is an exclusion by the\nagreement to have recourse to legal proceedings. It was further held that\nmerely because arbitrators are situated in a foreign country cannot by itself\nbe enough to nullify the arbitration agreement.\n31.6 Following the decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in Atlas Export\n(supra) the Division Bench of the Madhya Pradesh High Court in the\ndecision reported as 2015 SCC OnLine MP 7417 Sasan Power Limited vs.\nNorth American Coal Corporation (India) Pvt. Ltd. dealt with the issue\nraised in the present suit at length. Noting para-118 of the decision in\nBALCO (supra) it was held:\n\n\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                   Page 23 of 60\n                                                                    Signature Not Verified\n                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                    12:04:34\n           &quot;46. Finally, in paragraph 118, the crucial part heavily\n      relied upon by Shri. V.K. Tankha, learned Senior Advocate,\n      reference is made to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_41\">section 28</a>, and it is held as under:\n          „118. It was submitted by the learned counsel for the\n      appellants that <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 28</a> is another indication of the intention\n      of Parliament that <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_43\">Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996</a> was not\n      confined to arbitrations which take place in India. We are\n      unable to accept the submissions made by the learned counsel\n      for the parties. As the heading of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 28</a> indicates, its only\n      purpose is to identify the rules that would be applicable to\n      „substance of dispute‟. In other words, it deals with the\n      applicable conflict of law rules. This section makes a\n      distinction between purely domestic arbitrations and\n      international commercial arbitrations, with a seat in India.\n      <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 28(1)(a)</a> makes it clear that in an arbitration under\n      Part I to which <a href=\"/doc/831280/\" id=\"a_46\">section 2(1)(f)</a> does not apply, there is no\n      choice but for the Tribunal to decide „the dispute‟ by applying\n      the Indian „substantive law applicable to the contract‟. This is\n      clearly to ensure that two or more Indian parties do not\n      circumvent the substantive Indian law, by resorting to\n      arbitrations. The provision would have an overriding effect\n      over any other contrary provision in such contract. On the\n      other hand, where an arbitration under Part I is an\n      international commercial arbitration within <a href=\"/doc/831280/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 2(1)(f)</a>, the\n      parties would be free to agree to any other „substantive law‟\n      and if not so agreed, the „substantive law‟ applicable would be\n      as determined by the Tribunal. The section merely shows that\n      the legislature has segregated the domestic and international\n      arbitration. Therefore, to suit India, conflict of law rules have\n      been suitably modified, where the arbitration is in India. This\n      will not apply where the seat is outside India. In that event, the\n      conflict of law rules of the country in which the arbitration\n      takes place would have to be applied. Therefore, in our\n      opinion, the emphasis placed on the express „where the place\n      of arbitration is situated in India‟, by the learned Senior\n      Counsel for the appellants, is not indicative of the fact that the\n      intention of Parliament was to give an extra-territorial\n\n\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                   Page 24 of 60\n                                                                    Signature Not Verified\n                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                    12:04:34\n       operation to <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_48\">Part I of the Arbitration Act, 1996</a>.‟ (Emphasis\n      supplied)\n          47. Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court holds that <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_49\">section 28</a> makes a\n      clear distinction between purely domestic arbitration and\n      international arbitration with a seat in India, and it is indicated\n      that <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_50\">section 28(1)(a)</a> makes it clear that in an arbitration under\n      Part I to which <a href=\"/doc/831280/\" id=\"a_51\">section 2(1)(f)</a> does not apply, there is no\n      choice but for the Tribunal to decide the dispute by applying\n      the Indian substantive law applicable to the Contract. It is this\n      part of the judgment which was heavily relied upon by Shri.\n      V.K. Tankha, learned Senior Advocate further refers to the next\n      sentence which says that two or more Indian parties cannot\n      circumvent the substantive Indian Law by resorting to\n      arbitration. By placing much emphasis on this part, learned\n      Senior Advocate tried to indicate that the order of the learned\n      District Judge is unsustainable.\n          48. However, if we further read the findings recorded by the\n      Supreme Court in the same paragraph 118, as reproduced\n      hereinabove, it is held by the Supreme Court that when the seat\n      is outside India, the conflict of law rule of the country in which\n      the arbitration takes place would have to be applied, and\n      thereafter it is held that the expression „whether the place of\n      arbitration is situated in India‟ does not indicate the intention\n      of the Parliament to give extra territorial operation to Part I, of\n      the Arbitration Act of 1996. In paragraph 123 also, the matter\n      has been considered in the backdrop of the provisions\n      contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_52\">section 28</a>, this also makes us to come to\n      the inevitable conclusion that the provisions of Part I will not\n      apply where the seat of arbitration is outside India.\n          49. On consideration of the law laid down in the case\n      of TDM Infrastructure (supra), we find, that the proceeding\n      before the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court was with regard to\n      appointing an arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_53\">section 11(6)</a> and after taking\n      note of the definition of International Commercial Arbitration\n      as provided in <a href=\"/doc/831280/\" id=\"a_54\">section 2(1)(f)</a>, the procedure for appointment of\n      arbitrator and the provision of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_55\">section 28</a>, it was held that <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_56\">Part\n      I of the Act</a> of 1996 deals with domestic arbitration and Part II\n      deals with „foreign award‟, and by specifically taking note of\n\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                    Page 25 of 60\n                                                                     Signature Not Verified\n                                                                     Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                     MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                     Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                     12:04:34\n       the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_57\">section 28</a>, has held that companies\n      incorporated in India and when both the parties have Indian\n      nationality, then such arbitration cannot be said to be an\n      international commercial arbitration. However, after having\n      said so, in paragraph 23 reference is made to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_58\">section 28</a>, the\n      intention of the legislature, to hold that two Indian nationals\n      should not be permitted to derogate Indian Law.\n          50. Finally, in para 23 the following observations are made\n      by the Supreme Court in the aforesaid case:-\n            „23. <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 28</a> of the 1996 Act is imperative in\n            character in view of <a href=\"/doc/831280/\" id=\"a_60\">Section 2(6)</a> thereof, which\n            excluded the same from those provisions which\n            parties derogate from (if so provided by the\n            Act). The intention of the legislature appears to be\n            clear that Indian nationals should not be permitted\n            to derogate from Indian Law. This is part of the\n            public policy of the country.\n            36. It is, however, made clear that any\n            findings/observations made hereinbefore were only\n            for the purpose of determining the jurisdiction of\n            this Court as envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 11</a> of the\n            1996 Act and not for any other purpose.‟\n                                                   (Emphasis Supplied)\n          51. If we analyse this judgment, we find, that apart from\n      being one rendered in a proceeding held under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_62\">section 11(6)</a>, is\n      based on the consideration made with reference to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_63\">section\n      28(1)</a>, as is evident from paragraph 23 relied upon by Shri.\n      V.K. Tankha and thereafter in paragraph 36, a caution is\n      indicated with regard to applicability of this judgment. Whereas\n      in the case of Atlas Exports (supra), we find that in Atlas\n      Exports, in paragraphs 10 and 11, the following principles have\n      been laid down:-\n               „10. It was however contended by the learned\n           counsel for the appellant that the award should have\n           been held to be unenforceable in as much as the\n           very contract between the parties relating to\n           arbitration was opposed to public policy under\n           <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 23</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_65\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act.\n\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                 Page 26 of 60\n                                                                  Signature Not Verified\n                                                                  Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                  MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                  Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                  12:04:34\n            It was submitted that Atlas and Kotak, the parties\n           between whom the dispute arose, are both Indian\n           parties and the contract which had the effect of\n           compelling them to resort to arbitration by foreign\n           arbitrators and thereby impliedly excluding the\n           remedy available to them under the ordinary law of\n           India should be held to be opposed to public\n           policy. Under <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_66\">section 23</a> of the Indian Contract Act\n           the consideration or object or an agreement is\n           unlawful if it is opposed to public policy. <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_67\">Section 28</a>\n           and Exception 1 to it, (which only is relevant for the\n           purpose of this case) are extracted and reproduced\n           hereunder:\n           „28. Every agreement, by which any party thereto is\n           restricted absolutely from enforcing his rights under\n           or in respect of any contract, by the usual legal\n           proceedings in the ordinary tribunals, or which\n           limits the time within which he may thus enforce his\n           rights, is void to that extent.\n           Exception 1 - This section shall not render illegal a\n           contract, by which two or more persons agree that\n           any dispute which may arise between them in\n           respect of any subject or class of subjects shall be\n           referred to arbitration, and that only the amount\n           awarded in such arbitration shall be recoverable in\n           respect of the dispute so referred.‟\n               11. The case at hand is clearly covered by Exception 1\n           to <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_68\">Section 28</a>.

Merely because the\n           arbitrators are situated in a foreign country cannot by\n           itself be enough to nullify the arbitration agreement when\n           the parties have with their eyes open willingly entered into\n           the agreement. Moreover, in the case at hand the parties\n           have willing initiated the arbitration proceedings on the\n           disputes having arisen between them.

In this case i.e. Atlas Exports (supra), <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_69\">Sections 23</a> and\n      <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_70\">28</a> of the Contract Act are considered and it is held that when a\n      dispute arises where both the parties are Indian, and if the\n      contract has the effect of compelling them to resort to\n      arbitration by foreign arbitrators and thereby impliedly\n      excluding the remedy available to them under the ordinary law\n      of India, the same is not opposed to public policy. <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 28</a>\n      exception (1) of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_72\">Contract Act</a> is taken note of and it is held\n      that merely because the arbitrators are situated in a foreign\n      country that by itself cannot be enough to nullify the arbitration\n      agreement, when the parties have with their eyes open,\n      willingly entered into an agreement. If this observation made by\n      the Supreme Court is taken note of, we find that merely because\n      two Indian companies have entered into an arbitration\n      agreement to be held in a foreign country by agreed\n      arbitrators, that by itself is not enough to nullify the arbitration\n      agreement.\n          53. Shri. V.K. Tankha, learned Senior Advocate, tried to\n      indicate that Atlas Exports (supra) case was rendered in a\n      proceeding held under the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_73\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a> which is\n      entirely different from the Act of 1996 and, therefore, the said\n      judgment will not apply in the present case. Instead, the\n      judgment in the case of TDM Infrastructure (supra) would be\n      applicable.\n          54. We cannot accept the aforesaid proposition. Shri.\n      Anirudh Krishnan, learned counsel, had taken us through the\n      provisions of both the Act of 1940 and the Act of 1996, and\n      thereafter he had referred to the judgment of the Supreme\n      Court in the case of Fuerst Day Lawson Limited (supra), where\n      after a detailed comparison of various sections of both the Acts,\n      from paragraphs 65 onwards, Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                     Page 28 of 60\n                                                                      Signature Not Verified\n                                                                      Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                      MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                      Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                      12:04:34\n       discussed the provisions of both Acts, and finally has observed\n      that there is not much of a difference between them. If the\n      aforesaid judgment in the case of Fuerst Day Lawson\n      Limited (supra) is considered, the same holds that both, the Act\n      of 1980 and 1996 are identical and the Hon&#x27;ble Court has also\n      indicated the similarity in both the Acts. That being so, we see\n      no reason as to why the principle laid down of Atlas\n      Exports (supra), which is by a Larger Bench i.e.. Division\n      Bench, should not be applied particularly in the light of the law\n      of precedent as laid down in the case of A.R. Antulay (supra).\n      The contention of Shri. V.K. Tankha, learned Senior Advocate,\n      that the learned District Judge relied upon the judgment in the\n      case of Atlas Exports (supra) and refused to rely upon the case\n      of TDM Infrastructure (supra) only because it is by a Single\n      Bench is not convincing or acceptable, as the Division Bench\n      Judgment in the case of Atlas Exports (supra) is a binding\n      precedent and once it is held in the aforesaid case that two\n      Indian companies can agree to arbitrate in a foreign country\n      and the same is not hit by public policy, we see no error in the\n      order passed by the learned District Judge.\n         55. That apart, we also find that in the case of TDM\n      Infrastructure (supra), a note of caution is indicated in\n      paragraph 36, which was added by a corrigendum subsequent\n      to pronouncement of judgment, this clearly indicates the\n      principle laid down by the Supreme Court was only for\n      determining the jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1523259/\" id=\"a_74\">section 11</a> and nothing more.\n      We need not go into the questions any further now, as we find\n      that the judgment in the case of Atlas Exports (supra) is a\n      binding precedent.\n         56.                     xxx\n         57. On going through the scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_75\">Arbitration and\n      Conciliation Act, 1996</a>, we find that based on the seat of\n      arbitration so also the nationality of parties, an arbitration is\n      classified to be an „International Arbitration‟, and the\n      governing law is also determined on the basis of the seat of\n      arbitration. Therefore, it is clear that based on the seat of\n      arbitration, the question of permitting two Indian\n      companies/parties to arbitrate out of India is permissible.

Now, if two Indian Companies agree to have\n       their seat of arbitration in a foreign country, the question would\n       be as to whether the provisions of Part I or Part II would apply.\n       <a href=\"/doc/1513012/\" id=\"a_76\">Section 44</a>, of the Act of 1996, contemplates a foreign award to\n       be one pertaining to difference between persons arising out of\n       legal relationship, whether contractual or not, which is in\n       pursuance to an agreement in writing for arbitration, to which\n       the convention set forth in the first schedule applies.&quot;\n\n31.7         The decision in Sasan Power Limited (supra) was taken in\nappeal to Supreme Court, however, the Supreme Court did not deal with the\nsaid issue as the same was given up by learned counsel for Sasan Power\nLimited.\n31.8         This Court dealing with the same proposition i.e. whether two\nIndians can agree to arbitrate out of Indian law in the decision reported as\n2017 (6) ArbLR 447 (Delhi): 2017 SCC OnLine Del 11625 GMR Energy\nLimited vs. Doosan Power System India Ltd. &amp; Ors. following the decision\nof the Supreme Court in Atlas Exports (supra) and in Sasan Power Limited\n(supra) held that two Indians can agree to a foreign seated arbitration.\n31.9         It is trite law as laid down by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the\ndecision reported as 2014 (7) SCC 603 Reliance Industries &amp; Anr. vs. Union\nof India that when there is a foreign element to the arbitration three sets of\nlaw may apply to an arbitration, that is, proper law of the contract; proper\nlaw of the arbitration agreement/lex arbitri; and proper law of the conduct of\narbitration/lex fori/curial law. It was held:\n       69. Mr Ganguli has next sought to persuade us that the seat\n       of arbitration shall be in India as the PSC is governed by the\n       law of India.

Therefore, irrespective of the\n      provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_78\">Article 33.12</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_79\">Arbitration Act,\n      1996</a> would be applicable to arbitration proceedings. The\n      English law would be applicable only in relation to the conduct\n      of the arbitration up to the passing of the partial final award.\n      We are unable to accept the aforesaid submissions of Mr\n      Ganguli. As noticed earlier, <a href=\"/doc/846967/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 32.1</a> itself provides that it\n      shall be subject to the provision of <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_81\">Article 33.12.</a> <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_82\">Article 33.12</a>\n      provides that the arbitration agreement contained in this\n      article shall be governed by the laws of England. The term\n      &quot;laws of England&quot; cannot be given a restricted meaning\n      confined to only curial law. It is permissible under law for the\n      parties to provide for different laws of the contract and the\n      arbitration agreement and the curial law. In Naviera\n      Amazonica SA [Naviera Amazonica Peruana S.A. v. Compania\n      Internacional De Seguros Del Peru, (1988) 1 Lloyd&#x27;s Rep 116\n      (CA)] , the Court of Appeal in England considered an\n      agreement which contained a clause providing for the\n      jurisdiction of the courts in Lima, Peru in the event of judicial\n      dispute and at the same time contained a clause providing that\n      the arbitration would be governed by the English law and the\n      procedural law of arbitration shall be the English law. The\n      Court of Appeal observed as follows:\n             &quot;All contracts which provide for arbitration and\n             contain a foreign element may involve three\n             potentially relevant systems of law: (1) the law\n             governing the substantive contract; (2) the law\n             governing the agreement to arbitrate and the\n             performance of that agreement; (3) the law governing\n             the conduct of the arbitration. In the majority of cases\n             all three will be the same. But (1) will often be\n             different from (2) and (3). And occasionally, but\n             rarely (2) may also differ from (3).&quot;\n      70. From the above, it is evident that it was open to the\n      parties to agree that the law governing the substantive contract\n      (PSC) would be different from the law governing the\n      arbitration agreement. This is precisely the situation in the\n      present case. <a href=\"/doc/846967/\" id=\"a_83\">Article 32.1</a> specifically provides that the\n\nCS(COMM) 286/2020                                                  Page 31 of 60\n                                                                   Signature Not Verified\n                                                                   Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE\n                                                                   MUKTA GUPTA\n                                                                   Signing Date:24.11.2020\n                                                                   12:04:34\n       performance of the contractual obligations under the PSC\n      would be governed and interpreted under the laws of India. So\n      far as the alternative dispute redressal agreement i.e. the\n      arbitration agreement is concerned, it would be governed by\n      the laws of England. There is no basis on which the\n      respondents can be heard to say that the applicability of laws</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_1\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"216597\" id=\"span_1\">of England related only to the conduct of arbitration reference.\n      The law governing the conduct of the arbitration is\n      interchangeably referred to as the curial law or procedural\n      law or the lex fori. The delineation of the three operative laws\n      as given in Naviera Amazonica [Naviera Amazonica Peruana\n      S.A. v. Compania Internacional De Seguros Del Peru, (1988) 1\n      Lloyd&#x27;s Rep 116 (CA)] has been specifically followed by this\n      Court in <a href=\"/doc/216597/\" id=\"a_84\">Sumitomo [Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd. v. ONGC\n      Ltd.</a>, (1998) 1 SCC 305] . The Court also, upon a survey, of a\n      number of decisions rendered by the English courts and after\n      referring to the views expressed by learned commentators on\n      international commercial arbitration concluded that:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"216597\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"216597\" id=\"span_3\">(<a href=\"/doc/216597/\" id=\"a_85\">Sumitomo Heavy Industries Ltd.</a> case [<a href=\"/doc/216597/\" id=\"a_86\">Sumitomo Heavy\n      Industries Ltd. v.

The law which would apply to the filing of the\n             award, to its enforcement and to its setting aside\n             would be the law governing the agreement to\n             arbitrate and the performance of that agreement.&quot;</span></span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">      71. In coming to the aforesaid conclusion, this Court relied on\n      a passage from Law and Practice of Commercial Arbitration in\n      England, 2nd Edn., by Mustill and Boyd which is as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">             &quot;An agreed reference to arbitration involves two groups\n             of obligations. The first concerns the mutual obligations\n             of the parties to submit future disputes, or an existing\n             dispute to arbitration, and to abide by the award of a\n             tribunal constituted in accordance with the agreement. It\n             is now firmly established that the arbitration agreement\n             which creates these obligations is a separate contract,\n             distinct from the substantive agreement in which it is\n             usually embedded, capable of surviving the termination\n             of the substantive agreement and susceptible of\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">CS(COMM) 286/2020                                                 Page 32 of 60</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                                                  Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                  Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                  MUKTA GUPTA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                  Signing Date:24.11.2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                                                  12:04:34</span>\n              premature termination by express or implied consent, or\n             by repudiation or frustration, in much the same manner\n             as in more ordinary forms of contract. Since this\n             agreement has a distinct life of its own, it may in\n             principle be governed by a proper law of its own, which\n             need not be the same as the law governing the\n             substantive contract.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">                    The second group of obligations, consisting of\n             what is generally referred to as the „curial law‟ of the\n             arbitration, concerns the manner in which the parties\n             and the arbitrator are required to conduct the reference\n             of a particular dispute. According to the English theory\n             of arbitration, these rules are to be ascertained by\n             reference to the express or implied terms of the\n             agreement to arbitrate. This being so, it will be found in\n             the great majority of cases that the curial law i.e. the law\n             governing the conduct of the reference, is the same as\n             the law governing the obligation to arbitrate. It is,\n             however, open to the parties to submit, expressly or by\n             implication, the conduct of the reference to a different\n             law from the one governing the underlying arbitration\n             agreement. In such a case, the court looks first at the\n             arbitration agreement to see whether the dispute is one\n             which should be arbitrated, and which has validly been\n             made the subject of the reference, it then looks to the\n             curial law to see how that reference should be conducted\n             and then returns to the first law in order to give effect to\n             the resulting award.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">                                     ***\n                    It may therefore be seen that problems arising out\n             of an arbitration may, at least in theory, call for the\n             application of any one or more of the following laws:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                    1.

The following passage from Redfern and Hunter on\n      International Arbitration contains the following explication of\n      the issue:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">             „It is also sometimes said that parties have selected\n             the procedural law that will govern their\n             arbitration, by providing for arbitration in a\n             particular country. This is too elliptical and, as an\n             English court itself held more recently in Breas of\n             Doune Wind Farm it does not always hold true.\n             What the parties have done is to choose a place of\n             arbitration in a particular country. That choice\n             brings with it submission to the laws of that\n             country, including any mandatory provisions of its\n             law on arbitration. To say that the parties have\n             &quot;chosen&quot; that particular law to govern the\n             arbitration is rather like saying that an English\n             woman who takes her car to France has &quot;chosen&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_3\">             French traffic law, which will oblige her to drive on\n             the right-hand side of the road, to give priority to\n             vehicles approaching from the right, and generally\n             to obey traffic laws to which she may not be\n             accustomed. But it would be an odd use of language\n             to say this notional motorist had opted for &quot;French\n             traffic law&quot;. What she has done is to choose to go\n             to France. The applicability of French law then\n             follows automatically. It is not a matter of choice.\n      Parties may well choose a particular place of arbitration\n      precisely because its lex arbitri is one which they find\n      attractive. Nevertheless, once a place of arbitration has been\n      chosen, it brings with it its own law. If that law contains\n      provisions that are mandatory so far as arbitration is\n      concerned, those provisions must be obeyed. It is not a\n      matter of choice any more than the notional motorist is free\n      to choose which local traffic laws to obey and which to\n      disregard.&quot;\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">CS(COMM) 286/2020                                               Page 35 of 60</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                                                Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                                                Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                                MUKTA GUPTA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                                                Signing Date:24.11.2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                                12:04:34</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_4\"> 31.11        It is thus well settled that even though an agreement to refer\ndisputes to arbitration may be a part of the substantive contract, however,\nthe said agreement is independent of the substantive contract and survives\ndespite termination or repudiation or frustration of the substantive contract.\nThus an arbitration agreement/clause does not govern the rights and\nobligations arising out of the substantive contract and only governs the\nmanner of settling disputes between the parties.

The fact whether the plaintiff and defendant performed a high seas\nsales agreement or not would not determine the ambit of Clause-6 of the\nagreement between the parties. Intention of the parties as on the date when\nthey entered into the contract dated 30th May, 2019 has to be deciphered\nfrom which it is evident that the parties were performing a high seas sales\nagreement.    The plaintiff having not fulfilled its obligation of making\npayments ten days prior to the reaching of the goods at the Mundra Port, the\nfact that subsequently custom duty was paid by the defendant or that the bill\nof lading was entered into in the name of the defendant would not furnish a\ncontrary intention to the terms of agreement between the parties that the\nagreement was for a high seas sales agreement. The plaintiff having\ncommitted breach of contract, the plaintiff cannot take the plea of\nsubsequent novation of the contract and thereby contend that the agreement\nbetween the parties was not a high seas sales agreement.\n31.18        Therefore, an arbitration agreement between the parties being\nan agreement independent of the substantive contract and the parties can\nchoose a different governing law for the arbitration, two Indian parties can\nchoose a foreign law as the law governing arbitration.

On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it may be\n      concluded that whenever there is the designation of a place of\n      arbitration in an arbitration clause as being the &quot;venue&quot; of the\n      arbitration proceedings, the expression &quot;arbitration\n      proceedings&quot; would make it clear that the &quot;venue&quot; is really the\n      &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitral proceedings, as the aforesaid expression\n      does not include just one or more individual or particular\n      hearing, but the arbitration proceedings as a whole, including\n      the making of an award at that place. This language has to be\n      contrasted with language such as &quot;tribunals are to meet or\n      have witnesses, experts or the parties&quot; where only hearings are\n      to take place in the &quot;venue&quot;, which may lead to the conclusion,\n      other things being equal, that the venue so stated is not the\n      &quot;seat&quot; of arbitral proceedings, but only a convenient place of\n      meeting. Further, the fact that the arbitral proceedings &quot;shall\n      be held&quot; at a particular venue would also indicate that the\n      parties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to a particular\n      place, signifying thereby, that that place is the seat of the\n      arbitral proceedings. This, coupled with there being no other\n      significant contrary indicia that the stated venue is merely a\n      &quot;venue&quot; and not the &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitral proceedings, would\n      then conclusively show that such a clause designates a &quot;seat&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">      of the arbitral proceedings.

The term &quot;subject-matter&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/831280/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 2(1)(e)</a> is confined\n      to Part I. It has a reference and connection with the process of\n      dispute resolution. Its purpose is to identify the courts having\n      supervisory control over the arbitration proceedings. Hence, it\n      refers to a court which would essentially be a court of the seat\n      of the arbitration process. In our opinion, the provision in\n      <a href=\"/doc/831280/\" id=\"a_103\">Section 2(1)(e)</a> has to be construed keeping in view the\n      provisions in <a href=\"/doc/483593/\" id=\"a_104\">Section 20</a> which give recognition to party\n      autonomy. Accepting the narrow construction as projected by\n      the learned counsel for the appellants would, in fact, render\n      <a href=\"/doc/483593/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 20</a> nugatory. In our view, the legislature has\n      intentionally given jurisdiction to two courts i.e. the court\n      which would have jurisdiction where the cause of action is\n      located and the courts where the arbitration takes place. This\n      was necessary as on many occasions the agreement may\n      provide for a seat of arbitration at a place which would be\n      neutral to both the parties. Therefore, the courts where the\n      arbitration takes place would be required to exercise\n      supervisory control over the arbitral process. For example, if\n      the arbitration is held in Delhi, where neither of the parties are\n      from Delhi, (Delhi having been chosen as a neutral place as\n      between a party from Mumbai and the other from Kolkata) and\n      the tribunal sitting in Delhi passes an interim order Under\n      <a href=\"/doc/318136/\" id=\"a_106\">Section 17</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996, the appeal against such\n      an interim order under <a href=\"/doc/1821948/\" id=\"a_107\">Section 37</a> must lie to the courts of\n      Delhi being the courts having supervisory jurisdiction over the\n      arbitration proceedings and the tribunal. This would be\n      irrespective of the fact that the obligations to be performed\n      under the contract were to be performed either at Mumbai or at\n      Kolkata, and only arbitration is to take place in Delhi. In such\n      circumstances, both the courts would have jurisdiction i.e. the\n      court within whose jurisdiction the subject-matter of the suit is\n      situated and the courts within the jurisdiction of which the\n      dispute resolution i.e. arbitration is located.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">CS(COMM) 286/2020                                                   Page 45 of 60</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">                                                                    Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                                                                    12:04:34</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"> 32.3         However, in BGS SGS Soma JV (supra) Supreme Court further\nreiterated the law that the judgements of the Court are not to be construed as\nstatutes nor are they to be read as Euclid&#x27;s theorems.

The judgments of the English courts have examined the\n       concept of the &quot;juridical seat&quot; of the arbitral proceedings, and\n       have laid down several important tests in order to determine\n       whether the &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitral proceedings has, in fact,\n       been indicated in the agreement between the parties.

This is because of the\n              legislative framework and supervisory powers of the\n              courts here which many parties are keen to adopt. When\n              therefore there is an express designation of the\n              arbitration venue as London and no designation of any\n              alternative place as the seat, combined with a\n              supranational body of rules governing the arbitration\n              and no other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable\n              conclusion is, to my mind, that London is the juridical\n              seat and English Law the curial law.

The\n      agreement between the parties that the dispute &quot;shall be\n      referred to and finally resolved by arbitration administered in\n      Hong Kong&quot; clearly suggests that the parties have agreed that\n      the arbitration be seated at Hong Kong and that laws of Hong\n      Kong shall govern the arbitration proceedings as well as have\n      power of judicial review over the arbitration award.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">      22.

The words in Clause 17.2 that &quot;arbitration administered\n      in Hong Kong&quot; is an indicia that the seat of arbitration is at\n      Hong Kong.

The relationship between the seat of arbitration and the law\n      governing arbitration is an integral one. The seat of arbitration\n      is defined as the juridical seat of arbitration designated by the\n      parties, or by the arbitral institution or by the arbitrators\n      themselves, as the case may be. It is pertinent to refer to the\n      following passage from Redfern and Hunter on International\n      Arbitration [Redfern and Hunter on International Arbitration,\n      5th Edn. (Oxford University Press, 2009)]:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">             &quot;This introduction tries to make clear, the place or\n             seat of the arbitration is not merely a matter of\n             geography. It is the territorial link between the\n             arbitration itself and the law of the place in which\n             that arbitration is legally situated:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">             When one says that London, Paris or Geneva is the\n             place of arbitration, one does not refer solely to a\n             geographical location. One means that the\n             arbitration is conducted within the framework of\n             the law of arbitration of England, France or\n             Switzerland or, to use an English expression,\n             under the curial law of the relevant country. The\n             geographical place of arbitration is the factual\n             connecting factor between that arbitration law and\n             the arbitration proper, considered as a nexus of\n             contractual and procedural rights and obligations\n             between the parties and the arbitrators.\n             The seat of arbitration is thus intended to be its\n             centre of gravity.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">32.7 Thus even if in Clause 6 of the agreement between the parties the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_128\">CS(COMM) 286/2020                                                 Page 51 of 60</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">                                                                  Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">                                                                  Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                                                                  MUKTA GUPTA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                                                                  Signing Date:24.11.2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">                                                                  12:04:34</span>\n term &#x27;Venue&#x27; has been used, by agreeing to conduct the arbitration through\nICA the parties have agreed that the seat of arbitration would be London and\nnot Delhi even though by Clause 7 the Substantive Law of the contract is\nIndian Law and parties have agreed to exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts at\nDelhi. Since as per clause 6 of the contract between the parties it has been\nspecifically agreed that any dispute arising out of this contract shall be\nresolved through arbitration in accordance with International Cotton\nAssociation Rules and arbitration procedure, the parties have thus agreed to\nabide by the rules and byelaws of the ICA which provide that the seat of\narbitration is in London and the law of England and Wales shall apply to\nevery arbitration and/or appeal under these byelaws. Clause 7 entered into\nbetween the parties would be relevant if by an agreement both parties decide\nnot to settle their disputes through arbitration but by approaching the Court\nof law, in which case the exclusive jurisdiction would be of the Courts at\nNew Delhi.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_35\">32.8           Therefore, in view of the above discussion, express designation\nof jurisdiction of a Court at New Delhi under Clause 7 of the contract dated\n30th May, 2019 is not determinative of the seat of arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_36\">Issue No.3:-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_37\">33.1           Having held that two Indian parties can agree to submit to\nforeign jurisdiction for arbitration and in terms of Clause 6 of the contract\nbetween the parties, the seat of arbitration and not merely the venue is at\nLondon, the issue which would thus arise is whether the present suit is\nmaintainable in terms of requirement of <a href=\"/doc/779177/\" id=\"a_134\">Section 45</a> of the Act i.e. whether it\nis for this Court or the Arbitrator to determine whether the agreement\nbetween the plaintiff and defendant is a high seas sale agreement or not or\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">CS(COMM) 286/2020                                                   Page 52 of 60</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">                                                                    Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">                                                                    Digitally Signed By:JUSTICE</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">                                                                    MUKTA GUPTA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                                                                    Signing Date:24.11.2020</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">                                                                    12:04:34</span>\n whether any foreign element is involved or not in the agreement between\nparties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">33.2           To contend that the validity of the arbitration agreement has to\nbe gone into by this Court, learned counsel for the plaintiff relies upon the\ndecision in SBP &amp; Co.

It is also not possible to accept the argument that there\n           is an exclusive conferment of jurisdiction on the Arbitral\n           Tribunal, to decide on the existence or validity of the\n           arbitration agreement. <a href=\"/doc/1911494/\" id=\"a_135\">Section 8</a> of the Act contemplates a\n           judicial authority before which an action is brought in a\n           matter which is the subject of an arbitration agreement, on\n           the terms specified therein, to refer the dispute to\n           arbitration. A judicial authority as such is not defined in the\n           Act. It would certainly include the court as defined in\n           <a href=\"/doc/1089645/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 2(e)</a> of the Act and would also, in our opinion,\n           include other courts and may even include a special\n           tribunal like the Consumer Forum (see <a href=\"/doc/1061470/\" id=\"a_137\">Fair Air Engineers\n           (P) Ltd. v.

It is also important to note that although the competence-\n       competence principle was applicable and the arbitral tribunal\n       had the requisite competence to determine its own jurisdiction,\n       the courts in England retained the jurisdiction to determine the\n       issue as to whether there was ever an agreement to arbitrate.\n       In our view, the same principle would apply insofar as the\n       courts in India are concerned. The courts in India would\n       certainly have the jurisdiction to determine the question as to\n       whether an arbitration agreement was void or a nullity.

Parasram\n       Holdings Pvt. Ltd.</a>, 2009 (157) DLT 712. The first feature to be\n       noted is that Roshan Lal deals with a domestic arbitration and,\n       therefore, Section 45 of the A &amp; C Act was not in\n       contemplation. The learned Single Judge, inter alia, concluded\n       that the word „party‟ in Section 8 of the A &amp; C Act refers to a\n       party to the suit in contradistinction to a party to the\n       arbitration agreement.

After considering all the complexities in\n      the case, one of us had concluded in Bharti that a formal\n      application under Section 45 of the A &amp; C Act was not\n      necessary, since it is incumbent for a Court seised of an action\n      in a matter in respect of which the parties have made an\n      arbitration agreement as envisaged in <a href=\"/doc/1513012/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 44</a>, to refer the\n      parties to arbitration except if the Court finds that the said\n      agreement is null and void, inoperative and incapable of being\n      performed. The dismissal of the Suit or the rejection of the\n      application for interim relief under Order XXXIX Rules 1 and 2\n      <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_171\">of the Code of Civil Procedure</a>, 1908 (<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_172\">CPC</a>) has the effect of\n      referring the parties to arbitration. By sagaciously not making\n      a statement under Section 8 of the A &amp; C Act, the Defendant\n      has achieved indirectly what he could not have achieved\n      directly, namely, making it inevitable for the Plaintiff to join\n      arbitral proceedings without any consideration or adjudication\n      of its plea that no arbitration agreement exists between the\n      parties. It is for this reason that it seems to us essential that the\n      Court should have proceeded under <a href=\"/doc/1911494/\" id=\"a_173\">Section 8</a> or Section 45 of\n      the A &amp; C Act, as the case may be and with a view to return a\n      finding on the existence of an arbitration agreement between\n      the parties. If the prima facie finding is in favour of the\n      existence of an arbitration agreement, the Court would rightly\n      leave it to the Arbitral Tribunal to go into and determine the\n      details and the minute objections raised by the Plaintiff. The\n      Court ought not to skirt this issue, as it would tantamount to\n      running counter to the decisions of the Supreme Court in I\n      vaerner, SBP and Sukanya.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">33.9 As noted above, the scope of interference by the Court in an\nInternational Arbitration is limited to the Court determining, whether a valid\narbitration agreement exists between the parties and that the agreement is\nnull and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed and the Court\ncannot, at this stage, enter into a full-fledged inquiry on merits of the matter\nas only a prima facie finding is required to be arrived at.
