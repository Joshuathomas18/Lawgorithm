It is the case of the petitioner that during the course of\nconstruction, it was decided by the Engineer, who was appointed for\nthe project that the respondent was not entitled to payment of\nearthwork for embankment below the original ground level. The\nrespondent raised a dispute towards the decision taken by the\nEngineer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">4.       The Engineer by his letter dated 10th October, 2003 notified\nhis intention to the respondent that for the purposes of making\npayment for the work of embankment, the original ground level will be\nthe level which was given to the respondent before commencement\nof the work of cleaning and grubbing.

Further, the amount which has been awarded in\nfavour of the respondent was alleged to be due since the beginning of\nthe contract only and therefore the price adjustment applicable to the\namount due to the respondent had to be calculated on the basis of\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">OMP No.719/2012                                               Page 3 of 21</span>\n the indices pertaining to each particular interim payment certificates\n(<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_2\">IPC</a>).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">         Similarly, the respondent also made the request before the\nlearned Arbitral Tribunal on 13th April, 2012 by way of letter\nrequesting correction of computational error in the Award dated 18th\nMarch, 2012.

When the petition was listed for hearing before Court, by order\ndated 24th August, 2012, this Court had issued limited notice in the\npetition only confined to the issue of uniform price index for allowing\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">OMP No.719/2012                                        Page 8 of 21</span>\n price escalation payable to the respondent on account of the illegal\nretention of the amounts due to be paid to the respondent for carrying\nout earthwork in embankment as per the contract. The said order has\nnot been challenged by the petitioner. The reply, therefore, is also\nfiled to confine to the said issue only.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">11.     The challenge to the award on the aspect of price adjustment\nis on the allegation that price adjustment has been awarded on the\ncomplete amount of the claim on the basis of price indices prevailing\nat the time of the final bill and that could not have been awarded as\nthe price indices were different for each <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_14\">IPC</a>. Learned counsel for the\npetitioner has submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal failed to appreciate\nthat the meaning of &quot;work&quot; in Clause 305 was synonymous to &quot;Work&quot;\nas defined in Clause 1.1 of the Contract. The &#x27;work&#x27; means the entire\nwork for which the contract was entered into between the parties and\nnot any particular work as held by the Arbitral Tribunal. The work of\nembankment was the first work of construction in the contract, hence,\nthe word &#x27;work&#x27; means the entire construction work and not any\nparticular work, hence, the award being contrary to the only\ninterpretation of the contractual clauses is liable to be set-aside by\nthis Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">12.     It is also submitted by the petitioner that by awarding price\nescalation as per the indices prevailing at the stage of final bill which\ncould not have been awarded in any manner. In para 12.12 of the\nAward, the Arbitral Tribunal has considered the admissible indices as\n57.844% of the R-value and accordingly has applied the same\npercentage on the total amount of the award, i.e. ` 3,07,76,185/-,\nwhich is absolutely incorrect. The amount which has been awarded\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">OMP No.719/2012                                         Page 9 of 21</span>\n in favour of the respondent was alleged to be due since the beginning\nof the contract period and, therefore, the price adjustment applicable\nto the amount allegedly due to the respondent had to be calculated\non the basis of the indices pertaining to each particular <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_15\">IPC</a>. The\nprice adjustment for the amount due under each <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_16\">IPC</a> had to be\npaid on the basis of the price indices at the time of issuance\nof such <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_17\">IPC</a>s and not current price indices existing at the time of the\nfinal bill.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">13.      Having heard the learned counsel for the parties, it is the\nadmitted position that by order dated 24th August, 2012, the limited\nnotice was issued only confined to the issue of uniform price index for\nallowing price escalation payable to the respondent on account of the\nillegal retention of the amounts due to be paid to the respondent for\ncarrying out earthwork in embankment as per the Contract. At that\ntime it was also recorded that the issues of clearing and grubbing and\nearthwork in embankment have already been held against the\npetitioner in similar cases decided by this Court. The further\ncontention, that the respondent approached the Dispute Review\nExpert (DRE) with delay, has also been rightly rejected by this Court.\nTherefore, the issues of clearing and grubbing, earthwork in\nembankment, the decision of DRE have been rightly adjudicated by\nthe Arbitral Tribunal in accordance with the contract between the\nparties and the evidence on record. The said determination by the\nArbitral Tribunal has been upheld by this Court by order dated 24th\nAugust, 2012 whereby the lis between the parties in the present\npetition is reduced to a very narrow compass, viz. relevant applicable\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">OMP No.719/2012                                       Page 10 of 21</span>\n index for price escalation. No appeals against the said order appears\nto have been filed by the petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\">14.     In the reply to the petition, the respondent has stated that\npayments along with the price adjustment were paid by the petitioner\nto the respondent all the way upto <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_18\">IPC</a>-77. As the sum of\n`3,07,76,186/- was wrongly withheld from <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_19\">IPC</a>-78 (final bill) by the\npetitioner, the Arbitral Tribunal rightly applied the cost indices\napplicable at the time of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_20\">IPC</a>-78 for making an award towards price\nadjustment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_23\">15.     It is not disputed that the petitioner has paid the earthwork\nquantity alongwith applicable price adjustment in terms of contract up\nto the penultimate bill (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_21\">IPC</a> 77) which was accepted by the petitioner\nand respondent.     In final bill (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_22\">IPC</a> 78), the petitioner withheld an\namount of `3,07,76,186/- on account of the change in method of\nmeasurement. As the amount was withheld in the final bill (<a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_23\">IPC</a> 78),\nthe corresponding price adjustment payment applicable at the stage\nof the final bill was also withheld. The Arbitral Tribunal had\ndetermined the corresponding price adjustment amount to the\nwithheld amount by applying the cost indices applied by the petitioner\nin <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_24\">IPC</a> 78. Thus, the issue of price adjustment does not arise with\nrespect to the other <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_25\">IPC</a>&#x27;s as alleged by the petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">16.     The price adjustment/escalation under the contract are paid\non various components namely other materials (all commodities),\nlabour, cement, steel (bar &amp; rods), plant and machinery, spares, POL,\nand bitumen. In <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_26\">IPC</a> 78 the petitioner has certified the total escalation\namount on the above components as `2,96,62,320/- for a certified\nwork done value of `5,12,79,520/-. The learned Arbitral Tribunal has\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">OMP No.719/2012                                            Page 11 of 21</span>\n determined the percentage of escalation amount paid in <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_27\">IPC</a> 78 (final\nbill) by dividing the certified escalation amount of `2,96,62,320/- (paid\nby petitioner using escalation formula as per contract) with certified\nvalue of work done of `5,12,79,520/- (R value) which is 2,96,62,320/\n5,12,79,520 x 100 = 57.844%. The sum of the individual escalation\ncomponents added as per the contract formula is 57.844% as well.\nAs the withheld work value of `3,07,76,185/- was made in <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_28\">IPC</a> 78\n(final bill) the corresponding escalation amount applicable to <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_29\">IPC</a> 78\nwas withheld at the rate of 57.844%. The Tribunal while determining\nthe price adjustment, determined the same as `1,78,02,176/- (i.e.\n`3,07,76,185 x 57.844%). Therefore, no interference is called for in\nthe application of the price index by the Tribunal which is apparently\ndone as per the contract and evidence on record available.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">17.     While deciding the price escalation, the Arbitral Tribunal has\napplied the same cost indices as applied by the petitioner at that\nstage (i.e., stage of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_30\">IPC</a> 78 which is the Final Bill). The allegation that\nseparate price indices have to be applied at different stages, whereas\nthe Tribunal adopted a uniform price index in determining the\nescalation permissible is devoid of merit.

In the present case, there is no error in the interpretation of the\ncontract clauses by the Arbitral Tribunal. However even if it were to\nbe assumed, without admitting, that the contention of the petitioner is\ncorrect even then this Court would not interfere with the Arbitral\naward for the reason that it is settled law that an error relatable to\ninterpretation of the contract by an arbitrator is an error within his\njurisdiction.

The findings of the learned Arbitral Tribunal to the issue of\nawarding price escalation as per the indices prevailing at the stage of\nfinal bill are correct findings of fact that are in consonance with the\ncontract between the parties.
