Once the respondent No.1-SJVNL took the position\n\n    that &quot;no validly constituted Disputes Board exists under the terms of the\n\n    Agreement between the parties&quot;, the Applicant became contractually\n\n\n\n    entitled to directly initiate arbitration under Clause 20.8 without waiting\n\n    for the expiry of the 84-day period before the Dispute Board. In any\n\n\n\n\n    event, keeping in view the sanctity of the contractual provisions relating\n\n\n\n\n\n    to the pre-arbitration process and in order to avoid the possibility of any\n\n\n\n\n\n    technical or procedural objections from the respondent No. 1-SJVNL to\n\n    further delay the adjudication of Claim Nos. 37-40, the Applicant\n\n    decided to take a conscious decision of waiting for the said period of\n\n    84-days to expire and issued the Arbitration Notice only thereafter on\n\n    31.01.2020.

Thus the DB is not bound by the 84\n\n     days&#x27; time frame from the date of the reference. It is for this\n\n     reason the DB has categorically issue directions to both the\n\n     parties vide minutes of meeting dated 17-01-2020 &amp;18-01-\n\n\n     2020 for finalizing the DB Procedural Rules of 2009 as the\n\n     current procedural Rules with amendments if any.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_126\">     (xix)   However, instead of finalizing the DB procedural Rules\n\n\n\n\n\n     as mandated by the contract and as directed by the DB in its\n\n     First minutes of meeting dated 18-01-2020, the petitioner has\n\n\n\n\n\n     issued the notice to commence arbitration dated 31-01-2020\n\n     and the present petition is filed.

Clause 20.8 of the GCC provides that i f a dispute arises\n\n    between the parties in connection with, or arising out of, the Contract or\n\n    the execution of the Works and there is no DB in place, whether by\n\n\n    reason of the expiry of the DB&#x27;s appointment or otherwise, the dispute\n\n    may be referred &#x27;directly&#x27; to arbitration under Clause 20.6. Thus, even\n\n\n\n\n    going by the case of the respondent No. 1-SJVNL that there was no DB\n\n\n\n\n\n    in place at the relevant time when that petitioner invoked arbitration, in\n\n    terms of Clause 20.8 of the GCC, the petitioner was well within its right\n\n\n\n\n\n    under the Contract to have invoked arbitration directly, without following\n\n    the steps/procedure contemplated under the other sub-clauses of\n\n    Clause 20 of the Contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_160\">    15.

O n 16.11.2019, the petitioner\n\n    referred the present claim Nos. 37-40 to the DB. However, the\n\n\n\n\n\n    respondent No. 1-SJVNL pointed out that there was no functional\n\n    DB existing at the time of submission of the reference dated\n\n\n\n\n\n    06.11.2019 in absence of execution of the Dispute Board Tripartite\n\n    Agreement which was an essential prerequisite. It is contended on\n\n    behalf of the respondent No.1-SJVNL that as per paragraph 4 of\n\n    Clause 20.2, &#x27;after&#x27; the members are appointed, the DB officially\n\n    comes into existence only after the execution/signing of the Dispute\n\n\n    Board Tripartite Agreement between the parties and each of the\n\n    three members so appointed, and the Agreement has to mandatorily\n\n\n\n\n    incorporate the General Conditions of the Dispute Board Agreement\n\n\n\n\n\n    with such amendments as agreed between all of them. It appears\n\n    that in anticipation that the arbitral proceedings would proceed\n\n\n\n\n\n    before the newly constituted DB, the petitioner, without prejudice to\n\n    its rights and contentions, attended the first meeting dated 17/18-01-\n\n    2020 and even signed the new Tripartite Dispute Board Agreement\n\n    on 18.01.2020 in good faith. However, the respondent No. 1-SJNVL\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">                                           ::: Downloaded on - 12/01/2023 20:29:59 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">                                         49</span>\n\n\n\n    thereafter stated that the procedure for the conduct of hearing before\n\n    the newly constituted DB and the Rules of Procedure of the DB were\n\n    required to be agreed, approved and finalized by the parties and the\n\n\n\n\n                                                              .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_162\">    members of the DB and this was sine qua non for proceeding with\n\n    any claim as envisaged in the DB Agreement. It is contended on\n\n\n\n\n\n    behalf of the respondent No. 1-SJVNL that though there was a need\n\n    for finalization of the DB Procedural Rules in order to proceed further\n\n\n\n\n\n    in the matter, the petitioner did not agree to and approve the draft\n\n    DB Procedural Rules which inter alia provided the timelines within\n\n    which the dispute was to be decided in respect of present claim Nos.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_163\">    37 to 40. It is further contended on behalf of the respondent no. 1-\n\n    SJVNL that Clause 20.4 of the GCC, provides that the dispute is to\n\n\n    be decided either within 84 days from receiving the reference or\n\n    within such other period as may be proposed by the DB and\n\n\n\n\n    approved by both the parties and this is an enabling provision for the\n\n\n\n\n\n    DB to decide its own procedure for settlement of disputes &#x27;beyond&#x27;\n\n    the period of 84 days time limit.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_164\">    16. On behalf of the petitioner, it is contended that the reference to\n\n    the DB was made on 06.11.2019 and in terms of Clause 20.4 of the\n\n    GCC, the DB is required to render its decision in relation to present\n\n    claim Nos. 37 to 40 within 84 days after receiving the reference,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 12/01/2023 20:29:59 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                        50</span>\n\n\n\n    which period expired on 29.11.2020. It is submitted that it is only\n\n    thereafter that the petitioner issued the notice invoking arbitration on\n\n    30.01.2020 and despite the period of 21 days of receipt of the notice\n\n\n\n\n                                                              .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_165\">    invoking arbitration, the respondent No. 1-SJVNL failed to act upon\n\n    the notice.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_166\">    17. Even going by the case of the respondent No. 1-SJVNL, the\n\n    proceedings before the DB cannot proceed unless the DB\n\n\n\n\n\n    Procedural Rules are agreed to and finalized by the parties and the\n\n    members of the DB. As a matter of fact, it is specifically averred by\n\n    the respondent No. 1-SJVNL in the Affidavit-in-reply that the\n\n    formulation and finalization of the DB Procedural Rules is sine qua\n\n    non for proceeding with any claim before the DB as envisaged in the\n\n\n    DB Agreement. It is not in dispute that there is no consensus on the\n\n    terms of the DB Procedural Rules and consequently the draft\n\n\n\n\n    Procedural Rules could not be finalized. There has thus been\n\n\n\n\n\n    deadlock in proceeding before the DB. It is not for this Court to enter\n\n    into a mini-trial to determine which party is at fault for not agreeing to\n\n\n\n\n\n    the terms of the DB Procedural Rules. That, in any event, would not\n\n    serve any purpose, when it is conceded before the Court that the\n\n    parties and the members of DB are required to agree and there has\n\n    to be a consensus in the DB Procedural Rules. Even otherwise,\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                             ::: Downloaded on - 12/01/2023 20:29:59 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                        51</span>\n\n\n\n    given the limited jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, it is not\n\n    possible to adjudicate upon the rival factual issues raised by the\n\n    parties in relation to the finalization of the DB Procedural Rules to be\n\n\n\n\n                                                             .\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_167\">    adopted by the parties and the members of the DB. More than 3\n\n    years have elapsed since the petitioner had made a reference to the\n\n\n\n\n\n    DB on 06.11.2019.

In absence of the DB Procedural Rules being finalized, there is\n\n    no functional DB in operation even till date despite the execution of\n\n    the Dispute Board Tripartite Agreement on 18-01-2020. This is the\n\n    contention of the respondent No.1-SJVNL itself. There is thus no\n\n    merit in the contention on behalf of the respondent no. 1-SJVNL that\n\n\n    even if is assumed that the petitioner did make a valid reference\n\n    dated 06-11-2019, the 84 days time limit got over on 29-01-2020, but\n\n\n\n\n    before the expiry of the said period, the petitioner willingly signed the\n\n\n\n\n\n    fresh DB Tripartite Agreement dated 18-01-2020 and had thus\n\n    conceded to the new process initiated by the DB through its first\n\n\n\n\n\n    meeting dated 17/18-01-2020 in respect of present claim nos. 37 to\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_169\">    40.

Quite apart of the above, it is an admitted position before the\n\n    Court that the petitioner had earlier filed an Application being\n\n    Arbitration Case No. 3 of 2019 in this Court seeking appointment of\n\n    the 3rd Arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act for adjudication of\n\n    disputes in relation to Claim Nos. 27-36 between the same parties,\n\n\n\n    under the same contract and same project.

If the interest that he has in the outcome of\n        the dispute, is taken to be the basis for the possibility\n\n\n        of bias, it will always be present irrespective of\n        whether the matter stands under the first or second\n        category of cases. We are conscious that if such\n\n\n\n\n        deduction is drawn from the decision of this Court in\n        TRF Limited, 2017 8 SCC 377 , all cases having\n\n\n\n\n\n        clauses similar to that with which we are presently\n        concerned, a party to the agreement would be\n\n\n\n\n\n        disentitled to make any appointment of an Arbitrator\n        on its own and it would always be available to argue\n        that a party or an official or an authority having\n        interest in the dispute would be disentitled to make\n        appointment of an Arbitrator.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">        21.     But, in our view that has to be the logical\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_123\">                                      ::: Downloaded on - 12/01/2023 20:29:59 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_124\">                                 58</span>\n\n\n\n        deduction from TRF Limited, 2017 8 SCC 377 .\n        Paragraph 50 of the decision shows that this Court\n        was   concerned     with     the   issue,    &quot;whether      the\n        Managing Director, after becoming ineligible by\n\n\n\n\n                                                        .\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">        operation of law, is he still eligible to nominate an\n        Arbitrator&quot; The ineligibility referred to therein, was as\n        a result of operation of law, in that a person having\n\n\n\n\n\n        an interest in the dispute or in the outcome or\n        decision thereof, must not only be ineligible to act as\n        an arbitrator but must also not be eligible to appoint\n\n\n\n\n\n        anyone else as an arbitrator and that such person\n        cannot and should not have any role in charting out\n        any course to the dispute resolution by having the\n\n        power to appoint an arbitrator. The next sentences in\n\n        the paragraph, further show that cases where both\n        the parties could nominate respective arbitrators of\n        their choice were found to be completely a different\n\n\n        situation.   The   reason     is   clear    that   whatever\n        advantage a party may derive by nominating an\n        arbitrator of its choice would get counter balanced by\n\n\n\n\n        equal power with the other party. But, in a case\n        where only one party has a right to appoint a sole\n\n\n\n\n\n        arbitrator, its choice will always have an element of\n        exclusivity in determining or charting the course for\n\n\n\n\n\n        dispute resolution. Naturally, the person who has an\n        interest in the outcome or decision of the dispute\n        must not have the power to appoint a sole arbitrator.\n        That has to be taken as the essence of the\n        amendments brought in by the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_21\">Arbitration and\n        Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015</a> (Act 3 of 2016)\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_125\">                                       ::: Downloaded on - 12/01/2023 20:29:59 :::CIS</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_126\">                                        59</span>\n\n\n\n                 and recognised by the decision of this Court in TRF\n                 Limited.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_185\">    27.
