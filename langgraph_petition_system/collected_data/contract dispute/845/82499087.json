The suit, as noted above has been filed by the Plaintiff for\n\n recovery of the amount in respect of the services rendered by the\n\n Plaintiff to the Defendants under the said contract agreement dated 21 st\n\n October, 2011. Pursuant to negotiations, the Defendants sent a\n\n communication dated 17th November, 2017 to the Plaintiff, whereby\n\n the outstanding amount of Rs. 2,93,99,077/- was agreed by the\n\n Defendants to be paid to the Plaintiff in the installments mentioned\n\n therein. It is an admitted position that pursuant to the said\n\n understanding the Defendants made payments to the Plaintiff of a total\n\n sum of Rs. 1,35,00,000/- leaving an outstanding of Rs. 1,58,99,077/-.\n\n It is in respect of this amount that the Plaintiffs have filed the captioned\n\n suit as a summary suit on the basis of the settlement dated 17 th\n\n November, 2017.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\"><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> Nikita Gadgil                                                                  6/18</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">::: Uploaded on - 27/12/2023                   ::: Downloaded on - 29/02/2024 23:44:30 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">                                       8.

A perusal of the dispute resolution clause in the contract dated\n\n 21st October, 2011 indicates that if the dispute if not resolved through\n\n friendly consultations, then the dispute is to be referred to arbitration.\n\n Clause 19.3 of the said contract clearly records the agreement that both\n\n the parties will not institute any legal proceedings against the other\n\n arising out of or in connection with the agreement except for the\n\n purposes of enforcing any award in any Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\"> 11.      It has been argued on behalf of the Plaintiff that the settlement\n\n arrived at between the Plaintiff and Defendants on 17 th November,\n\n 2017 is a new contract and that the said new contract does not contain\n\n any arbitration clause and therefore, the suit is maintainable on the\n\n basis of the acknowledgment of debt under the said settlement.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_25\"> 12.      I am afraid, I am unable to agree with the submissions made on\n\n behalf of the Plaintiff. As noted above, Clause 19 of the said contract\n\n clearly provides how disputes between the two parties are to be\n\n resolved and that is by referring the dispute to arbitration. A perusal of\n\n clause 19 and clause 19.3 of the said contract agreement dated 21 st\n\n October, 2011 in particular, clearly suggests that the parties have\n\n categorically agreed to refer any dispute to arbitration and also agreed\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\"> Nikita Gadgil                                                                   7/18</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">::: Uploaded on - 27/12/2023                    ::: Downloaded on - 29/02/2024 23:44:30 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">                                      8.

A look at page 45 of the Plaint, which contains the settlement\n\n dated 17th November, 2017, which again clearly indicates that if due to\n\n any reason the Defendant fails to fulfill its commitment, then the\n\n Plaintiffs shall have all the rights to take appropriate legal action and\n\n that the demand notice dated 13th October, 2017 will not be acted\n\n upon. The demand notice dated 13 th October, 2017 refers to the action\n\n that was threatened by the Plaintiffs against the Defendants under the\n\n Insolvency and Bankruptcy Code. Reference to appropriate legal action,\n\n to my mind, would refer to the action as contained in the contract to\n\n resolve disputes between the parties. The settlement dated 17 th\n\n November, 2017 arises out of the said contract dated 21 st October, 2011\n\n and in respect of any dispute arising out of the said contract, the parties\n\n have agreed not to institute legal proceedings but to refer the dispute\n\n to the arbitration. The settlement dated 17 th November, 2017 by no\n\n stretch of imagination can be said to be an independent settlement or a\n\n new contract between the parties extinguishing the said contract.\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> Nikita Gadgil                                                                  8/18</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">::: Uploaded on - 27/12/2023                   ::: Downloaded on - 29/02/2024 23:44:30 :::</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">                                        8.

It is also pertinent to refer to some of the Clauses in the plaint,\n\n pursuant to which the Plaintiff has filed the captioned suit. Paragraph\n\n 12 of the Plaint clearly records that as on 18 th December, 2020 an\n\n amount of Rs. 1,58,99,077/- was due and payable by the Defendants to\n\n the Plaintiff under the said contract, arrangement dated 17 th November,\n\n 2017 and also under the cheques. Even paragraph 17 which pertains to\n\n the jurisdiction of this Court to entertain, try and dispose of the suit\n\n refers to the fact that the contract was entered into at Mumbai. In my\n\n view, the suit is based on the contract as well as on the settlement\n\n arrived at between the parties on 17 th November, 2017 pursuant to the\n\n said contract dated 21st October, 2011 and cheques issued thereafter,\n\n which allegedly have been dishonoured.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_32\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"150062000\" id=\"span_20\">15.
