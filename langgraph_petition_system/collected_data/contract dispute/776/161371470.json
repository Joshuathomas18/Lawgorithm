The\n                                step must be such as to manifest the intention of the party\n                                unequivocally to abandon the right under the arbitration\n                                agreement and instead to opt to have the dispute resolved on\n                                merits in the suit.

A perusal of the above quoted clause shows that the\n                                parties to the agreement were not sure or determined at the\n                                time of the sale contract about reference of the dispute to\n                                arbitration. While reading the words ―Arbitration if any‖ in\n                                the clause it appears that the parties were yet to decide\n                                whether the future disputes between them were to be referred\n                                or not. Where there is merely a possibility of the parties\n                                agreeing to arbitration in future as contrasted with an\n                                obligation to refer disputes to arbitration, there would be no\n                                valid and binding arbitration agreement as per settled law.\n                                The words used in a said clause should disclose a\n                                determination and obligation to go to arbitration and not\n                                merely the contemplation of the possibility of going to\n                                arbitration. It appears that the said clause of arbitration is\n                                vague and uncertain and cannot be the basis for arbitration\n                                or binding on the parties as is clear from the language in\n                                which the clause is couched.

Order 14 Rule 2 provides for disposal of a suit on a\n                            preliminary issue and under sub-rule (2) of Rule 2, if the\n                            court is of opinion that a case or part thereof can be\n                            disposed of on an issue of law only, it may try that issue first,\n                            in case it relates to jurisdiction of the court or bar to\n                            entertaining the suit.

The whole purpose of trial on preliminary issue is to save\n                            time and money. Though it is not a mini trial, the court can\n                            and has to look into the entire pleadings and the materials\n                            available on record, to the extent not in dispute. But that is\n                            not the situation as far as the enquiry under Order 7 Rule 11\n                            is concerned. That is only on institutional defects. The court\n                            can only see whether the plaint, or rather the pleadings of\n                            the plaintiff, constitute a cause of action. Pleadings in the\n                            sense where, even after the stage of written statement, if\n                            there is a replication filed, in a given situation the same also\n                            can be looked into to see whether there is any admission on\n                            the part of the plaintiff. In other words, under Order 7 Rule\n                            11, the court has to take a decision looking at the pleadings\n                            of the plaintiff only and not on the rebuttal made by the\n                            defendant or any other materials produced by the\n                            defendant.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">                      ANALYSIS AND FINDINGS\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_65\">                      50.

It is the case of the appellant that the learned Trial Court erred in\n                      passing the impugned order as it failed to take into consideration that the\n                      order dated 9th May, 2024 cannot be taken as an arbitral award under the\n                      Act. The appellant contends that the impugned order, passed by the\n                      learned Trial Court, is legally unsound and should be set aside as it fails\n                      to consider the complete facts and circumstances of the case. It has been\n                      submitted that the learned Trial Court identified the order dated 9 th May\n                      2024, issued by the ESC, as an arbitration award, despite Clause 19.4 of\n                      the Agreement executed between the appellant and respondent No. 1,\n                      which explicitly states that „there will be no arbitration for settlement of\n                      any dispute between the parties.‟\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_67\">                      52.   The appellant further asserts that the learned Trial Court\n                      misinterpreted the aforesaid Clause and incorrectly concluded that prior\n                      to the year 2007, the appellant treated ESC orders as arbitral awards,\n                      neglecting the true intent of the Agreement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_68\">                      53.   The appellant further submits that the learned Trial Court ought to\n                      have adjudicated the civil suit based on its facts and circumstances,\n                      instead of disregarding the terms of the Agreement in totality. It is argued\n                      that under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_47\">Order VII Rule 11 of the CPC</a>, the learned Trial Court is\n                      required to consider only the averments in the plaint when deciding on an\n                      application. However, the appellant contends that the learned Trial Court\n                      wrongly invoked this provision, as a plain reading of the plaint reveals\n                      that the suit is not barred by law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_69\">                      54.

The appellant argues that Clause 19.4 of the\n                      Agreement prohibits arbitration and does not mention any alternative\n                      dispute resolution methods, making the learned Trial Court&#x27;s reliance on\n                      this provision unjustified. Lastly, the appellant has submitted that the\n                      learned Trial Court overlooked the fact that as per the MOU between the\n                      Governments of Haryana and Delhi, the respondent No. 2 was\n                      responsible for payment for the work completed by respondent No. 1 and\n                      that it was the actions of respondent No. 2 that led to the stoppage of\n                      work, and thus, any damages incurred by the respondent No. 1 should be\n                      borne solely by respondent No. 2.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">                      55.   In rival submissions, the case of the appellant has been completely\n                      refuted by the respondents to the effect that the appellant entered into an\n                      Agreement with the respondent No. 1 for the concrete lining of Delhi Sub\n                      Branch, which included an arbitration clause under Clause 28. However,\n                      the appellant allegedly removed this clause when filing the appeal,\n                      intending to conceal material facts from the Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_71\">                      56.   The respondent No. 1 has alleged that the appellant has concealed\n                      vital facts by not submitting a complete set of documents, despite filing a\n                      certificate claiming that all relevant documents were attached.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_72\">                      57.   Furthermore, the appellant also failed to produce records, as\n                      directed by the learned Trial Court, regarding the procedures followed\n                      before the year 2007 in execution of the decisions passed by the ESC.\n                      Moreover, the respondent No. 1, through an RTI dated 21st May, 2019,\n                      obtained information from the Irrigation Department of Haryana, which\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">                      RFA 171/2022                                                      Page 26 of 41</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">By:GAURAV SHARMA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">Signing Date:23.08.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">19:12:18</span>\n                       revealed that since 1st March, 2007, Clause 19 of the Agreement provided\n                      a dispute redressal mechanism. The response provided via a letter dated\n                      26th July, 2019 indicated that prior to the year 2007, decision of the ESC\n                      were treated as awards and were executable under the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_73\">                      58.      It has been submitted on behalf of the respondent No. 1 that in the\n                      year 2007, changes were made to the arbitration procedures, but the\n                      fundamental nature of the ESC, the orders passed by it, and the\n                      applicability of the Act remained unchanged.

In the present\n                           case, though there has been a provision of appeal as\n                           reflected from clause 19 of work contract. However, prior to\n                           2007 such orders have been considered as an arbitration\n                           despite this fact. There has been some changes in such terms\n                           and conditions, however, constitution of such committee,\n                           redressal of grievances and provision of appeal remains\n                           same. Therefore, in the light of above discussion as well as\n                           facts and circumstances of the case I am of opinion that by\n                           virtue of Clause 19 of the work contract, it provides for a\n                           mechanism of redressal of dispute by virtue of which\n                           jurisdiction of general civil courts is excluded. There is no\n                           provision reflected besides the construction of clause 19 of\n                           work contract that if such disputes are not redressed by the\n                           committee then can also be agitated before and redressed by\n                           the general civil court. Thus, clause 19 of the work contract\n                           is in the nature of a provision providing for arbitration.\n                           Approach of plaintiff, prior to and after 2007 is very much\n                           indicating towards that. Thus, the conduct of parties, more\n                           particularly, plaintiff matters here. Thus, none of the\n                           judgements relied upon by the plaintiff are applicable here.\n                           As per <a href=\"/doc/76869205/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 9</a> and <a href=\"/doc/66488754/\" id=\"a_72\">89</a> CPC read with <a href=\"/doc/1091250/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 5</a> of\n                           Arbitration Act, in my considered opinion jurisdiction of\n                           General Civil Court is therefore, barred. I am further of the\n                           opinion that, in such circumstances only the special\n                           provisions as laid down under <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_74\">Arbitration Act</a> 1996 i.e.\n                           <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_75\">Sections 34</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1912867/\" id=\"a_76\">35</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1286256/\" id=\"a_77\">36</a> can be resorted to. In these\n                           circumstances, therefore, in my considered opinion\n                           preliminary issue is decided in favour of defendant Nos.1\n                           and 2, that there exist an Arbitration Agreement as per work\n                           contract by virtue of its &#x27;Clause 19&#x27;. If such clause 19 is\n                           providing the provision of arbitration in between the parties,\n                           therefore, as per <a href=\"/doc/76869205/\" id=\"a_78\">Section 9</a> CPC r/w <a href=\"/doc/1091250/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 5</a> Arbitration\n                           Act jurisdiction of general civil court is barred.\n                           With regard to the plea of privity of contract between\n                           defendant No.1 and 2, I am of the opinion that plea of privity\n                           of contract is nothing but defence of defendants which\n                           cannot be considered under <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_80\">Order VII Rule 11 CPC</a> though\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_201\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_202\">                      RFA 171/2022                                                    Page 32 of 41</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_203\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">By:GAURAV SHARMA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">Signing Date:23.08.2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">19:12:18</span>\n                              it is relevant otherwise.

The\n                      respondents/defendants, however, contended that the ESC‟s decision was\n                      an arbitration award, barring the Civil Court‟s jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1091250/\" id=\"a_84\">Section\n                      5</a> of the Act, and that the prayers made in the suit were contradictory, and\n                      lacked privity of contract between the defendant/respondent Nos. 1 and 2.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">                      63.

This Court also deems it fit to state that a bare reading of the\n                      clauses of the Agreement and its interpretation do not make out a case\n                      that the procedure of arbitration is to be followed, and proving the same\n                      would require proper trial.

The judgments relied upon by this Court clearly shows that in order\n                      to accept a valid arbitration agreement, the wording of the concerned\n                      clause must show, in clear and categorical words, that there will be an\n                      arbitration. However, the facts of the instant case are in complete\n                      contradiction to the settled position of law due to the contradictory\n                      clauses and uncertainty about the procedure to be adopted against a\n                      decision of ESC etc.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_102\">                      76.

Moreover,\n                      the learned Trial Court erred in deciding the preliminary issue in haste as\n                      prima facie, the suit seems to be maintainable because unless the shadow\n                      caste upon the existence and terms of arbitration is decided, allowing the\n                      preliminary issue is only against the law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_105\">                      79.   Further, the learned Trial Court erred in passing the impugned\n                      order based on the submission of the respondents that till the year 2007,\n                      all such orders of ESC were considered in the form of an award and it\n                      was executable as per the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_106\">                      80.   This Court is also of the view that the learned Trial Court erred in\n                      law by considering the contention of the respondents that in the year,\n                      2007 certain changes have taken place in the procedure adopted by the\n                      plaintiff, however, the nature of such committee and passing of this order\n                      and applicability of Act upon its order has not changed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_107\">                      81.
