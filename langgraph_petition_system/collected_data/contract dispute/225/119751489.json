After due negotiations, the Contract was\n     executed and signed on 27.03.2012.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">3.   The dispute between the parties arose in relation to the alleged wrongful\n     encashment of warranty bond by the respondent. The respondent vide its\n     letter dated 16.02.2016, directed the Joint Chief Executive Officer, State\n     Bank of India, Frankfurt Branch, Germany to encash the WBG No. 12/380\n     for its full value i.e., Euro 201,793.75 and remit the amount through direct\n     bank transfer to the Principal Controller of Defence Account (PCDA,\n     Government account) in accordance with the details stated in the letter.\n     One copy of the letter dated 16.02.2016 was also forwarded to the\n     petitioner. This action on the part of the respondent, i.e., of encashing\n     Liquidated Damages (LDs) for the requisite amount was on account of\n     delay in the supply of goods beyond the contractual time period.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_6\">4.   The respondent, vide its letter dated 24.02.2016, informed the Petitioner\n     that the subject instructions for WBG encashment had been issued after\n     due scrutiny and analysis of the case put up by the Petitioner vide letter\n     dated 24.10.2014 and such encashment was with approval of the\n     competent authority at Ministry of Defence. The respondent was also\n     accorded sanction by the President of India to deduct Euro 197,230.35\n     towards the recovery of applicable LDs from the Petitioner in accordance\n     with the terms of the Contract vide letter dated 11.08.2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.

Despite the aforesaid, the parties continued to engage themselves in\n     “bilateral discussions” with a view to explore the possibility of resolving\n     the dispute regarding imposition of the LDs and encashment of the WBG.\n     However, the respondent vide its letter dated 22.09.2017 informed the\n     petitioner, that all actions taken by the respondent were in accordance with\n     the terms of the Contract, and that the petitioner was given sufficient\n     opportunity to present its case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">7.   The petitioner claims that after the letter dated 22.09.2017 was issued, the\n     parties remained in constant communication with each other, to negotiate\n     and resolve the dispute. Nonetheless, the petitioner vide letter dated\n     04.09.2019, requested the respondent to review and discuss the wrongful\n     imposition of LDS and give a fair chance to the petitioner to present its\n     case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">8.

According to the learned counsel, the aforestated is one of the\n      distinguishing features of the Contract in question as in defence\n      procurement contracts, it would be in the interest of the parties to resolve\n      the disputes if any by way of ‘bilateral discussions’ rather than by\n      initiating arbitration proceedings. The learned counsel submitted that the\n      respondent for the first time informed the petitioner by letter dated\n      22.09.2017 that the proposal put forward by the petitioner to reconsider\n      the decision of wrongful deduction of LD and encashment of bank\n      guarantee was rejected.

Mere failure or inaction to pay\ndoes not lead to the inference about the existence of a dispute as the expression\n“dispute” contains a positive element of assertion and in denying and merely an\ninaction to accede to a claim or a request.

The Court then went on to\nobserve that it was also true that a party cannot postpone the accrual of a cause\nof action by writing letters or sending reminders but where the bill had been\nfinally prepared, the claim made by the claimant is the accrual of the cause of\naction. For a proper understanding of the ratio in the aforesaid judgment, we\nreproduce hereinbelow para 4 of the judgment in its entirety.

Therefore, in order to be entitled to order of reference under\n       <a href=\"/doc/1453009/\" id=\"a_63\">S. 20</a>, it is necessary that there should be an arbitration agreement\n       and secondly, difference must arise to which this agreement\n       applied. In this case, there is no dispute that there was an\n       arbitration agreement. There has been an assertion of claim by the\n       appellant and silence as well as refusal in respect of the same by\n       respondent. Therefore, a dispute has arisen regarding non-\n       payment of the alleged dues of the appellant. The question is for\n       the present case when did such dispute arise. The High Court\n       proceeded on the basis that the work was completed in 1980 and,\n       therefore, the appellant became entitled to the payment from that\n       date and the cause of action under <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_64\">Art. 137</a> arose from that date.\n       But in order to be entitled to ask for a reference under<a href=\"/doc/1453009/\" id=\"a_65\"> S. 20</a> of the\n       Act there must not only be an entitlement to money but there must\n       be a difference or a dispute must arise. It is true that on\n       completion of the work a right to get payment would normally\n       arise but where the final bills as in this case have not been\n       prepared as appears from the record and when the assertion of the\n       claim was made on 28th Feb. 1983 and there was non-payment,\n       the cause of action from that date, that is to say, 28th of Feb. 1983.\n       It is also true that a party cannot postpone the accrual of cause of\n       action by writing reminders or sending reminders but where the\n       bill had not been finally prepared, the claim made by a claimant\n       is the accrual of the cause of action. A dispute arises where there\n       is a claim and a denial and repudiation of the claim.

Three principles of law are discernible from the aforesaid decision of this\n      Court. First, ordinarily on the completion of the work, the right to receive\n      the payment begins. Secondly, a dispute arises when there is a claim on\n      one side and its denial/repudiation by the other and thirdly, a person\n      cannot postpone the accrual of cause of action by repeatedly writing\n      letters or sending reminders. In other words, ‘bilateral discussions’ for\n      an indefinite period of time would not save the situation so far as the\n      accrual of cause of action and the right to apply for appointment of\n      arbitrator is concerned.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">38.   In Union of India and Another v. M/s L. K. Ahuja and Co., reported in\n      (1988) 3 SCC 76, this Court in paras 6 and 8 respectively of the judgment\n      has laid down the ratio with regard to the limitation period applicable in\n      arbitration proceeding. Paras 6 and 8 respectively read as under:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1229716\" id=\"span_26\">“6. It appears that these questions were discussed in the decision\n       of the Calcutta High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1229716/\" id=\"a_69\">Jiwnani Engineering Works Pvt. Ltd.\n       v. Union of India</a> [AIR 1978 Cal 228] where one of us (Sabyasachi\n       Mukharji, J.) was a party and which held after discussing all these\n       authorities that the question whether the claim sought to be raised\n       was barred by limitation or not, was not relevant for an order\n       under <a href=\"/doc/1453009/\" id=\"a_70\">Section 20</a> of the Act. Therefore, there are two aspects. One\n       is whether the claim made in the arbitration is barred by limitation\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                                                                                 17</span>\n\f       under the relevant provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_71\">Limitation Act</a> and secondly,\n       whether the claim made for application under <a href=\"/doc/1453009/\" id=\"a_72\">Section 20</a> is barred.\n       In order to be a valid claim for reference under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_73\">Section 20</a> of the\n       Arbitration Act, 1940, it is necessary that there should be an\n       arbitration agreement and secondly differences must arise to\n       which the agreement in question applied and, thirdly, that must be\n       within time as stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/1453009/\" id=\"a_74\">Section 20</a> of the Act.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">                   xxx                 xxx                        xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"20683\" id=\"span_28\">8. In view of the well settled principles we are of the view that it\n       will be entirely a wrong to mix up the two aspects, namely, whether\n       there was any valid claim for reference under <a href=\"/doc/1453009/\" id=\"a_75\">Section 20</a> of the Act\n       and, secondly, whether the claim to be adjudicated by the\n       arbitrator, was barred by lapse of time. The second is a matter\n       which the arbitrator would decide unless, however, if on admitted\n       facts a claim is found at the time of making an order under <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_76\">Section\n       20</a> of the Arbitration Act, to be barred by limitation. In order to be\n       entitled to ask for a reference under <a href=\"/doc/1453009/\" id=\"a_77\">Section 20</a> of the Act, there\n       must be an entitlement to money and a difference or dispute in\n       respect of the same. It is true that on completion of the work, right\n       to get payment would normally arise and it is also true that on\n       settlement of the final bill, the right to get further payment gets\n       weakened but the claim subsists and whether it does subsist, is a\n       matter which is arbitrable. In this case the claim for reference was\n       made within three years commencing from April 16, 1976 and the\n       application was filed on December 13, 1976. We are, therefore, of\n       the view that the High Court was right in this case. See in this\n       connection the observations of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/20683/\" id=\"a_78\">Inder Singh\n       Rekhi v. D.D.A.</a> [(1988) 2 SCC 338]”\n                                                     (Emphasis supplied)</span>\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">39.   One would thus see that in L.K. Ahuja (supra) the Court was dealing with\n      the twin aspects, one whether the claim made in the arbitration was barred\n      by law of limitation under the relevant provisions of the relevant Act, and\n      secondly whether the application under <a href=\"/doc/1453009/\" id=\"a_79\">Section 20</a> of the Act 1940 was\n      barred by limitation. In order to be a valid claim with reference to <a href=\"/doc/1154330/\" id=\"a_80\">Section\n      28</a> of the Act 1940 it is necessary that there should be an arbitration\n      agreement, secondly, the differences must arise to which the agreement in\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                                                               18</span>\n\f      question applies and thirdly that application must be within time as\n      stipulated in <a href=\"/doc/1453009/\" id=\"a_81\">Section 20</a> of the Act 1940. With reference to the limitation\n      aspect the Court found that the assertion of claim and denial of the same\n      was a necessary ingredient and then went on to say that it would be wrong\n      to mix up the two aspects, namely, whether there was any valid claim for\n      reference under <a href=\"/doc/1453009/\" id=\"a_82\">Section 20</a> of the Act 1940 and whether the claim to be\n      adjudicated by the Arbitrator was barred by lapse of time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"640382\" id=\"span_30\">40.   On the aspect whether the decision on the issue of limitation should be\n      decided at the stage of passing of an order referring the disputes to the\n      arbitrator, this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/640382/\" id=\"a_83\">J.C. Budhraja v. Chairman, Orissa\n      Mining Corporation Ltd. and Another</a>, reported in (2008) 2 SCC\n      444 has drawn a fine distinction between the period of limitation for\n      filing of a petition and as to the claims being barred by time.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"640382\" id=\"span_31\">We quote\n      the relevant observations made by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/640382/\" id=\"a_84\">J.C. Budhraja</a> (supra) in\n      paras 25 and 26 respectively, as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">       “25. The learned counsel for the appellant submitted that the\n       limitation would begin to run from the date on which a difference\n       arose between the parties, and in this case the difference arose\n       only when OMC refused to comply with the notice dated 4-6-1980\n       seeking reference to arbitration. We are afraid, the contention is\n       without merit. The appellant is obviously confusing the limitation\n       for a petition under <a href=\"/doc/411664/\" id=\"a_85\">Section 8(2)</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1940 with\n       the limitation for the claim itself. The limitation for a suit is\n       calculated as on the date of filing of the suit. In the case of\n       arbitration, limitation for the claim is to be calculated on the date\n       on which the arbitration is deemed to have commenced.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">       26. <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_86\">Section 37(3)</a> of the Act provides that for the purpose of the\n       <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_87\">Limitation Act</a>, an arbitration is deemed to have been commenced\n       when one party to the arbitration agreement serves on the other\n       party thereto, a notice requiring the appointment of an arbitrator.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_56\">       Such a notice having been served on 4-6-1980, it has to be seen\n       whether the claims were in time as on that date. If the claims were\n       barred on 4-6-1980, it follows that the claims had to be rejected\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                                                               19</span>\n\f       by the arbitrator on the ground that the claims were barred by\n       limitation. The said period has nothing to do with the period of\n       limitation for filing a petition under <a href=\"/doc/996339/\" id=\"a_88\">Section 8(2)</a> of the Act. Insofar\n       as a petition under <a href=\"/doc/996339/\" id=\"a_89\">Section 8(2)</a> is concerned, the cause of action\n       would arise when the other party fails to comply with the notice\n       invoking arbitration. Therefore, the period of limitation for filing\n       a petition under <a href=\"/doc/996339/\" id=\"a_90\">Section 8(2)</a> seeking appointment of an arbitrator\n       cannot be confused with the period of limitation for making a\n       claim.

Having perused through the relevant precedents, we agree\n       that on a certain set of facts and circumstances, the period during\n       which the parties were bona fide negotiating towards an amicable\n       settlement may be excluded for the purpose of computing the\n       period of limitation for reference to arbitration under the 1996 Act.\n       However, in such cases the entire negotiation history between the\n       parties must be specifically pleaded and placed on the record. The\n       Court upon careful consideration of such history must find out\n       what was the “breaking point” at which any reasonable party\n       would have abandoned efforts at arriving at a settlement and\n       contemplated referral of the dispute for arbitration. This\n       “breaking point” would then be treated as the date on which the\n       cause of action arises, for the purpose of limitation. The threshold\n       for determining when such a point arises will be lower in the case\n       of commercial disputes, where the party&#x27;s primary interest is in\n       securing the payment due to them, than in family disputes where it\n       may be said that the parties have a greater stake in settling the\n       dispute amicably, and therefore delaying formal adjudication of\n       the claim.\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                                               21</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">\f       29. Moreover, in a commercial dispute, while mere failure to pay\n       may not give rise to a cause of action, once the applicant has\n       asserted their claim and the respondent fails to respond to such\n       claim, such failure will be treated as a denial of the applicant&#x27;s\n       claim giving rise to a dispute, and therefore the cause of action for\n       reference to arbitration. It does not lie to the applicant to plead\n       that it waited for an unreasonably long period to refer the dispute\n       to arbitration merely on account of the respondent&#x27;s failure to\n       settle their claim and because they were writing representations\n       and reminders to the respondent in the meanwhile.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">44.   The aforesaid observations make it very clear that what is important for\n      the Court is to find out what was the “Breaking Point” at which any\n      reasonable party would have abandoned efforts at arriving at a settlement\n      and contemplated referral of the dispute for arbitration.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"109178821\" id=\"span_40\">45.   The learned counsel appearing for the petitioner has placed strong\n      reliance on para 28 of <a href=\"/doc/109178821/\" id=\"a_98\">Geo Miller</a> (supra) to fortify her submission that\n      the “Breaking Point” was sometime in September, 2019 and not in 2016\n      as asserted by the respondent. What was the “Breaking Point” is a\n      question of fact and we shall deal with this issue a little later. However,\n      para 28 <a href=\"/doc/109178821/\" id=\"a_99\">referred to above</a> should be read along with the observations\n      made by this Court in para 21 of the judgment.

This has not been\n       disputed by the appellant. Hence the limitation period ended on\n       10-8-1992. Since the appellant served notice for appointment of\n       arbitrator in 2002, and requested the appointment of an arbitrator\n       before a court only by the end of 2003, his claim is clearly barred\n       by limitation.”\n                                                    (Emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"109178821\" id=\"span_42\">46.

Since there is no provision in\nthe Act 1996 specifying the period of limitation for filing an application\nunder <a href=\"/doc/438099/\" id=\"a_114\">Section 11</a>, one would have to take recourse to the Act 1963, as per\n<a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_115\">Section 43</a> of the Act 1996 which provides that the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_116\">Limitation Act</a> shall\napply to arbitrators, as it applies to proceedings in Court.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">Since none of the articles in <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_117\">Schedule to the Limitation Act</a> provide a\ntime period for filing an application for appointment of arbitrator under\n<a href=\"/doc/438099/\" id=\"a_118\">Section 11</a>, it would be covered by the residual provision under <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_119\">Article\n137</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_120\">Limitation Act</a> which provides that the period of limitation is\nthree years for any other application for which no period of limitation is\nprovided elsewhere in the division.

This Court held that an application under <a href=\"/doc/438099/\" id=\"a_121\">Section 11</a> is to be\nfiled in a Court of Law, and since no specific Article of the Act 1963\napplies, the residual Article would become applicable.

Applying the law to the facts of the present case, it is clear\n that this is a case where the claims are ex facie time-barred by over\n 5½ years, since Nortel did not take any action whatsoever after\n the rejection of its claim by BSNL on 4-8-2014. The notice of\n arbitration was invoked on 29-4-2020.

In the present case, the notice invoking arbitration was issued\n 5½ years after rejection of the claims on 4-8-2014. Consequently,\n the notice invoking arbitration is ex facie time-barred, and the\n disputes between the parties cannot be referred to arbitration in\n the facts of this case.”\n\n\nAmendment required\n\nHowever, this Court in the above said case observed that since there is\nvacuum in the law to provide a period of limitation under <a href=\"/doc/438099/\" id=\"a_136\">Section 11</a> of\nthe Act 1996 the Courts have taken recourse to the position that the\nlimitation period would be governed by <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_137\">Article 137</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_138\">Limitation Act,\n1963</a> which provides a period of three years from the date when the right\nto apply accrues. This Court considered this as an unduly long period for\nfiling an application under <a href=\"/doc/438099/\" id=\"a_139\">Section 11</a>, since it would defeat the very\nobject of the Act 1996, which provides for expeditious resolution of\ncommercial disputes within a time bound period. <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_140\">The Act</a> has been\namended in 2015 and 2019 respectively to provide for further time limits\nto ensure that the arbitration proceedings are conducted and concluded\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">                                                                        28</span>\n\f      expeditiously. Section 29A mandates that the arbitral tribunal will\n      conclude the proceedings within a period of 18 months. In view of the\n      legislative intent, the period of 3 years for filing an application under\n      <a href=\"/doc/438099/\" id=\"a_141\">Section 11</a> would run contrary to the scheme of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_82\">      This Court, therefore, considered it necessary for the Parliament to effect\n      an amendment to <a href=\"/doc/438099/\" id=\"a_142\">Section 11</a> of the Act 1996, prescribing a specific\n      period of limitation within which a party may move the court for making\n      an application for appointment of arbitrators under <a href=\"/doc/438099/\" id=\"a_143\">Section 11</a> of the Act.\n      [Reference:     Article titled as ‘Limitation for Filing Application for\n      Appointment of Arbitrator’ by Mr. M.

This demand was reiterated\n        by a letter dated 13-1-2007, which letter itself informed the\n        appellant that appointment of an arbitrator would have to be made\n        within 30 days. At the very latest, therefore, on the facts of this\n        case, time began to run on and from 12-2-2007. The appellant&#x27;s\n        laconic letter dated 23-1-2007, which stated that the matter was\n        under consideration, was within the 30-day period.

In view of the above, the period of limitation would run when\n       a party acquires a right to refer the disputes to arbitration. Clearly,\n       if the arbitration agreement requires the parties to exhaust the\n       dispute resolution process as a pre-condition for invoking\n       arbitration, the right to refer the dispute to arbitration would arise\n       only after the parties have exhausted the said procedure. The\n       counterparty could raise a valid objection to any step taken to\n       refer the disputes to arbitration in avoidance of the agreed pre-\n       reference dispute resolution procedure. If the parties have agreed\n       that they would first endeavour to resolve the disputes amicably in\n       a particular manner, it is necessary for them to first exhaust that\n       procedure before exercising any right to refer the disputes to\n       arbitration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">       59. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"954540\" id=\"span_71\">In <a href=\"/doc/954540/\" id=\"a_172\">Hari Shankar Singhania v.

It is, therefore, crucial to\n       determine when such ‘right to apply’ accrues in a case. As per the\n       Court, the right to apply would accrue when differences between\n       the parties to the arbitration agreement were evident - when the\n       parties reach a ‘breaking point’, that is, when a settlement with or\n       without conciliation is no longer possible. Pertinently, the Court\n       noted that the limitation period would not start so long as the\n       parties were in dialogue even if differences surfaced during such\n       period, as an interpretation to the contrary would inevitably\n       “compel the parties to resort to litigation/arbitration even where\n       there is serious hope of the parties themselves resolving the\n       issues”. Thus, the right to apply can be said to have accrued “only\n       on the date of the last correspondence between the parties and the\n       period of limitation commences from the date of the last\n       communication between the parties.”</span>\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_88\">51.

Cause of action becomes important for the purposes of calculating the\n      limitation period for bringing an action. It is imperative that a party\n      realises when a cause of action arises. If a party simply delays sending a\n      notice seeking reference under the Act 1996 because they are unclear of\n      when the cause of action arose, the claim can become time-barred even\n      before the party realises the same.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_95\">56.   Russell on Arbitration by Anthony Walton (19th Edn.) at pp. 4-5 states that\n      the period of limitation for commencing an arbitration runs from the date\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                                                                 34</span>\n\f       on which the “cause of arbitration” accrued, that is to say, from the date\n       when the claimant first acquired either a right of action or a right to require\n       that an arbitration take place upon the dispute concerned. The period of\n       limitation for the commencement of an arbitration runs from the date on\n       which, had there been no arbitration clause, the cause of action would have\n       accrued:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">        “Just as in the case of actions the claim is not to be brought after\n        the expiration of a specified number of years from the date on\n        which the cause of action accrued, so in the case of arbitrations,\n        the claim is not to be put forward after the expiration of the\n        specified number of years from the date when the claim accrued.”\n\n       Even if the arbitration clause contains a provision that no cause of action\n       shall accrue in respect of any matter agreed to be referred to until an award\n       is made, time still runs from the normal date when the cause of action\n       would have accrued if there had been no arbitration clause.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_96\">57.   In Law of Arbitration by Justice Bachawat at p. 549, commenting on\n      Section 37, it is stated that subject to the Act 1963, every arbitration must\n      be commenced within the prescribed period. Just as in the case of actions\n      the claim is not to be brought after the expiration of a specified number of\n      years from the date when the cause of action accrues, so in the case of\n      arbitrations the claim is not to be put forward after the expiration of a\n      specified number of years from the date when the claim accrues. For the\n      purpose of Section 37(1) “action” and “cause of arbitration” should be\n      construed as arbitration and cause of arbitration. The cause of arbitration\n      arises when the claimant becomes entitled to raise the question, that is,\n      when the claimant acquires the right to require arbitration. An application\n      under <a href=\"/doc/438099/\" id=\"a_176\">Section 11</a> of the Act 1996 is governed by <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_177\">Article 137</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_178\">Schedule\n      to the Act</a> 1963 and must be made within 3 years from the date when the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                                                                   35</span>\n\f    right to apply first accrues. There is no right to apply until there is a clear\n    and unequivocal denial of that right by the respondent. It must, therefore,\n    be clear that the claim for arbitration must be raised as soon as the cause for\n    arbitration arises as in the case of cause of action arisen in a civil action.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_97\">58. Whether any particular facts constitute a cause of action has to be\n    determined with reference to the facts of each case and with reference to,\n    the substance, rather than the form of the action. If an infringement of a\n    right happens at a particular time, the whole cause of action will be said to\n    have arisen then and there. In such a case, it is not open to a party to sit tight\n    and not to file an application for settlement of dispute of his right, which\n    had been infringed, within the time provided by the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_179\">Limitation Act</a>, and,\n    allow his right to be extinguished by lapse of time, and thereafter, to wait\n    for another cause of action and then file an application under <a href=\"/doc/438099/\" id=\"a_180\">Section 11</a> of\n    the Act 1996 for establishment of his right which was not then alive, and,\n    which had been long extinguished because, in such a case, such an\n    application would mean an application for revival of a right, which had long\n    been extinguished under the Act 1963 and is, therefore, dead for all\n    purposes. Such proceedings would not be maintainable and would\n    obviously be met by the plea of limitation under <a href=\"/doc/249731/\" id=\"a_181\">Article 137</a> of the Act\n    1963.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_98\">59.

The mere bald assertion in this regard is not sufficient\n     as observed by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/109178821/\" id=\"a_182\">Geo Miller</a> (supra). The entire history of the\n     negotiation between the parties must be specifically pleaded and placed on\n     record.

[(1957) 1 All ER 669] the Queen’s Bench Division, Lord\n       Goddard, C.J. (as he then was) held that the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_189\">Limitation Act</a> applies\n       to arbitrations as it applies to actions in the High Court and the\n       making, after a claim has become statute-barred, of a submission\n       of it to arbitration, does not prevent the statute of limitation being\n       pleaded. Russel on Arbitration, 19th Edn., reiterates the above\n       proposition. At page 4 it was further stated that the parties to an\n       arbitration agreement may provide therein, if they wish, that an\n       arbitration must be commenced within a shorter period than that\n       allowed by statute; but the court then has power to enlarge the\n       time so agreed. The period of limitation for commencing an\n       arbitration runs from the date on which the cause of arbitration\n       accrued, that is to say, from the date when the claimant first\n       acquired either a right of action or a right to require that an\n       arbitration takes place upon the dispute concerned.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">       11. Therefore, the period of limitation for the commencement of an\n       arbitration runs from the date on which, had there been no\n       arbitration clause, the cause of action would have accrued. Just\n       as in the case of actions the claim is not to be brought after the\n       expiration of a specified number of years from the date on which\n       the cause of action accrued, so in the case of arbitrations, the\n       claim is not to be put forward after the expiration of the specified\n       number of years from the date when the claim accrued.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">       12. In Russell on Arbitration, at pages 72 and 73 it is stated thus:\n</blockquote>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_86\">                                                                                40</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">\f   “Disputes under a contract may also be removed, in effect,\n   from the jurisdiction of the court, by including an arbitration\n   clause in the contract, providing that any arbitration under it\n   must be commenced within a certain time or not at all, and\n   going on to provide that if an arbitration is not so commenced\n   the claim concerned shall be barred. Such provisions are not\n   necessarily found together. Thus the contract may limit the time\n   for arbitration without barring the claim depriving a party who\n   is out of time of his right to claim arbitration but leaving open\n   a right of action in the courts. Or it may make compliance with\n   a time-limit a condition of any claim without limiting the\n   operation of the arbitration clause, leaving a party who is out\n   of time with the right to claim arbitration but so that it is a\n   defence in the arbitration that the claim is out of time and\n   barred. Nor, since the provisions concerned are essentially\n   separate, is there anything to prevent the party relying on the\n   limitation clause waiving his objection to arbitration whilst\n   still relying on the clause as barring the claim.”\n\nAt page 80 it is stated thus:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">   “An extension of time is not automatic and it is only granted if\n‘undue hardship’ would otherwise be caused. Not all hardship,\nhowever, is ‘undue hardship’; it may be proper that hardship\ncaused to a party by his own default should be borne by him, and\nnot transferred to the other party by allowing a claim to be\nreopened after it has become barred. The mere fact that a claim\nwas barred could not be held to be ‘undue hardship’.”\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">13. The Law of Arbitration by Justice Bachawat in Chapter 37 at\np. 549 it is stated that just as in the case of actions the claim is not\nto be brought after the expiration of a specified number of years\nfrom the date when the claim accrues, so also in the case of\narbitrations, the claim is not to be put forward after the expiration\nof a specified number of years from the date when the claim\naccrues. For the purpose of Section 37(1) ‘action’ and ‘cause of\naction’ in the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_190\">Limitation Act</a> should be construed as arbitration\nand cause of arbitration. The cause of arbitration, therefore,\narises when the claimant becomes entitled to raise the question,\ni.e. when the claimant acquires the right to require arbitration.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_106\">The limitation would run from the date when cause of arbitration\nwould have accrued, but for the agreement.\n</p>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                                                           41</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_107\">\f14. Arbitration implies to charter out timeous commencement of\narbitration availing the arbitral agreement, as soon as difference\nor dispute has arisen. Delay defeats justice and equity aid the\npromptitude and resultant consequences. Defaulting party should\nbear the hardship and should not transmit the hardship to the\nother party, after the claim in the cause of arbitration was allowed\nto be barred. The question, therefore, as posed earlier is whether\nthe court would be justified to permit a contracting party to\nrescind the contract or the court can revoke the authority to refer\nthe disputes or differences to arbitration. Justice Bachawat in\nhis Law of Arbitration, at p. 552 stated that “in an appropriate\ncase leave should be given to revoke the authority of the\narbitrator”. It was also stated that an ordinary submission without\nspecial stipulation limiting or conditioning the functions of the\narbitrator carried with it the implication that the arbitrator should\ngive effect to all legal defences such as that of limitation.\nAccordingly the arbitrator was entitled and bound to apply the law\nof limitation. <a href=\"/doc/880040/\" id=\"a_191\">Section 3</a> of the Limitation Act applied by way of\nanalogy to arbitration proceedings, and like interpretation was\ngiven to <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_192\">Section 14</a> of the Limitation Act. The proceedings before\nthe arbitration are like civil proceedings before the court within\nthe meaning of <a href=\"/doc/409538/\" id=\"a_193\">Section 14</a> of the Limitation Act. By consent the\nparties have substituted the arbitrator for a court of law to arbiter\ntheir disputes or differences. It is, therefore, open to the parties to\nplead in the proceedings before him of limitation as a defence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_108\">15.
