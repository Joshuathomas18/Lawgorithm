Under cl. 3 of the agreement\tthe  sellers\nwere entitled to receive the price only on their  delivering\nto the buyers the full set of shipping documents.  Clause  8\nconferred  on the sellers certain rights against the  buyers\nsuch as the right to resell if the latter refused to  accept\nthe documents.\tClause 14 provided that all disputes arising\nout of or concerning the contract should be referred to\t the\narbitration  of\t the  Bengal Chamber of\t Commerce.   As\t the\nrespondents  failed  to\t deliver the  goods  as\t agreed\t the\nappellants  applied to\tthe Bengal Chamber of  Commerce\t for\narbitration.\tThe   respondents   appeared   before\t the\narbitrators  and contested the claim, but an award was\tmade\nin. favour of the appellant. Thereupon the respondents filed\nan application in the High Court of Calcutta under<a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_1\"> s. 33</a>  of\nthe Arbitration Act, 1940,\n184\nchallenging the validity of the award on the ground that the\ncontract  dated September 7, 1955, was illegal as it was  in\ncontravention of the notification of the Central  Government\ndated  October 29, 1953, issued under<a href=\"/doc/1687832/\" id=\"a_2\"> s. 17</a> of\tthe  Forward\nContracts  (Regulation)\t Act, 1952, which declared  that  no\nperson\tshall enter into any forward contract other  than  a\nnontransferrable specific delivery contract for the sale  or\npurchase  of raw jute in any form...........  The  appellant\npleaded (1) that on the terms of the arbitration clause\t the\nquestion  whether the contract dated September 7, 1955,\t was\nillegal was one for the arbitrator to decide and that it was\nnot   open  to\tthe  respondents    to\traise  the   same in\nproceedings  under<a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_3\"> s. 33</a> of the Arbitration Act ; (2 )\tthat\nthe respondents were estopped from questioning the  validity\nof  the\t award by reason of their having  submitted  to\t the\njurisdiction of the arbitrators ; and (3) that, in any case,\nthe  contract  was  a  nontransferrable\t specific   delivery\ncontract  within  s.  2\t (f  )\tof  the\t <a href=\"/doc/148970782/\" id=\"a_4\">Forward   Contracts\n(Regulation)  Act</a> and was not hit by the notification  dated\nOctober 29, 1933.\nHeld,  that  :\t(1) the dispute as to the  validity  of\t the\ncontract  dated\t September 7, 1955, was not  one  which\t the\narbitrators  were competent to decide under cl. 14 and\tthat\nin consequence the respondents were entitled to maintain the\napplication under<a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_5\"> s. 33</a> of the Arbitration Act.\nWhen an agreement is invalid every part of it including\t the\nclause\tas  to arbitration contained therein  must  also  be\ninvalid.\nLeyman v.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nVENKATARAMA AIYAR, J.-These are appeals against the judgment\nof the High Court of Calcutta, setting aside an award of the\narbitrators,  which  directed the respondent to pay  to\t the\nappellants   Rs.  41,250  as  compensation  for\t breach\t  of\ncontract,  on the ground that the said contract was in\tcon-\ntravention of a notification of the Central Government dated\nOctober\t 29, 1953, and was in consequence illegal and  void.\nThe  facts  are\t that  the appellants own  a  Jute  Mill  at\nCalcutta  and carry on the business of manufacture and\tsale\nof Jute.  On September 7, 1955 they entered into a  contract\nwith the respondents who are doing business as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">186</span>\ndealers\t in  jute,  for the purchase of 750  bales  of\tJute\ncutting &#x27;raw) of Pakistan at Rs. 80 per bale of 400 lbs.  to\nbe  delivered in October, November and December at the\trate\nof  250\t belles\t every month.  Clause 14  of  the  agreement\nprovides that all disputes arising out of or concerning\t the\ncontract should be referred to the arbitration of the Bengal\nChamber of Commerce.  The respondents failed to deliver\t the\ngoods  as  agreed whereupon the appellants  applied  to\t the\nBengal\tChamber\t of Commerce for arbitration  in  accordance\nwith  el.  14 of the agreement. The  respondents  appeared\nbefore\tthe  arbitrators,  and contested the  claim  on\t the\nmerits.\t  The  arbitrators made an award in  favour  of\t the\nappellants for Rs. 41,250 with interest, and that was  filed\nunder  s.  14(2) of the Indian Arbitration Act in  the\tHigh\nCourt of Calcutta in its original side and notice was issued\nto  the\t respondents.  Thereupon the  respondents  filed  an\napplication in the High Court, presumably under<a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_6\"> s. 33</a> of the\narbitration Act, wherein they prayed for a declaration\tthat\nthe contract dated September 7, 1955, was illegal, as it was\nin   contravention  of\tthe  notification  of  the   Central\nGovernment  dated October 29, 1953, and that in\t consequence\nproceedings taken thereunder before the Chamber of  Commerce\nand  the  award in which they resulted were all\t void.\t The\nlearned\t  Judge\t on  the  original  side  before  whom\t the\napplication  came up for hearing dismissed it, and passed  a\n&#x27;decree\t in terms of the award.\t Against both this  judgment\nand  order, the respondents preferred appeals to a  Division\nBench  of the High Court, Appeals Nos. 154 and 173 of  1957.\nThey were heard by Chakravartti, C. J., and Lahari, J.,\t who\nhold that the contract dated September 7, 1955, was  illegal\nas  it\tfell  within the  prohibition  of  the\tnotification\naforesaid  and accordingly allowed the appeal and set  aside\nthe award.  The appellants\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">187</span>\nthen  applied  for a certificate under <a href=\"/doc/1011888/\" id=\"a_7\">Art. 133 (1)</a>  of\t the\nConstitution  and  the same was granted.

Pearey Lal ,Kumar</a> (1) But\t the\nquestion  is  not whether el. 14 is  all  comprehensive\t but\nwhether it could be enforced when the agreement of which  it\nforms  an  integral part is held to be\tillegal.   Logically\nspeaking, it is difficult to conceive how when an  agreement\nfound  to  be bad, any portion of it can held  to  be  good.\nWhen  the whole perishes, its parts also must  perish.\t &#x27;Ex\nnihilo\tnil  fit&#x27;.  On principle therefore it must  be\theld\nthat when an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">189</span>\nagreement is invalid every part of it including the  clause\nas to arbitration contained therein must also be invalid.</span>\nThat  indeed  is what has been <a href=\"/doc/907667/\" id=\"a_14\">laid down  in</a>  the  decisions\nwhich  have been cited before us.  The leading case  on\t the\nsubject\t is the decision of the House of Lords in Heyman  v.\nDacwins Ltd(1).\t There the question was whether\t repudiation\nof  a  contract\t by  a\tparty  thereto\thad  the  effect  of\nannulling&#x27; the arbitration clause contained therein.  It was\nheld  that it had not.\tIt was in this context that the\t law\nas to the circumstances under which an arbitration clause in\nan   agreement\twould  become  unenforceable  came  in\t for\nelaborate  discussion.\t Summing up the law on\tthe  subject\nViscount  Simon, L. C. observed: &quot;If the dispute is  whether\nthe contract which contains the clause has ever been entered\ninto  at all, that issue cannot go to arbitration under\t the\nclause,\t for the party who denies that he has  ever  entered\ninto the contract is thereby denying that he has ever joined\nin  the submission.  Similarly, if one party to the  alleged\ncontract  is contending that it is void ab initio  (because,\nfor ,example, the making of such a contract is illegal), the\narbitration  clause  cannot operate, for on  this  view\t the\nclause\titself also is void.  But, in a situation where\t the\nparties\t are  at one in asserting that they entered  into  a\nbinding\t contract, but a difference has arisen between\tthem\nwhether\t there has been breach by one side or the other,  or\nwhether circumstances have arisen which have discharged\t one\nor  both parties from further performance, such\t differences\nshould\t%be  regarded as differences which have\t arisen\t &quot;in\nrespect\t of&quot; or &quot;with regard to&quot; or, &quot;under&quot;  the  contract,\nand  an\t arbitration clause which. uses these.\tor  similar,\nexpressions ,should be construed accordingly.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">(1)  (1942) A.C. 356.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">190</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">Lord Macmillan with whom Lord Russel agreed observed: &quot;If it\nappears\t that the dispute is whether there has ever  been  a\nbinding contract between the parties, such a dispute  cannot\nbe  covered by an arbitration clause in the challenged\tcon-\ntract.\tIf there has never been a contract at all, there has\nnever  been  as part of it an agreement to  arbitrate.\t The\ngreater includes the less.  Further, a claim to set aside  a\ncontract on such grounds as fraud, duress or essential error\ncannot\tbe  the\t subject  matter of  a\treference  under  an\narbitration clause in the contract sought to be set aside.&quot;\nin  the\t speech\t of  Lord Wright  there\t are  the  following\nobservations  on which the appellants rely: &quot;Hence,  if\t the\nquestion  is  whether  the alleged  contract  was  void\t for\nillegality or being voidable was avoided because induced  by\nfraud or misrepresentation, or on the ground of mistake,  it\ndepends\t on the terms of the submission whether the  dispute\nfalls within the arbitrator&#x27;s jurisdiction.&quot; The argument is\nthat if the arbitration clause is general and unqualified it\nwill  include  a question as to the legality of\t a  contract\nalso.\tThe above observation does lend support to the\tview\nthat  if it was a term of the contract that a dispute as  to\nits  legality could be referred to arbitration, then  it  is\nvalid.\t If that is what was meant by Lord Wright  it  maybe\ndifficult  to  reconcile it with the view expressed  in\t the\npassages  already  cited.  But it is to be  noted  that\t the\nnoble Lord wound up with the following observation &quot;Finally,\nI   agree  with\t the  general  conclusions  on\tthe   matter\nsummarised by the Lord Chancellor in the closing  paragraphs\nof his opinion&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">The  appellants also rely on the following  observations  in\nthe speech of Lord Porter: &quot;If two parties purports to enter\ninto a contract and a dispute arises whether they have\tdone\nso or not,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">191</span>\nor  whether the alleged contract is binding on them.  I\t see\nno  reason  why\t .-hey should not  submit  that\t dispute  to\narbitration.   Equally I see no reason why, if at  the\ttime\nwhen  they  purport, to make the contract they\tforesee\t the\npossibility  of\t such  a dispute arising,  they\t should\t not\nprovide\t in  the  contract  itself  for\t the  submission  to\narbitration  of\t a dispute whether the contract\t ever  bound\nthem  or continues to do so............ It may require\tvery\nclear language to effect this result, and it may be true  to\nsay  that  such\t a  contract is\t really\t collateral  to\t the\nagreement  supposed to have been made, but I do not see\t why\nit should not be done&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">But these dicta must be read with the following observations\nin the same speech: &quot;Where the contract itself is repudiated\nin  the\t sense that the original existence  or\tits  binding\nforce  is  challenged,\te. g., where it\t is  said  that\t the\nparties\t never\twere ad idem, or where it is said  that\t the\ncontract  is voidable ab initio (e. g., in cases  of  fraud,\nmisrepresentation or mistake) and that it has been  avoided,\nthe  parties  are not bound by any contract and\t escape\t the\nobligation  to\tperform\t any  of  its  terms  including\t the\narbitration clause unless the provisions of that clause\t are\nwide enough to include the question of jurisdiction&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">According to Lord Porter, then; there can be an agreement to\nrefer  a  dispute  as  to the  validity\t of  a\tcontract  to\narbitration,  that  where such an agreement is part  of\t the\ncontract  which is impugned as invalid, then it can have  no\nexistence apart from it and there can be no reference  based\nthereon,  but  where  such  an\tagreement  is  distinct\t and\nseparate  from the impugned contract. a\t reference  pursuant\nthereto\t will  be valid and if is possible that\t both  these\nagreements might be contained in one document.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">192</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">The  law  is thus summarised in Halsburys Laws\tof  England,\nThird  Edition,\t Vol.  2, p. 24,. par&amp;\t56:  The  matter  in\nquestion in the legal proceedings which it is sought to stay\nmust\tbe   within   the   scope   of\t  the\t arbitration\nagreement............. If, however, the point in dispute  is\nwhether the contract containing the clause was ever  entered\ninto  at  all, or was void ab initio, illegal,\tor  obtained\n(for example) by fraud duress or undue influence, the clause\ndoes not apply and a stay will be refused.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1391279\" id=\"span_9\">This question arose incidentally for discussion in the <a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_15\">Union\nof  India  v.

We\t are\naccordingly  of\t the  opinion  that  the  dispute  that\t the\ncontract&#x27;  dated September 7, 1955, is illegal and  void  is\nnot one which the arbitrators are competent to decide  under\ncl.  14 and that inconsequence the respondents are  entitled\nto  maintain  the  present application under<a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_20\"> s.\t 33</a>  of\t the\nArbitration Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_14\">(2)It  is next contended for the appellants ,that even\tif\ncl.  14\t should be held to be inoperative by reason  of\t the\nfact that the dispute is one relating to the validity of the\ncontract, the respondents  are estopped from now challenging\nthe  award on that ground, because they appeared before\t the\narbitrators  and took part in the proceedings  before  them.\nThe  decision in Ex p. Wyld (1) is relied on in\t support  of\nthis contention.  In that case a dispute between an assignee\nin  bankruptcy\tand a creditor, Mr. Wyld,  was\treferred  to\narbitration on the, basis of an agreement in writing between\nthem.  An award having been pronounced against Mr. Wyld,  he\ndisputed  its validity on the ground that the  assignee\t had\nnot  obtained the leave of the Court for entering  into\t the\narbitration.\tIn  rejecting  this  contention\t the   Court\nobserved that under the law the agreement was binding on Mr.\nWyld   even  though the leave of the Court was not  obtained\nand  that  therefore  he  was  not  entitled  to  take\tthis\nobjection  based on the informality of the submission as  he\nhad  himself  acted on it.  This decision is clearly  of  no\nassistance  to the appellants because there was a valid\t and\nsubsisting  submission\ton  which the  jurisdiction  of\t the\narbitrators  to bear the dispute was complete, and that\t was\nnot  affected by the failure of the assignee to\t obtain\t the\nrequisite\n(1)  (1861) 30 Law J.

If there had been  another\narbitration  agreement apart from and independent of cl.  14\nof the contract dated September 7, 1955, it might have\tbeen\npossible  to sustain the proceedings before the\t arbitrators\nas referable to that agreement.\t But none such has been\t set\nup  or proved in the present case.

There  is  no\ndispute\t between the parties that it is a specific  delivery\ncontract.  It is between named buyers and sellers the  goods\nare specified, as also the period during which they have  to\nbe actually delivered and their price is fixed.\t What is  in\ncontroversy   is   whether  it\tis  transferable   or\tnon-\ntransferable.  There was considerable argument before us  on\nthe question as to assignability of a contract.\t The law  of\nthe  subject is well settled and might be stated  in  simple\nterms.\tAn assignment of a contract might result by transfer\neither of the rights or of the obligations thereunder.\t But\nthere  is  a well-recognised distinction between  these\t two\nclasses\t of  assignments.   As a rule  obligations  under  a\ncontract  cannot be assigned except with the consent of\t the\npromisee,  and\twhen such consent is given, it is  really  a\nnovation  resulting in substitution of liabilities.  On\t the\nother hand rights under a contract are assignable unless the\ncontract is personal in its nature the rights are  incapable\nof  assignment\teither under the law or under  an  agreement\nbetween the parties.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\"> 199</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"29862148\" id=\"span_19\">In  the light of the principles stated above, we  shall\t now\nconsider  whether the contract dated September, 7, 1955,  is\nor  is\tnot transferable.  As it is only a benefit  under  a\ncontract that can be assigned, the discussion really centres\nround two questions, are the buyers entitled to assign their\nright  to  got the goods on payment of price ? And  are\t the\nsellers entitled to assign their right to receive the  price\non delivery of the goods ? On the question as to the  rights\nof the buyers to assign their right to the goods, the matter\nis clear beyond all doubts, The licence which authorises the\nappellants  to\timport\tthe goods from\tEast  Pakistan\talso\nprohibits  them expressly from assigning the same.  In\tthis\nconnection it should be noted that, owing to the  exigencies\nof  Foreign  Exchange,\tthere have been\t in  force,  at\t all\nmaterial times, restrictions on import of goods.  The nature\nof  these  restrictions\t and the  policy  behind  them\twere\nexamined  by  this  Court quite recently in  <a href=\"/doc/29862148/\" id=\"a_37\">Daya  v.  Joint\nController</a> of  imports and Exports (1) and it is unnecessary\nto repeat them.\t It is sufficient for the present purpose to\nstate  that the issue of import licences by  the  Government\nwas  restricted\t to  persons who had  been  engaged  in\t the\nbusiness of import during a specified period and there\twere\nalso limitations on the extent to which they could import.\nManufacture  of jute occupies the pride of place  among\t the\nindustries  of\tWest  Bengal.  Raw  jute  required  for\t the\nbusiness  is  largely imported from East Pakistan,  and\t for\nthat purpose import licences were being granted from time to\ntime,  to  manufactures of jute.  During the period  of\t the\ncontract with which we are concerned the appellants held two\nimport\tlicences  from\tthe Government of India\t (1)  No.  A\n062290/52 and (2) A 063733/52.\tThe licence No. A 062291)/52\nwhich is in the standard.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">(1) (1963) 2 S.C.R. 73.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">200</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">form  is.  so  far as it is material for  the  present\tdis-\ncussion, as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">&quot;Import Trade Control.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">Office of the Joint Chief Controller of Imports, Calcutta.\nLicence\t No. A 062290152/A.U./C.C.I/C.

In view of the terms of the licence  there\ncan  be\t no question of assignment of the  contract  by\t the\nbuyers.\t That is not disputed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">Turning next to the sellers, can they assign their right  to\nthe price on delivery of the goods ?  The learned Judges  in\nthe  Court  below held that they could,\t because  there\t was\nnoting\tpersonal in the contract, and nothing in  its  terms\nwhich barred the right to assign a benefit which a party had\nunder\tthe   general  law.   The  appellants\tassail\t the\ncorrectness of this decision.  They contend the terms of the\ncontract  must be construed in the light of the\t surrounding\ncircumstances,\tand  especially of the import  licence,\t and\nthat  if that is done, the pro.per conclusion to come to  is\nthat  the  agreement is not transferable.   This  contention\nmust now be examined.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">The  appellants sought, in the first instance, to  establish\non  the\t basis of clauses 12 and 14 that  the  agreement  is\npersonal in its character, and is therefore not\t assignable.\nNow  the contract in question is one for the sale of  goods,\nand ordinary there can be nothing personal about it.  It  is\nof no consequence to the buyer as to who delivers the goods.\nWhat matters to him is that the goods delivered should be in\naccordance  with the specifications.  But it is argued\tthat\nthe status of the parties was a determinative factor in\t the\nmaking\tof the agreement, and that is sought to\t be  deduced\nfrom  el. 12 of the contract.  That clause provides that  if\neither\tor both the parties to the contract are\t members  of\nthe  Indian Jute Mills Association and if either of them  is\nplaced\tin  the\t disapproved list of  Association  then\t the\ncontract shall be deemed to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">202</span>\nhave  been  broken by that party.  That shows, it  is  said,\nthat  the  contract  was entered into on the  faith  of\t the\nstatus\tof  the\t parties  as  members  of  the\tJute   Mills\nAssociation.  But it is clear from the wording of the clause\nthat  the  parties to the contract need not  necessarily  be\nmembers of the Association and that being so, the element of\nstatus\tdoes  not enter into it.  Clause 14,  Which  is\t the\narbitration clause, is also relied on as an indication\tthat\nthe  contract is personal in its character and incapable  of\nassignment  on that ground.  But it is settled law  that  an\narbitration  clause does not take away the right of a  party\nto  a contract to assign it if it is  otherwise\t assignable.\nVide  Shayler  v. Woolf (1) and Russel on  Arbitation,\t16th\nEdition, p. 65.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">It is also argued that the rights conferred on the  &#x27;sellers\nunder el. 8 are incapable of assignment in law, and that  is\nan  indication that the rights under the agreement  are\t not\ntransferable.\tClause\t8  confers on  the  sellers  certain\nrights\tagainst buyers, such as the rights to resell and  so\nforth, when the latter refuse to accept the documents.\tWhat\nis  said is that these rights cannot be assigned in  law  as\nthey are really claims founded on breach of contract by\t the\nbuyers.\t That undoubtedly is so, but that does not  conclude\nthe  question.\tThere is in law a clear distinction  between\nassignment  of\trights under a contract by a party  who\t has\nperformed  his obligations thereunder, and assignment  of  a\nclaim for compensation which one party has against the other\nfor  breach  of contract.  The letter is a  mere  claim\t for\ndamages\t which\tcannot be assigned in law, the former  is  a\nbenefit under an agreement, which is capable of\t assignment.\nThe fact therefore that the rights under el. 8 are incapable\nof  assignment does not stand in the way of the\t respondents\nassigning  their  rights to receive the ice after  they\t had\nperformed their obligations.

R. 54.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">203</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">That  brings us on to cl. 3 on which the appellants  mainly.\nUnder  that clause the sellers are entitled to\treceive\t the\nprice only on their delivering to the buyers the full set of\nshipping  documents.   Now  the\t argument  is  that  as\t the\ndelivery  of documents and payment of cash are to be  simul-\ntaneous,  it  is a case of benefit under  a  contract  being\nburdened  with\ta  liability, and that\tsuch  a\t benefit  is\nincapable  of assignment under the law.\t The learned  Judges\nin  the Court below took the view that there was nothing  in\nthis clause which prevented the seller from transferring the\ndocuments  to a third party authorising him to deliver\tthem\nto the buyers, and then to receive the price from them,\t and\nthey further observed.\t&quot;Although in presenting the shipping\ndocuments  the\ttransferee from the seller may\tact  as\t his\nagent, he will not be an agent in receiving payment from the\nbuyer,\tbecause\t the right to receive the payment  has\tbeen\ntransferred to him and has become his own right&quot;.\nThe  respondents maintain that that is the correct  view  to\ntake of the rights of the parties under this clause and rely\non the statements of law in Halsbury&#x27;s Laws of England,\t and\nthe  decision British Waggon Co. v. Lea (1).  In  Halsbury&#x27;s\nLaws of England, 3rd Edn., Vol. 8, p. 258, para 451, the law\nis  thus  stated : &quot;There is, however, no objection  to\t the\nsubstituted performance by a third person of the duties of a\nparty to the contract where the duties are disconnected from\nthe  skill, character, or other personal  qualifications  of\nthe party to the contract. ID such a circumstance,  however,\nthe  liability\tof  the original contracting  party  is\t not\ndischarged, and the only effect is that the other party\t may\nbe  able to look to the third party for the  performance  of\nthe  contractual  obligations in addition  to  the  original\ncontracting  party&quot;.   In British Waggon Co. v.\t leg(1)\t the\nfacts\n(1)  (1880) 5 Q.B.D. 149, 154.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">204</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">were  that a company called the Parkgate Waggon Company\t had\nhired  waggons to the defendant on the terms that he  should\npay rent for their use, and that the Company should  execute\nthe necessary, repairs for them.  The company then  assigned\nits rights under the contract to another company called\t the\nBritish\t Company, subject to the obligation to\texecute\t the\nrepairs.  In accordance with his agreement the assignee\t did\nexecute\t  the  repairs.\t  Thereafter  Parkgate\tWaggon\t Co,\ndemanded rent from the defendant, who resisted the claim  on\nthe  ground  that  the\tCompany\t had  disabled\titself\tfrom\nperforming the contract, by reason of assignment to which he\nhad not consented.  In overruling this contention the  Court\nobserved that as the work to be done under the contract\t did\nnot  require  personal\tskill Or  confidence,  the  Parkgate\nWaggon\tCompany\t could get it done by any person,  and\tthat\nwould be sufficient performance.  This decision would be  in\npoint if the respondents had arranged to deliver the jute to\nthe appellants through another person, and then claimed\t the\nprice,\tand  that  claim was disputed.\tBut  it\t is  not  an\nauthority  on the question which we have to decide,  whether\nthe assignment of the benefit under the contract burdened as\nit is with an obligation would itself be valid.\t It is\ttrue\nthat the Court observed in passing &quot;That a debt accruing due\nunder  a contract can, since the passing of  the  Judicature\nActs, be assigned at law as well as equity, cannot since the\ndecision  in  Brice v. Bannister(1) be\tdisputed&quot;.   But  it\nshould\t be  noted  that  both\tthe  companies\tfigured\t  is\nplaintiffs,  and therefore it is not possible to read  chose\nobservation  as a decision that an assignment of  a  benefit\nburdened with an obligation is valid.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_38\">It  was argued for the respondents that it would  have\tbeen\nopen to them to first obtain the requisite certificate\tfrom\nthe Dank in East Pakistan\n(1)  (1878) 3 Q.B.D. 560.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">205</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">then  deliver  it to the appellants, and then  assign  their\nright to the price.  But the question is not what could have\nbeen  done by a seller in a forward contract generally,\t but\nwhat  was  in  fact  contemplated by  the  parties  to\tthis\ncontract  under\t el.  3, The provisions\t that  the  shipping\ndocuments  in Pakistan should be taken in the name  of&#x27;\t the\nbuyer that the sellers should deliver them to the buyers and\nreceive the price, and that the goods should be delivered at\nthe Mills of the buyers, strongly suggest that the intention\nof  the parties was, that neither of them should assign\t the\ncontract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">Whatever doubts one might have as to the true import of\t cl,\n3-it   may  be\tconceded,  that\t it  lends  itself  to\t the\nconstruction  put on it by the learned Judges in  the  Court\nbelow,\tthe position becomes unmistakably clear when  it  is\nconstrued  in the light of the import licence in  favour  of\nthe  appellants.  It has been already mentioned that  it  is\nthis which authorises the appellants to import raw jute from\nEast Pakistan.\tIt is statedly not transferable, and further\nthe  goods  imported  thereunder are to\t be  used  only\t for\nconsumption in the Mills of the appellants.  It is contended\nfor  the  respondents  that they are  not  parties  to\tthis\nlicence\t and  that  their rights under the  general  law  to\nassign benefits under the contract remain unaffected by\t it.\nThis is to take too narrow a view of the true position.\t Far\nfrom  being strangers to the licence, the  evidence  clearly\nestablishes  that they are very intimately  associated\twith\nit.   On  September  26, 1955, acting under  licence  No,  A\n062290/52 the appellants wrote to the Joint Chief Controller\nof  Imports  and Exports, Government of India, to  &quot;issue  a\nletter\tof authority in favour of sellers Messrs.  Raymon  &amp;\nCompany\t (India) Ltd., for 2,500 maunds jute cuttings to  be\nimported  from\tNarayanganj, (East  Pakistan),\tagainst\t the\nabove (licence).&quot;\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">206</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">The  letter of authority was received by the  appellants  on\nSeptember  29, 1956, and they sent it on to the\t respondents\nwith the following letter\n&quot;Dear Sirs,\n\t\t     Contract No. 2306\nWe  are\t sending.  here with the Exchange  Control  Copy  of\nLetter of Authority for 1250 Mds.  Jute cuttings against the\nabove.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">Contract No. 2306 referred to in this letter is the contract\ndated September 7, 1955, involved in this dispute.  It is on\nthe   strength\tof  this  letter  of  authority\t  that\t the\nrespondents  opened a letter of credit with a Bank  in\tEast\nPakistan   and\tthe  goods  were  imported.   We  have\t not\noverlooked  the\t fact  that  while  the\t contract  is  dated\nSeptember 7, 1955, the licence is dated September 22,  1955,\nand  the  letter  of authority to the  respondents  is\teven\nlater, and it might strike one as an anachronism to read the\nlicence and the letter of authority into the contract.\t But\nit  should be remembered that the licences are\tin  standard\nform and are renewed from time to time except as to  details\nconcerning the imports, and the course of business  followed\nin  the\t jute market was throughout in conformity  with\t the\nconditions  laid  down. in the licence and was of  the\tsame\npattern.   Now\tthe  agreement provides\t that  the  shipping\ndocuments  in  Pakistan are to be taken in the name  of\t the\nbuyers\tthat the sellers are &quot;to open letter of credit&quot;\t and\nthat  the  goods are to be delivered ,at  the  buyer&#x27;s\tMill\nsiding&quot;.   We  have  no doubt that  these  terms  have\tbeen\ninserted  with a view to give effect to the  conditions\t on\nwhich licences are granted and that it was the understanding\nof  both  the sellers and buyers that the rights  under\t the\ncontract were not to be transferred.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">207</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1150492\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"442455\" id=\"span_29\">But it is argued for the respondents that unless there is in\nthe contract itself a specific clause prohibiting  transfer,\nthe  plea  that it is not transferable is not  open  to\t the\nappellants  and that evidence aliunde is not  admissible  to\nestablish   it\tand  the  decision  in\t<a href=\"/doc/442455/\" id=\"a_38\">Seetharamaswami\t  v.\nBhagwathi Oil Company</a>(1), Hanumanthiah v.

(3)\t are\nrelied on in support of this position.\tWe agree that when a\ncontract  has been reduced to writing we must look  only  to\nthat  writing  for ascertaining the terms of  the  agreement\nbetween the parties but it does not follow from this that it\nis  only what is set out expressly and in so many  words  in\nthe  document  that can constitute a term  of  the  contract\nbetween\t the parties.  If on a reading of the document as  a\nwhole, it can fairly be deduced from the words actually used\ntherein\t that the parties had agreed on a  particular  term,\nthere is nothing in law which prevents them from setting  up\nthat  term.   The terms of a contract can  be  expressed  or\nimplied from what has been expressed.  It is in the ultimate\nanalysis  a question of construction of the  contract.\t And\nagain  it is well established that in construing a  contract\nit  would  be legitimate to take  into\taccount\t surrounding\ncircumstances.\tTherefore on the question whether there\t was\nan agreement between the parties that the contract was to be\nnon-transferable,   the\t  absence  of  a   specific   clause\nforbidding transfer is not conclusive.\tWhat has to be\tseen\nis  whether it could be held on a reasonable  interpretation\nof  the\t contract,  aided  by  such  considerations  as\t can\nlegitimately be taken into account that the agreement of the\nparties was that it was not to be transferred.\tWhen once  a\nconclusion is reached that such was the understanding of the\nparties, there is nothing in law which prevents effect\tfrom\nbeing given to it.  That was the view\n(1) [1951] 1 M.L.J. 147.

Ramakrishna\tRice  &amp;\t oil\nMills(1), and that in our opinion is correct.\nIt  remains  to deal with one other question  on  which\t the\nparties have been at issue.  It turns on a consideration  of<a href=\"/doc/738672/\" id=\"a_40\">\ns.  2(f)</a> of the Act.  A non-transferable  specific  delivery\ncontract  is  defined  in  s. 2(f),  omitting  what  is\t not\nmaterial,  as  a specific delivery contract  the  rights  or\nliabilities  under  which  are not  transferable.   Now\t the\ncontention  of\tthe  appellants is that\t as  admittedly\t the\nliabilities under the contract are not transferable it is  a\nnon-transferable  contract  within<a href=\"/doc/738672/\" id=\"a_41\"> s. 2(f)</a>.   But  the\tres-\npondents argue that on that construction no forward contract\nwill  be hit by the notification because  liabilities  under\nthe   contract\t can  never  be\t transferred  and   so\t the\nnotification would become futile.  They accordingly  contend\nthat  word  or&#x27;\t should\t be read as an&amp;\t and  that  on\tthat\nconstruction  unless both the rights and  liabilities  under\nthe   contract\tare  non-transferable  it  is  not  a\tnon-\ntransferable contract as defined in a. 2(f).  The appellants\nurge  that  on this construction no contract would  be\tnon-\ntransferable  as  rights  under a  contract  can  always  be\ntransferred  unless it is personal in its character and\t the\nsection would become practically useless.  The intention  of\nthe  legislature as expressed in the section is, it must  be\nadmitted, clouded in obscurity and uncertainty.\t But in\t the\nview  we  have\ttaken, that the contract  is  on  its  terms\nproperly construed, non-transferable, it becomes unnecessary\nto  decide  between the arrival contentions as to  the\ttrue\nimport of<a href=\"/doc/738672/\" id=\"a_42\"> s. 2(f)</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">In  the\t result the appeals are allowed with costs  one\t set\nthroughout and one hearing fee.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">\t       Appeals allowed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">(1)  A.I.R. 1956 Mod. 110.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">209</span>\n\n\n\n","numcites":20,"numcitedby":144,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":1986314,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"assignment of contract ","formInput":"assignment%20of%20contract%20"},{"value":"all india reporter","formInput":"all%20india%20reporter"},{"value":"arbitration clause contract","formInput":"arbitration%20clause%20contract"},{"value":"letter of authority","formInput":"letter%20of%20authority"},{"value":"'non transferable specific delivery contract'","formInput":"%27non%20transferable%20specific%20delivery%20contract%27"},{"value":"\"non-transferable specific delivery contract\"","formInput":"%22non-transferable%20specific%20delivery%20contract%22"},{"value":"forward contract regulation act","formInput":"forward%20contract%20regulation%20act"},{"value":"void and void ab initio","formInput":"void%20and%20void%20ab%20initio"},{"value":"dispute from a contract","formInput":"dispute%20from%20a%20contract"},{"value":"assignment of rights","formInput":"assignment%20of%20rights"},{"value":"forward contracts","formInput":"forward%20contracts"},{"value":"arbitration clause","formInput":"arbitration%20clause"},{"value":"contract dispute","formInput":"contract%20dispute"},{"value":"rights of buyers","formInput":"rights%20of%20buyers"},{"value":"contract act","formInput":"contract%20act"},{"value":"contract of sale","formInput":"contract%20of%20sale"},{"value":"\"void ab initio\"","formInput":"%22void%20ab%20initio%22"},{"value":"contract arbitration","formInput":"contract%20arbitration"},{"value":" void ab initio","formInput":"%20void%20ab%20initio"},{"value":"Ab initio","formInput":"Ab%20initio"}],"cats":[{"value":"arbitration-agreement","formInput":"tag:arbitration-agreement"},{"value":"arbitration","formInput":"tag:arbitration"},{"value":"power-to-remit-award","formInput":"tag:power-to-remit-award"},{"value":"judgment-according-to-the-award","formInput":"tag:judgment-according-to-the-award"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
