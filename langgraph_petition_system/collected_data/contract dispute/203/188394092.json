The\n\n\n\n\n\n    judgments relied upon by the learned senior counsel for the\n    respondent interpreting <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_81\">section 16</a> of the Arbitration &amp; Conciliation\n    Act, 1996 are not relevant to decide whether arbitration agreement\n    can be assigned or not. Under <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_82\">section 16</a> of the Arbitration &amp;\n\n\n\n\n\n    Conciliation Act, 1996, it is provided that an arbitration clause which\n    forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement\n    independent of the other terms of the contract. It is provided that the\n    arbitral tribunal has power to rule on its own jurisdiction including\n    ruling on any objections with respect to the existence or validity of the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                         35/37</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">          ::: Uploaded on - 20/07/2016                 ::: Downloaded on - 20/07/2016 23:59:11 :::</span>\n                                                                    arbp509-11\n\n    arbitration agreement and for that purpose, the arbitration clause\n    which forms part of a contract shall be treated as an agreement\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                \n    independent of the other terms of the contract. Merely because a\n\n\n\n\n                                                        \n    party has appointed an arbitrator or has participated in the\n    appointment of an arbitrator, he is not precluded from raising a plea\n    of jurisdiction in the arbitral proceedings. The scheme of <a href=\"/doc/675839/\" id=\"a_83\">section 16</a>\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    permitting a party to raise such an objection of jurisdiction though he\n    had participated in the appointment of an arbitrator in an arbitration,\n    without intervention of the Court is totally different and is limited only\n\n\n\n\n                                                \n    for that purpose. In my view, the judgments interpreting <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_84\">section 16</a> of\n    the Arbitration Act would not apply in case of an assignment of a\n                                   \n    contract including arbitration agreement.\n</p>                                  \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_95\">    77.          A perusal of the record indicates that the arbitral tribunal\n    has not accepted the case of the respondent that in view of clause 6\n    of the Memorandum of Sale entered into between the petitioner and\n        \n\n    DLF Universal Limited, the petitioner could act only as a constituted\n    authority on behalf of the said assignors in case of any dispute\n     \n\n\n\n    between the petitioner and the respondent. It is not in dispute that the\n    said assignors did not file any separate proceedings against the\n\n\n\n\n\n    respondent nor the respondent filed any separate proceedings\n    against the said assignors in respect of the dispute arising under the\n    said two contracts dated 16th April, 1997.\n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_96\">    78.          In my view, no separate execution of the arbitration\n    agreement was required to be executed between the petitioner and\n    the respondent, in view of the fact that the         said two contracts\n    containing arbitration agreement was already assigned in favour of\n    the petitioner and the entire contracts were acted upon by both the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">                                         36/37</span>\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">          ::: Uploaded on - 20/07/2016                  ::: Downloaded on - 20/07/2016 23:59:11 :::</span>\n                                                                        arbp509-11\n\n    parties herein.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                                                    \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_97\">    79.
