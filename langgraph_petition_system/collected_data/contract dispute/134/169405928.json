No. 4345 of 2014 in  O.P.  (ARB)\n      No.  802/2014  directing  the  first  respondent  therein  to  furnish\n      security for US$ 11,15,400  or  its  equivalent  (approximate)  Indian\n      Rupees 6,60,00,000/- or to show cause on or before 01.10.2014, and  as\n      an interim measure conditionally attaching the cargo belonging to  the\n      first respondent herein, while dealing with an application moved under\n      <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 9</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (for  brevity,\n      &quot;the Act&quot;), on the foundation that <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 9</a> of the Act is limited  to\n      the applications to arbitration that takes place in India and  has  no\n      applicability to arbitration which takes place outside India  in  view\n      of the pronouncement in  <a href=\"/doc/173015163/\" id=\"a_3\">Bharat  Aluminium  Co.  v.  Kaiser  Aluminium\n      Technical Services Inc.</a>[1] inasmuch as clause 5 of the contract  which\n      is the arbitration clause clearly spells out that the contract  is  to\n      be governed and construed according to English law and if the  dispute\n      of the claim does not exceed USD 50,000,  the  arbitration  should  be\n      conducted in accordance with small  claims  procedure  of  the  London\n      Maritime Arbitration Association.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">      2.    Regard being had to the lis in question,  suffice  it  to  state\n      that an agreement was entered into between the parties  on  20.10.2010\n      in respect of 24 voyages of coal shipment belonging to the  appellant,\n      the first respondent before the High Court, from Indonesia  to  India.\n      The respondent no. 1 herein, Gupta Coal India Ltd., undertook only  15\n      voyages and that resulted in disputes which ultimately stood  referred\n      to arbitration.  Be it noted, an addendum to contract was executed  as\n      regards the remaining voyages  on  3.4.2013  when  disputes  arose  in\n      respect of the principal/main agreement.  As the facts  would  undrape\n      arbitration proceedings were initiated and  eventually  an  award  was\n      passed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">      3.    After the award came into existence, the present appellant filed\n      an application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 9</a> before the  District  Court,  Ernakulam\n      for its enforcement under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_5\">Sections 9</a>/<a href=\"/doc/784819/\" id=\"a_6\">47</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1559160/\" id=\"a_7\">49</a> of  the  Act.   As  the\n      factual narration would further uncurtain in respect of  the  addendum\n      to contract, when disputes arose relating  to  the  same,  arbitration\n      proceedings were initiated and at that juncture, the  appellant  moved\n      the learned 2nd Additional District Court, Ernakulam under  <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_8\">Section  9</a>\n      of the Act seeking attachment of the cargos as an interim  relief  and\n      the learned Additional District Judge, as  has  been  stated  earlier,\n      issued conditional order of attachment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">      4.    The order passed by the learned Additional District Judge,   was\n      assailed before the High Court in a Writ Petition, O.P.(C) No. 2612 of\n      2014 raising a singular contention that the impugned order therein was\n      absolutely without jurisdiction and hence, unsustainable in law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"173015163\" id=\"span_3\">5.    A counter affidavit was filed contending, inter alia,  that  the\n      application  before  the  learned  Additional   District   Judge   was\n      maintainable inasmuch as the contract between the parties was  entered\n      into prior to the  decision  in  <a href=\"/doc/173015163/\" id=\"a_9\">Bharat  Aluminium  Co.</a>  (supra)  and,\n      therefore, the principle <a href=\"/doc/173015163/\" id=\"a_10\">laid  down  in</a>  <a href=\"/doc/173015163/\" id=\"a_11\">the  said  decision</a>  was  not\n      attracted to the facts of the case, and in fact, it  was  governed  by\n      the principles stated in <a href=\"/doc/110552/\" id=\"a_12\">Bhatia International v.

In\n           the case of a declaration, it is supposed to have been  the  law\n           always and  one  cannot  be  heard  to  say  that  it  has  only\n           prospective effect.  It is deemed to have been the  law  at  all\n           times.

At the very outset, it is necessary to clear the maze as regards\n      the understanding of the ratio in <a href=\"/doc/173015163/\" id=\"a_20\">Bharat Aluminium Co.</a> (supra) by  the\n      High Court.

The judgment in Bhatia International was rendered by  this\n           Court on 13-3-2002. Since then, the aforesaid judgment has  been\n           followed by all the High Courts as well  as  by  this  Court  on\n           numerous occasions. In fact,  the  judgment  in  Venture  Global\n           Engg. has been rendered on 10-1-2008 in terms of  the  ratio  of\n           the decision in Bhatia  International.  Thus,  in  order  to  do\n           complete justice, we hereby order, that the law now declared  by\n           this Court shall apply prospectively,  to  all  the  arbitration\n           agreements executed hereafter.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"173015163\" id=\"span_9\">The aforesaid judgment by the Constitution Bench was decided  on\n      September 6, 2012.  In the instant case, the arbitration agreement was\n      executed prior to that date and the addendum,  as  mentioned  earlier,\n      came into existence afterwards.  Therefore, there can be no  scintilla\n      of doubt that the authority in <a href=\"/doc/173015163/\" id=\"a_21\">Bharat Aluminium Co.</a> case would not  be\n      applicable for determination of the controversy in hand.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_10\">In fact, the\n      pronouncement in <a href=\"/doc/110552/\" id=\"a_22\">Bhatia International</a> (supra) would be  applicable  to\n      the facts of the present case inasmuch as  there  is  nothing  in  the\n      addendum to suggest any arbitration and, in fact, it is controlled and\n      governed by the conditions postulated in the principal  contract.   We\n      shall advert to this aspect slightly  more  specifically  at  a  later\n      stage.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_11\">8.    Keeping the  aforesaid  in  view,  it  is  necessary  to  keenly\n      understand the decision in <a href=\"/doc/110552/\" id=\"a_23\">Bhatia International</a> (supra).  In the  said\n      case, the agreement entered into between  the  parties,  contained  an\n      arbitration clause which provided that arbitration was to  be  as  per\n      Rules of International Chambers of Commerce  (for  short,  &quot;the  ICC).\n      The parties had agreed that the arbitration was to be held  in  Paris,\n      France.  The first respondent filed an application under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 9</a>  of\n      the Act before the learned Additional  District  Judge,  Indore,  M.P.\n      with an interim prayer.  A plea was raised by the appellant  that  the\n      Indore Court had no jurisdiction and application was not maintainable.\n       The said stand was repelled by the learned Additional District Judge,\n      which found favour with the High Court.  Before  this  Court,  it  was\n      urged on behalf of the appellant that <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_25\">Part I of the Act</a>  only  applies\n      to arbitration where the place of arbitration is in India, but if  the\n      place of arbitration is not in India, then <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_26\">Part II of  the  Act</a>  would\n      apply.  On behalf of the respondent therein, it was urged that  unless\n      the parties, by their agreement either expressly or impliedly  exclude\n      its  provisions,  Part  I  would  also  apply  to  all   international\n      commercial arbitrations including those that take place in India.  The\n      three-Judge Bench came to hold thus:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           &quot;To conclude, we hold that the provisions of Part I would  apply\n           to all arbitrations and to  all  proceedings  relating  thereto.\n           Where such arbitration is held in India the provisions of Part I\n           would compulsorily apply and parties are free to deviate only to\n           the extent permitted by the derogable provisions of Part  I.  In\n           cases of international commercial arbitrations held out of India\n           provisions  of  Part  I  would  apply  unless  the  parties   by\n           agreement, express  or  implied,  exclude  all  or  any  of  its\n           provisions. In that case the laws or rules chosen by the parties\n           would prevail. Any provision, in Part I, which is contrary to or\n           excluded   by   that   law   or   rules   will    not    apply.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">           [Emphasis supplied]\n\n\n            After the said conclusion was recorded, the stand of the learned\n      senior counsel for the appellant was put thus:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">           &quot;Faced with this situation Mr Sen submits that, in this case the\n           parties had agreed that the arbitration be as per the  Rules  of\n           ICC. He submits that thus by  necessary  implication  <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_27\">Section  9</a>\n           would not apply. In our view, in such cases the  question  would\n           be  whether  <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_28\">Section  9</a>  gets  excluded  by  the  ICC  Rules  of\n           Arbitration. <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_29\">Article 23</a> of the ICC Rules reads as follows:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">               Conservatory and interim measures\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">                 1.

The  Arbitral\n              Tribunal may make the granting of any such measure subject to\n              appropriate security being furnished by the requesting party.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">              Any such measure shall take the  form  of  an  order,  giving\n              reasons, or of an award, as the Arbitral  Tribunal  considers\n              appropriate.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">                 2. Before the file is transmitted to the Arbitral Tribunal,\n              and in appropriate circumstances even thereafter, the parties\n              may apply to any competent judicial authority for interim  or\n              conservatory measures.  The  application  of  a  party  to  a\n              judicial   authority   for   such   measures   or   for   the\n              implementation of any such measures ordered  by  an  Arbitral\n              Tribunal shall not be deemed  to  be  an  infringement  or  a\n              waiver of the arbitration agreement and shall not affect  the\n              relevant powers reserved to the Arbitral Tribunal.  Any  such\n              application and any measures taken by the judicial  authority\n              must be  notified  without  delay  to  the  Secretariat.

Therefore, in such cases an application  can  be  made\n           under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 9</a> of the said Act.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"75785\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_13\">9.

The learned Senior Counsel for the respondent based on para\n           26 submitted that in the case of foreign award which was  passed\n           outside India is  not  enforceable  in  India  by  invoking  the\n           provisions of the Act or <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_36\">CPC</a>. However, after  critical  analysis\n           of para 26, we are unable to accept the argument of the  learned\n           Senior Counsel for the respondent. Paras  26  and  27  start  by\n           dealing with the arguments of Mr Sen who argued that Part  I  is\n           not applicable to foreign awards. It is  only  in  the  sentence\n           starting at the bottom of para  26  that  the  phrase  &quot;it  must\n           immediately be clarified&quot; that  the  finding  of  the  Court  is\n           rendered. That finding is to  the  effect  that  an  express  or\n           implied agreement of parties can exclude  the  applicability  of\n           Part  I.  The  finding  specifically  states:  &quot;But  if  not  so\n           excluded, the provisions of  Part  I  will  also  apply  to  all\n           &#x27;foreign awards&#x27;.&quot; This exception which is carved out, based  on\n           agreement of the parties,  in  para  21  (placita  e  to  f)  is\n           extracted below: (<a href=\"/doc/110552/\" id=\"a_37\">Bhatia International</a> case SCC p. 119e to f)\n\n\n                 &quot;21. ... By omitting to provide that Part I will not  apply\n                 to international commercial arbitrations which  take  place\n                 outside India the effect would be that Part  I  would  also\n                 apply to international commercial arbitrations held out  of\n                 India.  But  by  not  specifically   providing   that   the\n                 provisions of Part  I  apply  to  international  commercial\n                 arbitrations held  out  of  India,  the  intention  of  the\n                 legislature appears to be to ally (sic  allow)  parties  to\n                 provide by agreement that Part I or any  provision  therein\n                 will not apply. Thus in respect of arbitrations which  take\n                 place outside India even the  non-derogable  provisions  of\n                 Part I can be excluded.

The very fact that the judgment holds that it would be  open\n           to the parties to exclude the application of the  provisions  of\n           Part  I  by  express  or  implied  agreement,  would  mean  that\n           otherwise the whole of Part I would  apply.  In  any  event,  to\n           apply <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 34</a> to foreign international awards  would  not  be\n           inconsistent with <a href=\"/doc/963351/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 48</a> of the Act, or any other  provision\n           of Part II as a situation may arise, where, even in  respect  of\n           properties situate in India and where an award would be  invalid\n           if opposed to the public policy of  India,  merely  because  the\n           judgment-debtor  resides  abroad,  the  award  can  be  enforced\n           against properties in India through personal compliance  of  the\n           judgment-debtor and by holding out the threat of contempt as  is\n           being sought to be done in the present case. In such  an  event,\n           the judgment-debtor cannot [pic]be deprived of his  right  under\n           <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 34</a> to invoke the public policy of India,  to  set  aside\n           the award. As observed  earlier,  the  public  policy  of  India\n           includes - (a) the fundamental  policy  of  India;  or  (b)  the\n           interests of India; or  (c)  justice  or  morality;  or  (d)  in\n           addition, if it is patently illegal. This extended definition of\n           public policy can be bypassed by taking the award to  a  foreign\n           country for enforcement.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_16\">After so holding the Court dealt with  the  contentions  of  the\n      learned senior counsel who highlighted the concept  of  &#x27;transfer&#x27;  of\n      shares and the procedure involved therein under the  <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_41\">Indian  Companies\n      Act, 1956</a> and the impact of <a href=\"/doc/600757/\" id=\"a_42\">Foreign Exchange Management Act, 1999</a>  and\n      adverted to the impact and effect of the legal and regulatory scrutiny\n      under  both  the  Act  and  accepted  the  submission.

On behalf of the appellant, the  issue  of  maintainability  was\n      raised.  The High Court answered the issue in the following manner:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">           &quot;Upon consideration of the entire matter,  the  High  Court  has\n           held that undoubtedly the governing law  of  the  contract  i.e.\n           proper law of the contract is the law of India.  Therefore,  the\n           parties never intended to altogether exclude the laws of  India,\n           so far as contractual rights are concerned. The laws of  England\n           are limited in their applicability in  relation  to  arbitration\n           agreement contained in <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_79\">Article 33.</a>  This  would  mean  that  the\n           English law would be applicable only with regard to  the  curial\n           law matters i.e. conduct of the arbitral  proceedings.  For  all\n           other matters, proper law of the contract would  be  applicable.\n           Relying on <a href=\"/doc/1942013/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 15(1)</a>, it has been held that the fiscal  laws\n           of India cannot be derogated from. Therefore, the  exclusion  of\n           Indian public policy was not envisaged by  the  parties  at  the\n           time when they entered into the contract. The High <a href=\"/doc/156247141/\" id=\"a_81\">Court further\n           held</a> that to hold that the agreement  contained  in  <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_82\">Article  33</a>\n           would envisage the matters other than procedure  of  arbitration\n           proceedings would be to rewrite the  contract.  The  High  Court\n           also held that the question of arbitrability  of  the  claim  or\n           dispute cannot be examined  solely  on  the  touchstone  of  the\n           applicability of the law relating to arbitration of any  country\n           but applying the public policy under the laws of the country  to\n           which the parties have subjected the contract  to  be  governed.\n           Therefore,  according  to  the  High  Court,  the  question   of\n           arbitrability  of  the  dispute  is  not  a  pure  question   of\n           applicable law of arbitration or lex arbitri but  a  larger  one\n           governing the public policy.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_26\">20.

The  parties  have  also\n      agreed that the hearing of the notice for arbitration may  take  place\n      at Paris,  France,  Singapore  or  any  other  location  the  Tribunal\n      considers may be convenient.  The Court posed the question whether  in\n      the factual matrix, there has been express or implied exclusion of the\n      applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_84\">Part I of  the  Act</a>.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_27\">In  that  context,  the  Court\n      referred to paragraph 32 of <a href=\"/doc/110552/\" id=\"a_85\">Bhatia International</a> case and, thereafter,\n      analysed the relevant  articles  of  the  PSC  to  discover  the  real\n      intention of the parties as to whether the provisions of the  Act  had\n      been excluded.   The Court referred to <a href=\"/doc/846967/\" id=\"a_86\">Articles  32.1</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1566826/\" id=\"a_87\">32.2</a>  that\n      dealt with the applicable law and language of the  contract.   <a href=\"/doc/846967/\" id=\"a_88\">Article\n      32.1</a> provided that the proper law of the  contract  would  be  law  of\n      India and under <a href=\"/doc/1566826/\" id=\"a_89\">Article 32.2</a> made a declaration none of the provisions\n      contained in the contract would entitle either the Government  or  the\n      contractor to exercise the rights,  privileges  and  powers  conferred\n      upon it by the contract in a manner which would contravene the laws of\n      India.  The Court observed that the basis of controversy  involved  in\n      the case pertain to analysis of the anatomy of the <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_90\">Article 33.12</a> which\n      provided that venue of the arbitration shall be London  and  that  the\n      arbitration agreement shall be governed by the laws of England.   That\n      apart, the parties had agreed that juridical seat or  legal  place  of\n      arbitration for the purpose initiated under the claimants&#x27;  notice  of\n      arbitration would be at London.   The Court posed the question whether\n      such stipulations excluded the applicability of the Act or  not.   The\n      Court repelling  the  contention  that  clauses  do  not  exclude  the\n      applicability of the 1996 Act, observed thus:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_28\">&quot;In our opinion, the expression  &quot;laws  of  India&quot;  as  used  in\n           <a href=\"/doc/846967/\" id=\"a_91\">Articles 32.1</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1566826/\" id=\"a_92\">32.2</a> has a reference only to  the  contractual\n           obligations to be performed by the parties under the substantive\n           contract i.e. PSC. In other words, the provisions  contained  in\n           <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_93\">Article 33.12</a> are not governed by the  provisions  contained  in\n           <a href=\"/doc/846967/\" id=\"a_94\">Article 32.1.</a> It must be emphasised that <a href=\"/doc/846967/\" id=\"a_95\">Article 32.1</a>  has  been\n           made subject to the provision of <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_96\">Article  33.12.</a>  <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_97\">Article  33.12</a>\n           specifically provides that the arbitration  agreement  shall  be\n           governed by the laws of England. The two articles are particular\n           in laying down that the contractual obligations with  regard  to\n           the exploration of oil and gas under the PSC shall  be  governed\n           and interpreted  in  accordance  with  the  laws  of  India.  In\n           contradistinction, <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_98\">Article 33.12</a> specifically provides that  the\n           arbitration  agreement  contained  in  <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_99\">Article  33.12</a>  shall  be\n           governed by the laws of England. Therefore, in our opinion,  the\n           conclusion is inescapable that applicability of the  <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_100\">Arbitration\n           Act, 1996</a> has  been  ruled  out  by  a  conscious  decision  and\n           agreement of the parties. Applying the ratio of law as <a href=\"/doc/110552/\" id=\"a_101\">laid down\n           in</a> Bhatia International it would lead to the conclusion that the\n           Delhi High Court had no jurisdiction to entertain  the  petition\n           under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_102\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1045460\" id=\"span_29\">21.   After so stating, the Court opined that it is too  late  in  the\n      day to contend that the seat of arbitration is  not  analogous  to  an\n      exclusive jurisdiction  clause.   Once  the  parties  had  consciously\n      agreed that juridical seat of the arbitration would be London and that\n      the agreement would be governed by the  laws  of  London,  it  was  no\n      longer open to contend that provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_103\">Part I of the Act</a> would also\n      be applicable to the arbitration agreement.  The Court referred to the\n      decision in <a href=\"/doc/1045460/\" id=\"a_104\">Videocon Industries Ltd. v. Union of India</a>[9].</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1045460\" id=\"span_30\">Referring\n      to clause in the <a href=\"/doc/1045460/\" id=\"a_105\">Videocon Industries Ltd.</a> (supra), the Court proceeded\n      to state that:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">           47. ....The first issue raised in Videocon Industries  Ltd.  was\n           as to whether the  seat  of  arbitration  was  London  or  Kuala\n           Lumpur. The second issue was with  regard  to  the  courts  that\n           would  have  supervisory  jurisdiction  over   the   arbitration\n           proceedings. Firstly, the plea of Videocon Industries  Ltd.  was\n           that the seat could not have been changed from Kuala  Lumpur  to\n           London only on agreement of the parties without  there  being  a\n           corresponding amendment in the PSC. This plea was  accepted.  It\n           was held that seat of arbitration  cannot  be  changed  by  mere\n           agreement of parties.  In  para  21  of  the  judgment,  it  was\n           observed as follows: (SCC p. 170)\n\n\n                 &quot;21. Though, it may appear repetitive, we deem it necessary\n              to mention that as per the terms of agreement,  the  seat  of\n              arbitration was Kuala Lumpur. If the parties wanted to  amend\n              <a href=\"/doc/846153/\" id=\"a_106\">Article 34.12</a>, they could have done  so  only  by  a  written\n              instrument which was required to be signed by  all  of  them.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">              Admittedly, neither  was  there  any  agreement  between  the\n              parties to the PSC to shift the juridical seat of arbitration\n              from Kuala Lumpur to London nor was  any  written  instrument\n              signed by them for amending  <a href=\"/doc/846153/\" id=\"a_107\">Article  34.12.</a>  Therefore,  the\n              mere fact that the parties to the particular arbitration  had\n              agreed for shifting of the  seat  of  arbitration  to  London\n              cannot be interpreted as anything except physical  change  of\n              the venue of arbitration from Kuala Lumpur to London.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">           48.

This\n           issue was decided against the Union of India  and  it  was  held\n           that the Delhi High Court  did  not  have  the  jurisdiction  to\n           entertain the petition filed by the Union of India under <a href=\"/doc/1120409/\" id=\"a_109\">Section\n           9</a> of the Arbitration Act.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1045460\" id=\"span_31\">22.

In  that\n      case, the laws or rules chosen by  the  parties  would  prevail.   Any\n      provision, in Part I, which is contrary to or excluded by that law  or\n      rules will not apply.  Elaborating further, it proceeded to  lay  down\n      thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">           &quot;In this case, the parties have by agreement provided  that  the\n           juridical seat of arbitration will be in London.

On the basis of the agreement and the consent  of  the\n           parties, the Arbitral  Tribunal  has  made  the  &quot;final  partial\n           consent award&quot; on 14-9-2011 fixing the juridical seat (or  legal\n           place) of arbitration for the purposes of arbitration  initiated\n           under the claimants&#x27; notice of arbitration dated  16-12-2010  in\n           London, England. To make it even further clear  that  the  award\n           also records that any hearing in the arbitration may take  place\n           in Paris, France, Singapore or any other location  the  Tribunal\n           considers convenient. <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_139\">Article 33.12</a> stipulates that  arbitration\n           [pic]proceedings shall be conducted  in  English  language.

A combined effect of all  these  factors\n           would clearly show that the parties have  by  express  agreement\n           excluded the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_141\">Part I  of  the  Arbitration  Act,\n           1996</a> (Indian) to the arbitration proceedings.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_44\">27.

As noticed earlier, <a href=\"/doc/846967/\" id=\"a_144\">Article  32.1</a>  itself  provides\n           that it shall be subject to  the  provision  of  <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_145\">Article  33.12.</a>\n           <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_146\">Article 33.12</a> provides that the arbitration agreement  contained\n           in this article shall be governed by the laws  of  England.  The\n           term &quot;laws of England&quot; cannot  be  given  a  restricted  meaning\n           confined to only curial law. It is permissible under law for the\n           parties to provide for different laws of the  contract  and  the\n           arbitration agreement and the curial law. In  Naviera  Amazonica\n           Peruana SA v. Compania Internacional De  Seguros  Del  Peru[16],\n           the Court of Appeal in England  considered  an  agreement  which\n           contained a clause providing for the jurisdiction of the  courts\n           in Lima, Peru in the event [pic]of judicial dispute and  at  the\n           same time contained a  clause  providing  that  the  arbitration\n           would be governed by the English law and the procedural  law  of\n           arbitration shall be  the  English  law.  The  Court  of  Appeal\n           observed as follows:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                 All contracts which provide for arbitration and  contain  a\n              foreign  element  may  involve  three  potentially   relevant\n              systems  of  law:  (1)  the  law  governing  the  substantive\n              contract; (2) the law governing the  agreement  to  arbitrate\n              and the performance of that agreement; (3) the law  governing\n              the conduct of the arbitration. In the majority of cases  all\n              three will be the same. But (1) will often be different  from\n              (2) and (3). And occasionally, but rarely (2) may also differ\n              from (3).\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">           70. From the above, it is  evident  that  it  was  open  to  the\n           parties to agree that the law governing the substantive contract\n           (PSC) would be different from the law governing the  arbitration\n           agreement. This is precisely the situation in the present  case.\n           <a href=\"/doc/846967/\" id=\"a_147\">Article 32.1</a> specifically provides that the performance  of  the\n           contractual obligations under the  PSC  would  be  governed  and\n           interpreted under the laws of India. So far as  the  alternative\n           dispute redressal agreement i.e. the  arbitration  agreement  is\n           concerned, it would be governed by the laws of England. There is\n           no basis on which the respondents can be heard to say  that  the\n           applicability of laws of England related only to the conduct  of\n           arbitration reference. The law  governing  the  conduct  of  the\n           arbitration is interchangeably referred to as the curial law  or\n           procedural law or the lex fori. The  delineation  of  the  three\n           operative  laws  as  given  in  Naviera   Amazonica   has   been\n           specifically followed by this Court in Sumitomo. The Court also,\n           upon a survey, of a number of decisions rendered by the  English\n           courts and after referring to the  views  expressed  by  learned\n           commentators on international commercial  arbitration  concluded\n           that:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">                 16. The law which would apply to the filing of  the  award,\n              to its enforcement and to its setting aside would be the  law\n              governing the agreement to arbitrate and the  performance  of\n              that agreement.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"563448\" id=\"span_45\">28.   After so holding, the  Court  referred  to  the  legal  position\n      stated in <a href=\"/doc/563448/\" id=\"a_148\">Dozco</a>&#x27;s case wherein it has been ruled thus:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"216597\" id=\"span_46\">&quot;In the backdrop of these conflicting claims, the question boils\n           down to as to what is the true  interpretation  of  <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_149\">Article  23.</a>\n           This <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_150\">Article 23</a> will have to be read in the backdrop of  <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_151\">Article\n           22</a> and more particularly, <a href=\"/doc/1293832/\" id=\"a_152\">Article 22.1.</a> It  is  clear  from  the\n           language of <a href=\"/doc/1293832/\" id=\"a_153\">Article 22.1</a>  that  the  whole  agreement  would  be\n           governed by and construed in accordance with  the  laws  of  The\n           Republic of Korea. It is for this  reason  that  the  respondent\n           heavily relied on the law <a href=\"/doc/563448/\" id=\"a_154\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/216597/\" id=\"a_155\">Sumitomo Heavy Industries\n           Ltd. v. ONGC Ltd. This</a> judgment is a complete authority  on  the\n           proposition that the arbitrability  of  the  dispute  is  to  be\n           determined in terms of the law governing  arbitration  agreement\n           and  the  arbitration  proceedings  have  to  be  conducted   in\n           accordance with the curial law. This Court,  in  that  judgment,\n           relying on Mustill and Boyd: The Law and Practice of  Commercial\n           Arbitration in England, 2nd Edn., observed in para 15 that where\n           the law governing the conduct of the reference is different from\n           the law governing  the  underlying  arbitration  agreement,  the\n           court looks to the arbitration agreement to see if  the  dispute\n           is arbitrable, then to the curial law to see how  the  reference\n           should be conducted, &quot;and then returns to the first law in order\n           to give effect to the resulting award&quot;. In para 16, this  Court,\n           in no uncertain terms, declared that the law which  would  apply\n           to the filing of the  award,  to  its  enforcement  and  to  its\n           setting aside would  be  the  law  governing  the  agreement  to\n           arbitrate and the performance of that agreement.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">            The said view was accepted by the two-Judge Bench.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">      29.   Eventually, the Court dislodged the decision of the  High  Court\n      of Delhi stating that:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">           &quot;76.2. We further overrule and set aside the conclusion  of  the\n           High Court that, even though the arbitration agreement would  be\n           governed by the laws of England and that the juridical  seat  of\n           arbitration would be in <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_156\">London, Part I of  the  Arbitration  Act</a>\n           would still be applicable as the laws governing the  substantive\n           contract are Indian laws.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">           76.3. In the event a final award is made against the respondent,\n           the enforceability of the same in India can be resisted  on  the\n           ground of public policy.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">           76.4. The conclusion of the High Court that in  the  event,  the\n           award is sought to be enforced outside India, it would leave the\n           Indian party remediless is without any basis as the parties have\n           consensually provided that the  arbitration  agreement  will  be\n           governed by the English law. Therefore, the remedy  against  the\n           award will have to be sought in  England,  where  the  juridical\n           seat is located.  However,  we  accept  the  submission  of  the\n           appellant that since the substantive law governing the  contract\n           is  Indian  law,  even  the  courts  in  England,  in  case  the\n           arbitrability is challenged, will have to decide  the  issue  by\n           applying Indian law viz. the principle of public policy, etc. as\n           it prevails in Indian law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">      30.   We have dealt with <a href=\"/doc/216597/\" id=\"a_157\">the said decision</a> as it has taken note of all\n      the pronouncements in the field and further, Mr. Giri, learned  senior\n      counsel appearing for the respondents would heavily rely on it and Mr.\n      Viwanathan, learned senior counsel would leave no  stone  unturned  to\n      distinguish the same on the factual foundation especially in reference\n      to the arbitration clause.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"75785\" id=\"span_47\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"156247141\" id=\"span_48\">31.

First, we shall advert to the first proposition.   There  is  no\n      cavil over the principle stated in <a href=\"/doc/110552/\" id=\"a_168\">Bhatia International</a>  (supra)  that\n      <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_169\">Part I of the Act</a> is applicable to  arbitrations  held  outside  India\n      unless the parties have either expressly  or  impliedly  excluded  the\n      provisions of the Act.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"997135\" id=\"span_54\">Mr. Vishwanathan, learned senior  counsel  has\n      submitted in the case at hand  there  is  no  express  exclusion,  for\n      clause remotely does not suggest so.  For the  said  purpose,  he  has\n      commended us to the decisions in <a href=\"/doc/997135/\" id=\"a_170\">A.B.C. Laminart Pvt. Ltd. and Anr. v.\n      A.P.  Agencies</a>,  Salem[17]  and  Rajasthan  SEB  v.  Universal  Petrol\n      Chemicals Ltd.[18] It is also urged by him that the stipulation in the\n      agreement does not even remotely impliedly exclude the jurisdiction of\n      the Indian courts.  He would submit that to  apply  the  principle  of\n      implied exclusion, the Court has to test the &quot;presumed intention&quot;  and\n      in such a situation, it is the duty of the Court to adopt an objective\n      approach, that is to say,  what  would  have  been  the  intention  of\n      reasonable parties in the  position  of  the  actual  parties  to  the\n      contract.  Learned senior counsel would also contend that the  concept\n      of fair result has to be kept in view while construing a contract.  To\n      buttress the aforesaid submissions, he has drawn inspiration from  Kim\n      Lewison&#x27;s The Interpretation of Contracts, pages 26, 41, 110  and  217\n      wherein various judgments have been referred.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"156247141\" id=\"span_55\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"563448\" id=\"span_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1045460\" id=\"span_57\">35.

In contrast, there is\n           no provision in the Act under which the Arbitral Tribunal  could\n           change the juridical seat  of  arbitration  which,  as  per  the\n           agreement of the parties,  was  Kuala  Lumpur.  Therefore,  mere\n           change in the physical venue of the hearing from Kuala Lumpur to\n           Amsterdam and London did not amount to change in  the  juridical\n           seat of arbitration.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_54\">            Eventually, the Court in the said case has ruled thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">           &quot;In  the  present  case  also,  the  parties  had  agreed   that\n           notwithstanding  <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_175\">Article   33.1</a>,   the   arbitration   agreement\n           contained in <a href=\"/doc/846153/\" id=\"a_176\">Article 34</a> shall be governed by  laws  of  England.\n           This necessarily implies that the parties had agreed to  exclude\n           the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_177\">Part I of the Act</a>. As a corollary to the above\n           conclusion, we hold that the Delhi High Court did not  have  the\n           jurisdiction to entertain the petition filed by the  respondents\n           under <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_178\">Section 9</a> of the Act and the mere fact that the  appellant\n           had earlier filed similar petitions was not sufficient to clothe\n           that High Court with the jurisdiction to entertain the  petition\n           filed by the respondents.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">      37.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"563448\" id=\"span_59\">In <a href=\"/doc/563448/\" id=\"a_179\">Dozco</a> (supra), the Court referred to <a href=\"/doc/581566/\" id=\"a_180\">Article 22</a>  and  <a href=\"/doc/1071750/\" id=\"a_181\">Article\n      23</a>  of  the  agreement,  which  dealt  with  the  governing  laws  and\n      arbitration.   <a href=\"/doc/1293832/\" id=\"a_182\">Article  22.1</a>  in  the  said  case  provided  that  the\n      agreement shall be governed by and construed in  accordance  with  the\n      laws of the  Republic  of  Korea.</span>   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"633347\" id=\"span_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1194084\" id=\"span_61\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1679578\" id=\"span_62\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_63\"><a href=\"/doc/705639/\" id=\"a_183\">Article  23.1</a>,  which  dealt  with\n      arbitration, stipulated that all disputes arising in  connection  with\n      the agreement, shall be finally settled by arbitration in Seoul, Korea\n      or such other place as the parties may agree in writing,  pursuant  to\n      the rules of agreement then in force of the I.C.C.

It seems clear that  the  submissions  advanced  below\n              confused the legal &#x27;seat&#x27;, etc. of an  arbitration  with  the\n              geographically  convenient  place  or  places   for   holding\n              hearings. This distinction is nowadays a  common  feature  of\n              international arbitrations  and  is  helpfully  explained  in\n              Redfern and Hunter in the following passage under the heading\n              &#x27;The Place of Arbitration&#x27;:\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">                 &#x27;The preceding discussion has been on the basis that  there\n                 is only one &quot;place&quot; of arbitration. This will be the  place\n                 chosen by or on behalf of  the  parties;  and  it  will  be\n                 designated in the arbitration agreement  or  the  terms  of\n                 reference or the minutes of proceedings or  in  some  other\n                 way as the place or &quot;seat&quot; of the  arbitration.  This  does\n                 not mean, however, that the Arbitral Tribunal must hold all\n                 its meetings or  hearings  at  the  place  of  arbitration.\n                 International commercial arbitration often involves  people\n                 of  many  different  nationalities,  from  many   different\n                 countries. In  these  circumstances,  it  is  by  no  means\n                 unusual for an Arbitral Tribunal to hold meetings - or even\n                 hearings - in a place other than the  designated  place  of\n                 arbitration, either for its  own  convenience  or  for  the\n                 convenience of the parties or their witnesses....\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">                 It may be more convenient for an Arbitral Tribunal  sitting\n                 in one country to conduct a hearing in  another  country  -\n                 for instance, for the purpose  of  taking  evidence....  In\n                 such circumstances, each move of the Arbitral Tribunal does\n                 not of  itself  mean  that  the  seat  of  the  arbitration\n                 changes. The seat of  the  arbitration  remains  the  place\n                 initially agreed by or on behalf of the parties.&#x27;\n              These aspects need to be borne in mind when one comes to  the\n              Judge&#x27;s construction of this policy.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">           It would be clear from this that the bracketed  portion  in  the\n           article was not for deciding upon the seat of  the  arbitration,\n           but for the convenience of the parties in case they find to hold\n           the arbitration proceedings somewhere else  than  Seoul,  Korea.\n           The part which has been  quoted  above  from  Naviera  Amazonica\n           Peruana S.A. v.

In  that\n      context, it referred to the agreement in the contract, namely, Clauses\n      27 and 28.  In that context the Court opined that:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">           &quot;..... As indicated hereinabove, Clause 28  indicates  that  the\n           governing law of the agreement would be the law  of  India  i.e.\n           the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_198\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>. The learned  counsel\n           for the parties have quite correctly spelt out  the  distinction\n           between the &quot;proper law&quot; of the contract and the &quot;curial law&quot; to\n           determine the law which is to  govern  the  arbitration  itself.\n           While the proper law is the  law  which  governs  the  agreement\n           itself,  in  the  absence  of  any  other  stipulation  in   the\n           arbitration clause as to which law would apply in respect of the\n           arbitral proceedings, it is now well settled that it is the  law\n           governing the contract which would also be the law applicable to\n           the Arbitral Tribunal itself. Clause 27.1 makes it  quite  clear\n           that the curial law which regulates the procedure to be  adopted\n           in conducting the arbitration would be the SIAC Rules. There is,\n           therefore, no ambiguity that the SIAC Rules would be the  curial\n           law of the arbitration proceedings. It  also  happens  that  the\n           parties had agreed to make Singapore the  seat  of  arbitration.\n           Clause 27.1 indicates that the arbitration proceedings are to be\n           conducted in accordance with the SIAC Rules.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">                                                         [Emphasis supplied]\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_69\">39.

Coming to the stipulations in the present arbitration clause, it\n      is clear as day that if any dispute or difference  would  arise  under\n      the charter, arbitration in London to apply; that the arbitrators  are\n      to  be  commercial  men  who  are  members   of   London   Arbitration\n      Association; the contract is to be construed and governed  by  English\n      Law; and that the arbitration should be conducted, if the claim is for\n      a lesser sum, in accordance with small claims procedure of the  London\n      Maritime Arbitration Association.   There is no other provision in the\n      agreement that any other law would govern the arbitration clause.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">      42.   Mr. Giri, learned senior counsel  would  submit  that  from  the\n      clause which is a comprehensive one, it is London, which is  the  seat\n      of arbitration.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1045460\" id=\"span_75\">In <a href=\"/doc/1045460/\" id=\"a_212\">Videocon  Industries  Ltd.</a>  (supra),  as  we  have\n      analysed earlier, <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_213\">Article 33.1</a> of the agreement which stipulated  that\n      subject to the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/846153/\" id=\"a_214\">Article  34.12</a>,  the  contract  would  be\n      governed and interpreted in accordance with the laws of India.  Clause\n      34.12 of the agreement read as follows:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">           &quot;34.12.

Notwithstanding the provisions  of  <a href=\"/doc/829916/\" id=\"a_215\">Article  33.1</a>,  the\n           arbitration agreement contained in  this  <a href=\"/doc/846153/\" id=\"a_216\">Article  34</a>  shall  be\n           governed by the laws of England.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">      43.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_76\">In that context, the Court referred to Section 3 of the  English\n      Arbitration Act, 1996 and as has been stated earlier, opined  that  as\n      per the English law, the seat of arbitration as per the said provision\n      would mean &quot;juridical seat of arbitration&quot; and accordingly opined that\n      principles  stated  in  <a href=\"/doc/110552/\" id=\"a_217\">Bhatia  International</a>  (supra)  would  not  be\n      applicable.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">      44.   In the present case, the agreement stipulates that the  contract\n      is to be governed and construed according to the  English  law.   This\n      occurs in the arbitration clause.  Mr.  Vishwanathan,  learned  senior\n      counsel, would submit that this part has to be interpreted as  a  part\n      of &quot;curial law&quot; and not as a &quot;proper law&quot; or &quot;substantive law&quot;.  It is\n      his submission that it cannot be equated with the seat of arbitration.\n       As we perceive, it forms as a part of the arbitration clause.   There\n      is ample indication  through  various  phrases  like  &quot;arbitration  in\n      London to apply&quot;, arbitrators are to be the  members  of  the  &quot;London\n      Arbitration  Association&quot;  and  the  contract  &quot;to  be  governed   and\n      construed according to English Law&quot;.  It is worth noting that there is\n      no other stipulation relating to the applicability of any law  to  the\n      agreement.  There is no other clause anywhere in the  contract.   That\n      apart, it is also postulated that if the dispute is for an amount less\n      that  US  $  50000  then,  the  arbitration  should  be  conducted  in\n      accordance  with  small  claims  procedure  of  the  London   Maritime\n      Arbitration Association.  When the aforesaid stipulations are read and\n      appreciated in the contextual perspective, &quot;the presumed intention&quot; of\n      the parties is clear as crystal that the juridical seat of arbitration\n      would be London.  In this context, a  passage  from  Mitsubishi  Heavy\n      Industries Ltd. v. Gulf Bank[21] is worth reproducing:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">           &quot;It is of course  both  useful  and  frequently  necessary  when\n           construing a clause in a contract to have regard to the  overall\n           commercial purpose of the contract in the  broad  sense  of  the\n           type and general content, the relationship of  the  parties  and\n           such common commercial purpose as may clearly emerge  from  such\n           an exercise.  However, it does not seem to me  to  be  a  proper\n           approach to the construction of a default clause in a commercial\n           contract to  seek  or  purport  to  elicit  some  self-contained\n           &#x27;commercial purpose&#x27; underlying the clause which is  or  may  be\n           wider than the ordinary or usual construction of  the  words  of\n           each sub-clause will yield.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_68\">      45.   In  Cargill  International  S.A.  v.  Bangladesh  Sugar  &amp;  Food\n      Industries Corp.[22], Potter L.J.  balanced  the  two  approaches  and\n      said:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">           &quot;In this connection [counsel] has rightly made the  point  that,\n           when construing the effect of particular words in  a  commercial\n           contract, it is wrong to put a label on the contract in  advance\n           and this to approach the question of construction on  the  basis\n           of a pre-conception as to the contact&#x27;s  intended  effect,  with\n           the result that a strained  construction  is  placed  on  words,\n           clear in themselves, in order  to  fit  them  within  such  pre-\n           conception...\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">                 On the  other  hand,  modern  principles  of  construction\n           require the court to have regard to the  commercial  background,\n           the context of the contract ad the circumstances of the parties,\n           and to consider whether, against  that  background  and  I  that\n           context, to give the words a particular  or  restricted  meaning\n           would lead to an apparently unreasonable and unfair result.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_69\">      46.   Thus, interpreting the clause in question on the bedrock of  the\n      aforesaid principles it is vivid that the intended effect is  to  have\n      the seat of arbitration at London.   The  commercial  background,  the\n      context of the contract and the circumstances of the  parties  and  in\n      the background in which the contract was  entered  into,  irresistibly\n      lead in that direction.  We are not impressed by the  submission  that\n      by such interpretation it will put the respondent in  an  advantageous\n      position.  Therefore, we think it would be  appropriate  to  interpret\n      the clause that it is a proper clause or substantial clause and not  a\n      curial or a procedural one by which the arbitration proceedings are to\n      be conducted and hence, we are disposed to  think  that  the  seat  of\n      arbitration will be at London.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_70\">      47.   Having said that  the  implied  exclusion  principle  stated  in\n      Bhatia International (supra) would be applicable, regard being had  to\n      the clause in the agreement, there  is  no  need  to  dwell  upon  the\n      contention raised pertaining to the addendum, for  any  interpretation\n      placed on the said document would  not  make  any  difference  to  the\n      ultimate conclusion that we have already arrived at.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_71\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"173015163\" id=\"span_77\">48.   Before parting with the case, it is obligatory on  our  part  to\n      state that the Division Bench  of  the  High  Court  has  allowed  the\n      petition on the foundation that the <a href=\"/doc/173015163/\" id=\"a_218\">Bharat Aluminium  Co.</a>  case  would\n      govern the field and, therefore, the court below had  no  jurisdiction\n      is not correct.</span>  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110552\" id=\"span_78\">But as has been analysed and discussed  by  us,  even\n      applying the principles <a href=\"/doc/173015163/\" id=\"a_219\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/110552/\" id=\"a_220\">Bhatia International</a> (supra)  and\n      scanning the anatomy of the arbitration clause, we have arrived at the\n      conclusion that the courts in India  will  not  have  jurisdiction  as\n      there is implied exclusion.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">      49.    Consequently,  for  different  reasons,  we  concur  with   the\n      conclusion arrived at by the High Court and accordingly,  the  appeal,\n      being sans  merit,  stands  dismissed.
