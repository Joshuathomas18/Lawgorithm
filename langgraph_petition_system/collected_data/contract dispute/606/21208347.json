A bare perusal of\nthe said clause would show that no such requirement is envisaged\nunder the contract and such an interpretation could have been\nmade by any reasonable person, because it has been ONGC&#x27;s\ncase that Clause 7.4 would not have been attracted to imposition\nof NPD&#x27;s as the same would not be disputed portion, but merely a\ncomponent of calculating the payment to be released.

It is further stated that the Clause 7.4 is not applicable in the\npresent case because the said clause only deals with the disputed\ninvoices. In this case the deduction on account of NPDs is not\ndisputed as it is a contractual formality for calculating the\npayments which is given under Clause 1.1.1 of the Special Terms\nof the Contract which takes precedence over the General Terms\nof Contract in any manner. The Award is found having been\npassed while ignoring the relevant clauses of the contract i.e.\nClause 1.1.1 and relying upon the irrelevant clause of GCC, is\nliable to be set aside on this ground alone.

It is further stated that the claimant in\nthe present case however included NPDs effected by the\nRespondent for the first four quarters of the contract period, i.e.,\nfrom 05.03.2010 to 04.03.2011. Payments against invoices raised\nby the claimant for these periods were made on 21.10.2011 (1st\nQuarter), 19.01.2012 (2nd Quarter), 01.03.2012 (3rd Quarter)\nand 16.05.2012 (4th Quarter). The notice invoking arbitration\ndated 18.11.2015 which was issued more than three years after\nthese payments had been made and the claimant had knowledge\nof the imposition of NPDs. Therefore, the claim is barred with\nrespect to the imposition of the NPDs in the first 4 quarters. The\nLearned Arbitrator has therefore, given a patently illegal finding\non this issue.

There is nothing\n                          on record in this regard. Arguments\n                          have been advanced by learned counsel\n                          for both the parties with regard to the\n                          suitability of an equipment which was\n                          replaced immediately as per the PM\n                          Report. According to the Respondent,\n                          the replacement of an equipment has to\n                          be of the same or equivalent make and\n                          what was provided as a replacement\n                          equipment was not suitable in terms of\n                          the Contract. I am afraid, this argument\n                          does not find support from the PM\n                          Reports.

The evidence on record is\n                          contrary that the equipment was taken\n                          from the stores which were to be\n                          maintained as per the Contract.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_96\">(ii)            It is further argued that the above findings are based\nupon appreciation of claimant&#x27;s submissions and upon cogent\nappreciation of evidence.

It is\nnot open to the Court to set aside a finding of fact arrived at by\nthe Arbitrator and only grounds on which the award can be set\naside are those mentioned in the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_37\">Arbitration Act</a>. Where the\nArbitrator assigns cogent grounds and sufficient reasons and no\nerror of law or misconduct is cited, the award will not call for\ninterference by the Court in exercise of the power vested in it.\nWhere the Arbitrator is a qualified technical person and expert,\nwho is competent to make assessment by taking into\nconsideration the technical aspects of the matter, the Court would\ngenerally not interfere with the award passed by the Arbitrator.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_108\">14.
