In this regard, the bid submitted by the writ applicant was\naccepted and finalized by the Corporation. In accordance with the Letter\nof Award (LOA), the Corporation was to undertake the work of design,\nengineering, manufacture, shop testing, packing and forwarding,\nmodification, loading / unloading, storage at site, insurance, erection,\ncompletion of work with PG Tests including civil works, for supply,\ninstallation, commissioning and testing of FGD system for 800\nMegawatts Unit No.8 of Wanakbori TPS within three years.

The position as on\ndate is that the writ applicant has not been in a position to adhere to the\ntime period as prescribed in the agreement. It is the case of the writ\napplicant that it is a Chinese Company and on account of the COVID-19\npandemic, it had to face a lot of difficulties, on account of which, the\nwork of contract could not be started and completed in accordance with\nthe terms and conditions.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">8     The aforesaid dispute led to issue of a show cause notice by the\nCorporation dated 10th November 2021 to the writ applicant. The writ\napplicant has been called upon to show cause as to why the contract /\nwork order allotted vide LOA dated 16 th March 2019 for Supply,\nInstallation, Commissioning and Testing of the the FGD system for 800\nMegawatts Unit No.8 of Wanakbori TPS with three years comprehensive\nO&amp;M contract - supply order thereof and the LOA for Erection, Testing\nand Commissioning thereof (work order) of the even date be not\ncancelled and the performance Bank Guarantee be not revoked and the\nfurther execution of the supply order and erection, testing and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                 Page 4 of 11</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                        Downloaded on : Wed Jan 12 04:04:52 IST 2022</span>\n      C/SCA/17338/2021                                ORDER DATED: 24/11/2021\n\n\n\ncommissioning work order shall not be carried out at the risk, cost and\nconsequences of the writ applicant.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">9      The writ applicant has a strong apprehension that the Corporation\nmay, now at any point of time, revoke the Bank Guarantee and in such\ncircumstances, has come to this Court with the present writ application\npraying for appropriate reliefs.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">10     We have heard Mr. Mihir Thakore, the learned Senior Counsel\nassisted by Mr. Jaimin Dave, the learned counsel appearing for the writ\napplicant and Mr. Dipak R. Dave, the learned counsel appearing for the\nrespondent No.1 - Corporation.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_14\">11     It is not in dispute that till this date, the writ applicant has not\nfiled its reply to the show cause notice. Once an appropriate reply is\nfiled, probably, the Corporation may be in a position to take the final call\nas to whether the contract should be terminated and the performance\nBank Guarantee be revoked. Mr. Thakore, the learned Senior Counsel\nmade himself very clear that at the earliest, an appropriate reply would\nbe filed by his client. However, Mr. Thakore, tried his best to persuade\nus to grant relief as on date against encashment of Bank Guarantee till\nhis client approaches the Gujarat Public Works Contracts Dispute\nArbitration Tribunal and seeks appropriate reliefs under the provisions of\nthe <a href=\"/doc/16512451/\" id=\"a_3\">Gujarat Public Works Contract Disputes Arbitration and Tribunal Act,\n1992</a> (for short, &quot;the Act, 1992&quot;). Mr. Thakore took us through the\nvarious provisions of the Act, 1992, more particularly, <a href=\"/doc/56125947/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 8</a> of the\nAct. <a href=\"/doc/56125947/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 8</a> of the Act reads thus:\n</p>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">       &quot;8.

According to Mr. Thakore, if the Tribunal deems fit to\nadmit the reference under Sub-section (2), it shall, thereafter, proceed to\nrecord the evidence if necessary, and then may pass an appropriate\norder. Although, Sub-section (3) talks about making an award or an\ninterim award, but even an interim relief can be granted by the Tribunal\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                   Page 6 of 11</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                          Downloaded on : Wed Jan 12 04:04:52 IST 2022</span>\n      C/SCA/17338/2021                                   ORDER DATED: 24/11/2021\n\n\n\nhaving regard to the urgency in the matter.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"18689704\" id=\"span_13\">13     Mr. Thakore also invited our attention to the decision of the\nSupreme Court in the case of State of Gujarat through <a href=\"/doc/18689704/\" id=\"a_10\">Chief Secretary\nand another vs. Amber Builders</a> reported in (2020) 2 SCC 540, wherein,\nthe Supreme Court has taken the view that the Gujarat Public Works\nContracts Disputes Arbitration Tribunal has the jurisdiction to make an\ninterim order in terms of <a href=\"/doc/318136/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 17</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996 (for short, &quot;the Act, 1996&quot;).

Part I of the A&amp;C Act i.e. from <a href=\"/doc/187450858/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 2</a> to Section 43 deals with\n       Arbitration and <a href=\"/doc/63915012/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 2(2)</a> clearly states that the said Part would\n       apply to all Arbitrations which take place in India. <a href=\"/doc/187450858/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 2(4)</a> makes it\n       absolutely clear that other than Section 40(1), 41 and 43, Part I of the\n       A&amp;C Act shall apply to all arbitrations even if they are carried out under\n       any other enactment as if the arbitrations were pursuant to an\n       arbitration agreement except insofar as the provisions of Part I are\n       inconsistent with the other enactment or any rules made thereunder. A\n       plain reading would show that the provisions of Part I of the A&amp;C Act\n       would apply to all arbitrations where the place of arbitration is within\n       India. Even statutory arbitrations under other Acts would be governed\n       by Part I. The only exception is that if there is any departure from Part I\n       in the special enactment then the special enactment will prevail and the\n       A&amp;C Act will give way to the special enactment.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">       16.

Basically, the intention\n       of the Stage Legislature was that all disputes relating to works contract\n       between the State Government and the persons executing the works\n       defined as works contract would be compulsorily referred to the\n       Arbitral Tribunal constituted under <a href=\"/doc/195388414/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 3</a> of the Gujarat Act. <a href=\"/doc/127938738/\" id=\"a_20\">Section\n       8(3)</a> clearly provides that where the Tribunal admits a reference under\n       subsection (2) it will make an award or an interim award giving its\n       reasons thereof.

The practice and procedure of the Tribunal is governed by <a href=\"/doc/190820339/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 9</a>\n       of the Act. <a href=\"/doc/169835583/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 12</a> of the Act vests revisional powers in the High\n       Court of Gujarat where an award or any interim award can be\n       challenged on the grounds set out therein. The High Court also has suo\n       motu powers in this regard. <a href=\"/doc/86218701/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 13</a> which is relevant for our\n       purpose reads as follows:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">               &quot;13. Bar of jurisdiction of Courts.:-(1) Save as otherwise\n               provided by <a href=\"/doc/169835583/\" id=\"a_24\">section 12</a>, no Civil Court shall have jurisdiction to\n               deal with or decide any question which the Tribunal is\n               empowered to deal with and decide by or under this Act and no\n               injunction shall be granted by any Civil Court in respect of any\n               action taken or to be taken in pursuance of any power by or\n               under this Act. (2) No award or interim award or order made or\n               proceedings taken under this Act by the Tribunal shall be called\n               in question in any Civil Court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_17\">       <a href=\"/doc/86218701/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 13</a> specifically bars the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts. This\n       clearly means that powers vested in a Civil Court under the A&amp;C Act,\n       such as the powers to grant interim relief in terms of <a href=\"/doc/190820339/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 9</a> of the\n       A&amp;C Act and the powers for setting aside an award under <a href=\"/doc/111212810/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 34</a> of\n       the Act cannot be exercised by Civil Courts insofar as the awards made\n       under the <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_28\">Gujarat Act</a> are concerned. As far as <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_29\">Gujarat Act</a> is concerned,\n       the power to set aside/modify an award is vested in the High Court\n       under <a href=\"/doc/169835583/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 12</a>. <a href=\"/doc/163592972/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 21</a> of the Gujarat Act reads as follows:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">               &quot;21. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_32\">Arbitration Act</a> to cease to apply.- The provisions of the\n               <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_33\">Arbitration Act</a>, shall in so far as they are inconsistent with the\n               provisions of this Act, cease to apply to any dispute arising from\n               a works contract and all arbitration proceedings in relation to\n               such dispute before an arbitrator, umpire, court or authority\n               shall stand transferred to the Tribunal.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">       22. On a conjoint reading and a careful analysis of the Acts together,\n       we are of the view that insofar as the powers vested in the Arbitral\n       Tribunal in terms of the <a href=\"/doc/195675120/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 17</a> of the A&amp;C Act are concerned, such\n       powers can be exercised by the Tribunal constituted under the <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_35\">Gujarat\n       Act</a> because there is no inconsistency in these two Acts as far as the\n       grant of interim relief is concerned. This power is already vested in the\n       tribunal under the <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_36\">Gujarat Act</a> and <a href=\"/doc/195675120/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 17</a> of the A&amp;C Act\n       compliments these powers and therefore it cannot be said that the\n       provisions of <a href=\"/doc/195675120/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 17</a> of the A&amp;C Act are inconsistent with the\n       <a href=\"/doc/179323145/\" id=\"a_39\">Gujarat Act</a>.&quot;</p><pre id=\"pre_2\">\n\n\n14     According to Mr. Thakore, his client may be protected for a\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                    Page 8 of 11</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                           Downloaded on : Wed Jan 12 04:04:52 IST 2022</span>\n      C/SCA/17338/2021                                ORDER DATED: 24/11/2021\n\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_19\">limited period i.e. the period during which his client is able to file an\nappropriate reference before the Tribunal and seek an appropriate\ninterim relief.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">15     On the other hand, this writ application has been vehemently\nopposed by Mr. Dipak R. Dave, the learned counsel appearing for the\nCorporation. Mr. Dave would submit that this writ application, at this\npoint of time, more particularly, when the matter is at the stage of show\ncause notice, should not be entertained and may be rejected only on this\nshort ground. According to Mr. Dave, the Corporation has issued a show\ncause notice to the writ applicant with a view to give an opportunity to\nmake good its case, and by now, it was expected of the writ applicant to\nfile an appropriate reply. According to Mr. Dave, no reply has been filed\ntill this date. However, Mr. Dave, with his usual fairness, submitted that\nthe writ applicant may file an appropriate reply at the earliest so that\nsuch reply may be considered by the Corporation to enable it to take an\nappropriate decision whether to terminate the contract and revoke the\nBank Guarantee or not. According to Mr. Dave, the Agreement / Letter\nof Award itself provides for an arbitration in accordance with Clause 29.\nClause 29 reads thus:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">       &quot;29.

However, still, it is not late\nfor the writ applicant to file an appropriate reply. Although the time\nperiod to file reply expires tomorrow i.e. on 25 th November 2021, we\ngrant indulgence to the writ applicant to file its reply on or before 30 th\nNovember 2021. Once the reply comes on record, the Corporation shall\nlook into the same and take an appropriate decision in accordance with\nlaw. If the Corporation needs any clarification on any issue, it may call\nupon the writ applicant to appear in person through any authorized\nofficer.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_25\">20     The aforesaid arrangement shall not preclude the writ applicant to\ninvoke the provisions of the Act, 1992 and raise a reference before the\nTribunal. If any such reference is raised, the Tribunal shall look into the\nsame in accordance with law and take an appropriate decision\nexpeditiously. We make it clear that there shall not be any unnecessary\ndelay on the part of the Tribunal. The same will not be appreciated by\nthe Court.
