The pleaded case of the Petitioners is as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">        The Deponent of the affidavit filed in support of the writ petition is\nthe Director of the 1st petitioner-Company and also the Managing\nDirector of the 2nd Petitioner-Company and 2nd respondent-Company  \napproached him in writing with a request to entrust the construction of\nE-Books, E-Magazines etc., and an agreement was entered into in \nbetween him and 2nd respondent Company on 18.11.2003.  As per the   \nterms of the same, 2nd respondent shall provide Bank Guarantee equal to\n20% of the value of the work contract as Earnest Money Deposit for\nfaithful performance of the Contract.  The 2nd respondent provided the\nBank Guarantee for an amount of Rs.1.00 Crore only in pursuance of the\nagreement dated 11.8.2003 and a work order contract was entered into\non 9.9.2003, which stipulated the terms and conditions as to the nature\nand quantum of work, its execution, billing, mode of payment,\nconfidentiality etc.  The total value of the work, which the petitioners\nentrusted to the 2nd respondent was valued at Rs.12.00 lakh U.S.Dollars\n(6.00 crores approximately) with its validity upto August, 2004.  The 2nd\nrespondent shall turn out work equivalent to 1.00 U.S. Dollars per month\nin the given circumstances.  The 2nd respondent failed to fulfill the terms\nof the contract.  On account of the breach of terms, the 1st respondent\nauthorized the Deponent to invoke the Bank guarantee and consequently \nhe invoked Earnest Money Deposit and Performance Guarantee given by   \n2nd respondent in accordance with the conditions agreed together.\nL.C.No.7677 dated 22.9.2003 of Istrail Discount Bank in New York for\n1.00 lakh U.S.Dollars was opened by the petitioners.   The 2nd\nrespondent failed to execute the works as per the Agreement, as such\nthe Bank Guarantee given towards the EMD for faithful performance of\nthe Contract was rightly invoked.  After persuasion, the 1st respondent\npaid an amount of Rs.45,43,250/- only on 8.1.2004 and deliberately\nwithheld Rs.54,56,750/-.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.       The 2nd respondent instituted a suit, O.S.No.78 of 2004, before\nthe III Additional Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad on 17.7.2006\nfor a declaration that the payment of Rs.45,43,250/- made to the\npetitioners as illegal and void and for permanent injunction to restrain\nthe 1st respondent  from paying the balance of Rs.54,56,750/- in respect\nof the Bank Guarantee No.2657 BG:  130 2003 dated 8.9.2003 and for \nrefund of the amount of Rs.45,43,250/-, already paid to 4th respondent.\nThe said suit was partly decreed, declaring the payment made in favour\nof 4th respondent as illegal with a direction to the 2nd respondent to\nrefund the amount and as against the said decree, an appeal in\nC.C.C.A.No.212 of 2006 has been preferred before this Court and the\nsame is pending. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">4.      Contending that since the relief of injunction to restrain the\npayment of balance amount to the petitioners was rejected and as there\nis no injunction against the Bank from making the balance amount, the\nwithholding of the balance is arbitrary, discriminatory and violative of\n<a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_2\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1142233/\" id=\"a_3\">, 19(1)</a> <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_4\">&amp; (2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_5\">300-A</a> of the Constitution of India, the\npresent writ petition came to be filed.  This Court issued rule-nisi on\n30.10.2006.  Counter affidavits have been filed, denying the averments\nmade in the writ affidavit and in the direction of justifying the impugned\naction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">5.      Submissions/contentions of learned counsel for petitioners,\nSri M.V.Suresh \n\n5.1.    The impugned action of the 2nd respondent in not paying the\nbalance amount of Rs.54,56,750/- is neither sustainable nor tenable in\nthe eye of law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">5.2     In the absence of any order of injunction, the 1st respondent is not\njustified in refusing to pay the balance of the amount and the said action\nis violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_6\">Articles 14</a><a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_7\">, 19</a> and <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_8\">300A</a> of the constitution of India.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">5.3     In O.S.No.78 of 2004, the 2nd respondent sought only the relief\nregarding the payment made by 1st respondent and did not seek the \nrelief regarding payment  of balance amount and the relief of injunction\nto restrain the payment of balance amount was rejected, as such the\nimpugned action is untenable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">5.4     The impugned action is contrary to the well established norms,\ncirculars, guidelines issued by the RBI/IBA from time to time with regard\nto the invocation of the Performance Guarantee and the law laid down by\nthe Apex Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">5.5     Without any authority of law and in an arbitrary and high handed\nmanner, instead of making full payment, the 1st respondent permitted\nthe petitioners to encash only part of the amount.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">5.6.    The  plea of the respondents with regard to non-maintainability is\nnot tenable as the very action of the 1st respondent transgresses the\nfundamental rights of the petitioners as enshrined under Chapter III of\nthe Constitution of India.      To bolster his submissions and contentions,\nthe learned counsel takes the support of the following judgments;\n(1)     M/s Mallikharjuna Chemicals, Piduguralla &amp; others v.\nThe Chief Marketing &amp; Movements, Singareni Collieries\nLtd., Hyderabad &amp; others\n(2)     Bank of India v.

In the light of the above pleadings, submissions and contentions,\nnow the issue which this Court is called upon to answer are;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">      Whether the present writ petition is maintainable under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India and whether the\npetitioners are entitled for any relief from this Court ?\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">8.      The material available before this Court manifestly reveals that the\n2nd respondent herein instituted O.S.No.78 of 2004 against the 1st\nrespondent and the petitioners herein on the file of the Court of the III\nAdditional Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad, seeking the following\nreliefs:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">       (1) To  declare that the action of the defendant No.1 in\npaying Rs.45,43,250/- to defendants 2 and 3 on the basis of\ninvocation of Bank Guarantee No.2657 BG 1302003 dated 8.9.2003   \nas illegal and void\n       (2) To issue permanent injunction against defendant No.1\nfrom paying the balance amount of Rs.54,56,750/- to defendants 2\nand 3 in respect of Bank Guarantee No.2657 BG 1302003 dated   \n8.9.2003 and to direct the defendants 1 to 3 jointly and severally to\nrefund Rs.45,43,250/- to the plaintiff together with interest from the\ndate of suit till the payment of realization and also for costs of suit.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">9.      In the said suit,  the Court framed the following Issues for\ntrial:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">(1)    Whether the plaintiff is entitled that the action on the 1st\ndefendant is paying Rs.45,43,250/- to the 2nd and 3rd defendant on\nthe basis of invocation of bank guarantee No.2657 BG 1302003 \ndated 8.9.2003 as illegal and void?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">(2)     Whether the plaintiff is entitled to permanent injunction\nagainst the 1st defendant from paying balance amount of\nRs.54,56,750/- to D2 and D3 in respect of bank guarantee No.2657\nBG 1302003 dated 8.9.2003?  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">(3)     Whether the plaintiff is entitled to a direction to D1 and D3\njointly and severally to refund Rs.45,43,250/- to the plaintiff\ntogether with interest from the date of suit till the payment on\nrealization?\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">(4)     To what relief?\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">10.     The learned Chief Judge, City Civil Court, Hyderabad on 17.7.2006\npassed the following decree:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">(1)    That the suit of the plaintiff be and the same is hereby\ndecree as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">That the payment of Rs.45,43,250/- made by the 1st defendant to\n2nd defendant, 3rd defendant is declared as illegal and\n(2)     That the 1st defendant, 2nd defendant and 3rd defendant\nshall pay Rs.45,43,250/- to the plaintiff with interest at 7.5% p.a.\nfrom 8.1.2004 till the date of realization jointly and several and\n(3)     That the relief of permanent injunction against the 1st\ndefendant paying Rs.54,56,750 to 2nd and 3rd defendant is\ndismissed, and \n(4)     This Court further orders and directed that the 1st, 2nd and\n3rd defendants shall pay Rs.2,89,101/- to the plaintiff towards costs\nof this suit and bearing their own costs.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">11.     While dealing with Issue Nos.1 &amp; 2 the learned Chief Judge, in\nO.S.No.78 of 2004, held as follows :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">       Here, in the case of hand, the 1st defendant is aware of the\nfact that unless it receives a letter in writing invoking the bank\nguarantees payment cannot be made, yet it proceeded to pay the \namount of Rs.45,43,250/- and despite the fact it being a\nGovernment of India enterprise, replaced Ex.B2 and B3 evidently\nwith antidate to cover up its lapses.  So, it is a clear case of fraud\nnot only played by the beneficiary but is perpetuated by the bank in\nutter violation of condition No.2 of Ex.A1.  Therefore, the bank,\nwhich had issued the bank guarantee on deposit of equal amount by \nthe plaintiff and also charged the plaintiff with some commission,\nplaced itself in the place of a trustee for the money of plaintiff had\nviolated its duty and therefore, from the date of payment wrongfully\nto defendant 2 and 3 it is liable to repay the said amount of\nRs.45,43,250/- with interest to plaintiff.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">12.     While dealing with Issue No.3, the learned Chief Judge held as\nunder:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">        Admittedly, the second LC for a sum of Rs.54,56,750/- was\nestablished by Barclays Bank, PLC, London opened on behalf of M/s \nWarrenby Limited U.K. for 117000 US dollars on 30.9.2003.  As per\nthe evidence of both DW1 and DW2 the 1st defendant refused to \naccept the invocation of that part of bank guarantee because\nWarrenby Limited did not sign the letter of invocation.  There may\nbe a sub contract between the 2nd defendant and Warrenby Limited. \nWhen the bank is refusing the payment and in the absence of\nWarrenby Limited as the party to the suit, permanent injunction\ncannot be granted restrain in the 1st defendant bank accepting the\ninvocation of bank guarantee for Rs.54,56,750/- because even\naccording to the 1st defendant it is not going to make payment to\nthe 2nd defendant and 3rd defendant, more interestingly, the time of\nbank guarantee is admittedly expired by 30.9.2004.  Therefore, this\nrelief of permanent injunction is so far as the bank guarantee for\nRs.54,56,750/- with reference to LC for US dollars 117000 opened\non behalf of M/s Warren by Limited, U.K. became infractuous.  This\nissue is answered against the plaintiff though not adverse to him in\neffect.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_22\">13.     A perusal of the finding on Issue No.3, as extracted, cannot be\nconstrued as a finding adverse to the plaintiff nor it can be construed or\nunderstood as a finding in favour of the defendants/petitioners herein.\nThe learned Chief Judge recorded the said finding, taking into\nconsideration the factum of refusal of payment of balance amount by the\n1st respondent Bank.  Significant to note is that the defendants 2 and 3,\nwho are the petitioners herein preferred C.C.C.A.No.212 of 2006 against\nthe said decree and this Court on 9.10.2006 in C.C.C.A.M.P.No.574 of\n2006 passed the following order:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">Heard both sides.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">There shall be interim stay on condition of the petitioners-appellants\ndepositing half of the decretal amount along with the suit cost\nwithin a period of four weeks from today.  On such deposit, the\nrespondents are permitted to withdraw half of the deposited\ndecretal amount without furnishing any security and another half by\nfurnishing security.  However, the respondents are permitted to\nwithdraw the suit costs without furnishing any security.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">14.     The said Appeal is pending consideration before this Court and\nwhile the situation being so, the petitioners herein filed the present writ\npetition on 26.10.2006, seeking a direction for payment of the balance\namount.  It is an admitted fact that the very payment of Rs.45,43,250/-\nwas found erroneous and faulty by the learned Chief Judge in O.S.No.78\nof 2004, as such there is absolutely no justification on the part of the\npetitioners in asking for the balance amount pending the Appeal Suit\nbefore this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">15.     Coming to the Judgments cited by the Counsel for the Petitioners.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">(1)     In M/s Mallikharjuna Chemicals, Piduguralla v. The Chief Marketing\n&amp; Movements, Singareni Collieries Ltd., Hyderabad (1 supra), this Court\nat paragraph 29, held as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">        From a resume of the above discussion, the following principles\nwould emerge: (1) The State, its instrumentalities, Corporations or\nagencies are free to enter into contracts with the citizens or legal\npersons.  Before entry into the contract at the threshold the\nconstitutional requirement of giving fair treatment to the citizen or\npersons is mandatory. (2) On entering into the contract-qua the\ncontract, the State, its instrumentalities, Corporations or agencies\nwhile acting in public interest should see that they act on the basis\nof the terms and conditions of the covenants of the contract.  It is\nnot free like a private citizen to terminate contract arbitrarily or\nunreasonably or capriciously. (3) The State, its instrumentalities or\nagencies statutory Corporations or other authorities must have\npublic duty to perform in its dealings with the citizen or the person\nwith whom it entered into contractual relations.  The distinction\nbetween public law remedy and private law field has become\ngradually thin.  The arms of the Court are long enough to reach\ninjustice wherever it is found. (4) The actions of the State, its\ninstrumentalities, Corporations, agencies or authorities must be\nsupported by reasons. (5) Each case must be considered on its own \nfacts and find whether the impugned action is in the public interest.\n(6) If complicated questions of fact, which are the foundation for\ngrant of relief, are involved for adjudication, the Court would refuse\nto grant the relief and relegate the party to civil suit.  Alternative\nremedy is not always a test for the obvious reason that the remedy\nfor a civil injury is always available in a civil court.  But if the facts\nare undisputed and the disputation is one of law, the Court would\nmake a declaration of law on the admitted facts.  A citizen or the\nperson need not be denied of the efficacious or expeditious\nadjudication and remedy by the Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_18\">Article 226.</a> (7) The\naction of the State, its instrumentalities, statutory corporation or\nagencies must not be arbitrary or unreasonable, whimsical or\ncapricious.   The order must be based on reasons.  Reasons need \nnot necessarily be communicated if so chosen, but normally may be \ncommunicated.  But however, the record must disclose the reasons \non the basis of which the action was taken. (8) No notice before\ntermination of contract need be issued and principles of natural\njustice need not be observed.  But fair play must be observed. (9) A\nhost of other considerations relevant and germane may enter in a\ngiven case calling for examination.  In the light of these principles,\nin an appropriate case, a writ petition even in relation to contractual\narena would lie and the Court would examine each case on its own\nfacts.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1748945\" id=\"span_8\">(2)     In <a href=\"/doc/1748945/\" id=\"a_19\">Bank of India v. Nangia Construction (India) Pvt.Ltd.</a>, (2 supra),\nthe Honble Apex Court, at paragraph 14, held as under:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">         It is unfortunate that a nationalized bank is finding excuses\nfor refusing to make the payment on totally untenable and frivolous\ngrounds. The Division Bench was fully justified in making\nobservations regarding the conduct of the nationalized bank. The\nentire trust, faith and confidence of people depend on the conduct\nand credibility of the nationalized bank. In the present day world,\nthe national and international commercial transactions largely\ndepend on bank guarantees. In case the banks are permitted to\ndishonour their commitments by adopting such subterfuges, the\nentire commercial and business transactions will come to a grinding\nhalt.

The words &quot;as far as it can be made applicable&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1141333\" id=\"span_10\">make it clear that, in applying the various provisions of the Code\nto proceedings other than those of a suit, the court must take into\naccount the nature of those proceedings and the relief sought. The\nobject of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_23\">Article 226</a> is to provide a quick and inexpensive remedy\nto aggrieved parties. Power has consequently been vested in, the\nHigh Courts to issue to any person or authority, including in\nappropriate cases any government, within the jurisdiction of the\nHigh Court, orders or writs, including writs in the nature of habeas\ncorpus, mandamus, prohibition, quo warranto and certiorari. It is\nplain that if the procedure of a suit had also to be adhered to in\nthe case of writ petitions, the entire purpose of having a quick and\ninexpensive remedy would be defeated. A writ petition under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 226</a>, it needs to be emphasised, is essentially different from\na suit and it would be incorrect to assimilate and incorporate the\nprocedure of a suit into the proceedings of a petition under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_25\">Article 226.</a> The High Court is not deprived of its jurisdiction to\nentertain a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 226</a> merely because in\nconsidering the petitioner&#x27;s right of relief, questions of fact may fall\nto be determined. In a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_27\">Article 226</a> the High Court\nhas jurisdiction to try issues both of fact and law. Exercise of the\njurisdiction is no doubt discretionary, but the discretion must be\nexercised on sound judicial principles. When the petition raises\ncomplex questions of fact, which may for their determination\nrequire oral evidence to be taken, and on that account the High\nCourt is of the view that the dispute should not appropriately be\ntried in a writ petition, the High Court may decline to try a petition\n(see <a href=\"/doc/1141333/\" id=\"a_28\">Gunwant Kaur v. Bhatinda Municipality</a> : AIR1970SC802 . If,\nhowever, on consideration of the nature of the controversy, the\nHigh Court decides, as in the present case, that it should go into a\ndisputed question of fact and the discretion exercised by the High\nCourt appears to be sound and in conformity with judicial\nprinciples, this Court would not interfere in appeal with the order\nmade by the High Court in this respect.</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_11\">(4)     In <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_29\">ABL International Ltd. v.

The next question is whether the appellant can complain of\nthis by way of a writ. In our opinion, he could have done so in an\nordinary case.

A\nwrit would therefore be ineffective and as it is not our practice to\nissue meaningless writs we must dismiss this appeal and leave the\nappellant content with an enunciation of the law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"485924\" id=\"span_13\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"838233\" id=\"span_14\">10. It is clear from the above observations of this Court in the\nsaid case, though a writ was not issued on the facts of that case,\nthis Court has held that on a given set of facts if a State acts in an\narbitrary manner even in a matter of contract, an aggrieved party\ncan approach the court by way of writ under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution and the court depending on facts of the said  case is\nempowered to grant the relief. This judgment in <a href=\"/doc/838233/\" id=\"a_33\">K.N. Guruswamy v.\nState of Mysore1</a> was followed subsequently by this Court in the\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/485924/\" id=\"a_34\">D.F.O. v. Ram Sanehi Singh2</a> wherein this Court held: (SCC\np. 865, para 4)\n   By that order he has deprived the respondent of a valuable\nright. We are unable to hold that merely because the source of the\nright which the respondent claims was initially in a contract, for\nobtaining relief against any arbitrary and unlawful action on the part\nof a public authority he must resort to a suit and not to a petition by\nway of a writ. In view of the judgment of this Court in K.N.\nGuruswamy case1 there can be no doubt that the petition was \nmaintainable, even if the right to relief arose out of an alleged\nbreach of contract, where the action challenged was of a public\nauthority invested with statutory power.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_30\">   (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">   16. A perusal of this judgment though shows that a writ petition\ninvolving serious disputed questions of facts which requires\nconsideration of evidence which is not on record, will not normally\nbe entertained by a court in the exercise of its jurisdiction under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. This decision again, in our\nopinion, does not lay down an absolute rule that in all cases\ninvolving disputed questions of fact the parties should be relegated\nto a civil suit. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1141333\" id=\"span_15\">In this view of ours, we are supported by a judgment\nof this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1141333/\" id=\"a_36\">Gunwant Kaur v. Municipal Committee,\nBhatinda8</a> where dealing with such a situation of disputed questions\nof fact in a writ petition this Court held: (SCC p. 774, paras 14-16)</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">   14. The High Court observed that they will not determine\ndisputed question of fact in a writ petition. But what facts were in\ndispute and what were admitted could only be determined after an\naffidavit-in-reply was filed by the State. The High Court, however,\nproceeded to dismiss the petition in limine. The High Court is not\ndeprived of its jurisdiction to entertain a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 226</a>\nmerely because in considering the petitioners right to relief\nquestions of fact may fall to be determined. In a petition under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_38\">Article 226</a> the High Court has jurisdiction to try issues both of fact\nand law. Exercise of the jurisdiction is, it is true, discretionary, but\nthe discretion must be exercised on sound judicial principles. When\nthe petition raises questions of fact of a complex nature, which may\nfor their determination require oral evidence to be taken, and on\nthat account the High Court is of the view that the dispute may not\n appropriately be tried in a writ petition, the High Court may decline\nto try a petition. Rejection of a petition in limine will normally be\njustified, where the High Court is of the view that the petition is\nfrivolous or because of the nature of the claim made dispute sought\nto be agitated, or that the petition against the party against whom\nrelief is claimed is not maintainable or that the dispute raised\nthereby is such that it would be inappropriate to try it in the writ\njurisdiction, or for analogous reasons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">   15. From the averments made in the petition filed by the\nappellants it is clear that in proof of a large number of allegations\nthe appellants relied upon documentary evidence and the only\nmatter in respect of which conflict of facts may possibly arise related\nto the due publication of the notification under <a href=\"/doc/176775526/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 4</a> by the\nCollector.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">   16. In the present case, in our judgment, the High Court was\nnot justified in dismissing the petition on the ground that it will not\ndetermine disputed question of fact. The High Court has jurisdiction\nto determine questions of fact, even if they are in dispute and the\npresent, in our judgment, is a case in which in the interests of both\nthe parties the High Court should have entertained the petition and\ncalled for an affidavit-in-reply from the respondents, and should\nhave proceeded to try the petition instead of relegating the\nappellants to a separate suit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"613566\" id=\"span_16\">17. The above judgment of Gunwant Kaur8 finds support from\nanother judgment of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/613566/\" id=\"a_40\">Century Spg. and Mfg.\nCo. Ltd. v. Ulhasnagar Municipal Council9</a> wherein this Court held:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">(SCC p. 587, para 13)\n   Merely because a question of fact is raised, the High Court will\nnot be justified in requiring the party to seek relief by the somewhat\nlengthy, dilatory and expensive process by a civil suit against a\npublic body. The questions of fact raised by the petition in this case\nare elementary.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">   19. Therefore, it is clear from the above enunciation of law that\nmerely because one of the parties to the litigation raises a dispute in\nregard to the facts of the case, the court entertaining such petition\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_41\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is not always bound to relegate\nthe parties to a suit. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"613566\" id=\"span_17\">In <a href=\"/doc/613566/\" id=\"a_42\">the above case</a> of Gunwant Kaur8 this Court\neven went to the extent of holding that in a writ petition, if the facts\nrequire, even oral evidence can be taken. This clearly shows that in\nan appropriate case, the writ court has the jurisdiction to entertain a\nwrit petition involving disputed questions of fact and there is no\n absolute bar for entertaining a writ petition even if the same arises\nout of a contractual obligation and/or involves some disputed\nquestions of fact.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">   23. It is clear from the above observations of this Court, once\nthe State or an instrumentality of the State is a party of the\ncontract, it has an obligation in law to act fairly, justly and\nreasonably which is the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution\nof India. Therefore, if by the impugned repudiation of the claim of\nthe appellants the first respondent as an instrumentality of the State\nhas acted in contravention of the abovesaid requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_44\">Article\n14</a>, then we have no hesitation in holding that a writ court can issue\nsuitable directions to set right the arbitrary actions of the first\nrespondent. In this context, we may note that though the first\nrespondent is a company registered under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_45\">Companies Act</a>, it is\nwholly owned by the Government of India. The total subscribed\nshare capital of this Company is 2,50,000 shares out of which\n2,49,998 shares are held by the President of India while one share\neach is held by the Joint Secretary, Ministry of Commerce and\nIndustry and Officer on Special Duty, Ministry of Commerce and\nIndustry respectively. The objects enumerated in the memorandum \nof association of the first respondent at para 10 read:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">   To undertake such functions as may be entrusted to it by the\nGovernment from time to time, including grant of credits and\nguarantees in foreign currency for the purpose of facilitating the\nimport of raw materials and semi-finished goods for manufacture or\nprocessing goods for export.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">Para 11 of the said object reads thus:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">   To act as agent of the Government, or with the sanction of the\nGovernment on its own account, to give the guarantees, undertake\nsuch responsibilities and discharge such functions as are considered\nby the Government as necessary in national interest.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1703868\" id=\"span_18\">25. The learned counsel for the respondent then contended that\nthough the principal prayer in the writ petition is for quashing the\nletters of repudiation by the first respondent, in fact the writ petition\nis one for a money claim which cannot be granted in a writ\npetition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. In our\nopinion, this argument of the learned  counsel also cannot be\naccepted in its absolute terms. This Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1703868/\" id=\"a_47\">U.P.\nPollution Control Board v. Kanoria Industrial Ltd.13</a> while dealing\nwith the question of refund of money in a writ petition after\ndiscussing the earlier case-law on this subject held: (SCC pp. 556-\n58, paras 12 &amp; 16-17)</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">   12. In the para extracted above, in a similar situation as arising\nin the present cases relating to the very question of refund, while\nanswering the said question affirmatively, this Court pointed out\nthat the courts have made distinction between those cases where a\nclaimant approached a High Court seeking relief of obtaining refund\nonly and those where refund was sought as a consequential relief\nafter striking down of the order of assessment etc. In these cases\nalso the claims made for refund in the writ petitions were\nconsequent upon declaration of law made by this Court. Hence, the\nHigh Court committed no error in entertaining the writ petitions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">   16. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1561861\" id=\"span_19\">In support of the submission that a writ petition seeking\nmandamus for mere refund of money was not maintainable, the  \ndecision in <a href=\"/doc/1561861/\" id=\"a_48\">Suganmal v. State of M.P.14</a> was cited. In AIR para 6 of\n<a href=\"/doc/1561861/\" id=\"a_49\">the said judgment</a>, it is stated that\nwe are of the opinion that though the High Courts have power to\npass any appropriate order in the exercise of the powers conferred\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, such a petition solely praying\nfor the issue of a writ of mandamus directing the State to refund the\nmoney is not ordinarily maintainable for the simple reason that a\nclaim for such a refund can always be made in a suit against the\nauthority which had illegally collected the money as a tax.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">   17. Again in AIR para 9, the Court held:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">   We, therefore, hold that normally petitions solely praying for the\nrefund of money against the State by a writ of mandamus are not to\nbe entertained. The aggrieved party has the right of going to the\ncivil court for claiming the amount and it is open to the State to\nraise all possible defences to the claim, defences which cannot, in\nmost cases, be appropriately raised and considered in the exercise\nof writ jurisdiction.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">This judgment cannot be read as laying down the law that no writ\npetition at all can be entertained where claim is made for only\nrefund of money consequent upon declaration of law that levy and\ncollection of tax/cess is unconstitutional or without the authority of\nlaw. It is one thing to say that the High Court has no power under\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_51\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to issue a writ of mandamus for\nmaking refund of the money illegally collected. It is yet another\nthing to say that such power can be exercised sparingly depending\non facts and circumstances of each  case. For instance, in the cases\non hand where facts are not in dispute, collection of money as cess\nwas itself without the authority of law; no case of undue enrichment\nwas made out and the amount of cess was paid under protest; the \nwrit petitions were filed within a reasonable time from the date of\nthe declaration that the law under which tax/cess was collected was\nunconstitutional. There is no good reason to deny a relief of refund\nto the citizens in such cases on the principles of public interest and\nequity in the light of the cases cited above. However, it must not be\nunderstood that in all cases where collection of cess, levy or tax is\nheld to be unconstitutional or invalid, the refund should necessarily\nfollow. We wish to add that even in cases where collection of cess,\nlevy or tax is held to be unconstitutional or invalid, refund is not an\nautomatic consequence but may be refused on several grounds  \ndepending on facts and circumstances of a given case.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">   26. Therefore, this objection must also fail because in a given\ncase it is open to the writ court to give such monetary relief also.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">   27. From the above discussion of ours, the following legal\nprinciples emerge as to the maintainability of a writ petition:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">   (a) In an appropriate case, a writ petition as against a State or\nan instrumentality of a State arising out of a contractual obligation is\nmaintainable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">   (b) Merely because some disputed questions of fact arise for\nconsideration, same cannot be a ground to refuse to entertain a writ\npetition in all cases as a matter of rule.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">   (c) A writ petition involving a consequential relief of monetary\nclaim is also maintainable.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"172383107\" id=\"span_20\">28. However, while entertaining an objection as to the\nmaintainability of a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution\nof India, the court should bear in mind the fact that the power to\nissue prerogative writs under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is\nplenary in nature and is not limited by any other provisions of the\nConstitution. The High Court having regard to the facts of the case,\nhas a discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition. The\nCourt has imposed upon itself certain restrictions in the exercise of\nthis power. (See <a href=\"/doc/172383107/\" id=\"a_54\">Whirlpool Corpn. v. Registrar of Trade Marks15</a>.)\nAnd this plenary right of the High Court to issue a prerogative writ\nwill not normally be exercised by the Court to the exclusion of other\navailable remedies unless such action of the State or its\ninstrumentality is arbitrary and unreasonable so as to violate the\nconstitutional mandate of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_55\">Article 14</a> or for other valid and legitimate\nreasons, for which the Court thinks it necessary to exercise the said\njurisdiction.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">   53. From the above, it is clear that when an instrumentality of\nthe State acts contrary to public good and public interest, unfairly,\nunjustly and unreasonably, in its contractual, constitutional or\nstatutory obligations, it really acts contrary to the constitutional\nguarantee found in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_56\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. Thus if we apply\nthe above principle of applicability of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_57\">Article 14</a> to the facts of this\ncase, then we notice that the first respondent being an\ninstrumentality of the State and a monopoly body had to be\napproached by the appellants by compulsion to cover its export risk.\nThe policy of insurance covering the risk of the appellants was\nissued by the first respondent after seeking all required information\nand after receiving huge sums of money as premium exceeding Rs  \n16 lakhs. On facts we have found that the terms of the policy do not\ngive room to any ambiguity as to the risk covered by the first\nrespondent. We are also of the considered opinion that the liability\nof the first respondent under the policy arose when the default of\nthe exporter occurred and thereafter when the Kazakhstan\nGovernment failed to fulfil its guarantee. There is no allegation that\nthe contracts in question were obtained either by fraud or by\nmisrepresentation. In such factual situation, we are of the opinion,\nthe facts of this case do not and should not inhibit the High Court or\nthis Court from granting the relief sought for by the petitioner.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">(5)     In Hyderabad Urban Development Authority, reconstituted as\nHyderabad Metropolitan Development Authority, Secunderabad v. M/s  \nIBC Knowledge Park Pvt. Ltd., rep. by its Managing Director Yunus Zia (5\nsupra), the Division Bench of this Court at paragraphs 48, 50 and 53,\nheld as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">48. On an analysis of the above decisions of the Supreme Court, it is\nclear that contractual obligations may fall under judicial review if\nthere is some public law element involved therein. Where the\ndispute lies within the contractual field pure and simple in the realm\nof private law a writ petition is not maintainable. In such cases, the\nrelations between the parties are governed by the contract which\ndetermines the rights and obligations of the parties Inter se.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">However, where there is an element of arbitrariness or\nunreasonableness, illegality, irrationality or procedural impropriety in\nthe action of state authorities offending <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_58\">Article 14</a> of the\nConstitution of India, even in respect of a dispute arising out of a\nprivate contract, the Court, in exercise of its power of judicial review\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_59\">Article 226</a>, can entertain the matter and grant relief as per\nlaw.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">Thus, though judicial review in matters of contractual obligations is\npermissible, but such review must be within the permissible limits\nand in public interest and in accordance with the principles laid\ndown by the Supreme Court. It must be intended to prevent\narbitrariness or favoritism and it must be exercised in the larger\npublic interest. It depends upon the facts and circumstances of each\ncase. In cases where there is an element of arbitrariness, illegality\nor irrationality in the action of the State or its instrumentality the\nCourt can interfere and grant relief. Here we are concerned with the\ncontractual obligations of the parties pure and simple and violation\nof the same by the parties. Therefore, the Tata Cellular case relied\nupon by the learned single Judge has no application as the said case\ndeals with award of contract. In Bareilly Development Authority\ncase, the Supreme Court categorically held when the State or its\ninstrumentality enters into ordinary contract with private persons,\nparties are governed by terms of the contract and aggrieved party is\nnot entitled to seek redress under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_60\">Article 226</a> for breach of the\ncontract. In State of Gujarat and Others v. Meghji Pethraj Shah\nCharitable Trust and Others: (1994) 3 SCC 552 supra) also it was\nheld if the matter is governed by a contract or agreement between\nthe parties, writ petition is not maintainable since it is a public law\nremedy and is not available for any private law filed. Since the\nparties herein are governed by the terms of the contract pure and\nsimple the aggrieved party has to seek the relief in appropriate\nforum but not by way of judicial review under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution of India.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_21\">50. It is true that an action of state instrumentality even in\ncontractual matters of private nature is amenable to writ jurisdiction\nif it acts unfairly, unjustly and unreasonably as held by the Supreme\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_62\">ABL International Ltd.</a> case and Tata Cellular case. In the\ninstant case there is no material to show that the state authorities\nhad acted unfairly, unjustly or unreasonably. The only contention is\nthat it had not disclosed about the dispute as to the title of the State\nto the property. As already stated, according to the state\ninstrumentality it has unimpeachable title to the property; therefore,\nquestion of non-disclosure of any material defect does not arise.\nEven after the expiry of the time limit, the respondents had enlarged\ntime for payment of balance sale consideration on two occasions but\nthe petitioners have not availed of it and even when the\nrespondents have agreed to refund the amounts paid, the\npetitioners have not chosen to furnish the bank guarantee as\nrequested. Clause (b) of Confirmation-cum-provisional allotment of\nterms of and conditions of agreement provide that final allotment\nletter will be issued on payment of full sale price. Clause (c) of Initial\nDeposit provides that in case of cancellation of allotment for non-\npayment of balance sale price as stipulated or for any other reason,\nthe entire ID amount in full stands forfeited. Clause (e) provides\nthat any part payments made towards ID and failed pay the balance\nsale price within the prescribed time, both EMD and whatever\namount of ID paid is liable for forfeiture. As already stated, the\ncontract between the parties is a concluded one. Therefore, the\npetitioners having failed to fulfil the conditions of the contract\ncannot complain arbitrariness or illegality in the action of the\nrespondents declining to refund the amounts paid and claim refund\nin a writ proceeding.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"332927\" id=\"span_22\">53. <a href=\"/doc/332927/\" id=\"a_63\">Karnataka State Forest Industries Corpn. v.

There arose a dispute as to the quantum of the\nbalance amount payable by the respondent tenders. Though the \nGovernment suggested to the Corporation for refund of the excess\namounts paid, the amounts were not paid to the respondents. On \nchallenge before the Karnataka High Court, a learned single Judge\ndirected refund of the amount which was upheld by the Division\nBench. It was contended before the Supreme Court that the High\nCourt could not have exercised its jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_64\">Article 226</a> to\nenforce a contract qua contract, particularly when the same involved\ndisputed questions of fact and the respondents being bound by the\nterms and conditions of tender could not have been given any relief\nin derogation thereof. Upholding the decision of the High Court, the\nSupreme Court held that although the writ court would not enforce\nthe terms of a contract qua contract, but where an action of State is\narbitrary or discriminatory and violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_65\">Article 14</a>, a writ petition\nwould be nonetheless be maintainable. It was also held that a writ\nof mandamus can be issued only when there exist a legal right in\nthe writ petition and corresponding legal duty on the part of the\nState, but then if any action on the part of the State is wholly unfair\nor arbitrary; the superior courts are not powerless. In our view, the\nfacts of this case are distinguishable and have no application to the\ncase on hand. Here non-fulfillment of the terms and conditions of\nthe contract was on the part of the petitioners and not on the part\nof the respondents.  There is no dispute that the State and all its\ninstrumentalities have to conform to <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_66\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of\nwhich non-arbitrariness is a significant facet. As already held there is\nno arbitrariness or illegality in the action of the respondents\ndeclining to refund the amounts. Respondents afforded fair\nopportunity to the petitioners to take steps in respect of the contract\nby extending time to deposit the amounts, but the petitioners did\nnot deposit the amounts. Therefore, the petitioners cannot complain\nviolation of the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_67\">Article 14.</a>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"854142\" id=\"span_23\">(6)     In <a href=\"/doc/854142/\" id=\"a_68\">Himadri Chemicals Industries Ltd. v.

The law relating to grant or refusal to grant injunction in\nthe matter of invocation of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit is\nnow well settled by a plethora of decisions not only of this Court but\nalso of the different High Courts in India. In U.P. State Sugar Corpn.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">v. Sumac International Ltd.1 this Court considered its various earlier\ndecisions. In this decision, the principle that has been laid down\nclearly on the enforcement of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit\nis that in respect of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit which is\nsought to be encashed by a beneficiary, the bank giving such a\nguarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any\ndispute raised by its customer. Accordingly this Court held that the\ncourts should be slow in granting an order of injunction to restrain\nthe realisation of such a bank  guarantee. It has also been held by\nthis Court in that decision that the existence of any dispute between\nthe parties to the contract is not a ground to restrain the\nenforcement of bank guarantees or letters of credit. However, this\nCourt made two exceptions for grant of an order of injunction to\nrestrain the enforcement of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">(i) fraud committed in the notice of the bank which would vitiate the\nvery foundation of guarantee; and (ii) injustice of the kind which\nwould make it impossible for the guarantor to reimburse himself.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_24\">11. Except under these circumstances, the courts should not\nreadily issue injunction to restrain the realisation of a bank\nguarantee or a letter of credit. So far as the first exception is\nconcerned i.e. of fraud, one has to satisfy the court that the fraud in\nconnection with the bank guarantee or letter of credit would vitiate\nthe very foundation of such a bank guarantee or letter of credit. So\nfar as the second exception is concerned, this Court has held in that\ndecision that it relates to cases where allowing encashment of an\nunconditional bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm or\ninjustice to one of the parties concerned. While dealing with the\ncase of fraud, this Court in <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_69\">U.P. Coop. Federation Ltd. v. Singh\nConsultants and Engineers (P) Ltd.2</a> held as follows: (SCC p. 197,\npara 53)\n   The fraud must be of an egregious nature such as to vitiate the\nentire underlying transaction.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">   (emphasis supplied)\nWhile coming to a conclusion as to what constitutes fraud, this\nCourt <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_70\">in <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_71\">the above case</a></a> quoted (at SCC p. 197, para 54) with\napproval the observations of Sir John Donaldson, M.R. in Bolivinter\nOil SA v. Chase Manhattan Bank3, All ER at p. 352g-h which is as\nfollows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">   The wholly exceptional case where an injunction may be\ngranted is where it is proved that the bank knows that any demand\nfor payment already made or which may thereafter be made will\nclearly be fraudulent. But the evidence must be clear, both as to the\nfact of fraud and as to the banks knowledge. It would certainly not\nnormally be sufficient that this rests on the uncorroborated\nstatement of the customer, for irreparable damage can be done to a\nbanks credit in the relatively brief time which must elapse between\nthe granting of such an injunction and an application by the bank to\nhave it discharged.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">   (emphasis supplied)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1746106\" id=\"span_25\">13.

In that case an exporter in USA entered into an agreement\nwith the Imperial Government of Iran and sought an order\nterminating its liability on stand by letters of credit issued by an\nAmerican bank in favour of an Iranian bank as part of the contract.\nThe relief was sought on account of the situation created after the\nIranian revolution when the American Government cancelled the\nexport licences in relation to Iran and the Iranian Government had\nforcibly taken 52 American citizens as hostages. The US Government \nhad blocked all Iranian assets under the jurisdiction of United States\nand had cancelled the export contract. The Court upheld the\ncontention of the exporter that any claim for damages against the\npurchaser if decreed by the American courts would not be\nexecutable in Iran under these circumstances and realisation of the\nbank guarantee/letters of credit would cause irreparable harm to the\nplaintiff. This contention was upheld. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1746106\" id=\"span_27\">To avail of this exception,\ntherefore, exceptional circumstances which make it impossible for\nthe guarantor to reimburse himself if he ultimately succeeds, will\nhave to be decisively established.

Secondly, there was good\nreason<a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_75\">, <a href=\"/doc/1746106/\" id=\"a_76\">in that case</a></a> for the Court to be prima facie satisfied that the\nguarantors i.e. the bank and its customer would be found entitled to\nreceive the amount paid under the guarantee.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">   (emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">   14. From the discussions made hereinabove relating to the\nprinciples for grant or refusal to grant of injunction to restrain\nenforcement of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit, we find that\nthe following principles should be noted in the matter of injunction\nto restrain the encashment of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">   (i) While dealing with an application for injunction in the course\nof commercial dealings, and when an unconditional bank guarantee \nor letter of credit is given or accepted, the beneficiary is entitled to\nrealise such a bank guarantee or a letter of credit in terms thereof\nirrespective of any pending disputes relating to the terms of the\ncontract.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">   (ii) The bank giving such guarantee is bound to honour it as per\nits terms irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">    (iii) The courts should be slow in granting an order of injunction\nto restrain the realisation of a bank guarantee or a letter of credit.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">   (iv) Since a bank guarantee or a letter of credit is an\nindependent and a separate contract and is absolute in nature, the\nexistence of any dispute between the parties to the contract is not a\nground for issuing an order of injunction to restrain enforcement of\nbank guarantees or letters of credit.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">   (v) Fraud of an egregious nature which would vitiate the very\nfoundation of such a bank guarantee or letter of credit and the\nbeneficiary seeks to take advantage of the situation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">   (vi) Allowing encashment of an unconditional bank guarantee or\na letter of credit would result in irretrievable harm or injustice to one\nof the parties concerned.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\">   15. Keeping these principles in mind and applying the same on\nthe facts of this case, we can only draw this conclusion that no good\nground has been made out by the appellant to interfere with the\nimpugned order. As noted hereinabove, there are two exceptions\nwhen courts can grant an order of injunction in favour of an\naggrieved party in the matter of encashment of a bank guarantee or\na letter of credit. Conditions (v) and (vi), as noted hereinabove, are\ntwo such exceptions. For this reason, let us first deal with the case\nof fraud pleaded by the appellant in their application for injunction.\nThe particulars of fraud have been pleaded in para 45 of the\napplication for injunction filed by the appellant in the High Court.\nFrom a close scrutiny of the facts pleaded in the said paragraph of\nthe application for injunction, in our view, it cannot be held that\nsuch facts have constituted fraud for which an order of injunction in\nthe matter of encashment of letter of credit could be passed by the\ncourts. The facts pleaded in para 45 of the application for injunction\nwould only show that although the respondent had agreed to\nremove the defects in the goods by saying that it shall take steps to\nreduce the ash content of the goods to 0.3% before the payment\ndate of the letter of credit as extended, but they deliberately and\nwith ulterior motive had not fulfilled their intention to do so. It is not\nin dispute that the particulars of the fraud prima facie were\nrestricted to 10,000 metric tons of the goods supplied by the\nrespondent in respect of which documents were not negotiated by\nthe appellant. The entire consignment which was admittedly shipped\nby MV Iran Takhti was 12,503 metric tons out of which 2503 metric\ntons were negotiated and payments released by Central Bank of \nIndia. Admittedly, as noted hereinabove, a case of fraud was alleged\nonly in respect of a part of the consignment of the second shipment.\nIt has been rightly held by the High Court that this could not\nconstitute fraud as fraud must be in respect of the whole\nconsignment and not in respect of a part of the same. In this view\nof the matter, we are, therefore, in agreement with the High Court\nthat the pleadings made relating to fraud in para 45 of the\napplication for injunction were not sufficient nor could any strong\nprima facie case of fraud be made out in the petition which would\nwarrant a continuance of the order of status quo. That apart, as\nnoted hereinearlier, in the matter of invocation of a bank  guarantee\nor a letter of credit, it is not open for the bank to rely upon the\nterms of the underlying contract between the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1388803\" id=\"span_28\">(7)     In <a href=\"/doc/1388803/\" id=\"a_77\">R.P.

The appellant, therefore, contends that when the\nsubsistence allowance is 75% of pay instead of adopting the 75% of\nthe average of 10 months pay i.e. average of Rs 2650 p.m. for 10\nmonths (or Rs 3300 as stated in the counter)  being the amount\nper month paid in the last 10 months before the compulsory\nretirement on 25-11-1992,  the respondents have wrongly \ncomputed the pension and all other retiral benefits illegally on the\nbasis of Rs 1250 p.m., the pay during the 10 months preceding the\norder of suspension dated 21-1-1982.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">   9. We shall now refer to the response of the respondents in\ntheir initial counter-affidavit filed before the Tribunal which, on its\nface, appears to be self-contradictory. It is stated there (p. 47 of the\npaper-book) that the Railway  Board in consultation with the\nDepartment of Pension and Pensioners Welfare have taken the view \nthat\nsince the petitioner was paid only subsistence allowance during the\nperiod of suspension, the relevant period of 10 months for\ncalculation of average emoluments for the pension should be the\none relating to 10 months period preceding 21-1-1982 i.e. the date\non which the petitioner had been kept under suspension.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">The above contention in the counter is obviously based on the order\ndated 28-5-1993 referred to earlier. It is then stated in the counter\nrather curiously that even if the average emoluments are fixed as\nper the pay revision w.e.f. 1-1-1986, the pension will not increase.\nThis peculiar logic in the counter is worth quoting:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">   It is pertinent to mention here that even though the pension\nwas calculated on the basis of pre-revised scale as on 1-1-1986, the\npension of the petitioner has been fixed at Rs 1178.00 which is\nequivalent to the revised pay scale as on 1-1-1986 plus normal relief\nas admissible from time to time to the pensioners. Therefore, it is\nimplied that the petitioner has been paid his due pension equivalent\nto the revised pay scale as admissible in such case. If his revised\npay of Rs 3200 were taken into consideration for the purpose of\ncalculation of pension, he would be getting the same pension i.e. Rs\n1178.00. Therefore, the prayer of the pensioner has got no merit\nand deserves to be dismissed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">(8)     In M/s Deluxe Wines, Kachiguda, Hyderabad v.

Barclays Bank International\nLtd (9 supra), it was held as under:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">        All this leads to the conclusion that the performance guarantee\nstands on a similar footing to a letter of credit.  A bank which gives\na performance guarantee must honour that guarantee according to \nits terms.  It is not concerned in the least with the relations between\nthe supplier and the customer; nor with the question whether the\nsupplier has performed his contracted obligation or not; nor with the\nquestion whether the supplier is in default or not.  The bank must\npay according to its guarantee, on demand if so stipulated, without\nproof or conditions. The only exception is when there is a clear\nfraud of which the bank has notice.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">   Such has been the course of decision in all the cases there have\nbeen this year in our courts here in England.  First of all, there was\nR D Harbottle (Mercantile) Ltd v. National Westminster Bank Ltd\n(1977) 2 All ER 862 at 870 before Kerr J.  The learned judge\nconsidered the position in principle.

They\nare the life-blood of international commerce.  Such obligations are\nregarded as collateral to the underlying rights and obligations\nbetween the merchants at either end of the banking chain.  Except\npossibly in clear cases of fraud of which the banks have notice, the\ncourts will leave the merchants to settle their disputes under the\ncontracts by litigation or arbitration as available to them or\nstipulated in the contracts.   The courts are not concerned with their\ndifficulties to enforce such claims; these are risks which the\nmerchants take.  In this case the plaintiffs took the risk of the\nunconditional wording of the guarantees. The machinery and\ncommitments of banks are on a different level.

He said:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">   Whether the obligation arises under a letter of credit or under a\nguarantee, the obligation of the bank is to perform by that particular\ncontract, and that obligation does not in the ordinary way depend\non the correct resolution of a dispute as to the sufficiency of\nperformance by the seller to the buyer or by the buyer to the seller\nas the case may be under the sale and purchase contract; the bank\nhere is simply concerned to see whether the event has happened on \nwhich its obligation to pay has arisen.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1834541\" id=\"span_29\">(10)    In <a href=\"/doc/1834541/\" id=\"a_78\">United Commercial Bank v.

It the light of these principles, the rule is well established that a\nbank issuing or confirming a letter of credit is not concerned with\nthe underlying contract between the buyer and seller.

In the instant case, the learned Judge has proceeded on\nthe basis that this was not an injunction sought against the bank but\nthis was the injunction sought against the appellant. But the net\neffect of the injunction is to restrain the bank from performing the\nbank guarantee. That cannot be done. One cannot do indirectly\nwhat one is not free to do directly. But a maltreated man in such\ncircumstances is not remedyless. The respondent was not to suffer\nany injustice which was irretrievable. The respondent can sue the\nappellant for damages. In this case, there cannot be any basis for\napprehension that irretrievable damages would be caused if any. I\nam of the opinion that this is not a case in which injunction should\nbe granted. An irrevocable commitment either in the form of\nconfirmed bank guarantee or irrevocable letter of credit cannot be\ninterfered with except in case of fraud or in case of question of\napprehension of irretrievable injustice has been made out. This is\nthe well settled principle of the law in England. This is also a well\nsettled principle of law in India, as I shall presently notice from\nsome of the decisions of the High Court and decisions of this Court.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">   28. I am, however, of the opinion that these observations must\nbe strictly considered in the light of the principle enunciated. It is\nnot the decision that there should be a prima facie case. In order to\nrestrain the operation either of irrevocable letter of credit or of\nconfirmed letter of credit or of bank guarantee, there should be\nserious dispute and there should be good prima facie case of fraud\nand special equities in the form of preventing irretrievable injustice\nbetween the parties. Otherwise the very purpose of bank\nguarantees would be negatived and the fabric of trading operation\nwill get jeopardised.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">   30. These observations a fortiori apply to a bank guarantee\nbecause upon bank guarantee revolves many of the internal trade\nand transactions in a country. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1834541\" id=\"span_32\">In <a href=\"/doc/1834541/\" id=\"a_81\">United Commercial Bank v. Bank of\nIndia12</a> this Court was dealing with injunction restraining the bank\nin respect of letter of credit. This Court observed that the High Court\nwas wrong in granting the temporary injunction restraining the\nappellant bank from recalling the amount paid to the respondent\nbank. The Court reiterated that courts usually refrain from granting\ninjunction to restrain the performance of the contractual obligations\narising out of a letter of credit, or a bank guarantee between one\nbank and another. If such temporary injunction were to be granted\nin a transaction between a banker and a banker, restraining a bank\nfrom recalling the amount due when payment was made under   \nreserve to another bank or in terms of the letter of guarantee or\ncredit executed by it, the whole banking system in the country\nwould fail.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">   34. On the basis of these principles I reiterate that\ncommitments of banks must be honoured free from interference by \nthe courts. Otherwise, trust in commerce internal and international\nwould be irreparably damaged. It is only in exceptional cases that is\nto say in case of fraud or in case of irretrievable injustice be done,\nthe court should interfere.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">   43. The argument for the respondent is attractive but it seems\nto overlook the basic nature of the case. The basic nature of the\ncase relates to the obligations assumed by the bank under the\nguarantees given to UPCOF Ltd. If under law, the bank cannot be\nprevented by SCE(P) Ltd. from honouring the credit guarantees, the\nUPCOF Ltd. also cannot be restrained from invoking the guarantees.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">What applies to the bank must equally apply to UPCOF Ltd. \nTherefore, the frame of the suit by not impleading the bank cannot\nmake any difference in the position of law. Equally, it would be futile\nto contend that the court was justified in granting the injunction\nsince it has found a prima facie case in favour of the SCE(P) Ltd.\nThe  question of examining the prima facie case or balance of\nconvenience does not arise if the court cannot interfere with the\nunconditional commitment made by the bank in the guarantees in \nquestion.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_56\">   53. Whether it is a traditional letter of credit or a new device\nlike performance bond or performance guarantee, the obligation of\nbanks appears to be the same. If the documentary credits are\nirrevocable and independent, the banks must pay when demand is  \nmade. Since the bank pledges its own credit involving its reputation,\nit has no defence except in the case of fraud. The banks obligations\nof course should not be extended to protect the unscrupulous seller,\nthat is, the seller who is responsible for the fraud. But, the banker\nmust be sure of his ground before declining to pay. The nature of\nthe fraud that the courts talk about is fraud of an egregious nature\nas to vitiate the entire underlying transaction. It is fraud of the\nbeneficiary, not the fraud of somebody else. If the bank detects with\na minimal investigation the fraudulent action of the seller, the\npayment could be refused. The bank cannot be compelled to honour \nthe credit in such cases. But it may be very difficult for the bank to\ntake a decision on the alleged fraudulent action. In such cases, it\nwould be proper for the bank to ask the buyer to approach the court\nfor an injunction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">   54. The court, however, should not lightly interfere with the\noperation of irrevocable documentary credit. I agree with my\nlearned brother that in order to restrain the operation of the\nirrevocable letter of credit, performance bond or guarantee, there\nshould be serious dispute to be tried and there should be a good\nprima facie acts of fraud. As Sir John Donaldson, M.R. said in\nBolivinter Oil SA v. Chase Manhattan Bank16:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">   The wholly exceptional case where an injunction may be\ngranted is where it is proved that the bank knows that any demand\nfor payment already made or which may thereafter be made will\nclearly be fraudulent. But the evidence must be clear, both as to the\nfact of fraud and as to the banks knowledge. It would certainly not\nnormally be sufficient that this rests on the uncorroborated\nstatement of the customer, for irreparable damage can be done to a\nbanks credit in the relatively brief time which must elapse between\nthe granting of such an injunction and an application by the bank to\nhave it discharged.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">   55. From the above discussion, what appears to me is this: The\nsound banking system may, however require more caution in the \nissuance of irrevocable documentary credits. It would be for the\nbanks to safeguard themselves by other means and generally not \nfor the court to come to their rescue with injunctions unless there is\nestablished fraud. In the result, this appeal must be allowed. The\n judgment and order of the Allahabad High Court dated 20-2-1987\nmust be set aside and the order of learned Civil Judge, Lucknow\ndated 8-8-1986 restored.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"143\" id=\"span_33\">(12)    In <a href=\"/doc/143/\" id=\"a_82\">Syndicate Bank v.

It is in common parlance that the issuance of guarantee is what\nthat a guarantor creates to discharge liability when the principal\ndebtor fails in his duty and guarantee is in the nature of collateral\nagreement to answer for the debt. It is well-settled that the Bank\nguarantee is an autonomous contract and imposes an absolute  \nobligation on the Bank to fulfill the terms and the payment in the\nBank guarantee becomes due on the happening of a contingency on   \nthe occurrence of which the guarantee becomes enforceable.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"573550\" id=\"span_34\">(13)    In <a href=\"/doc/573550/\" id=\"a_83\">The State Trading Corporation of India Ltd. v.

None of the conditions are satisfied or applicable to the facts in\nthis case. It is not the case that there is any fraud committed by the\nappellant in entering into contract with the respondent in particular\nwith reference to Clause 17 of the Contract dated April 20, 1985.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_61\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_35\">Nor is there any fraud into formation or execution of bank\nguarantee. From the contention of the appellant it would appear\nthat on account of negotiations between the appellant the principal\nforeign buyer-Abu Dhabi Municipality, the supply of 7000 M.T. of B-\nGrade basmati rice was not made in terms of the principal contract\nentered into by the appellant with the foreign buyer. But there is no\nclause in the contract dated April 20,1985 entered between the\nappellant and the respondents that the contract with the\nrespondents is co-terminus with non-performance or frustration of\nthe contract with the foreign buyer. In the absence of such recital\nthe necessary consequences is that irrespective&#x27; of the frustration of\nthe contract or cancellation of the contract between the principal\nsupplier, namely, the appellant and the foreign buyer, namely, Abu\nDhabi Municipality, the respondent was under the contract obligated\nto make supply of 3000 M.T. of B-Grade basmati rice in terms\nthereof. The certificate issued by the officer clearly shows that there\nwas a failure or default committed by the respondent in supplying\nthe rice as contracted for. Under those circumstances, it is not a\ncase of any fraud, but at best, it is a case of cancellation of the\ncontract by the appellant-principal supplier to the foreign buyer. But\nthat does not have the effect of frustrating or cancelling the contract\nwhich the respondent had entered into with the appellant.\nTherefore, even from the affidavit evidence given in support of the\napplication for injunction, not only no plea of fraud was made but\nalso there was no plea of irretrievable injustice that the respondent\nwas likely to suffer on account of the enforcement of the bank\nguarantee - an exception carved out by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_84\">U.P.\nCooperative Federation Ltd. v.

Therein this Court after elaborate\nconsideration of all the decisions, held in para 34 that on the basis\nof these principles the commitments of bank guarantee must be\nhonoured free from interference by the courts.

It is fraud of that\nbeneficiary and not the fraud of somebody else that would make the\nCourt to grant the Order of injunction as asked for. If the bank\ndetects with the minimal investigation the fraudulent action of the\nseller, the payment could be refused is not a fraud as contemplated\nunder the guarantee. We respectfully agree with the above ratio.\nThis view was reiterated in <a href=\"/doc/218672/\" id=\"a_85\">General Electric Technical Services Co.\nInc. v.

The law as to the contractual obligations\nunder the bank guarantee has been well settled in a catena of\ncases. Almost all such cases have been considered in <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_86\">U.P. Coop. \nFederation Ltd. v. Singh Consultants and Engineers (P) Ltd.\nFollowing</a> that ration it was observed that:</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">the Bank must honour the bank guarantee free from interference by\nthe courts. Otherwise, trust in commerce internal and international\nwould be irreparably damaged. It is only in exceptional cases that is\nto say in case of fraud or in case of irretrievable injustice, the court\nshould interfere. In the concurring opinion one of us (K. Jagannatha\nShetty, J.) has observed that whether it is a traditional bond or\nperformance guarantee, the obligation of the Bank appears to be\nthe same. If the documentary credits are irrevocable and\nindependent, the Bank must pay when demand is made. Since the   \nBank pledges its own credit involving its reputation, it has no\ndefence except in the case of fraud. The Bank&#x27;s obligations of\ncourse should not be extended to protect the unscrupulous party,\nthat is, the party who is responsible for the fraud. But the banker\nmust be sure of his ground before declining to pay. The nature of\nthe fraud that the courts talk about is fraud of an &quot;egregious nature\nas to vitiate the entire underlying transaction&quot;. It is fraud of the\nbeneficiary, not the fraud of somebody else.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">9. The grant of injunction is a discretionary power in equity\njurisdiction. The contract of guarantee is a trilateral contract which\nthe bank has undertaken to unconditionally and unequivocally abide\nby the terms of the contract. It is an act of trust with full faith to\nfacilitate free flow of trade and commerce in internal or international\ntrade or business. It creates an irrevocable obligation to perform the\ncontract in terms thereof. On the occurrence of the events\nmentioned therein the bank guarantee becomes enforceable. The \nsubsequent disputes in the performance of the contract does not\ngive rise to a cause nor is the court justified on that basis, to issue\nan injunction from enforcing the contract, i.e. bank guarantee. The\nparties are not left with no remedy. In the event of the dispute in\nthe main contract ends in the party&#x27;s favour, he/it is entitled to\ndamages or other consequential reliefs.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">10. It is settled law that the Court, before issuing the injunction\nunder Order 39, Rules 1 and 2, <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_87\">CPC</a> should prime face be satisfied\nthat there is triable issue strong prima facie case of fraud or\nirretrievable injury and balance of convenience is in favour of issuing\ninjunction to prevent irremediable injury. The court should normally\ninsist upon enforcement of the bank guarantee and the court should\nnot interfere with the enforcement of the contract of guarantee\nunless there is a specific plea of fraud or special equities in favour of\nthe plaintiff. He must necessarily plead and produce all the\nnecessary evidence in proof of the fraud in execution of the contract\nof the guarantee, but not the contract either of the original contract\nor any of the subsequent events that may happen as a ground for\nfraud.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">(14)    In U.P. State Sugar Corporation v. M/s Sumac International Ltd.\n(14 supra), the Honble Apex Court at paragraph 12, held as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">12. The law relating to invocation of such bank guarantees is by\nnow well settled. When in the course of commercial dealings an\nunconditional bank guarantee is given or accepted, the beneficiary is\nentitled to realize such a bank guarantee in terms thereof\nirrespective of any pending disputes. The bank giving such a\nguarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any\ndispute raised by its customer. The very purpose of giving such a\nbank guarantee would otherwise be defeated. The Courts should,\ntherefore, be slow in granting an injunction to restrain the\nrealization of such a bank guarantee. The Courts have carved out\nonly two exceptions. A fraud in connection with such a bank\nguarantee would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank\nguarantee. Hence if there is such a fraud of which the beneficiary\nseeks to take advantage, he can be restrained from doing so. The\nsecond exception relates to cases where allowing the encashment of\nan unconditional bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm\nor injustice to one of the parties concerned. Since in most cases\npayment of money under such a bank guarantee would adversely  \naffect the bank and its customer at whose instance the guarantee is\ngiven, the harm or injustice contemplated under this head must be\nof such an exceptional and irretrievable nature as would override\nthe terms of the guarantee and the adverse effect of such an\ninjunction on commercial dealings in the country. The two grounds\nare not necessarily connected, though both may co-exist in some\ncases. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_38\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_88\">U.P.

The bank must pay according to the tenor of its\nguarantee on demand without proof or condition. There are only\ntwo exceptions to this rule. The first exception is a case when there\nis a clear fraud of which the bank has notice. The fraud must be of\nan egregious nature such as to vitiate the entire underlying\ntransaction. Explaining the kind of fraud that may absolve a bank\nfrom honouring its guarantee, this Court in the above case quoted\nwith approval the observations of Sir John Donaldson, M.R. in\nBolivinter Oil SA v.

Nevertheless, this express\nterm merely reiterates the nature of a bank guarantee which is\npayable on demand being made by the beneficiary of the bank \nguarantee. A bank guarantee which is payable on demand implies \nthat the bank is liable to pay as and when a demand is made upon\nthe bank by the beneficiary. The Bank is not concerned with any\ninter se disputes between the beneficiary and the person at whose\ninstance the bank had issued the bank guarantee. All the three bank\nguarantees which have been invoked are  payable on demand. There  \nis, therefore, no merit in the submission that the bank guarantees\nhave not been properly invoked.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_91\">16.

A statute may expressly or impliedly confer power on a\nstatutory body to enter into contracts in order to enable it to\ndischarge its functions.

The fact that one of the parties to the\nagreement is a statutory or public body will not by itself affect the\nprinciples to be applied. The disputes about the meaning of a\ncovenant in a contract or its enforceability have to be determined\naccording to the usual principles of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_98\">Contract Act</a>. Every act of a\nstatutory body need not necessarily involve an exercise of statutory\npower. Statutory bodies, like private parties, have power to contract\nor deal with property. Such activities may not raise any issue of\npublic law. In the present case, it has not been shown how the\ncontract is statutory. The contract between the parties is in the\nrealm of private law. It is not a statutory contract.

That is a matter for adjudication by a\ncivil court or in arbitration if provided for in the contract.

The facts of the case concerned a cargo claim which\nLennards sought to defend by contending that <a href=\"/doc/681709/\" id=\"a_105\">Section 502</a> of the\nMerchant Shipping Act 2894 exonerated the owner from losses  \narising without his actual fault. The House of Lords held that they\ncould not rely on that defence since the fault of the appropriate\norgan such as the Board of Directors or managing Director could be\nattributed to the company.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_77\">In Farrar&#x27;s Company Law, 4th Edn. Page 147, it is stated:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">An employee who acts for the company in the course of his or her\nemployment will usually bind the company and his or her knowledge \nwill be attributed to the company because he or she is the company\nfor the purpose of the transaction in question.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">This is so even if the employee is acting dishonestly or against the\ninterests of the company or contrary to orders but it is not so where\nthe company is the victim. This is to avoid an obvious contradiction.\nAnother instance of the application of the theory of Corporate\nLiability is the `Attribution Approach&#x27; as adopted by the Judicial\nCommittee of the Privy Council in Meridian Global Funds\nManagement Asia Ltd. v. Securities Commission [1995] 2 AC 500 :  \n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">[1995] 3 All ER 918.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">In that case, two employees of Meridian, had improperly used their\nauthority to purchase in the name of the company a substantial\ninterest in Euro-National Corp. Ltd., a New Zealand listed company.\nUnder the New Zealand Securities Amendment Act 1988, Meridian   \nwas required to give notice of its acquisition to ENC and the Stock\nexchange. The two employees knew this but the Board and the  \nmanaging Director of Meridian did not. No notice was given. The\nPrivy Council upheld the New Zealand Court&#x27;s in decision holding\nthat Meridian had contravened the law, on the premise that the\nknowledge of the employee would be attributed to Meridian.\nWe will, thus, assume for the purpose of this case that the Banks\nare constructively liable for acts of their employees. We will also\nassume that the Banks are liable to pay the amount under the\ncontract for which the FDRs were issued.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"100123343\" id=\"span_44\">(4)     In <a href=\"/doc/100123343/\" id=\"a_106\">Rajasthan State Industrial Development and Investment\nCorporation v.

Kalathil14 this Court held that a\nwrit cannot lie to resolve a disputed question of fact, particularly to\ninterpret the disputed terms of a contract observing as under: (SCC\npp. 298-99, paras 10-11)\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">   10.  The interpretation and implementation of a clause in a\ncontract cannot be the subject-matter of a writ petition.  If a term\nof a contract is violated, ordinarily the remedy is not the writ\npetition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_110\">Article 226.</a> We are also unable to agree with the\nobservations of the High Court that the contractor was seeking\nenforcement of a statutory contract. .\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">   11.  The contract between the parties is in the realm of private\nlaw. It is not a statutory contract. The disputes relating to\ninterpretation of the terms and conditions of such a contract could\nnot have been agitated in a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 226</a> of the\nConstitution of India. That is a matter for adjudication by a civil\ncourt or in arbitration if provided for in the contract.  The\ncontractor should have relegated to other remedies.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_78\">   21. It is evident from the above that generally the Court should\nnot exercise its writ jurisdiction to enforce the contractual obligation.\nThe primary purpose of a writ of mandamus is to protect and\nestablish rights and to impose a corresponding imperative duty\nexisting in law. It is designed to promote justice (ex debito\njustitiae). The grant or refusal of the writ is at the discretion of the\ncourt. The writ cannot be granted unless it is established that there\nis an existing legal right of the applicant, or an existing duty of the\nrespondent. Thus, the writ does not lie to create or to establish a\nlegal right, but to enforce one that is already established. While\ndealing with a writ petition, the court must exercise discretion,\ntaking into consideration a wide variety of circumstances, inter alia,\nthe facts of the case, the exigency that warrants such exercise of\ndiscretion, the consequences of grant or refusal of the writ, and the\nnature and extent of injury that is likely to ensue by such grant or\nrefusal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">   22. Hence, discretion must be exercised by the court on\ngrounds of public policy, public interest and public good. The writ is\nequitable in nature and thus, its issuance is governed by equitable\nprinciples. Refusal of relief must be for reasons which would lead to\ninjustice. The prime consideration for the issuance of the said writ\nis, whether or not substantial justice will be promoted. Furthermore,\nwhile granting such a writ, the court must make every effort to\nensure from the averments of the writ petition, whether there  exist\nproper pleadings. In order to maintain the writ of mandamus, the\nfirst and foremost requirement is that the petition must not be\nfrivolous, and must be filed in good faith. Additionally, the applicant\nmust make a demand which is clear, plain and unambiguous. It \nmust be made to an officer having the requisite authority to perform\nthe act demanded. Furthermore, the authority against whom \nmandamus is issued, should have rejected the demand earlier.\nTherefore, a demand and its subsequent refusal, either by words, or\nby conduct, are necessary to satisfy the court that the opposite\nparty is determined to ignore the demand of the applicant with\nrespect to the enforcement of his legal right. However, a demand\nmay not be necessary when the same is manifest from the facts of\nthe case, that is, when it is an empty formality, or when it is obvious\nthat the opposite party would not consider the demand.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_80\">17.     The material placed before this Court categorically demonstrates\nthat the suit, O.S.No.78 of 2004 filed by the 2nd respondent against the\npetitioners and the 1st respondent-Bank was decreed on 17.7.2006 to the\nextent of payment already made by the 1st respondent-Bank and the \nlearned Chief judge was not inclined to go into the aspect of balance of\nthe amount in view of refusal by the 1st respondent Bank to pay the\nbalance amount.  The  learned Chief Judge also categorically observed in\nthe judgment that the same shall not be construed as finding against 2nd\nrespondent, as such the same does not tantamount to endorsing and  \nagreeing to the claim of the petitioners herein. The learned Chief Judge\nrecorded a categoric finding on the element of fraud in respect of the\ntransaction.  Admittedly appeal in C.C.C.A.No.212 of 2006 is pending\nbefore this Court, wherein this Court granted conditional interim order.\nTherefore the judgments cited by the learned counsel for the petitioners\nthat unless there is an element of fraud the Bank Guarantee cannot be\nwithheld is of no application to the case of the petitioners.  So long as\nthe said finding on the element of fraud stares at the petitioners, the\ncontentions based on the principles laid down in the said judgments are\nnot available to the petitioners.  Another justification offered by the 1st\nrespondent Bank in its counter that the deponent of the affidavit filed in\nsupport of the writ petition clearly stated in the suit as D.W.2 that the\nperson who opened the LC becomes the beneficiary under the Bank  \nGuarantee and the opener of the second LC, M/s Warrenby UK, did not  \ninvoke the Bank Guarantee. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">18.     A perusal of the pleadings in the writ affidavit candidly shows that\nthe petitioners are requesting this Court to adjudicate as to whether the\ninterpretation given by the respondents on the terms of the contract i.e.,\nBank Guarantee is correct or not and for enforcement of the same in\naccordance with the interpretation of the petitioners.  It is also to be\nnoted that virtually the petitioners are asking for the relief of\nenforcement of contract and for recovery of amount by way of this writ\npetition.  The amenability of the said reliefs for the jurisdiction of this\nCourt under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is required to be\nexamined in the light of the principles and parameters laid down by the\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court and this Court.  This Court in Canara Bank,\nSecunderabad v. Power Grid Corporation of India Ltd., New Delhi (16\nsupra) categorically held that for money claim, writ petition is not\nmaintainable under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_113\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"318728\" id=\"span_47\">In the\njudgment reported in <a href=\"/doc/318728/\" id=\"a_114\">Kerala State Electricity Board and another v.
