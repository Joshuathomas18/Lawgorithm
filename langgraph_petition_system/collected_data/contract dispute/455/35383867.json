It is the contention of the petitioner that the respondent did not\n                          pay the sums payable under the MoU, as a result of which it was\n                          entitled to claim its dues under the 2014 Contract. Consequently, the\n                          petitioner invoked the arbitration clause contained in the 2014\n                          Contract, by a letter dated 27.07.2016, and the learned arbitrator was\n                          appointed pursuant to order dated 28.07.2017, passed by this Court in\n                          proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 11</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">                          7.     The petitioner lodged seven claims before the learned arbitrator,\n                          amounting to â‚¹35,17,69,185/-. The respondent raised a preliminary\n                          objection as to the arbitrability of the disputes on the basis of the\n                          execution of the MoU. It also contended that the respondent had, in\n                          fact, paid an excess amount of â‚¹32,83,865/- to the petitioner, which it\n                          was entitled to claim.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_19\">                          8.     The learned arbitrator, by an order dated 15.10.2018, framed six\n                          issues, of which the following two issues were decided as preliminary\n                          issues:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">                                 &quot;4.

The learned arbitrator came to the conclusion that the MoU\n                          crystallized the liability of the respondent at â‚¹132 lakhs, subject to the\n                          petitioner handing over the assets and consumables, mentioned in the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">By:SHITU NAGPAL           O.M.P.(COMM) 190/2019                                                Page 5 of 21</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Signing Date:03.06.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">21:36:05</span>\n                           annexure thereto, to the respondent. Noting that a sum of â‚¹67,86,200/-\n                          was paid by the respondent to the petitioner [which was not disclosed\n                          in the statement of claims], the learned arbitrator came to the\n                          conclusion that, even upon the petitioner&#x27;s case that the MoU was not\n                          fully complied with, it would not lead to the conclusion that the\n                          arbitration clause contained in the 2014 Contract stood revived. As the\n                          parties moved from a BoQ/item rate basis of payment in the 2014\n                          Contract to a &quot;cost plus&quot; basis in the MoU, the learned arbitrator\n                          found that there could be no question of &quot;revival&quot; of the 2014\n                          Contract, even if the MoU&#x27;s terms were breached. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"6614437\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"190370690\" id=\"span_29\">In coming to this\n                          conclusion, he relied upon the judgment of the Supreme Court in\n                          <a href=\"/doc/190370690/\" id=\"a_4\">Young Achievers vs. IMS Learning Resources Pvt.

Mr. Ashish Dholakia, learned Senior Counsel for the petitioner,\n                          submitted that the interpretation of the contracts in the impugned\n                          award is arbitrary and perverse, rendering the award manifestly illegal.\n                          He submitted that Clause 1 of the MoU states that the 2014 Contract\n                          will stand satisfied only upon fulfillment of the conditions enumerated\n                          thereunder, and the respondent had admittedly not made full payment\n                          of the sum of â‚¹132 lakhs, mentioned in sub-clause A thereof. Relying\n                          upon Clause 1(C) of the MoU, Mr. Dholakia submitted that, in such\n                          circumstances, the petitioner was entitled to claim all dues under the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                          3</span>\n                              (2013) 10 SCC 535.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                          4</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                              2018 SCC OnLine Del 12866.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">By:SHITU NAGPAL           O.M.P.(COMM) 190/2019                                           Page 6 of 21</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">Signing Date:03.06.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">21:36:05</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">                           2014 Contract, and to &quot;file any legal measures&quot; for this purpose. He\n                          further argued that Clause 3 of the MoU contemplated execution of a\n                          new contract on cost plus basis, which was not done. Therefore, he\n                          submitted that the claims placed before the learned arbitrator were\n                          under the 2014 Contract - not under the MoU - and were thus correctly\n                          agitated by way of arbitral proceedings. According to Mr. Dholakia,\n                          the observations in the impugned award have the effect of taking away\n                          the petitioner&#x27;s right to make claims for its dues and losses under the\n                          2014 Contract, contrary to the express terms of Clause 1(C) of the\n                          MoU.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">                          11.       Factually, Mr. Dholakia submitted that, even after the execution\n                          of the MoU, the petitioner continued to raise running account bills\n                          under the 2014 Contract, which has been explained away by the\n                          learned arbitrator as being in anticipation of the new contract between\n                          the parties. He contended that the aforesaid explanation does not bear\n                          scrutiny, particularly in the context of a wholesale rejection of the\n                          arbitral claims without evidence on the issue of arbitrability.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1391279\" id=\"span_37\">12.       According to Mr. Dholakia, the learned arbitrator missed the\n                          conditional nature of cancellation of the 2014 Contract. He\n                          distinguished the judgment in Young Achievers5 also on this basis,\n                          arguing that no future relationship between the parties was\n                          contemplated therein.

As far as the fulfillment of the\n                          conditions mentioned in Clause 1 of the MoU are concerned, he\n                          submitted that reciprocal conditions were placed upon both the parties\n                          and the respondent&#x27;s failure to make full payment thereunder is due to\n                          the petitioner not having handed over the consumables mentioned in\n                          the annexure to the MoU.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1545494\" id=\"span_46\">15.

In the context of these submissions, the first task before the\n                          Court is to examine the judgments which deal with the question of\n                          whether an arbitration clause survives a supervening agreement\n                          between the parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">                          17.        On this question, the learned arbitrator referred to the judgment\n                          in Young Achievers 10, wherein the Supreme Court in held as follows:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">                                     &quot;5.     We are of the view that survival of the arbitration clause,\n                                     as sought by the appellant in the agreements dated 1-4-2007 and\n                                     1-4-2010 has to be seen in the light of the terms and conditions of\n                                     the new agreement dated 1-2-2011. An arbitration clause in an\n                                     agreement cannot survive if the agreement containing arbitration\n                                     clause has been superseded/novated by a later agreement.

The exit paper would clearly indicate that it is a mutually\n                                  agreed document containing comprehensive terms and conditions\n                                  which admittedly does not contain an arbitration clause. We are of\n                                  the view that the High Court is right in taking the view that the\n                                  case on hand, is not a case involving assertion by the respondent of\n                                  accord a satisfaction in respect of the earlier contracts dated 1-4-\n                                  2007 and 1-4-2010. If that be so, it could have referred to the\n                                  arbitrator in terms of those two agreements going by the dictum\n                                  in <a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_11\">Union of India v.

The principle laid down is that if the\n                                  contract is superseded by another, the arbitration clause, being a\n                                  component part of the earlier contract, falls with it. But where the\n                                  dispute is whether such contract is void ab intio, the arbitration\n                                  clause cannot operate on those disputes, for its operative force\n                                  depends upon the existence of the contract and its validity. The\n                                  various other observations were made by this Court in the\n                                  abovementioned judgment in respect of &quot;settlement of disputes\n                                  arising under the original contract, including the dispute as to the\n                                  breach of the contract and its consequences.&quot;</span> The principle <a href=\"/doc/1391279/\" id=\"a_13\">laid\n                                  down by</a> the House of Lords in Heyman v.

We may indicate that so far as the present case is\n                                  concerned, parties have entered into a fresh contract contained in\n                                  the exit paper which does not even indicate any disputes arising\n                                  under the original contract or about the settlement thereof, it is\n                                  nothing but a pure and simple novation of the original contract\n                                  by mutual consent. Above being the factual and legal position, we\n                                  find no error in the view taken by the High Court. The appeal,\n                                  therefore, lacks merit and stands dismissed, with no order as to\n                                  costs.&quot;11\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">                          18.

The Court held as follows: -\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">                                     &quot;10. The following principles relevant to the present case emerge\n                                     from the aforesaid discussion : (1) An arbitration clause is a\n                                     collateral term of a contract as distinguished from its substantive\n                                     terms; but nonetheless it is an integral part of it; (2) however\n                                     comprehensive the terms of an arbitration clause may be, the\n                                     existence of the contract is a necessary condition for its\n                                     operation; it perishes with the contract; (3) the contract may be\n                                     non est in the sense that it never came legally into existence or it\n                                     was void ab initio; (4) though the contract was validly executed,\n                                     the parties may put an end to it as if it had never existed and\n                                     substitute a new contract for it solely governing their rights and\n                                     liabilities thereunder; (5) in the former case, if the original\n                                     contract has no legal existence, the arbitration clause also cannot\n                                     operate, for along with the original contract, it is also void; in the\n                                     latter case, as the original contract is extinguished by the\n                                     substituted one, the arbitration clause of the original contract\n                                     perishes with it; and (6) between the two falls many categories of\n                                     disputes in connection with a contract, such as the question of\n                                     repudiation, frustration, breach etc. In those cases it is the\n                                     performance of the contract that has come to an end, but the\n                                     contract is still in existence for certain purposes in respect of\n                                     disputes arising under it or in connection with it. As the contract\n                                     subsists for certain purposes, the arbitration clause operates in\n                                     respect of these purposes.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">                                     11.      We have held that the three contracts were settled and the\n                                     third settlement contract was in substitution of the three contracts;\n                                     and, after its execution, all the earlier contracts were extinguished\n                                     and the arbitration clause contained therein also perished along\n                                     with them. We have also held that the new contract was not a\n                                     conditional one and after its execution the parties should work out\n                                     their rights only under its terms. In this view, the judgment of the\n                                     High Court is correct. This appeal fails and is dismissed with\n                                     costs.&quot;15\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">                          19.

There is, in our\n                                     view, a basic fallacy underlying this submission. A contract is the\n                                     creature of an agreement between the parties and where the parties\n                                     under the terms of the contract agree to incorporate an arbitration\n                                     clause, that clause stands apart from the rights and obligations\n                                     under that contract, as it has been incorporated with the object of\n                                     providing a machinery for the settlement of disputes arising in\n                                     relation to or in connection with that contract. The questions of\n                                     unilateral repudiation of the rights and obligations under the\n                                     contract or of a full and final settlement of the contract relate to\n                                     the performance or discharge of the contract. Far from putting an\n                                     end to the arbitration clause, they fall within the purview of it. A\n                                     repudiation by one party alone does not terminate the contract. It\n                                     takes two to end it, and hence it follows that as the contract\n                                     subsists for the determination of the rights and obligations of the\n                                     parties, the arbitration clause also survives. This is not a case\n                                     where the plea is that the contract is void, illegal or fraudulent etc.\n                                     in which case, the entire contract along with the arbitration clause\n                                     is non est, or voidable. As the contract is an outcome of the\n                                     agreement between the parties it is equally open to the parties\n                                     thereto to agree to bring it to an end or to treat it as if it never\n                                     existed. It may also be open to the parties to terminate the\n                                     previous contract and substitute in its place a new contract or\n                                     alter the original contract in such a way that it cannot subsist. In\n                                     all these cases, since the entire contract is put an end to, the\n                                     arbitration clause, which is a part of it, also perishes along with\n                                     it. <a href=\"/doc/595325/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 62</a> of the Contract Act incorporates this principle when\n                                     it provides that if the parties to a contract agree to substitute a new\n                                     contract or to rescind or alter it, the original contract need not be\n                                     performed. Where, therefore, the dispute between the parties is that\n                                     the contract itself does not subsist either as a result of its being\n                                     substituted by a new contract or by rescission or alteration, that\n                                     dispute cannot be referred to the arbitration as the arbitration\n                                     clause itself would perish if the averment is found to be valid. As\n                                     the very jurisdiction of the arbitrator is dependent upon the\n                                     existence of the arbitration clause under which he is appointed, the\n                                     parties have no right to invoke a clause which perishes with the\n                                     contract.&quot;20\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">                          23.

It is\n                                  inconceivable to infer that the parties intended its revival on failure\n                                  of the respondent to make the complete payment as described in the\n                                  MOU. The fact that the MOU did not provide for the survival of\n                                  arbitration clause, unequivocally indicates that the parties had\n                                  given up the terms of the old contract including the arbitration\n                                  clause. The MOU dated 08.10.15 does not whisper about settlement\n                                  of any dispute arising under the original contract through\n                                  arbitration. Needless to say execution of MOU is. a pure novation\n                                  of the original contract by mutual consent of the parties. Settled\n                                  position is that where a contract containing an arbitration clause is\n                                  substituted by another contract, the arbitration clause perishes with\n                                  the original contract unless there is anything in the new contract to\n                                  show that the parties intended the arbitration clause in the original\n                                  contract to survive.&quot;21\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">                          26.

It can safely be concluded that the original contract between\n                                  the parties had come to an end on execution of the MOU. Once\n                                  there is a full and final settlement in respect of all the disputes, in\n                                  relation to a matter covered under the arbitration clause in the\n                                  contract, such disputes or differences do not remain to be an\n                                  arbitrable dispute and the arbitration clause can&#x27;t be invoked.

While examining these findings of the learned arbitrator, it must\n                          be remembered that interference by Courts with arbitral awards on the\n                          ground of patent illegality is permitted only in limited circumstances.\n                          On questions of contractual interpretation, the findings of the arbitral\n                          tribunal, being the domestic tribunal of choice, are generally to be\n                          respected, unless they are found to be irrational or perverse, in the\n                          sense that the interpretation is so implausible that no reasonable\n                          person could have arrived at it.

This Court has in several other judgments interpreted <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_20\">Section\n                                     34</a> of the 1996 Act to stress on the restraint to be shown by Courts\n                                     while examining the validity of the arbitral awards. The limited\n                                     grounds available to Courts for annulment of arbitral awards are\n                                     well known to legally trained minds. However, the difficulty arises\n                                     in applying the well-established principles for interference to the\n                                     facts of each case that come up before the Courts. There is a\n                                     disturbing tendency of Courts setting aside arbitral awards, after\n                                     dissecting and reassessing factual aspects of the cases to come to\n                                     a conclusion that the award needs intervention and thereafter,\n                                     dubbing the award to be vitiated by either perversity or patent\n                                     illegality, apart from the other grounds available for annulment\n                                     of the award. This approach would lead to corrosion of the object\n                                     of the 1996 Act and the endeavours made to preserve this object,\n                                     which is minimal judicial interference with arbitral awards. That\n                                     apart, several judicial pronouncements of this Court would\n                                     become a dead letter if arbitral awards are set aside by\n                                     categorising them as perverse or patently illegal without\n                                     appreciating the contours of the said expressions.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_70\">                                     29. Patent illegality should be illegality which goes to the root of\n                                     the matter. In other words, every error of law committed by the\n                                     Arbitral Tribunal would not fall within the expression &quot;patent\n                                     illegality&quot;. Likewise, erroneous application of law cannot be\n                                     categorised as patent illegality. In addition, contravention of law\n                                     not linked to public policy or public interest is beyond the scope of\n                                     the expression &quot;patent illegality&quot;. What is prohibited is for Courts\n                                     to reappreciate evidence to conclude that the award suffers from\n                                     patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, as Courts do\n                                     not sit in appeal against the arbitral award. The permissible\n                                     grounds for interference with a domestic award under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_21\">Section\n                                     34</a>(2-A) on the ground of patent illegality is when the arbitrator\n                                     takes a view which is not even a possible one, or interprets a\n                                     clause in the contract in such a manner which no fair-minded or\n                                     reasonable person would, or if the arbitrator commits an error of\n                                     jurisdiction by wandering outside the contract and dealing with\n                                     matters not allotted to them. An arbitral award stating no reasons\n                                     for its findings would make itself susceptible to challenge on this\n                                     account.

We need to be\n                                  cognizant of the fact that arbitral awards should not be interfered\n                                  with in a casual and cavalier manner, unless the Court comes to a\n                                  conclusion that the perversity of the award goes to the root of the\n                                  matter without there being a possibility of alternative\n                                  interpretation which may sustain the arbitral award. <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 34</a> is\n                                  different in its approach and cannot be equated with a normal\n                                  appellate jurisdiction. The mandate under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 34</a> is to respect\n                                  the finality of the arbitral award and the party autonomy to get\n                                  their dispute adjudicated by an alternative forum as provided\n                                  under the law. If the Courts were to interfere with the arbitral\n                                  award in the usual course on factual aspects, then the commercial\n                                  wisdom behind opting for alternate dispute resolution would stand\n                                  frustrated.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_73\">                                  22. In the instant case, we are of the view that the interpretation of\n                                  the relevant clauses of the implementation agreement, as arrived at\n                                  by the learned sole arbitrator, are both, possible and plausible.\n                                  Merely because another view could have been taken, can hardly\n                                  be a ground for the learned Single Judge to have interfered with\n                                  the arbitral award. In the given facts and circumstances of the\n                                  case, the appellate court has rightly held that the learned Single\n                                  Judge exceeded his jurisdiction in interfering with the award by\n                                  questioning the interpretation given to the relevant clauses of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">                          29</span>\n                             Emphasis supplied.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                          30</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">                             (2022) 4 SCC 116.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">                          31</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">                             (2019) 20 SCC 1.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">By:SHITU NAGPAL           O.M.P.(COMM) 190/2019                                                    Page 19 of 21</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">Signing Date:03.06.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">21:36:05</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_76\">                                      implementation agreement, as the reasons given are backed by\n                                     logic.&quot;32\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_77\">                          30.        Viewed from this perspective, I am unable to accept Mr.\n                          Dholakia&#x27;s submissions that the impugned award suffers from patent\n                          illegality. The question of whether the 2014 Contract stands novated\n                          by the MoU is itself a question of contractual interpretation. This\n                          Court, under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 34</a> of the Act, is not required to accord its own\n                          interpretation to the contractual documents, but only to assess whether\n                          the provisions are capable of the interpretation placed upon them in\n                          the impugned award.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_78\">                          31.        The learned arbitrator has placed an interpretation upon the\n                          terms of the MoU which, in my view, is plausible. Clause 1 of the\n                          MoU records the terms upon which the 2014 Contract &quot;will stand fully\n                          satisfied towards both the parties&quot;. However, this does not lead to an\n                          invariable conclusion that the 2014 Contract would stand revived, if\n                          those terms were not fulfilled. The last recital speaks of the parties&#x27;\n                          decision to &quot;to cancel the above said &#x27;construction agreement&#x27;.\n                          Clause 1(C) of the MoU, relied upon by the petitioner itself, refers to\n                          it as &quot;the closed contract&quot;. Clause 3 thereof incorporates an\n                          agreement between the parties to &quot;cancel&quot; the 2014 Contract, without\n                          reference to the conditions enumerated in Clause 1, albeit in\n                          contemplation of a new contract. There is no express or clearly\n                          implicit provision that the 2014 Contract would stand revived on\n                          account of any breach of the terms contained in Clause 1 of the MoU.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                          32</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_79\">                               Emphasis supplied.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_139\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_140\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">By:SHITU NAGPAL           O.M.P.(COMM) 190/2019                                              Page 20 of 21</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">Signing Date:03.06.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">21:36:05</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_80\">                           32.    The conclusion of the learned arbitrator that the MoU\n                          constituted a novation of the 2014 Contract is, therefore,\n                          unimpeachable within the limited jurisdiction of the Court under\n                          <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 34</a> of the Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_81\">                          33.

Suffice it\n                          to say that the impugned award only holds that the arbitration\n                          agreement in the 2014 Contract perished upon execution of the MoU,\n                          and does not render any conclusive findings upon the rights and\n                          obligations of the parties under the MoU, including Clause 1(C)\n                          thereof.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_82\">                          Conclusion\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_83\">                          34.
