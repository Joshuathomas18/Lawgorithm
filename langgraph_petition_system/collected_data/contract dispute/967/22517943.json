It is also not in dispute that the LOA is dated 24.12.2004 and\n\n                      therefore, said six months time frame elapsed on 23.06.2005. Be that as it\n\n                      may, it is also not in dispute that the value of the said contract is\n\n                      Rs.1,09,56,069/- (Rupees One Crore Nine Lakhs Fifty Six Thousand and Sixty\n\n                      Nine only).

It is also submitted that with regard to 7\n\n                   extensions, while 6 extensions were made under Clause 17-A(ii) of General\n\n                   Conditions of Contract (GCC), one extension granted on 30.11.2006 was\n\n                   under Clause 17-B of GCC. To be noted, the essential difference between\n\n                   Clauses 17(A) and 17(B) of GCC is that extension under Clause 17-A is\n\n                   without &#x27;Liquidated Damages&#x27; (&#x27;LD&#x27; for brevity) and extension under Clause\n\n                   17-B is with LD. For the purpose of further clarity, it is to be mentioned that\n\n                   this Court is informed that an extension under Clause 17(B) with LD would\n\n                   mean that when any extension is granted under this clause 17(B), the LD will\n\n                   be deducted from the bills payable. In other words, this court is informed that\n\n                   this is the procedure that was operated qua said contract.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_10\">                                     8.

Before this Court proceeds further with discussion in the\n\n                      instant OP, it is to be noted that said contract, is to be read along with GCC\n\n                      and another document, which is captioned &#x27;Special Conditions of Contract&#x27;. In\n\n                      other words, it is the specific submission made on both sides before this Court\n\n                      that the said Contract (which governs the entire said work between the\n\n                      parties) was constituted by aforesaid agreement dated 14.03.2005, GCC and\n\n                      special conditions of Contract. Therefore, reference to said Contract would\n\n                      necessarily mean a reference to agreement dated 14.03.2005, GCC and\n\n                      special conditions of Contract collectively.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">                                     10.

It was submitted that this review,\n\n                      i.e., Application No.6446 of 2007 came to be disposed of on 24.10.2007 and a\n\n                      learned Judge of this Court disposed of the review, by holding that it is open\n\n                      to Southern Railways, to grant extension on terms and conditions and for a\n\n                      period which is desirable at its discretion.

Adverting to paragraph 7, learned counsel for Contractor,\n\n                      contended that this Court had permitted Southern Railways, to extend the\n\n                      period and the decision with regard to period / length of extension alone has\n\n                      been left to Southern Railways.      A careful reading of the aforesaid order\n\n                      leaves this Court with no doubt that both the terms and conditions on which\n\n                      the extension is to be granted as well as period for which extension is to be\n\n                      granted are left to the decision of Southern Railways, as this Court has clearly\n\n                      held that the conditions subject to which the period is extended and also the\n\n                      period for which it is extended are left to the decision of the Railways.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">                                    38.

Now that extension is under Clause 17(B), the question is\n\n                      whether Southern Railways was correct in deducting the LD and deducting\n\n                      the same from the bills and monies payable qua the bills to the contractor.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">                                    40.

A careful perusal of the Arbitral Award and the manner in\n\n                  which AT has dealt with this issue will make it clear that AT has appreciated\n\n                  evidence and materials before it and come to a conclusion. Any argument to\n\n                  the contrary / assailing the same will necessarily mean examination of the\n\n                  matter on merits again and it will also entail appreciation of evidence as\n\n                  enough and more evidence was before AT in this regard. In this context, this\n\n                  Court reminds itself of the time honoured Hodgkinson principle, which is to\n\n                  the effect that AT is the sole and final judge of the quantity and quality of\n\n                  evidence before it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">                                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"31621011\" id=\"span_30\">42. To be noted, the Hodgkinson principle has been referred to\n\n                  and explained by Honourable Supreme Court, in the celebrated and oft-\n\n                  quoted Associate Builders case being <a href=\"/doc/31621011/\" id=\"a_15\">Associate Builders Vs.

Therefore, this Court is unable to persuade itself to accept\n\n                  the contention of the learned counsel for Southern Railways that AT erred in\n\n                  awarding refund of LD. This Court finds no ground for judicial intervention\n\n                  with regard to the impugned award made by AT as far as it relates to\n\n                  direction to refund of LD. A perusal of claim as can be culled out from the\n\n                  impugned award would reveal that besides directing refund of LD, AT has also\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.inawarded   interest of Rs.1,66,901/- (little over Rs.1.66 lakhs).\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">\f                                                            27</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">                                     44. The question is whether AT could have awarded this\n\n                   interest. There is no dispute or disagreement that Rs.1,66,901/- is pendente\n\n                   lite interest. If it is pendente lite interest, the same can be awarded only if it\n\n                   is prescribed in the contract is learned standing counsel&#x27;s say.         Learned\n\n                   standing counsel for Southern Railways drew the attention of this Court to\n\n                   SREE KAMATCHI AMMAN CONSTRUCTIONS vs. DIVISIONAL RAILWAY\n\n                   MANAGER (WORKS), PALGHAT AND OTHERS reported in (2010) 8 SCC 767,\n\n                   in respect of pendente lite interest. To be noted, this was followed by another\n\n                   learned brother Judge of this Court in DEPUTY CHIEF ENGINEER\n\n                   (CONSTRUCTION) vs. VISHAL CONSTRUCTIONS reported in 2018 (3) CTC\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                   285.</span>\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">                                     45. Though there is a tome of case laws and trove of principles\n\n                   qua pendente lite interest, aforesaid case laws alone were pressed into\n\n                   service and these case laws support the argument that award of pendente lite\n\n                   is impermissible unless contract provides for the same. No further elucidation\n\n                   or elaboration is required with regard to the principle that pendente lite\n\n                   interest can be awarded only when contract provides for the same in the light\n\n                   facts and circumstances of instant case. There is no dispute or disagreement\n\n                   that pendente lite interest portion of impugned award warrants judicial\n\n                   intervention and it follows as a sequittur that, that portion of impugned award\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.inneeds   to be set aside. However, to be noted AT has also awarded post award\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">\f                                                            28</span>\n\n                   interest. AT has made it clear that the monies awarded under impugned\n\n                   award are to be paid within 45 days from the date of signing the impugned\n\n                   award, failing which it will carry simple interest at the rate of 8% from the\n\n                   date of award i.e., from 09.05.2009 to the date of realisation. To be noted in\n\n                   the impugned award, there is mention about 8% which does not say whether\n\n                   it is per annum or per month.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">                                    46. Considering the nature of matter, both sides agree that it is\n\n                   obviously interest at the rate of 8% per annum. This the contractor will\n\n                   certainly be entitled to. In other words, it is made clear that post award\n\n                   interest is at the discretion of AT. In the instant case, AT has awarded a very\n\n                   reasonable interest i.e., 8% per annum from the date of impugned award to\n\n                   the date of realisation. Therefore, the net result should be that the contractor\n\n                   would be entitled to refund of LD recovered in a sum of Rs.5,69,122/- with\n\n                   future interest at the rate of 8% per annum from the date of award i.e.\n\n                   09.05.2009 to the date of realisation. To be noted, it is not in dispute before\n\n                   this Court, no payment was made within 45 days from the date of impugned\n\n                   award as stipulated therein.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">                                    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1292137\" id=\"span_34\">47. Before concluding, this Court also makes it clear that while\n\n                   testing the impugned award on merits, this Court has reminded itself of the\n\n                   Fiza Developers principle laid down in Fiza Developers and Inter-Trade\n\nhttp://www.judis.nic.inPrivate   <a href=\"/doc/1292137/\" id=\"a_16\">Limited Vs.
