The facts leading to the present appeal and the case on behalf of\n\nthe appellant – NHAI are as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">2.1   That the NHAI and the respondent entered into a contract. An\n\nEngineering   Procurement     and     Construction   (EPC)    Agreement\n\n(hereinafter referred to as “Contract”) was executed between the parties\n\non 13.11.2014 in respect of &quot;improvement / augmentation of two laning\n\nwith paved shoulders from km.94/000 to km.174/000 (design chainage\n\nfrom km.94/000 to km.174/000) of Karaikudi-Ramanathapuram Section\n\nof National Highway No. 210 including 500m on SH-35 Madurai Road\n\n(near Devakottai Rasta Railway Station) in the State of Tamil Nadu on\n\nEPC mode (total design length 80.00kms) under NHDP PHASE-III”.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">2.2   According to the NHAI, the respondent/Contractor was in\n\ncontinuous breach of specific obligations under the Contract for which a\n\ncure period notice was issued by the NHAI under Clause 23.1.1 of the\n\nContract as far as back on 29.09.2015 calling upon the Contractor to\n\ncure the defaults within 60 days.     The Contractor failed to cure the\n\ndefects pointed out by the NHAI, thus, a notice of intention to terminate\n\nthe Contract was issued by the NHAI on 12.04.2016 under Clause\n\n23.1.2. The respondent/Contractor sent its reply dated 14.04.2016 to the\n\nNHAI&#x27;s notice of intention to terminate the contract. Having found the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                                                        2</span>\n\freply totally unsatisfactory, the NHAI issued a termination notice dated\n\n22.07.2016 under Clause 23.1.2 of the Contract. It is the case on behalf\n\nof the appellant – NHAI that the NHAI specifically stated in the\n\ntermination notice that &quot;the same is without prejudice to the Authority&#x27;s\n\nright to claim damages for the Contractor&#x27;s failure to comply with the\n\nunambiguous obligations casted upon it under the Contract and/or to\n\nrealize any dues, losses and damages whatsoever under the Contract or\n\nunder applicable laws, as the case may be&quot;.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">2.3   On receipt of the termination notice, the respondent/Contractor\n\naddressed a letter to the NHAI on 02.01.2017 to refer certain disputes\n\nfor amicable settlement under Clause 26.2 of the Contract.          That\n\nthereafter, the Contractor invoked the arbitration clause (Clause 26 of\n\nthe Contract) vide letter dated 09.02.2017 and nominated its Arbitrator\n\nand requested the NHAI to nominate its Arbitrator so that the Presiding\n\nArbitrator may be appointed. The NHAI nominated its arbitrator by letter\n\ndated 10.03.2017 which was followed by the appointment of the\n\nPresiding Arbitrator. Accordingly, the Arbitral Tribunal came to be\n\nconstituted. The Contractor filed the Statement of Claim on 15.05.2017.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">The NHAI filed its statement of defence on 11.07.2017. It is the case on\n\nbehalf of the NHAI that both in the termination notice dated 22.07.2016\n\nas well as in the Statement of Defence dated 11.07.2017, the NHAI\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                                                        3</span>\n\freserved its right to claim damages and stated that it would file its\n\ncounter claim separately.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">2.4   On 13.07.2017, i.e., after two days of filing the Statement of\n\nDefence by the NHAI, the NHAI sent a letter to the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nseeking extension of time for filing the counter claim. Vide email dated\n\n18.07.2017 the Arbitral Tribunal rejected the NHAI&#x27;s request seeking\n\nextension of time for filing the counter claim and stated that no\n\napplication has been filed by the NHAI for filing counter claim. It appears\n\nthat thereafter the NHAI moved an application before the Arbitral\n\nTribunal under <a href=\"/doc/238279/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 23(2A)</a> of the Arbitration Act to place its counter\n\nclaim on record. It appears that on the very same day, the NHAI filed its\n\ncounter claim before the Arbitral Tribunal. The Arbitral Tribunal rejected\n\nthe NHAI&#x27;s application permitting it to place on record the counter claim\n\nvide order dated 15.09.2017, essentially on the ground that the\n\nprocedure under Clauses 26.1 and 26.2 had not been followed by the\n\nNHAI and therefore, the counter claim was beyond the scope of\n\narbitration agreement and adjudication of the said dispute is not within\n\nthe jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">2.5   Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the order passed by the\n\nArbitral Tribunal dated 15.09.2017 dismissing the application filed by the\n\nNHAI seeking permission to place on record the counter claim and\n\nholding that the dispute raised by the NHAI in the counter claim is not\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                                                         4</span>\n\fwithin the scope of arbitration agreement and that the dispute sought to\n\nbe filed is contractually not arbitrable and the adjudication of the said\n\ndispute is not within the jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal, NHAI\n\npreferred the appeal under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996 before\n\nthe High Court of Delhi.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">2.6   Before the High Court, an objection was raised on behalf of the\n\nContractor on maintainability of the application under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 34</a> of the\n\nArbitration Act, 1996.     However, treating the order dated 15.09.2017\n\npassed under <a href=\"/doc/1746186/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 16(2)</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996, the High Court\n\nhas treated the proceedings before it as one under <a href=\"/doc/1269652/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 37(2)</a> of the\n\nArbitration Act, 1996 while deciding on the admissibility of the counter\n\nclaim and thereafter has decided the same on merits.\n\n2.7   By the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has\n\ndismissed the said application and has confirmed the order passed by\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal dated 15.09.2017 rejecting the application submitted\n\nby NHAI to take the counter claim on record.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">2.8   Feeling aggrieved and dissatisfied with the impugned judgment\n\nand order passed by the High Court, the NHAI has preferred the present\n\nappeal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">3.

Ms. Madhavi Diwan, learned ASG appearing on behalf of the NHAI\n\nhas vehemently submitted that in the facts and circumstances of the\n\ncase, the High Court has committed a grave/serious error in confirming\n\nthe order passed by the Arbitral Tribunal not taking on record the counter\n\nclaim filed by the NHAI.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">4.1   it is further submitted by Ms. Diwan, learned ASG that, both, the\n\nArbitral Tribunal as well as the High Court have failed to appreciate that\n\nthe counter claim was based on common/overlapping cause of action. It\n\nis submitted that the arbitration invoked by the Contractor arose out of\n\nthe very termination notice which had been issued by the NHAI.\n\nTherefore, the foundation of the Contractor’s case before the Arbitral\n\nTribunal is the validity of such termination. Therefore, there was no\n\nquestion of seeking to hair split the dispute between the parties. It would\n\nlead to unnecessary multiplicity of proceedings and needless cost and\n\ninconvenience when the evidence itself is also common because the\n\ndispute arises out of the same transaction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"31559077\" id=\"span_10\">4.2   It is further submitted by Ms. Diwan, learned ASG that as such\n\nClause 26 can be invoked by either party. It is submitted that Clause 26\n\nof the Contract is self-explanatory, where it refers to &#x27;any dispute&#x27;,\n\ndifference or controversy being required to be attempted to be amicably\n\nresolved in accordance with the conciliation procedure under Clause\n\n26.2. It is submitted that the provision requires the same to be notified in\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                                           6</span>\n\fwriting by either party. Likewise, Clause 26.2 states that either party may\n\ncall upon the Authority&#x27;s Engineer or such other person as the parties\n\nmay mutually agree upon to mediate and arrive at an amicable\n\nsettlement. It is submitted that the reason and the rationale behind\n\npermitting either party to invoke Clause 26.1 is that by its very definition\n\n&#x27;a dispute&#x27; is two sided. On interpretation of the word ‘dispute’, reliance is\n\nplaced upon the decisions of this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/31559077/\" id=\"a_8\">Gujarat State\n\nCooperative Land Development Bank Ltd. Vs. P.R. Mankad and\n\nOrs.</a>, (1979) 3 SCC 123 (para22) and Major (Retd.)</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"20683\" id=\"span_12\"><a href=\"/doc/20683/\" id=\"a_9\">Inder Singh Rekhi\n\nVS. Delhi Development Authority</a>, (1988) 2 SCC 338 (para 4).\n\n4.3   Relying upon the aforesaid two decisions, it is further submitted by\n\nMs. Madhavi Diwan, learned ASG that in the present case, the word\n\n&quot;Dispute&quot; has been used by the Contractor itself in its notice dated\n\n02.01.2017 as well as in his letter dated 09.02.2017 whereby the\n\nContractor itself had referred the Termination Notice as an unilateral\n\ndecision from which a &quot;Dispute&quot; has arisen. It is submitted that thus, the\n\nDispute in the present case is with regard to the termination notice dated\n\n22.07.2016 issued by the NHAI. It is submitted that therefore, it would\n\nbe a travesty of process to interpret &quot;Dispute&quot; as only allowing for the\n\nclaim made on behalf of the Contractor to be submitted to the process\n\ncontemplated under Clause 26. It is submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal\n\nand the High Court have failed to appreciate the difference between the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                                                            7</span>\n\fexpressions &#x27;claim&#x27; which may be made by one side and &#x27;Dispute&#x27; which\n\nby its definition has two sides.    It is submitted that the language of\n\nClause 26 itself contemplates that &quot;either party&quot; to the dispute may\n\ninvoke this procedure. It is submitted that therefore there can be no\n\nquestion of duplication of very same process which has been invoked\n\nbeforehand and eventually culminated in arbitration process. It is\n\nsubmitted that the second round under Clause 26 would in any event be\n\nan exercise in futility in as much as very same issue would have been\n\nbrought up namely whether termination of contract was lawful or not,\n\nwhich issue by then was already pending before the Arbitral Tribunal.\n\n4.4   It is further submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal as well as the High\n\nCourt have failed to appreciate that it was the NHAI who was compelled\n\nto terminate the contract after providing sufficient opportunities to the\n\nContractor to cure the defects. The NHAI specifically reserved its right in\n\nthe termination notice itself to claim damages which is a natural\n\nconsequence of termination for Contractor&#x27;s failure to comply with its\n\nobligations. It is submitted that therefore the contention on behalf of the\n\nContractor that the counter claim was by surprise or by way of\n\ncounterblast be stated to be rejected.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_16\">4.5   It is submitted that even it cannot be said that NHAI by submitting\n\nthe counter claim has bypassed the procedure which the parties had\n\nagreed. It is submitted that there can be no question of bypassing the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                                          8</span>\n\fprocedure when that stage has already passed in the present case. It is\n\nsubmitted that Clause 26 does not contemplate repeated invocation of\n\nsame procedure when there is an overlapping cause of action and the\n\nrepetition of process would be completely meaningless.\n\n4.6   It is submitted that as per the settled position of law, rules or\n\nprocedures are the handmaids and not the mistress of justice. The\n\nprocedural provisions cannot be interpreted in a hyper-technical manner\n\nto waste the time and resources of parties contrary to the letter and spirit\n\nof the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_10\">Arbitration Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"132422547\" id=\"span_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"267861\" id=\"span_16\">4.7   It is vehemently submitted by Ms. Diwan, learned ASG that in the\n\npresent case not taking on record the counter claim filed by the NHAI,\n\nthe Arbitral Tribunal and the High Court both have lost sight of the very\n\nobject and purpose of <a href=\"/doc/80036547/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 23(2A)</a> which is meant to provide\n\nconvenience to the parties in being able to file the entirety of their\n\nclaim/counter claim, etc. before the Arbitral Tribunal. It is submitted that\n\ntherefore, there was absolutely no reason for the High Court to have\n\nexcluded the counter claim which was sought to be filed before the\n\nArbitral Tribunal by the NHAI within two days of filing of its Statement of\n\nDefense. It is submitted that <a href=\"/doc/1460737/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 23</a> has been amended pursuant to\n\nthe recommendation of the Law Commission of India in its Report No.\n\n246 &quot;to ensure that counter claims and set off can be adjudicated upon\n\nby an arbitrator without seeking a separate/new reference by the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                                                           9</span>\n\frespondent so long as it falls within the scope of the arbitration\n\nagreement, in order to ensure final settlement of disputes between\n\nparties and prevent multiplicity of litigation&quot;.\n\n4.8   Making above submissions and relying upon the decisions of this\n\nCourt in the case of <a href=\"/doc/267861/\" id=\"a_13\">State of Goa Vs.

It is submitted that the EPC Contract does not\n\ncontemplate parties directly raising claims by directly resorting to\n\narbitration without going through the steps set out in Clause 26. It is\n\nsubmitted that Step 1 can be said to be “Notification of Disputes”. In the\n\nevent that a &quot;dispute, difference, or controversy&quot; has arisen between the\n\nparties, then it has to be &quot;notified in writing&#x27; to the other party. This\n\nnotification can be done by any party which has a dispute. Such\n\nnotification then gives rise to a &quot;Dispute&quot; defined and contemplated\n\nunder Clause 26.1.1 of the EPC Contract\n5.3 It is submitted that Step 2 is with respect to “Resolution by\n\namicable settlement”. Under the Step 2, the parties are then required to\n\nattempt to amicably resolve the “Dispute” in accordance with the\n\nconciliation procedure set out at Clause 26.2.

It\n\nis submitted that therefore a counter claim directly brought before the\n\nTribunal without having been categorised as a “Dispute” in terms of\n\nClause 26.1 and that too by bypassing the mandatory pre-conditions\n\nagreed between the parties would fall outside the scope of the arbitration\n\nagreement as specified under <a href=\"/doc/80036547/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 23(2A)</a> and hence beyond the\n\njurisdiction of the Tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_32\">5.14 Making above submissions, it is vehemently submitted that in the\n\npresent case, both the Arbitral Tribunal as well as the Hon’ble High Court\n\nhave not committed any error in not permitting the NHAI to file the\n\ncounter claim, which was filed straightaway before the Arbitral Tribunal\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                                                                          17</span>\n\fwithout following the procedure as required under Clause 26.

Therefore, thereafter, it is not open for the Contractor to contend\n\nthat the counter claim was without following the procedure as required in\n\nClauses 26.1 and 26.2 and, therefore, may not be taken on record. On\n\na true and fair interpretation of Clause 26, failure to resolve the dispute\n\n(in the present case, the termination of the Contract by the NHAI), the\n\narbitration proceedings would be maintainable.

In this connection the AT has to\n     remind the respondent that at the time of first and\n     preliminary meeting held on 20.04.2017, while fixing the\n     schedule for filing of pleadings by the parties, the AT had\n     specifically brought the fact to the notice of both the parties\n     including the respondent, vide para 12.0 of the minutes of\n     the said meeting, that the present arbitral matter is covered\n     under the Act of 1996 as amended in year 2015 and\n     therefore the adjudication is to be completed within one year\n     and therefore the directions given by the AT shall be\n     complied with within the time frame indicated without being\n     required to seek any postponement or extension of time.\n     Further the last date for filing of the SOD was determined in\n     consultation with the respondent to be on or before\n     30.06.2017. The SOD was however filed by the respondent\n     on 11.07.2017 after seeking an extension of time for 2\n     weeks. The AT had granted the said extension with a view to\n     give the respondent a reasonable opportunity to present its\n     case. Now the respondent is seeking an extension of time\n     for filing of the counterclaims.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_49\">     It may be mentioned here that the claimant has, vide its\n     email dated 18.07.2017, objected to grant of any extension\n     of time for filing of the counterclaims for the reasons stated\n     therein,\n\n     The AT has given thought to request made by the\n     respondent taking into consideration the procedure and\n     schedule of filing of pleadings agreed upon by both the\n     parties as detailed in the Proceedings of the AT dated\n     20.04.2017 and the Act of 1996 as amended in year 2015.\n\n     The AT observes that sub-<a href=\"/doc/1127945/\" id=\"a_35\">sections 23(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/80036547/\" id=\"a_36\">23(2A)</a> of the\n     amended Act of 1996, read together provide that the\n     respondent may, in support of his case, also submit a\n     counterclaim or plead a set-off, along with its Statement of\n     Defence for adjudication by the AT. The AT observes that the\n     respondent has pleaded a set-off of Rs. 1.23 crores vide its\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">                                                                       25</span>\n\f     Statement of Defence; while as regards the counterclaims, it\n     has been stated therein that the respondent reserves its right\n     to file the counterclaims. The respondent has not stated any\n     applicable law in respect of reserving such right.\n\n     In the above background, the AT observes that (i) during the\n     proceedings the procedure and schedule for filing the\n     pleadings were determined by the AT as agreed to by both\n     the parties; that there is no mention therein for filing of the\n     counterclaims by the respondent and (ii) the Statement of\n     Defence has already been filed by the respondent, with set-\n     off and without any counterclaim as per the procedure\n     agreed to by and between the parties, except that the\n     respondent has sue moto reserved its right to file\n     counterclaim at a later date. Thereafter there is no\n     application by the respondent for filing of any counterclaim.\n     In the above circumstances, there is no question of having\n     any date determined by the AT or agreed upon by the parties\n     for filing the counterclaim by the respondent, and if there is\n     no date fixed or agreed upon for filing of the counterclaims,\n     the question of its extension does not arise. Therefore, the\n     AT orders that the request for an extension of time for filing\n     of the counterclaim made by the respondent is not in\n     accordance with applicable law and is irrelevant in view of\n     the factual circumstances as above.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_50\">     In view of the delay in filing of the SOD by the respondent,\n     the claimant shall file its rejoinder thereon, if any, on or\n     before 05.08.2017 and the statement of admission and\n     denial of documents shall be filed by the parties on or before\n     11.08.2017i.e. the date of the next meeting of the AT.\n\n     The above decision of the AT does not preclude the\n     respondent from having another legal remedy in respect of\n     its claims.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">     The above Order is issued by the Presiding Arbitrator in\n     consultation with and on behalf of the AT.”\n\n\n13.3 However, thereafter, when the NHAI filed the application under\n\nsub-section (2A) of <a href=\"/doc/1460737/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 23</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996 seeking to\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                                                       26</span>\n\fplace on record its counter claim, by order dated 15.09.2017, the Arbitral\n\nTribunal rejected the said application by observing that in the application\n\nfor permitting the NHAI to place on record the counter claim, the NHAI\n\nhas not stated anything about having made an attempt for such\n\namicable settlement. However, it is required to be noted that from the\n\nvery beginning, the NHAI reserved its right to claim the damages and\n\neven in the Statement of Defence also claimed such a set off of Rs.1.23\n\ncrores and also specifically stated therein that the NHAI reserved its right\n\nto file the counter claim. Therefore, on the grounds on which the Arbitral\n\nTribunal had rejected the application of NHAI to place on record the\n\ncounter claim can be said to be contrary to the intent between the parties\n\nto resolve the dispute (which was for termination of the Contract by the\n\nNHAI) through conciliation first. In the facts and circumstances of the\n\ncase, by such a narrow interpretation, the Arbitral Tribunal has taken\n\naway the valuable right of the NHAI to submit counter claim, which is of\n\na very huge amount thereby negotiating the statutory and contractual\n\nrights of the NHAI and paving way for a piecemeal and inchoate\n\nadjudication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">13.4 When there is a provision for filing the counter claim – set off,\n\nwhich is expressly inserted in <a href=\"/doc/1460737/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 23</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996,\n\nthere is no reason for curtailing the right of the appellant for making the\n\ncounter claim or set off. If we do not allow the counter claim made by\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                                                         27</span>\n\fthe NHAI in the proceedings arising out of the claims made by the\n\nContractor, it may lead to parallel proceedings before various fora.\n\nWhile passing the impugned judgment and order, the High Court has lost\n\nsight of the aforesaid aspect, which ought to have been considered while\n\nconsidering the request on behalf of the NHAI to place on record its\n\ncounter claim.    Clauses 26.1 and 26.2 have to be interpreted in a\n\npragmatic and practical manner, as they require that the parties must at\n\nfirst try to settle, resolve and even try conciliation but when the\n\nprocedure under Clauses 26.1 and 26.2 fails to yield desired result, in\n\nthe form of settlement within the period specified in Clause 26.2, the\n\nDispute can be resolved through arbitration in terms of Clause 26.3.\n\nOnce any dispute, difference or controversy is notified under Clause\n\n26.1, the entire subject matter including counter claim/set off would form\n\nsubject matter of arbitration as “any dispute which is not resolved in\n\nClauses 26.1 and 26.2”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_53\">13.5 At this stage, it is required to be noted that as such there was no\n\ndelay at all on the part of the NHAI initially praying for extension of time\n\nto file the counter claim and/or thereafter to file application under <a href=\"/doc/80036547/\" id=\"a_39\">Section\n\n23(2A)</a> permitting it to place on record the counter claim. In the facts\n\nand circumstances of the case, we are of the opinion that not permitting\n\nthe NHAI to file the counter claim would defeat the object and purpose of\n\npermitting to file the counter claim/set off as provided under <a href=\"/doc/65067/\" id=\"a_40\">Section\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                                          28</span></a>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/80036547/\" id=\"a_41\">23(2A)</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996. Without appreciating the aforesaid\n\naspects, the High Court has by the impugned judgment and order, and\n\non narrow interpretation of Clause 26 has seriously erred in rejecting the\n\napplication under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 34</a>/<a href=\"/doc/772406/\" id=\"a_43\">37</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1996 and\n\nconfirming the order passed by the Arbitral Tribunal in not permitting the\n\nNHAI to file the counter claim.          The High Court ought to have\n\nappreciated that permitting the NHAI to file the counter claim may avoid\n\nmultiplicity of proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">14.     In view of the above and for the reasons stated above, the order\n\npassed by the Arbitral Tribunal dated 15.09.2017 and the impugned\n\njudgment and order passed by the High Court deserve to be quashed\n\nand     set   aside   and   are   accordingly   quashed   and   set   aside.\n\nConsequently, the application submitted by NHAI to permit it to file the\n\ncounter claim is hereby allowed and the NHAI is permitted to file the\n\ncounter claim, which the Arbitral Tribunal to consider alongwith the\n\nStatement of Claim submitted by the Contractor and the Statement of\n\nDefence of claim submitted by the NHAI on its own merits.
