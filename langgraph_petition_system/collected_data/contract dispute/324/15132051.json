On 09th January, 2018, the learned senior counsel for the parties stated\nthat they did not wish to lead any evidence in the present case.

Since the Defendants were objecting the jurisdiction of this Court to\nhear the present suit, they were asked to commence the arguments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_8\">SUBMISSIONS OF MR. HARISH SALVE, SENIOR COUNSEL FOR\nDEFENDANTS-VODAFONE GROUP\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">5.     At the outset, Mr. Harish Salve, learned senior counsel for Defendants\nclarified that the Defendants did not, by their appearance in Court, accede to\nthe jurisdiction of Indian Courts generally or this Court in particular, and\nhad entered appearance without prejudice to their rights and contentions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">6.     He submitted that the National Courts of India inherently lacked the\njurisdiction to entertain any dispute arising out of a Treaty between two\nsovereign countries. He stated that the Union of India was a party to the\nBilateral Investment Protection Agreement (hereinafter referred to as\n„BIPA‟), a Treaty between two sovereign governments (the Government of\nthe United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland &amp; the Union of\nIndia), and the obligations under such treaties were not subject to domestic\nlaws and disputes arising out of such treaties were not subject to the\njurisdiction of the National Courts. He emphasised that the Courts could not\ninterpret and/or enforce the provisions of Bilateral Investment Treaties as\nthe law made such issues non-justiciable.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 3 of 81</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"> 7.     He emphasised that the Divisional Court of the Queen&#x27;s Bench\nDivision in The Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament v. The Prime\nMinister of the United Kingdom, [2002] EWHC 2777 (Admin) has held,\n&quot;ordinarily speaking, English Courts will not rule upon the true meaning\nand effect of international instruments which apply only at the level of\ninternational law....&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">8.     He also pointed out that the interplay of the jurisdiction of National\nCourts and international law had been considered at some length in the Tin\nCouncil Case [J.H. Rayner (Mincing Lane) Ltd. Vs. Department of Trade\n&amp; Industry &amp; Ors., [1990] 2 AC 418 (House of Lords)]. The relevant\nportion of the said judgment relied upon by him is as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">       &quot; ......if there existed a rule of international law which implied\n       in a treaty or imposed on sovereign states which enter into a\n       treaty, an obligation....to discharge the debts of an\n       international organisation established by that treaty, the rule of\n       international law could only be enforced under international\n       law. Treaty rights and obligations conferred or imposed by\n       agreement or by international law cannot be enforced by the\n       Courts of the United Kingdom.....The Courts of the United\n       Kingdom have no power to enforce at the behest of any\n       sovereign state or at the behest of any individual citizen of any\n       sovereign state rights granted by treaty or obligations imposed\n       in respect of a treaty by international law.... there is no analogy\n       between private international law which enables the courts of\n       the United Kingdom to resolve differences between different\n       laws of different states, and a rule of public international law\n       which imposes obligations on treaty states......However, one\n       approaches the problem, the obligations sought to be imposed\n       on the respondents....stem from the treaty and have no separate\n       existence in domestic law without it.....One has only to envisage\n       a dispute, possibly between the member states and the I.T.C. or\n       possibly between the member states inter se, as to the scope and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                    Page 4 of 81</span>\n        consequence of the authority so agreed to be granted. This\n       must necessarily be a question of the effect of the treaty on the\n       plane of international law and a domestic court has not the\n       competence so as to adjudicate upon the rights of sovereign\n       states.... Thus your Lordships are invited directly to embark\n       upon the exercise of interpreting the terms of the treaty and\n       ascertaining, on the basis of that determination, the rights of\n       the members in international law and the consequences in\n       municipal law of the rights so determined. I see no escape from\n       Mr Pollock&#x27;s submission that this directly infringes the\n       principle of non-justiciability.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">9.     He pointed out that in SGS Société Générale de Surveillance S.A. v.\nIslamic Republic of Pakistan, (ICSID Case No.ARB/01/13) Procedural\nOrder No.2 dated 16 October 2002, the Arbitral Tribunal has held as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">               ―....However, although the Supreme Court Judgment of\n         July 3, 2002 is final as a matter of the law of Pakistan, as a\n         matter of international law, it does not in any way bind this\n         Tribunal....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">               It is clear that SGS has a prima facie right to seek access\n         to international adjudication under the ICSID Convention. It\n         has consented to submit its claim to arbitration under <a href=\"/doc/501118/\" id=\"a_1\">Article\n         9(2)</a> of the Bilateral Investment Treaty....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">               It is essential for the proper operation of both the BIT and\n         the ICSID Convention that the right of access to international\n         adjudication be maintained. In the Tribunal&#x27;s view, it has a\n         duty to protect this right of access and should exercise such\n         powers as are vested in it under <a href=\"/doc/1551554/\" id=\"a_2\">Article 47</a> of the ICSID\n         Convention in furtherance of that duty....\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">               .....The right to seek access to international adjudication\n         must be respected and cannot be constrained by an order of a\n         national court. Nor can a State plead its internal law in defence\n         of an act that is inconsistent with its international obligations.\n         Otherwise, a Contracting State could impede access to ICSID\n         arbitration by operation of its own law....\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 5 of 81</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">               For the foregoing reasons, the Tribunal issues the\n         following recommendations:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">               First, the Tribunal recommends that the Government of\n         Pakistan not take any step to initiate a complaint for contempt.\n         It recommends further that, in the event that any other party,\n         including the Supreme Court of Pakistan sua sponte, were to\n         initiate a complaint, the Government of Pakistan take all\n         necessary steps to inform the Court of the current standing of\n         this proceeding and of the fact that this Tribunal must discharge\n         its duty to determine whether it has the jurisdiction to consider\n         the international claim on the merits. The Government of\n         Pakistan should ensure that if contempt proceedings are\n         initiated by any party, such proceedings not be acted upon...‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">10.    Mr. Salve submitted that the Indian National Courts had neither the\njurisdiction over the subject matter of the dispute (which is a dispute arising\nout of an alleged breach of a Treaty by the Union of India), nor did they\nhave jurisdiction Ratione Personae (i.e. over the Defendants).\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">11.    Learned senior counsel for the Defendants further submitted that\ndomestic law was not a defence to non-performance of the obligations under\na treaty. In support of his submission, he relied upon <a href=\"/doc/1858991/\" id=\"a_3\">Articles 26</a> and <a href=\"/doc/211413/\" id=\"a_4\">27</a> of\nthe Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, which are reproduced\nhereinbelow:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">      ―Article 26. &quot;PACTA SUNT SERVANDA&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">       Every treaty in force is binding upon the parties to it and must\n      be performed by them in good faith.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">      <a href=\"/doc/211413/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 27.</a> INTERNAL LAW AND OBSERVANCE OF\n      TREATIES\n        A party may not invoke the provisions of its internal law as\n      justification for its failure to perform a treaty. This rule is\n      without prejudice to article 46.‖\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 6 of 81</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\"> 12.    According to him, the obligations of a State, under a bilateral or\nmultilateral international treaty, are owed by a Sovereign State to one or\nmore other Sovereign States. He submitted that a breach of treaty\nobligations was a violation of international law and the remedy for this\nwrong had to be found in international law. He contended that the two\nprinciples which had been unanimously accepted are that a State cannot\nplead provisions of its municipal law to escape international responsibility,\nand legislative, judicial as well as executive acts are all capable of giving\nrise to State responsibility.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_17\">13.    He submitted that even when the obligations under a treaty\noverlapped with domestic law (for example the procedure under the internal\ncriminal law, or specific laws enacted as measures to give effect to Treaty\nObligations) and the domestic law involved the actions of National Courts,\nthe action of the Courts themselves could be considered as a violation of the\nTreaty. In support of his submission, he relied upon <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_6\">Articles 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1015123/\" id=\"a_7\">4</a> of the\nResponsibility of States for Internationally Wrongful Acts (ARSIWA)\nwhich are reproduced hereinbelow:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">       <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_8\">Articles 3</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1015123/\" id=\"a_9\">4</a> of ARSIWA\n                              &quot;<a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_10\">Article 3</a>\n        Characterization of an act of a State as internationally\n                               wrongful\n\n      The characterization of an act of a State as internationally\n      wrongful is governed by international law.

An organ includes any person or entity which has that status in\n      accordance with the internal law of the State.‖\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">14.    Mr. Salve submitted that <a href=\"/doc/260256/\" id=\"a_12\">Article 9</a> of the BIPA laid out the procedure\nto be followed in the case of a dispute between an investor of one\nContracting Party (in this case the United Kingdom) and the other\nContracting Party (in this case, the Plaintiff-Union of India). According to\nhim, the dispute resolution procedure was an element of the bilateral treaty,\nand thus any conduct by a State whether by legislation, executive action or\nresort to a National Court which interfered with this process would in itself\nbe a violation of the Treaty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">15.    He pointed out that the BIPA specifically provided for the\nUNCITRAL Arbitration Rules 1976 to apply and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_13\">Article 21</a> incorporated the\nprinciple of kompetenz kompetenz. <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_14\">Article 21</a> reads as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">      ―1.

Mr. Salve also submitted that the Plaintiff-Union of India&#x27;s reliance in\nthe plaint upon the Orascom TMT Investments S.a r.l. v.

He stated that\nthe Award in Orascom infact established that it was the Tribunal that was\nseized of an arbitration that should decide the issue of abuse of process.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">17.    Learned senior counsel for the Defendants stated that the conduct of\nthe Plaintiff-Union of India was also significant in the context of the nature\nof the arbitration. He pointed out that the Plaintiff-Union of India had sought\nrelief on the same ground (i.e. the second arbitration by the present\nDefendants being an abuse of process) from the tribunal constituted under\nthe India-Netherlands BIPA. He pointed out that the Plaintiff-Union of\nIndia had also requested the President of the International Court of Justice\n(hereinafter referred to as &quot;ICJ&quot;) to refrain from taking any action by way of\nappointment of an arbitrator on the ground that the invocation had been an\nabuse of process. Responding to the queries of the President of ICJ on 07th\nAugust 2017, the Plaintiff-Union of India suggested &quot;...an outside date of 31\nAugust 2017 for awaiting the outcome of the application, at which time\nIndia would be prepared to make the appointment if the application has not\nbeen decided...‖. The President of the ICJ, by his letter of 11 th August 2017,\naccepted the request of the Plaintiff-Union of India.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 9 of 81</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\"> 18.    Mr. Salve emphasised that the Plaintiff-Union of India had elected to\nseek relief from the India-Netherlands BIPA tribunal, but without awaiting\nits orders, and without seeking its leave, moved the present Court for the\nsame relief on the same grounds. A conduct such as this, according to him,\ndisentitled the Plaintiff-Union of India, under the principles of Indian\nnational law, to relief by way of an interim injunction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_23\">19.    He also stated that on 01st September, 2017, the President, ICJ\ninformed the Plaintiff-Union of India that, as he was not bound by the order\nof this Court dated 22nd August, 2017, he would proceed with the\nappointment of an arbitrator if the Plaintiff-Union of India failed to appoint\none by 07th September, 2017. On the same date, the Plaintiff-Union of India\nappointed its arbitrator for the arbitration. These facts, according to him,\nestablished not only lack of bona fides, but also that the Plaintiff-Union of\nIndia had obstructed a remedy of dispute resolution which in itself was a\ncontinuation of violation of the BIPA. Mr. Salve prayed that the suit be\ndismissed on the ground of suppression.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_24\">20.    Learned senior counsel for Defendants, without prejudice to the rights\nand contentions of the Defendants, offered that should the Plaintiff-Union of\nIndia bring the challenge of abuse of process before the India-United\nKingdom BIPA Arbitration tribunal, they along with the Claimants in the\nIndia-Netherlands BIPA arbitration would apply to the United Kingdom\nTribunal to consolidate the two arbitrations and with consent of parties both\narbitrations could be conducted before the same tribunal.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                  Page 10 of 81</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\"> SUBMISSIONS OF MR.

Per contra, Mr. Sanjay Jain, learned senior counsel for Plaintiff-Union\nof India submitted that the initiation of arbitration proceeding under the\nIndia-United Kingdom BIPA was an abuse of process because it was aimed\nat avoiding the consequence of the election of remedy under the India-\nNetherlands BIPA and sought to multiply arbitration proceedings to\nmaximise the chances of success for Defendants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_27\">22.    He stated that in April 2012 the Defendants issued a notice of dispute\nto Union of India under the India-Netherlands BIPA. According to him, this\naction amounted to an election of remedy under the India-Netherlands BIPA\nby Defendants and the consequence of such election was that Vodafone\nInternational Holdings B.V. (hereinafter referred to as „VIHBV‟) had to\nlimit its remedy to the one available under the India-Netherlands BIPA. He\nsubmitted that to permit otherwise would be contrary to the principle of\ngood faith and the doctrine of election which were recognized by domestic\nand international law.

Mr. Sanjay Jain pointed out that in June 2015, Defendants had issued\na second notice of dispute to Union of India under the India-United\nKingdom BIPA, but as Union of India had termed the second notice as an\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                  Page 11 of 81</span>\n abuse of process, Defendants had not issued a notice of arbitration to Union\nof India under the India-United Kingdom BIPA for almost eighteen months.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_29\">24.    He stated that in January 2017, Defendants after realising that their\nchances in the arbitration proceedings under the India-Netherlands BIPA\nwere bleak, issued a notice of arbitration to Union of India under the India-\nUnited Kingdom BIPA. He contended that the purpose of the arbitration\nproceedings under the India-United Kingdom BIPA was to provide a second\nchance to Defendants to pursue the same claim before a different tribunal.\nAccording to him, Defendants were always aware of such jurisdictional\nobjection and they merely used such jurisdictional objection to mask their\nreal purpose - to get two chances at pursuing the same claim. He stated that\nto further such purpose, the Defendants not only did not agree to bifurcation\nof the arbitration proceedings under the India-Netherlands BIPA but also\nopposed the application dated 22nd December, 2017 by Union of India to the\ntribunal under the India-Netherlands BIPA for an early determination of the\njurisdictional objection.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">25.    Learned senior counsel for Plaintiff-Union of India pointed out that\nthe UK entities and the Netherlands entity were in the same vertical\ncorporate chain (all under the control of the Vodafone Group) and they\ncomplained of the same measures and the disputes notified to India as well\nas relief sought were identical in both the arbitrations. According to him,\nthis was a clear abuse of process. In support of his contention, he relied upon\nthe following:-\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                  Page 12 of 81</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\"> (A)        Article on Abuse of Process in International Arbitration by Prof.\nEmmanuel Gaillard1 delivered at The Paris Court of Appeal as the\nopening lecture of the 2015 Session of Arbitration Academy, wherein he\nstates, &quot;a claimant will commit an abuse of process when it initiates more\nthan one proceeding to resolve the same or related dispute in order to\nmaximize its chances of success&quot; and that &quot;This strategy is highly prejudicial\nto a respondent, who is forced to defend multiple sets of claims before\ndifferent arbitral tribunals rather than in a single arbitration.&quot;\n(B)        Award in Orascom case (supra), wherein it was held, &quot;....an investor\nwho controls several entities in a vertical chain of companies may commit\nan abuse if it seeks to impugn the same host state measures and claims for\nthe same harm at various levels of the chain in reliance on several\ninvestment treaties concluded by the host state.....does not mean that the\nhost state has accepted to be sued multiple times by various entities under\nthe same control that are part of the vertical chain in relation to the same\ninvestment, the same measures and the same harm....Where multiple treaties\noffer entities in a vertical chain similar procedural rights of access to an\narbitral forum and comparable substantive guarantees, the initiation of\nmultiple proceedings to recover for essentially the same economic harm\nwould entail the exercise of rights for purposes that are alien to those for\nwhich these rights were established.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_31\">26.        Mr. Sanjay Jain submitted that the jurisdictional objection raised by\nPlaintiff-Union of India related to the admissibility / maintainability of\nspecific claims under the India-Netherlands BIPA and such an objection was\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">1</span>\n    Professor of Law, Sciences Po Law School, Paris, France; Visiting Professor, Yale Law School.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                                          Page 13 of 81</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\"> not a technical objection but in fact related to the substantive rights/scope of\ninvestor protection provided by the India-Netherlands BIPA. He stated that\nby commencing arbitration proceedings under the India-United Kingdom\nBIPA, Vodafone was not seeking to overcome a simple defect in\njurisdiction, but was attempting to use the arbitration proceedings under the\nIndia-United Kingdom BIPA to get a second chance at pursuing the same\nclaim in spite of a serious jurisdictional defect. This, according to him, was\na case of ‗textbook treaty shopping&#x27; and should not be permitted.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_33\">27.    Learned senior counsel for Plaintiff-Union of India submitted that the\nargument that Defendants should still be permitted to pursue arbitration\nproceedings under the India-United Kingdom BIPA as a ‗failsafe&#x27; was\nflawed as there was no basis to assume that Defendants were entitled to\npursue additional arbitration proceedings if they were to lose the arbitration\nproceeding under the India-Netherlands BIPA, due to a jurisdictional\nobjection. He contended that if Defendants had elected to pursue a remedy\nunder a specific treaty, then they must be held to proper consequence of\nsuch election and if Defendants were to lose the arbitration proceedings\nunder the India-Netherlands BIPA on a jurisdictional objection or otherwise,\nthen such an outcome should be the end of the matter. He contended that if\nDefendants were not restrained through an appropriate injunction, Union of\nIndia may face further arbitration proceedings under other investment\ntreaties without any end in sight.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_34\">28.    Learned senior counsel for Plaintiff-Union of India further submitted\nthat commencement of any other arbitration proceedings under the India-\nUnited Kingdom BIPA was unnecessary and pre-mature at this stage.\nAccording to him, this Court should not ‗second guess&#x27; the outcome of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 14 of 81</span>\n arbitration proceedings under the India-Netherlands BIPA and conjecture as\nto the need for a ‗failsafe&#x27; at present. He pointed out that it is entirely\npossible for Defendants to be heard on merits in India- Netherlands BIPA\narbitration proceedings and if that were to happen, it would obviate the need\nfor arbitration proceedings under the India-United Kingdom BIPA.\nConsequently, according to learned senior counsel for Plaintiff-Union of\nIndia, the obvious and prudent route for both parties would be to conclude\nthe arbitration proceedings under the India-Netherlands BIPA and then\ndecide if further arbitration proceeding under a separate treaty was required\nat all.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">29.       Mr. Sanjay Jain stated that consolidation of arbitration proceedings\nwould only legitimise an inherent abuse of process on the part of Defendants\nand would not provide any succour to Union of India since there would\nremain two claims under two different treaties and Union of India would\nstill have to defend two claims on merits by filing separate pleadings and\nadvancing separate arguments.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">30.       He further submitted that there would be no finality attached to even\nthe consolidated arbitration proceedings as Defendants could exploit their\ncorporate structure to ignite a third treaty claim. He emphasised that this\nCourt, being a court of equity and good conscience, should not permit\nDefendants to take advantage of their own wrong by first electing to pursue\nremedies under the India-Netherlands BIPA, and then igniting further\narbitration proceedings under the India-United Kingdom BIPA on the\napprehension of losing the legal battle in the first arbitration proceedings. He\nstated that there was no seamless merger possible between the two\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 15 of 81</span>\n arbitration proceedings, and hence he repudiated the proposal to consolidate\nthe two arbitration proceedings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"176899444\" id=\"span_17\">31.    Learned senior counsel for Plaintiff-Union of India prayed that this\nCourt should exercise its inherent jurisdiction to prevent abuse of process\nand grant an anti-arbitration injunction restraining Defendants from\ncontinuing with the arbitration proceedings as was done by Calcutta High\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/176899444/\" id=\"a_15\">The Board of Trustees of the Port of Kolkata v. Louis Dreyfus\nArmatures SAS &amp; Ors.</a>, 2014 SCC OnLine Cal 17695.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">32.    Learned senior counsel for Plaintiff-Union of India submitted that a\nNational Court is required to exercise its jurisdiction in accordance with\napplicable domestic laws. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"48872488\" id=\"span_18\">In support of his submission, he relied upon the\nSupreme Court judgment in <a href=\"/doc/48872488/\" id=\"a_16\">World Sport Group (Mauritius) Limited Vs.\nMSM Satellite (Singapore) Pte Limited</a>, (2014) 11 SCC 639 wherein it has\nbeen held as follows:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">      &quot;22. We are unable to accept the first contention of Mr\n      Venugopal that as Clause 9 of the Facilitation Deed provides\n      that any party may seek equitable relief in a court of competent\n      jurisdiction in Singapore, or such other court that may have\n      jurisdiction over the parties, the Bombay High Court had no\n      jurisdiction to entertain the suit and restrain the arbitration\n      proceedings at Singapore because of the principle of comity of\n      courts......\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">      23. In the present case no decision of a court of foreign country\n      or no law of a foreign country has been cited on behalf of the\n      appellant to contend that the courts in India out of deference to\n      such decision of the foreign court or foreign law must not assume\n      jurisdiction to restrain arbitration proceedings at Singapore. On\n      the other hand, as has been rightly submitted by Mr\n      Subramanium, under <a href=\"/doc/76869205/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 9</a> CPC, the courts in India have\n      jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature excepting suits of\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                  Page 16 of 81</span>\n       which cognizance is either expressly or impliedly barred. Thus,\n      the appropriate civil court in India has jurisdiction to entertain\n      the suit and pass appropriate orders in the suit by virtue of\n      <a href=\"/doc/76869205/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 9</a> CPC and Clause 9 of the Facilitation Deed providing\n      that the courts in Singapore or any other court having\n      jurisdiction over the parties can be approached for equitable\n      relief could not oust the jurisdiction of the appropriate civil court\n      conferred by <a href=\"/doc/76869205/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 9</a> CPC......&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"92712826\" id=\"span_20\">33.    Mr. Sanjay Jain contended that as this Court has the jurisdiction under\nIndian law to prevent abuse of process, it cannot limit its jurisdiction or\nrefuse to exercise its jurisdiction. He submitted that <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_20\">Article 21</a> of the\nUNCITRAL Rules did not stipulate a negative formulation of the kompetenz\nkompetenz principle that precluded a competent court (such as this Court)\nfrom exercising its jurisdiction to prevent abuse of process. He submitted\nthat the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/92712826/\" id=\"a_21\">Chloro Controls India Private Limited Vs.\nSevern Trent Water Purification Inc. &amp; Others</a>, (2013) 1 SCC 641 has\nrejected the concept of negative kompetenz kompetenz in the following\nterms:-</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1085356\" id=\"span_21\">―85. This is the position of law in France and in some other\n      countries, but as far as the Indian law is concerned, <a href=\"/doc/140184343/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 45</a> is\n      a legislative mandate and does not admit of any ambiguity. We\n      must take note of the aspect of Indian law that Chapter I of Part II\n      of the 1996 Act does not contain any provision analogous to\n      <a href=\"/doc/146900308/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 8(3)</a> under Part I of the Act. In other words, under the\n      Indian law, greater obligation is cast upon the courts to determine\n      whether the agreement is valid, operative and capable of being\n      performed at the threshold itself. Such challenge has to be a\n      serious challenge to the substantive contract or to the agreement,\n      as in the absence of such challenge, it has to be found that the\n      agreement was valid, operative and capable of being performed;\n      the dispute would be referred to arbitration.

The above remarks of the Board indicate that even a decree\n      which is pronounced in absentem by a foreign court is valid and\n      executable in the country of the forum by which it was\n      pronounced when authorised by special local legislation. A\n      decree passed by a foreign court to whose jurisdiction a\n      judgment-debtor had not submitted is an absolute nullity only if\n      the local Legislature had not conferred jurisdiction on the\n      domestic courts over the foreigners either generally or under\n      specified circumstances. <a href=\"/doc/1009821/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 20(c)</a> of ‗the Code&#x27; confers\n      jurisdiction on a court in India over the foreigners if the cause of\n      action arises within the jurisdiction of that court.....The board\n      itself had noticed that this rule of Private International Law is\n      subject to special local legislation.

Hence it must be held that the suit\n      in question was a properly instituted suit.

Mr. Sumeet Kachwaha, the learned Amicus Curiae submitted that the\nagreement to arbitrate as mentioned in the investment treaty was like making\na contract from an advertisement and such an advertisement constituted a\nbinding unilateral invitation to invite offers that could be accepted by\nanyone who performed its terms. Consequently, according to the learned\nAmicus Curiae the provisions in the bilateral investment treaty had given\nrise to the formation of a contract along the lines of reasoning adopted in\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                 Page 20 of 81</span>\n Carlill v.

In support of his submission, he relied upon the judgment of the\nCaribbean Court of Justice, Appellate Jurisdiction in British Caribbean\nBank Limited v. The Attorney General of Belize [2013] CCJ 4 (AJ),\nwherein it has been held, &quot;Thus BCB, the investor, is not a party to the\ntreaty but <a href=\"/doc/691208/\" id=\"a_37\">Article 8</a> makes a free standing offer which is accepted on\nsubmission of the dispute to arbitration and becomes a binding contract\nbetween the investor and the State party. The provision is clear and\nunambiguous. It evidences the intention of the State parties to provide\nprivate investors with the right to have the specified disputes settled by\ninternational arbitration.       The plain wording of the article also\ndemonstrates that there are no preconditions to the right to submit the\ndispute to international arbitration.....&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">44.    Learned Amicus Curiae submitted that it was a part of the inherent\njurisdiction of the court to prevent abuse of process of court. He pointed out\nthat the Caribbean Court of justice in British Caribbean Bank Limited v.\nThe Attorney General of Belize (supra) has held that the concepts of\n„oppression‟, „vexation‟, „inequity‟ and „abuse of process‟ have been known\nto the common law and equity for centuries, being the primary theories used\nby the court to regulate its process pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction. He\nclarified that the enabling provision in the aforesaid case empowering the\ncourts to issue an anti-arbitration injunction (including in relation to offshore\narbitrations) on the ground of the same being oppressive, vexatious,\ninequitable or an abuse of the process, did not make any change in the\ncommon law principles applicable prior to its passage.           Consequently,\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                    Page 21 of 81</span>\n according to him, the court has inherent jurisdiction to restrain BIT\nArbitrations which are oppressive, vexatious and / or an abuse of process of\nlaw.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_52\">45.     But, Mr. Sumeet Kachwaha, contended that the reason for Defendants\ncommencing the arbitration proceedings under the India-United Kingdom\nBIPA was the jurisdictional objection raised by Plaintiff-Union of India in\nthe arbitration proceedings under the India-Netherlands BIPA in January\n2017. He stated that the proceeding under the India-United Kingdom BIPA\nhad been initiated by the Defendants as a direct consequence of Union of\nIndia&#x27;s position in India-Netherlands BIPA Arbitration that the said Tribunal\nlacked jurisdiction to decide tax issues.   He drew this Court&#x27;s attention to\nthe following paragraph in the Notice of Arbitration issued by the\nDefendants under the India-United Kingdom BIPA:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">       &quot;5.     The Claimants and Claimants&#x27; subsidiary are not seeking\n       double recovery by way of the two claims which are being\n       brought. Indeed, at present, they only seek damages as an\n       alternative remedy - the Claimants&#x27; primary requests for relief\n       are merely for declaratory and injunctive relief and an award of\n       their costs. The Respondent has asserted that the Tribunal\n       constituted to determine VIHBV&#x27;s claim under the Netherlands-\n       India Treaty lacks jurisdiction; these proceedings under the UK-\n       India Treaty are a direct consequence of the Respondent&#x27;s\n       position in that arbitration.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_53\">46.     Learned Amicus Curiae contended that Defendants merely sought one\nroute to arbitration and did not seek double recovery and therefore there was\nno abuse of process. He emphasised that the absence of double recovery by\nVodafone excluded the possibility of abuse of process.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                 Page 22 of 81</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\"> 47.    He referred to three letters of Defendants dated 17th May, 2017, 17th\nJune, 2017 and 25th July, 2017 to contend that &quot;even before the suit was\nfiled, the Defendants were always ready and willing and on their own made\nseveral offers for consolidation&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_55\">48.    Mr. Sumeet Kachwaha stated that Plaintiff-Union of India‟s\nsuggestion that both the parties should first finish the arbitration proceedings\nunder the India-Netherlands BIPA and then decide if further arbitration\nproceeding under a separate treaty was required at all was not a ‗prudent\nroute&#x27;. He contended that this solution would probably constitute a greater\nabuse of process as in parallel proceedings there can be at least some\ncoordination between the two tribunals (say for instance for recording of\nevidence; selection of seat etc.), whereas in sequential arbitration, the second\ntribunal would neither be like an appellate forum nor would it be bound by\nthe first award. Both the awards were likely to be challenged (perhaps in\ndifferent forums) as well as parties would be able to approbate and reprobate\nat the same time and it would unfairly delay the judicial process for the\nclaimants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_56\">49.    The learned Amicus Curiae submitted that BIPA arbitrations have\nresulted in emergence of an international administrative law that regulates\nthe conduct of States through a private adjudicative mechanism.               He\nemphasised that the BIPA arbitrators are a fairly small and select group of\nspecialised professionals from United States of America and Europe with\nexperience in commercial law rather than in policy making. In support of\nhis contention, he referred to the following parts of the speech of Mr. Justice\nSundaresh Menon, Chief Justice of Singapore on International Arbitration:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 23 of 81</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\"> The Coming of New Age for Asia (and Elsewhere) delivered at ICCA\nCongress 2012:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">       &quot;18. Investment treaties were designed to encourage foreign\n       direct investment by providing an additional safeguard of a\n       foreign investor&#x27;s commercial interests and protecting this from\n       being adversely affected by government action in the host State.\n       What was contemplated, at least initially, was unlawful taking by\n       expropriation or damage through unfair and inequitable\n       treatment. In signing these treaties, the State typically gives its\n       broad and advance consent for arbitration to be deployed as a\n       mechanism to resolve individual claims from a potentially\n       indeterminate class of investors and this holds good for a\n       significant length of time.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">       19. But more than just a procedural mechanism for resolving\n       investment disputes, investment treaty arbitration has come to set\n       standards against which the exercise of public authority by the\n       contracting States are going to be reviewed. In that sense, it\n       mirrors the role of administrative law in reviewing governmental\n       action in the domestic context - hence the suggestion made\n       elsewhere that what we are witnessing is the emergence of an\n       international administrative law that regulates the conduct of\n       States through a private adjudicative mechanism.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">       20. This is exciting at several levels. But it also gives cause\n       for concern. While those practising in this field have a general\n       understanding that &quot;indirect expropriation&quot; refers to any\n       Government measure that has the effect of eroding the value of\n       an investment, it is probably not settled whether legislative or\n       policy changes, which have a legitimate public interest purpose,\n       will also be caught by the principle.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">                    xxx                xxx                 xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">       22. The arbitrators, men and women often schooled and\n       experienced in commercial law, find themselves having an\n       unexpectedly weighty hand in shaping economic and monetary\n       policy, tax incentives and perhaps even employment laws. From\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                  Page 24 of 81</span>\n        the perspective of the government, national policy and\n       legislation will now have to be assessed for legality vis-a-vis the\n       State&#x27;s international treaty obligations, as interpreted by an\n       autonomous, privately funded adjudicative body usually\n       consisting of foreign nationals. This has the potential to\n       constrain the exercise of domestic public authority in a manner\n       and to a degree perhaps not seen since the colonial era.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">                     xxx                  xxx                  xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">       32. But who are the arbitrators to whom such important tasks\n       have been entrusted? They tend mainly to come from a fairly\n       small and select group of specialised and arbitrators principally\n       from Europe and the United States with experience in\n       commercial law rather than in policy making. They are often\n       unlikely to be attuned to the nuances of domestic public interest\n       of the countries affected by their awards. This private model of\n       international adjudication has allowed a select few individuals\n       drawn from narrow specialities within international and\n       commercial law to rule on issues of public policy and legality of\n       state regulatory actions, with little or no accountability to the\n       constituency. Such an adjudicative mechanism bypasses the\n       traditional protections and the often delicate and carefully\n       arranged balance of interests that are built into the domestic\n       administrative law framework.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">                     xxx                  xxx                  xxx\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">       39. Specifically as regards investment treaty arbitration, there\n       have been assertions either of a perceived pro-investor bias on\n       the part of commercial arbitrators or perhaps less frequently, a\n       pro-state bias on the part of some public international lawyers\n       active in this field. In relation to the former, it is, after all, in the\n       interest of the entrepreneurial arbitrator to rule expansively on\n       his own jurisdiction and then in favour of the investor on the\n       merits, because this increases the prospect of future claims and is\n       thereby business-generating. This hints of a modern-day uber-\n       sophisticated ambulance-chasing plaintiffs&#x27; lawyer. The pro-\n       investor attitude has even been cited as the reason arbitrators\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                        Page 25 of 81</span>\n        from the developing world often rule in favour of investors from\n       traditionally capital-exporting countries, this being the &quot;price&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">       that has to be paid to gain credibility and access to the privileged\n       club of elite international arbitrators.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">       40. Unbridled criticisms of how arbitrators are invariably\n       profit-driven and biased, or that they always act strategically so\n       as to be repeat players, are undoubtedly overstated. However, it\n       is undeniable that the typical conditions that assure impartiality\n       in the judicial sphere are lacking in arbitration. Whereas judges\n       are segregated from the rest of the legal professional community,\n       arbitrators are largely drawn from precisely the same pool of\n       professionals. The &quot;usual suspects&quot; in the industry may be\n       arbitrator in one case and lawyer in the very next, often trading\n       places in the process with another in the same select group. And\n       while forum shopping is frowned upon in the judicial context,\n       parties actively seek out arbitrators whom they believe would be\n       pre-disposed to rule in their favour. The self-correcting\n       mechanism of disclosure of interest is also open to criticism\n       because of the inherent &quot;conflict within a conflict&quot; problem.\n       Because disclosure depends on self-diagnosis, the decision to\n       make such a disclosure may itself be against the self-interest of\n       the arbitrator, if it were likely to result in foregoing a substantial\n       fee.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">                     xxx                  xxx                 xxx\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_60\">       77. Fourth, we should examine the normative justification for\n       arbitration providing a form of governance through its providing\n       the platform for the emergence of substantive legal norms that\n       govern states. In the field of investment arbitration, it might\n       perhaps be justified on the basis that exposing States to such\n       liability promotes transparency and accountability, as well as the\n       enhanced protection of individual rights. But there is a need for\n       a serious debate to take place as to whether the concepts of\n       expropriation and fair and equitable treatment, which is what the\n       treaties set out to protect in the first place, should extend as far\n       as they now do. If we were all convinced that this global\n       administrative law is fundamentally beneficial, then the next step\n       would be to develop a rich jurisprudence to add flesh and texture\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                     Page 26 of 81</span>\n        to various aspects of the law. The principles of good governance,\n       fair and equitable treatment and respect for individual investor\n       rights need to be more clearly rationalised and articulated. This\n       cannot be the sole province of a small group of arbitrators.\n       Thought leaders from government agencies, practitioners and the\n       academic community must engage in an on-going dialogue to\n       generate an overarching set of legal norms that will govern\n       treaty interpretation.&quot;\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_61\">RESPONSE OF UNION OF INDIA TO ARGUMENTS ADVANCED BY\nAMICUS CURIAE\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">50.    In response to the arguments advanced by the learned Amicus Curiae,\nMr. Sanjay Jain, learned senior counsel for Plaintiff-Union of India denied\nthat Defendants had commenced proceedings under the India-United\nKingdom BIPA in response to a jurisdictional objection raised by Union of\nIndia in January, 2017. He pointed out that Defendants were aware of such\njurisdictional objection as far back as May, 2012.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_63\">51.      He submitted that the assumption that Defendants were somehow\nentitled to a decision on merits of their case-notwithstanding the election of\nremedies under the specific BIPA by Vodafone was untenable in law. He\nsubmitted that if Defendants had elected to pursue the remedies under a\nspecific treaty, then they must be held to the proper consequence of such\nelection. According to him, to permit otherwise would be contrary to\nprinciples of good faith and doctrine of election which were recognized by\ndomestic and international law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_64\">52.    Mr. Sanjay Jain stated that the learned Amicus Curiae&#x27;s reliance on\nthe decision in British Caribbean Bank Limited (supra) to contend that\ncommencement of parallel proceedings was not per se vexatious, failed to\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                  Page 27 of 81</span>\n consider that in the said case there were parallel proceedings before the\nNational Courts under Municipal Laws and before an arbitral tribunal under\nan investment treaty. He pointed out that in the British Caribbean Bank\nLimited (supra) the relevant investment treaty did not contain an exhaustion\nof local remedies requirement and thereby contemplated parallel\nproceedings to such an extent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_65\">53.    Mr. Sanjay Jain stated that the Defendants‟ letters dated 17th May,\n2017, 17th June, 2017 and 25th June, 2017 did not support the contention that\nVodafone had made an offer to consolidate arbitration proceedings. He\nstated that on the contrary these letters proved Defendants‟ intention to\nunfairly maximise its chances of success by multiplying proceedings and by\nreiterating its indefensible demand that India should withdraw its\njurisdictional objection in the arbitration proceedings under the India-\nNetherland BIPA or face multiple proceedings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_66\">54.    Learned senior counsel for Plaintiff-Union of India reiterated that\nconsolidation of arbitration proceedings would not prevent abuse of process,\nbut would simply mask such abuse to the advantage of Defendants. He\nsubmitted that Union of India had not consented to defending multiple\nclaims relating to same cause of action--whether before one tribunal or\nmultiple tribunals. According to him, consolidation of arbitration\nproceedings would ensure that arbitration proceedings under the India-\nUnited Kingdom BIPA could be used to pursue the same claims relating to\nthe same cause of action pertaining to the same economic harm.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_67\">55.    Mr. Sanjay Jain stated that there was no contradiction between the\npositions taken by the Plaintiff-Union of India in the arbitration proceedings\nunder the India-Netherlands BIPA and before this Court.

In rejoinder, Mr. Harish Salve submitted that <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_38\">the CPC</a> did not create\njurisdiction of a domestic Court. According to him, in disputes where the\nDefendant was a resident outside India, the jurisdiction of an Indian Court\nwould have to be established under principles of private international law.\nHe submitted that the relief of an injunction was an action in personam and\nunder the well established rule of private international law all personal\nactions had to be filed in the Courts of the country where the Defendant\nresided. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1508646\" id=\"span_38\">In support of his submission, Mr. Salve relied upon the judgment of\nthe Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1508646/\" id=\"a_39\">The Andhra Bank Ltd.

Learned senior counsel for Defendants emphasised that the Courts of\nIndia are a part of the constitutional architecture of the Republic of India and\nit is for this reason that the action of the Courts are attributable to the State.\nAccording to him, no organ of the State could act in a manner that would\ndeny a foreign investor the right to invoke the remedy by way of arbitration,\nwhich remedy in itself was a right under the treaty. He submitted that the\nRepublic of India - the respondent in the arbitration that would commence -\ncould not act in its own interest and „injunct‟ a potential Claimant from\nbringing a claim.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_72\">59.    He further submitted that a National Court could not interdict the\ninvocation of treaty arbitration - for that would constitute preventing a\nnational of a foreign state from invoking the provisions of a treaty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_73\">60.    Mr. Harish Salve lastly submitted that the decisions relied upon by the\nlearned Amicus Curiae were cases where the Courts had exercised\njurisdiction based on the curial law of the arbitration agreement.              He\nsubmitted that once the tribunal was constituted, the Courts of the seat of the\ntribunal would have competence to decide the issue of jurisdiction.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                     Page 30 of 81</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_74\">                                        FACTS\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_75\">61.

According to United Nations Conference on Trade and Development\n[UNCTAD], the number of BIPAs increased from 385 at the end of the\n1980s to a total of 2,926 by the end of 2014. Further, by the end of 2014,\nthe number of known treaty-based investor - State cases had reached 608--\napproximately ten times the figure as it stood at 2000.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_114\">63.    As the number of investment treaty arbitrations have grown, concerns\nover the investment treaty system have arisen. These concerns include a\nperceived deficit of legitimacy given that States are being judged on their\nconduct by private non-elected individuals. Concerns have also arisen in\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                      Page 43 of 81</span>\n respect of inconsistent arbitral awards, the independence and impartiality of\narbitrators, and the delays and costs of arbitral procedures. These concerns\nhave resonated in some scholarly publications.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_115\">64.    Commenting on Growth in Investment Treaty Arbitration, Mr. Justice\nSundaresh Menon, Chief Justice of Singapore in his speech on International\nArbitration: The Coming of New Age for Asia (and Elsewhere) (supra) stated\nas under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"156242701\" id=\"span_54\">&quot;14.     This is a comparatively recent phenomenon, and its most\n      significant impact has been that national governments have\n      increasingly found their freedom to act in their own domestic\n      space being curtailed by the interpretations placed by arbitral\n      tribunals on investment treaties. These treaties would often have\n      been entered into at a time when States never expected to\n      encounter such a flood of treaty based claims nor the sorts of\n      interpretations being place upon these treaties. Striking examples\n      of this include recent claims brought by tobacco companies\n      against countries such as Australia and Uruguay in relation to the\n      alleged indirect expropriation of intellectual property rights said\n      to arise out of plain packaging legislation. Yet more recently, in\n      <a href=\"/doc/156242701/\" id=\"a_44\">While Industries Vs. India</a>, a tribunal seated in Singapore held that\n      pursuant to the MFN clause that was found in India&#x27;s BIT with\n      Australia, the Australian investor could take advantage of an\n      &quot;effective means of enforcement&quot; obligation found in India&#x27;s BIT\n      with Kuwait and on that basis held India liable for failing to\n      provide an effective means for the investor to enforce a\n      commercial arbitration award it had obtained some ten years\n      earlier against its local partner, an Indian state-owned enterprise.</span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">      15.     This development has a real economic impact on the\n      States. By way of illustration, after Argentina&#x27;s economic collapse\n      in 2001, the Government decided to allow the peso to decline in\n      value against the dollar. By 2004, the peso stabilised and the\n      economy began to recover. But as a result of this decision, claims\n      were brought against Argentina founded on the investment treaties\n      it had concluded in the 1990s. By 2006, more than 30 claims were\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                  Page 44 of 81</span>\n      pending for a staggering estimated sum of $17 billion in claimed\n     compensation, an amount equivalent to the entire annual budget of\n     the national government.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">     16.      Similarly, in 2001, a tribunal constituted in Sweden\n     ordered the Czech Republic to pay amounts totalling\n     approximately USD 353 million to a Dutch company, owned by an\n     American, that had invested in a TV broadcasting business. The\n     tribunal found that the broadcast licensing regime and media\n     policies of the Czech Government&#x27;s Media Council, which\n     eventually prompted the Dutch company to divest itself of a TV\n     station, had violated the country&#x27;s bilateral investment treaty with\n     the Netherlands. The amount of damages ordered was roughly\n     equivalent to the country&#x27;s entire health care budget. These cases\n     illustrate that an entirely new source of state accountability and\n     liability has emerged. The potential size and impact of such\n     awards mean that government agencies just cannot afford to\n     ignore the seemingly expansive treaty obligations they have\n     undertaken.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">                  xxx           xxx                xxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">     33.     The broad and open-textured way in which treaty\n     commitments are defined, coupled with the length of time over\n     which they are expected to operate without any supervision or\n     control by electoral mechanisms, mean that the discretion vested in\n     private arbitrators to interpret these rules is likely to have a\n     considerable impact on States. This shift of power from the States\n     to the arbitral tribunals, has resulted in jurisprudence that has\n     been colourfully described as &quot;a house of cards built largely by\n     reference to other tribunal awards and academic opinions&quot;,\n     &quot;unconstrained by the discipline of the treaty parties&#x27; practice of\n     expectations&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_116\">     34.     This evolving body of substantive investment arbitration\n     law also suffers from a lack of coherence and consistency because\n     its development has been piecemeal. With no central organising\n     structure or unifying appellate control and no doctrine of binding\n     precedent, the results are often conflicting. Any attempt by the\n     courts to provide oversight is fragmentary and restricted:\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                 Page 45 of 81</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">       fragmented because enforcement of awards can be sought before\n      the courts of any of the many signatories to the New York\n      Convention, and restricted because of the principle of minimal\n      curial intervention.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">                                                 (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">65.

Even the ‗jurisdiction&#x27; in the international sense i.e. under private\ninternational law has been viewed from the point of view of internal\ncompetency of the Court and also competency in the eyes of international\nlaw by Justice M. Hidayatullah (as he then was) of the Indian Supreme\nCourt in <a href=\"/doc/909807/\" id=\"a_49\">R.

What is\n      meant by competency can be looked at from two points of view.\n      There is the internal competency of a court depending upon the\n      procedural rules of the law applicable to that court in the State to\n      which it belongs. There is also its competency in the eye of\n      international law. The competency in the international sense\n      means jurisdiction over the subject-matter of the controversy and\n      jurisdiction over the parties as recognised by rules of\n      international law. What is meant by competency in this context\n      was stated by Balckburn, J., speaking for the Judges in answer to\n      the    question    referred    by    the    House      of     Lords\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                    Page 48 of 81</span>\n      in Castrique v. Imrie [(1870) LR 4 HL 414]. Relying upon\n     Story&#x27;s Conflict of Laws, the learned Judge observed:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">         ―We may observe that the words as to an action being in rem\n         or in personam, and the common statement that the one is\n         binding on third persona and the other not, are apt to be used\n         by English lawyers without attaching any very definite\n         meaning to those phrases. We apprehend the true principle to\n         be that indicated in the last few words quoted from Story. We\n         think the enquiry is, first, whether the subject-matter was so\n         situated as to be within the lawful control of the State under\n         the authority of which the Court sits; and secondly, whether\n         the sovereign authority of that State has conferred on the\n         Court jurisdiction to decide as to the disposition of the thing,\n         and the Court has acted within its jurisdiction. If these\n         conditions are fulfilled, the adjudication is conclusive against\n         all the world.‖\n     Story&#x27;s exact words are to be found in para 586 of his book, and\n     this is what the learned author said:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">          ―In order however to found a proper ground of recognition\n          of any foreign judgment in another country, it is\n          indispensable to establish that the court pronouncing\n          judgment should have a lawful jurisdiction over the cause,\n          over the thing, and over the parties. If the jurisdiction fails as\n          to either it is ... treated as a mere nullity, having no\n          obligation, and entitled to no respect beyond the domestic\n          tribunals. And this equally true, whether the proceedings lie\n          in rem or in personam or in rem and also in personam.‖\n     The opinion expressed by Story here is, in its turn, based on that\n     of Boullenois in his Traite et de la Personnalite et de la Realite\n     des Lois Coutumes ou Status, (1766) Vol. I, pp. 618-620.\n     The law stated by Blackburn, J., has been universally accepted by\n     all the Courts in the English speaking countries and it was\n     quoted with approval recently by the Privy Council\n     in Ingenohl v.

Concurring on this point, the majority (per Justice J.C. Shah and\nJustice S.K.

The\nDefendants have further claimed that they themselves and their\n―subsidiaries‖ have continued to invest extensively in the development ―of\ntheir telecommunication network in India‖ through Vodafone India Limited\nand the said capital investments in India exceeded US$17 billion and the\nDefendants have added 169 million subscribers since 2007 and now directly\nemploy 19,471 people in India.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_126\">72.    While this remains a matter for the arbitral tribunal to rule upon, for\nthe present purposes, as the Defendants have not rejoined on these\nassertions, this Court proceeds on the basis of the statement made by the\nDefendant before the arbitral tribunal.        In fact, from the aforesaid\nstatements, this Court is of the view that the cause of action for the present\nsuit partly arose within the jurisdiction of this Court and Defendants had\npurposefully availed of Indian jurisdiction, inter alia, by making an\ninvestment in India, holding economic interests in India and carrying on\nbusiness in India and from a reasonable and holistic perspective, Defendants\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                  Page 50 of 81</span>\n have to be considered as working for gain within the jurisdiction of this\nCourt.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_127\">73.      Moreover, even if it is taken that a corporation that is incorporated\nunder the laws of another state would, under the established principles of\ninternational law, have its rights and obligations governed by the domestic\nlaw of the state of its incorporation, then also the test of residence would be\nsatisfied by applying the principles of &quot;single economic entity&quot;-           which\nprinciple is applicable even under the English law. This Court in Pankaj\nAluminium Industries Pvt. Ltd. Vs. M/s. Bharat Aluminium Company\nLtd., 2011 IV AD (Delhi) 212 after relying upon DHN Food Distributors\nLtd. and Others v. London Borough of Tower Hamlets [1976] 3 All ER\n462 at Page 467 has recognised the doctrine of single economic entity. In\nDHN Food Distributors Ltd. (supra), it has been held as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">         ―.....We all know that in many respects a group of companies\n         are treated together for the purpose of general accounts,\n         balance sheet and profit and loss account. They are treated as\n         one concern. Professor Gower in his book on company law\n         says : ‗there is evidence of a general tendency to ignore the\n         separate legal entities of various companies within a group,\n         and to look instead at the economic entity of the whole group&#x27;.\n         This is especially the case when a parent company owns all the\n         shares of the subsidiaries, so much so that it can control every\n         movement of the subsidiaries. These subsidiaries are bound\n         hand and foot to the parent company and must do just what the\n         parent company says. A striking instance is the decision of the\n         House of Lords in Harold Holdworth &amp; Co. (Wakefield) Ltd. v.\n         Caddies. So here. This group is virtually the same as a\n         partnership in which all the three companies are partners.\n         They should not be treated separately so as to be defeated on a\n         technical point.      They should not be deprived of the\n         compensation which should justly be payable for disturbance.\n         The three companies should, for present purposes, be treated as\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_64\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 51 of 81</span>\n        one, and the parent company, DHN, should be treated as that\n       one.

It is settled law that the jurisdiction of the Civil Courts in India is all\nembracing except to the extent it is excluded by an explicit provision of law\nor by clear intendment arising from such law.

Though <a href=\"/doc/741672/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 253</a> of the Constitution empowers the Indian\nParliament to make a law to give effect to International Treaties, yet the\nParliament has not passed any specific legislation to give effect to BIPA\nAgreements. However, there is no statutory bar or case law relating to treaty\nobligation which creates an ouster of jurisdiction or threshold bar for Indian\ncourts in relation to a bilateral investment treaty arbitration. Accordingly,\nthere is no explicit or implicit ouster of jurisdiction of National Courts.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\">78.    Further, India has not acceded to the position that in matters of\nbilateral investment treaty arbitrations, there is an ouster of jurisdiction of\nNational Courts as is apparent from Union of India&#x27;s refusal to accede to the\nfive decades old &#x27;Convention on the Settlement of Investment Disputes\nbetween States And Nationals of Other States, 1965. This Convention sets\nup an International Centre for Settlement of Investment Disputes (for short\n&quot;ICSID&quot;). About 161 States have signed the ICSID Convention and 153\nhave ratified it till date. However, Union of India has not signed it and the\nmain reason seems to be that the ICSID Convention completely negates the\nrole of National Courts. Consequently, there is no threshold bar insofar as\nthe dispute is concerned.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_133\">79.    Even if, one were to examine this issue dehors <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_53\">the Code of Civil\nProcedure</a>, this Court is of the view that the India-United Kingdom BIPA\nholds out to investors on a standing basis the right to choose to submit the\ndisputes for settlement by binding arbitration. The said treaty expressly\nprovides the consent of the Indian State to submit any investment dispute for\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_68\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                    Page 53 of 81</span>\n settlement by binding arbitration.

However, there is a distinction between an Inter-State arbitration and\nan Investor-State arbitration. Investors like the Defendants are not enforcing\nrights given to the United Kingdom, but are pursuing the rights in their name\nand for themselves claims against the other State party.

In the present BIPA\nArbitration, a contractual obligation and a contractual right is involved and\ntherefore, there is no bar as to the subject matter of the dispute or as to the\njurisdiction of the court to hear the present case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_143\">84.    The argument with regard to non-justiciablity of unincorporated\ntreaties in the context of a private investor and host State has not been\naccepted by even the Courts in the United Kingdom. In Republic of\nEcuador v Occidental Exploration and Production Co [2005] EWCA Civ\n1116, the Republic of Ecuador brought a claim under <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_58\">Sections 67</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_59\">68</a> of\nthe Arbitration Act 1996 of England and Wales seeking to set aside the\naward of an arbitral tribunal dated 01st July, 2004 given largely in favour of\nthe Defendants, Occidental Exploration and Production Company, a\nCalifornian corporation. The dispute arose in relation to an investment\nagreement between the parties entered into pursuant to a bilateral investment\ntreaty between the Republic of Ecuador and the United States of America.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_71\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                    Page 56 of 81</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_144\"> The arbitration was provided for by the terms of the treaty and Occidental\nraised a preliminary objection that any challenge to the award would involve\nan interpretation of an unincorporated treaty which made the claim non-\njusticiable by an English court. Justice Aikens on 29 April, 2005 ([2005]\nEWHC 774 (Comm), [2005] 2 Lloyd&#x27;s Re 242) found in favour of the\nRepublic of Ecuador on the objection and Occidental appealed. The Court of\nAppeal in the said case after considering the judgments cited by Mr. Salve\nincluding the Tin Council Case (supra), Re Barcelona Traction, Light and\nPower Co. Ltd., (Belgium v Spain) (supra), LaGrand (Germany v. United\nStates) (supra), Buttes Gas and Oil Co. v Hammer (Nos.2 and 3) (supra),\nCampaign for Nuclear Disarmament (supra), rejected the argument that the\nCourts have no jurisdiction to interpret or apply unincorporated International\ntreaties between an investor and a host State.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_145\">85.    The decision of Société Générale de Surveillance SA v Islamic\nRepublic of Pakistan also does not offer any assistance to the Defendants as\nit is a decision not of a Court, but of an ICSID arbitral tribunal to which the\nState had on any view agreed. This Court is of the opinion that an arbitral\ntribunal award passed by an Investment Treaty Tribunal does not carry the\nstatus of a precedent. There are several instances of an arbitral tribunal not\nconsidering itself bound by an award passed by another investment tribunal.\nConsequently, there is no reason for the National Courts to accord them the\nstatus of precedent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_146\">86.    Also as stated hereinabove, ICSID Tribunal decision is under auspices\nof ICSID convention, cornerstone of which is to exclude jurisdictions of the\nCourts. India has not acceded to this convention and it does not wish to\ndilute or surrender the National Courts jurisdiction which it may otherwise\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_72\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                  Page 57 of 81</span>\n have. This being India&#x27;s position, it would be fundamentally incorrect to\nembrace the ICSID jurisprudence of non-interventions by Courts, for that\nwould be bringing in by the &#x27;back door&#x27;, when the &#x27;front door&#x27; has been shut!\nIn these circumstances, this Court is of the opinion that it will not accept an\nICSID or Investment award as having precedentary value.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_147\">87.    Further, if the argument of lack of jurisdiction canvassed by learned\nsenior counsel for Defendants is accepted, then this Court would be\npowerless to execute a BIPA award against the State, even if the foreign\ninvestor were to approach this Court for its enforcement and execution!\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_148\">88.    Consequently, this Court does not agree with the submission that the\nNational Court has no jurisdiction or should refrain from exercising its\njurisdiction with regard to BIPA Arbitrations. However, this Court is of the\nview that recourse to a Court, when and if permissible, would be to correct\nany error rather than to perpetuate or introduce one.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_149\">89.    Also, though the BIPA constitutes an arbitration agreement between a\nprivate investor on the one side and the host State on the other, yet it is\nneither an International Commercial Arbitration governed by the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_60\">Arbitration\nand Conciliation Act, 1996</a> (hereinafter referred to as &quot;Act, 1996&quot;) nor a\ndomestic arbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_150\">90.    <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_61\">The Act, 1996</a> including <a href=\"/doc/26823/\" id=\"a_62\">Sections 5</a> and 45 thereof, do not apply\nproprio vigore to a BIPA. <a href=\"/doc/26823/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 5</a> does not apply as this is not a Part I\narbitration and Section 45 does not apply as <a href=\"/doc/912862/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 44</a> makes it clear that\n<a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_65\">Part II of the Act, 1996</a> will apply to an arbitration considered to be\ncommercial under the Indian law.

This is a situation in which there is an international\n     treaty to which India is not a signatory or general rules of\n     international law are made applicable.

The treaty also\ninvolves a deliberate attempt to ensure for private investors the benefits and\nprotection of consensual arbitration; and this is an aim to which the National\nCourts should, in an internationalist spirit and because it has been agreed at\nan international level, aspire to give effect.

The question may then arise: under what law is\n     that agreement to arbitrate to be regarded as subject, applying\n     the principles of private international law of the English\n     forum?.....All this being so, we would be minded to accept that,\n     under English private international law principles, the agreement\n     to arbitrate may itself be subject to international law, as it may\n     be subject to foreign law.

And, if one\n     assumes that this is possible, then that is the view that we would,\n     like the judge, take of this particular arbitration agreement.\n     Although it is a consensual agreement, it is closely connected\n     with the international treaty which contemplated its making, and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                    Page 65 of 81</span>\n      which contains the provisions defining the scope of the\n     arbitrators&#x27; jurisdiction. Further, the protection of investors at\n     which the whole scheme is aimed is likely to be better served if\n     the agreement to arbitrate is subject to international law, rather\n     than to the law of the state against which an investor is\n     arbitrating.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_171\">                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_172\">103. Consequently, the agreement to arbitrate between an investor and a\nhost State is contractual inasmuch as it is not itself a treaty but flows from\nthe treaty provisions which is justiciable in accordance with the principles of\ninternational law and there is no threshold bar or inherent lack of jurisdiction\nin the court to deal with BIPA Arbitrations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_173\">WHETHER THE COURTS IN INDIA CAN RESTRAIN BILATERAL\nINVESTMENT TREATY ARBITRATIONS, WHICH ARE OPPRESSIVE,\nVEXATIOUS, INEQUITABLE OR AN ABUSE OF THE LEGAL PROCESS?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\">104. In the opinion of this Court, there is no unqualified or indefeasible\nright to arbitrate. The National Courts in India do have and retain the\njurisdiction to restrain international treaty arbitrations which are oppressive,\nvexatious, inequitable or constitute an abuse of the legal process.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_175\">105. As pointed out by the learned Amicus Curiae, the concepts of\n„oppression, „vexation‟, „inequity‟ and „abuse of process‟ have been known\nto the common law and equity for centuries, being the primary theories used\nby the court to regulate its process pursuant to its inherent jurisdiction. The\nCaribbean Court of Justice, Appellate Jurisdiction in British Caribbean\nBank Limited (supra) has held as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">     &quot;33.   The concepts of vexation and oppression are derived\n     from the old common law cases of McHenry v Lewis, Peruvian\n     Guano Co v Bockwoldt, and Hyman v Helm and are elucidated\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 66 of 81</span>\n      by two examples from Jessel MR in the Peruvian case; namely,\n     one of pure vexation where the proceedings are so absurd that\n     they cannot succeed, and the other where there is no intention to\n     harass or annoy but the litigant seeks some fanciful advantage by\n     suing in two courts at the same time under the same jurisdiction.\n     But it would not be vexatious to bring an action in each country\n     where there are substantial reasons of benefit to the plaintiff.\n     There is no presumption that a multiplicity of proceedings is\n     vexatious or that proceedings are vexatious merely because they\n     are brought in an inconvenient place.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">     34.     Proceedings may be restrained not only because they are\n     vexatious in the sense of being frivolous or useless but also\n     because they are oppressive. An example of oppression occurs\n     where a litigant may be encouraged to pursue proceedings in a\n     forum, having no connection with the subject matter of the\n     dispute, by inducements of enhanced remedies including punitive\n     damages. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"72322539\" id=\"span_91\">In normal circumstances, the widely recognized\n     principle of forum non conveniens will apply but the court will\n     restrain proceedings where a party acting under the colour of\n     seeking justice acts in a way which necessarily creates injustice\n     to others: see Castanho v Brown &amp; Root and <a href=\"/doc/72322539/\" id=\"a_93\">Spiliado Maritime\n     Corporation v Consulex Ltd</a>.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_176\">                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\">106. Broadly speaking, the doctrine of abuse of rights is founded upon the\nnotion that a party may have a valid right, including a procedural right, and\nyet exercise it in an abnormal, excessive or abusive way, with the sole\npurpose of causing injury to another or for the purpose of evading a rule of\nlaw, so as to forfeit its entitlement to rely upon it. The theory of abuse of\nrights has its origins in private law and is recognized in the great majority of\nnational legal systems. In France, a general theory of abuse of rights was\ndeveloped by legal theorists and came to be applied by the French courts as\nearly as the mid-nineteenth century. The principle of abuse of rights is also\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 67 of 81</span>\n enshrined in several provisions of the French <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_94\">Code of Civil Procedure</a>.\nOther civil law jurisdictions recognize a general theory of abuse of right,\nincluding Switzerland [Swiss Civil Code, art 2], Germany [German Civil\nCode, art 226], Austria [Austrian Civil Code, art 1295(2)], Italy [Italian\nCivil Code, art 833], Spain [Spanish Civil Code, art 7], The Netherlands\n[Dutch Civil Code, Property Law, art 13(2)] and Quebec [Civil Code of\nQuebec, art 7] and Louisiana in the United States.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_178\">107. While common law systems do not recognize any general principle of\nabuse of right, English courts have long upheld their inherent jurisdiction to\nsanction a party&#x27;s exercise of its procedural rights in an abusive manner. For\ninstance, in Hunter Vs. Chief Constable of the West Midlands Police,\n[1982] AC 529 at 536, Lord Diplock elaborated on &quot;[the] inherent power\nwhich any court of justice must possess to prevent misuse of its procedure in\na way which, although not inconsistent with the literal application of its\nprocedural rules, would nevertheless be manifestly unfair to a party to\nlitigation before it, or would otherwise bring the administration of justice\ninto disrepute among right-thinking people.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_179\">108. The principle of abuse of rights also forms part of public international\nlaw, and occurs where &#x27;a State avails itself of its right in an arbitrary\nmanner in such a way as to inflict upon another State an injury which\ncannot be justified by legitimate considerations of its own advantage&#x27;. The\nnotion of abuse of process is considered an application of the abuse of rights\nprinciple, and &#x27;consists of the use of procedural instruments or rights by one\nor more parties for purposes that are alien to those for which the procedural\nrights were established&#x27;. These principles have frequently been recognized\nby the International Court of Justice (ICJ) (See United Kingdom Vs.\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                  Page 68 of 81</span>\n Norway, [1951] ICJ 3, France Vs.

Similarly, the Indian Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1857811/\" id=\"a_95\">Modi Entertainment Network</a>\n(supra) has held, ―The courts in India like the courts in England are courts\nof both law and equity. The principles governing grant of injunction -- an\nequitable relief -- by a court will also govern grant of anti-suit injunction\nwhich is but a species of injunction. When a court restrains a party to a\nsuit/proceeding before it from instituting or prosecuting a case in another\ncourt including a foreign court, it is called anti-suit injunction....&quot;</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_181\">110. Being principles common to many national legal systems and\nrecognized under public international law, the prohibitions of abuse of rights\nand abuse of process are recognized as general principles of law that are\napplied by courts and arbitral tribunal, irrespective of the seat of the\narbitration or the applicable law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_182\">111. There is also no legal basis to support the wide proposition that a\nState, after agreeing to resolve its disputes with foreign investors under a\nspecific dispute resolution mechanism in an international treaty, cannot\nrestrain invocation of such rights by recourse to its National Courts. In\nExcalibur Ventures LLC v. Texas Keystone Inc. &amp; Others [2011] 2 Lloyds\nLaw Report 289, the English Court recognised that the Court had a limited\npower to intervene under the provisions of its <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_96\">Arbitration Act, 1996</a> but\nnevertheless, in exceptional cases, ―for example, where the continuation of\nthe    foreign    arbitration     proceedings     may      be    oppressive          or\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                      Page 69 of 81</span>\n unconscionable....the court may exercise its power under Section 37 of the\nSenior Courts Act, 1981‖ to grant an injunction. In fact, the said judgment\ncites seven cases which have upheld the Court‟s jurisdiction to restrain\nforeign seated arbitrations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_183\">112. Undoubtedly, under the International law, &quot;the State&quot; includes the\nnational judiciary; but under the Indian Constitution the State excludes the\njudiciary because it is independent of the other organs of the State.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_184\">113. Further, all actions and orders passed by National Courts are not per\nse violative of the fair and equitable treatment guaranteed by the BIPA as\nsuggested by the Defendants.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_185\">114. However, the jurisdiction to grant an anti-arbitration injunction must\nbe exercised with caution and granted only if the arbitral proceedings are\nvexatious or oppressive or inequitable or abuse of process. After all, one\nmust not lose sight of the fact that a legislation or action that is perfectly\nlawful under the national law could nonetheless trigger a successful\ninvestment claim under the bilateral investment treaty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_186\">115. In fact the approach to arbitration agreements contained in investment\ntreaties is for the court to support, so far as possible, the bargain for\ninternational arbitration. It is ―only with extreme hesitation‖ that the Court\nwould interfere with the process of arbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_187\">116.

The Indian Arbitration Act is largely based on the\nUNCITRAL Rules and the Model Law. <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_98\">Section 16</a> of the Act, 1996\nincorporates <a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_99\">Article 16</a> of the Model Law.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 70 of 81</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_188\"> 117. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"182683681\" id=\"span_97\">India has taken a far more restrictive approach in the context of\nInternational Commercial Arbitrations and in <a href=\"/doc/182683681/\" id=\"a_100\">McDonald&#x27;s India Private\nLimited Vs.

Upon an in-depth analysis of the Orascom Award, it is apparent that it\ndoes not hold that multiple claims by companies in a vertical structure under\ndifferent treaties against same State measures will always be an abuse of\nrights. In fact, in the said case, the arbitral tribunal found that as a matter of\nfact and law raising multiple claims under multiple treaties, amounted to\nabuse of rights.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_198\">125. This Court is also of the view that it will not grant an injunction if by\ndoing so it, deprives the Defendants of advantages in the foreign forum of\nwhich it would be unjust to deprive the Defendants. The fact that it may be\ninconvenient or expensive for Plaintiff-Union of India to litigate before the\narbitral tribunal is not an issue that would justify a finding of oppression.\nThis problem can, in the opinion of the court, be overcome by either\naccepting appropriate undertakings or by passing a conditional order. The\nCaribbean Court of Justice, Appellate Jurisdiction in British Caribbean\nBank Limited (supra) has held as under:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_93\">     &quot;51      The giving of undertakings of this kind is scarcely foreign\n     in international commercial disputes.

As early as the turn of the Twentieth Century an\n     undertaking was accepted by an English court as part of the\n     measures that facilitated a stay of English proceedings in favour\n     of enforcing the agreement by the parties to litigate their dispute\n     in a German Court: Kirchner &amp; Co. v Gruban. An undertaking\n     was accepted in Jarvis and Sons Limited v Blue Circle Dartford\n     Estates Limited to reduce the risk that concurrent proceedings in\n     England and in the foreign arbitration could result in the party\n     that was resisting arbitration being mulcted in damages twice\n     over. In light of that undertaking the court held that risks posed\n     by the concurrent proceedings were now so low that the\n     arbitration could not be characterized as oppressive. It is\n     significant in the case before us that a majority in the Court of\n     Appeal accepted that the undertaking by the Appellate nullified\n     any vexation or oppression that might otherwise be caused by the\n     simultaneous pursuit of the arbitration and the local claim for\n     compensation....&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_199\">                                                  (emphasis supplied)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_200\">126. The plea that Plaintiff-Union of India will be vexed twice over in\nrespect of identical claim or that there is a possibility of conflicting awards\nby two different tribunals, is resolved by accepting the Defendants‟ offer\ndated 9th January, 2018 that if the Plaintiff-Union of India gives its consent,\nit would apply straightaway to the UK treaty tribunal to consolidate the two\nproceedings. The Defendants are held bound by the said offer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_201\">127. This Court is further in agreement with the submission made by\nlearned Amicus Curiae that the Defendants‟ aforesaid offer is a better option\nthan the ‗sequential arbitrations&#x27; suggested by learned senior counsel for the\nPlaintiff-Union of India. The consolidated proceedings would ensure that no\nrelief is granted twice over and there is no conflict of awards.

However, as the learned senior counsel for Plaintiff-Union of India\nstated during the course of arguments that the plaint was prepared by 01 st\nAugust, 2017 and the letters dated 07th August and 11th August, 2017 were\nnot disclosed/made available to the local lawyers before the filing on 11 th\nAugust, 2017 and re-filing on 16th August, 2017, this Court gives the benefit\nof doubt to the Plaintiff and does not record a finding of wilful suppression\nor a conduct vitiated by malice.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                  Page 76 of 81</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_208\"> WHETHER IN VIEW OF THE CONSTITUTION OF THE ARBITRAL\nTRIBUNAL DURING THE PENDENCY OF THE PROCEEDINGS, THE\nPRESENT SUIT HAS BECOME INFRUCTUOUS?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_209\">133. The cause of action for filing the present suit was that the arbitral\ntribunal under the India-United Kingdom BIPA may be constituted without\nIndia being represented. The Plaintiff-Union of India has now appointed an\narbitrator, and after the orders of the Supreme Court of India, the Chairman\nstands appointed by the two party-appointed arbitrators. The tribunal is\ncomplete. The challenge to the invocation has run its course. Any challenge\nto its jurisdiction [including any challenge to the validity of the invocation\nof arbitration on allegations of abuse] must lie before the Tribunal. This is in\naccord with the principle of kompetenz kompetenz - which is recognised and\naccepted even under Indian domestic law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_210\">WHETHER THE PLAINTIFF UNDER THE DOCTRINE OF\nKOMPETENZ-KOMPETENZ, HAS TO RAISE THE PLEA OF MULTIPLE\nCLAIMS CONSTITUTING AN ACT OF OPPRESSION BEFORE THE\nSAME ARBITRAL TRIBUNAL?\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_211\">134. The principle of kompetenz-kompetenz, is recognised in <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_109\">Article 21</a> of\nthe UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules, 1976 and the same is explicitly engrafted\nin the India-United Kingdom BIPA. It is generally accepted that an arbitral\ntribunal has the power to investigate its own jurisdiction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_212\">135. The principle that arbitrators have the jurisdiction to consider and\ndecide the existence and extent of their own jurisdiction is variously referred\nto as the kompetenz-kompetenz principle or the &#x27;who decides&#x27; question.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_213\">136. Under the doctrine of kompetenz-kompetenz, the arbitrators are\ncompetent to determine their jurisdiction although the effective exercise of\nthat jurisdiction remains subject to the inherent competence of the seat-court\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 77 of 81</span>\n (i.e. the place of arbitration as stipulated in the agreement or as fixed by the\narbitrators/parties) to decide, in relation to an injunction to restrain\ninternational arbitration, whether a particular dispute falls within the scope\nof the arbitration agreement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_214\">137. Whether the arbitrators under the India-United Kingdom BIPA choose\nto stay the arbitral proceedings properly brought before them, whilst related\narbitration proceedings are pending is entirely a matter for them under the\ndoctrine of kompetenz-kompetenz and the circumstance that arbitrators may\ndo so cannot form an appropriate basis for the National Court to restrain the\narbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_215\">138. It is pertinent to mention that the arbitral tribunal in Orascom case\nconsidered each claim with the assistance of expert evidence to conclude\nthat they overlapped with the claims made under a previous settled\narbitration. It was only after such factual determination that the tribunal\nfound Orascom&#x27;s action to be an abuse of the right to invoke arbitration. In\nfact the Orascom Award is an illustration of the competence inherent in the\nBIPA arbitral tribunal to determine its own jurisdiction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_216\">139. This Court is of the opinion that it should apply the principle of\nkompetenz-kompetenz with full rigour as India-United Kingdom BIPA\narbitral tribunal would be better placed to assess the scope of the two BIPA\narbitration proceedings and the likelihood of parallel proceedings and abuse\nof process.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_217\">140. This Court is further of the view that the Plaintiff-Union of India after\nhaving elected its remedy of agitating the issue of abuse of process before\nthe Netherlands-India BIPA Tribunal could not have approached the\nNational Court on the same ground and, that too, without waiting for the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 78 of 81</span>\n award being rendered by the India-Netherlands BIPA Tribunal. After all,\nthe present suit is not and cannot be an appeal against the India-Netherlands\nBIPA Tribunal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_218\">                                  THANKS\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_219\">141. Before parting with this case, the Court expresses its appreciation for\nthe services rendered by Mr Harish Salve and Mr Sanjay Jain, Senior\nAdvocates (as well as the team of lawyers that assisted them), for their able\nand lucid exposition of the law. This Court expresses its deep gratitude to\nthe learned Amicus Curiae, Mr. Sumeet Kachwaha who not only spared his\nvaluable time but who also despite the presence of eminent senior counsel,\nlifted the level of debate and rendered valuable assistance to the court on\nimportant questions of BIPA arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_220\">                               CONCLUSION\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_221\">142. To conclude, investment treaty arbitration between a private investor\nand the host State, which results by following the treaty route is not itself a\ntreaty, but is sui generis and recognized as such all over the world. It has its\nroots in public international law, obligations of States and administrative\nlaw. As a species of arbitrations, it is of recent origin and its jurisprudence\ncannot be said to be settled or written in stone; far from it. Investment\nTreaty jurisprudence is still a work in progress.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_222\">143. However, there is some disquiet over the spectrum of nations both\ndeveloped and developing as to the spiraling consequences of investment\nawards and its impact on sovereign functions, as reflected in the speech of\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                   Page 79 of 81</span>\n Mr. Justice Sundaresh Menon, Chief Justice of Singapore on International\nArbitration : The Coming of New Age for Asia (and Elsewhere) (supra).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_223\">144. It also cannot be said as an absolute proposition of law that the\nmoment there is an investment treaty arbitration between a private investor\nand the State, National Courts are divested of their jurisdiction. The Court of\nAppeal in England in Republic of Ecuador (supra) rejected the argument\nthat the Courts have no jurisdiction to interpret or apply unincorporated\nInternational treaties between an investor and a host State. Consequently, in\nthe opinion of this Court, there is no legal bar over the subject matter of the\nsuit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_224\">145. Further, Investment Arbitration disputes are fundamentally different\nfrom commercial disputes as the cause of action (whether contractual or not)\nis grounded on State guarantees and assurances (and are not commercial in\nnature).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_225\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"182683681\" id=\"span_111\">146. As the present case is not a commercial arbitration, the Act, 1996\nshall not apply. This Court is of the view that in a situation where the Act,\n1996 does not apply, its inherent powers are not circumscribed by anything\ncontained in the Act and the ratio in <a href=\"/doc/182683681/\" id=\"a_110\">McDonald</a> (supra) will not apply. Even\nin commercial arbitration, the jurisprudence of minimum intervention is\nrelatively of recent vintage. It has its roots in <a href=\"/doc/1937835/\" id=\"a_111\">Article 5</a> of the Model Law of\n1985 which then took fifteen to twenty years to gain traction and general\nacceptance in the body of nations.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_226\">147. Notwithstanding, this limited intervention role, it is not unknown for\nCourts to issue anti arbitration injunction under their inherent power,\nespecially when neither the seat of arbitration nor the curial law has been\nagreed upon. In Excalibur Ventures LLC (supra), the Court held that where\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                  Page 80 of 81</span>\n the foreign arbitration was oppressive or unconscionable, the Court may\nexercise its power to grant an injunction. In fact, the said judgment cites\nseven cases which have upheld the Court‟s jurisdiction to restrain foreign\nseated arbitrations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_227\">148. Of course, it is a matter of practice that National Courts will exercise\ngreat self restraint and grant injunction only if there are very compelling\ncircumstances and the Court has been approached in good faith and there is\nno alternative efficacious remedy available. Such a restrictive approach and\njurisdiction is in consonance with any international obligation, India may\nhave under VCLT or any other treaty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_228\">149. However, keeping in view the aforesaid findings vis-a-vis, the abuse\nof process, kompetenz-kompetenz issues, the present suit and application are\ndismissed with liberty to the Plaintiff-Union of India to raise the issue of\nabuse of process before India-United Kingdom BIPA, that now stands\nconstituted. The said Tribunal will decide this issue on its own merit,\nwithout being influenced by any observation made by this Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_229\">150. The Tribunal while deciding the said issue will take into account the\nDefendants&#x27; undertaking to this Court that if the Plaintiff-Union of India\ngives its consent, it would agree to consolidation of the two BIPA arbitration\nproceedings before the India-United Kingdom BIPA Tribunal. Accordingly,\nthe ex parte interim order dated 22nd August, 2017 stands vacated. No order\nas to costs.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_230\">                                                          MANMOHAN, J\nMAY 07, 2018\njs/rn\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">CS(OS) 383/2017                                                  Page 81 of 81</span>\n </p>","numcites":66,"numcitedby":4,"docsource":"Delhi High Court","citetid":15132051,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"private international law","formInput":"private%20international%20law"},{"value":"parallel proceedings","formInput":"parallel%20proceedings"},{"value":"administrative law","formInput":"administrative%20law"},{"value":"section 9 of civil procedure code","formInput":"section%209%20of%20civil%20procedure%20code"},{"value":"harish salve","formInput":"harish%20salve"},{"value":"\"single economic entity\"","formInput":"%22single%20economic%20entity%22"},{"value":"anti arbitration injunction","formInput":"anti%20arbitration%20injunction"},{"value":"section 9 cpc","formInput":"section%209%20cpc"},{"value":"kompetenz kompetenz","formInput":"kompetenz%20kompetenz"},{"value":"bilateral investment treaty","formInput":"bilateral%20investment%20treaty"},{"value":"article 21","formInput":"article%2021"},{"value":"treaty is law","formInput":"treaty%20is%20law"},{"value":"cause of action","formInput":"cause%20of%20action"},{"value":"foreign judgments","formInput":"foreign%20judgments"},{"value":"parallel proceedings,parallel proceedings","formInput":"parallel%20proceedings%2Cparallel%20proceedings"},{"value":"amicus curiae","formInput":"amicus%20curiae"},{"value":"consolidation of arbitration","formInput":"consolidation%20of%20arbitration"},{"value":"rule of law","formInput":"rule%20of%20law"},{"value":"submit to jurisdiction","formInput":"submit%20to%20jurisdiction"},{"value":"jurisprudence","formInput":"jurisprudence"}],"cats":[{"value":"protection-of-life-and-liberty","formInput":"tag:protection-of-life-and-liberty"},{"value":"finance","formInput":"tag:finance"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
