Contention on behalf of the Petitioner is that vide letter dated\n                    26.04.2018 the initial LoA was amended and it was agreed between the\n                    parties that the Solar PV modules will be procured and supplied by\n                    Respondent No. 1 and not by the Petitioner and cost will be adjusted\n                    from the bills to be raised by the Petitioner. Most of the solar modules\n                    provided by Respondent No. 1 were not of good quality resulting in\n                    deficiency in generation of targeted energy. Modules were tested by an\n                    independent agency appointed by Respondent No. 1 and it was found\n                    that they were not of the required quality and this fact was intimated to\n                    Respondent No. 1 vide letter dated 30.08.2019 enclosing copy of the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">Signature Not VerifiedReport.

It is submitted that the delay in commissioning the project, if any,\n                    is attributable to Respondent No. 1, being a direct consequence of delay\n                    in supply of material, non-readiness of bay feeder, non-provision of\n                    ready to use land and encroachment on project sites etc. Petitioner had\n                    also represented to Respondent No. 1 that less than the desired\n                    generation of power was due to multiple reasons such as under\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">                    performance of solar panels supplied by Respondent No. 1, non-\n                    replacement of damaged panels, floods, poor quality of grid, frequent\n                    tripping and therefore Petitioner cannot be blamed for the alleged\n                    defaults/lapses. Despite this Respondent No. 1 arbitrarily sought to\n                    deduct Liquidated Damages to the tune of Rs.5.62 Crores for alleged\n                    delay in commissioning of the project and Rs.14.09 Crores on account of\n                    penalty against less generation of power in the projects.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">                    10.      It is further contended that due to the illegal act of Respondent No.\n                    1 in withholding and not releasing the outstanding amount of Rs.23.90\n                    Crores and levying and enforcing Liquidated Damages and penalty\n                    thereon, it became difficult for the Petitioner to continue with the O&amp;M\n                    work on few sites of the project and it was unable to retain the vendors\n                    due to cash crunch. It was owing to this that few of the project sites had\n                    to shut down forcibly. Nonetheless, it is stated by the Petitioner that as\n                    on date out of total 48 fully commissioned project sites in Maharashtra,\n                    14 are operational, where Petitioner is keeping up its O&amp;M\n                    commitments.

It was also\n                    submitted that invocation/encashment of the CPGs is not only illegal but\n                    would further worsen the financial position of the Petitioner, which is a\n                    Government of India enterprise and is already running as a loss making\n                    concern.

Per contra, learned counsel for Respondent No. 1 contends that\n                    the status quo order passed by this Court be vacated and Respondent No.\n                    1 should be permitted to encash the CPGs as well as proceed to terminate\n                    the contract under LoA dated 11.01.2018. Petitioner is in gross breach of\n                    the terms and conditions of the LoA and tender conditions as it has not\n                    only failed to install the awarded capacity of 120 MW Solar Power\n                    Generating Systems (SPGS) at various sub-stations in Maharashtra, but\n                    has also failed to maintain the same under the O&amp;M contract. This has\n                    resulted in several complaints being received from MSEDCL, who are\n                    end customers with whom Respondent No. 1 has independent supply\n                    contracts. Since Petitioner failed to operate and maintain the SPGS for\n                    optimum production of clean energy on investment of over Rs.201\n                    Crores by Respondent No. 1, several reminders were sent by e-mails\n                    dated 01.06.2022, 02.06.2022, 08.06.2022 and 10.06.2022 bringing to its\n                    notice shortfalls in daily generation reports, but there was no response.\n                    Petitioner was also put to notice of the non-working of Online\n                    Monitoring of 40 sites, however, no action was taken to rectify the faults\n                    in the systems. A meeting was convened on 02.06.2022 between\n                    Respondent No. 1 and the Petitioner to resolve the issues of shutting\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Signature Not Verifieddown of SPGS sites and failure to achieve optimum production on the</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">Digitally Signed        O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 44/2023                               Page 6 of 34</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">By:KAMAL KUMAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">Signing Date:07.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">15:22:14</span>\n                     installed sites but to no avail. A Default Notice cum Termination Letter\n                    dated 27.06.2022 was also sent to the Petitioner highlighting the defaults\n                    and breaches as also the fact that it had carried out installation and\n                    commissioning of 57 sites with only 59.80 MWp capacities as also that\n                    23 sites with total capacity of 16.73 MWp were under complete\n                    shutdown for a considerable period. Petitioner was also informed that\n                    considering that National assets cannot be allowed to remain unattended,\n                    particularly, in the high power demand scenario, Respondent No. 1\n                    would be constrained to take actions as per contractual provisions.\n                    Despite this notice, the highlighted defaults and breaches were never\n                    cured by the Petitioner and Respondent No. 1 continued to suffer\n                    financial loss. This constrained Respondent No. 1 to issue a final Default\n                    Notice dated 31.01.2023 giving an opportunity of yet another 14 days to\n                    rectify the breach but no corrective action was taken by the Petitioner\n                    even thereafter.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">                    12.      It is contended that in the light of the breaches and defaults\n                    committed by the Petitioner, which were repeatedly brought to its notice\n                    and not cured, Respondent No. 1 had no option but to issue a final\n                    Default Notice and invoke the CPGs. Clause 2.5.4 (xiii) of Scope of\n                    Work, under the heading &#x27;Maintenance&#x27;, which is a part of the tender\n                    conditions, provides that if any jobs covered in O&amp;M scope as per O&amp;M\n                    plan are not carried out by the System Integrator during the O&amp;M\n                    period, the Engineer-in-Charge can issue a notice to the System\n                    Integrator and repetition of such instances for more than two times a year\n                    may lead to termination of the O&amp;M contract by EESI/DISCOM and\n                    forfeiture of Bank Guarantee against the same. The power to encash the\n                    CPGs also emanates from Clause 13 of SCC with respect to O&amp;M Bank\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">Signature Not VerifiedGuarantee and Clause 18 of SCC with respect to CPG.</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">Digitally Signed        O.M.P.(I) (COMM.) 44/2023                               Page 7 of 34</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">By:KAMAL KUMAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">Signing Date:07.07.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">15:22:14</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"854142\" id=\"span_36\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"636783\" id=\"span_37\">13.      It is contended that the disputes that the Petitioner seeks to raise\n                    before this Court in respect of breaches/lapses and/or proposed\n                    termination of the contract cannot be a subject matter of a petition under\n                    <a href=\"/doc/1079220/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 9</a> of the 1996 Act and if the Petitioner is aggrieved, the same can\n                    be agitated before an appropriate forum in appropriate proceedings. It is\n                    not denied that the LoA was amended, however, it is denied that the\n                    modules supplied were not of good quality. As per amendment No. 1 in\n                    LoA, Respondent No. 1 was to transfer the modules of BHEL and TATA\n                    make, which were delivered on the sites by the module manufacturers\n                    and were accepted by the Petitioner on &#x27;as is where is&#x27; condition, without\n                    any request to test the modules before taking delivery. The issue of\n                    quality of modules was raised by the Petitioner only after Respondent\n                    No. 1 initiated performance evaluation of site with regard to generation\n                    and levied Liquidated Damages. Insofar as the testing report is\n                    concerned, as per Clause 15 of Amendment No. 1, in case the\n                    performance of the modules was not as per power output warranty\n                    during the O&amp;M period, then Respondent No. 1/appointed Agency was\n                    to carry out testing in any of the NABL accredited lab to evaluate the\n                    performance of the modules and thus the testing carried out by the\n                    Petitioner on its own accord has no legal sanctity. This dispute is only an\n                    afterthought as Petitioner was unable to deliver the required guaranteed\n                    generation and commission the entire awarded value of 120 MW. Insofar\n                    as the CPGs are concerned, clearly the same are irrevocable and\n                    unconditional Bank Guarantees and it is trite that any dispute relating to\n                    the contract cannot be used as a ground for restraining encashment of\n                    Bank Guarantees, which is an independent contract between the Bank\n                    and the beneficiary and is governed by its own terms.

[(1997) 1 SCC 568] as follows : (SCC p. 574, para 12)\n                                     &quot;The law relating to invocation of such bank guarantees is by\n                                     now well settled. When in the course of commercial dealings\n                                     an unconditional bank guarantee is given or accepted, the\n                                     beneficiary is entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in\n                                     terms thereof irrespective of any pending disputes. The bank\n                                     giving such a guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms\n                                     irrespective of any dispute raised by its customer. The very\n                                     purpose of giving such a bank guarantee would otherwise be\n                                     defeated. The courts should, therefore, be slow in granting an\n                                     injunction to restrain the realization of such a bank\n                                     guarantee. The courts have carved out only two exceptions. A\n                                     fraud in connection with such a bank guarantee would vitiate\n                                     the very foundation of such a bank guarantee. Hence if there\n                                     is such a fraud of which the beneficiary seeks to take the\n                                     advantage, he can be restrained from doing so. The second\n                                     exception relates to cases where allowing the encashment of\n                                     an unconditional bank guarantee would result in\n                                     irretrievable harm or injustice to one of the parties\n                                     concerned. Since in most cases payment of money under such\n                                     a bank guarantee would adversely affect the bank and its\n                                     customer at whose instance the guarantee is given, the harm\n                                     or injustice contemplated under this head must be of such an\n                                     exceptional and irretrievable nature as would override the\n                                     terms of the guarantee and the adverse effect of such an\n                                     injunction on commercial dealings in the country.&quot;</span></span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">                                  Dealing with the question of fraud it has been held that fraud\n                                  has to be an established fraud.

There is not even a\n                                  proper allegation of any fraud as such and in fact the whole\n                                  case of the appellant centres around the allegation with regard\n                                  to the alleged breach of contract by the respondent. The plea of\n                                  fraud in the appellant&#x27;s own words is to the following effect:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">                                     &quot;That despite the respondent HCL being in default of not\n                                     making payment as stipulated in the bank guarantee, in\n                                     perpetration of abject dishonesty and fraud, the respondent\n                                     HCL fraudulently invoked the bank guarantee furnished by\n                                     the applicant and sought remittance of the sums under the\n                                     conditional bank guarantee from Oriental Bank of Commerce\n                                     vide letter of invocation dated 16-12-2003.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">                                  26.

On law, the High Court ought to have noticed that\n                                  the bank guarantee is an independent contract between the\n                                  guarantor Bank and the guarantee appellant. The guarantee is\n                                  unconditional, no doubt, the performance guarantee is against\n                                  the breach by the lead promoter viz. the first respondent. But\n                                  between the bank and the appellant, the specific condition\n                                  incorporated in the bank guarantee is that the decision of the\n                                  appellant as to the breach is binding on the Bank. The\n                                  justifiability of the decision is a different matter between the\n                                  appellant and the first respondent and it is not for the High\n                                  Court in a proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_19\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of\n                                  India to go into that question since several disputed questions of\n                                  fact are involved.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">                                  xxxxx\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">                                  11. It is contended on behalf of the first respondent that the\n                                  invocation of bank guarantee depends on the cancellation of the\n                                  contract and once the cancellation of the contract is not\n                                  justified, the invocation of bank guarantee also is not justified.\n                                  We are afraid that the contention cannot be appreciated.

All that emerges is that there are disputes\n                            between the appellant and the respondent No. 1 and it is not even\n                            whispered that the respondent No. 1 built the entire charade of\n                            entering into the contract, only to obtain BGs and to profiteer from\n                            the appellant. With respect to the ground urged by the senior counsel\n                            for the appellant, of special equities, the Solicitor General has stated\n                            that the appellant is a Chinese entity and if ultimately in arbitration,\n                            which has already commenced between the parties, the monies are\n                            found due to the respondent No. 1 from the appellant, the respondent\n                            No. 1 would have no means or ways available to it for recovering the\n                            same from the appellant and/or to enforce the arbitral award in\n                            China. On the contrary, it is contended that the respondent No. 1 is a\n                            Public Sector Undertaking and the monies, if ultimately found due to\n                            the appellant from the respondent No. 1, can always be recovered by\n                            the appellant from the respondent No. 1.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">                            16.

In cases where the bank guarantee is unconditional,\n                                         the law recognizes only three circumstances in which\n                                         Courts could injunct invocation or encashment of the bank\n                                         guarantee. These three circumstances, essentially, dovetail\n                                         into two, with the pronouncement of Courts in that regard.\n                                         The three circumstances, in which the Courts may\n                                         interfere, and may injunct the invocation of unconditional\n                                         bank guarantees, is where there is egregious fraud,\n                                         special equity exists, or where irretrievable injustice or\n                                         prejudice is likely to result, if the bank guarantee is\n                                         invoked or encashed. The latter two circumstances have\n                                         been treated, by the Supreme Court, as well as by the\n                                         Division Bench of this Court in CRSC Design to be\n                                         interconnected, in that special equities would be set to\n                                         exist if the invocation of the bank guarantee would result\n                                         in irretrievable injustice to the opposite party.

There are, however, two exceptions to this rule.\n                                            The first is when there is a clear fraud of which the\n                                            bank has notice and a fraud of the beneficiary from\n                                            which it seeks to benefit. The fraud must be of an\n                                            egregious nature as to vitiate the entire underlying\n                                            transaction. The second exception to the general rule of\n                                            nonintervention is when there are &#x27;special equities&#x27; in\n                                            favour of injunction, such as when &#x27;irretrievable injury&#x27;\n                                            or &#x27;irretrievable injustice&#x27; would occur if such an\n                                            injunction were not granted.

Once, however, the beneficiary of the bank guarantee\n                            proceeds towards invocation of the bank guarantee by writing to the\n                            bank, the first argument, of the invocation being contrary to the\n                            terms of the parent contract between the parties, ceases to be\n                            available to the contractor. The reason is simple. Referring to the\n                            facts of the present case, the petitioner has instructed the bank to\n                            issue bank guarantees favouring HPL, for availing the benefit of\n                            which HPL merely had to communicate to the bank stating that the\n                            amount claimed was required to meet the recoveries due from the\n                            petitioner. Once, therefore, such a communication was made by HPL\n                            to the bank, the petitioner could not seek, thereafter, to interdict\n                            invocation of the bank guarantee by referring to the terms of the\n                            original contract.

The law relating to invocation of such bank guarantees is by\n                            now well settled. When in the course of commercial dealings an\n                            unconditional bank guarantee is given or accepted, the beneficiary is\n                            entitled to realize such a bank guarantee in terms thereof\n                            irrespective of any pending disputes. The bank giving such a\n                            guarantee is bound to honour it as per its terms irrespective of any\n                            dispute raised by its customer. The very purpose of giving such a\n                            bank guarantee would otherwise be defeated. The courts should,\n                            therefore, be slow in granting an injunction to restrain the\n                            realization of such a bank guarantee. The courts have carved out\n                            only two exceptions. A fraud in connection with such a bank\n                            guarantee would vitiate the very foundation of such a bank\n                            guarantee. Hence if there is such a fraud of which the beneficiary\n                            seeks to take advantage, he can be restrained from doing so. The\n                            second exception relates to cases where allowing the encashment of\n                            an unconditional bank guarantee would result in irretrievable harm\n                            or injustice to one of the parties concerned. Since in most cases\n                            payment of money under such a bank guarantee would adversely\n                            affect the bank and its customer at whose instance the guarantee is\n                            given, the harm or injustice contemplated under this head must be of\n                            such an exceptional and irretrievable nature as would override the\n                            terms of the guarantee and the adverse effect of such an injunction\n                            on commercial dealings in the country. The two grounds are not\n                            necessarily connected, though both may coexist in some cases. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"329587\" id=\"span_163\">In the\n                            case of <a href=\"/doc/329587/\" id=\"a_34\">U.P.

The bank\n                            which gives the guarantee is not concerned in the least with the\n                            relations between the supplier and the customer; nor with the\n                            question whether the supplier has performed his contractual\n                            obligation or not, nor with the question whether the supplier is in\n                            default or not. The bank must pay according to the tenor of its\n                            guarantee on demand without proof or condition. There are only two\n                            exceptions to this rule. The first exception is a case when there is a\n                            clear fraud of which the bank has notice. The fraud must be of an\n                            egregious nature such as to vitiate the entire underlying transaction.</span>\n                            Explaining the kind of fraud that may absolve a bank from\n                            honouring its guarantee, this Court in the above case quoted with\n                            approval the observations of Sir John Donaldson, M.R. in Bolivinter\n                            Oil SA v.

The duty of the bank under a performance\n                                  guarantee is created by the document itself. Once the documents\n                                  are in order the bank giving the guarantee must honour the\n                                  same and make payment ordinarily unless there is an allegation\n                                  of fraud or the like. The courts will not interfere directly or\n                                  indirectly to withhold payment, otherwise trust in commerce\n                                  internal and international would be irreparably damaged. But\n                                  that does not mean that the parties to the underlying contract\n                                  cannot settle the disputes with respect to allegations of breach\n                                  by resorting to litigation or arbitration as stipulated in the\n                                  contract. The remedy arising ex contractu is not barred and the\n                                  cause of action for the same is independent of enforcement of\n                                  the guarantee.&quot;</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">                            <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1988070\" id=\"span_171\">The other recent decision is in <a href=\"/doc/1988070/\" id=\"a_37\">Hindustan Steelworks Construction\n                            Ltd. v.

Clearly, therefore, the existence of any dispute between the\n                            parties to the contract is not a ground for issuing an injunction to\n                            restrain the enforcement of bank guarantees. There must be a fraud\n                            in connection with the bank guarantee. In the present case we fail to\n                            see any such fraud. The High Court seems to have come to the\n                            conclusion that the termination of the contract by the appellant and\n                            his claim that time was of the essence of the contract, are not based\n                            on the terms of the contract and, therefore, there is a fraud in the\n                            invocation of the bank guarantee.

The court has used\n                            this circumstance in aid of its view that the time was not of the\n                            essence of the contract. We fail to see how an earlier invocation of\n                            the bank guarantees and subsequent withdrawal of this invocation\n                            make the bank guarantees or their invocation tainted with fraud in\n                            any manner. Under the terms of the contract it is stipulated that the\n                            respondent is required to give unconditional bank guarantees\n                            against advance payments as also a similar bank guarantee for due\n                            delivery of the contracted plant within the stipulated period. In the\n                            absence of any fraud the appellant is entitled to realise the bank\n                            guarantees.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">                     28.     None of the two recognized exceptions to invocation of\n                     unconditional BGs exist in the present case. There are no pleadings of\n                     fraud, save and except, a vague averment that invocation is illegal and\n                     &#x27;fraudulent&#x27;. Petitioner has neither pleaded nor shown any act of\n                     Respondent No.1 which can be put at the threshold of egregious fraud.\n                     The present case also cannot be said to be one of irretrievable injustice as\n                     even the special equity is predicated on the alleged financial crunch, a\n                     ground negated by the Courts in several judgments to interdict the\n                     invocation of unconditional and irrevocable BGs. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"86349173\" id=\"span_174\">In this context, I may\n                     refer to a few passages from the judgment of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/86349173/\" id=\"a_38\">Kuber\n                     Enterprises v.

The last submission of Mr. Panda, to justify the prayer for\n                            injunction against invocation of the Bank Guarantee, is that the\n                            petitioner is in dire financial straits. He also draws attention to the\n                            financial defects being faced by his client and submits that if the\n                            Bank Guarantee is permitted to be invoked, his client would be\n                            &quot;deoxygenated&quot; and that several of its employees would be laid off.\n                            In the submission of Mr. Panda, the parent company of Respondent 1\n                            is presently facing severe financial constrains, and that Respondent\n                            1 is dependent on the parent company. In these circumstances, he\n                            submits, an additional ground for a restraint against the respondents\n                            from invoking the Bank Guarantee is that the Bank Guarantee would\n                            act as a security, in the event of an award in the arbitral proceedings\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_175\">Signature Not Verified      favourable to the petitioner.

Re. prayer for stay of invocation of bank guarantee:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">                            18.     Admittedly, the Bank Guarantee provided by the petitioner to\n                            the respondents is unconditional. Stay of invocation of an\n                            unconditional bank guarantee can be granted only in exceptional\n                            circumstances. This Court in SES Energy Services India\n                            Ltd. v.

In cases where the bank guarantee is unconditional, the law\n                                  recognizes only three circumstances in which Courts could\n                                  injunct invocation or encashment of the bank guarantee. These\n                                  three circumstances, essentially, dovetail into two, with the\n                                  pronouncement of Courts in that regard. The three\n                                  circumstances, in which the Courts may interfere, and may\n                                  injunct the invocation of unconditional bank guarantees, is\n                                  where there is egregious fraud, special equity exists, or where\n                                  irretrievable injustice or prejudice is likely to result, if the bank\n                                  guarantee is invoked or encashed. The latter two circumstances\n                                  have been treated, by the Supreme Court, as well as by the\n                                  Division Bench of this Court in <a href=\"/doc/188979765/\" id=\"a_39\">CRSC Research and Design\n                                  Institute Group Co Ltd v.

The second exception to the\n                                     general rule of non-intervention is when there are &#x27;special\n                                     equities&#x27; in favour of injunction, such as when &#x27;irretrievable\n                                     injury&#x27; or &#x27;irretrievable injustice&#x27; would occur if such an\n                                     injunction were not granted.
