The admitted facts of the case are that:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">2.    The petitioner and the respondent had entered into two composite\n\nContract   No.     CS--0270-151-2-FC-NOA-BRCBL/Nabinagar/10-11/22A\n\ndated 21.07.2010 relating to design, engineering, manufacturing etc. for the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">OMP No. 529/2014                                         Page 1 of 13</span>\n complete Fire Detection and Protection System for Nabinagar Thermal\n\nPower       Project    and     Contract     No.     CS-0270-151-2-SC-COA-\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_2\">BRCBL/Nabinagar/10-11/22B dated 21.07.2010 for the work of providing\n\nall services in the said Thermal Power Project. Both the contracts were\n\ncollectively called as the &quot;Contracts&quot; and were interlinked and overlapping\n\nand were essentially in the nature of one contract governed by the same\n\nGeneral Conditions of Contracts. In due compliance of the provisions of the\n\ncontract, the petitioner has submitted three bank guarantees. Two bank\n\nguarantees were in the nature of performance bank guarantees, the details of\n\nwhich are as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">i.      Supply contract-Bank Guarantee No.5520225509 dated 13.08.2010\n\nfor Rs. 1,81,57,388/-, the validity of the same is up to 10.01.2015.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">ii.     Erection contract--Bank Guarantee No.5520225510 dated 13.08.2010\n\nfor Rs. 38,64,761/-. The validity of this bank guarantee was till 10.01.2015.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">3.      The petitioner also submitted a bank guarantee No.5520225508 dated\n\n13.08.2010 for Rs. 2,62,63,710, valid up to 10.07.2013 as security against\n\nadvance in respect of supply contract.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">4.      The case of the petitioner is that time was not the essence of contract\n\nand the respondent had been extending the time for supply of the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">OMP No. 529/2014                                           Page 2 of 13</span>\n equipments. It is submitted that delay in completing the contracts had\n\noccurred on account of breaches on behalf of respondent No.1 as there was\n\ndelay in giving inputs on design of the equipment to be supplied under the\n\nsupply contract. It is further contended that the respondent No.1 had also\n\nfailed to handover any front or site to the petitioner, as per the obligations\n\nunder the contract. Out of total 54 work sites to be handed over, the\n\nrespondent No.1 had offered only four other work sites. Under the contract,\n\nthe respondent was required to handover 54 work sites/front by 04.11.2011.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_3\">It is submitted that the act of the respondent towards invoking the bank\n\nguarantee is tainted by fraud as the same has been done with the sole agenda\n\nand intent to avoid performance of its obligation under the contract and to\n\npenalize the petitioner in exercise of its contractual rights. The invocation\n\nhas been done with the sole ulterior motive of profiteering at the cost and\n\nprejudice to the petitioner. The petitioner had been prevented from\n\nperforming its obligation on account of the breach of material conditions of\n\nthe contract by the respondent No.1. It is submitted that such means of\n\nprofiteering specially by public sector undertaking are not only fraudulent,\n\nbut also inequitable and frowned upon and deprecated by Courts of Law and\n\ndoes not behove an esteemed organisation, especially a public sector\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">OMP No. 529/2014                                          Page 3 of 13</span>\n undertaking and for this reason alone, invocation of the bank guarantee\n\nneeds to be stayed. It is further submitted that invocation is contrary to the\n\nletter and spirit of the contract for the same reason that it is the respondent\n\nNo.1 who had failed to fulfil the obligations under the contract. It is\n\nsubmitted that the petitioner is not responsible for failure of performance\n\nunder the contract which had occurred due to the act of respondent No. 1.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">5.    The respondent, on the other hand, has stated that present petition is\n\nnot maintainable. It is submitted that all the three bank guarantees were\n\nunconditional bank guarantees and payable on demand by respondent Nos.2\n\nto respondent No.1. It is submitted that bank guarantees is an independent\n\nagreement between respondent No.1 and respondent No.2 and the Court can\n\ninterfere only when it is shown that the bank guarantee has been obtained by\n\nrespondent No.1 in a fraudulent manner and the fraud is of egregious nature.\n\nIt is submitted that the petitioner has not pleaded any grounds which can\n\nshow that a fraud has been committed upon them while obtaining the\n\nunconditional bank guarantee. It is further submitted that the petitioners\n\nhave also failed to show that they shall suffer any irreparable loss and injury\n\nif the bank guarantee is not stayed. It is argued that respondent is a public\n\nsector undertaking and, therefore, quite capable of compensating the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">OMP No. 529/2014                                           Page 4 of 13</span>\n petitioner in case they succeed. It is denied that respondent No.1 is\n\nresponsible for the delay in fulfilment of the contract or that they have failed\n\nto supply the site to the petitioners. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1028714\" id=\"span_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1342691\" id=\"span_6\">It is submitted that it was the petitioners\n\nwho had not fulfilled their part of the commitment under the agreement and,\n\ntherefore, the respondent had extended the period of completion of the\n\ncontract from time to time. It is submitted that the pendency of any arbitral\n\ndispute between the parties is not a ground to stay the invocation of bank\n\nguarantee. It is submitted that petition is liable to be dismissed. Reliance has\n\nbeen placed by the respondents on the findings in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1342691/\" id=\"a_2\">BSES Ltd. vs.\n\nFenner India Ltd. and Anr</a>, <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_3\">AIR 2006 SC 1148 and Vinitec Electronics\n\nPrivate Limited vs. HCL Infosystems Limited</a> (2008) 1 SCC 544.</span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1028714\" id=\"span_7\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1342691\" id=\"span_8\">6.    The petitioner in the rejoinder has submitted that this is one of the rare\n\ncases wherein the respondent No.1&#x27;s conduct is so egregiously fraudulent\n\nand lacking in bona fide that it vitiates the entire underlying transaction and,\n\ntherefore, their case falls within the exception to the rule of non-intervention\n\nas <a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_4\">laid down by</a> Supreme Court in the cases of <a href=\"/doc/1342691/\" id=\"a_5\">BSES Ltd.</a> (supra)and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1028714/\" id=\"a_6\">Vinitec Electronics Private Limited</a> (supra).

The present dispute relates to the release of the bank guarantees. The\n\nnature and purpose of the bank guarantees had been discussed by the\n\nSupreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1754916/\" id=\"a_7\">Hindustan Construction vs. State of Bihar</a>\n\n(1999) 8 SCC 436. The relevant paragraphs 8 and 9 of <a href=\"/doc/1754916/\" id=\"a_8\">the said judgment</a> are\n\nreproduced as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1754916\" id=\"span_11\">&quot;8. Now, a bank guarantee is the common mode of\n          securing payment of money in commercial dealings as\n          the beneficiary, under the Guarantee, is entitled to\n          realise the whole of the amount under that Guarantee in\n          terms thereof irrespective of any pending dispute\n          between the person on whose behalf the Guarantee was\n          given and the beneficiary. In contracts awarded to\n          private individuals by the Government, which involve\n          huge expenditure, as, for example, construction\n          contracts, Bank Guarantees are usually required to be\n          furnished in favour of the Government to secure\n          payments made to the contractor as &quot;advance&quot; from\n          time to time during the course of the contract as also to\n          secure performance of the work entrusted under the\n          contract. Such Guarantees are excusable in terms\n          thereof on the lapse of the contractor either in the\n          performance of the work or in paying back to the\n          &quot;Government Advance&quot;, the Guarantee is invoked and\n          the amount is recovered from the Bank. It is for this\n          reason that the Courts are reluctant in granting an\n          injunction against the invocation of Bank Guarantee,\n          except in the case of fraud, which should be an\n          established fraud, or where irretrievable injury was\n          likely to be caused to the Guarantor.

What is important, therefore, is that the Bank\n         Guarantee should be in unequivocal terms,\n         unconditional and recite that the amount would be paid\n         without demur or objection and irrespective of any\n         dispute that might have cropped up or might have been\n         pending between the beneficiary under the Bank\n         Guarantee or the person on whose behalf the Guarantee\n         was furnished. The terms of the Bank Guarantee are,\n         therefore, extremely material. Since the Bank\n         Guarantee represents an independent contract between\n         the Bank and the beneficiary, both the parties would be\n         bound by the terms thereof. The invocation, therefore,\n         will have to be in accordance with the terms of the\n         Bank Guarantee; or else, the invocation itself would be\n         bad.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">OMP No. 529/2014                                        Page 7 of 13</span>\n       Accordingly, the Courts are required to see the nature of the bank\n\nguarantee furnished by the petitioner. No dispute to the fact that the\n\npetitioner had furnished three bank guarantees to respondent No.1. Two\n\nwere of the nature of performance bank guarantees and the other bank\n\nguarantee is a security bank guarantee against the advance. The copies of all\n\nthe three bank guarantees have been placed on record by the petitioner. All\n\nthe bank guarantees were payable on demand by respondent No.2. Para 2 in\n\nall the three bank guarantees provides that &quot;We Citibank,.....do hereby\n\nguarantee and undertake to pay the Employer immediately on demand any\n\nor, all monies payable by the Contract, without any demur, reservation,\n\ncontest, recourse, or protest and /or without any reference to the Contract.\n\nAny such demand made by the Employer and the Contractor or any dispute\n\npending notwithstanding any difference between the Employer and the\n\nContract or any dispute pending before any Court, Tribunal, Arbitrator or\n\nany other authority. The bank undertakes not to revoke this guarantee\n\nduring its currency without previous consent of the Employer and further\n\nagrees that the guarantee herein contained shall be enforceable till ninety\n\n(90) days after expiry of its validity&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1754916\" id=\"span_20\">9.

Since in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1754916/\" id=\"a_17\">Hindustan Construction</a> (supra), the Supreme Court has held that bank\n\nguarantees are independent contracts between the beneficiary and the bank\n\nand since these bank guarantees are unconditional bank guarantees, the\n\ncontract between the beneficiary and the bank has to be honoured and the\n\nCourts cannot restrain the two contracting parties to honour their agreement\n\nunless except on two grounds, i.e., an egregious nature of fraud has been\n\nplayed upon the petitioner or that he shall suffer an irretrievable loss.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1329151\" id=\"span_22\">10.

The petitioner has contended that the bank guarantees have been\n\nobtained by fraud because the respondent No.1 was aware from the very\n\nbeginning that it would not be able to handover the vacant possession of the\n\nsite and since it has failed to handover the vacant possession of the site, the\n\npetitioner could not complete his part of obligation under the contract. The\n\nrespondent, on the contrary, has alleged that it was the petitioner who had\n\ndefaulted in performance and had not fulfilled his part of the contract.\n\nHence, the dispute has arisen between the parties regarding the fulfilment of\n\nthe obligations under the contract by both the parties and this has arisen\n\nduring performance of the contract.

It, therefore, cannot be said that any fraud, what to say of\n\negregious nature, had been played upon it, at the time of execution of the\n\npresent bank guarantees.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158014472\" id=\"span_30\">12.   Moreover, this Court in a recent judgment <a href=\"/doc/158014472/\" id=\"a_24\">Consortium of Deepak\n\nCable India Limited vs. Teestavalley Power Transmission Limited, FAO\n\n(OS</a>) 397 and 398/2014, has held that the existence or pendency of dispute\n\nrelating to the violation of terms of contract is no ground to grant injunction\n\nto invocation of Bank Guarantee. The relevant para is reproduced as under:-</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">             &quot;145..............Disputes pertaining to the main\n             contract cannot be considered by a court when a\n             claim under a bank guarantee is made and the\n             court would be precluded from embarking on an\n             enquiry pertaining to the prima facie nature of the\n             respective claim of the litigating parties relatable\n             to the main dispute. The dispute between the\n             parties to the underlying contract has to be decided\n             at the civil forum i.e. a civil suit if there exists no\n             arbitration clause in the contract or before the\n             arbitral tribunal if there exists an arbitration clause\n             in the contract. Pendency of arbitration\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">OMP No. 529/2014                                             Page 11 of 13</span>\n              proceedings is no consideration while deciding on\n             the issue of grant of an interim injunction. That\n             certain amounts have been recovered under\n             running bills and have to be adjusted for is of no\n             concern in matters relating to invocation of bank\n             guarantee. That there are serious disputes on\n             questions as to who committed the breach of the\n             contract are no circumstances justifying granting\n             an injunction pertaining to a bank guarantee. Plea\n             of lack of good faith and/or enforcing the\n             guarantee with an oblique purpose or that the bank\n             guarantee is being invoked as a bargaining chip, a\n             deterrent or in an abusive manner are all irrelevant\n             and hence have to be ignored. There are only two\n             well recognized exceptions to the rule against\n             permitting payment under a bank guarantee. The\n             same are:-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">             A. A fraud of egregious nature;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">             B. Encashment of the bank guarantee would result\n             in irretrievable harm or injustice of an irreversible\n             kind to one of the parties.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"158014472\" id=\"span_32\">13.   The petitioner has also contended that since the intention of the\n\nrespondent in invoking the bank guarantee is to enrich itself and this not\n\nonly is a fraudulent act on its part, but also inequitable. As discussed above,\n\nthe fraud of egregious nature played upon the petitioner has to be fraud\n\nwhich has been played upon the petitioner at the time when the bank\n\nguarantees were executed by him. The fraud should be of such a nature\n\nwhich shows that the petitioner was deceptively asked to issue the bank\n\nguarantees. As discussed above, in the present case, the petitioner has\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">OMP No. 529/2014                                            Page 12 of 13</span>\n neither pleaded nor has shown on record any facts which can show that a\n\nfraud had been played upon it at the time when the bank guarantees were\n\nexecuted by it. It has also been held by this Court in <a href=\"/doc/158014472/\" id=\"a_25\">Consortium of Deepak\n\nCable India Limited</a> (supra) that Courts are precluded from considering the\n\ndisputes between the parties arising out of the main contract, while dealing\n\nwith the matters relating to the encashment of the bank guarantees. The\n\nexistence of a dispute between the parties on account of failure of the terms\n\nof the contract does not in any way affect the right of the beneficiary to\n\nencash the bank guarantee.</span> The petitioner has also failed to show that he\n\nshall suffer an irretrievable injury if the stay is not granted to it.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_17\">14.    For the foregoing reasons, I find that there exists no ground to restrain\n\nthe beneficiary from invoking the bank guarantee. The petition has no merit\n\nand the same is dismissed.
