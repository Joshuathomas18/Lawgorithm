Thus, after coming into force of Act of 2015, the civil\n                           court is not having the jurisdiction to try to suit if the subject thereof is a commercial\n                           dispute within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/46356160/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 2(1)(c)</a> of the Act of 2015.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_10\">                                  9.

The second reason assigned by the learned Trial Court is apparently\n                           unsustainable inasmuch as an administrative order, like work distribution memo,\n                           cannot override the mandatory provision of a statue.

The issue needs to be\n                           decided taking into account the entire pleading as a whole and taking into account the\n                           documents filed in support of the plaint particularly the agreement between the\n                           parties. Thus, both the reasons assigned by learned Trial Court are unsustainable.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">                                  12. The moot question that arises for consideration in this case is as to whether\n                           the subject matter of suit is covered by <a href=\"/doc/46356160/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 2(1)(c)</a> of the Act of 2015. The learned\n                           counsel for applicant has invoked clause (vi) of <a href=\"/doc/109764397/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 3(1)(c)</a> of the Act to say that\n                           the subject matter of suit is &#x27;commercial dispute&#x27;. It is profitable to mention here that\n                           while deciding the issue as to whether the subject matter of a suit is a commercial\n                           dispute or not, the pleading made in the plaint as a whole needs to be looked into and\n                           not the prayer clause alone as has been done by the learned Trial Court. Further, the\n                           documents filed in support of plaint can also be examined in order to decide as to\n                           whether the subject matter of suit is a commercial dispute or not. My view in this\n                           regard finds support by judgment passed by coordinate bench of this court in the case\n                           o f M/s Bhopal Fracture Hospital &amp; others vs. Savitri Devi Vijaywargiya passed in\n                           C.R.

The term\n                           &#x27;construction&#x27; has been defined in Oxford learners dictionary as &quot;the process or method\n                           of building or making something&quot; while the &quot;infrastructure mean the basic physical\n                           and organizational structures and facilities (e.g. buildings, roads, power supplies)\n                           needed for the operation of a society or enterprise&quot;.

In the agreement between the parties in this case, the element of\n                           infrastructure is missing. There is no commercial element involved so far as the\n                           defendants are concerned. It may be that the activity of plaintiff, being a builder, is\n                           commercial, but at the same time it is purely a private activity so far as the defendants\n                           are concerned. Considering the pleadings of the present case and the recitals of\n                           agreement between the parties, it is clear and evident that the agreement executed is\n                           purely a private contract for reconstruction of a residential building and does not fall\n                           within the definition of commercial dispute under <a href=\"/doc/19189721/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 2(1)(c)(vi)</a> of the Act of\n                           2015.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\">                                   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"3777245\" id=\"span_42\">19.
