Our aforesaid view is fortified on a different reasoning as\n\nwell. If we examine <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 34</a> of the Act of 1996, it has two\n\nparts. Part (a) deals with grounds where a &quot;party making an\n\napplication furnishes proof&quot;. Whereas, part (b) deals with where\n\n&quot;the Court finds&quot;. Thus, even if no ground is taken in a petition\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 34</a> of the 1996 Act, if the Court finds that the\n\naward is in respect of subject matter incapable of arbitration by\n\noperation of law; the court is duty bound to set it aside under\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                       A.A.

Thus, even if a party assailing an arbitral award has not\n\ntaken a ground in its <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 34</a> petition, the Court under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/549389/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 34 (2)(b)(i)</a> of the Act of 1996 is obligated to set aside\n\nan award, which under the law in force, is not capable of\n\narbitration.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1625415\" id=\"span_24\">27.
