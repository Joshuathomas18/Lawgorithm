The petitioner has further prayed to issue a writ, order or direction in the nature of mandamus commanding opposite party no.1, Lucknow Nagar Nigam, to grant permission to the petitioner to transfer his plot on lease without requiring payment of any labhansh which is being illegally demanded by the Nagar Nigam.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">2.\tThe brief facts giving rise to filing of the present writ petition are that on the request of the petitioner a plot bearing no.275 in Eldeco Green, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Nagar Scheme, located in Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, of the Lucknow Nagar Nigam was leased out in favour of the petitioner for a premium of Rs.3,28,053/- only. The area of the plot was 298.27 sq. meter on the road having width of 7 meters only in all including road patari vide lease deed dated 24.09.1999. The petitioner requested the authorities concerned to accord their permission to transfer the aforesaid plot to another person vide letter dated 31.12.2013 but the respondent no.1 in an illegal and arbitrary manner issued a letter dated 11.02.2014 to the petitioner whereby Rs.45,21,771/- had been asked from the petitioner as labhansh for granting him permission to transfer his plot to another person. The petitioner has also submitted that in the lease deed the width of the road has been narrated as 24 meters while it is only 7 meter and this could be verified after taking actual measurement of the plot subsequently by the petitioner after 14 years of executing the lease deed.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">3.\tThe main contention of learned counsel for the petitioner relates to condition as laid down in the lease deed at page no.6 which is as follows:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">The lessee shall not be entitled to make any sub division of the said demised premises or to transfer or assign it in parts, though the whole plot as laid out and leased by the lessor may be transferred with previous consent of the lessor in writing on payment of 40% of the increase of market rate than premium period and in case the lessee, him/her assignee or transferee makes any such assignment or transfer all his rights, without first paying the arrears of rent due from him/her to the lessor, such assignee or transferee shall be assignment or transfer.\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">4.\tLearned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the condition as laid down and mentioned above is totally arbitrary, unreasonable, unfair and also against the constitutional provisions.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_7\">5.\tLearned counsel for the respondents has submitted that the petitioner was allotted and leased out residential plot as mentioned above in Eldeco Green, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow, containing the boundaries as 24 meter wide road on north side. The petitioner has concealed this fact by not filing the copy of the lay out plan which the respondents have annexed with the counter affidavit. After receiving the application of the petitioner for transfer of the plot, the Nagar Nigam processed the matter as per prevalent circle rate fixed by the District Magistrate, Lucknow, as per terms and conditions laid down in the lease deed and after deducting the amount  deposited while execution of the lease deed, 40% profit (labhansh) amounting to Rs.45,21,771/- was required to be deposited by the petitioner and as such the same was communicated to the petitioner vide letter dated 11.02.2014.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">6.\tWe have gone through the terms and conditions of the lease deed, which has been annexed as Annexure 2 to the writ petition in which paragraph 1 at page 3 says that lessor does hereby demise into the lessee all that part of the land with its advantages and disabilities hidden or obvious, containing by measurement 298.27 sq. meter situated in Rafi Ahmad Kidwai Nagar, Gomti Nagar, Lucknow area ad-measuring the width of the road as contained in the lease deed with further condition to uphold the same for a term of 30 years with a right to renewal to two more periods of 30 years each, the rent being enhanceable at each renewal to 50% of the rent payable during the period  immediately preceding the revision with early rent of Rs.3280.53, 1% of the premium of amount of plot, the rent being payable by yearly payments on the first day of April in each year at the office of the Nagar Nigam ...... provided that only one dwelling house shall be built on the demised plot of land and the lessee shall not, without previous consent in writing of the lessor, erect or suffer to be erected on any part of the demised premises and building structure other than and except the building hereby covenanted to be erected with further condition that the lessee shall not be entitled to make any sub division of the demised premises or to transfer or assign it in parts, though the whole plot as laid out and leased by the lessor, may be transferred with previous consent of the lessor in writing on payment of 40% of the increase of market rate than premium period and in case the lessee, him/her assignee or transferee makes any such assignment or transfer all his rights, without first paying the arrears of rent due from him/her to the lessor, such assignee or transferee shall be assignment or transfer and the lessee shall within five years from the date of registration of this deed, start and completely finish the construction of dwelling house upon the demised premises and in case of failure to do so, the lessor shall be charging surcharge @ 2% per annum of the premium. On page 10 of the deed the width of the road in north side has been mentioned as 24 meter, which has been duly signed by the petitioner. Through perusal of the deed it is clear that road measuring 24 meters in front of the petitioner&#x27;s plot has been shown in the lease deed as well as in the lay out plan and on the spot 24 meters road is in existence. It has been narrated by learned counsel for the respondents that in front of the petitioner&#x27;s plot, road measuring 12 meters plus divider is in existence and across the divider 12 meter road has not been constructed as across the road on the southern side the M/s Ansal Housing and Construction Limited was to develop the said road and M/s Eldeco Housing and Industries Limited has developed 12 meter road on its side as license was granted to both the construction companies by Nagar Nigam for developing plot and houses on the said land. The 24 meter road existing on the lay out plan is in between the land allotted to M/s Eldeco and M/s Ansal. Both the construction companies were to construct 12-12 meter road on their sides and for this agreement was executed between the Nagar Nigam, Lucknow and both the construction companies. M/s Ansal started the development work but due to dispute arose by the army, M/s Ansal stopped the development work and the Nagar Nigam initiated the cancellation proceedings against the license given to M/s Ansal.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.\tLearned counsel for the respondents has further submitted that the lease was granted in favour of the petitioner for developing residential plots and it has been specifically mentioned in the lease deed that at the time of transfer of plot/house 40% profit would be payable to Nagar Nigam and the plot can only be used for residential purpose and should not be used for commercial purpose.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">8.\tLearned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that government orders issued in the years 1991 and 1992 prohibit for taking any labhansh while learned counsel for the respondents has submitted that the lease deed was executed in favour of the petitioner in the year 1999. After the petitioner has given his consent for terms and conditions of the lease deed, the lease deed was duly executed between Nagar Nigam and the petitioner. Thus, the provisions of the government orders as mentioned by the petitioner would not be applicable on the present lease deed and the Nagar Nigam is not bound by the said government orders. The impugned letter dated 11.02.2014 has been issued by the respondents to the petitioner in accordance with the terms and conditions of the lease deed and there is no illegality in the demand, which is in accordance with the conditions of the agreement. The petitioner has also challenged the letter dated 09.04.2014 issued by Nagar Nigam. Learned counsel for the respondents has submitted that the government orders issued from time to time were duly considered by the Municipal Commissioner while passing the order dated 28.03.2014 and the Municipal Commissioner while deciding the representation has held that the petitioner has to pay 40% of the amount as per the terms and conditions of the lease deed. These terms and conditions are applicable only on those lease holders who have sought permission for transfer of their leased plots to third person because they are using the plots for commercial purposes. Property of the Nagar Nigam or the public property  can never be permitted to be used for commercial purpose. It has also been contended by learned counsel for the respondents that the lease holders are bound by the terms and conditions of the lease deed and the petitioner has no right to challenge any terms and conditions after belated period of 15 years.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_11\">9.\tWhile filing the rejoinder affidavit to the counter affidavit, learned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that at the time of execution of the lease deed, Nagar Nigam had presented printed proforma of the lease deed for grant of lease  to the petitioner for signing which he had signed believing  the correctness of the contents of the lease deed as the Nagar Nigam is a Public Authority and a statutory Corporation. Moreover, the petitioner was not in a bargaining capacity and had only the choice of either to accept the draft lease deed as presented  to him and sign the terms of the agreement on the dotted line or leave the land itself.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">10.\tLearned counsel for the respondents has submitted that the petitioner as per facts narrated in the opening paragraph of the affidavit had deposed to be a senior advocate in the High Court of Judicature at Lucknow Bench, Lucknow and a senior practitioner and thus the version that he had simply put his signature is not acceptable.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">11.\tLearned counsel for the petitioner has further submitted that Nagar Nigam has been guilty of misrepresenting the facts and playing fraud on the petitioner by giving totally false facts regarding width of the road.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">12.\tLearned counsel for the respondents has submitted that the land was leased out in favour of the petitioner only for residential purpose and not for commercial purpose. If it was the intention of the petitioner to take the land on lease  on rental value and to sell it to third party and to use as commercial then he had to follow the terms and conditions of the lease. If there are certain fraud or misrepresentation committed by any of the party the agreement is said to be void or voidable and subject to decision of the Court and petitioner is at liberty to file a suit in a court of competent jurisdiction. The respondent Nagar Nigam is not compelling the petitioner to either transfer the land or to pay the amount as stated in the letter but if the land is not used in accordance with the terms and conditions as mentioned in the lease deed then the consequence as laid down in the lease deed will follow.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">13.\tLearned counsel for the petitioner has submitted that the act of signing the agreement in these circumstances does not preclude the petitioner from challenging the validity of such false, arbitrary and illegal conditions. It has been further submitted that the petitioner&#x27;s signatures were obtained by the Nagar Nigam by concealing the fact that the State Government had already banned the realization of said labhansh.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">14.\tLearned counsel for the respondents has submitted that Civil Misc. Application No.57397 of 2015 for granting permission to pay the amount was submitted before this Court and this Court vide order dated 11.6.2015 had permitted the petitioner to deposit the amount as demanded by Nagar Nigam which shall be subject to further orders of this Court. The order dated 11.06.2015 is reproduced below:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">&quot;Heard Dr. Ashok Nigam, Advcoate, the petitioner who appears in person and Sri Shailendra Singh Chauhan appearing for Lucknow Nagar Nigam.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">This application has been moved by the petitioner seeking permission to deposit the amount of profit share i.e. Rs. 45,21,771- as demanded by Lucknow Nagar Nigam.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">The petitioner is ready to deposit the aforesaid amount, subject to further orders of the Court. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">Sri Shailendra Singh Chauhan appearing for Nagar Nigam, however, submits that by now the amount of profit share has swollen to Rs. 52,37,630/- in view of the revised circle rate. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">Since the demand has been made for an amount of Rs. 45,21,771/- and the petitioner wishes to deposit the amount, we permit him to deposit the same, which shall be accepted by Nagar Nigam. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">The deposit so made, of course, shall be subject to further orders of the Court. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">The question regarding enhancement of the amount shall be adjudicated upon at the time of final hearing of writ petition.\n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">The application stands disposed of accordingly. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">List the petition in the month of July, 2015.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_17\">15.\tIn light of above facts, learned counsel for the respondents has submitted that the petition has become infructuous because the amount has already been deposited by the petitioner but since the above permission was subject to further orders of this Court, the writ petition requires to be decided on merits.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_18\">16.\tBy filing short counter affidavit on behalf of opposite party no.2 it has been submitted that the petitioner while claiming the relief has relied upon the order dated 08.03.1991 which was issued by the Department of Housing and Urban Planning, Anubhag-5 which is separate entity/department to the answering opposite party/Department of Nagar Vikas, U.P and thus the petitioner is required to implead the Department of Housing and Urban Planning, U.P as necessary party. The respondents have further submitted that the order dated 08.03.1991 is firstly not applicable in the case pertaining to Lucknow Nagar Nigam and secondly the lease deed was executed in the year 1999 and the terms and condition which are mentioned in the lease deed are applicable between the parties and have binding effect. The order issued in the year 1991 has not relevance because it is neither applicable on Nagar Nigam nor was part of the lease agreement.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_19\">17.\tLearned counsel for the respondents has submitted that the terms and conditions as laid down in the deed which have been reduced in writing are binding on the contracting party and Court can not by means of writ jurisdiction either add anything or subtract anything.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">18.\tWhile dealing with the matter relating to the agreement or contract between the parties, Court can neither add anything nor subtract anything from the terms and conditions as laid down in the agreement dealing with the matter of the parties.  ( Court cannot add or subtract anything in the terms of the agreement)\n \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">19.\t\tGenerally it would not be proper to intervene with the contractual matters. The parameters of the Court&#x27;s power have been analyzed by the Supreme Court in Commissioner of Income-tax, Bombay &amp; Ors,. Vs. Mahindra &amp; Mahindra Ltd. &amp; Ors., AIR 1984 SC 1182. We reproduce paragraph-11 of the said judgment-:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"884550\" id=\"span_1\">&quot;By now, the parameters of the Court&#x27;s power of judicial review of administrative or executive action or decision and the grounds on which the Court can interfere with the same are well settled and it would be redundant to recapitulate the whole catena of decisions of this Court commencing from Barium Chemicals, 1966 Supp SCR 311: (AIR 1967 SC 295) case on the point. Indisputably, it is a settled position that if the action or decision is perverse or is such that no reasonable body of persons, properly informed, could come to, or has been arrived at by the authority misdirecting itself by adopting a wrong approach, or has been influenced by irrelevant or extraneous matters the Court would be justified in interfering with the same. This Court in one of its later decisions in <a href=\"/doc/884550/\" id=\"a_2\">Smt. Shalini Soni Vs. Union of India</a>, (1981) 1 SCR 962; (AIR 1981 SC 431), has observed thus: &quot;It is an unwritten rule of the law, constitutional and administrative, that whenever a decision-making function is entrusted to the subjective satisfaction of a statutory functionary, there is an implicit obligation to apply his mind to pertinent and proximate matters only, eschewing the irrelevant and the remote&quot;. Suffice it to say that the following passage appearing at pages 285-86 in Prof. de Smith&#x27;s treatise &#x27;&#x27;Judicial Review of Administrative Action&#x27; (4th Edn.) succinctly summarises the several principles formulated by the Courts in that behalf thus: &quot;The authority in which a discretion is vested can be compelled to exercise that discretion, but not to exercise it in any particular manner. In general, a discretion must be exercised only by the authority to which it is committed. That authority must genuinely address itself to the matter before it: it must not act under the dictation of another body or disable itself from exercising a discretion in each individual case. In the purported exercise of its discretion it must not do what it has been forbidden to do, nor must it do what it has not been authorised to do. It must act in good faith, must have regard to all relevant considerations, must not be swayed by irrelevant considerations, must not seek to promote purposes alien to the letter or to the spirit of the legislation that gives it power to act, and must not act arbitrarily or capriciously. Nor where a judgment must be made that certain facts exist can a discretion be validly exercised on the basis of an erroneous assumption about those facts. These several principles can conveniently be grouped in two main categories; failure to exercise a discretion, and excess or abuse of discretionary power. The two classes are not, however, mutually exclusive. Thus, discretion may be improperly fettered because irrelevant considerations have been taken into account; and where an authority hands over its discretion to another body it acts ultra vires. Nor, is it possible to differentiate with precision the grounds of invalidly contained within each category&quot;.</span>      \n</blockquote> \n\t       \t\n \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">20.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1901448\" id=\"span_2\">In <a href=\"/doc/1901448/\" id=\"a_3\">State of U.P. &amp; Ors., Vs. Renusagar Power Co. &amp; Ors</a>,. AIR 1988 SC 1737 it was held that exercise of administrative power will be set aside if there is a manifest error in the exercise of such power or the exercise of the power is manifestly arbitrary.</span> \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">21.\tThe famous &quot;Wednesbury Case&quot; Associated Provincial Picture Houses Ltd. Us. Wednesbury Corp. (1947) 2 All ER 680 (CA) is considered to be the landmark in so far as the basic principles relating to judicial review of administrative or statutory direction are concerned. We quote a passage from the judgment of Lord Greene which is as follows:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">&quot;It is true that discretion must be exercised reasonably. Now what does that mean? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology used in relation to exercise of statutory discretions often use the word &#x27;&#x27;unreasonable&#x27; in a rather comprehensive sense. It has frequently been used and is frequently used as a general description of the things that must not be done. For instance, a person entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in law. He must call his own attention to the matters, which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his consideration matters, which are irrelevant to what he has to consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is said, to be acting &#x27;&#x27;unreasonably&#x27;. Similarly, there may be something so absurd that no sensible person could even dream that it lay within the powers of the authority...... . In another, it is taking into consideration extraneous matters. It is unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith; and in fact, all these things run into one another.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">22.\tThe principles of judicial review of administrative action were further summarized in 1985 by Lord Diplock in Council of Civil Service Unions Vs. Minister for the Civil Service 1984 (3) Al. ER. 935, (commonly known as CCSU case) as illegality, procedural impropriety and irrationality. He said more grounds could in future become available, including the doctrine of proportionality which was a principle followed by certain other members of the European Economic Community. Lord Diplock observed in this case as follows:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">&quot;....... Judicial review has I think, developed to a stage today when, without reiterating any analysis of the steps by which the development has come about, one can conveniently classify under three heads the grounds on which administrative action is subject to control by judicial review. The first ground I would call &#x27;&#x27;illegality&#x27;, the second &#x27;&#x27;irrationality&#x27; and the third &#x27;&#x27;procedural impropriety&#x27;. That is not to say that further development on a case-by-case basis may not in course of time add further grounds. I have in mind particularly the possible adoption in the future of the principle of &#x27;&#x27;proportionality&#x27; which is recognized in the administrative law of several of our fellow members of the European Economic Community.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_25\">Lord Diplock explained &#x27;&#x27;irrationality&#x27; as follows:\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">&quot;By &#x27;&#x27;irrationality&#x27; I mean what can by now be succinctly referred to as &#x27;&#x27;Wednesbury unreasonableness&#x27;. It applies to a decision which is so outrageous in its defiance of logic or of accepted moral standards that no sensible person who had applied his mind to the question to be decided could have arrived at it.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">23.\tIn Union of India &amp; Anr,.

Normally speaking, the decision to accept the tender or award the contract is reached by process of negotiations through several tiers. More often than not, such decisions are made qualitatively by experts. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">(5) The Government must have freedom of contract. In other words, a fairplay in the joints is a necessary concomitant for an administrative body functioning in an administrative sphere or quasi administrative sphere.

The wide sweep of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_21\">Article 14</a> and the requirement of every State action qualifying for its validity on this touchstone irrespective of the field of activity of the State is an accepted tenet. The basic requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 14</a> is fairness in action by the State, and non-arbitrariness in essence and substance is the heartbeat of fair play. Actions are amenable, in the panorama of judicial review only to the extent that the State must act validly for a discernible reason, not whimsically for any ulterior purpose. The meaning and true import and concept of arbitrariness is more easily visualized than precisely defined. A question whether the impugned action is arbitrary or not is to be ultimately answered on the facts and circumstances of a given case. A basic and obvious test to apply in such cases is to see whether there is any discernible principle emerging from the impugned action and if so, does it really satisfy the test of reasonableness. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">16.

What is necessary in order to pass the test of permissible classification under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_36\">Article 14</a> is that the classification must not be &quot;arbitrary, artificial or evasive&quot; but must be based on some real and substantial distinction bearing a just and reasonable relation to the object sought to be achieved by the legislature...........Another rule of equal importance is that laws relating to economic activities should be viewed with greater latitude than laws touching civil rights such as freedom of speech, religion etc. It has been said by no less a person than Holmes, J., that the legislature should be allowed some play in the joints, because it has to deal with complex problems which do not admit of solution through any doctrinaire or straight jacket formula and this is particularly true in case of legislation dealing with economic matters, where, having regard to the nature of the problems required to be dealt with greater play in the joints has to be allowed to the legislature. The Court should feel more inclined to give judicial deference to legislative judgment in the field of economic regulation than in other areas where fundamental human rights are involved. ........The Court must always remember that &quot;legislation is directed to practical problems, that the economic mechanism is highly sensitive and complex, that many problems are singular and contingent, that laws are not abstract propositions and do not relate to abstract units and are not to be measured by abstract symmetry&quot; that exact wisdom and nice adaption of remedy are not always possible and that &quot;judgment is largely a prophecy based on meagre and uninterpreted experience&quot;. Every legislation particularly in economic matters is essentially empiric and it is based on experimentation or what one may call trial and error method and therefore it cannot provide for all possible situations or anticipate all possible abuse. There may be crudities and inequities in complicated experimental economic legislation but on that account alone it cannot be struck down as invalid.............There may even be possibilities of abuse, but that too cannot of itself be a ground for invalidating the legislation, because it is not possible for any legislature to anticipate as if by some divine prescience, distortions and abuses of its legislation which may be made by those subject to its provisions and to provide against such distortions and abuses. Indeed, howsoever great may be the care bestowed on its framing, it is difficult to conceive of a legislation which is not capable of being abused by perverted human ingenuity. The Court must therefore adjudge the constitutionality of such legislation by the generality of its provisions and not by its crudities or inequities or by the possibilities of abuse of any of its provisions. If any crudities, inequities or possibilities of abuse come to light, the legislature can always step in and enact suitable amendatory legislation. That is the essence of pragmatic approach which must guide and inspire the legislature in dealing with complex economic issues.

Vs. Wednesbury Corporation, (1947) 2 All ER 680 (CA) is considered to be a landmark in so far as the basic principles relating to judicial review of administrative or statutory actions are concerned. We quote a passage from the judgment of Lord Greene which is as follows:-\n</p> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">&quot;It is true that discretion must be exercised reasonably. Now what does that mean? Lawyers familiar with the phraseology used in relation to exercise of statutory discretions often use the word &#x27;&#x27;unreasonable&#x27; in a rather comprehensive sense. It has frequently been used and is frequently used as a general description of the things that must not be done. For instance, a person entrusted with a discretion must, so to speak, direct himself properly in law. He must call his own attention to the matters, which he is bound to consider. He must exclude from his consideration matters, which are irrelevant to what he has to consider. If he does not obey those rules, he may truly be said, and often is said, to be acting &#x27;&#x27;unreasonably&#x27;. Similarly, there may be something so absurd that no sensible person could even dream that it lay within the powers of the authority....... In another, it is taking into consideration extraneous matters. It is unreasonable that it might almost be described as being done in bad faith; and in fact, all these things run into one another.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">52.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"110957682\" id=\"span_34\">In People&#x27;s Union for <a href=\"/doc/110957682/\" id=\"a_53\">Civil Liberties &amp; Anr.

The reason is that whereas in cases where the decision is based on subjective satisfaction if some of the reasons turn out to be irrelevant or invalid, it would be impossible for a superior Court to find out which of the reasons, relevant or irrelevant, valid or invalid, had brought about such satisfaction. But in a case where the conclusion is based on objective facts and evidence, such a difficulty would not arise. If it is found that there was legal evidence before the Tribunal, even if some of it was irrelevant, a superior Court would not interfere if the finding can be sustained on the rest of the evidence. The reason is that in a writ petition for certiorari the superior Court does not sit in appeal, but exercises only supervisory jurisdiction, and therefore, does not enter into the question of sufficiency of evidence.&quot; (Emphasis added)\n \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_66\">57.\tIt has been said from time and again by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court that a party cannot be permitted to dispute the contractual obligations by invoking the extraordinary writ jurisdiction. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1893286\" id=\"span_39\">In <a href=\"/doc/1893286/\" id=\"a_58\">Bareilly Development Authority &amp; anr Vs.

Learned counsel has rightly questioned the maintainability of the writ petition. The interpretation and implementation of a clause in a contract cannot be the subject-matter of a writ petition. Whether the contract envisages actual payment or not is a question of construction of contract. If a term of contract is violated, ordinarily the remedy is not the writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_102\">Article 226.</a> We are also unable to agree with the observations of the High Court that the contractor was seeking enforcement of a statutory contract. A contract would not become statutory simply because it is for construction of a public utility and it has been awarded by a statutory body. We are also unable to agree with the observation of the High Court that since the obligations imposed by the contract on the contracting parties come within the purview of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_103\">Contract Act</a>, that would not make the contract statutory. Clearly, the High Court fell into an error in coming to the conclusion that the contract in question was statutory in nature. \n</blockquote> \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">\tA statute may expressly or impliedly confer power on a statutory body to enter into contracts in order to enable it to discharge its functions. Dispute arising out of the terms of such contracts or alleged breaches have to be settled by the ordinary principles of law of contract. The fact that one of the parties to the agreement is a statutory or public body will not by itself affect the principles to be applied. The disputes about the meaning of a covenant in a contract or its enforceability have to be determined according to the usual principles of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_104\">Contract Act</a>. Every act of a statutory body need not necessarily involve an exercise of statutory power. Statutory bodies, like private parties, have power to contract or deal with property. Such activities may not raise any issue of public law. In the present case, it has not been shown how the contract is statutory. The contract between the parties is in the realm of private law. It is not a statutory contract. The disputes relating to interpretation of the terms and conditions of such a contract could not have been agitated in a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India. That is a matter for adjudication by a civil court or in arbitration if provided for in the contract. Whether any amount is due and if so, how much and refusal of the appellant to pay it is justified or not, are not the matters which could have been agitated and decided in a writ petition.&quot; (emphasis supplied)\n \n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\">82.\t<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"9701717\" id=\"span_70\">In <a href=\"/doc/9701717/\" id=\"a_106\">State of Jammu &amp; Kashmir Vs.

Failure to observe requirements by statutory bodies is enforced by courts by declaring (action) in violation of rules and regulations  to be void.

That is a matter for adjudication by a civil court or in arbitration if provided for in the contract.... The contractor should have relegated to other remedies.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_122\">113.\tIt is evident from the above, that generally the court should not exercise its writ jurisdiction to enforce the contractual obligation. The primary purpose of a writ of mandamus, is to protect and establish rights and to impose a corresponding imperative duty existing in law. It is designed to promote justice (ex debito justiceiae). The grant or refusal of the writ is at the discretion of the court. The writ cannot be granted unless it is established that there is an existing legal right of the applicant, or an existing duty of the Respondent. Thus, the writ does not lie to create or to establish a legal right, but to enforce one that is already established. While dealing with a writ petition, the court must exercise discretion, taking into consideration a wide variety of circumstances, inter-alia, the facts of the case, the exigency that warrants such exercise of discretion, the consequences of grant or refusal of the writ, and the nature and extent of injury that is likely to ensue by such grant or refusal.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_123\">114.\tHence, discretion must be exercised by the court on grounds of public policy, public interest and public good. The writ is equitable in nature and thus, its issuance is governed by equitable principles. Refusal of relief must be for reasons which would lead to injustice. The prime consideration for the issuance of the said writ is, whether or not substantial justice will be promoted. Furthermore, while granting such a writ, the court must make every effort to ensure from the averments of the writ petition, whether there exist proper pleadings. In order to maintain the writ of mandamus, the first and foremost requirement is that the petition must not be frivolous, and must be filed in good faith. Additionally, the applicant must make a demand which is clear, plain and unambiguous. It must be made to an officer having the requisite authority to perform the act demanded. Furthermore, the authority against whom mandamus is issued, should have rejected the demand earlier. Therefore, a demand and its subsequent refusal, either by words, or by conduct, are necessary to satisfy the court that the opposite party is determined to ignore the demand of the applicant with respect to the enforcement of his legal right. However, a demand may not be necessary when the same is manifest from the facts of the case, that is, when it is an empty formality, or when it is obvious that the opposite party would not consider the demand.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_124\">115.\tLearned counsel for the respondents has relied upon the <a href=\"/doc/53053983/\" id=\"a_158\">Section 537</a> of the Uttar Pradesh Municipal Corporation Act regarding power of the State Government with regard to corporations and <a href=\"/doc/831280/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 2</a> of U.P.

This privilege arises because it is the Government which trading with the public and the democratic form of Government demands equality and absence of arbitrariness and discrimination in such transactions. Privilege is a form of liberty as opposed to a duty. When public element is involved in the activities of the Government, then there should be fairness and equality. If the State does enter into a contract, it must do so fairly without discrimination and without unfair procedure. Exclusion of a member of the public from dealing, prevents him from entering into lawful contractual relations and discriminates him in favour of other people. Though the State is entitled to impose reasonable conditions but arbitrary conditions prevents entering into contractual relations with the State. The individual is entitled to fair and equal treatment with others. A duty to act fairly can be interpreted as meaning a duty to observe certain aspects of rules of natural justice. \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_132\">123.\tIn Saghir Ahmad v.

The Government, therefore, cannot anchor its role as a private person. The exercise of the power or discrimination to award contract etc. must be structured by rational, relevant and non-discriminatory standards or norms. In Kasturi Lal Lakshmi Reddy v.

It was further held that law has to grow in order to satisfy the needs of the fast changing society and keep abreast with the economic developments taking place in the country. As new situations arise the law has to be evolved in order to meet the challenge of such new situations. Law cannot afford to remain static. The Court has to evolve new principles and lay down new norms which arise in a highly industrialised economy, Therefore, when new challenges are thrown open, the law must grow as a social engineering to meet the challenges and every endeavour should be made to cope with the contemporary demands to meet socio-economic challenges under rule of law and have to be met either by discarding the old and unsuitable or adjusting legal system to the changing socio-economic scenario.

India Oil Corporation MANU/SC/0191/1990MANU/SC/0191/1990 : [1990]1SCR818 , it was held that the State when acting in its executive power, enters into contractual relations with the individual, <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_190\">Article 14</a> would be applicable to the exercise of the power. The action of the State or its instrumentality can be checked under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_191\">Article 14.</a> Their action must be subject to rule of law. If the governmental action even in the matter of entering or not entering into contracts, fails to satisfy the test of reasonableness, the same would be unreasonable. Rule of reason and rule against arbitrariness and discrimination, rules of fair play, natural justice are part of the rule of law applicable in situation or action by State/instrumentality in dealing with citizens. Even though the rights of the citizens, therefore, are in the nature of contractual rights, the manner, the method and motive of a decision of entering or not entering into a contract, are subject to judicial review on the touchstone of relevance and reasonableness, fair play and natural justice, equality and non-discrimination. It is well settled that there can be &quot;malice in law&quot;. It was also further held that whatever be the act of the public authority in such monopoly or semi-monopoly, it must be subject to rule of law and must be supported by reasons and it should meet the test of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_192\">Article 14.</a>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_137\">128.\tIn the sphere of contractual relations the State, its instrumentality, public authorities or those whose acts bear insignia of public element, action to public duty or obligation are enjoined to act in a manner i.e. fair, just and equitable, after taking objectively all the relevant options into consideration and in a manner that is reasonable, relevant and germane to effectuate the purpose for public good and in general public interest and it must not take any irrelevant or irrational factors into consideration or arbitrary in its decision. Duty to act fairly is pah of fair procedure envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_193\">Articles 14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1199182/\" id=\"a_194\">21.</a> Every activity of the public authority or those under public duty or obligation must be informed by reason and guided by the public interest.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_138\">129.\tIn Kumari Shrilekha Vidyarthi v. State of U.P. MANU/SC/0504/1991MANU/SC/0504/1991 : AIR 1991 SC 537 , the Court in paragraph 22 pointed out that the private parties are concerned only with their personal interest but the public authority are expected to act for public good and in public interest. The impact of every action is also on public interest. It imposes public law obligation and impress with that character, the contracts made by the State or its instrumentality. &quot;It is a different matter that the scope of judicial review in respect of disputes falling within the domain of contractual obligations may be more limited and in doubtful cases the parties may be relegated to the adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies provided for adjudication of purely contractual disputes. However, to the extent, challenge is made on the ground of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_195\">Article 14</a> by alleging that the impugned act is arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, the fact that the dispute also falls within the domain of contractual obligations would not relieve the State of its obligation to comply with the basic requirements of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_196\">Article 14.</a> To this extent, the obligation is of a public character invariably in every case irrespective of there being any other right or obligation in addition thereto. An additional contractual obligation cannot divest the claimant of the guarantee under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_197\">Article 14</a> of non-arbitrariness at the hands of the State in any of its actions&quot;. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"298443\" id=\"span_121\">In <a href=\"/doc/298443/\" id=\"a_198\">Food Corporation of India v.

Every legitimate expectation is a relevant factor requiring due consideration in a fair decision-making process&quot;.</span> In Sterling Computers Ltd. v. M &amp; N Publications Ltd. MANU/SC/0439 /1993MANU/SC/0439/1993 : AIR 1996 SC 51 , it was held that even in commercial contracts where there is a public element, it is necessary that relevant considerations are taken into account and the irrelevant consideration discarded. In Union of India v. M/s. Graphic Industries Co., MANU/SC/0086/1995MANU/SC/0086/1995 : (1994) 5 SCC 398: 1994 AIR SCW 4617), this Court held that even in contractual matters public authorities have to act fairly; and if they fail to do so approach under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_199\">Article 226</a> would always be permissible because that would amount to &#x27;violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_200\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1435269\" id=\"span_122\">The ratio in <a href=\"/doc/1435269/\" id=\"a_201\">General Assurance Society Ltd. v.

The arms of the High Court is not shackled with technical rules or of Procedure. The actions of the State, its instrumentality, any public authority or person whose actions bear insignia of public law element or public character are amendable to judicial review and the validity of such an action would be tested on the anvil of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_202\">Article 14.</a></span> \n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"386457\" id=\"span_123\">130.\tThe applicant had herself reprobated her right if there was any right in his favour against the respondents.

Where one knowingly accepts the benefits of a contract, or conveyance, or of an order, he is estopped from denying the validity of, or the binding effect of such contract, or conveyance, or order upon himself.

Thus, contract being a creature of an agreement between two or more parties, has to be interpreted giving literal meanings unless, there is some ambiguity therein. The contract is to be interpreted giving the actual meaning to the words contained in the contract and it is not permissible for the court to make a new contract, however is reasonable, if the parties have not made it themselves. It is to be interpreted in such a way that its terms may not be varied. The contract has to be interpreted without giving any outside aid. The terms of the contract have to be construed strictly without altering the nature of the contract, as it may affect the interest of either of the parties adversely.

The purpose of a contract is the interests, objectives, values, policy that the contract is designed to actualise. It comprises joint intent of the parties. Every such contract expresses the autonomy of the contractual parties&#x27; private will. It creates reasonable, legally protected expectations between the parties and reliance on its results. Consistent with the character of purposive interpretation, the court is required to determine the ultimate purpose of a contract primarily by the joint intent of the parties at the time the contract so formed. It is not the intent of a single party; it is the joint intent of both parties and the joint intent of the parties is to be discovered from the entirety of the contract and the circumstances surrounding its formation. As is stated in Anson&#x27;s Law of Contract, &quot;a basic principle of the Common Law of Contract is that the parties are free to determine for themselves what primary obligations they will accept...Today, the position is seen in a different light. Freedom of contract is generally regarded as a reasonable, social, ideal only to the extent that equality of bargaining power between the contracting parties can be assumed and no injury is done to the interests of the community at large.&quot; The Court assumes &quot;that the parties to the contract are reasonable persons who seek to achieve reasonable results, fairness and efficiency...In a contract between the joint intent of the parties and the intent of the reasonable person, joint intent trumps, and the Judge should interpret the contract accordingly.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_143\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"197724537\" id=\"span_126\">134.\t Learned counsel for the respondents has submitted that it is no where mentioned that the land of Nagar Nigma shall be permitted to be used for commercial purpose by any lease holder in violation of terms and conditions of the lease deed.

The simple matter involved in the present writ petition is a lease deed which contains certain terms and conditions and were duly accepted and signed by the executing parties.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_147\">138.\tWe examined the lease deed in light of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_214\">Contract Act</a> where <a href=\"/doc/447653/\" id=\"a_215\">Section 10</a> of the Act provides that &quot;All agreements are contracts if they are made by the free consent of parties competent to contract, for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void. Consequently agreements which are not for a lawful consideration and with a lawful object, and are not hereby expressly declared to be void, are not contract, i.e. an agreement enforceable under the law.  <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_216\">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act however lays down what consideration and objects are lawful, and what not. Nothing has been shown by the petitioner that there was no free consent or the object of the agreement was not lawful or the agreement was forbidden by any law which would defeat the provisions of law or is fraudulent. Even if the matter comes within the purview of fraud or misrepresentation then the petitioner has remedy to file a case before the court of competent jurisdiction for cancellation of the deed. Citation of Ajit Shukla mentioned above is not applicable in the present case because the interpretation of Section 537 has reference to challenging the orders passed by Mukhya Nagar Adhikari in the above referred case. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1644077\" id=\"span_133\">In <a href=\"/doc/1644077/\" id=\"a_217\">ITC Limited vs. State of U.P. and others</a>, as mentioned above, in para 29 of the case, it has been mentioned that when the lease has been granted, executed and registered, when entire premium and other dues have been paid and possession has been delivered, the lessor cannot unilaterally cancel the lease. Here is not the case of cancellation of the lease deed. There is also not a case of violation of any terms and conditions of the lease deed. There is also not a case of interference in the use of land for residential purpose. It is the petitioner who had applied for transfer of the land in question which was alloted to him by way of lease deed and if he moves an application for transfer of the land without being owner, the consent and permission of the owner is required. The terms and conditions of the lease deed require that in case of transfer the lessee/applicant will follow the terms and conditions of the lease deed and pay 40% amount of profit to Nagar Nigam. Thus, the above referred case is not applicable to the present case. It is not a case of mistake of both the parties because <a href=\"/doc/483593/\" id=\"a_218\">Section 20</a> of the Contract Act provides that where both the parties to an agreement are under mistake as to a matter of fact essential to the agreement, the agreement is void. If the statement of the petitioner is taken into account and it is taken as granted to be a mistake of fact then as per <a href=\"/doc/483593/\" id=\"a_219\">Section 20</a> of the Act it is void and no right, title or interest in favour of the petitioner shall accrue and the land will revert back to the owner/Nagar Nigam. <a href=\"/doc/626336/\" id=\"a_220\">Section 21</a> of the Contract Act further provides that a contract is not voidable because it was caused by any mistake as to any law in force. Therefore, having regard to the provisions of the Transfer of Property Act and the Contract Act, a deed or terms of deed cannot be cancelled on the ground that parties were mistaken about the consideration.</span>\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_148\">139.\tLearned counsel for the petitioner has further argued that <a href=\"/doc/631708/\" id=\"a_221\">Article 25</a> of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights envisages that everyone has the right to standard of living adequate for the health and well being of himself and of his family including food, clothing, housing and medical care and necessary social services and the right to security in the event of unemployment, sickness, disability, widowhood, old age or other lack of livelihood in the circumstances beyond his control but learned counsel for the respondents has submitted that this is not the enforceable right. He has further argued that right to social security and protection of the family are integral part of the right to life. Right to social and economic justice is a fundamental right but it does not mean that the land of the Nagar Nigam should be given free of cost. Learned counsel for the respondents has further argued that State has not framed any policy to provide all citizens a land free of cost.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_149\">140.\tLearned counsel for the petitioner has lastly submitted that the Collector has fixed circle rates for different non-agricultural land on the basis of its location on roads of different width. For instance, all land which are located on path way of 7 meter width only, which is less than 9 meter, is at Rs.10,800/- per sq. meter only. He has further submitted that for the sake of argument even if it is said  that labhansh/marginal profit was payable to Nagar Nigam which has been denied by the petitioner, it ought to have been calculated in the category of a plot of Eldeco Green, Rafi Ahmed Kidwai Ward V-code no.0312 for fixing the market rate according to which the market price ought to have been fixed @ Rs.31,200/- per sq. meter. The calculation at above rate for 40% labhansh for 298.27 sq. meter land of the petitioner comes to Rs.35,91,188/- only. He has further submitted that Nagar Nigam has calculated the rate on circle rate fixed by the District Magistrate on 24 meter road @ Rs.39000/- per sq. meter which is calculated as Rs.45,21,791/- which is approximately 9 lakhs more than the calculation made by the petitioner. Vide report as mentioned in the Court&#x27;s order dated 11.06.2015 the amount has been increased as Rs.52,37,630/- which is due to be paid to the respondent/Nagar Nigam and the petitioner is required to pay the same subject to adjustment of amount if any paid.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_150\">141.\tLearned counsel for the respondents has submitted that the lease deed discloses the width of road as 24 meter and the calculation has been made on the basis of circle rate as fixed by the District Magistrate. Thus, the calculation made by the respondents is in accordance with the rate prescribed by the rules and no interference is required under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_222\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.\n</p> \n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_151\">142.\tOn the basis of above, we are of the view that the terms and conditions relating to property in question is governed by the lease deed and the Court cannot interfere in the terms and conditions of the deed. The petition is also not maintainable on the ground of delay and laches. Moreover, the petitioner has prayed vide application mentioned above to pay the amount as required by Nagar Nigam and thus petition has lost its significance at present.
