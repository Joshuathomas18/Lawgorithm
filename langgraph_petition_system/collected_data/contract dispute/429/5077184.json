An agreement was entered into between the\n          THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                      WP-10368-2020\n       Rajkmar Goyal Vs. Municipal Corporation Gwalior\n\npetitioner and the Municipal Corporation, Gwalior and the work\n\norder with regard to three construction works were issued, which\n\nhaves been filed as Annexure P-1 [Collectively]. It is the case of the\n\npetitioner that before issuance of NITs, budget was worked out by\n\nthe Municipal Corporation and it was found that budget is available\n\nfor carrying out the construction work and, therefore, NITs were\n\nissued and the work order was issued. The petitioner thereafter\n\ncompleted his work within time frame work and the technical report\n\nwas also submitted which was to the effect that work performed by\n\nthe petitioner is up to the satisfaction of the authority and was in\n\naccordance with the specifications. Initially, the petitioner submitted\n\nthe first bill in all the three cases and, thereafter, final bill was also\n\nsubmitted but it is the case of the petitioner that neither the first bill\n\nhas been honoured nor the final bill has been honoured and till date,\n\nnot a singly penny has been paid to the petitioner. It is further\n\nsubmitted that the petitioner applied for documents under the RTI to\n\nfind out as to why the payment has not been made. Although the\n\ncopies of the note-sheets have been supplied to the petitioner under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/671631/\" id=\"a_2\">Right to Information Act</a>, but no reason has been assigned as to\n\nwhy the payment has not been made. The note-sheet with regard to\n\nthree different work orders have been placed as Annexures P-2, P-3\n\nand P-4. By referring to the note-sheets Annexures P-2, P-3 and P-4,\n          THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                      WP-10368-2020\n       Rajkmar Goyal Vs. Municipal Corporation Gwalior\n\nit is submitted by the counsel for the petitioner that in all these three\n\ncases, it is specifically mentioned that the work which was done by\n\nthe petitioner was in accordance with the specifications and a\n\nrecommendation was made for releasing the amount. However, the\n\nCommissioner is sitting tight over the recommendation made by the\n\nauthorities and the amount has not been paid. It is further submitted\n\nthat since the budget was available with the respondent authority,\n\ntherefore, they cannot withhold the amount on the ground that budget\n\nis not available. It is further submitted that the act of respondent of\n\nwithholding the amount payable to the petitioner is violative of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1218090/\" id=\"a_3\">Article 19</a> of the Constitution of India because he has been deprived\n\nof his livelihood and due to shortage of fund, he is not in a position\n\nto take further contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">      The respondent has filed its return. It is submitted by the\n\ncounsel for the respondent that one petition has been filed arising\n\nout of three different contracts, therefore, in the light of High\n\nCourt Rules, single petition is not maintainable because provisions of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_4\">Order 2 Rule 3 of CPC</a> are applicable to writ petition also and,\n\ntherefore, the petitioner should have filed three different writ\n\npetitions. Another preliminary objection of the respondent is that as\n\nper Clause 12 of the General Condition of Contract, there is a\n\nDispute Resolution System and the petitioner was required to submit\n          THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                      WP-10368-2020\n       Rajkmar Goyal Vs. Municipal Corporation Gwalior\n\nhis representation before the competent authority within 45 days of\n\nits first occurrence and dispute after 45 days can not be entertained.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">In case, if the dispute is decided by the competent authority, then the\n\npetitioner had a right to file an appeal within 45 days of such a\n\ndecision. Thereafter, the petitioner could have approached the\n\nMadhyastham Adhikaran         Tribunal   under   the   provisions   of\n\nMadhyastham Adhikaran Adhiniyam, 1983. It is submitted that in\n\nspite of the availability of alternative remedy, the petitioner has not\n\navailed the same and filed the present petition in order to over come\n\nthe period of limitation and, therefore, the petition is liable to be\n\ndismissed on this ground also. It is further submitted that in the\n\ncontractual matters, where the disputed question of facts are\n\ninvolved, then the writ petition is not maintainable. It is further\n\nsubmitted that the State Government had amended Rule 15-A of the\n\nM.P. Nagar Palika (Registration of Colonizer, Terms and Conditions)\n\nRules 1998 (for brevity &quot;Rules, 1998&quot;), by which the provision for\n\nregularization of illegal colonies was introduced and as per the\n\nScheme, 50% of the work was to be done out of the funds of the\n\nInstitution and remaining 50% was required to be borne by the\n\nbeneficiaries / inhabitants and the share of inhabitants was to be paid\n\nby the State Government. The validity of provision 15-A of the\n\nRules, 1998 was challenged before this Court in the case of Umesh\n          THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                      WP-10368-2020\n       Rajkmar Goyal Vs. Municipal Corporation Gwalior\n\nKumar Bohare Vs. State of Madhya Pradesh and others (W.P.\n\nNo. 10414/2018) and the Division Bench of this Court by order dated\n\n03.06.2019 held that amended Rule 15-A of the Rules, 1998 is ultra\n\nvires the substantive provision of the Act, and all actions taken there\n\nupon were declared illegal and the competent authority of respective\n\nmunicipalities were directed to initiate action under Section 292E\n\nread with <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 292DA</a> of the Act, 1956 and under Section 339E\n\nread with <a href=\"/doc/262262/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 339DA</a> of the Act, 1961. It is submitted that since\n\nthe provisions of amended Rule 15-A of the Rules, 1998            were\n\ndeclared ultra vires, therefore, the State Government has not\n\nprovided its share of 50% of the total cost. Thus, the respondent\n\ncould not release the amount.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">      Challenging the non-payment of the amount of work done by\n\nthe petitioner, it is submitted by the counsel for the petitioner that\n\nneither in the NIT/agreement/work order, there was any provision\n\nthat 50% of the expenses shall be borne by the State of Madhya\n\nPradesh. If the State of Madhya Pradesh is not releasing its share,\n\nthen it is a dispute between the respondent and the State and the\n\npetitioner cannot be made to suffer because there is no deficiency in\n\nthe work executed by the petitioner and, thus, it cannot be said that\n\nthere is a dispute between the petitioner and the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">      At this stage, it was pointed out by the Court that looking to\n          THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                      WP-10368-2020\n       Rajkmar Goyal Vs. Municipal Corporation Gwalior\n\nthe controversy involved in this case, the State Government also\n\nappears to be a necessary party, therefore, the petitioner may consider\n\nof impleading the State Government as respondent. However, it was\n\nsubmitted by Shri N.K. Gupta, Senior Counsel that since the dispute\n\nis between the State and the respondent and the petitioner has\n\nnothing to do with the said dispute, therefore, the State Government\n\nis not a necessary party.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_12\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1868251\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"27452577\" id=\"span_3\">In order to substantiate his submission, counsel for the\n\npetitioner once again submitted that the fact that the State\n\nGovernment shall bear 50% of the cost was neither mentioned in the\n\nNIT nor in the work order, therefore, any subsequent development,\n\nwhich has taken place, cannot be taken note of for releasing the\n\nlegitimate amount claimed by the petitioner. To buttress his\n\ncontention, counsel for the petitioner has relied upon the judgments\n\npassed by the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/27452577/\" id=\"a_7\">Surya Constructions\n\nVs. State of Uttar Pradesh and others</a> reported in (<a href=\"/doc/1868251/\" id=\"a_8\">2019) 16 SCC\n\n794, Rajasthan State Electricity Board Vs.

No. 1366/2018 arising out of the order\n\ndated 07.09.2018 passed by a Coordinate Bench of this Court in\n\nW.P. No. 19431/2017. It is submitted that when there is no dispute\n\nwith regard to the quality of work executed by the petitioner, then it\n\ncannot be said that there is a dispute warranting the petitioner to\n\napproach the alternative resolution system and thus the contention of\n\nthe respondent that as per Clause 12 of the Agreement, the petitioner\n\nshould have approached the Arbitrator or any other authority\n\nincluding the Madhyastham Adhikaran Tribunal does not apply to the\n\nfacts of the case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">       So far as the question of joinder of multiple causes of action is\n\nconcerned, it is submitted that in the present petition, the respondent,\n\nthe petitioner and the question of law is the same. There is no dispute\n\nwith regard to the factual aspect of the matter. Even otherwise under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_10\">Order 2 Rule 3 of CPC</a>, a plaintiff can join multiple causes of action\n\nin a civil suit and, therefore, it cannot be said that the joinder of three\n\ndifferent causes of action arising out of three different contract is bad\n\nin law. It is further submitted that even otherwise, if it is found that\n\nthe petitioner should have filed different petition for each cause of\n\naction, then the petitioner is ready to pay additional two sets of Court\n\nFee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1091302\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"414125\" id=\"span_5\">Per contra, counsel for the respondent has relied upon the\n          THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                      WP-10368-2020\n       Rajkmar Goyal Vs.

The intendment of\n   the notification in the Official Gazette is that in the\n   case of either grant or withdrawal of exemption the\n   public must come to know of the same. &#x27;Notify&#x27; even\n   according to ordinary dictionary meaning would be &#x27;to\n   take note of, observe; to make known, publish,\n   proclaim; to announce; to give notice to; to inform&#x27;. It\n   would be a mockery of the rule to state that it would\n   suffice the purpose of the notification if the\n   notification is merely printed in the Official Gazette,\n   without making the same available for circulation to\n   the public or putting it on sale to the public. ...

The date of release of the\n   publication is the decisive date to make the notification\n   effective.

It is wide and expansive. The Constitution\n     does not place any fetter on exercise of the extraordinary\n     jurisdiction. It is left to the discretion of the High Court.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_59\">     Therefore, it cannot be laid down as a general proposition\n     of law that in no case the High Court can entertain a writ\n     petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_28\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution to enforce a\n     claim under a life insurance policy. It is neither possible\n     nor proper to enumerate exhaustively the circumstances in\n     which such a claim can or cannot be enforced by filing a\n     writ petition. The determination of the question depends on\n     consideration of several factors like, whether a writ\n     petitioner is merely attempting to enforce his/her\n     contractual rights or the case raises important questions of\n     law and constitutional issues, the nature of the dispute\n     raised; the nature of inquiry necessary for determination of\n     the dispute etc. The matter is to be considered in the facts\n     and circumstances of each case. While the jurisdiction of\n     the High Court to entertain a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_29\">Article\n     226</a> of the Constitution cannot be denied altogether, courts\n     must bear in mind the self-imposed restriction consistently\n     followed by High Courts all these years after the\n     constitutional power came into existence in not\n     entertaining writ petitions filed for enforcement of purely\n     contractual rights and obligations which involve disputed\n     questions of facts. The courts have consistently taken the\n     view that in a case where for determination of the dispute\n     raised, it is necessary to inquire into facts for determination\n     of which it may become necessary to record oral evidence\n     a proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_30\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution, is not\n     the appropriate forum. The position is also well settled that\n          THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                      WP-10368-2020\n       Rajkmar Goyal Vs. Municipal Corporation Gwalior\n\n     if the contract entered between the parties provide an\n     alternate forum for resolution of disputes arising from the\n     contract, then the parties should approach the forum agreed\n     by them and the High Court in writ jurisdiction should not\n     permit them to bypass the agreed forum of dispute\n     resolution. At the cost of repetition it may be stated that in\n     the above discussions we have only indicated some of the\n     circumstances in which the High Court have declined to\n     entertain petitions filed under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_31\">Article 226</a> of the\n     Constitution for enforcement of contractual rights and\n     obligation; the discussions are not intended to be\n     exhaustive.

Originally, the writ of mandamus was merely\n     an administrative order from the Sovereign to subordinates.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">     In England, in early times, it was made generally available\n     through the Court of King&#x27;s Bench, when the         Central\n     Government had little administrative machinery of its own.\n     Early decisions show that there was free use of the writ for\n     the enforcement of public duties of all kinds, for instance\n     against inferior tribunals which refused to exercise their\n     jurisdiction or against municipal corporations which did\n     not duly hold elections, meetings, and so forth. In modern\n     times, the mandamus is used to enforce statutory duties of\n          THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                      WP-10368-2020\n       Rajkmar Goyal Vs. Municipal Corporation Gwalior\n\n     public authorities. The courts always retained the discretion\n     to withhold the remedy where it would not be in the\n     interest of justice to grant it. It is also to be noticed that the\n     statutory duty imposed on the public authorities may not be\n     of discretionary character. A distinction had always been\n     drawn between the public duties enforceable by mandamus\n     that are statutory and duties arising merely from contract.\n     Contractual duties are enforceable as matters of private law\n     by ordinary contractual remedies such as damages,\n     injunction, specific performance and declaration. In the\n     Administrative Law (9th Edn.) by Sir William Wade and\n     Christopher Forsyth (Oxford University Press) at p. 621,\n     the following opinion is expressed:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">        &quot;A distinction which needs to be clarified is that\n        between public duties enforceable by mandamus,\n        which are usually statutory, and duties arising merely\n        from contract. Contractual duties are enforceable as\n        matters of private law by the ordinary contractual\n        remedies, such as damages, injunction, specific\n        performance and declaration. They are not\n        enforceable by mandamus, which in the first place is\n        confined to public duties and secondly is not granted\n        where there are other adequate remedies. This\n        difference is brought out by the relief granted in cases\n        of ultra vires. If for example a minister or a licensing\n        authority acts contrary to the principles of natural\n        justice, certiorari and mandamus are standard\n        remedies. But if a trade union disciplinary committee\n        acts in the same way, these remedies are inapplicable:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">        the rights of its members depend upon their contract\n        of membership, and are to be protected by declaration\n        and injunction, which accordingly are the remedies\n        employed in such cases.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"164673968\" id=\"span_20\">The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/164673968/\" id=\"a_39\">State of Kerala Vs.

Having referred to the aforesaid decisions, it is\nobligatory on our part to refer to two other authorities of\nthis Court where it has been opined that under what\ncircumstances a disputed question of fact can be gone into.\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1141333\" id=\"span_27\">In <a href=\"/doc/1141333/\" id=\"a_52\">Gunwant Kaur v.

The High Court observed that they will not\n   determine disputed question of fact in a writ petition.\n   But what facts were in dispute and what were admitted\n   could only be determined after an affidavit-in-reply\n   was filed by the State. The High Court, however,\n   proceeded to dismiss the petition in limine. The High\n   Court is not deprived of its jurisdiction to entertain a\n   petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_53\">Article 226</a> merely because in\n   considering the petitioner&#x27;s right to relief questions of\n   fact may fall to be determined. In a petition under\n   <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_54\">Article 226</a> the High Court has jurisdiction to try\n   issues both of fact and law. Exercise of the jurisdiction\n   is, it is true, discretionary, but the discretion must be\n   exercised on sound judicial principles.</span> When the\n   petition raises questions of fact of a complex nature,\n   which may for their determination require oral\n   evidence to be taken, and on that account the High\n   Court is of the view that the dispute may not\n    THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                WP-10368-2020\n Rajkmar Goyal Vs.

Rejection of a petition in\n  limine will normally be justified, where the High\n  Court is of the view that the petition is frivolous or\n  because of the nature of the claim made dispute sought\n  to be agitated, or that the petition against the party\n  against whom relief is claimed is not maintainable or\n  that the dispute raised thereby is such that it would be\n  inappropriate to try it in the writ jurisdiction, or for\n  analogous reasons.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_68\">   15. From the averments made in the petition filed by\n  the appellants it is clear that in proof of a large number\n  of allegations the appellants relied upon documentary\n  evidence and the only matter in respect of which\n  conflict of facts may possibly arise related to the due\n  publication of the notification under <a href=\"/doc/13503/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 4</a> by the\n  Collector.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">  16. In the present case, in our judgment, the High\n  Court was not justified in dismissing the petition on\n  the ground that it will not determine disputed question\n  of fact. The High Court has jurisdiction to determine\n  questions of fact, even if they are in dispute and the\n  present, in our judgment, is a case in which in the\n  interests of both the parties the High Court should\n  have entertained the petition and called for an\n  affidavit-in-reply from the respondents, and should\n  have proceeded to try the petition instead of relegating\n  the appellants to a separate suit.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">                                        (emphasis supplied)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">17. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_29\">In <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_56\">ABL International Ltd. v.

However, while entertaining an objection as to\n   the maintainability of a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_61\">Article 226</a>\n   of the Constitution of India, the court should bear in\n   mind the fact that the power to issue prerogative writs\n   under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_62\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is plenary in\n   nature and is not limited by any other provisions of the\n   Constitution.

The position thus summarised in the aforesaid\n     principles has to be understood in the context of discussion\n     that preceded which we have pointed out above. As per\n     this, no doubt, there is no absolute bar to the\n     maintainability of the writ petition even in contractual\n     matters or where there are disputed questions of fact or\n     even when monetary claim is raised. At the same time,\n     discretion lies with the High Court which under certain\n     circumstances, it can refuse to exercise. It also follows that\n     under the following circumstances, &quot;normally&quot;, the Court\n     would not exercise such a discretion:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">     69.1. The Court may not examine the issue unless the\n     action has some public law character attached to it.\n     69.2.

Further, the legal position which emerges from various\n     judgments of this Court dealing with different\n     situations/aspects relating to contracts entered into by the\n     State/public authority with private parties, can be\n     summarised as under:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">     70.1. At the stage of entering into a contract, the State acts\n     purely in its executive capacity and is bound by the\n     obligations of fairness.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">     70.2. State in its executive capacity, even in the contractual\n     field, is under obligation to act fairly and cannot practise\n     THE HIGH COURT OF MADHYA PRADESH\n                 WP-10368-2020\n  Rajkmar Goyal Vs.

If those facts are disputed and\nrequire assessment of evidence the correctness of which\ncan only be tested satisfactorily by taking detailed\nevidence, involving examination and cross-examination of\nwitnesses, the case could not be conveniently or\nsatisfactorily decided in proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 226</a> of\nthe Constitution.

It cannot\never be that a licensee can work out the licence if he finds\nit profitable to do so: and he can challenge the conditions\nunder which he agreed to take the licence, if he finds it\ncommercially inexpedient to conduct his business.\n70.6.

In fact, each case has to be\nexamined, on its facts whether the contractual relations\nbetween the parties bear insignia of public element. Once\non the facts of a particular case it is found that nature of the\nactivity or controversy involves public law element, then\nthe matter can be examined by the High Court in writ\npetitions under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_71\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to\nsee whether action of the State and/or instrumentality or\nagency of the State is fair, just and equitable or that\nrelevant factors are taken into consideration and irrelevant\nfactors have not gone into the decision-making process or\nthat the decision is not arbitrary.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_77\">70.10.

We are afraid the\n     High Court was wholly incorrect inasmuch as there was no\n     disputed question of fact. On the contrary, the amount\n     payable to the appellant is wholly undisputed.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_35\">Equally, it is\n     well settled that where the State behaves arbitrarily, even in\n     the realm of contract, the High Court could interfere under\n     <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_75\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India (<a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_76\">ABL International\n     Ltd. v.

However, after the declaration\n\nof amended provisions of Rule 15-A of Rules, 1998 as ultra vires, the\n\nState Govt. also could not release its share.             Under these\n\ncircumstances, this Court is of the considered opinion, that there\n\nexists a dispute between the Petitioner and the respondent and\n\naccordingly he should have approached the Dispute Resolution\n\nSystem as provided in Clause 12 of the General Conditions of\n\nContract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_81\">      It is next contended by the counsel for the petitioner that so far\n\nas the question of limitation is concerned, the petitioner was never\n\ninformed about the reasons for not making the payment, therefore, no\n\ncause of action had arisen, thus, the petitioner could not approach the\n\nDispute Resolution    System as provided under Clause 12 of the\n\nGeneral Conditions of Contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_82\">      Considered the submissions made by the counsel for the\n\npetitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_83\">      The petitioner has filed the copies of the note-sheet prepared\n\nby the respondent in all three different cases.

Whether the dispute of the petitioner\n\nhas become barred by limitation or not is a disputed question of fact,\n\nwhich cannot be decided by this Court while exercising power under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_80\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India.
