In this regard, this court cannot lose site of the fact that the\n\n                      contractor, i.e., proprietor examined himself as C.W.1 and offered himself for\n\n                      cross examination, but NHAI chose not to cross examine C.W.1.

NHAI have\n\n                      not even cross examined C.W.1 and having allowed more than 150\n\n                      documents (to be precise, 161 documents) to be marked by consent by the\n\n                      contractor cannot now be heard to contend that impugned awards did not\n\n                      pass the muster of Wednesbury test of reasonableness. Be that as it may,\n\n                      without resting on this aspect of the matter, this Court also examined the\n\n                      impugned awards carefully. A careful examination and analysis of impugned\n\n                      awards reveals that conclusions which impugned awards arrived at definitely\n\n                      do not fall in the category as those which no reasonable person will arrive at\n\n                      on the basis of materials which were before AT. Therefore, impugned awards\n\n                      are certainly not in contravention of the fundamental policy of the Indian law.\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">                             (aj)   This takes this Court to the next question as to whether\n\n                      impugned awards are in conflict with the most basic notions of morality or\n\n                      justice. The point that was urged in this regard is that impugned awards have\n\n                      acceded to the claims which are far in excess of the value of the contract\n\n                      itself. Merely because, award quantum is more than the value of the contract,\n\n                      it cannot lead to a conclusion that it is in conflict with most basic notions of\n\n                      morality or justice. To be noted, as already mentioned more than once supra\n\n                      and these principles have been tested keeping in mind explanation-2 that\nhttp://www.judis.nic.in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_73\">\f                                                              36</span>\n\n                      such test shall not entail a review on the merits of the dispute.\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">                               (ak)   This takes us to the question as to whether there is any patent\n\n                      illegality on the face of the award. Before this court proceeds further, it is to\n\n                      be made clear that in the considered view of this Court, the expression &#x27;patent\n\n                      illegality appearing on the face of the award&#x27; , occurring in <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_114\">section 34</a>(2-<a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_115\">A) of\n\n                      A and C Act</a> necessarily means a illegality which is so obvious that no\n\n                      inferential process need to be applied for detecting the same. In other words,\n\n                      an illegality which is so patent and obvious which does not require any\n\n                      inferential process to be applied to arrive at a conclusion that it is illegal, will\n\n                      fall in the category of patent illegality appearing on the face of the award. A\n\n                      careful reading of impugned awards leads this court to a conclusion that this\n\n                      court is unable to find any such patent illegality on the face of the award. To\n\n                      be noted, this test of patent illegality has also been applied keeping in mind\n\n                      the proviso that a mere erroneous application of law cannot be the basis for\n\n                      setting aside an award on the ground of patent illegality. The other restriction\n\n                      that reappreciation of evidence is impermissible in testing the patent illegality\n\n                      plea. When patent illegality plea is applied keeping in view these two\n\n                      restrictions and also the manner in which this court understands the\n\n                      expression &#x27;patent illegality appearing on the face of the award, which has\n\n                      been alluded to supra, this Court is unable to persuade itself to believe that\n\n                      impugned awards are vitiated by patent illegality appearing on the face of the\n\n                      award and are therefore liable to be set aside under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_116\">section 34</a>(2-<a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_117\">A) of A and\n\n                      C Act</a>.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">                               <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1292137\" id=\"span_74\">(al)   This takes us to the last limb of discussion.
