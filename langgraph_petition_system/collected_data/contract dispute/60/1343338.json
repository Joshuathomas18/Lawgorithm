The relevant part of the aforesaid \n      order of the Division Bench of this Court shows that the parties consented \n\n\n\n\n                                                      \n      only   to   the   extent   that   the   Central   Government   was   the   appropriate \n                                    \n      Government.  Since all the contentions were left open the Petitioner cannot \n      be   taken   to   have   consented   to   the   reference   on   behalf   of   the   contract \n                                   \n      labourers whose case is stated not to have been espoused by the workmen \n      of   the   Petitioner.     The   dispute   in   Reference   (CGIT-1)   No.14   of   2003   is \n      between the Petitioner and &quot;their workmen&quot; represented by the Respondent \n             \n\n\n      No.1.  Whether these were the workmen of the Petitioner and whether they \n          \n\n\n\n      were entitled to be represented by the union of the Petitioner or whether \n      they had to maintain their lis either as contract labourers or as workmen \n\n\n\n\n\n      would   have   to   be   seen.   Hence,   the   Petitioner&#x27;s   contentions   on \n      maintainability shall have to be considered as per the law which is shown \n      to Court. \n</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">    6. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1198151\" id=\"span_7\">In the case between  <a href=\"/doc/1198151/\" id=\"a_4\">Workmen of Dimakuchi Tea Estate   (Assam Chah \n      Karmachari Sangh) Vs.

Considering the three aspects to which the \n    dispute must relate, it was observed that the person in respect of whom the \n    employer - employee   relation never existed or can never possibly exist \n\n\n\n\n                                                               \n    cannot be the subject matter of a dispute between employer and workmen. \n    It   was   further   observed   that   the   definition   clause   must   be   read   in   the \n    context of the subject matter and scheme of the Act and consistently with \n\n\n\n\n                                                    \n    the   objects   and   other   provisions   of   the   Act.

Considering this by setting out the \n    preamble and the purport  of  the  various chapters of the  Act  the  salient \n    provisions of the Act came to be enunciated which inter alia was shown to \n           \n\n\n    include   collective   bargaining.   For   conceptualising     the   definition   of   any \n        \n\n\n\n    person in the definition clause, 4 limitations were set out which inter alia \n    show that the workmen must have a nexus with the dispute either because \n\n\n\n\n\n    they were personally interested or because they had taken up the cause of \n    another person in the general interest of labour welfare. Consequently, the \n    workers were held not vitally interested by the reason that they belonged \n\n\n\n\n\n    to the trade union in which one of its members&#x27; dismissal was in question \n    which   became   a   matter   of   general   interest   to   all   the   workmen   in   the \n    establishment.

Therefore, their case must necessarily be taken up \n       by   other   workmen.

The other \n           \n\n\n\n       workers can have no nexus with their dispute.   Their dispute is personal \n       only to them.

It may at once be mentioned that in \n                                   \n      any contract for appointing labour the contractors form a nodal point for \n      providing various persons who are skilled or unskilled labourers to various \n                                  \n      industries as and when they make a demand.   The contractors pay their \n      wages and salary and give them the statutory benefits.  The labourers work \n      in the industrial establishment.   Hence they are supervised, and naturally \n             \n\n\n      so, by the officers of that industrial establishment and not by the contractor \n          \n\n\n\n      who only provides the labour force.  Similarly, their muster is kept by the \n      officers of the industrial establishment.   It is based upon the muster roll \n\n\n\n\n\n      that they would be paid their wages or salary.  Hence, it is the duty of the \n      establishment   to   maintain   the   documentation   like   record   of   their \n      attendance, duty roasters, muster rolls etc., the same goes for their leave, \n\n\n\n\n\n      because if they are absent from their work they cannot be paid their daily \n      wages or monthly salary.  It is only the industrial establishment who would \n      maintain   their   record   and   handover   to   the   contractor   to   enable   him   to \n      make payment for the work done or to refuse payment for the work not \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                                                ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:15:51 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                                                27                                WP.123/2009</span>\n\n    done.   It is, therefore, immaterial that the contractor never visits them at \n    their place of work; he does not require to.   The materials that would be \n\n\n\n\n                                                                                       \n    used   by   them   in   the   work   may   be   provided   by   the   contractor   or   the \n\n\n\n\n                                                               \n    industrial establishment which is depending on the type of work required. \n    The entry pass given to them as against the identity card for the permanent \n    workers is for identification and for access to an area where otherwise they \n\n\n\n\n                                                              \n    would not be able to obtain access.  It is meant not only for security, but for \n    distinction   between   the   types   of   workers   and   labourers   in   the \n    establishment.   It is natural that they would work on the premises of the \n\n\n\n\n                                                   \n    establishment;   they   need   not   and   cannot   work   on   the   premises   of   the \n                                  \n    contractor.     The   fact   that   they   are   given   salary   /   wages   and   statutory \n    benefit by the contractor is an incident of contract itself.  It does not matter \n                                 \n    whether they work in some or all the shifts.  Their work would be required \n    in some or all the shifts.  The various conditions in the contracts between \n    the contractor and the Petitioner would itself demonstrate the requirement \n           \n\n\n    of   a   valid   contract.     Upon   the   complaints   of   the   customers   the \n        \n\n\n\n    Housekeeping and Maintenance Department would get the work done by \n    the contract labourers.  Hence, a check of the terminal building by them is \n\n\n\n\n\n    a necessary condition precedent as well as subsequent to their work. What \n    is of essence is that they have no qualifications and would otherwise not \n    have been employed, they cannot be employed as permanent workmen in \n\n\n\n\n\n    the   normal   course   and   hence,   they   are   not   issued   appointment   letters. \n    Similarly, what is noticeably striking is that they are not issued any memos \n    or charge-sheet also as the permanent workers. \n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                                                               ::: Downloaded on - 09/06/2013 16:15:51 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_77\">                                                     28                                WP.123/2009</span>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">    35.The   substance   of   their   evidence   must,   therefore,   be   seen.
