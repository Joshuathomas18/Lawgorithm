The present writ petition is not maintainable as the\n     Hon&#x27;ble High Court of Telangana at Hyderabad is not the\n     appropriate forum to adjudicate on the issues between\n     Petitioner and Zetwerk. The terms of the Amended\n     Purchase Agreement which governs the relationship\n     between    the   Petitioner      and     Zetwerk    categorically\n     stipulates that any disputes relating to this matter will\n     have to be referred to the exclusive jurisdiction of the\n     Courts in Mumbai only. It reads:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">           &quot;Any disputes relating to this matter will have to\n           be referred to the exclusive jurisdiction of the\n           Courts in Mumbai only and is binding on both\n           Borrower (Petitioner) and Corporate Guarantor\n           (Zetwerk) unconditionally agree to submit thereto,\n           and to that extent the clause in relation to\n           Arbitration in the Purchase Agreement shall not\n           apply, unless otherwise agreed to by the Lender in\n           writing and shall not be acted or insisted upon by\n           the Borrower and/or the Corporate Guarantor&quot;.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">     15. The Petitioner is a signatory to the Amended\n     Purchase Agreement which is the document that has the\n     entire understanding of the Petitioner, Zetwerk and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                              7</span>\n                                                            WP_24169_2023\n                                                                     SN,J\n\n\n\n\nCFPL. Despite being a signatory to the Amended\nPurchase Agreement which categorically records that\nthe Petitioner and Zetwerk have agreed to secure by\nway of first and exclusive charge the assignment of all\nthe rights and benefits of the Bank Guarantee, to CFPL,\nthe Petitioner has not disclosed the same.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">16. Despite being a signatory to the Amended Purchase\nAgreement that contains this clause, the Petitioner has\nsecured an interim order from this court on the false\nground that the bank guarantees are only for the\nmaterials supplied by Zetwerk and therefore the bank\nguarantees cannot be invoked for the benefit of CFPL.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">17.    Contrary   to   the       assertion    of   the    Petitioner,\nadmittedly, the Amended Purchase Agreement also\nspecifies that the term &#x27;provision of material supply\nservices&#x27; shall mean to include provision of the loan to\nthe Petitioner by CFPL. Therefore, the Petitioner&#x27;s\nobjections regarding Zetwerk&#x27;s locus for invoking bank\nguarantees for amounts owed to CFPL are incorrect.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_12\">25. The Writ Petition is liable to be dismissed at the\nthreshold stage since at the directions of the Petitioner,\nthe Respondent No. 1 bank had undertaken that on\ndemand from Zetwerk, the guaranteed amount shall be\npaid   to   Zetwerk    without      any      demur,      reservation,\nrecourse, contest or protest and without any reference\nto any third party. Therefore, if Zetwerk chooses to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                8</span>\n                                                       WP_24169_2023\n                                                                SN,J\n\n\n\n\n     invoke the bank guarantee, the banks are obliged to\n     honour the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">     26. It is settled law that in case of an unconditional and\n     irrevocable bank guarantee, the nature of obligation of\n     the bank is absolute and is not dependent upon any\n     dispute or proceeding between the party at whose\n     instance   the   bank   guarantee   is   given   and     the\n     beneficiary. The terms of the bank guarantee are\n     therefore extremely material, as both the parties would\n     be bound by the terms thereof. Therefore, if and when\n     Zetwerk chooses to invoke the bank guarantee, the\n     banks are obliged to honour the same.&quot;\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">c)   Para 45 and Para 46 of the rejoinder filed by the\n\nPetitioner read as follows :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">     &quot;45. That the contents of Para 26 are admitted to the\n     extent that terms of the Bank Guarantee are extremely\n     material and both parties are bound by it. In the\n     present case, the Respondent No. 2 has further\n     failed to supply material in terms of the Bank\n     Guarantees and in terms of the Agreement, which\n     forms the very basis of the Bank Guarantees. At\n     the cost of repetition, it is stated that the encashment\n     can be done only within the terms of the Bank\n     Guarantees itself. The contents of the writ petition as\n     well as the preliminary objections and submissions may\n     be read as part and parcel of the present para and are\n     not repeated herein for the sake of brevity.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                              9</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">                                                     WP_24169_2023\n                                                              SN,J\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     46. That the contents of Para 27 are admitted to the\n     extent that the Bank Guarantees are an independent\n     and distinct contract. However, Respondent No.1 is\n     bound by the terms of the Bank Guarantee itself which\n     does not permit encashment except for the reasons and\n     grounds stated therein. Since Respondent No.2 has\n     hopelessly failed to establish supply of material either\n     by itself or through its network vendor, the Bank\n     Guarantees cannot be encashed. The contents of the\n     writ petition as well as the preliminary objections and\n     submissions may be read as part and parcel of the\n     present para and are not repeated herein for the sake of\n     brevity.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">4.

Thus, based on the representations and insistence\n\nof the 2nd respondent, the Petitioner and Capsave entered into\n\na working capital loan agreement, which was understood to\n\nbe utilized by the Petitioner for all its working capital\n\nrequirements including for the payment to be made to the 2nd\n\nrespondent which was to be made as and when the 2nd\n\nRespondent was able to facilitate supply of goods to the\n\nPetitioner.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_22\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_23\">f)    Then upon the 2nd respondent&#x27;s insistence, Purchase\n\nAgreement dated 14.11.2021 (&quot;Purchase Agreement - II&quot;)\n\nwas signed between the 2nd respondent and the petitioner and\n\neven at the time of executing of Purchase Agreement- II, the\n\n2nd Respondent again represented that the documents being\n\nsigned    are   standard   documents         containing    standardized\n\nboilerplate clause and copies would be provided later.\n\nHowever, till date copy of the said agreement has not been\n\nprovided to the Petitioner.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                13</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_25\">                                                         WP_24169_2023\n                                                                  SN,J\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_26\">g)    Furthermore, the 2nd respondent insisted upon issuance\n\nof further bank guarantees purportedly for securing payment\n\nunder the Purchase Agreement - II.

The failure of the\n\n2nd Respondent is evident from Petitioner&#x27;s email dated\n\n24.11.2022 whereby the Petitioner sent a request for financial\n\nquote to the 2nd respondent for certain materials. However,\n\nno response was received from the 2nd respondent thereafter.\n\nTherefore, the Petitioner utilized the credit line extended by\n\nCapsave to meet its other working capital requirements\n\nincluding payment to its own suppliers and consolidation of\n\nother working capital loans.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                 14</span><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">                                                               WP_24169_2023\n                                                                        SN,J\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">i)    Thereafter, the 2nd respondent in order to lure the\n\nPetitioner into executing further agreements, also represented\n\nthat they would facilitate the entire process of renewal and\n\nenhancement of working capital limit with Capsave and in\n\norder to assist the Petitioner in obtaining enhanced limit, it\n\nwould also give a corporate guarantee an based on the\n\nrepresentations of the 2nd Respondent, the parties executed\n\ntwo &#x27;First Amendment to the Purchase Agreement&#x27; in relation\n\nto Purchase Agreement- I and II on 28.03.2023 (&#x27;First\n\nAmendment Agreements&#x27;). Notably, Capsave was also added\n\nas a party to these First Amendment Agreements. Despite\n\nentering   into   such   extensive    agreements      with     a      new\n\nunderstanding, the 2nd respondent has failed to honour its\n\nobligations under the said First Amendment Agreements\n\ndated 28.03.2023 and could not connect the Petitioner with\n\nany reliable vendor. Alongside, all the bank guarantees issued\n\nin favour of the 2nd respondent are all valid till date.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">j)    Subsequently,      Capsave     has   revealed   itself     to    be\n\nunreliable and unethical as a consequence of which, various\n\ndisputes have arisen between Capsave and the Petitioner.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                15</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_33\">                                                       WP_24169_2023\n                                                                SN,J\n\n\n\n\nFurther, as informed by the 2nd respondent, Capsave has also\n\nraise huge claims against the Petitioner but the details of the\n\nsame have not been provided to the Petitioner.

The said letter of invocation is\n\ngrossly and patently fraudulent and unlawful. Since the\n\nPetitioner has never received any supply of material from the\n\n2nd respondent or any of its vendors and no amount is due\n\nand payable to the 2nd respondent, the same is not entitled to\n\nencash the Bank Guarantees. Hence, this Writ Petition.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                       16</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">                                                                  WP_24169_2023\n                                                                           SN,J\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">5.

Because the Respondent No. 1 has abandoned all\n     banking norms and it is acting in an entirely arbitrary\n     manner by agreeing to encash fraudulent invocation by\n     the Respondent No. 1 towards liabilities that arise under\n     the corporate guarantee to which the bank guarantee\n     does not apply and neither Petitioner nor Respondent\n     No.    1    are   parties,       for    reasons    best    known      to\n     themselves.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_38\">\n     C. Because it is an established principle in law that a\n     Bank       Guarantee       is    a     separate   and     independent\n     document, and it has to be interpreted and invoked it in\n     own terms. The Respondent No. 2 in the present case\n     has tried to invoke the current Bank Guarantee de hors\n     the terms of the Bank Guarantee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">\n     D. Because the First Amendment to the Purchase\n     Agreement is a complete rewrite of the terms and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                         17</span>\n                                                   WP_24169_2023\n                                                            SN,J\n\n\n\n\ncontractual relationship of the parties as under the\nPurchase   Agreement    -I   &amp;   II.   Further,   the   First\nAmendment to the Purchase Agreement, being a tri-\npartite agreement, novates the Purchase Agreement I &amp;\nII, thereby making it a new agreement as opposed to an\n&quot;amendment&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_40\">\nE. Because as per the terms of the Bank Guarantee, the\nRespondent No.2 has the right to invoke the Bank\nGuarantee in case of breach of the Petitioner in terms of\nthe Purchase Agreement 1 &amp; 2 and their amendments.\nThe First amendment to the Purchase Agreement being\na completely new and tri- partite agreement is not\ncovered within the terms of the Bank Guarantee.\nF. Because even in terms of the First Amendment to the\nPurchase Agreement, there has been no supply of\nconstruction material from the Respondent No.2 or any\nof its suppliers/vendors to the Petitioner. Consequently,\nno invoice has been raised by the Respondent No.2 on\nthe Petitioner. Hence, no amount remains due and\npayable to the Respondent No.2 or Capsave in terms of\nthe Purchase Agreement - I &amp; II and the First\nAmendment to the Purchase Agreement.\n\n\nG. Because in terms of the First Amendment to the\nPurchase Agreement, Capsave has the sole right to\ninvoke the Bank Guarantee and benefit under the same.\nThus, under no circumstances does the Respondent\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                            18</span>\n                                                            WP_24169_2023\n                                                                     SN,J\n\n\n\n\nNo.2 has the right to invoke and encash the Bank\nGuarantee.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">H. Because the Respondent No. 2 has invoked the Bank\nGuarantee with the fraudulent intent to extort money\nfrom the Petitioner herein. Since there has been no\nsupply made by the Respondent No.2 or any of its\nvendors and no         invoice has been raised by the\nRespondent No. 2 on the Petitioner herein, no sum\nremains due and payable. Thus, such unjust enrichment\nis neither permitted under the law or in terms of the\nPurchase Agreement - 1 &amp; II and the First Amendment\nto the Purchase Agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">\nI. Because in any event, de hors the terms of the\nAgreement     between         the      parties   and   the      fraud\nperpetrated by the Respondent No.2, it is submitted\nthat in the present case even the first tenet of meeting\nthe terms of the Bank Guarantee for invocation of bank\nguarantee has also not been met. The Respondent No.1\nBank cannot encash the guarantee contrary to its own\nterms,    irrespective   of      any     disputes   between        the\nPetitioner and Respondent No.2\n\n\nJ. Because the Respondent No.2 has categorically stated\nin their email dated 23.08.2023, that there is an\nextreme     pressure     from       Capsave      due   to      which\nRespondent      No.2     shall      be     invoking    the      Bank\nGuarantees.

Because any amount due against Capsave is solely\n     arising out of disbursement against invoices raised by\n     the supplier network of the Petitioner herein. Suffice it is\n     to say that since no working capital loan was disbursed\n     against the invoices raised by the Respondent No. 2,\n     neither the Respondent No.1 has the authority to\n     encash the Bank Guarantees, nor the Respondent No. 2\n     has any locus to invoke the Bank Guarantees.&quot;\n\n\n\n     The    learned      senior     counsel   basing    on         the\n\naforesaid submissions contends that the writ petition\n\nshould be allowed as prayed for.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_44\">     DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_45\">6.

Both the Bank Guarantees were invoked by the\n      defendants and it was, at this stage, that HCCL filed a\n      suit on 21.10.1992 in the Bombay High Court against\n      State bank of India, State bank of Patiala and Indian\n      Bank (defendants 1 to 3) and the State of Bihar and its\n      officers (defendants 4 to 6) for various reliefs, including\n      principal relief that defendants 1 to 3 may be restrained\n      from making payment of the amount covered by the\n      aforesaid Bank Guarantees to defendants 4 to 6. An\n      interim order was passed by the Single Judge in the suit\n      on 27.10.1992 and under this interim order, the\n      defendants were restrained from invoking the Bank\n      Guarantees and the Banks were restrained from making\n      payment of the amount covered by the Bank\n      Guarantees to the defendants. The interim order was\n      confirmed on 9.2.1996.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">      7. The defendants have filed a separate appeal against\n      that part of the order by which the injunction order in\n      respect of the &quot;Performance Guarantee&quot; has been\n      upheld by the Division Bench. It is contended on their\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                               36</span>\n                                                      WP_24169_2023\n                                                               SN,J\n\n\n\n\n      behalf that the &quot;Performance Guarantee&quot;, which\n      constituted a separate and distinct contract between the\n      defendants and the Bank, was unconditional and\n      unequivocal and since the Bank had undertaken to pay\n      the amount covered by that Guarantee to the\n      defendants on their demand, the injunction order,\n      granted by the High Court, was liable to be set aside.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">      9. What is important, therefore, is that the Bank\n      Guarantee     should    be    in   unequivocal  terms,\n      unconditional and recite that the amount would be paid\n      without demur or objection and irrespective of any\n      dispute that might have cropped up or might have been\n      pending between the beneficiary under the Bank\n      Guarantee or the person on whose behalf the Guarantee\n      was furnished. The terms of the Bank Guarantee\n      are, therefore, extremely material. Since the Bank\n      Guarantee represents an independent contract\n      between the Bank and the beneficiary, both the\n      parties would be bound by the terms thereof. The\n      invocation, therefore, will have to be in\n      accordance with the terms of the Bank Guarantee;\n      or else, the invocation itself would be bad.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">17.   A bare perusal of the terms of the subject Bank\n\nGuarantees clearly indicate that the Bank Guarantees\n\nhad been issued by the Petitioner in favour of the 2nd\n\nRespondent in relation to supply of materials and\n\nservices or from any of its network suppliers referred to\n\nas    beneficiary   which   shall   mean    to   include      its\n\nsuccessors, administrators, attorneys and assignees\n\nand further that the Bank Guarantees are for the supply\n\nof material by 2nd Respondent herein to the Petitioner\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                             37</span>\n                                                   WP_24169_2023\n                                                            SN,J\n\n\n\n\nherein and in the event of any breach of Agreement by\n\nthe Petitioner the beneficiary shall have all the rights to\n\nrecover the overdue amounts including interest and all\n\nother charges if any through the invocation of the\n\nguarantee. It is however, Petitioner&#x27;s plea that since\n\nthe Petitioner&#x27;s contract with Respondent No.2 was for\n\nsupply of goods and since the Respondent No.2 failed to\n\nsupply the goods to the Petitioner, there cannot be any\n\ninvocation of Bank Guarantee.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_73\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_74\">18.

This Court takes note that the dispute\n\nbetween the Petitioner and the 2nd Respondent is\n\npurely   commercial   in   nature   and   the   Agreement\n\nbetween the parties is contractual in nature and the\n\nappropriate remedy available to the Petitioner is to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                         38</span>\n                                                                     WP_24169_2023\n                                                                              SN,J\n\n\n\n\napproach      the     Court        of   competent        jurisdiction       for\n\nappropriate        relief    for    Breach         of   Contract     as     per\n\n<a href=\"/doc/120013228/\" id=\"a_16\">Sec.2(c)(i)</a> of the Commercial Courts Act, 2015.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_75\">19.

A statute may expressly or impliedly confer power\non a statutory body to enter into contracts in order to\nenable it to discharge its functions. Dispute arising out\nof the terms of such contracts or alleged breaches have\nto be settled by the ordinary principles of law of\ncontract. The fact that one of the parties to the\nagreement is a statutory or public body will not by itself\naffect the principles to be applied. The disputes about\nthe meaning of a covenant in a contract or its\nenforceability have to be determined according to the\nusual principles of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_23\">Contract Act</a>. Every act of a\nstatutory body need not necessarily involve an exercise\nof   statutory   power.   Statutory   bodies,   like    private\nparties, have power to contract or deal with property.\nSuch activities may not raise any issue of public law. In\nthe present case, it has not been shown how the\ncontract is statutory. The contract between the parties\nis in the realm of private law. It is not a statutory\ncontract. The disputes relating to interpretation of the\nterms and conditions of such a contract could not have\nbeen agitated in a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 226</a> of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                 41</span>\n                                                        WP_24169_2023\n                                                                 SN,J\n\n\n\n\n      Constitution of India. That is a matter for adjudication\n      by a civil court or in arbitration if provided for in the\n      contract. Whether any amount is due and if so, how\n      much and refusal of the appellant to pay it is justified or\n      not, are not the matters which could have been agitated\n      and decided in a writ petition.

The Court has imposed upon itself certain\n      restrictions in the exercise of this power [See: <a href=\"/doc/1885496/\" id=\"a_30\">Whirlpool\n      Corporation vs. Registrar of Trade Marks, Mumbai &amp;\n      Ors.</a> [1998 (8) SCC 1].

The Apex\n\ncourt held that the writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 226</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India is not the proper proceeding for\n\nadjudicating such disputes. Under the law, it was open\n\nto the Respondent therein, to approach the Court of\n\ncompetent jurisdiction for appropriate relief for breach\n\nof contract. It is settled law that when an alternative\n\nand equally efficacious remedy is available to a litigant,\n\nhe should be required to pursue that remedy and not\n\ninvoke the writ jurisdiction of the High Court. Equally,\n\nthe existence of an alternative remedy does not effect\n\nthe jurisdiction of the Court to issue a writ, but\n\nordinarily, that would be a good ground in refusing to\n\nexercise   the   discretion   under   <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_35\">Article   226</a>   of     the\n\nConstitution of India.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_88\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_89\">27.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77081689\" id=\"span_51\">In <a href=\"/doc/77081689/\" id=\"a_36\">Joshi Technologies International Inc., Vs.

The principles of law which emerge are that:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">      (i) The power under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_39\">Article 226</a> of the\n      Constitution to issue writs can be exercised not\n      only for the enforcement of fundamental rights,\n      but for any other purpose as well;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">      (ii) The High Court has the discretion not to\n      entertain a writ petition. One of the restrictions\n      placed on the power of the High Court is where an\n      effective alternate remedy is available to the\n      aggrieved person;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">      (iii) Exceptions to the rule of alternate remedy\n      arise where (a) the writ petition has been filed for\n      the enforcement of a fundamental right protected\n      by Part III of the Constitution; (b) there has been\n      a violation of the principles of natural justice; (c)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                              45</span>\n                                                   WP_24169_2023\n                                                            SN,J\n\n\n\n\n      the order or proceedings are wholly without\n      jurisdiction; or (d) the vires of a legislation is\n      challenged;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">      (iv) An alternate remedy by itself does not divest\n      the High Court of its powers under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_40\">Article 226</a> of\n      the Constitution in an appropriate case though\n      ordinarily, a writ petition should not be\n      entertained when an efficacious alternate remedy\n      is provided by law;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">      (v) When a right is created by a statute, which\n      itself prescribes the remedy or procedure for\n      enforcing the right or liability, resort must be had\n      to that particular statutory remedy before\n      invoking the discretionary remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_41\">Article\n      226</a> of the Constitution. This rule of exhaustion of\n      statutory remedies is a rule of policy, convenience\n      and discretion; and\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">      (vi) In cases where there are disputed questions\n      of fact, the High Court may decide to decline\n      jurisdiction in a writ petition. However, if the\n      High Court is objectively of the view that the\n      nature of the controversy requires the exercise of\n      its writ jurisdiction, such a view would not readily\n      be interfered with.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_92\">29.   In the present case, this Court opines that the\n\ncase of the Petitioner falls in Clause (ii), (iv), (v) and\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_93\">(vi) and does not fit in any of the exceptions to the\n\nDoctrine   of   Alternate   Remedy   and   the   purported\n\nirretrievable injustice alleged by the Petitioner is not an\n\ninjustice but a consequence specifically agreed upon by\n\nthe Petitioner in terms of the Bank Guarantees.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                            46</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_94\">                                                     WP_24169_2023\n                                                              SN,J\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_95\">30.
