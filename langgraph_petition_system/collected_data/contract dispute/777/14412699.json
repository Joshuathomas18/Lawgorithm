The said amount was subsequently\n                          corrected by an order dated 17.11.2018 passed under <a href=\"/doc/181078/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 33</a> of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">By:DUSHYANT               FAO(OS)(COMM) 107/2019                                       Page 6 of 28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">RAWAL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n                           A&amp;C Act and increased to ₹1,41,70,767/-. In addition, the Arbitral\n                          Tribunal allowed Claim no.3 to the extent of 50% and awarded a sum\n                          of ₹1,28,17,360/-. In addition, the Arbitral Tribunal also awarded\n                          interest on the sums awarded against Claim nos.1 and 2. Additionally,\n                          the Arbitral Tribunal also awarded pendente lite and future interest in\n                          respect of all the Claims (Claim nos.1 to 4) at the rate of SBI PLR rate\n                          plus 2% per annum in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1673226/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 20</a>.21 of the Concession\n                          Agreement.

Ms Salwan, learned counsel appearing for DSIIDC, submitted\n                          that the Arbitral Tribunal had grossly erred in allowing the\n                          respondent&#x27;s claim for annuities with effect from 01.11.2013. She\n                          submitted that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1216959/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 12</a>.1 of the Concession Agreement,\n                          the annuity was payable subject to the provisions of the Concession\n                          Agreement and the concessionaire achieving the ACD. She submitted\n                          that the Arbitral Tribunal had failed to appreciate that the respondent\n                          had not complied with the terms of the Concession Agreement and\n                          therefore, was not entitled to payment of annuity. She stated that in\n                          terms of <a href=\"/doc/1080390/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 11</a>.7 of the Concession Agreement, the\n                          concessionaire was required to maintain books of accounts to record\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">By:DUSHYANT               FAO(OS)(COMM) 107/2019                                    Page 7 of 28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">RAWAL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n                           all receipts from all sources or on account of the project, income,\n                          expenditure, payment, assets and liabilities on accrual basis and in\n                          accordance with the applicable accounting standards. The respondent\n                          was required to appoint an auditor to audit its account and was obliged\n                          to provide DSIIDC copies of the audited balance sheet and profit and\n                          loss account along with report of the statutory auditors. Further,\n                          DSIIDC also had the right to conduct the audit of the respondent&#x27;s\n                          books of accounts either by itself or through an authorized\n                          representative. She submitted that the respondent had granted the\n                          Engineering Procurement Construction (EPC) contract to execute the\n                          construction work to its promoter, PNCIL, and therefore, its books of\n                          accounts did not disclose details of payments and expenditure incurred\n                          by the sub-contractor in developing the project. Consequently, the\n                          auditors appointed by DSIIDC reported that it was not possible to\n                          report on the actual deployment of funds by the EPC contractor as the\n                          same were not reflected in the respondent&#x27;s books of accounts. In\n                          addition, she submitted that the impugned award was beyond the\n                          scope of the claims made inasmuch as the Arbitral Tribunal had not\n                          only awarded the claim for four plus one annuity payments that were\n                          claimed as due, but had issued directions to pay future annuities as\n                          well. She submitted that no such award could be rendered as payment\n                          of annuities in future were contingent upon the respondent complying\n                          with its obligations.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">                          18.   She also submitted that the Arbitral Tribunal had wrongly\n                          construed the ACD as 31.10.2013. She submitted that the CC was\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">By:DUSHYANT               FAO(OS)(COMM) 107/2019                                   Page 8 of 28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">RAWAL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n                           issued on 14.03.2014 and therefore, the said date must be construed as\n                          the ACD. She submitted that prior to that, the TPE had, by its letter\n                          dated 24.10.2013, rejected the respondent&#x27;s request for a PCC. The\n                          PCC dated 31.10.2013 was thereafter forwarded under the cover of a\n                          letter dated 23.12.2013 and therefore, the ACD could not be construed\n                          as a date prior to 23.12.2013. She contended that the CC was\n                          forwarded under the cover of the letter dated 03.03.2014, which was\n                          received on 14.03.2014; therefore, that date was required to be\n                          construed as the ACD.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_26\">                          19.   Ms Salwan contested the award against Claim no.2 - collection\n                          of maintenance charges - principally on the same ground, that is, that\n                          the Arbitral Tribunal had misconstrued the date for completion of the\n                          works. The respondent was entitled to collect the maintenance charges\n                          from the date of issuance of the CC and not prior to the said date.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_27\">                          20.   Ms Salwan also assailed the impugned award to the extent that\n                          the Arbitral Tribunal had allowed the claim of damages in respect of\n                          the loss suffered by the respondent on account of non-reduction of\n                          interest by OBC. She stated that DSIIDC could not be held liable for\n                          the creditworthiness of the respondent, which depends on several\n                          factors. She also pointed out that the Arbitral Tribunal had not\n                          accepted that timely payment of annuity would have resulted in a 75-\n                          basis point reduction in the rate of interest charged by OBC as there\n                          was no material to establish the same. Notwithstanding the same, the\n                          Arbitral Tribunal had, on a broad assumption, awarded 50% of the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">By:DUSHYANT               FAO(OS)(COMM) 107/2019                                     Page 9 of 28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">RAWAL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n                           amount claimed without any material or evidence to prove the same.\n                          She contended that the learned Single Judge had also erred in\n                          upholding the impugned award.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">                          21.     Mr Vikas Goel, learned counsel for the respondent had\n                          countered the aforesaid submissions.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_29\">                          REASONS AND CONCLUSION\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">                          22.     At the outset, it is relevant to mention the principal dispute\n                          between the parties relates to the Annuity Commencement Date.\n                          According to the appellant, the ACD was not the date of issuance of\n                          the PCC by the TPE. The PCC was issued on 31.10.2013. Thus, the\n                          project was required to be treated as complete for the purposes of\n                          payment of annuity. A punch list was prepared by the TPE and the\n                          same was also completed on 31.01.2014. TPE issued the CC on\n                          03.03.2014 effective from the date of completion of the punch list\n                          items    on   31.01.2014. Although     there   was   some delay          in\n                          communication of the PCC and the CC as the same were forwarded\n                          under covers of the letter dated 23.12.2013 and 03.03.2014. DSIIDC\n                          claimed that it received the CC on 14.03.2014 and therefore, the\n                          annuity payments would commence from the said date. It was the\n                          respondent&#x27;s case that it could not be penalized for the delay in\n                          forwarding the PCC or the CC. Further, in terms of the Concession\n                          Agreement, the ACD was agreed to be the date of issuance of the\n                          PCC. As noted above, it is also DSIIDC&#x27;s case that the respondent had\n                          not complied with the terms of the Concession Agreement inasmuch\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">By:DUSHYANT               FAO(OS)(COMM) 107/2019                                   Page 10 of 28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">RAWAL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n                           as the auditors appointed by DSIIDC were unable to audit the\n                          deployment of funds by the sub-contractors.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">                          23.      The Arbitral Tribunal had considered the rival contentions and\n                          found merit in the respondent&#x27;s case that it was entitled to annuity\n                          from the date of issuance of the PCC. The Arbitral Tribunal held as\n                          under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">                                   &quot;23. Since the respondent has taken a defense that Annuity is\n                                   not at all payable because Claimant did not comply with the\n                                   requirements of <a href=\"/doc/1080390/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 11</a>.7(b) of the CA, it will be useful to\n                                   take note of <a href=\"/doc/1080390/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 11</a>.7 of the CA which relates to Audit and\n                                   Accounts. There is no dispute that the Concessionaire is a\n                                   company and its accounts are audited by Statutory Auditors.\n                                   There is no denial that copies of audited balance sheet and\n                                   profit and loss account were made available and subsequently\n                                   DSIIDC has also exercised its right to conduct audit of\n                                   Claimant&#x27;s books of account. The grievance of the DSIIDC that\n                                   the Concessionaire failed to establish and maintain a Quarterly\n                                   Reporting System to provide storage and ready retrieval of data\n                                   relating to the construction and operation of the Project is based\n                                   upon provisions in <a href=\"/doc/1080390/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 11</a>.7(b) (ii). It has come in the\n                                   evidence of Mr. T.R.Rao, CW-I that there was no format\n                                   mutually agreed between the parties or even imposed by\n                                   DSIIDC and, therefore, the required informations, as per\n                                   answer to Question No.53 was made available to the\n                                   respondent - &quot;in the form of Monthly Progress Reports,\n                                   designated account of respondent and Escrow Account.&quot; On\n                                   behalf of the Claimant, it was shown that <a href=\"/doc/1907423/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 10</a>.8 require\n                                   the Concessionaire to provide video recording on quarterly\n                                   basis covering the status and progress of works in that quarter.\n                                   There is no grievance that this was not done by the\n                                   Concessionaire. Auditor&#x27;s Report dated 21.8.2014 was also\n                                   referred to by learned counsel for the Claimant for highlighting\n                                   that everything was done in proper manner and DSIIDC has\n                                   unnecessarily raised a grievance that the expenditure related\n                                   vouchers and their supporting bills of the sub-contractor were\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_53\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">By:DUSHYANT               FAO(OS)(COMM) 107/2019                                            Page 11 of 28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">RAWAL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n                                 not made available to the auditors. The report shows that audits\n                                of the books of the sub-contractors was not within the scope of\n                                the work of the Auditors. Lastly, it has been forcefully argued\n                                and the same deserves acceptance that <a href=\"/doc/1216959/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 12</a>.1 of the CA\n                                relating to Annuity does not authorize the respondent DSIIDC\n                                not to pay the due Annuity when as per provisions of the\n                                agreement the Concessionaire had achieved the Annuity\n                                Commencement Date.

The Arbitral Tribunal had also considered and rejected\n                          DSIIDC&#x27;s contention that it was entitled to withhold the annuity as\n                          there was a failure on the part of the respondent to get the books\n                          audited by DSIIDC&#x27;s auditors. There is no dispute that the respondent\n                          had produced its books of accounts for audit by the auditors appointed\n                          by DSIIDC. The principal grievance was that the supporting bills of\n                          the sub-contractors had not been produced. The Arbitral Tribunal\n                          found that the report furnished by the auditors clearly indicated that\n                          the audit of the books of sub-contractors was not within their scope.\n                          We are unable to accept that the view of the Arbitral Tribunal is\n                          palpably erroneous or vitiates the award on the ground of patent\n                          illegality.

The contention that the impugned award is beyond the claims\n                          made by the respondent is also insubstantial. A plain reading of Claim\n                          no.1, as set out in the impugned award, indicates that the respondent\n                          had claimed annuities that had fallen due up to 28.02.2017 aggregating\n                          to ₹86,00,00,000/- and had sought a further direction for payment of\n                          future annuities in terms of the Concession Agreement. Thus, the\n                          award directing DSIIDC to pay future annuities in terms of\n                          Concession Agreement, cannot be faulted. The contention that no\n                          directions could be issued for payment of future annuities as the same\n                          were contingent upon the respondent complying with the conditions of\n                          the Concession Agreement, is unmerited. The Arbitral Tribunal has\n                          not issued any blanket orders directing payment of future annuities.\n                          The respondent had sought an award for payment of future annuities\n                          &quot;in terms of the Concession Agreement&quot; and the same was awarded.\n                          Thus, there is no direction to DSIIDC to pay future annuities\n                          notwithstanding that the same are not due in terms of the Concession\n                          Agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">                          29.   In our view, this amply clarifies that DSIIDC would be liable to\n                          pay annuities in accordance with the Concession Agreement and not in\n                          disregard of the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">                          30.   The second question to be examined is in regard to payment of\n                          award in respect of Claim no.2. The respondent had claimed\n                          maintenance charges for the period of 01.11.2013 to 13.03.2014,\n                          which it had quantified at 3,95,98,859/-.

According to\n                          DSIIDC, the maintenance charges could be collected only after\n                          completion of the project. In addition, DSIIDC also contested the\n                          quantum of the maintenance charges. There is no dispute that if it is\n                          accepted that the ACD is 31.10.2013, the respondent would also be\n                          entitled to collect maintenance charges from the said date. As held\n                          above, the Arbitral Tribunal&#x27;s decision in accepting the ACD as\n                          31.10.2013, cannot be interfered with in these proceedings.\n                          Accordingly, DSIIDC&#x27;s challenge to the impugned award in respect of\n                          Claim no.2 must fail as well.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">                          31.   Insofar as DSIIDC&#x27;s contention regarding quantum of\n                          maintenance charges is concerned, the Arbitral Tribunal had duly\n                          considered the same and had not accepted the respondent&#x27;s claim to\n                          the full extent and had confined the amount realized by DSIIDC. The\n                          same was quantified at ₹1,00,95,715/-, which was subsequently\n                          rectified to ₹1,41,70,767/- by an order dated 17.11.2018 passed by the\n                          Arbitral Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/181078/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 33</a> of the A&amp;C Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">                          RE: CLAIM NO.3\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_43\">                          32.

The respondent had availed of a loan of ₹140 crores from OBC\n                          in terms of the Loan Agreement dated 10.12.2011. As noted earlier,\n                          the loan was to be repaid in 121 monthly installments commencing\n                          from 31.12.2013.

The respondent had pleaded that it was\n                          an accepted practice in infrastructure project finance that on the\n                          successful completion of the project, the banks/financial institutions\n                          financing such projects reduce the rate of interest commensurate with\n                          the mitigation of risks and commencement of revenue inflows. Once a\n                          project is completed, the risks of time and cost overruns cease, and it\n                          is the usual practice for banks to reduce the interest on the facilities\n                          extended to the project developer.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">                          33.   The respondent claimed that it had made a request to OBC for\n                          reducing the rate of interest but the same was turned down on the\n                          ground that the first annuity of ₹21.5 crores had not been deposited in\n                          the account.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_45\">                          34.   The respondent relied upon a letter dated 25.04.2014 addressed\n                          to OBC informing the said bank that the project was completed\n                          successfully on 31.10.2013 and requesting that the rate of interest\n                          (which was pegged at base rate plus 75 basis points) be reduced to the\n                          base rate with effect from 01.04.2014 onwards. The respondent\n                          claimed that the applicable rate of interest (base rate plus 75 basis\n                          point) worked out to 11% per annum as on 31.03.2014. If OBC had\n                          acceded to the said request, the said rate would be reduced to 10.25%\n                          per annum. However, OBC did not accede to the request.

However, the said\n                          payment had not been released by DSIIDC even after more than seven\n                          months of the completion of the project. Accordingly, OBC informed\n                          the respondent that it was concerned regarding the delay and was not\n                          aware of the reasons for the same. It was further stated that once the\n                          respondent confirmed the receipt of the due annuity payment, the\n                          respondent&#x27;s request for resetting of interest would be &quot;processed for\n                          consideration&quot;. The respondent claimed that since DSIIDC had not\n                          released the annuity payments, OBC had not reduced the rate of\n                          interest by 75 basis points, resulting in the respondent suffering a loss\n                          of ₹2,56,34,720/-.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">                          35.   DSIIDC had resisted the aforesaid claim, principally, on the\n                          ground that the respondent was not entitled to payment of annuity,\n                          which was DSIIDC&#x27;s defence to the respondent&#x27;s Claim no.1. The\n                          Arbitral Tribunal rejected DSIIDC&#x27;s defence as discussed above. The\n                          Arbitral Tribunal concluded that the respondent had suffered some\n                          loss on account of OBC not considering the respondent&#x27;s request for\n                          reduction of interest as DSIIDC had not released the annuity payments\n                          due to the respondent. However, the Arbitral Tribunal found that the\n                          respondent&#x27;s claim was not free from doubt as it was open for the\n                          bank to reduce the rates of interest as per its discretion and not\n                          necessarily by 75 basis point, as requested by the respondent. In view\n                          of the above, the Arbitral Tribunal considered it apposite to allow 50%\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_88\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_89\">By:DUSHYANT               FAO(OS)(COMM) 107/2019                                     Page 18 of 28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">RAWAL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n                           of the amount claimed and awarded a sum of ₹1,28,17,360/- in favour\n                          of the respondent. The relevant extract of the decision of the Arbitral\n                          Tribunal is set out below:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">                                  &quot;36. The credit rating of Claimant company was not revised\n                                  upwards till the filing of the claim nor the respondent\n                                  released any of the Annuity payments. In such\n                                  circumstances, the Claimant failed to obtain any reduction\n                                  in the interest rate. The third claim is based on facts which\n                                  are not in much dispute. Hence, it can be safely and\n                                  reasonably held that Claimant has suffered some losses as\n                                  advanced in Claim No.3. But what would be the quantum of\n                                  such loss is not free from doubt because it was open for the\n                                  bank to reduce the rate of interest as per its discretion and\n                                  not necessarily by 75 basis points as claimed by the\n                                  Claimant. On account of such uncertainty, in spite of\n                                  accepting the prevailing industry practice, it is deemed just\n                                  and proper to allow only 50% of Claim No.3. In paragraph-\n                                  63 of the Claim Petition, the Claimant has itself made an\n                                  averment that after the commissioning of a Project by a\n                                  borrower, Banks consider &quot;some reduction&quot; in the rate of\n                                  interest applicable on a loan agreement of such borrower.\n                                  Hence, Claim No.3 is allowed only in part to the extent of\n                                  Rs.1,28,17,360/-.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_48\">                          36.   It is apparent from the above that the Arbitral Tribunal did not\n                          consider the incidence and the nature of the damages claimed by the\n                          respondent. It is apparent that the respondent&#x27;s claim was for an\n                          indirect loss and in the nature of special damages. There was no\n                          material on record to establish that the respondent, as a matter of right,\n                          was entitled to reduction of the rate of interest charged by OBC, on\n                          DSIIDC releasing the first annuity.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">By:DUSHYANT               FAO(OS)(COMM) 107/2019                                        Page 19 of 28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">RAWAL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">                           37.   It is also important to note that the question of rate of interest is\n                          a matter strictly between OBC and the respondent and would be\n                          dependent on several factors. The rate of interest at which loan is\n                          advanced by the lender is a matter of negotiations and agreement\n                          between the borrower and the lender. Of course, the credit rating of a\n                          borrower in the said context may be material. DSIIDC is not involved\n                          in determining the rate of interest charged by OBC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">                          38.   Admittedly, OBC had no obligation to reduce the rate of interest\n                          on release of the first annuity installment by DSIIDC. There is no\n                          document or material which records any such commitment on the part\n                          of OBC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">                          39.   It is clear that the claim raised by the respondent of a possible\n                          reduction of rate of interest if DSIIDC had released the annuity on\n                          time, is a speculative claim. There is also no communication on record\n                          from OBC committing to reduce the rate of interest on the release of\n                          the first annuity. There is also no communication or material on record\n                          to establish that if DSIIDC had released the annuity in time, OBC was\n                          obliged to reduce the rate of interest on the loan advanced to the\n                          respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">                          40.   It is important to note that the claim of compensation for the\n                          alleged loss suffered by the respondent, is not a direct incidence of\n                          failure on the part of DSIIDC to comply with its obligation to release\n                          the first annuity payment. The damages suffered are clearly remote\n                          and not proximate to breach on the part of DSIIDC to release the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_97\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_98\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">By:DUSHYANT               FAO(OS)(COMM) 107/2019                                       Page 20 of 28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">RAWAL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n                           annuity payment as agreed. It is also apparent that claim would not lie\n                          unless DSIIDC was specifically put to notice of a possible loss and\n                          such loss was in contemplation of the parties. This court had pointedly\n                          asked the counsel for the respondent whether there was any\n                          contemporaneous communication at the time when the first annuity\n                          payment was due, informing DSIIDC that failure on its part would\n                          result in a loss on account of non-reduction of interest rate by OBC.\n                          He fairly conceded that there is no such communication on record,\n                          whereby the respondent had informed DSIIDC that its failure to\n                          release the annuity would result in depriving the respondent in\n                          securing a reduced rate of interest from OBC and a financial loss to\n                          the extent as claimed. Without DSIIDC being put to prior notice, the\n                          respondent&#x27;s claim for loss of such a nature would not lie.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">                          41.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1019103\" id=\"span_102\">In <a href=\"/doc/1019103/\" id=\"a_28\">State of Kerala v.

The rule that is applicable can be\n                                summarised as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">                                     &#x27;The defendant is liable only for &quot;natural and\n                                     proximate consequences of a breach or those\n                                     consequences which were in the parties&#x27;\n                                     contemplation at the time of contract.&quot; The above\n                                     quoted phrases are words of art and usually represent\n                                     two ways of expressing a single requirement.\n                                     Proximate and natural consequences are those that\n                                     flow directly or closely from the breach in the usual\n                                     and normal course of events -- those which a\n                                     &#x27;reasonable man&#x27; or a person of ordinary prudence\n                                     would when the bargain is made foresee, as\n                                     expectable results of later breach. The phrase &#x27;in the\n                                     parties&#x27; contemplation&#x27; normally means in the\n                                     reasonable contemplation of the defendant. Thus\n                                     understood, it has got only the same meaning as the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_108\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">By:DUSHYANT               FAO(OS)(COMM) 107/2019                                       Page 22 of 28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">RAWAL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n                                      companion phrase &#x27;natural and proximate&#x27;.

The defendant in the said\n                          case had failed to deliver 200 tons of scrap iron. At the material time,\n                          the price of iron scrap was controlled. The defendant claimed that the\n                          plaintiff could not claim any loss as the price of scrap iron on the date\n                          of the contract and on the date when it was breached was the same. It\n                          was plaintiff&#x27;s case that it had entered into a contract for export of\n                          scrap iron with Export Corporation relying on the supply from the\n                          defendant.

The Export Corporation\n                          had purchased the scrap iron from the market and recovered the\n                          difference in the price at which it had agreed to purchase the goods\n                          from the plaintiff and the price at which it had purchased from the\n                          market, from the plaintiff. It was urged that the Iron and Steel (Scrap\n                          Control) Order, 1943 applies only to cases of sale of scrap iron used\n                          within the country. The Court held that the plaintiff was not entitled to\n                          damages equal to the difference between the price paid by his vendees\n                          (Export Corporation) and the price that he would have paid to the\n                          defendant for goods in question (200 tons of scrap iron). The Court\n                          held that unless the plaintiff had entered into a contract with the\n                          defendant after informing the latter that that he was purchasing the\n                          scrap iron for export (if there was no control price applicable to such\n                          purchases for export) the plaintiff could not claim such damages.

In the present case, the Arbitral Tribunal has failed to consider\n                          that the damages claimed were remote and were not those that arose in\n                          the usual course of things from such breach or those that were in the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_129\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_130\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">By:DUSHYANT               FAO(OS)(COMM) 107/2019                                         Page 26 of 28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_132\">RAWAL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_133\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n                           contemplation of the parties at the time they entered into the\n                          Concession Agreement. The Arbitral Tribunal had compensated the\n                          respondent for the delay in release of annuity by awarding interest\n                          which naturally arises from withholding the amounts due to DSIIDC.\n                          Further compensation as claimed by the respondent was not proximate\n                          to the breach on the part of DSIIDC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">                          46.   In addition to the above, there is also no certainty as to the\n                          quantum of loss suffered assuming that the respondent has suffered the\n                          same. The Arbitral Tribunal also acknowledged this aspect, however,\n                          proceeded to award 50% of the claim amount. The said measure is not\n                          founded on any material or evidence.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">                          47.

The Arbitral Tribunal had also awarded interest and DSIIDC\n                          had assailed the impugned award in this regard as well. However, we\n                          find no infirmity with the award of interest on the award as sustained.\n                          It is not necessary to examine DSIIDC&#x27;s challenge to the award of\n                          interest in any detail because as stated at the outset, the learned\n                          counsel had confined the present appeal to assailing the impugned\n                          award in respect of only three claims (Claim nos. 1, 2 and 3).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">                          49.   We also find no ground to interfere with the impugned award\n                          insofar as award of costs is concerned. The Arbitral Tribunal had\n                          rejected DSIIDC&#x27;s claim that it was entitled to withhold annuity\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_135\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_136\">By:DUSHYANT               FAO(OS)(COMM) 107/2019                                    Page 27 of 28</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_137\">RAWAL</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">Signing Date:25.04.2024</span>\n                           payment or the maintenance charges. It is well settled that costs follow\n                          events. The respondent had succeeded in its principal claims and the\n                          counterclaims raised by DSIIDC were rejected. The dispute being a\n                          commercial dispute, the respondent would be entitled to reasonable\n                          costs for being compelled to take recourse to its remedies.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_66\">                          50.

The impugned judgment to the extent it rejects DSIIDC&#x27;s\n                          challenge to award against Claim no. 3 is erroneous and is set aside\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_67\">                          51.
