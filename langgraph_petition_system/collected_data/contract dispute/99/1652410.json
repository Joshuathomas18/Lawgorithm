Upon  the termination of his services  by\t the\nappellant,  the respondent brought a suit for  accounts\t and\npayment\t of the profits found due to him.  The appellant  by\nan\n714\napplication  pleaded that the suit ought to be stayed  under<a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_3\">\nS. 34</a> of the Arbitration Act, 1940, and the dispute referred\nto arbitration in accordance with the agreement between\t the\nparties.  The trial judge refused to exercise his discretion\nin favour of the appellant and refused to stay the suit.  On\nappeal\tthe High Court confirmed the decision of  the  trial\ncourt.\tThe appellant came up to this Court by special leave\nunder <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_4\">Art. 136</a> of the Constitution:\nHeld, that the power conferred on the court by<a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_5\"> S. 34</a> Of\t the\nArbitration Act, 1940, is discretionary and even though\t the\nconditions  specified therein were fulfilled no party  could\nclaim there under a stay of legal proceedings instituted  in\na court as a matter of right.  But the discretion vested  in\nthe court is a judicial discretion and must be exercised  as\nsuch  in  the  facts and circumstances\tof  each  case.\t  No\ninflexible  rules  can,\t therefore, be laid down  f  or\t its\nexercise and the court has to act according to common  sense\nand justice.\nGardner v. Jay, (1885) 29 Ch.  D. 50, referred to\nWhere the discretion under the section has been properly and\njudiciously exercised by the trial court the appellate court\nwould not be justified in interfering with such exercise  of\ndiscretion  merely on the ground that it would have taken  a\ncontrary  decision  if it had considered the matter  at\t the\ntrial stage.  But if it appears to the appellate court\tthat\nthe trial court has exercised its discretion unreasonably or\ncapriciously or has ignored relevant facts or has approached\nthe matter unjudiciously, it would be its duty to interfere.\nCharles\t Osenton  &amp;  Co.  v. jhanaton,\t(1942)\tA.  C.\t130,\nreferred to.\nThe  words &quot; interpretation and application of the  contract\nfrequently used in arbitration clauses, as they have been in\nthe contracts in question, cover not only disputes  relating\nto  the construction of the relevant terms of  the  contract\nbut  also  their effect, and unless the\t context  compels  a\ncontrary construction, a dispute relating to the working  of\nthe contract falls within such a clause.\nBut the Supreme Court would not lightly interfere under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_6\">Art.\n136</a> of the Constitution with the concurrent exercise of dis-\ncretion of the courts below under<a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_7\"> s. 34</a> Of the Act.   Before\nit  can justly do so, the appellant must satisfy the  Court,\non the relevant facts referred to by the courts below,\tthat\nthey exercised their discretion in a manifestly unreasonable\nor  perverse  way  which was likely to defeat  the  ends  of\njustice.\n\n\n\nJUDGMENT:</pre>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">CIVIL APPELLATE JURISDICTION: Civil Appeal No. 107 of 1960.\nAppeal\tby special leave from the judgment and\torder  dated\nSeptember 21, 1959, of the Mysore High Court, Bangalore,  in\nMisc.

The Judgment of the Court was delivered by\nGAJENDRAGADKAR,\t J.  The respondent, Pothan Joseph, who\t was\nworking\t as  the  Editor  of the  Deccan  Herald  owned\t and\npublished  by the appellant, The&#x27; Printers (Mysore)  Private\nLtd., in Bangalore has filed a suit against the appellant on\ntwo contracts executed between the parties on April 1, 1948,\nand  February  20,  1953,  respectively,  and  has   claimed\naccounts of the working of the Deccan Herald newspaper\tfrom\nApril 1, 1948, to March 31, 1958, as well as payment of\t the\namount\tthat  may  be found due to him\tfrom  the  appellant\ntinder\tthe  provisions of cls. 2(d) and 1(d)  of  the\tsaid\ncontracts.   The services of the respondent were  terminated\nby the appellant by its letter dated September 28, 1957,  in\nwhich  the  respondent was told that the  termination  would\ntake  effect from March 31, 1958.  However, by a  subsequent\nletter\twritten by the appellant to the respondent on  March\n17, 1958, the respondent was told that his services had been\nterminated  with immediate effect and he was asked  to\thand\nover  charge  to his successor, Mr. T. S.  Ramachandra\tRao.\nThereafter  on\tJuly  14, 1958, the  respondent,  filed\t the\npresent suit against the appellant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">The appellant contended that the two contracts on which\t the\nrespondent&#x27;s claim was based were subject to an\t arbitration\nagreement, and so it was not open to the respondent to\tfile\nthe  present  suit against the\tappellant.   The  appellant,\ntherefore,  requested  the Court under<a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_8\"> s. 34</a> of\t the  Indian\nArbitration Act, 1940, (hereinafter called the Act), to stay\nthe  proceedings initiated by the respondent and  refer\t the\ndispute\t to arbitration in accordance with  the\t arbitration\nagreement between the parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">The   learned\ttrial  judge  who  heard   the\t appellant&#x27;s\napplication,  however, exercised his discretion\t against  it\nand  refused  to stay the proceedings  in  the\trespondent&#x27;s\nsuit.\tThereupon the appellant preferred an appeal  in\t the\nMysore\tHigh Court but his appeal failed and the High  Court\nconfirmed  the\torder passed by the trial court\t though\t for\ndifferent reasons.  The High\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">716</span>\nCourt,\thowever,  thought that the learned trial  judge,  in\ndealing\t with  the appellant&#x27;s application &quot; bad  gone\tmuch\nfurther than he should have done, and hence it was desirable\nthat  the  case should be tried by some other judge  &quot;.\t The\nrespondent  did not object, and so the High  Court  directed\nthat  the  suit\t may  be transferred  to  the  file  of\t the\nAdditional  Civil  Judge,  Bangalore.\tThe  appellant\tthen\napplied\t  to  the  High\t Court\tfor  a\t certificate.\t His\napplication  was, however, rejected on the ground  that\t the\ndecision under appeal could not be considered as a judgment,\ndecree or final order under <a href=\"/doc/1011888/\" id=\"a_9\">Art. 133(1)</a> of the\tConstitution\n; on that view it was thought unnecessary to decide  whether\non the merits the case was fit to be taken in appeal to this\nCourt.\tThen the appellant applied for and obtained  special\nleave  from  this Court.  That is how this appeal  has\tcome\nbefore\tus; and the substantial point which arises  for\t our\ndecision  is  whether  the courts below\t were  in  error  in\nrefusing  to stay the suit filed by the\t respondent  against\nthe  appellant in view of the arbitration agreement  between\nthem.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">Before we deal with the merits of the contentions raised  by\nthe  parties  in  this appeal it is  necessary\tto  set\t out\nbriefly\t  the\trelevant  facts\t leading  to   the   present\nlitigation.  The appellant is a printing company and it owns\nand publishes the Deccan Herald in English and Prajavani  in\nKannada\t at Bangalore.\tBy a contract dated April  1,  1948,\nthe appellant engaged the respondent as Editor of the Deccan\nHerald\tfor a period of five years on terms  and  conditions\nspecified  in the said contract.  As provided by el. (5)  of\nthe said contract the period of the respondent&#x27;s  employment\nwas extended by another five years by a subsequent  contract\nentered\t into between the parties on February 20, 1953.\t  As\nwe  have  already mentioned the services of  the  respondent\ncame  to  be  terminated abruptly on  March  17,  1958.\t  It\nappears\t that  by  his letter dated October  16,  1957,\t the\nrespondent  made certain claims against the appellant  under\nthe provisions of the Working Journalists Act.\tBesides,  he\ndemanded  1/10th  of the profits made by the  Deccan  Herald\nfrom  1948 up to the date of the termination of his  service\nunder the two respective contracts.  This claim was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">717</span>\ndenied by the appellant.  Correspondence then ensued between\nthe  parties  but  since no  common  ground  was  discovered\nbetween\t them  the respondent filed the present\t suit.\t His\ncase is that the two contracts entitled him to claim  1/10th\nof  the profits made by the Deccan Herald during the  period\nof his employment,, and so he claims an account of the\tsaid\nprofits and his due share in them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">The   learned\ttrial  judge  found  that   the\t  respective\ncontentions  raised  by the parties before him\tshowed\tthat\nthere  was  no\tdispute as such\t between  them\twhich  could\nattract\t the  arbitration agreement.  He also held  that  an\nattempt was made by the parties to settle their\t differences\namicably through the mediation of Mr. Behram Doctor but\t the\nsaid  attempt failed because the appellant was\tnot  serious\nabout it and was just trying &quot; to protract, defeat and delay\nthe  plaintiff\t&#x27;s moves&quot;.  According to the  learned  trial\njudge  a plea of limitation would fall to be  considered  in\nthe  present  suit and it was desirable that the  said\tplea\nshould\tbe  tried  by  a  competent  court  rather  than  by\narbitrators.\tHe  was,  however,  not\t impressed  by\t the\nrespondent&#x27;s   contention  that\t his  character\t  had\tbeen\nimpeached  by the appellant and so he should be\t allowed  to\nvindicate  his\tcharacter in a trial before a  court  rather\nthan before the arbitrators.  In dismissing the\t appellant&#x27;s\nclaim  for stay of the suit the learned judge observed\tthat\nif the accounts of the Deccan Herald had not been separately\nmaintained it would be competent for a qualified  accountant\nto   allocate  expenses\t and  capital  expenses\t among\t the\ndifferent  activities of the appellant and then very  little\nwould  be left for arbitrators to decide.  He had  no  doubt\nthat  the contract by which the respondent was\tentitled  to\nclaim  1/10th  share  in the profits of\t the  Deccan  Herald\nnecessarily  postulated\t that  the accounts  of\t the  Deccan\nHerald\t would\t be   separately   maintained.\t  On   these\nconsiderations the trial judge refused to stay the suit.\nWhen the matter went in appeal the High Court held that\t the\ndispute\t between  the  parties\tdid  not  fall\twithin\t the\narbitration  agreement.\t The High Court also considered\t the\nother  points decided by the trial court; it held  that\t Mr,\nBehram Doctor had not been\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">93</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">718</span>\nappointed as an arbitrator between the parties and that\t the\nproceedings  before him merely showed that the parties\twere\nexploring  the\tpossibility of having  an  arbitration.\t  It\nobserved  that the appellant company was a big\tconcern\t and\nreferred  to the respondent&#x27;s apprehension that it was in  a\nposition to dodge the respondent&#x27;s claim.  However, the High\nCourt  was not impressed by these apprehensions, and it\t was\nnot inclined to find fault with the conduct of the appellant\nin  the\t trial court.  It was also not\tsatisfied  that\t the\nquestion of limitation which would arise in the suit as well\nas  the question of interpreting the contracts could not  be\nproperly tried by arbitration.\tIt recognised that there had\nbeen a complete change of front on the part of the appellant\nin  regard  to the pleas raised by the appellant  under\t the\narbitration  agreement when the matter was discussed  before\nMr. Behram Doctor, and when it reached the court in the form\nof  the present suit.  The High Court then considered  other\nfacts which it thought were relevant.  It stated that  there\nwas  great deal of bad blood between the parties  and  there\nwas  no meeting ground between them.  The  appellant&#x27;s\tplea\nthat  recourse to arbitration may help an early disposal  of\nthe  dispute did not appeal to the High Court as sound,\t and\nso,  on\t the whole, the High Court thought  that  the  order\npassed\tby the trial court refusing to stay the\t proceedings\nin  suit should be confirmed.  The appellant  contends\tthat\nthe reasons given by the High Court in refusing to stay\t the\nsuit  are not convincing and that the discretion vesting  in\nthe  High  Court  in that behalf has not  been\tproperly  or\njudiciously exercised.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\"><a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_10\">Section\t 34</a>  of the Act confers power on the court  to\tstay\nlegal  proceedings where there is an  arbitration  agreement\nsubject\t to  the conditions specified in the  section.\t The\nconditions thus specified are satisfied in the present case,\nbut the section clearly contemplates that, even though there\nis  an\tarbitration agreement and the  requisite  conditions\nspecified  by it are satisfied, the court  may\tnevertheless\nrefuse\tto  grant  stay if it is satisfied  that  there\t are\nsufficient reasons why the matter should not be referred  in\naccordance with the arbitration agreement.  In other  words,\nthe power to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">719</span>\nstay  legal proceedings is discretionary, and so a party  to\nan arbitration agreement against whom legal proceedings have\nbeen   commenced  cannot  by  relying  on  the\t arbitration\nagreement claim the stay of legal proceedings instituted  in\na  court as a matter of right.\tIt is, however,\t clear\tthat\nthe  discretion\t vested in the court, must be  properly\t and\njudicially  exercised.\tOrdinarily where a  dispute  between\nthe parties has by agreement between them to be referred  to\nthe  decision of a domestic tribunal the court would  direct\nthe  parties to go before the tribunal of their\t choice\t and\nstay  the legal proceedings instituted before it by  one  of\nthem.  As in other matters of judicial discretion, so in the\ncase  of the discretion conferred on the court by<a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_11\"> s.  34</a>  it\nwould  be  difficult, and it is indeed inexpedient,  to\t lay\ndown  any inflexible rules which should govern the  exercise\nof the said discretion.\t No test can indeed be laid down the\nautomatic application of which will help the solution of the\nproblem\t of  the exercise of judicial  discretion.   As\t was\nobserved  by  Bowen,  L. J., in Gardner v. Jay\t(1)  &quot;\tthat\ndiscretion,   like  other  judicial  discretion,   must\t  be\nexercised  according  to  common  sense\t and  according\t  to\njustice.  &quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">In  exercising its discretion under<a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_12\"> s. 34</a> the  court  should\nnot refuse to stay the legal proceedings merely because\t one\nof the parties to the arbitration agreement is unwilling  to\ngo  before an arbitrator and in effect wants to resile\tfrom\nthe  said agreement, nor can stay be refused merely  on\t the\nground that the relations between the parties to the dispute\nhave  been  embittered or that the  proceedings\t before\t the\narbitrator  may cause unnecessary delay as a result  of\t the\nsaid  relations.  It may not always be reasonable or  proper\nto  refuse  to stay legal proceedings  merely  because\tsome\nquestions  of  law  would arise\t in  resolving\tthe  dispute\nbetween\t the  parties.\t On  the other\thand,  if  fraud  or\ndishonesty is alleged against a party it may be open to\t the\nparty  whose character is impeached to claim that it  should\nbe  given  an opportunity to vindicate its character  in  an\nopen trial before the court rather than. before the domestic\ntribunal, and in a proper case the. court may consider\tthat\nfact as relevant for deciding\n(1)  (1885) 29 Ch.  D 30 58,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">720</span>\nwhether stay should be granted or not.\tIf there has been  a\nlong  delay in making an application for stay and  the\tsaid\ndelay  may  reasonably be attributed to the  fact  that\t the\nparties\t may  have abandoned the arbitration  agreement\t the\ncourt may consider the delay as a relevant fact in  deciding\nwhether\t stay  should  be granted  or  not.   Similarly,  if\ncomplicated questions of law or constitutional issues  arise\nin  the decision of the dispute and the court  is  satisfied\nthat  it would be inexpedient to leave the decision of\tsuch\ncomplex issues to the arbitrator, it may, in a proper  case,\nrefuse\tto grant stay on that ground; indeed, in such  cases\nthe  arbitrator\t can and may state a special  case  for\t the\nopinion\t of the court under<a href=\"/doc/1611763/\" id=\"a_13\"> s. 13(b)</a> of the Act.  Thus,\t the\nquestion  as to whether legal proceedings should  be  stayed\nunder  s.  34  must  always be decided by  the\tcourt  in  a\njudicial  manner  having regard to the\trelevant  facts\t and\ncircumstances of each case.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">Where  the  discretion vested in the court under<a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_14\"> s.  34</a>\t has\nbeen exercised by the trial court the appellate court should\nbe  slow  to  interfere\t with  the  exercise  of  the\tsaid\ndiscretion.  In dealing with the matter raised before it  at\nthe  appellate stage the appellate court would normally\t not\nbe justified in interfering with the exercise of  discretion\nunder appeal solely on the ground that if it had  considered\nthe  matter  at\t the trial stage it would  have\t come  to  a\ncontrary  conclusion.  If the discretion has been  exercised\nby  the trial court reasonably and in a judicial manner\t the\nfact  that the appellate court would have taken a  different\nview  may  not justify interference with the  trial  court&#x27;s\nexercise of discretion.\t As is often said, it is  ordinarily\nnot  open  to  the appellate court  to\tsubstitute  its\t own\nexercise  of discretion for that of the trial judge; but  if\nit  appears  to the appellate court that in  exercising\t its\ndiscretion  the\t trial\tcourt  has  acted  unreasonably\t  or\ncapriciously  or has ignored relevant facts and has  adopted\nan  unjudicial approach then it would certainly be  open  to\nthe appellate court-and in many cases it may be its  duty-to\ninterfere with the trial court&#x27;s exercise of discretion.  In\ncases falling under this class the exercise of discretion by\nthe trial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">721</span>\ncourt  is  in  law  wrongful and  improper  and\t that  would\ncertainly  justify  and\t call  for  interference  from\t the\nappellate  court.   These principles are  well\testablished;\nbut,  as  has  been observed by Viscount Simon,\t L.  C.,  in\nCharles\t Osenton &amp; Co. v. Johnston (1) &quot; the law as  to\t the\nreversal  by a court of appeal of an order made by a,  judge\nbelow in the exercise of his discretion is well established,\nand   any  difficulty  that  arises  is\t due  only  to\t the\napplication  of\t well settled principles  in  an  individual\ncase&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">In  the present case there is one more fact which has to  be\nborne in mind in dealing with the merits of the\t controversy\nbefore us.  The appellant has come to this Court by  special\nleave  under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_15\">Art. 136;</a> in other words, the appellant is\t not\nentitled to challenge the correctness of the decision of the\nHigh  Court  as\t a  matter of right.   It  is  only  in\t the\ndiscretion of this Court that it can be permitted to dispute\nthe correctness or the propriety of the decision of the High\nCourt,\tand so in deciding whether or not this Court  should\ninterfere  with the order under appeal it would be  relevant\nfor us to take into account the fact that the remedy  sought\nfor   by  the  appellant  is  by  an  appeal  which   is   a\ndiscretionary matter so far as this Court is concerned.\t  It\nis  in the light of these principles that we  must  consider\nwhether\t or not the appellant&#x27;s complaint against  the\tHigh\nCourt&#x27;s order can be upheld.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">The  first point which calls for a decision relates  to\t the\nconstruction  of the contracts between the parties.   As  we\nhave already stated two contracts were executed between them\nbut  their  terms are substantially the same and so  we\t may\ndeal  with  the subsequent contract which  was\texecuted  on\nFebruary 20, 1953 (P. 2). Under this contract the respondent\nwas  engaged  as  the Editor of the Deccan  Herald  and\t his\nsalary\twas fixed at Rs. 1,500 permensem under\tparagraph  1\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_12\">(a).   Paragraph 1(b) and (c) deal with the other  amenities\nto  which  the\trespondent  was\t entitled.   Clause  (d)  of\nparagraph 1 provides that when the newspaper shows a  profit\nin  the\t annual\t accounts the Editor shall  be\tentitled  to\n1/10th\tshare of it is on this clause that the\trespondent&#x27;s\nclaim in the present proceedings is\n(1)  [1942] A.C 130, 138.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">722</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">based.\t The terms on which the respondent had to remain  in\nthe service of the appellant are specified in paragraph 2(a)\nand  (b).   Paragraph  3 provides for  the  renewal  of\t the\ncontract  for a further period of five years if it is  found\nthat  such  renewal  is\t for the  mutual  advantage  of\t the\nparties.   This\t paragraph  also provides  that\t during\t the\ncontinuance  of\t his  employment the  respondent  shall\t not\ndirectly or indirectly be interested in any other  newspaper\nbusiness   than\t  that\tof  the\t appellant  or\t any   other\njournalistic  activities  in competition with  that  of\t the\nappellant.   It\t also  stipulates that if  the\tcontract  is\ndetermined  the respondent shall not for a period  of  three\nyears thereafter be directly or indirectly interested in any\nnewspaper business of the same kind as is carried on by\t the\nappellant  within the Mysore State.  It would thus  be\tseen\nthat  this  paragraph  shows the liability  imposed  on\t the\nrespondent  as a consideration for the benefit conferred  on\nhim  by\t paragraph  1 in general and cl.  (d)  of  the\tsaid\nparagraph   in\t particular.   Paragraph   4   contains\t  an\narbitration   agreement.   It  provides\t that  if   in\t the\ninterpretation or application of the contract any difference\nof  opinion  arises between the parties the  same  shall  be\nreferred  to  arbitration.  The arbitrator can be  named  by\nboth  the  parties  but if they failed to  choose  the\tsame\nperson each side will choose an arbitrator and the two\twill\nelect  another\tperson to complete the panel.\tTheir  award\nshall be final and binding on both the parties.\nThe High Court has held that the present suit is outside the\narbitration  agreement\tbecause neither party  disputes\t the\napplicability  of the terms of the contract in the  decision\nof the dispute.\t The High Court thought that in the  context\nthe  words &#x27;application of the contract&#x27; meant a dispute  as\nto  the\t applicability\tof  the\t contract,  and\t since\t the\napplicability  of  the contract was not in question  and  no\ndispute as to the interpretation of the contract arose,\t the\nHigh  Court  held that paragraph 4 was inapplicable  to\t the\npresent suit.  Mr. Purshottam, for the appellant, con. tends\nthat the construction placed by the High Court on the word &quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">application   &quot;\t is  erroneous.\t  According  to\t  him,\t any\ndifference  of opinion in regard to the application  of\t the\ncontract must in the context mean\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">723</span>\nthe,  working  out of the contract or giving effect  to\t its\nterms.\t In  our opinion, this contention is  well  founded.\nThe  words &#x27;interpretation or application of  the  contract&#x27;\nare  frequently\t used  in arbitration  agreements  and\tthey\ngenerally  cover disputes between the parties in  regard  to\nthe  construction of the relevant terms of the\tcontract  as\nwell  as their effect, and unless the con-&#x27; text  compels  a\ncontrary construction, a dispute in regard to the working of\nthe  contract  would  generally fall within  the  clause  in\nquestion.  It is not easy to appreciate what kind of dispute\naccording to the High Court would have attracted paragraph 4\nwhen it refers to a difference of opinion in the application\nof  the\t contract.  Since both the parties have\t signed\t the\ncontract  the question about its applicability in that\tform\ncan  hardly arise.  Differences may, however, arise  and  in\nfact have arisen as to the manner in which the contract\t has\nto  be worked out and given effect to, and it  is  precisely\nsuch  differences  that\t are  covered  by  the\t arbitration\nagreement.   We would accordingly hold that the\t High  Court\nwas  in error in coming to the conclusion that\tthe  present\ndispute\t between  the  parties\twas  outside  the  scope  of\nparagraph 4 of the contract.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">If   the  High\tCourt  had  refused  to\t stay  the   present\nproceedings only on this ground the appellant would no doubt\nhave  succeeded; but the High Court has based  its  decision\nnot  only,  nor\t even mainly, on  the  construction  of\t the\ncontract.  The tenor of the judgment suggests that the\tHigh\nCourt  considered  the\tother relevant facts  to  which\t its\nattention was invited and the material findings recorded  by\nthe  trial  judge, and though it differed from some  of\t the\nfindings  of  the  trial  judge, on the\t whole\tit  felt  no\ndifficulty  in\tcoming to the conclusion that there  was  no\nreason\tto  interfere  with the trial  court&#x27;s\texercise  of\ndiscretion  under  s.  34.  That is  why,  even\t though\t the\nappellant  has\tsucceeded before us on the question  of\t the\nconstruction of the arbitration agreement, having regard  to\nthe limits which we generally impose on the exercise of\t the\njurisdiction  under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_16\">Art. 136</a>, he must still satisfy us\tthat\nwe  would  be justified in interfering with  the  concurrent\nexercise  of  discretion by the two courts below,  and\tthat\nwould inevitably depend upon the other\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">724</span>\nrelevant  facts to which both the courts have referred,\t and\non which both of them have relied though in different ways.\nWhat  then are the broad features of the case on  which\t the\ntrial judge and the High Court have respectively relied ? It\nis  clear that the present dispute is not the result  of  an\nordinary  commercial transaction containing  an\t arbitration\nclause.\t  The contract in question is between  a  journalist\nand his employer by which the remuneration of the journalist\nhas been fixed in a somewhat unusual manner by giving him  a\nspecified  percentage in the profit which the Deccan  Herald\nwould  make from year to year.\tAccording to the  respondent\nhe  was\t surprised  when the General Manager  of  the  paper\ninformed him that 75% of the overall expenditure incurred in\nthe several activities of the appellant was being charged to\nthe  Deccan  Herald, and that the capital  liabilities\twere\ncharged in the same proportion; he thought that this  system\nof accounting adopted by the appellant was repugnant to\t the\nmaterial  provisions  in his contract.\tIndeed his  case  is\nthat after he came to know about this system he protested to\nthe  Director, Mr. Venkataswamy, who has been taking  active\npart  in the affairs of the appellant, and Mr.\tVenkataswamy\nassured him that as from the beginning of 1955 the  accounts\nwere being separately maintained.  It would appear that\t the\ninformation  received  by the respondent  from\tthe  General\nManager\t disillusioned\thim  and  that\tappears\t to  be\t the\nbeginning   of\tthe  present  dispute,\taccording   to\t the\nrespondent&#x27;s  letter of May 24, 1955, (D. 1).\tOn  February\n18,  1956, the respondent invoked the arbitration  agreement\nand told Mr. Venkataswamy that Mr. Behram Doctor had  agreed\nto  work  as  arbitrator and give his  award  (D.  2).\t Mr.\nVenkataswamy  who  was addressed by the\t respondent  as\t the\nManaging  Director told him by his reply of March  5,  1956,\nthat he was not the Managing Director and added that in his&#x27;\nview  it was not open to the respondent to invoke cl.  4  of\nthe  contract  because\the was aware  that  no\tmonies\twere\npayable to the respondent under el. 1(d).  It would thus  be\nseen that Mr. Venkataswamy&#x27;s immediate response to the\tres-\npondent&#x27;s request for arbitration was that the respon-\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">725</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">dent could not invoke the arbitration clause (D. 3).  It  is\ntrue  that on April 23, 1956, Mr. Venkataswamy attempted  to\nexplain\t this statement by saying that all that he  intended\nto suggest was that no occasion for invoking the arbitration\nagreement  had\tarisen.\t  That, however, appears  to  be  an\nunsatisfactory\t explanation   (D.  10).    Even   so,\t Mr.\nVenkataswamy  agreed  to meet Mr. Behram Doctor\t and  so  on\nMarch  9, 1956, the respondent gave to Mr. Venkataswamy\t the\naddress\t of Mr. Behram Doctor and asked him to see  him\t (D.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">5).   He informed Mr. Behram Doctor accordingly (D. 6).\t  It\nappears\t that subsequently Mr. Behrain Doctor met  both\t the\nrespondent  and\t Mr.  Venkataswamy  on\tMay  9,\t 1956.\t The\nproceedings  of\t this meeting which have been  kept  by\t Mr.\nBehram Doctor and copies of which have been supplied by\t him\nto  both  the  parties\tindicate  that\tMr.  Behram   Doctor\nattempted to mediate between the parties and presumably\t the\nparties were agreeable to secure the mediation of Mr. Behram\nDoctor\tto  resolve the dispute.  We ought to add  that\t the\ncopy  of  the  said proceedings produced  by  the  appellant\ncontains  a  statement that Mr. Venkataswamy at\t the  outset\ntold  Mr. Behram Doctor that he had; come on  an  unofficial\nvisit  and  was speaking without the consent  of  the  other\ndirectors.   This statement is, however, not to be found  in\nthe  copy supplied by Mr. Behram Doctor to  the\t respondent.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">Prima  facie  it is not easy to understand  why\t Mr.  Behram\nDoctor\tshould have omitted this material statement in\t the\ncopy supplied by him to the respondent.\t That, however, is a\nmatter\twhich  we do not propose to pursue  in\tthe  present\nappeal.\t It is thus clear that though Mr. Behram Doctor\t was\nnot appointed an arbitrator and no reference in writing\t was\nmade to him an attempt was made by the parties to settle the\ndispute\t with the assistance of Mr. Behram Doctor, and\tthat\nattempt failed.\t Having regard to the facts which have\tcome\non  the record it may not be unreasonable to infer that\t the\nappellant was not too keen to pursue the matter on the lines\noriginally  adopted  by both the parties before\t Mr.  Behram\nDoctor.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_15\">It  also  appears that for some years the, accounts  of\t the\nDeccan Herald had not been separately kept as\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">94</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">726</span>\nthey  should have been according to the\t respondent&#x27;s  case.\nThe  respondent\t alleges  that\tthey  have  not\t been\tkept\nseparately  throughout the ten years ; but that is a  matter\nwhich  is yet to be investigated.  If the accounts  are\t not\nseparately kept the question of allocating expenditure would\ninevitably arise and that can be decided after adopting some\nad  hoc principle in that behalf.  A plea of limitation\t has\nalso  been  indicated  by  the appellant  and  it  has\tbeen\nsuggested  that\t the  first contract having  merged  in\t the\nsecond\tit  is\tonly  under the\t latter\t contract  that\t the\nrespondent may have a cause of action.\t&quot;Thus the effect  of\nthe  two  contracts  considered\t together  may\thave  to  be\nadjudged in dealing with the question of limitation.  It has\nalso  been  suggested  that  the  respondent  knew  how\t the\naccounts were kept from year to year and in substance he may\nbe deemed to have agreed with the method adopted in  keeping\nthe  accounts.\tIf this point is raised by the appellant  it\nmay involve the decision of the question about the effect of\nthe  respondent&#x27;s conduct on his present claim.\t The  appel-\nlant  has also suggested that the respondent has adopted  an\nattitude  of blackmailing the appellant and  the  respondent\ntreats that as an aspersion on his character.  The relations\nbetween\t the parties have been very much embittered and\t the\nrespondent  apprehends that the appellant, being a  powerful\ncompany, may delay and seek to defeat the respondent&#x27;s claim\nby  protracting the proceedings before the arbitrators.\t  It\nnow looks impossible that the parties would agree to appoint\none  arbitrator,  and  so  if the  matter  goes\t before\t the\ndomestic  tribunal the two arbitrators appointed by the\t two\nparties\t respectively  may have to nominate a third  one  to\ncomplete the constitution of the domestic tribunal, and that\nit  is\tsaid may easily lead to a deadlock.   In  the  trial\ncourt attempts were made to settle this unfortunate  dispute\nbut  they failed and the respondent&#x27;s grievance is that\t the\nappellant adopted an unhelpful and noncooperative  attitude.\nIt  appears fairly clear that when the parties entered\tinto\nthe  present  contract and agreed that\tdifferences  between\nthem in regard to the interpretation and application of\t the\ncontract should be referred to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">727</span>\narbitration they did not anticipate the complications  which\nhave  subsequently  arisen.   That  is\twhy  an\t arbitration\nagreement  may\thave  been introduced  in  the\tcontract  in\nquestion.  All these facts have been considered by both\t the\ncourts,\t and  though it is true that in their  approach\t and\nfinal  decisions  in respect of these facts the\t two  courts\nhave  differed\tin material particulars, they  have  in\t the\nresult agreed with the conclusion that the discretion vested\nin them should be exercised in not granting stay as  claimed\nby the appellant.  Under these circumstances we do not think\nwe  would  be justified in substituting our  discretion\t for\nthat of the courts below.  It may be that if we were  trying\nthe  appellant&#x27;s application under<a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_17\"> s. 34</a> we might have\tcome\nto  a  different  conclusion;  and also\t that  we  may\thave\nhesitated to confirm the order of the trial court if we\t had\nbeen dealing with the matter as a court of first appeal; but\nthe matter has now come to us under <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_18\">Art. 136</a>, and so we\t can\njustly\tinterfere  with\t the  concurrent  exercise  of\t the\ndiscretion by the courts below only if we feel that the said\nexercise   of\tdiscretion  is\t patently   and\t  manifestly\nunreasonable, capricious or perverse and that it may  defeat\nthe ends of justice.  Having regard to all the circumstances\nand  facts of this case we are not disposed to hold  that  a\ncase  for  our\tinterference  has  been\t made  out  by\t the\nappellant.   That is why we dismiss this appeal but make  no\norder as to costs throughout.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_16\">\t\t\t\t  Appeal dismissed.\n</p>\n\n\n","numcites":5,"numcitedby":319,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":1652410,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"stay on proceedings","formInput":"stay%20on%20proceedings"},{"value":"art. 136","formInput":"art.%20136"},{"value":"relevency of facts ","formInput":"relevency%20of%20facts%20"},{"value":"judicial discretion ","formInput":"judicial%20discretion%20"},{"value":"stay of suit","formInput":"stay%20of%20suit"},{"value":"gajendragadkar","formInput":"gajendragadkar"},{"value":"discretion of court","formInput":"discretion%20of%20court"},{"value":"court stay to its own proceedings ","formInput":"court%20stay%20to%20its%20own%20proceedings%20"},{"value":"arbitration act 1940","formInput":"arbitration%20act%201940"},{"value":"exercise of discretion","formInput":"exercise%20of%20discretion"},{"value":"arbitration clause","formInput":"arbitration%20clause"},{"value":"arbitration agreement","formInput":"arbitration%20agreement"},{"value":"journalist","formInput":"journalist"},{"value":"arbitration act","formInput":"arbitration%20act"},{"value":"Reference arbitration ","formInput":"Reference%20arbitration%20"},{"value":"\"arbitration agreement\"","formInput":"%22arbitration%20agreement%22"},{"value":"parties to agreement","formInput":"parties%20to%20agreement"},{"value":"\"arbitration clause\"","formInput":"%22arbitration%20clause%22"},{"value":"after thought","formInput":"after%20thought"},{"value":"judicially","formInput":"judicially"}],"cats":[{"value":"legal-stay","formInput":"tag:legal-stay"},{"value":"special-leave-appeal-by-supreme-court","formInput":"tag:special-leave-appeal-by-supreme-court"},{"value":"arbitration","formInput":"tag:arbitration"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
