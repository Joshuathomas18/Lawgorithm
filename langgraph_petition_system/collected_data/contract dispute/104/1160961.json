The said issue was determined by \nthe Labour Court pursuant to or in furtherance of the order of the High Court \npassed in Writ Petition No.26874 of 1995.  While determining the said \nquestion, the Labour Court framed seven issues by an order dated \n31.12.1998, some of which are :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\t&quot;(i)\tWhether the 1st party proves that they were \nemployed by the 2nd party  Management in the job of \npermanent and perennial in nature.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">\t(ii)\tWhether the 2nd party Management proves \nthat the 1st party workmen were employed under different \ncontractors in the job of permanent and perennial in \nnature in various departments of the Management.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">\t(iii)\tWhether the 2nd party proves that system of \ncontract labour in respect of the nature of the workers \ninvolved in this Reference was not abolished in the 2nd \nparty Industry and that this Reference is not sustainable.&quot;\n</blockquote>\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">\tThe Labour Court opined :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">&quot;\u0005The plain reading of the first point in dispute to be \ndecided by this Court  is that &quot;are the contract workers \nemployed in the nature of contract work, justified in \ndemanding absorption as regular permanent employees \nof the management VISL, Bhadravathi (hereinafter called \nthe Management).  Therefore the point in dispute pre-\nsupposes that the 1 party Union Employees are the \ncontract workers employed in the nature of contract work \nunder certain contractors and whether such contract \nworkers are to be absorbed by the Management.  The fact \nthat the Union Employees who seek their absorption by \nthe Management are the contract workers is further very \nmuch evident from the averments made in the claim \nstatement preferred on behalf of the 1 party Union.  Para \n1 of the claim statement reads that they are representing \nthe contract labourers of the Management against whom \nthe present reference is made by the Government\u0005&quot;\n</blockquote>\t\t\t\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">The learned Presiding Officer of the Labour Court observed that in the \nlight of the judgment of the High Court between the parties, the moot \nquestion that arose for consideration was as to whether the court could \ndecide the validity of the reference as it stood, holding :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">&quot;\u0005It was contended that the dispute under reference \nsince pertained to the abolition of contract labour which \ncontract labour was not abolished by the appropriate \nGovernment under Sec.10 of the Contract Labour Act by \nway of Notification as contemplated under the said \nprovision the reference is bad in law inoperative and \nillegal.  I find substance in his arguments.  Undisputedly, \nthere is no abolition of <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_16\">Contract Act</a> under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_17\">Sec. 10</a> of the \nsaid Act by the appropriate Government in this case.  It \nwas well argued that the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_18\">Industrial Disputes Act</a> where \nunder the present reference is made is a general \nenactment and therefore, a special central enactment \nnamely, the Contract Labour Act shall prevail to the \nextent that it applies over the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_19\">I.D. Act</a>\u0005&quot;\n</blockquote>   \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">It was further held :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_17\">&quot;\u0005This Court certainly has got no jurisdiction to pass \nAward in favour of the employees holding them to be the \nemployees of principal employer namely the \nmanagement.  The question under reference, raised \nbefore this Court, certainly, relates to the abolition of \ncontract labour and that question cannot be decided by \nthis Court but by the competent appropriate Government \nunder the provisions of Sec. 10 of the Contract Labour \nAct\u0005&quot;  \n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">The Labour Court also took into consideration the contention raised \nby the representatives of the Union that the issue as to whether the  members \nof the Unions were really the employees of the management and not those of \nthe employees of the contractors was to be tried and decided by the said \ncourt as both the parties had led their oral and documentary evidences  in \nthat behalf.  Having regard to the nature of reference by the Appropriate \nGovernment, which fell for consideration before the Labour Court,  it \ndeclined to go into the said question, opining that it was not within its \nprovince to go into the question as to who the actual employer was as the \nsame did not fall in the category of matters, which can be said to be  \nincidental  to the main dispute.  It was opined :\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_18\">&quot;\u0005Therefore, it is clear that the I party Union itself  \napprehended that the reference made to this Court was \nnot in accordance with the law.  The principle <a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_20\">laid down \nby</a> his lordship of our Hon&#x27;ble High Court in the case \nreported in ILR 1994 Karnataka page 2603, taken support \nof by Learned Representative for the I Party Union \ncontending that jurisdiction point cannot be raised by the \nmanagement at this belated stage, in my opinion again \nhad no much substance the management in this case has \nchallenged the jurisdiction of this court at earliest point \nof time at para 2 of its counter statement.  Therefore, it \ncannot be said that the jurisdiction point was raised by \nthe  management at a belated state.  Therefore, as \ncontended for the management and as observed by his \nlordship of our Hon&#x27;ble High Court in the above said \nunreported judgment, the proper course and remedy \navailable for the I party Union was not by way of \nreference on hand at least with the present terms, but by \nway of approaching the Hon&#x27;ble High Court invoking its \nwrit jurisdiction seeking directions to the Central \nGovernment to take a decision under Section 10 of the \nContract Labour Act, as was already done in respect of \nthe 23 employees at Sl. No.26 Annexure to reference on \nhand.  Therefore, for the reasons foregoing I am \nconstrained to hold that reference is not valid and proper \nand that this court has no jurisdiction to adjudicate upon \nthe same.  Accordingly Issue No. 6 is answered in the \naffirmative and following order is passed.&quot;\n</blockquote>       \n\t\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">Before adverting to the questions raised before us, we may at this \njuncture notice the contention of Mr. V.N. Raghupathy that whereas in the \nreference only 26 workmen were made parties, more than  600 workmen \nwere made parties in the writ petition and, thus, only because before the \nappropriate Government a demand was raised by some of the workmen \ncontending that they were workmen of the contractors, an  industrial dispute \ncould be raised that the contract was a sham one and  in truth and substance  \nthe workmen were employed by the management.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">Writ Petitioner No.1 was Visveswaraya Iron &amp; Steel Limited Contract \nEmployees&#x27; Union.  615 workmen were parties thereto.

An industrial dispute \nwas also raised,  as noticed hereinbefore, by Visveswaraya Iron &amp; Steel Ltd. \nWorkers Association and Visveswaraya Iron &amp; Steel Limited Contract \nEmployees Union.  The Contract Employees&#x27; Union was common both in \nthe proceedings under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_21\">Industrial Disputes Act</a> also in the writ petition.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\">The 1970 Act is a complete code by itself.  It not only provides for \nregulation of contract labour but also abolition thereof.  Relationship of \nemployer and employee is essentially a question of fact.

Manohar Singh \n&amp; Another etc.  [2006 (7) SCALE  517], held :</span>                \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">&quot;Let us now take up the last ground on which the \napplication for amendment of the written statement was \nrejected by the High Court as well as the Trial Court. The \nrejection was made on the ground that inconsistent plea \ncannot be allowed to be taken. We are unable to \nappreciate the ground of rejection made by the High \nCourt as well as the Trial Court. After going through the \npleadings and also the statements made in the application \nfor amendment of the written statement, we fail to \nunderstand how inconsistent plea could be said to have \nbeen taken by the appellants in their application for \namendment of the written statement, excepting the plea \ntaken by the appellants in the application for amendment \nof written statement regarding the joint ownership of the \nsuit property. Accordingly, on facts, we are not satisfied \nthat the application for amendment of the written \nstatement could be rejected also on this ground. That \napart, it is now well settled that an amendment of a plaint \nand amendment of a written statement are not necessarily \ngoverned by exactly the same principle. It is true that \nsome general principles are certainly common to both, \nbut the rules that the plaintiff cannot be allowed to amend \nhis pleadings so as to alter materially or substitute his \ncause of action or the nature of his claim has necessarily \nno counterpart in the law relating to amendment of the \nwritten statement. Adding a new ground of defence or \nsubstituting or altering a defence does not raise the same \nproblem as adding, altering or substituting a new cause of \naction. Accordingly, in the case of amendment of written \nstatement, the courts are inclined to be more liberal in \nallowing amendment of the written statement than of \nplaint and question of prejudice is less likely to operate \nwith same rigour in the former than in the latter case.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1763071\" id=\"span_16\">While laying down the principle, this Court followed <a href=\"/doc/1763071/\" id=\"a_42\">Modi Spinning \n&amp; Weaving Mills Co.</a>  (supra) and distinguished Hira Lal (supra).</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">It is, thus, evident that by taking recourse to an amendment made in \nthe pleading, the party cannot be permitted to go beyond his admission.  The \nprinciple would be applied in an industrial adjudication having regard to the \nnature of the reference made by the Appropriate Government as also in view \nof the fact that an industrial adjudicator derives his jurisdiction from the \nreference only.\n</p>  \n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">There is another aspect of the matter which should also not be lost \nsight of.  For the purpose of exercising  jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 10</a> of the \n1970 Act, the appropriate Government is required to apply its mind.  Its \norder may be an administrative one but the same would  not be beyond the \npale of judicial review.  It must, therefore, apply its mind before making a \nreference on the basis of the materials placed before it by the workmen \nand/or management, as the case may be,  While doing so, it may be \ninappropriate for the same authority  on the basis of the materials that a \nnotification under <a href=\"/doc/1869167/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 10(1)(d)</a> of the 1947 Act  be issued, although it \nstands judicially determined that the workmen were employed by the \ncontractor. The State exercises  administrative power both in relation to  \nabolition of contract labour in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 10</a> of the 1970 Act as also  in \nrelation to making a reference for industrial adjudication to a Labour Court \nor a Tribunal under <a href=\"/doc/1869167/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 10(1)(d)</a> of the 1947 Act.  While issuing a \nnotification under the 1970 Act, the State  would have to proceed on the \nbasis that the principal employer had appointed contractors and such \nappointments are valid in law,  but while referring a dispute for industrial \nadjudication, validity of appointment of the contractor would itself be an \nissue as the State must prima facie satisfy itself that there exists a dispute as \nto whether the workmen are in fact not employed by the contractor but by \nthe management.  We are, therefore, with respect, unable to agree with the \nopinion of the High Court.      \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_33\">We would, however, hasten to add that this judgment shall not come \nin the way of the appropriate Government to apply its mind for the purpose \nof issuance of a notification under <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 10</a> of the 1970 Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">For the reasons aforementioned, the impugned judgment cannot be \nsustained, which is set aside accordingly.  The appeal is allowed.  In the \nfacts and circumstances of this case, however, there shall be no order as to \ncosts.  \n</p>","numcites":24,"numcitedby":152,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":1160961,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"amendment of written statement","formInput":"amendment%20of%20written%20statement"},{"value":"employees on contract","formInput":"employees%20on%20contract"},{"value":"contract labour","formInput":"contract%20labour"},{"value":"contract labour act","formInput":"contract%20labour%20act"},{"value":"''inconsistent pleas''","formInput":"%27%27inconsistent%20pleas%27%27"},{"value":"principal employer ","formInput":"principal%20employer%20"},{"value":"works contract","formInput":"works%20contract"},{"value":"abolition of contract labours","formInput":"abolition%20of%20contract%20labours"},{"value":"absorption","formInput":"absorption"},{"value":"contract act","formInput":"contract%20act"},{"value":"\"s b sinha\"","formInput":"%22s%20b%20sinha%22"},{"value":"trade union ","formInput":"trade%20union%20"},{"value":"steel authority of india","formInput":"steel%20authority%20of%20india"},{"value":"contract workers","formInput":"contract%20workers"},{"value":"mutual","formInput":"mutual"},{"value":"steel authority of india ltd","formInput":"steel%20authority%20of%20india%20ltd"},{"value":"CLRA","formInput":"CLRA"},{"value":"steel authority is other authority","formInput":"steel%20authority%20is%20other%20authority"},{"value":"labour acts","formInput":"labour%20acts"},{"value":"industrial dispute","formInput":"industrial%20dispute"}],"cats":[{"value":"dispute-resolution-references","formInput":"tag:dispute-resolution-references"},{"value":"industrial","formInput":"tag:industrial"},{"value":"prohibition-of-employment-of-contract-labour","formInput":"tag:prohibition-of-employment-of-contract-labour"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
