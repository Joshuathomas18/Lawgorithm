Thus, the arbitral\n                                award has dealt with matters beyond the scope of submission, and\n                                accordingly, deserves to be set-aside.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">                          11.

Ms. Kaul also argues that notwithstanding the above, given that the\n                                    relief granted was in respect of other contracts, which were separate\n                                    and distinct agreements, separate arbitral tribunals ought to have been\n                                    constituted for each such contract. The submission is that since the\n                                    jurisdiction of an arbitral tribunal is limited, it must be restricted to\n                                    the dispute referred to it; and a contravention thereof would not be an\n                                    error within the tribunal‟s jurisdiction but outside its jurisdiction,\n                                    making the award amenable to interference under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_7\">section 34</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">                          13.

Finally therefore, against a claim of Rs. 92,101.25 arising from the\n                                subject work contract, the learned Arbitrator has proceeded to award\n                                Rs.20 lacs which admittedly arises from the other 44 contracts, which\n                                contracts were never subject matter of the arbitral proceedings.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">                          22.   It requires to be emphasised that the entire awarded sum of Rs.20 lacs\n                                arose entirely from the other 44 contracts and had nothing to do with\n                                the subject work contract, that had been referred to arbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_54\">                          23.   To be clear, since the petitioner had engaged the respondent to\n                                perform certain works of the same type in different locations, for\n                                which separate and distinct contracts/work orders were issued, though\n                                the parties could have referred their inter-se disputes arising from the\n                                other contracts, if any, to the same person who had been appointed as\n                                arbitrator pursuant to referral order dated 02.06.2010; and the same\n                                arbitrator could have decided the disputes as separate references; but\n                                that was never done.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_55\">                          24.   What falls foul of <a href=\"/doc/148869/\" id=\"a_23\">section 34(2)(a)(iv)</a> however, is the fact that despite\n                                finding that the contracts were not inter-related, the learned Arbitrator\n                                intertwined the disputes arising from the other contracts and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_102\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_103\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_104\">By:NEERAJ</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_105\">Signing Date:01.02.2023   O.M.P. 398/2012                                                        Page 18 of 19</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">11:36:04</span>\n                                                        2023/DHC/000678\n\n\n\n\n                                proceeded to decide the same as part of the specific reference made to\n                                him by referral order dated 02.06.2010. This is impermissible in law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">                          25.   Therefore, it requires not much discussion to hold that the arbitral\n                                award to the extent that it awards to the respondent Rs. 20 lacs is\n                                clearly in the teeth of <a href=\"/doc/148869/\" id=\"a_24\">section 34(2)(a)(iv)</a> of the A&amp;C Act and\n                                deserves to be set-aside on that ground alone.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_57\">                          26.   Accordingly, the court is persuaded to accept the present petition; and\n                                since, as discussed above, the decision on matters submitted to\n                                arbitration is separable from those not so submitted, arbitral award\n                                dated 30.11.2011 is partly set-aside to the extent that the petitioner\n                                was directed to make payments amounting to about Rs.20 lacs arising\n                                from the other contracts; while upholding the arbitral award to the\n                                extent that it finds that no payment is due towards the subject work\n                                contract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_58\">                          27.
