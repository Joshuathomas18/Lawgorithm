The case of the petitioner is that the respondent M.P. State Mining\n                           Corporation invited tenders for the purpose of sand mining for the\n                           quarry situated in district Katni and E-tender notice in this regard was\n                           published on 08.10.2019. The tender was issued for total 49 sand\n                           quarries having available quantity of 14,00,000 cubic meter and offset\n                           price was determined at Rs.17,50,00,000/- by the respondent No.6/State\n                           Mining Corporation at the rate of Rs.125 per cub.m. This offset price\n                           was the minimum royalty that was payable and tender was invited to\n                           offer such highest amount. The quantity of sand was also specified in\n                           cubic meter for each of such 49 quarries. The petitioner was declared\n                           successful bidder for amount of Rs.56,17,50,000/- per year for quantity\n                           of 14,00,000 cubic meter of sand at the rate of Rs.401 per cub.m. as\n                           highest offered royalty, which could be excavated by the petitioner from\n                           49 quarries notified by respondent- State Mining Corporation. After\n                           being declared as successful, the petitioner was required to pay\n                           Rs.56,17,50,000/-per year as instalment of highest royalty offered for\n                           sand and advance security deposit of Rs.14,04,37,500/-. The petitioner\n                           deposited the amount as directed by the Corporation. Thus, a letter of\n                           intent dated 21.01.2020 (Annexure P/5) and agreement dated 08.03.2020\n                           (Annexure P/6) were executed. The period of lease was extended to\n                           30.06.2023 due to Covid pandemic. Thus the petitioner started\n                           excavating sand from quarries and started paying the royalty each month\n                           in instalment as per terms upto 12.10.2022.

The entire case of the respondents is that\n                           because of the judgment of the Division Bench dated 03.08.2021 passed\n                           in W.P.No.8613/2020 of the Gwalior Bench, an amendment was carried\n                           out in Rule 27 of the Rules of 2019 and only after this amendment, the\n                           Madhya Pradesh Minor Mineral Rules, 1996 (hereinafter to be referred\n                           to as &quot;the Rules of 1996&quot;) were made applicable to the Rules of 2019\n                           i.e. on and from 14.07.2021 and prior to this amendment as stated in the\n                           reply dated 22.11.2023 filed by the respondents vide para 15 and 22, no\n                           royalty was being charged from the petitioners. The decision dated\n                           03.08.2021 of the Gwalior Bench is not applicable to the present case as\n                           the said judgment is not on the question of royalty but on the issue of\n                           confiscation of vehicles involved in illegal transportation.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">                           8.    It is further contended by the petitioners that the royalty provision\n                           is part of <a href=\"/doc/1173330/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 15(3)</a> of the Mines and Minerals (Development and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">Signed by: CHRISTOPHER</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">PHILIP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">Signing time: 12-12-2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">12:34:33</span>\n                                                                ..8..\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_15\">                           NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:60084\n\n                           Regulation) Act, 1957 read with Rule 29 of the Madhya Pradesh Minor\n                           Mineral Rules, 1996 and same were made applicable to the Rules of\n                           2019 from the very inception because there is no specific provision for\n                           charging royalty in the Rules of 2019 and as such there was no\n                           transgression of Rules of 1996 in the Rules of 2019 from the very\n                           beginning and there was no eclipse of the provisions. It is further\n                           submitted that royalty by way of E-TP (Electronic Transit Pass) was\n                           being charged along with the contract amount by the respondents from\n                           the day one.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">                           9.    The learned counsel for petitioners further submits that in the\n                           reply of the State Government, there is no counter to the fact that the\n                           petitioners have paid royalty as stated in para 5.8 and ground raised in\n                           para 6.5 of W.P.No.25725/2022 and others, where documentary\n                           evidence of payment of royalty has been brought on record i.e. E-TP by\n                           the petitioners which clearly stipulates that royalty has been charged by\n                           the State Government on the mineral sand. The contention of the\n                           petitioners was that E-TP is issued by the Department of Mineral\n                           Resources, Government of Madhya Pradesh and the portal through\n                           which the E-TP are issued is owned, controlled and operated by the\n                           respondent No.1 which clearly leaves no scope and iota of doubt of the\n                           fact that the royalty has not been charged by the respondents even before\n                           the amendment of Rule 27 of Rules of 2019.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">                           10.   It is further argued by the petitioners that as per document No.2\n                           (at page 12 of the written submission) that in the Letter of Acceptance\n                           dated 27.02.2020 in clause 8 of Note of the details of Mines and\n                           Amount in the E-Auction, it is clearly mentioned that the contractual\n                           amount includes royalty and there is no denial of the same in the reply\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">Signed by: CHRISTOPHER</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">PHILIP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">Signing time: 12-12-2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">12:34:33</span>\n                                                                ..9..\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">                           NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:60084\n\n                           filed by the respondents which again solidifies the stand that royalty has\n                           been paid and as such the impugned order deserves to be set aside on\n                           this ground alone.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">                           11.   Further contention of the petitioners is that the amendment in the\n                           Rule 27 carried out vide notification dated 13.07.2021 has no relevance,\n                           as the same does not deal with royalty provisions more so it was only a\n                           typographical error which has been rectified and the respondents have\n                           misinterpreted the aforesaid rule and for this very reason, the rule is not\n                           required to be challenged and it is just to mislead the Court. It is\n                           pertinent to mention here that the GST department has acknowledged\n                           that royalty has been paid and on which they have imposed the tax and\n                           the other department i.e. Mining Department even though have charged\n                           royalty are taking a stand that no royalty has been paid, which cannot be\n                           sustained. The same is fortified by the notice issued to the petitioner in\n                           W.P.No.25725/2022 which clearly shows that the GST department has\n                           specifically acknowledged imposition of 18% tax on deposited royalty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_20\">                           12.   Learned counsel for the petitioners ultimately submit that the\n                           petitioners have paid royalty to the State Government and on this very\n                           reasons, the impugned order dated 13.10.2022 deserves to be set aside\n                           and the security deposit being illegally and arbitrarily withheld by the\n                           respondents may be directed to be released.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_21\">                           13    Per contra, the stand of the respondents is that the Rules of 2019\n                           particularly Rule 10 only deals with the determination of the contract\n                           price for grant of license/lease to excavate and exploit the mineral sand\n                           in a particular district. The same does not deal with imposition of\n                           royalty.

Shri Prashant Singh, learned Advocate General appearing on\n                           behalf of the respondents submitted that a reading of clauses 6, 7 and 8\n                           of the statutory contract agreement reveals that the contract amount and\n                           other dues of the State Government are distinct and separate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_24\">                           15.   Learned Advocate General inviting attention of this Court to\n                           amendment of Rule 27 of the Rules of 2019, submits that Rules of 2019\n                           do not deal with the royalty and therefore, to that extent, the Rules of\n                           1996 are applicable on the mineral sand. Since the amendment is by\n                           substitution and clarificatory, the same would have retrospective\n                           applicability.   He further contends that the petitioners have not\n                           challenged the amendment made in Rules 27 of the Rules of 2019 vide\n                           Gazette Notification dated 14.07.2021 in the instant petitions and in the\n                           absence of challenge to the validity of the said rules, the same remains\n                           binding and enforceable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_25\">                           16.   It is further contended that the impugned demand notice is by\n                           virtue of amendment in the statutory rules and therefore, the question of\n                           grant of opportunity of hearing does not arise and no prejudice has been\n                           caused to the petitioners by non-grant of opportunity of hearing prior to\n                           passing of the impugned demand notice.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">Signed by: CHRISTOPHER</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">PHILIP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">Signing time: 12-12-2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">12:34:33</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_26\">                                                                ..11..\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">                           NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:60084\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_28\">                           17.

Therefore, we do not think that it is a universal\n                                 rule that the word &quot;substitution&quot; necessarily or always connotes\n                                 two severable steps, that is to say, one of repeal and another of a\n                                 fresh enactment even if it implies two steps.

On considering the aforesaid judgment, in the instant case, bare\n                           reading of amended rule 27 of the Sand Rules of 2019 makes it clear that\n                           the amendment is not clarificatory in nature. Though the amendment is\n                           by way of substitution, that cannot be applicable retrospectively unless\n                           and until there is clear and expressed intention shown by the legislation.\n                           However, there is no word to suggest that the legislative intent was to\n                           give retrospective application.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">                           39.   The language used in a rule and law should be interpreted strictly\n                           on the sense on which it was intended until and unless there appears\n                           contrary intention. It is well settled principle of interpretation of statute\n                           that a statute has to be construed without adding any word to it or\n                           subtracting any word from it and an interpretation which makes a part of\n                           the statute redundant has to be avoided. For the aforesaid reasons, we\n                           are of the considered view that the amendment in Sand Rules of 2019\n                           which came into force on 14.07.2021 has no retrospective application.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_90\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_91\">Signed by: CHRISTOPHER</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">PHILIP</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">Signing time: 12-12-2024</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_94\">12:34:33</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">                                                                 ..20..\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">                           NEUTRAL CITATION NO. 2024:MPHC-JBP:60084\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_60\">                           40.

Of the various rules guiding how a legislation has to\n                                     be interpreted, one established rule is that unless a\n                                     contrary intention appears, a legislation is presumed not to\n                                     be intended to have a retrospective operation. The idea\n                                     behind the rule is that a current law should govern current\n                                     activities. Law passed today cannot apply to the events of\n                                     the past. If we do something today, we do it keeping in view\n                                     the law of today and in force and not\n                                     tomorrow&#x27;s backward adjustment of it. Our belief in the\n                                     nature of the law is founded on the bed rock that every\n                                     human being is entitled to arrange his affairs by relying on\n                                     the existing law and should not find that his plans\n                                     have been retrospectively upset. This principle of law is\n                                     known as lex prospicit non respicit : law looks forward not\n                                     backward. As was observed in Phillips vs. Eyre, a\n                                     retrospective legislation is contrary to the general\n                                     principle that legislation by which the conduct of mankind\n                                     is to be regulated when introduced for the first time to deal\n                                     with future acts ought not to change the character of past\n                                     transactions carried on upon the faith of the then existing\n                                     law.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">                                     32.

Another equally important principle applies: in the absence of\n                                 express statutory authorization, delegated legislation in the form of\n                                 rules or regulations, cannot operate retrospectively. In Union of\n                                 India v M.C. Ponnose 1970 SCR (1) 678, this rule was spelt out in\n                                 the following terms:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">                                     &quot;The courts will not, therefore, ascribe retrospectivity to\n                                     new laws affecting rights unless by express words or\n                                     necessary implication it appears that such was the\n                                     intention of the legislature. The Parliament can delegate its\n                                     legislative power within the recognised limits. Where any\n                                     rule or regulation is made by any person or authority to\n                                     whom such powers have been delegated by the legislature\n                                     it may or may not be possible to make the same so as to\n                                     give retrospective operation. It will depend on the\n                                     language employed in the statutory provision which may in\n                                     express terms or by necessary implication empower the\n                                     authority concerned to make a rule or regulation with\n                                     retrospective effect.
