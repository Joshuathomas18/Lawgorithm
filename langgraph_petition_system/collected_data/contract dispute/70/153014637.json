It\n                 precluded the Civil Court from examining whether the dispute was truly covered\n                 by the arbitration agreement. It was, therefore, contended that the MOM only\n                 recorded the manner in which the contracts would be foreclosed in the future, as\n                 evidenced by the communications exchanged between the parties, including the\n                 one dated 25th October 2008.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">                 25.      Prayer &#x27;D&#x27; of the suit which sought a direction to pay 5% of the value of\n                 the dispatched material on account of late delivery was also something which did\n                 not arise under the MOM and was related to the contracts.

The intention of parties in discharging a contract by &quot;accord and\n                 satisfaction&quot; is to relieve each other of existing or new obligations under the\n                 contract but not relieve each other of their obligation to settle any dispute\n                 pertaining to the original contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">                 Analysis\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">                 28.

Sixthly, no arbitration clause or agreement was mentioned in the MOM,\n                          nor there was any reference to any term or provision of the original\n                          contracts;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">                 vii.     Seventhly, the fact that the MOM was dated 25th June 2018 and the suit\n                          was filed in April 2022, and there was no communication by the\n                          defendant, in the intervening period, that the arbitration clause would\n                          apply or the original contracts would subsist. Moreover, the application\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_204\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_205\">                 I.A. 36412/2024 in CS(COMM) 628/2022                               Page 31 of 33</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_206\">Digitally Signed</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_207\">By:MANISH KUMAR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_208\">Signing Date:09.04.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_209\">18:49:55</span>\n                           under <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_54\">section 45</a> of the A&amp;C Act was moved more than two years later,\n                          while the suit was pending, and the delay seems to suggest that this has\n                          been an afterthought, though not a determinative factor for the Court to\n                          reach this opinion; and\n                viii.     Lastly, reliance by defendant no.1 on SBI General Insurance (supra)\n                          is not apposite and relevant, considering that the issue in this case was\n                          related to an insurance claim, and the dispute was related to whether the\n                          contract had been discharged or not. The Supreme Court, on the basis\n                          that the issue was a mixed question of fact and law, and therefore\n                          arbitrable, had arrived at the finding that the original contract would\n                          subsist. These facts are completely distinguishable from the case at\n                          hand, considering that there is no leftover dispute relating to the short\n                          closure of the contract, since the defendant has consistently\n                          acknowledged the same in subsequent communications, as noted\n                          above. There is no mixed question of fact and law which needs to be\n                          determined, for which provisions of the original contract need to be\n                          adverted to.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">                 Conclusion\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">                 <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"38761181\" id=\"span_210\">39.      In the opinion of the Court, permitting a commercial party to spin a web\n                 around and obfuscate what seems to be a clear and categorical admission of\n                 liability and agreement to the modality of payment, would be diluting and\n                 eroding the sanctity of contracts. There would be no purpose served to refer\n                 the matter back to arbitration, where no dispute arises.
