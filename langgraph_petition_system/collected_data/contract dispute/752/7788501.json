It\n                      was further argued that an arbitrator must include the\n                      basis on which, it has arrived at the conclusion on the set\n                      of facts, inasmuch as, <a href=\"/doc/1769118/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 31</a> of the Act&#x27; 1996\n                      mandates that every award should give reasons in\n                      support thereof and reasons are the links between the\n                      facts and the conclusion. The mere conclusion on the\n                      basis of arbitrator&#x27;s subjective opinion without indicating\n                      the objective links between the facts and the opinion,\n                      would not suffice for the reasons that are mandated by\n                      the statute to be furnished. The mandate under <a href=\"/doc/193987/\" id=\"a_8\">Section\n                      31 (3)</a> of the Act&#x27; 1996 is to have reasoning, which is\n                      intelligible and adequate and, which can, in appropriate\n                      cases, be even implied by the Courts for a fair reading of\n                      the award on the documents referred to thereunder, if\n                      the need be. Based on <a href=\"/doc/40565478/\" id=\"a_9\">the said decision</a>, it was contended\n                      that <a href=\"/doc/193987/\" id=\"a_10\">Section 31 (3)</a>, though does not require an elaborate\n                      judgment to be passed by the Arbitrator having regard to\n                      the speedy resolution of the dispute, but the requirement\n                      of a reasoned order which is proper, intelligible and\n                      adequate cannot be undermined. If the challenge to the\n                      award is passed on the ground that the same is\n                      unintelligible, the same would be equivalent to providing\n                      no reasons at all.</span>\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                                                Page 18 of 50</span>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">Uploaded by MR.
