To implement this  Convention\nParliament  enacted  the  <a href=\"/doc/142812771/\" id=\"a_3\">Foreign  Awards  (Recognition\t and\nEnforcement) Act</a> XLV of 1961 <a href=\"/doc/18760292/\" id=\"a_4\">Section 3</a> of the Act  provides,\ninter  alia,  that &quot;if any party to a  submission  made,  in\npursuance  of an agreement&quot; commences any legal\t proceedings\nin  any Court any other party to the submission may  at\t any\ntime after appearance and before filing a written  statement\nor  taking  any other step in the proceedings apply  to\t the\nCourt  to  stay\t the  proceedings  and\tthe  Court,   unless\nsatisfied  that the agreement is null and void,\t inoperative\nor incapable of being performed. shall make an order staying\nthe proceedings.\nIn respect of a contract entered into by the respondent,  an\nIndian\tFirm,  with  the  appellant,  a\t Russian  firm,\t the\nrespondent  instituted\ta  suit in  the\t Madras\t High  Court\nalleging  breach of contract.  Thereafter the  Russian\tfirm\ninstituted  proceedings in terms of the arbitral  clause  in\nthe contract before the Foreign Trade Arbitration Commission\nof  the\t U.S.S.R Chamber of Commerce, Moscow.\tThe  Russian\nfirm  also  entered appearance, under  protest,\t before\t the\nMadras High Court and on the same date filed an\t application\nunder <a href=\"/doc/18760292/\" id=\"a_5\">section 3</a> of the Act for stay of the suit.  The Indian\nfirm   filed  an  application  for  an\tinterim\t  injunction\nrestraining  the Russian firm from taking -any further\tpart\nin  the arbitration proceedings at Moscow.  The\t High  Court\ndismissed the application filed by the Russian firm for stay\nof the suit and granted the interim injunction sought by the\nIndian\tfirm.\tIn  appeal to this Court,  the\tIndian\tfirm\ncontended  that\t s. 3 of the: Act could be  invoked  by\t the\nRussian\t firm  only if it had  implemented  the\t arbitration\nagreement   by\t actually  submitting\tthe,   dispute\t for\narbitration  prior to the institution of the suit.   On\t the\nquestions  (i)\twhether\t the words  &quot;a\tsubmission  made  in\npursuance of an agreement&quot; ill <a href=\"/doc/18760292/\" id=\"a_6\">section 3</a> of the Act meant an\nactual\t or   completed\t reference  made  pursuant   to\t  an\narbitration agreement or they meant an arbitration agreement\nthat  has  come\t into existence as a  result  of  commercial\ncontract and (ii) whether the courts in India could grant an\ninjunction  restraining\t a party in Moscow  from  proceeding\nwith the conduct of arbitration before a tribunal there,\n54\nHELD : (Per Shah and Grover, JJ.)\nThe   word  &quot;submission&quot;  in  <a href=\"/doc/18760292/\" id=\"a_7\">section  3</a>  means\t an   actual\nsubmission made in pursuance of an arbitration agreement  or\narbitral  clause  to which the Convention  setforth  in\t the\n<a href=\"/doc/142812771/\" id=\"a_8\">Schedule to the Act</a> applies.  If submission means &quot;agreement\nto refer&quot; or an arbitral clause in a commercial contract  it\nmakes the entire set of words unintelligible and  completely\nambiguous.  It is difficult to comprehend in that case,\t why\nthe legislature should have used the words which follow\t the\nterm   &quot;submission&quot;,  namely  &quot;made  in\t pursuance   of\t  an\nagreement&quot;.   If  by  &quot;agreement&quot;  is  meant  a\t  commercial\ncontract  the words &quot;made in pursuance of&quot; convey no  sense.\nThe difficulties disappear if the word submission, is  given\nthe meaning of an actual submission of a particular  dispute\nto  the\t authority of an arbitrator.  There is no  rule.  of\ninterpretation\t by  which  rank  ambiguity  can  be   first\nintroduced  by\tgiving\tcertain\t expressions  a\t  particular\nmeaning\t and  then an attempt can be made to emerge  out  of\nsemantic  confusion  and obscurity by having resort  to\t the\npresumed  intention  of the legislature to  give  effect  to\ninternational obligations.  In this country, as is the\tcase\nin England, a treaty or international protocol or convention\ndoes  not become operative by its own force unless  domestic\nlegislation has been introduced to attain a specific result.\nOnce Parliament has legislated the court must first look  at\nthe  legislation and construe the language employed  in\t it.\nIf  statutory enactments are clear in meaning they  must  be\nconstrued  according.to their meaning even though  they\t are\ncontrary  to the comity of nations or international law.   A\nclear  deviation  from the rigid and strict  rule  that\t the\ncourts must stay a suit whenever an international commercial\narbitration,  as  contemplated\tby  the\t protocol  and\t the\nConventions, was to take place, is to be found in <a href=\"/doc/18760292/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 3</a>.\nIt  is\tof  a  nature which is\tcommon,\t to  all  provisions\nrelating to stay in English and Indian arbitration laws, the\nprovision  being that the application to the Court for\tstay\nof the suit must be made by a party before tiling a  written\nstatement  or taking any other step in the proceedings.\t  If\nthe  condition is not fulfilled no stay can be granted.\t [65\nG-66 H; 68 D]\nOwners\tof Cargo on Board the Merak v.

Wood &amp; Son\tLtd.\nv., Bengal Corporation, A.I.R. 1959 Cal. 8, referred to.\n(Per  Ramaswami, J. dissenting.) The expression\t &quot;submission\nmade  in pursuance of an agreement&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/18760292/\" id=\"a_10\">section 3</a> has  to  be\nconstrued in its historical setting.  The word\t&quot;submission&quot;\nmust be interpreted to mean tile arbitral clause itself\t and\nthe  word  &quot;agreement&quot;\tas the commercial  or  the  business\nagreement which includes or embodies that clause.  In  other\nwords  the  word &quot;submission&quot; in the opening  words  of\t the\nsection\t means an agreement to refer to arbitration and\t the\nwords &quot;the agreement to which the convention setforth in the\nschedule  applies&quot; means the business agreement or  contract\ncontaining  the arbitral clause.  It follows therefore\tthat\nif  there is an arbitral clause whether this is followed  by\nactual\treference to arbitration or not, the very  existence\nof this clause in the commercial agreement would render\t the\nstay  of  the suit mandatory under <a href=\"/doc/18760292/\" id=\"a_11\">section 3</a>. This  view  is\nconsidered  with  the rule of construction that\t as  far  as\npracticable municipal law must be interpreted by the  courts\nin  conformity with international obligations which the\t law\nmay  seek  to effectuate., It is well settled  that  if\t the\nlanguage  of  a section is ambiguous or is capable  of\tmore\nthan one meaning the protocol itself becomes relevant,\tfor,\nthere is a prima facie presumption that Parliament does\t not\nintend to act in breach of international law including\n\t\t\t     55\nspecific  treaty obligations.  <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_12\">Article, 2</a> of the  convention\nimposes\t a  duty on the court of a  contracting\t state\twhen\nseized\t of  such  an  action  to  refer  the\tparties\t  to\narbitration.  <a href=\"/doc/18760292/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 3</a> must therefore be read in consonance\nwith this international obligation.  The doctrine of literal\nintepretation is not always the best method for ascertaining\nthe   intention\t  of  Parliament.   The\t  better   rule\t  of\ninterpretation\tis that a statute should be so construed  as\nto prevent the mischief and advance the remedy according  to\nthe true intent of the makers of the statute.

The  point\t about\tthe.\nRussian\t firm  having  no representative in  India  was\t not\nagitated before the High Court and the position taken up  in\nthe  plaint  was  that\tthe-Russian  firm  was\tcarrying  on\nbusiness in the U.S.S.R. and at Madras.\t The principle;\t em-\nbodied\tin  s.\t35  the\t <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_14\">Arbitration  Act,  1940</a>  cannot  be\ncompletely   ignored  while  considering  the  question\t  of\ninjunction.  In the present case when the suit is not  being\nstayed\tunder <a href=\"/doc/18760292/\" id=\"a_15\">section 3</a> of the Act it would be\tcontrary  to\nthe  principle underlying s. 35 not to grant an,  injunction\nrestraining  the  Russian  firm\t from  proceeding  with\t the\nArbitration  at Moscow.\t The principle essentially  is\tthat\nthe arbitrator should not proceed with the arbitration\tside\nby  side in rivalry or in competition as if it were a  civil\ncourt. [69 H, 70 H]\n (Per  Ramaswami J dissenting.) Even assuming that 3 of\t the\nAct is not applicable this is not a proper case in which the\nHigh Court should have issued an injunction restraining\t the\nappellant  from proceeding with the arbitration.  As a\trule\nthe  Court  has\t to  exercise  its  discretion\twith   great\ncircumspection\tfor  it\t is imperative\tthat  the  right  of\naccess; to the tribunals of a country should not be  lightly\ninterfered with,.  It is not sufficient merely to show\tthat\ntwo  actions  have been started for it is  not\tprima  facie\nvexatious  to  commence two actions about the  same  subject\nmatter,\t one  here  and\t one  abroad.  The  reason  of\tthis\nreluctance  to exercise the jurisdiction is that owing to  a\npossible  difference between the laws of the two  countries,\nthe stay of one of the actions may deprive &#x27;the plaintiff of\nsome  advantage which he is justified in pursuing.  Thus  he\nmay have a personal remedy in one country and a remedy\tonly\nagainst\t the goods in another; or a remedy against  land  in\none  State  but\t no  such  remedy  in  another.,  The  rule,\ntherefore  is  that  a plea of lis alibi  pendens  will\t not\nsucceed\t and the court will not order a stay of\t proceedings\nunless\tthe defendant proves vexation in point of fact.\t  He\nmust show that the continued prosecution of both actions  is\noppressive  or embarrassing, an onus which he will :find  it\ndifficult to discharge if the\n56\nplaintiff  can\tindicate  some material\t advantage  that  is\nlikely\tto  result from each separate  action.\t Each  case,\ntherefore  depends  upon the setting of its  own  facts\t and\ncircumstances.

These connected appeals which involve points  of\nimportance   and   interest  in\t  international\t  commercial\narbitration  arise out of a suit instituted on the  original\nside  of  the  High Court of Judicature at  Madras  by\tM/s.\nTarapore &amp; Co. against.\t M/s.  V. O. Tractoroexport, Moscow.\nInitially   the\t claim\twas  for  a   permanent\t  injunction\nrestraining the Russian firm from realizing the proceeds  of\na  Letter of Credit opened on June 9, 1965 with the Bank  of\nIndia  Ltd.,  Madras,  which had also been  impleaded  as  a\ndefendant.   Subsequently by an amendment of the plaint\t the\nplaintiff has confined relief to recovery of damages.\nThe  facts chronologically are as follows : A  contract\t was\nentered into on February 2, 1965, between the Indian and the\nRussian firms for the supply of earth-moving machinery for a\nvalue of Rs. 66,09,372.00. The machinery was required by the\nIndian\tfirm  for  executing the work  of  excavation  of  a\nfeeder-\t canal as part of the Farakka Barrage  Project.\t  On\nJune 9, 1965. the Indian firm opened a Letter of Credit with\nthe  Bank  of  India  Ltd., for\t the  entire  value  of\t the\nmachinery  in favour of the Russian firm.  The\tconsignments\nstarted\t arriving at Calcutta in October 1965.\tOn  February\n22,  1966, the Indian firm wrote to the Russian firm  saying\nthat there was something wrong with the design and work-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">\t\t\t     57</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">ing of motorised scrapers which had been supplied and  which\nformed\tone  of\t the  items  of\t machinery  covered  by\t the\ncontract.   One\t June 6, 1966 came the\tdevaluation  of\t the\nIndian rupee by 57.48% as a result of -which the amount that\nbecame payable by the Indian firm to the Russian firm  under\nthe  contract increased by Rs. 25 lakhs or so.\tOn June\t 20,\n1966, the Russian firm demanded an increase in the Letter of\nCredit\towing  to the devaluation.  On August 1,  1966,\t the\nIndian\tfirm served a notice on the Russian firm  containing\nthe  main allegations relating to breech of contract on\t the\npart  of  the Russian firm.  The letter was called  upon  to\nremedy the breaches and pay compensation.  It was made clear\nthat  until  this  was done the Russian firm  would  not  be\nentitled  to  encash the Letter of Credit  for\tthe  balance\namount.\t On August 4, 1966, the Indian firm filed a suit  on\nthe  original side of the Madras High Court and obtained  an\nex parte order of injunction in respect of the operation  of\nthe  Letter  of\t Credit.  On August 14,\t 1966,\tthe  parties\narrived at a settlement at Delhi after mutual discussion.\nPursuant  to  the agreement the suit was  withdrawn  by\t the\nIndian\tfirm  but no amicable settlement,  as  contemplated,\ntook  place.  The Indian firm instituted a suit\t (No.\tC.S.\n118  of 1967) on the original side of the Madras High  Court\non  August  14, 1967.  It also filed an application  for  an\ninterim\t injunction  in the matter of the operation  of\t the\nLetter of Credit.  On October 26, 1967, another\t application\nwas  filed for an interim injunction against the  encashment\nof the devaluation drafts.  On November 4, 1967, the Russian\nfirm instituted proceedings in terms of the arbitral  clause\nin  the\t contract  before  the\tForeign\t Trade\t Arbitration\nCommission  of the U.S.S.R. Chamber of.\t Commerce,,  Moscow.\nOn  November 14, 1967, the Russian firm\t entered  appearance\nunder  protest\t_ before the Madras High Court in  the\tsuit\nfiled  by  the Indian firm.  On the same date  the,  Russian\nfirm  filed an application under<a href=\"/doc/18760292/\" id=\"a_16\"> s. 3</a> of the-<a href=\"/doc/142812771/\" id=\"a_17\">Foreign  Awards\n(Recognition  and Enforcement) Act</a> XLV of 1961,\t hereinafter\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">-called\t the Act.  A prayer was made for stay of  the  suit.\nOn  January 15, 1968, the Indian firm filed  an\t application\nfor an interim injunction restraining the Russian  firm-from\ntaking any further part in the arbit proceedings at  Moscow.\nWe are not concerned with the branch of the litigation which\ncame  up  to this Court at a prior stage in respect  of\t the\ninterim injunctions granted by the single judge with  regard\nto the operation of the Letter of Credit, and the subsequent\narrangement made for payment as a result of devaluation.  It\nis  sufficient to mention that the appeals brought  to\tthis\nCourt  were allowed on November 26, 1968, and the  temporary\ninjunction  granted by the learned single judge relating  to\nthe operation of the Letter of Credit was vacated.\nSup.  CI/70-5\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">58</span>\nThe application which had been filed by the Russian firm for\nstay  of  the suit under<a href=\"/doc/18760292/\" id=\"a_18\"> S. 3</a> of the Act  was  dismissed  by\nRamamurthi  J., on April 12, 1968.  The application  of\t the\nIndian\tfirm  for  an  interim\tinjunction  restraining\t the\nRussian firm from taking any further part in the arbitration\nproceedings  at Moscow was, however, granted.\tThe  Russian\nfirm  preferred\t appeals against the orders of\tthe  learned\nsingle judge before a division bench.  The bench  maintained\nthe  orders of Ramamurthi, J. The present appeals have\tbeen\nbrought\t by the Russian firm by special leave  both  against\nthe order of the division bench and against the judgment  of\nthe learned single judge.  This was presumably done  because\nthere was some controversy about -the finality of the orders\nwhich had been made by the single judge of the High Court.\nThe  questions which have to be determined in these  appeals\nare  quite narrow.  The first question is whether the  words\n&quot;a  submission\tmade in pursuance of an agreement&quot;  mean  an\nactual\t or   completed\t reference  made  pursuant   to\t  an\narbitration agreement or they mean an arbitration  agreement\nthat  has  come into existence as a result of  a  commercial\ncontract.  According to the appellant firm whenever there is\nan  arbitration\t agreement  or\tan  arbitral  clause  in   a\ncommercial   contract  of  the\tnature\tmentioned   in\t the\nConvention the court is bound to stay the suit provided\t the\nother  conditions laid down in<a href=\"/doc/18760292/\" id=\"a_19\"> s. 3</a> are satisfied.  On\tthis\napproach  the  word &quot;submission&quot; is to be understood  as  an\narbitration   agreement\t or  arbitral  clause  relating\t  to\nexisting  or  future differences and  the  word\t &quot;agreement&quot;\nmeans an agreement of a commercial or business character  to\nwhich the Convention applies.  The respondent firm maintains\nthat the critical words submission?&#x27; and &quot;agreement&quot; must be\ngiven  their  natural and grammatical meaning and  the\tword\n&quot;submission&quot; made in pursuance of an agreement can only mean\nan  actual  submission\tof  the\t disputes  to  the  arbitral\ntribunal.   The word &quot;agreement&quot; can have reference  to\t and\ncan  be\t construed  ,only in the  sense\t of  an\t arbitration\nagreement  or an arbitral clause in a  commercial  contract.\nIt cannot mean a commercial contract because an\t arbitration\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">- agreement cannot be stated to have been made pursuant to a\ncommercial ,contract.

(See pages\t1075\nto  1076).  According to the well known work of\t Russell  on\nArbitration,  17th  Edn.,  the English\ttranslation  of\t the\nProtocol  is most obscure.  This is what has been stated  at\npage 79\n\t      &quot;The words of the section, however, would seem\n\t      to  limit\t its operation to cases\t where\tsome\n\t      sort  of &quot;agreement to submit&quot; is followed  by\n\t      an actual &quot;submission&quot; made &quot;pursuant to&quot;\t it.\n\t      (Presumably, the word &quot; submission&quot; here bears\n\t      its natural meaning, of &quot;a submission  written\n\t      or  not)\tof  an\t-  actual  dispute  to\t the\n\t      authority\t of  an arbitral  tribunal,  &quot;rather\n\t      than the statutory meaning which it bore\n\t      under  the 1889 Act and which is now borne  by\n\t      the phrase &quot;arbitration agreement)&quot;.  Thus the\n\t      common  case, of an agreement -to refer  which\n\t      is never followed by a submission because\t the\n\t      claimant prefers to sue instead, is apparently\n\t      outside  the  section, although  the  Protocol\n\t      clearly meant it to be covered; see the French\n\t      text of <a href=\"/doc/1015123/\" id=\"a_52\">Article 4&quot;.</a>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">The  English translation of the French text in the 1950\t Act\nhas  been  stated  to  be a  mistranslating.

In\tthis\ncountry,   as  is  the\tcase  in  England,  the\t treaty\t  or\nInternational\tProtocol  or  convention  does\tnot   become\neffective  or operative of its own force as in some  of\t the\ncontinental  countries unless domestic legislation has\tbeen\nintroduced   to\t attain\t a  specified  result.\t Once,\t the\nParliament has legislated, the, Court must first look at the\nlegislation  and construe the language employed in  it.\t  If\nthe  terms of the legislative enactment do not\tsuffer\tfrom\nany  ambiguity or lack of clarity they must be given  effect\nto  even if -they do not carry out the\ttreaty\tobligations.\nBut  the  treaty or the Protocol or the\t convention  becomes\nimportant  if  the meaning of the expressions  used  by\t the\nParliament  is riot clear and can be construed in more\tthan\none  way.

If\t &quot;submission&quot;  means\n&quot;agreement to refer&quot; or an &quot;arbitral clause&quot; in a commercial\ncontract,  it makes the entire set of  words  unintelligible\nand completely ambiguous.  It is difficult to comprehend  in\nthat  case  why the Legislature should have used  the  words\nwhich  follow  the  term  &quot;submission&quot;,\t namely,  &quot;made\t  in\npursuance  of  an agreement&quot;.  This brings us  to  the\ttrue\nimport\tof the expression &quot;agreement&quot;.\tIf by\t&quot; agreement&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">is  meant a commercial contract of the nature  mentioned  in\nthe,  &quot;Merak&quot;,\tthe words &quot;made in pursuance of&quot;  convey  no\nsense.\t Another anomaly which militates against the  estab-\nlished\trule  of interpretation would arise if by  the\tword\n&quot;agreement&quot; is meant a commercial contract.

Unless the context so compels or requires,\nthe same meaning must ordinarily be ,attributed or given  to\nthe  same words used in the section. The above\tdifficulties\ncompletely  disappear  if &quot;submission&quot;\tisgiven\t the  second\nmeaning\t of an actual submission of a particular dispute  or\ndisputes  to the authority of a particular arbitrator.\t The\nwords which we are construing then have a clear,  consistent\nand intelligible meaning,, namely, an actual submission made\nin pursuance of an arbitration agreement or arbitral  clause\nto  which the convention setforth in the  Schedule  applies.\nThe  words  &quot;in pursuance of&quot; are also thus  saved  and\t not\nrendered otiose.

We are aware  of\nno  rule  of interpretation by which rank ambiguity  can  be\nfirst introduced by giving certain expressions a  particular\nmeaning\t and  then an attempt can be made to emerge  out  of\nsemantic confusion and obscurity by having resort to the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\"> 67</span>\npresumed  intention  of the legislature to  give  effect  to\ninternational obligations.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">It  is\ttrue that by taking the above view the\tpurpose\t and\nobject\tbehind the Protocol and the conventions may  not  be\nfully  carried out.

But we are bound by\t the\nmandate\t of  the  legislature.\tOnce it\t has  expressed\t its\nintention  in  words which have a  clear  signification\t and\nmeaning, the courts are precluded from speculating about the\nreasons\t for  not effectuating the  purpose  underlying\t the\nProtocol  and the conventions.\tThe consistent view  of\t the\nIndian courts on the interpretation of the critical words in<a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_66\">\ns.  3</a>  of  the Act of 1937 has not been in  favour  of\twhat\nprevailed in the &quot;Merak&quot;.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"961181\" id=\"span_12\">In the leading case in <a href=\"/doc/961181/\" id=\"a_67\">W.

Actual\nsubmission has been made a condition precedent for  granting\nstay  but  the\tcourt has been left with  no  discretion  in\nEngland\t and in India.\tIn some of the other  countries\t the\norder for stay of a suit contrary to the arbitral\n(1)  A.I.R. 1959 Cal. 8.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">68</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_30\">clause\tis discretionary, there being no difference  between\nthe   municipal\t arbitration  and  arbitration\t under\t the\nProtocol.   It\twas  presumably for  this  reason  that\t the\nParliament insisted upon a real dispute between the  parties\nand  an actual reference or submission to an arbitration  to\nresolve\t the  particular  point or points in  dispute  as  a\ncondition  for\tstay.  We do not consider that it  would  be\nright  to speculate about the reasons which  prevailed\twith\nthe  Parliament in enacting<a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_69\"> s. 3</a> of the Act in the  language\nin which it has been done.  It is abundantly clear that\t the\nParliament  did not employ language which would indicate  an\nunequivocal  intention that in the presence of an  agreement\nto refer to an arbitral clause in a commercial contract, the\nprovisions  for\t granting  stay\t under\tthe  section   would\nimmediately  become  applicable irrespective  of  an  actual\nsubmission  or a complete reference.  As it was open to\t the\nlegislature  to deviate from the terms -of the Protocol\t and\nthe  Convention\t it appears to have given  only\t -a  limited\neffect\tto the provisions of the 1958 Convention.   A  clear\ndeviation  from\t the rigid and strict rule that\t the  courts\nmust  stay  a  suit  whenever  an  international  commercial\narbitration   as  contemplated\tby  the\t Protocol  and\t the\nConventions, was to take place, is to be found in<a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_70\"> s.3</a>. It is\nof  a nature which is common to all provisions\trelating  to\nstay in English and Indian arbitration laws, the  provisions\nbeing that the application to the court for stay of the suit\nmust be made by a party before filing a written statement or\ntaking any other step in the, proceedings.  If the condition\nis not fulfilled, no stay can be granted.  It cannot thus be\nsaid that<a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_71\"> s. 3</a> of the Act or similar provisions in the prior\nAct  of\t 1937 or the English Statutes were enacted  to\tgive\neffect\tin its entirety to the strict rule contained in\t the\nProtocol and the Conventions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">Another\t significant feature which cannot escape  notice  is\nthat the Parliament in England and India must be presumed to\nhave  been  aware when the <a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_72\">English Act</a> of 1950 and  the\t Act\nwere  enacted  that  the expression  &#x27;submission&#x27;  had\tbeen\nabandoned  in  the Arbitration Acts and, instead,  the\tterm\n&#x27;arbitration  agreement&#x27; had come to be defined\t as  meaning\nwhat  submission meant :according to the definitions in\t the\n<a href=\"/doc/1003813/\" id=\"a_73\">English\t Act</a>  of 1889 and Indian Arbitration  Act  of  1899.\nNotwithstanding\t  this,\t the  expression  &#x27;submission&#x27;\t was\nemployed in <a href=\"/doc/1559255/\" id=\"a_74\">Sec. 4(2)</a> of the English Act of 1950 and <a href=\"/doc/125510/\" id=\"a_75\">Sec.  3</a>\nof the Act.  If the intention was to have the wider  meaning\nthe  proper  and  correct  term\t to  use  was\t&quot;arbitration\nagreement&quot;  and\t logically  those  words  would\t have\tbeen\nemployed.   It\tis  more plausible that\t the  Parliament  by\nretaining the expression &#x27;submission&#x27; wanted to give it\t the\nmeaning\t of an actual submission, as by then there had\tbeen\nfirm expression of opinion in the well-known work of Russell\non Arbitration and by jurists like Prof.  Arthur Nassbaum in\nan article &quot;Treaties on Commercial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\"> 69</span>\nArbitration&quot; in Vol. 56 of the Harvard Law Review,  pointing\nto that meaning being given to &#x27;submission&#x27;. -In India,\t the\nHigh  Courts had uniformally and in unequivocal terms  taken\nthat view. (See W. Wood &amp; Son Ltd.Supra).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_32\">The  language in the relevant article of the  Convention  of\n1958  had also undergone a change.  According to  Art.\t II,\nthe  term &quot;agreement in writing&#x27; was to include an  arbitral\nclause\tin a contract or an arbitration agreement  and\tthat\nterm  was  stated  to mean something by\t which\tthe  parties\nundertook  to submit to arbitration all or  any\t differences\nwhich  had  arisen  or which might  arise  between  them  in\nrespect\t  of   any  defined   legal   relationship   whether\ncontractual  or not concerning a subject matter\t capable  of\nsettlement  by\tarbitration.  Thus, the term  &quot;agreement  in\nwriting&quot;  embraced  an\tarbitral  clause  or  an   agreement\nsimpliciter  to\t refer\tto arbitration\tas  also  an  actual\nsubmission  of\tthe  disputes to  the  arbitrator.   It\t was\nequivalent to &quot;Arbitration Agreement&#x27; as defined in the Act.\nBy  not\t using\tthat term and by  employing  the  expression\n&#x27;submission&#x27;  in  <a href=\"/doc/125510/\" id=\"a_76\">Sec.\t3</a> the  Parliament  appears  to\thave\nindicated  an  intention  to restrict the  meaning  of\tthat\nexpression to an actual submission or a complete reference.\nWhatever way <a href=\"/doc/125510/\" id=\"a_77\">Sec. 3</a> of the Act is looked at, it is difficult\nto reach the conclusion that &#x27;submission&#x27; means an agreement\nto  refer or an arbitral clause and does not mean an  actual\nsubmission  or\tcompleted  reference,  and  that  the  word&#x27;\n&quot;agreement&quot; means a commercial contract and not an agreement\nto refer or an arbitral clause.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">The next question is whether the High Court was justified in\ngranting an interim injunction restraining the Russian\tFirm\nfrom proceeding with arbitration at Moscow.  The position of\nthe  Russian firm is that neither it nor the  Foreign  Trade\nArbitration  Commission of the U.S.S.R. Chamber of  Commerce\nwhich  is seized of the arbitration proceedings is  amenable\nto the jurisdiction of the courts in India.  The presence in\nIndia  of  the party sought to be injuncted is\ta  condition\npre-requisite for the grant of an injunction.  Altematively,\nthe  Indian Firm has been guilty of breach of the  agreement\nto  refer the matter to arbitration at Moscow and  therefore\nit  has\t disentitled itself to the exercise of\tthe  Court&#x27;s\ndiscretion  in\tits  favour in the  matter  of\tgranting  an\ninjunction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">Now,  it is common ground that the point  about-the  Russian\nFirm  having  no representative in India  was  not  agitated\nbefore\tthe High Court.\t The position taken up in the  plant\nwas  that the Russian Firm was carrying on business  in\t the\nU.S.S.R.  and  at Madras.

In the present case if there\t was\nany such reference to arbitration it was only on November 4,\n1967,  that  is, about three weeks after the suit  bad\tbeen\nfiled  in the High Court.  The contrary view point  was\t put\nforward by Mr. Mohan Kumaramangalam on behalf of the  appel-\nlant.\tIt  was\t said  that  s. 3  of,\tthe  Act  should  be\ninterpreted in the context of the articles of the Convention\nset out in the schedule and it was not necessary that  there\nshould\tbe an actual submission to, arbitration\t before\t the\ninstitution  of the suit.  If there was an  arbitral  clause\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_46\">-whether  this was followed by reference to  arbitration  by\nany of the parties or not the very existence of this  clause\nin  the commercial agreement would render stay of  the\tsuit\nmandatory under<a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_94\"> s. 3</a> of the Act.  The argument was that <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_95\">art.\n2</a> of the Convention makes it clear that under the Convention\nthe court of contracting State must, when seized of such  an\naction\trefer the parties to arbitration.  <a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_96\">Section 3</a> of\t the\nAct  must be read in consonance with this  obligation.\t Any\ninterpretation\tof  that section which\twill  restrict\tthis\nobligation  could  be  justified only  if  the\tplain  words\nnecessitate  such a reading.  The argument of the  appellant\nis  that  the words &quot;if any party to a\tsubmission  made  in\npursuance of an agreement to which the convention set  forth\nin the schedule applies&quot; really mean that the submission  is\nthe arbitral clause itself\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">\t\t\t     75</span>\nand  the agreement is a commercial agreement which  includes\nor embodies that clause.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">It  is\tnecessary  in  this  connection\t to  refer  to\t the\nlegislative history of the section.

This  is\t  an\n\t      offshoot of the somewhat optimistic assumption\n\t      that the legislature must be presumed to\tknow\n\t      the actual state of the law.  Consequently, if\n\t      a\t word  has  once  been\tgiven  a  particular\n\t      meaning  in  any case of\tauthority,  however,\n\t      obscure,\tin  connection\twith  any   statute,\n\t      however recondite, the draftsman who uses that\n\t      word  in\ta later enactment is, so  to  speak,\n\t      &#x27;affected\t  with\tnotice&#x27;\t of   the   judicial\n\t      interpretation, however remote it may be\tfrom\n\t      the  matter in hand.

It was held in these\t cases\tthat\nbefore\tthe  court stays proceedings under<a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_144\"> s. 3</a> of  the\t Act\nthere  must be an actual submission by both the\t parties  to\narbitrators  of\t the particular point in  dispute.   It\t was\nargued that in enacting<a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_145\"> s. 3</a> Parliament was not content with\na mere readiness of the parties to go to arbitration but  it\ninsisted on something mote, that is, the actual\t implementa-\ntion  of the arbitration agreement by the parties  concerned\nby setting up the machinery of arbitration in motion.  I  am\nunable\tto  accept this line of reasoning.  It is  not\tsaid\nthat  there  is\t a long course of practice or  a  series  of\ndecisions of various High Courts taking a particular view of<a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_146\">\ns.  3</a>  of  the\tAct.</span></span>   The  decisions  referred\t to  by\t the\nrespondent  are\t not  numerous -and, it is  unsafe  and\t un-\nrealistic  to  draw the presumption that Parliament  in\t re-\nenacting  s.  3\t of the Act was\t aware\tof  the\t intervening\njudicial  interpretation and set its seal of  approval\tupon\nit.   In R. v. Bow Road Domestic Proceedings  Court(5)\tLord\nDenning\t pointed  out  that though the\tdecision  in  R.  v.\nBlane(6)  stood\t for  over 100 years, if  it  was  quite  au\nerroneous precedent, the fact that Parliament had  reenacted\nthe  provisions\t of  the  statute,  did\t not  authorise\t the\nerroneous interpretation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">(1)  [19331 A.C. 402.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">(3)  A.I.R. 1959 cal. 8.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">(5)  [1968] 2 All, E.

So the\nword &quot;agreement&quot; can have reference to and can be  construed\nonly  in the sense of an arbitration agreement\tor  arbitral\nclause\tin  a  commercial  contract.   It  can-not  mean   a\ncommercial contract because an arbitration agreement  cannot\nbe  stated  to\thave  been made\t pursuant  to  a  commercial\ncontract.   The contention is that if submission has  to  be\ntaken  in  the sense of an arbitration -agreement  it  would\nrender\tthe  words  &quot;submisison\t made  in  pursuance  of  an\nagreement&quot;  meaningless and unintelligible.  In\t my  opinion\nthe argument proceeds on a fallacy.  A statute should not be\nconstrued  as  a theorem of Euclid but the statute  must  be\nconstrued  with some imagination of the purpose\t which\tlies\nbehind the statute.  The doctrine of literal  interpretation\nis not always the best method for ascertaining the intention\nof Parliament.\tThe better rule of interpretation is that  a\nstatute\t should be so construed as to prevent  the  mischief\nand -advance the remedy according to the true intent of\t the\nmakers\tof  the\t statute.  The principle  was  for  example,\napplied\t by  Lord Halsbury in Eastman  Photographic  Co.  v.\nComptroller of Patents(1) where the question was whether the\nword  &#x27;solio&#x27;  used  as a trademark was\t an  invented  or  a\ndescriptive word.  In examining this question Lord  Halsbury\nsaid:  &quot;Among  the things which have passed into  canons  of\nconstruction  recorded in Heydon&#x27;s case we are to  see\twhat\nwas  the  law before the Act was passed, and  what  was\t the\nmischief or defect for which the law had not provided,\twhat\nremedy\tParliament appointed and the reason of the  remedy&quot;.\nAt p. 575 Lord Halsbury proceeded to state\n\t      Turner, L.J. in Hawkins v. Cathercole(2),\t and\n\t      adding  his own high authority to that of\t the\n\t      judges   in  Stredling  v.  Morgan(3)   -after\n\t      enforcing\t the proposition that the  intention\n\t      of the Legislature must be regarded, at length\n\t      the  judgment  in that case :  that  the\thave\n\t      collected\t the intention &#x27;sometimes by  consi-\n\t      dering  the cause and necessity of making\t the\n\t      Act....\tsometimes   foreign   circumstances&#x27;\n\t      (thereby meaning extraneous circumstances), so\n\t      that they have ever been guided by the  intent\n\t      of  the  Legislature, which they\thave  always\n\t      taken  according\tto  the\t necessity  of\t the\n\t      matter,\tand  according\tto  that  which\t  is\n\t      consonant to reason and good discretion&#x27;.\t And\n\t      he adds : &quot;We have, therefore, to consider not\n\t      merely the words of this Act of Parlia-\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">\t      (1)  [1898]  A.C.\t 571.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">\t      (2) [1855] 6 D.

Chamber of Commerce at Moscow.\nIt is not, however, possible to decide these appeals finally\nbecause the respondent has opposed the application for\tstay\non  other  grounds  also.  Ramamurti,  J.,  found  that\t the\narbitral  clause  in the contract of February  2,  1965\t had\nteased to be effective as between the parties as a result of\nthe  agreement dated August 14, 1966 Ex.  P-32 &quot;and that  it\nwill  be wholly unrealistic. . . to hold that the moment  an\namicable settlement as provided in Ex.\tP-32 proved  futile,\nthe  entire  contract,\tEx.  P-4 revived. . .  .  &quot;  On\t the\nfurther\t aspect\t that  admittedly<a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_148\"> s. 3</a>\titself\tcontains  an\nexception  that\t the  mandatory obligation to  stay  is\t not\nincumbent  on the court if the court is satisfied that\t&quot;the\nagreement  is  null and void, inoperative  or  incapable  of\nbeing  performed&quot; Ramamurti, J. was apparently of  the\tview\nthat  the  alleged nullity of the contract on the  basis  of\nmutual\tmistake was, a matter that the court has to  examine\nfurther\t after recording evidence and that was a  ground  on\nwhich proceedings cannot be stayed under<a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_149\"> s. 3</a>.\nI  consider,  therefore,  that C.A. 1209 and  1834  of\t1969\nshould be set down for further hearing on these points.\nCivil  Appeals Nos. 1208 and 1833 of 1969 arise out  of\t the\napplication  No. 106 of 1968 filed by the  first  respondent\nfor  injunction to restrain the first respondent for  taking\nfurther\t part  in  the arbitration  proceedings\t in  Moscow.\nRamamurti  J., took the view that since the application\t no.\n2604 of 1967 for stay of the proceedings in the pending suit\nC.S. II 8 of 1967 bad been dismissed the first\trespondent&#x27;s\ninjunction petition should be allowed on the ground that the\ntwo  forums  were  mutually  exclusive.\t  In  the  connected\nappeals\t I have taken the view that the appellant  would  be\nentitled to an order of stay of the proceedings in C.S.\t 118\nof 1967 under<a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_150\"> s. 3</a> of Act 45 of 1961.  Even assuming that<a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_151\"> S.\n3</a> of the Act is not applicable this is not a proper case  in\nwhich  the  High  Court should\thave  issued  an  injunction\nrestraining   the   appellant  from  proceeding\t  with\t the\narbitration.   As  a  rule the Court  has  to  exercise\t its\ndiscretion  with great circumspection for it  is  imperative\nthat the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">\t\t\t     87</span>\nright of access to the tribunals of a country should not  be\nlightly\t interfered  with.  It is not sufficient  merely  to\nshow that two actions have been started for it is not  prima\nfacie  vexations  to  commence two actions  about  the\tsame\nsubject\t matter, one here and one abroad. (See\tMcttenry  v.\nLewis(1).   The\t reason of this reluctance to  exercise\t the\njurisdiction is that owing to a possible difference  between\nthe  laws  of  the two countries, the stay  of\tone  of\t the\nactions may deprive the plaintiff of some advantage which he\nis  justified  in  pursuing.  Thus he may  have\t a  personal\nremedy in one country and a remedy only against the goods in\nanother;  or a remedy against land in one State but no\tsuch\nremedy in another.  The rule &#x27; therefore, is that a plea  of\nlis  alibi pendens will not succeed and the court  will\t not\norder  a  stay of proceedings unless  the  defendant  proves\nvexation in point of fact.  He must show that the  continued\nprosecution  of both actions is oppressive or  embarrassing,\nan onus which he will find it difficult to discharge if\t the\nplaintiff  can\tindicate  some material\t advantage  that  is\nlikely\tto  result from each separate  action.\t Each  case,\ntherefore,  depends  upon the setting of its own  facts\t and\ncircumstances.\t In  the facts of the present case I  am  of\nopinion\t that no case for injunction has been made  out\t and\nthe  order of Ramamurti, J., dated April 12.  1968  allowing\nthe  application of respondent in no. 106 of 1968 should  be\nset -aside.  I would accordingly allow the appeals nos. 1208\nof 1969 and 1833 of 1969 with costs.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_69\">\t\t\t   ORDER\nIn  accordance with the opinion of the majority the  appeals\nare dismissed.\tThere will be no order as to costs.\nY.P.\n(1) 22 Ch.
