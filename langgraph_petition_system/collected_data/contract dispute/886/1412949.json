W.P. No.1398 of 2002 (for short &quot;the first petition&quot;)\n\n     &amp;  W.P. (C) No.1781 of 2007 (for short &quot;the second\n\n     petition&quot;), involve the same question of law and common\n\n     facts and as such they are being considered and disposed\n\n     of by this common order.  However, for the purpose of this\n\n     order the facts, as mentioned in the first petition are\n\n     being referred.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.   The indisputable facts, in nutshell, as projected by\nthe petitioner - Bharat Aluminium Company Ltd. (for short\n&quot;BALCO&quot;), are that vide invitation to tenders dated 6-11-\n1997 &amp; 7-11-1997 (Annexures - P/1 &amp; P/2, respectively to\nthe first petition), BALCO invited tenders from the\ninterested parties for civil and structural works for\ninstallation of New Cold Rolling Mills Project at Korba\nAluminium Complex.  Pursuant to the said tender notices,\nthe respondent - Engineering Projects (India) Limited (for\nshort &quot;EPIL&quot;) submitted its offer to the aforesaid works\non 23-12-1997 &amp; 24-12-1997 (Annexures - P/3 &amp; P/4, \nrespectively to the first petition).  On due\nconsideration, vide letter of intents dated      16-7-1998\n(Annexures - P/5 &amp; P/6 to the first petition) BALCO placed\nthe order in favour of EPIL.  Thereafter, both the\ncompanies executed agreements on 7-1-1999 &amp; 1-2-1999   \n(Annexures - P/7 &amp; P/8, respectively to the first\npetition).  Under clause 9.22.1 of the general terms &amp;\nconditions of the contract i.e. Schedule 9 of the contract\nagreement, they agreed to resolve the disputes and\ndifferences arising out of contract by way of arbitration\n(for short &quot;the arbitration agreement&quot;) (Annexure - P/9 to\nthe first petition).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">3.   On 2-3-2001 Government of India divested 51% of its\nshareholding in BALCO in favour of Sterlite Industries\n(India) Ltd. (for short &quot;Sterlite&quot;) and accordingly the\nmanagement of BALCO was transferred in favour of Sterlite.\nTherefrom BALCO has ceased to be a Public Sector  \nUndertaking (for short &quot;PSU&quot;), and became joint venture.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_5\">4.   Some disputes and differences arose between BALCO and  \nEPIL.  Accordingly, EPIL invoked the arbitration clause by\nway of letter dated 31-5-2001.  Thereafter, the Government\nof India, Ministry of Mines vide its letter dated 23-7-\n2001 (Annexure - P/10 to the first petition) sought\ncomments from BALCO with regard to the arbitration.  BALCO  \nvide its letter dated 9-8-2001 (Annexure - P/11 to the\nfirst petition) objected the arbitration to be conducted\nunder the Permanent Machinery of Arbitration (for short\n&quot;the PMA&quot;), on the ground that BALCO did not remain a PSU  \nafter its disinvestment on 2-3-2001.  However, BALCO\nagreed for the arbitration being conducted as per the\nprocedure applicable for other than Public Sector\nEnterprises and Government Departments i.e. arbitration\nunder the Indian Council of Arbitration.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">5.   In spite of the aforesaid facts, BALCO received a\ncommunication dated 19-12-2001 from Shri N.C. Jain \n(respondent No.3 in the first petition) stating that he\nhad been appointed as the Sole Arbitrator in the matter\nand had entered upon the reference under the PMA.  Shri\nJain further directed BALCO to file its statement of\nclaim, reply and counter claim, if any, and fixed the\nmatter for 14-3-2002.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">6.   Since BALCO has not received any response to its\nobjection regarding the jurisdiction of the PMA, BALCO\nfiled its reply and counter claim for an amount of\nRs.45.20 crores.  In the said reply and counter claim\nBALCO raised the preliminary objection questioning the\njurisdiction of the arbitrator under the PMA and submitted\nthat the said reference was void ab initio on the ground\nthat BALCO was not a PSU when the arbitration proceedings  \ncommenced or when the said clause was invoked by EPIL.   \nEPIL filed its claim for an amount of Rs.5,57,20,522=56\nfor civil works and an amount of Rs.6,15,72,560=38 for\nstructural works.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">7.   On 14-3-2002, during the course of arguments, BALCO \nraised the aforesaid objection before the arbitrator, but\nthe said contention was rejected by the arbitrator vide\norder dated                 21-3-2002 (Annexure - P/15 to\nthe first petition) and fixed the matter for regular\nhearing on 22-5-2002.  Thereafter, BALCO by its letter\ndated 6-5-2002 (Annexure - P/16 to the first petition)\ninformed the arbitrator that they authorized M/s Kessar\nDass &amp; B. Associates, Advocates, Solicitors &amp; Consultants \nto represent BALCO in the arbitration proceedings.\nThereafter, on                      20-5-2002 (Annexure -\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">P/17 to the first petition) the Advocate of BALCO moved an\napplication before the arbitrator and stated that the\nvenue of the arbitration would be at Korba and sought\nappropriate direction.  EPIL filed an application vide\nAnnexure - P/18 to  the first petition opposing the\nappointment of Advocates by BALCO under the PMA Rules and    \nsought a direction towards BALCO to represent through its\nofficials only.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">8.   In view of the aforesaid objection raised by EPIL,\nM/s Kesar Dass &amp; B. Associates did not appear before the \nArbitrator on                  22-5-2002 and the matter\nwas represented by the officials of BALCO.  The arbitrator\nrejected the application of BALCO with regard to venue of\narbitration proceedings and adjourned the matter to 25-7-\n2002 by order dated 22-5-2002 (Annexure - P/20 to the\nfirst petition).  Thus, BALCO filed the first petition\nbefore this Court on 12-7-2002.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">9.   This Court on 19-7-2002 passed an order in the first\npetition to the effect that &quot;Meanwhile, if the meeting, if\nany, is held by the arbitrator, the decision thereof shall\nbe subject to the orders to be passed by this Court&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_12\">10.  During pendency of the first petition before this\nCourt, the Ministry of Heavy Industries and Public\nEnterprises, Government of India, issued an office\nmemorandum (for short &quot;OM&quot;) dated 22-1-2004 (Annexure -  \nP/21 to the first petition) directing that the procedure\nfor settlement of disputes under the PMA will be\napplicable even to a Public Sector Enterprise, which has\nceased to be the same, by reason of privatization due to\ndisinvestment or otherwise.  Thereafter, BALCO filed\namendment application (I.A.No.1) in the first petition on\n12-3-2007, which was allowed by this Court on 30-3-2007.\nAccordingly, the amended writ petition was filed by BALCO\non 7-4-2007.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_13\">11.  BALCO also filed the second petition {W.P (C) No.1781\nof 2007} before this Court on 12-3-2007 in which it has\nbeen mentioned that BALCO was disinvested by the  \nGovernment of India on                 2-3-2001, as a\nresult of which BALCO ceased to be a PSU.  In the second \npetition, BALCO challenged the legality and validity of\nthe OM dated 22-1-2004. \n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"619283\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"1317895\" id=\"span_2\">12.  Shri Ratnanko Banerjee, learned counsel appearing\nwith Shri Tarun Aich and Shri Ghanshyam Patel, learned\nAdvocates for BALCO would submit that the PMA could   \nresolve the disputes only when there is a dispute or\ndifference between the PSUs and the Government Departments   \nto avoid wastage of public money and time, as all the\ninter departmental controversies may be settled at the\nGovernment level only in the light of observations made by\nthe Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1317895/\" id=\"a_3\">Oil and Natural Gas Commission and  \nAnother v. Collector of Central Excise1</a>  and <a href=\"/doc/619283/\" id=\"a_4\">Oil and\nNatural Gas Commission and Another v. Collector of Central\nExcise2  Accordingly</a>, several OMs were issued by the \nGovernment of India on 12-3-1985, 29-3-1989,  31-12-1991 &amp;\n24-1-1994 for setting up the PMA.</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"641435\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1302364\" id=\"span_4\">13.  Shri Banerjee would further submit that forum of the\nPMA may not have jurisdiction to deal with the subject\nmatter, as after disinvestment the Government loses\ncontrol over the present BALCO and, as such, the PMA also \nloses its jurisdiction.  Thus, jurisdiction of the PMA\nwould not continue, as the present BALCO is not a PSU. \nLearned counsel placed his reliance upon the decision of\nthe Supreme Court rendered in <a href=\"/doc/1302364/\" id=\"a_5\">Jindal Vijayanagar Steel\n(JSW Steel Ltd.) v. Jindal Praxair Oxygen Co. Ltd.3</a> and\nupon the decision of the Bombay High Court rendered in\n<a href=\"/doc/641435/\" id=\"a_6\">Fazlehussein Haiderbhoy Buxamusa and Others v. Yusufally  \nAdamji and Others4</a>.</span></span> \n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">14.  Shri Banerji would next submit that the arbitration\nclauses 9.22.1 and 9.22.2 are unambiguous and need no  \nfurther interpretation.  The plain language of the\narbitration clause clearly provides for dispute resolution\nby the PMA only when disputes and differences arose \nbetween the PSUs and the Government Departments.  A    \ndispute and difference arising between a non-PSU and a PSU \ncan be adjudicated by the PMA under the first part of\nclause 9.22.1 of the contract.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"190681\" id=\"span_5\">In support of his\ncontention, Shri Banerji relies on a decision of the\nSupreme Court rendered in <a href=\"/doc/190681/\" id=\"a_7\">Eastern Coalfields Limited v.\nSanjay Transport Agency and Another5</a>.</span>  \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1737583\" id=\"span_6\">15.  Shri  Banerjee would also submit that the  Supreme\n\n     Court in <a href=\"/doc/1737583/\" id=\"a_8\">BALCO Employees&#x27; Union (Regd.) v. Union of India\n\n     and Others6</a> at para 60, observed that as a result of\n\n     disinvestment of 51% of the shares of the Company, the\n\n     management and control, no doubt, has gone into private\n\n     hands and, as such, by change of the status of BALCO, the\n\n     employees would no longer be entitled to protection of\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_9\">Articles 12</a><a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_10\">, 14</a><a href=\"/doc/211089/\" id=\"a_11\">, 16</a> and <a href=\"/doc/47623/\" id=\"a_12\">311</a> of the Constitution of India.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">     Thus, likewise, in the case on hand, after disinvestment,\n\n     the present BALCO became a private company and the forum  \n\n     of the PMA would not be applicable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">16.  Shri Banerjee would further submit that BALCO has\nalso disclosed the shareholders agreement and share \npurchase agreement with the Government of India dated 2-3-\n2001 pursuant to which the shares were divested, in the\napplication filed in the first petition on 3-9-2010 from\nwhich it will be evident that there is no clause with\nregard to BALCO being obliged to appear before the PMA for\nadjudication of disputes after disinvestment.  In fact,\nclause 7.6 of the share purchase agreement which lists the\npending suit, action, litigation or arbitration\nproceedings or claim pending against BALCO, there is no\nreference to the claim of EPIL in the particulars given in\nschedule 7.6.  This clearly shows that the Government\nnever contemplated any pending arbitration by the process\nof the PMA as against BALCO, for the claim of EPIL.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">17.  Shri Banerjee would next contend that the PMA and the\nGovernment of India very well knew that a new agreement\nwould be required for method of arbitration and the same\nis evident from the orders dated 9-3-2010, 10-5-2010 and\n26-7-2010 of the PMA.  The PMA wanted BALCO to sign on the   \nnew agreement, as is evident from the application dated 21-\n6-2010 in the second petition.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">18.  The impugned OM dated 22-1-2004 is wholly without \njurisdiction.  The Government is only a minority\nshareholder in BALCO and, as such, the OM dated 22-1-2004  \nwould not be applicable whereby a unilateral change in the\narbitration agreement was sought to be introduced without\nany authority of law between a PSU and a private\nundertaking i.e. BALCO.  Thus, the OM      dated 22-1-2004\nis illegal, unjustified and without any authority of law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_22\">19.  Shri Banerjee would further submit that the office\nmemorandum dated 22-1-2004 has been issued in an illegal \nand arbitrary manner without having jurisdiction and\nagainst the principles of settled law.  The Ministry of\nHeavy Industries and Public Enterprise cannot impose a\nsettlement procedure of PMA on BALCO by issuing the office \nmemorandum dated 22-1-2004.  The said memorandum has been      \nissued with mala fide intention and with some ulterior\nmotive.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">20.  It is further contended by Shri Banerjee that by\nreason of subsequent events, it is well settled that even\nthe Court may lose jurisdiction over the subject matter.\nEPIL very well knew the fact that in the event BALCO\nbecomes a private under taking on account of any reasons\nmay be disinvestment, the second part of the arbitration\nagreement would be applicable.  BALCO has objected the  \njurisdiction of the PMA in its letter dated 9-8-2001 and\neven in the reply and counter claim filed by BALCO before\nthe arbitrator there was a preliminary objection with\nregard to jurisdiction of the PMA, which was rejected by\nthe PMA on              21-3-2002.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">21.  On the other hand, Shri Sunil Otwani, Advocate\nappearing for EPIL, would submit that the disputes and\ndifferences arose between BALCO and EPIL prior to change  \nof Management of ownership in BALCO and claims were lodged   \nby EPIL before BALCO vide letters dated 7-10-2000, 16-11-\n2000 and 5-2-2001 (Annexure - R2/6, R2/7 &amp; R2/8, \nrespectively to the second petition).  The said claims\nwere rejected by BALCO on                         3/5-2-\n2001 &amp; 12-2-2001 (Annexure - R2/9 &amp; R2/10, respectively,\nto the second petition).  Therefore, the contract cannot\nbe altered merely because one party to the contract\nsubsequently became a joint venture company due to the \nchange of management of the company and could not possible  \naffect or nullify.  BALCO has not approached this Court\nwith clean hands and has made incorrect and misconceived \naverments in this petition.  In fact, the OM was issued by\nthe authorities by exercising their power properly,\nlawfully and in the interest of public at large.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_25\">22.  Shri Otwani would further submit that admittedly the\nOM was issued on 22-1-2004 whereas BALCO challenged the     \nsame after lapse of more than three years and, as such,\nthe petition may be dismissed on the ground of delay and\nlaches.  Even otherwise, BALCO has failed to make out any \ncase in its favour.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">23.  Ms.  Fouzia,  Mirza,  learned Assistant  Solicitor\n\n     General appearing for the Union of India, would submit\n\n     that the Government of India has rightly and correctly\n\n     issued the OM.  There is no arbitrariness in issuing the\n\n     OM dated 22-1-2004 and the Government of India is the only\n\n     authority as per the law of the land to issue such\n\n     guidelines.  Ms. Mirza would further submit that as per\n\n     the arbitration clause executed between the parties, the\n\n     award of the arbitrator in the PMA shall be binding upon\n\n     the parties to the dispute.  No legal right or vested\n\n     right of BALCO is effected by the OM dated 22-1-2004.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">     BALCO and its shareholders are bound by the obligation\n\n     under the contract and terms &amp; conditions thereof already\n\n     entered into by BALCO prior to its disinvestment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">24.  Ms. Mirza would next submit that since the initial\nagreement was singed between the then BALCO and EPIL    \n(PSUs), on advice, it is submitted that the arbitration\nagreement as signed earlier would be applicable to the\npresent management of BALCO also.  The present BALCO is    \nnot a private company, but it has become a joint venture\non its disinvestment, as 51% of the shareholdings have\ngone in favour of Sterlite.  The PMA has the jurisdiction\nto interpret the arbitration clause and to decide asto\nwhether the present BALCO would be governed under the PMA.   \nThe OM dated 22-1-2004 was one of the several guidelines\nissued by the Government of India from time to time, which\nis not applicable to BALCO, but all the Enterprises\nwherein the PSUs after their respective disinvestment have\ngone into the hands of the private parties.  Thus, the\nGovernment of India is fully competent to issue the OM\ndated 22-1-2004.  It is a policy matter and the same\ncannot be challenged before any Court.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">25.  I have heard learned counsel appearing for the\nparties, perused the pleadings and the documents appended \nthereto.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_30\">26.  It is evident that to execute civil and structural\nworks agreements were executed between the then BALCO and     \nEPIL on 7-1-1999 &amp; 1-2-1999.  The Arbitration agreement\nprovides for settling all the disputes and differences\narising between the parties by the method, as specified\ntherein.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_31\">27.

The objection of BALCO was   \nrejected by the arbitrator on 21-3-2002 (Annexure - P/15\nto the first petition) holding that the PMA has\njurisdiction to decide the arbitration case between BALCO\nand EPIL.

It\n               is    also   not   necessary   that\n               agreement  to  arbitration   should\n               appear  in  the document containing\n               the   other   terms  of   agreement\n               between  the parties. Law  is  well\n               settled that arbitration clause may\n               be  incorporated by reference to  a\n               specific  document  which   is   in\n               existence   and  whose  terms   are\n               easily ascertainable. It is  to  be\n               noted,  however, that the  question\n               whether   or  not  the  arbitration\n               clause    contained   in    another\n               document  is  incorporated  in  the\n               contract,  is always a question  of\n               construction.  It  should  also  be\n               noted  that the arbitration  clause\n               is  quite  distinct from the  other\n               clauses  of  the  contract.   Other\n               clauses    of   agreement    impose\n               obligation   which   the    parties\n               undertake  towards each other.  But\n               arbitration clause does not  impose\n               on   any   of   the   parties   any\n               obligation in favour of  the  other\n               party.  Such arbitration  agreement\n               embodies  an agreement between  the\n               parties  that in case of a dispute,\n               such  dispute shall be  settled  by\n               arbitrator, or umpire of their  own\n               constitution or by an arbitrator to\n               be  appointed by the  Court  in  an\n               appropriate  case. It is  pertinent\n               to mention that there is a material\n               difference    in   an   arbitration\n               agreement   inasmuch   as   in   an\n               ordinary contract the obligation of\n               the  parties to each other  cannot,\n               in    general,    be   specifically\n               enforced  and breach of such  terms\n               of   contract   results   only   in\n               damages.  The  arbitration   clause\n               however    can    be   specifically\n               enforced  by the machinery  of  the\n               <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_15\">Arbitration  Act</a>.  The  appropriate\n               remedy  for breach of an  agreement\n               to  arbitrate is enforcement of the\n               agreement to arbitrate and  not  to\n               damages arising out of such breach.\n               Moreover,   there  is   a   further\n               significant difference  between  an\n               ordinary    agreement    and     an\n               arbitration   agreement.   In    an\n               arbitration agreement,  the  courts\n               have    discretionary   power    of\n               dispensation of a valid arbitration\n               agreement  but the courts  have  no\n               such power of dispensation of other\n               terms  of contract entered  between\n               the  parties. This very distinctive\n               feature   of   an   agreement   for\n               arbitration has been highlighted in\n               the  decision in Heyman v.  Darwins\n               Ltd.  It  has  been held  in  North\n               Western    Rubber    Company    and\n               Huttenbach &amp; Co., Re (overruled  in\n               Produce Brokers Co. v.

No party can say he will\n               be  bound by only one part  of  the\n               agreement  and not the other  part,\n               unless    such   other   part    is\n               impossible  of  performance  or  is\n               void   being   contrary   to    the\n               provisions  of  the Act,  and  such\n               part   is   severable   from    the\n               remaining  part  of the  agreement.\n               The arbitration clause is a package\n               which may provide for what disputes\n               are  arbitrable, at what stage  the\n               disputes are arbitrable, who should\n               be  the arbitrator, what should  be\n               the  venue,  what law would  govern\n               the  parties, etc. A party  to  the\n               contract  cannot claim the  benefit\n               of     arbitration    under     the\n               arbitration clause, but ignore  the\n               appointment  procedure relating  to\n               the  named arbitrator contained  in\n               the arbitration clause.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_20\">                    15. It is now well settled  by\n               a series of decisions of this Court\n               that   arbitration  agreements   in\n               government contracts providing that\n               an   employee  of  the   Department\n               (usually     a    high     official\n               unconnected  with the work  or  the\n               contract)  will be the  arbitrator,\n               are      neither      void      nor\n               unenforceable..&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_39\">35.  There is no dispute that the contract agreement as\n\n     well as the arbitration agreement was duly singed by the\n\n     then  BALCO and EPIL.  According to the terms  and\n\n     conditions and further in respect of the method of\n\n     resolution of disputes and differences neither EPIL nor\n\n     BALCO has raised the dispute before other party to the\n\n     dispute in respect of arbitration clause.  BALCO has also\n\n     not asked EPIL to invoke arbitration in accordance with\n\n     the Rules of Arbitration of Indian Council of Arbitration,\n\nthough all the disputes were pending before the Government\n\n     of India. If BALCO was under the impression that the\n\n     dispute could be resolved only under the method prescribed\n\n     in the agreement and in accordance with the Rules of\n\n     Indian Council of Arbitration, BALCO ought to have written\n\n     to the other party i.e. EPIL and on failure, ought to have\n\n     taken recourse to other statutory forum that may be\n\n     available under the provisions of law.  Objection was\n\n     raised under the settlement method, which was sought to be\n\n     enforced for PSUs and the Government departments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">36.  On perusal of clause 9.22.1 of the Arbitration\nagreement, it appears that the first part was applicable\nin respect of the dispute between EPIL and BALCO and the \nsecond part of resolution of dispute in accordance with\nthe Rules of Indian Council of Arbitration was referable\nto the dispute, which arose between other than Public\nSector Enterprise and Government department. \n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">37.  By no stretch of imagination, it can be held that the\nsecond clause for settlement of dispute for other Public\nSector Enterprise and Government department was  \nincorporated keeping in view that in future management of\nBALCO may be changed on account of its disinvestment.  It \ncannot be held that the second clause would be applicable\nin case of disputes and differences between BALCO and \nEPIL.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">38.

In   my   opinion   the\n               construction   of  an   arbitration\n               clause   should  start   from   the\n               assumption  that  the  parties,  as\n               rational businessmen, are likely to\n               have  intended any dispute  arising\n               out  of the relationship into which\n                    they have entered or purported to\n               enter  to  be decided by  the  same\n               tribunal.

It is true that there must\n               be  an  arbitration  agreement,  to\n               confer    jurisdiction    on    the\n               arbitrator  to hear and decide  the\n               dispute.  Where there  is  no  such\n               agreement there is an initial  want\n               of jurisdiction. That is why it has\n               been  impressed by courts that  one\n               of  the  essential  ingredients  of\n               submission to arbitration  is  that\n               the  parties should agree that  the\n               dispute should be determined by  an\n               arbitrator.  Where  there   is   an\n               arbitration  clause in a  contract,\n               it  amounts  to two contracts  into\n               one,  one relating to the execution\n               of the work entrusted in the manner\n               prescribed  and the  other  how  to\n               resolve  the dispute in  event  any\n               such  dispute arises in respect  of\n               the  said  contract.  Whenever  one\n               party  to the dispute asserts  that\n               there  is  an arbitration agreement\n               by  which the parties had agreed to\n               refer  the dispute to an arbitrator\n               which is disputed and challenged by\n               the  other  party to the agreement,\n               it   has   to   be   examined   and\n               determined.   To   constitute   &quot;an\n               arbitration agreement&quot;  it  is  not\n               necessary  that there should  be  a\n               formal agreement or that the  terms\n               should  all  be  contained  in  one\n               document. All that is necessary  is\n               that  from documents it must appear\n               that  the  parties  had  agreed  to\n               submit     present    or     future\n               differences to arbitration.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_54\">50.  The contention of the learned counsel appearing for\n\n     the petitioner that mechanism of the PMA is not binding on\n\n     the present management of BALCO is unmerited.  The PMA was   \n\n     created admittedly to resolve the disputes and differences\n\n     arising between the PSUs and the Government Departments \n\nand between the PSUs and PSUs, as explained in the  OMs   \n\n     dated 12-3-1985, 29-3-1989, 31-12-1991 &amp; 24-1-1994 for\n\n     setting up the PMA. (See Oil and Natural Gas Commission\n\n     (supra1), Oil and Natural Gas Commission (supra2) and\n\n     Chief Conservator of Forests, Govt. of A.P. v.

It is\nnot a case where for the first time the PMA mechanism is\nbeing enforced on the present management of BALCO. The PMA    \nmechanism was accepted by the parties by way of an  \narbitration agreement, when BALCO and EPIL were PSUs.  Now    \nafter disinvestment, the management of BALCO has been  \ntransferred to the present management of BALCO on holding \nof 51% shares.  Thus, there is no question of enforcement\nof the PMA mechanism, but the method to resolve the \ndisputes is derived from the agreement signed between the\nparties, which have come down in succession to the present\nmanagement of BALCO.  BALCO is admittedly a joint venture.  \nIt is not a private enterprise, wherein all shares are\nheld by a private party (parties).\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"193739374\" id=\"span_16\">52.

The\n               High  Court has taken note of  this\n               connotation   of   the   expression\n               &quot;joint venture&quot;. But the High Court\n               has  held that NHL is not  a  joint\n               venture  and that there is  only  a\n               certain     amount    of     equity\n               participation by a foreign  company\n               in  it. We are unable to agree with\n               the said view of the High Court.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">53.  The  OM  dated  22-1-2004  is  not  applicable  or\n\n     indisputable by itself.  The OM has to be followed by an\n\n     agreement.  Admittedly, in the case on hand, there is no\n\n     arbitration agreement between the parties following the OM\n\n     dated 22-1-2004.  Thus, the same would not have any effect\n\n     on the relationship of the parties, which is derived from\n\n     the arbitration agreement executed between BALCO and EPIL. \n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_58\">54.  The  validity of the OM dated 22-1-2004 cannot  be\n\n     decided  in the case on hand, as it is an enabling\n\n     circular, which comes into effect only if both the parties\n\n     agree and sign the arbitration agreement accordingly.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_59\">     Thus, no opinion is expressed on the validity of the OM\n\n     dated 22-1-2004.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">55.  For the reasons mentioned hereinabove, there is no\nillegality or infirmity in the orders dated 19-12-2001, 21-\n3-2002 &amp; 22-5-2002 passed by the arbitrator.  Even\notherwise, it well settled principle of law that the\nobjection to jurisdiction of the Arbitral Tribunal cannot\nbe questioned under the writ jurisdiction.  The same may\nbe questioned at the appropriate stage as and when it is\navailable to the petitioner.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">56.  Thus, for the reasons and analysis aforestated, I do\nnot find any merit in the petitions, warranting\ninterference with the resolution method of the PMA.\nAccordingly, both the writ petitions are dismissed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_62\">57.  There shall be no order asto costs.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">                                            J U D G E\n\n</p>","numcites":26,"numcitedby":0,"docsource":"Chattisgarh High Court","citetid":1412949,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"balco arbitration","formInput":"balco%20arbitration"},{"value":"indian council of arbitration","formInput":"indian%20council%20of%20arbitration"},{"value":"arbitration clause contract","formInput":"arbitration%20clause%20contract"},{"value":"counter claim ","formInput":"counter%20claim%20"},{"value":"share purchase agreement","formInput":"share%20purchase%20agreement"},{"value":"arbitration clause","formInput":"arbitration%20clause"},{"value":"joint ventures","formInput":"joint%20ventures"},{"value":"balco","formInput":"balco"},{"value":"pma","formInput":"pma"},{"value":"invoking of arbitration","formInput":"invoking%20of%20arbitration"},{"value":"contract arbitration","formInput":"contract%20arbitration"},{"value":"office memorandum","formInput":"office%20memorandum"},{"value":"arbitration agreement and parties","formInput":"arbitration%20agreement%20and%20parties"},{"value":"\"arbitration\"   filter:   \"contract\" \"void-ab-initio\"","formInput":"%22arbitration%22%20%20%20filter%3A%20%20%20%22contract%22%20%22void-ab-initio%22"},{"value":"arbitration agreement","formInput":"arbitration%20agreement"},{"value":"\"disinvestment\"","formInput":"%22disinvestment%22"},{"value":"preliminary objection","formInput":"preliminary%20objection"},{"value":"\"joint venture\"","formInput":"%22joint%20venture%22"},{"value":"arbitration invoked once,can it be invoked again","formInput":"arbitration%20invoked%20once%2Ccan%20it%20be%20invoked%20again"},{"value":"arbitration clauses","formInput":"arbitration%20clauses"}],"cats":[{"value":"citizenship-for-migrants","formInput":"tag:citizenship-for-migrants"},{"value":"arbitration","formInput":"tag:arbitration"},{"value":"equality-before-law","formInput":"tag:equality-before-law"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
