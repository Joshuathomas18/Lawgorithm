Before the writ court, contentions were made by the writ\n\npetitioner that he is awarded with a contract under the Pradhan Manthri\n\nGrama Sadak Yojana (PMGSY) Scheme. The Probable Amount of Contract\n\n(PAC) was Rs.5,41,74,114/-. The petitioner/contractor entered into an\n\nagreement (Exhibit-P1) dated 12.3.2009 with appellant/State. The\n\nagreement included maintenance of the said roads, for a period of 5 years\n\nafter completion of the work. The period of completion was 12 months\n\nfrom the date of agreement, which expired on 11.3.2010. The following\n\nare the works of construction of Rural roads in Elamdesam Block, in Idukki\n\ndistrict:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"> W.A.No.724 of 2016 &amp; W.P.(C)No.21104 of 2019\n                                                       :   7    :\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">            (1) The Vannapuram- Nakkayam road, for the construction of\n            road tarring and other works of the drainage of 3200m length.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">            (2) Devarupara- Naliyani road, having length of 3268m and\n\n            (3) Peringassery-Cheppakulam road having length of 4710 m.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">         5. Instant writ appeal is filed by State of Kerala and others on the\n\nfollowing grounds:\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_2\">         (1)        In       respect           of   the        work       of     the       1st        road,\n         the       petitioner         alleged       that       he   was        prevented         by    the\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">         Forest Authorities but no such obstruction or any such information\n         was received by the Appellate and the petitioner is unnecessarily\n         attributing cause of delay upon the Appellants to avoid his liability\n         and even if it is so the said delay is in respect of the first item of\n         work only and there is no such alleged obstruction in respect of\n         items       2     &amp;     3     road     works.     The      findings      of   the       Learned\n         Single Judge that there is absolute breach of contract on the\n         part of the appellant is against facts and law in this case. The\n         issue raised by the petitioner in the case of work being delayed\n         due to interference by the forest department is only applicable to\n         one road i.e, Vannakkyam -Nakkayam road which is one of the\n         three roads in the package. Even if it is accepted for the sake of\n         the other two roads namely Devappura Njaliyani, and Peringaseery-\n         Cheppakulam were free from such alleged objection from forest\n         department and the petitioner could carry out those works without\n         any hindrance. The petitioner&#x27;s claim that the work was denied due\n         to forest department&#x27;s intervention is not applicable to the above\n         two roads and in respect of the said work there is breach of\n W.A.No.724 of 2016 &amp; W.P.(C)No.21104 of 2019\n                                               :   8   :\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">         contract on his part and hence he is liable for the loss sustained to\n         the State and hence Exhibit P22 is legal and valid and the finding\n         of the Learned of Single Judge that the termination of contract at\n         the risk and cost and of the contractor is not justified is not correct\n         and unsustainable. The learned Single Judge ought to have found\n         that the allegations and the disputes in the W.P.(C) is purely a civil\n         matter to be decided after taking evidence by a competent Civil\n         Court of original jurisdiction and hence the W.(P)(c) is to be\n         dismissed and ought to have directed the petitioner to approach a\n         Civil Court for a decree and the order passed by the Learned Single\n         Judge allowing the claim is without adducing any evidence fact\n         finding and hence the order to set aside Exhibit P22 termination\n         proceedings and the order to pay the disputed amount is also,\n         illegal and not sustainable.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">         (2) Finding of the learned Single Judge in respect of the rate for\n         excavation is also against the facts and law. In the Additional\n         counter affidavit filed by the State, it was specifically contented that\n         taking into account the initial level measurements the part bills\n         have been paid to the petitioner. It was also contended that the\n         blasting work done over and above the quantity of works specified\n         in the contract ought to have been entered into writing for specific\n         requirements as regards the rate. But there was no such written\n         agreement. It was also contented that where variation was required\n         in the work they had to be authorized in writing by the Engineer,\n         without such written directions the petitioner cannot claim the\n         same rate as provided in the Exhibit P1 contract for the extra work\n         done by him. It was also contended that the rates prescribed in\n         the contract for hard rock blasting by mechanical means was only\n W.A.No.724 of 2016 &amp; W.P.(C)No.21104 of 2019\n                                               :   9   :\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">         an inadvertent clerical mistake and the same is corrected also and\n         hence the petitioner cannot claim the same rate as prescribed in\n         the agreement. It is also submitted that rate shown in the\n         agreement is Rs.584.71m3 for excavation for road way in hard rock.\n         And it was alleged by the petitioner that he has excavated\n         additional rock quantity of 15665.24 m3 for two roads. It is\n         submitted that since no permission in writing had been issued by\n         the engineer the said work is not authorised and the same can be\n         paid only at a lesser rate. But without considering these aspects\n         the finding of the Learned Single Judge to the effect that the\n         petitioner is entitled to get the contract rate for the additional work\n         alleged to be done is illegal and hence is not sustainable.\n         (3) Finding of the learned Single Judge to the effect that\n         no effort to arrive at a decision in the matter by any independent\n         adjudication has been taken by the official respondents is\n         illegal and against facts and law.

In spite\nof all these problems we have been going ahead with the work in two sites, but\ndue to the continuous heavy rains recently. We were forced to stop the work\ntemporarily.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">Site was handed over to us without carrying out the basic actions needed from\nthe department prior to handing over the site.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">Peringassery - Cheppukulam Road\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">1. As soon as we started the work objections came from various local residents\nin acquiring their portion of land. Most of them own small extend of land with\nwhich is their livelihood. With great difficulties and by spending lot of money and\ntime we managed somehow to resolve these issues. It was the basic\nresponsibility of the department to ensure that all such disputes with the local\npeople are sorted out before handing over the site and free surrender of land is\nprovided to us.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">2. Utilities like KSEB, KWA passing through the areas of the proposed road were\nnot shifted which also was the responsibility of the department prior to handing\nover the site. Even the sanctions from the concerned departments are not\nobtained by KSRRDA authorities so far. As a result we lost many man days and\nspent substantial amounts to go ahead with the work.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">3.

Sanction form the Forest Department was needed here since the road passes\nthrough Forest Area and this is the primary responsibility of KSRRDA authorities\nhas not done anything in this regard. As a gesture of goodwill and in the interest\nof a public matte we approached various offices of the Forest Department up to\nthe Joint Conservator of Forest several times and managed to obtain sanction in\nsome provisional manner and proceeded with the work.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">2. As we were progressing with the work, during heavy rains land slide occurred\nin the vertical sides of the road extending to 15 mtr. Height. We regret to note\nthat although we intimated this in time, this area is not measured by the\ndepartment nor they communicated any directions in this regard to us so far and\nhence this work could not be completed. You will agree that this is not in the\nscope of our work at all.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">Vannappuram - Nakkayam Road\n\nWork could not be started in this road due to no fault of us. On the day one\nwhen we started the work there the Forest Department officials stopped us from\nproceedings with the work due to want of prior sanction from them. A letter\ndated 28.12.2009 form DFO, Kothamangalam in this regard is enclosed in which\nthere is a clear mention of the need of prior sanction from them. It is need less\nto mention that this is yet another instance of the lapse of KSRRDA authorities.\nBesides all the above, we were asked to execute some extra excavation of\nroadway in hard rock for proper completion of the work in the first two sites and\nunder full trust of the department we started executing the work. But it was\nshocking to us when we were asked to sign a supplementary agreement for the\nextra work wherein the rate for the extra work was slashed by approximately\nRs.200/ per m3 from the rate as per the original agreement which would result\nin a loss of approximately Rs.35 lakhs to us. We represented this matter and\nrequested to reinstate the original rate for the extra work also but there is no\nresponse to this from the department so far.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_51\">You will agree that the delay in the work was due to no fault of us, and on the\nother hand the department is wholly responsible for this.

We have\nbeen executing the work in such a way that there was not much time laps in\nspite of all these problems. Work had to be stopped temporarily only after setting\nup of last monsoon due to heavy rains in that area which was continuing even\nafter monsoon.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">While the work was progressing we were instructed to carry out certain extra\nitems of work in both the sites for the proper completion of the work amounting\nto Rs.61.56 lacks. Under full trust of our principles we started executing the extra\nitems of work also.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">Meanwhile we were asked to execute a Supplemental Agreement for the extra\nitems of work. But we were surprised to see that the rate applied for one of the\nextra items of work in the Supplemental Agreement was very much reduced form\nthat for the same work as per the Original Agreement Schedule for no reasons.\nThe quantity and rate in the two schedule differ as mentioned below.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">Name of the work:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">&quot;Excavation for Roadway in Hard Rock (blasting prohibited) including break rock,\nloading in tippers and disposal with a lift up to 1.5 mtr and lead up to 1,000 mtr,\ntrimming bottom and slide slopes in accordance with requirements of lines,\ngrades and Cross-Sections as per technical specification clauses 302.3.5.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">As per Original Agreement Schedule\n\nPeringassery Cheppukulam -                         1,582 m3 (Item No.5)\nDevarupara - Naliyani      -                       5,274 m3 (Item No.5)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">                                                   -----------\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">                                                   6,856 m3\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_64\">                                                   -------------------\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\"> W.A.No.724 of 2016 &amp; W.P.(C)No.21104 of 2019\n                                                       :   40   :\n</p>\n\n\n\n<pre id=\"pre_5\">Rate per m3                                    -           Rs. 584.71\n\n\nAs per Supplemental Agreement Schedule\n\nPeringassery - Cheppukulam -                               10,779.24 m3 (Item No.3)\nDevarupara - Naliyani        -                               4,940      m3 (Item No.1)\n                                                            ----------------\n                                                            15,719.24 m3\n                                                           ----------------------------\n\n\n\nRate per m3                                        -\n                                                           Rs.357.90\n\nRate reduced by                                    -       Rs.226.81 per m3\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">In the Supplemental Agreement Schedule the work is specified as &#x27;by mechanical\nmeans&#x27; but the fact is that the work as per the Original Agreement Schedule was\nalso done by mechanical means only.

The initial levels. of the Vannappuram-Nakkayam road\n                 are taken and level calculations are made Respondent\n                 personnel as evidenced by the initial level documents.\n                 II.

The rate of Rs. 584.71/m3 shown in the original\n                 agreement No,129/SE-KSRRDA/2007-2008 dated: 12-03-2609\n                 for the item &quot;Excavation for roadway in hard rock(blasting\n                 prohibited) with rock breakers including breaking rock, loading\n                 in tippers and disposal with a lift upto 1.5m and lead upto\n                 1000 metres, trimming bottom and side slopes in accordance\n                 with requirements of lines, grades and cross- sections as pet\n                 Technical Specification Clause 302.3.5&quot; is very high and it\n                 seems that there occurred mistake in arriving at the rate. The\n                 basis for arriving at the rate for an item of work included in the\n                 Schedule of Woks is &#x27;he Standard Data Book for Analysis of\n                 Rates for Rural Roads. as per Technical Specification Clause\n                 302.3.5. Excavation in hard rock (blasting Prohibited) can be\n                 done in two ways by manual means and by mechanical means.\n                 In manual means simple chiseller is being used. But the\n                 manual labour involvement will be more and the rate of out\n                 put will be very low. In the mechanical means , hydraulic\n                 excavator 0.9 cum with rock breaker attachment, is being\n                 used. In this case manual labour involvement will be less and\n                 rate of out put will be more. In the present case the hard rock\n                 to be excavated is of large quantity and hence excavation is\n                 possible only by mechanical means. In fact the specification of\n                 this item in the Schedule of work insists the use of rock\n                 breakers. Hence the rate in the agreement should have been\n                 for doing the work mechanically. But by mistake the rate\n                 shown is for doing the work manually. for doing the work by\n                 manual means the rate works out to Rs. 584.71/m3 whereas\n                 for mechanical means it will be Rs.387.90/m3. More over,\n                 excavation of the hard rock in these roads is not possible and\n                 advisable for the following reasons:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_171\"> W.A.No.724 of 2016 &amp; W.P.(C)No.21104 of 2019\n                                               :   45   :\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_172\">               a.

The total quantity\n          of this item to be done, as per the Revised Estimate is 22521.24\n          M3, against the original 8384 M3. The same mistake has crept in\n          with the other contract agreements that contain this item of work\n          under the Programme implementation Unit, Idukki. All the\n          contractors, except the Appellant, have agreed to carryout the\n          excess quantities of this item or work, where ever such excess have\n          occurred, at Rs 357.90/M3 after entering into necessary\n          supplemental agreements, The Respondent has admitted claims for\n          this item of work at the higher rate of Rs. 584.71/m3 for the\n          quantities specified in the original agreement Schedule; ie, for a\n          total quantity of 8384 m3.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_177\">          iv.

The prerogative remedy of mandamus has long provided\n         the normal means of enforcing the performance of public duties by\n         public authorities of all kinds. The essence of mandamus is that it is\n         a command, ordering the performance of a public legal duty. It is a\n         discretionary remedy and the court has got full discretion to\n         withhold it in unsuitable cases. Originally, writ of mandamus was\n         merely an administrative order from the sovereign to his\n         subordinates. According to Wade and Forsyth on Administrative\n         Law, Seventh Edition at page 647, &quot;Today the majority of\n         applications for mandamus are &quot;made at the instance of private\n         litigants complaining of some breach of duty by some public\n         authority. . . .Within the ﬁeld of public law the scope of mandamus\n         is still wide and the court may use it freely to prevent breach of\n         duty and injustice&quot;. Regarding the contractual obligation, the\n         learned Author at &quot;page 650, state as follows: &quot;A distinction which\n         needs to be clarified is that between public duties enforceable by\n         mandamus, which are usually statutory, and duties arising merely\n         from contract. Contractual duties are enforceable as matters of\n         private law by the ordinary contractual remedies, such as damages,\n         injunction, speciﬁc performance and declaration. They are not\n         enforceable by mandamus, which in the ﬁrst place is conﬁned to\n         public duties and secondly is not granted where&#x27; there are other\n         adequate remedies&quot;.

The chief function of the writ is to compel the\n         performance of public duties prescribed by statute and to keep the\n         subordinate tribunals and oflicers exercising public functions within\n         the limits of their jurisdiction. In the present case, the appointment\n         of the appellant as a Manager by the custodian by virtue of his\n         power under section 10(2) of the L950 Act is contractual in its\n         nature and there is no statutory obligation as between him and the\n         appellant. In our opinion, any duty or obligation falling upon a\n         public servant out of a contract entered into by him as such public\n         servant cannot be enforced by the machinery of a writ under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_8\">Article\n         226</a> of the Constitution. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1900683\" id=\"span_6\">Their Lordships referred to the observation\n         of the Privy Council in <a href=\"/doc/1900683/\" id=\"a_9\">Commissioner of Income Tax, Bombay\n         Presidency and Aden v.

The\n         question in issue in <a href=\"/doc/1261492/\" id=\"a_25\">Vidyarthi</a>&#x27;s case was with regard to the\n         termination of Government Pleaders by the Government.              The\n         Government defence was purely a matter of contract and with no\n         public element attaching to it which may be terminated at any time\n         at the sweet will of the Government excluding judicial review. The\n         Supreme Court indicated the presence of public element attached\n         to the office or post of District Government Counsel of every\n         category covered by the impugned order and that is sufficient to\n         attract <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_26\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution and bring the question of\n         validity of the impugned circular within the scope of judicial review.\n         Hence, there the question was whether the termination of the\n         Government Pleaders was proper or not.</span> In the L I.C.&#x27;s Case, the\n         question in issue was regarding the &quot;terms of the contract entered\n W.A.No.724 of 2016 &amp; W.P.(C)No.21104 of 2019\n                                               :   66   :\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_235\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1238017\" id=\"span_14\">into by the L.I.C. with the citizen. According to the Supreme\n         Court,the terms and conditions prescribed therein involve public\n         element.          While L.I.C. is entitled to evolve policies on business\n         principles, it cannot restrict a police to a class of persons only\n         thereby denying others its beneﬁts. The court held that the policy\n         cannot be restricted only to salaried persons in Government, quasi\n         Government or reputed commercial ﬁrms. Such condition in Table\n         58 declared unconstitutional. Learned counsel for the respondents\n         also relied on the decision in <a href=\"/doc/1238017/\" id=\"a_27\">Mahabir Auto Stores v.

State of Uttar Pradesh</a> (supra) was a\n         case of mass termination of District Government counsel in the\n         State of U.P. It was a case of termination from a post involving\n         public element. It was a case of non-Government servant holding a\n         public office, on account of which it was held to be a matter within\n         the public law ﬁeld. This decision too does not afﬁrm the principle\n         now canvassed by the learned counsel. We are, therefore, of the\n         opinion that in case of contracts freely entered into with the State,\n         like the present ones, there is no room for invoking the doctrine of\n         fairness and reasonableness against one party to the contract\n         (State) -for the purpose of altering or adding to the terms and\n         conditions of the contract, merely because it happens to be the\n         State.

Indian Oil Corporation</a> [(A.I.R.) 1990 S.C.\n         1031]. But that case turned on its peculiar facts. All that was done\n         was to advise the I.O.C. to take the appellant into confidence\n         before putting an end to his long enjoyed right. The observations in\n         the judgment are conﬁned to the particular facts of that case. It is\n         significant to note &quot;that it was not a case where the rights of the\n         parties were governed by a contract. This decision cannot,\n         therefore, support the contention of the respondents&quot;.</span>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_97\">         14. Here, so far as our case is concerned, there is no case that\n         some persons were given payment under the bills, while the others\n         were being discriminated. The entire case is that in spite of the\n         completion of the contractual work and in spite of the fact that M\n         books were presented and were approved, payments were not\n         made. The question in issue is whether the Government can be\n         compelled to pay the amount by issuing a writ -of mandamus.\n         Learned counsel for the respondents brought to our notice the\n         elaborate provisions made in the P.W.D. Manual and Financial Code\n         and has stated that in the Manual and Code, provisions are made\n         for awarding of the contract and apportionment of the amount for a\n         particular contract and also stipulates that payment should be made\n         as soon as the bills are presented. According to them, provisions of\n         the Manual and Financial Code give sufficient indication that the\n         Government has to act as per the provisions in the Manual and\n         Code and when they omitted to act on the basis of the Manual or\n W.A.No.724 of 2016 &amp; W.P.(C)No.21104 of 2019\n                                               :   68   :\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_239\">         Code, a right is given to the contractor to approach this Court to\n         perform the duty cast on the P.W.D. Manual or Financial Code.\n         According to us, this argument cannot be accepted. It is true that\n         the P.W.D. Manual gives details regarding the awarding of contracts,\n         payment of amounts, etc. So also the Financial Code gives the\n         details of allotment of money to each contract work. According to\n         us, the Financial Code and the P.W.D. Manual are only instructions\n         for the Government. That does not mean that the Government can\n         violate the provisions of the Code or Manual. They cannot be said\n         to be statutory rules or statutory duties. The Government being\n         engaged in large number of activities, it has to control its officers\n         by providing certain Rules and Regulations while performing their\n         duties. So tar as the rights and obligations of the parties are\n         concerned, &#x27;what we have to look into is only the provisions of the\n         contract.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_98\">         15. As already stated, in all these cases, there is no statutory\n         contract. Conditions in the contract provide for everything including\n         for payment under the contract and also for termination of the\n         contract, recovery of damages, etc. Thus essentially when the\n         contractor moves this Court for payment of dues under the\n         contract, this Court has to enforce the provisions of the contract\n         and not the provisions of the statute or public duty. Learned\n         counsel then contended that in all these contractual works, what is\n         involved is the construction of roads, bridges, dams, etc. Hence, the\n         argument is, what is involved in these cases is the involvement of\n         public duty and in that aspect, it cannot be said that they have no\n         right to approach this Court. According to us, this argument is also\n W.A.No.724 of 2016 &amp; W.P.(C)No.21104 of 2019\n                                               :   69   :\n</p>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_240\">         without any substance. Here what is being done is not the\n         enforcement of public duty. May be what is involved in the contract\n         is for the Welfare of the public. But the right to be enforced is for\n         the reimbursement of the amount spent by the contractors for the\n         purpose of contract. We cannot say that they were exercising public\n         duty in so tar as there is no statutory contract. Hence, according to\n         us, it is a case where a writ of mandamus cannot be issued.\n         Learned counsel then argued that they have got no efficacious\n         alternate remedy and that if they approach the Civil Court, the\n         proceedings will be pending for a long time. We do not approve this\n         argument. In cases where the State does not contest or admit the\n         claims made by the plaintiff, the Civil Court can immediately pass\n         the decree on the basis of the admission made by the State and in\n         case only a portion of the claim is admitted, for that portion, an\n         interim decree can be passed.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_241\">         l6. Thus, we are of the view that Original Petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_33\">Article 226</a>\n         of the Constitution for a writ of mandamus for enforcement of the\n         contractual obligation, viz. payment of amount to the contractors in\n         a contract, which is non-statutory, cannot be enforced through\n         <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_34\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. The petitioners have to approach\n         the Civil Court for enforcement of the contractual obligations. We\n         hold that <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_35\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution cannot be invoked for\n         enforcement of the contractual obligations in such cases. We are of\n         the view that in so far as the Original Petitions which have been.\n         decided till today on the basis of the admission made by the State,\n         this decision not have any effect on those decisions. This Judgment\n         will affect only those cases pending already in which no decision is\n W.A.No.724 of 2016 &amp; W.P.(C)No.21104 of 2019\n                                               :   70   :\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_242\">         taken by the Court and the Writ Petitions hereinafter ﬁled.

We grant time for payment by another four\n         months from today. The learned Additional Advocate General\n         submitted that this Court was not correct in ordering interest on the\n         amount and contended that the contract does not&#x27; provide for\n         payment of interest. In all these cases, we find that this Court has\n         ﬁxed a time 1imit,; within which if the amount is not paid, interest\n         has to be paid.
