The   Bench   in  Boghara   Polyfab   Private   Limited1    in \n\n\nparagraphs 42 and 43 (page 291), with reference to the cases cited \n\n\nbefore it, inter alia, noted that there were two categories of the cited \n\n\ncases;  (one)  where the Court after considering the facts found that \n\n\nthere   was   a   full   and   final   settlement   resulting   in   accord   and \n\n\nsatisfaction,   and   there   was   no   substance   in   the   allegations   of \n\n\ncoercion/undue   influence  and,  consequently, it   was  held  that   there \n\n\ncould be no reference of any dispute to arbitration and (two) where \n\n\nthe court  found some substance in the contention of the claimants \n\n\nthat `no dues/claim certificates&#x27; or  `full and final settlement discharge \n\n\nvouchers&#x27;   were   insisted   and   taken   (either   in   printed   format   or \n\n\notherwise) as a condition precedent for release of the admitted dues \n\n\nand thereby giving rise to an arbitrable dispute.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">21.           In  Boghara Polyfab Private Limited1,   the consequences \n\n\nof discharge of the contract were also considered.  In para 25 (page \n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">284),   it   was   explained   that   when   a   contract   has   been   fully \n\n\nperformed, then there is a discharge of the contract by performance \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                                                                      10</span>\n\n\f\nand   the   contract   comes   to   an   end   and   in   regard   to   such   a \n\n\ndischarged   contract,   nothing   remains   and   there   cannot   be   any \n\n\ndispute and, consequently,  there cannot be reference to arbitration \n\n\nof   any   dispute   arising   from   a   discharged   contract.   It   was  held   that \n\n\nthe   question   whether   the   contract   has   been   discharged   by \n\n\nperformance or not is a mixed question of fact and law, and if there \n\n\nis   a   dispute   in   regard   to   that   question,   such   question   is   arbitrable. \n\n\nThe   Court,   however,   noted   an   exception     to   this   proposition.   The \n\n\nexception   noticed   is   that     where   both   the   parties   to   a   contract \n\n\nconfirm   in   writing   that   the   contract   has   been   fully   and   finally \n\n\ndischarged   by   performance   of   all   obligations   and   there   are   no \n\n\noutstanding claims or disputes, courts will not refer any subsequent \n\n\nclaim or dispute to arbitration.   Yet another exception noted therein \n\n\nis with regard to those cases where one of the parties to the contract \n\n\nissues a full and final discharge voucher (or no-dues certificate, as \n\n\nthe case may be) confirming that he has received the payment in full \n\n\nand final satisfaction of all claims, and he has no outstanding claim. \n\n\nIt was observed that issuance of full and final discharge voucher or \n\n\nno-dues certificate of that kind amounts to discharge of the contract \n\n\nby acceptance or performance and the party issuing the discharge \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                                                         11</span>\n\n\f\nvoucher/certificate cannot thereafter make any fresh claim or revive \n\n\nany settled claim nor can it seek reference to arbitration in respect of \n\n\nany claim. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_41\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">22.            In paragraph 26 (pages 284-285),  this Court in Boghara  \n\n\nPolyfab Private Limited1  held that if a party which has executed the \n\n\ndischarge   agreement   or   discharge   voucher,   alleges   that   the \n\n\nexecution       of   such   document   was                     on      account   of \n\n\nfraud/coercion/undue   influence   practised   by   the   other   party,   and   if \n\n\nthat   party   establishes   the   same,   then   such   discharge   voucher   or \n\n\nagreement   is   rendered   void   and   cannot   be   acted   upon   and \n\n\nconsequently, any dispute raised by such party would be arbitrable. \n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">23.            In paragraph 24 (page 284) in   Boghara Polyfab Private  \n\n\nLimited1,   this   Court   held     that   a   claim   for   arbitration   cannot   be \n\n\nrejected merely or solely on the ground that a settlement agreement \n\n\nor discharge voucher has been executed by the claimant.  The Court \n\n\nstated   that   such   dispute   will   have   to   be   decided   by   the   Chief \n\n\nJustice/his   designate   in   the   proceedings   under   <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_19\">Section   11</a>   of   the \n\n\n1996 Act or by the Arbitral Tribunal. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">24.            In our opinion, there is no rule of the absolute kind.  In a \n\n\ncase   where   the   claimant   contends   that   a     discharge   voucher   or \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                                                                     12</span>\n\n\f\nno-claim certificate has been obtained by fraud, coercion, duress or \n\n\nundue influence and the other side contests the correctness thereof, \n\n\nthe Chief Justice/his designate must look into this aspect to find out \n\n\nat   least,   prima   facie,   whether   or   not   the   dispute   is   bona   fide   and \n\n\ngenuine.   Where   the   dispute   raised   by   the   claimant   with   regard   to \n\n\nvalidity of the discharge voucher or no-claim certificate or settlement \n\n\nagreement,   prima   facie,   appears   to   be   lacking   in   credibility,   there \n\n\nmay   not   be   necessity   to   refer   the   dispute   for   arbitration   at   all.     It \n\n\ncannot   be   overlooked     that   the   cost   of   arbitration   is   quite   huge   - \n\n\nmost   of   the   time,   it   runs   in   six   and   seven     figures.   It   may   not   be \n\n\nproper   to   burden   a   party,   who   contends   that   the   dispute   is   not \n\n\narbitrable   on   account   of   discharge   of   contract,     with   huge   cost   of \n\n\narbitration merely because plea of fraud,  coercion, duress or undue \n\n\ninfluence   has   been   taken   by   the   claimant.   A   bald   plea   of   fraud, \n\n\ncoercion, duress or undue influence is not enough and the party who \n\n\nsets   up   such   plea   must   prima   facie   establish   the   same   by  placing \n\n\nmaterial   before   the   Chief   Justice/his   designate.     If   the   Chief \n\n\nJustice/his   designate   finds   some   merit   in   the   allegation   of   fraud, \n\n\ncoercion,   duress   or   undue   influence,   he   may   decide   the   same   or \n\n\nleave it to be decided by the Arbitral Tribunal.  On the other hand, if \n\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                                                                                             13</span>\n\n\f\nsuch plea is found to be an after-thought, make-believe or lacking in \n\n\ncredibility, the matter must be set at rest then and there.  \n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_46\">25.           In light of the above legal position, we now   turn to the \n\n\nfacts of the present case. \n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_47\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">26.           At the time of receiving payment on account of final bill, \n\n\nthe contractor executed the certificate in the following terms :\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">       &quot;a)    I/we hereby certify that I/we have performed the work \n\n              under   the   condition   of   the   contract   agreement   No. \n\n              CEBTZ-14/95-96,   for   which   payment   is   claimed   and \n\n              that  I/we   have   no   further   claims   under   CA   No. \n\n              CEBTZ-14/95-96.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">       b)     Received   rupees   two   lakhs   fifteen   thousand     one \n\n              hundred   seventy   eight   only.

The contractor also appended  the following certificate:\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">       &quot;It is certified that I have prepared this final bill for claiming \n\n       entire   payment   due   to   me   from   this   contract   agreement. \n\n       The final bill includes all claims raised by me from time to \n\n       time   irrespective   of   the   fact   whether   they   are \n\n       admitted/accepted   by   the   department   or   not.   I   now \n\n       categorically certify that I have no more claim in respect of \n\n       this contract beyond those already included in this final bill \n\n       by me and the amount so claimed by me shall be in full and \n\n       final   satisfaction   of   all   my   claims   under   this   contract \n\n       agreement. I shall however, receive my right to raise claim \n\n       to the extent disallowed to me from this final bill.&quot; \n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\">28.           The   above   certificates   leave   no   manner   of   doubt   that \n\n\nupon receipt of the payment,  there has been full and final settlement \n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                                                                     14</span>\n\n\f\nof   the   contractor&#x27;s   claim   under   the   contract.     That   the   payment   of \n\n\nfinal   bill   was   made   to   the   contractor   on   June   19,   2000   is   not   in \n\n\ndispute.     After   receipt   of   the   payment   on   June   19,   2000,     no \n\n\ngrievance was raised or lodged by the contractor immediately. The \n\n\nconcerned authority, thereafter, released the bank guarantee in the \n\n\nsum of Rs. 21,00,000/- on July 12, 2000.   It was then that on that \n\n\nday itself, the  contractor lodged further claims. \n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_52\">29.             The present, in our opinion, appears to be a case falling \n\n\nin the category of exception noted in the case of  Boghara Polyfab  \n\n\nPrivate   Limited    (Para   25,   page   284).       As   to   financial   duress   or \n\n\ncoercion,   nothing   of   this   kind   is   established   prima   facie.     Mere \n\n\nallegation   that     no-claim   certificates   have   been   obtained   under \n\n\nfinancial duress and coercion, without there being anything more to \n\n\nsuggest that,  does not lead to an arbitrable dispute. \n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">30.             The   conduct   of   the   contractor   clearly   shows   that   `no \n\n\nclaim   certificates&#x27;   were   given   by   it     voluntarily;   the   contractor \n\n\naccepted   the   amount   voluntarily   and   the   contract   was     discharged \n\n\nvoluntarily.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_54\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">31.
