Mr.    Amit     Kumar     Das,   learned    counsel     for   the\n\npetitioner/applicant has raised serious objection to the aforesaid\n\nsubmission by taking the ground that once the Arbitrator has\n\nbeen appointed by this Court in view of the provision of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_20\">Section\n\n11(6)</a> of the Act, 1996 and if the mandate of arbitrator is being\n\nterminated due to death of sole Arbitrator, in that circumstances,\n\nthere is no requirement to again follow the rules, as provided in\n\nthe Arbitration Clause, rather, the application is straightaway to\n\nbe filed before this Court invoking the jurisdiction conferred\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_21\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, 1996 and as such, it is a fit case\n\nwhere substitute Arbitrator may be appointed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_33\">7.

This Court, therefore, is required to answer the issue, i.e.,\n\n      &quot;As to whether on the death of sole Arbitrator in course of\n\npendency    of   the   arbitration   proceeding,    the   subsequent\n\napplication under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_23\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, 1996 is straightaway\n\nmaintainable before this Court or not?&quot;\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">      &quot;Or the petitioner/applicant is required to follow the\n\nmandate of agreement which was followed at the time of\n\nappointment of Arbitrator at the initial stage?&quot;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_36\">10.

Herein in the instant case, the dispute in between the\n\nparties has arisen which led the petitioner/applicant to invoke\n\nthe Arbitration Clause when the alternative mechanism of\n\nresolution of dispute as provided under Clause 2.6 of the PPA\n\nhas not been arrived at and in that circumstances, an application\n\nhas been filed before this Court by taking recourse of the\n\nprovision of Section 11(6) for appointment of Arbitrator being\n\nArbitration Application No.05 of 2016.An appropriate order was\n\npassed in the aforesaid Arbitration Application on 07.04.2017, by\n\nwhich, Hon&#x27;ble Mr. Justice S.B.

Parties had appeared\n\nand filed their respective pleadings but unfortunately, the sole\n\nArbitrator died. As such, the arbitration proceeding which had\n\nbeen initiated by appointment of Arbitrator by virtue of order\n\ndated 07.04.2017 passed in Arbitration Application No.05 of 2016\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                           13</span>\n\n\nremains inconclusive and in that view of the matter, the mandate\n\nof an arbitrator has been terminated which has occasioned the\n\npetitioner/applicant to file instant application for appointment of\n\nan arbitrator in view of the provision as provided under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_38\">Section\n\n15(2)</a> of the Act, 1996.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">      <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 15(2)</a> of the Act provides that where the mandate of\n\nan arbitrator terminates, a substitute arbitrator shall be appointed\n\naccording to the rules that were applicable to the appointment of\n\nan arbitrator being replaced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_50\">13.   Mr. Rohitashya Roy, learned counsel appearing for the\n\nrespondent has raised serious objection by raising the issue of\n\nmaintainability by taking aid of the provision as contained under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_40\">Section 15(2)</a> of the Act, 1996, where according to him, the\n\nprovision has been made that a substitute arbitrator shall be\n\nappointed according to the rules that were applicable to the\n\nappointment of arbitrator being replaced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_51\">      It has been submitted by him that as per the aforesaid\n\nstatutory provision even for appointment of substitute arbitrator,\n\nthe same is only to be appointed as per the rules which were\n\napplicable to the appointment of arbitrator being replaced,\n\nmeaning thereby, as per the condition, stipulation under the\n\ncontract as provided under Clause 2.6 of the agreement, wherein,\n\nit has been agreed between the parties that a request is to be\n\nmade first by the petitioner/applicant for appointment of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">                           14</span>\n\n\narbitrator before the respondent and only in case of failure on the\n\npart of the respondent, then only second application under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, 1996 is maintainable, but, the\n\npetitioner/applicant since has not made any request for\n\nappointment of substitute arbitrator, rather, straightaway filed\n\ninstant application under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, 1996, therefore,\n\nit is not maintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">14.

This Court has considered the judgments rendered by the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1997730/\" id=\"a_43\">Yashwith Constructions (P) Ltd.</a> (supra)\n\nand has found therefrom the factual aspects that on a dispute\n\nhaving arisen, the Managing Director of the respondent\n\nCompany appointed an arbitrator in terms of the arbitration\n\nclause. The     arbitrator     resigned.   The   Managing Director,\n\nthereupon, in view of the mandate of the arbitration agreement\n\nappointed another arbitrator. At that stage, the petitioner\n\napproached the Chief Justice of the High Court under Section 11\n\nsub-section (5) read with <a href=\"/doc/1937086/\" id=\"a_44\">Section 15(2)</a> of the Arbitration and\n\nConciliation Act, 1996, praying that the Chief Justice may appoint\n\nsubstitute arbitrator to resolve the disputes between the parties.\n\nThe Chief Justice found that the appointment of the second\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                         15</span>\n\n\narbitrator by the Managing Director, after the resignation of the\n\nfirst arbitrator, was valid in law since it was permissible under\n\nthe contract and the right to make such an appointment was\n\nsaved by <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 15(2)</a> of the Act.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">     The argument which was advanced before the High Court\n\nthat under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 15(2)</a> of the Act referred to the statutory rules\n\nproviding for appointment of arbitrators and not to a contractual\n\nprovision for such appointment was rejected by the learned Chief\n\nJustice of the High Court by holding no occasion to appoint an\n\narbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act in the case. Thus, the\n\napplication was dismissed, leaving the parties to pursue their\n\nclaims before the arbitrator appointed by the Managing Director\n\nin terms of the arbitration agreement between the parties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_55\">     The aforesaid decision was challenged by way of a writ\n\npetition in the High Court. The Division Bench noticed the\n\ndecision of this Court in the case of SBP &amp; Co. Vs. Patel Engg.\n\nLtd., (supra) by holding that the order passed by the Chief Justice\n\nis a judicial order and no writ petition would lie in the High\n\nCourt challenging such an order and only an appeal could be\n\nfiled in the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court invoking <a href=\"/doc/427855/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 136</a> of the\n\nConstitution of India. But the Division Bench thought that since\n\nthat decision saved appointments made on or before the date that\n\ndecision was rendered by this Court, the writ petition filed by the\n\npetitioner would also be saved and the writ petition could be\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                         16</span>\n\n\ndecided on merits, thereby the issue decided on merit by holding\n\nthat the learned Chief Justice was right in rejecting the\n\napplication made by the petitioner and thus, the writ petition was\n\ndismissed which was challenged before the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">     The Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court has came to the conclusive finding\n\nby affirming the view taken by the learned Chief Justice and the\n\nDivision Bench by making an observation that when the\n\narbitrator originally appointed in terms of the arbitration\n\nagreement withdrew for health reasons, the Managing Director,\n\nas authorized originally by the arbitration agreement, promptly\n\nappointed a substitute arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_57\">     It has further been observed that even in the arbitration\n\nagreement, there is no specific provision authorizing the\n\nManaging Director to appoint a substitute arbitrator if the\n\noriginal appointment terminates or if the originally appointed\n\narbitrator withdraws from the arbitration. But, this so-called\n\nomission in the arbitration agreement is made up by the specific\n\nprovision contained in <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 15(2)</a> of the Act. The withdrawal\n\nof an arbitrator from the office for any reason is within the\n\npurview of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 15(1)(a)</a> of the Act. Obviously, therefore,\n\nSection 15(2) would be attracted and a substitute arbitrator has to\n\nbe appointed according to the rules that are applicable for the\n\nappointment of the arbitrator to be replaced. It has been held\n\ntherein that the term &quot;rules&quot; in Section 15(2) obviously referred to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_27\">                          17</span>\n\n\nthe provision for appointment contained in the arbitration\n\nagreement or any rules of any institution under which the\n\ndisputes were referred to arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\">     <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act has application only when a party\n\nor the person concerned had failed to act in terms of the\n\narbitration agreement. When Section 15(2) says that a substitute\n\narbitrator can be appointed according to the rules that were\n\napplicable for the appointment of the arbitrator originally, it is\n\nnot confined to an appointment under any statutory rule or rule\n\nframed under the Act or under the scheme. It only means that the\n\nappointment of the substitute arbitrator must be done according\n\nto the original agreement or provision applicable to the\n\nappointment of the arbitrator at the initial stage and thereby the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court was not agreed with the contrary view taken\n\nby some of the High Courts. Thereafter, it has been observed in\n\nthe order that since the power of the Managing Director of the\n\nrespondent is saved by <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 15(2)</a> of the Act and he has\n\nexercised the power in terms of the arbitration agreement, as\n\nsuch, no infirmity either in the decision of the learned Chief\n\nJustice or in that of the Division Bench has been found therein,\n\nfor ready reference, the relevant paragraphs, i.e., paragraph nos.\n\n4 &amp; 5 are required to be referred as under:-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">         &quot;4. In our view, the learned Chief Justice and the\n         Division Bench have rightly understood the scope of\n         <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 15</a> of the Act. When the arbitrator originally\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                   18</span>\n\n\nappointed in terms of the arbitration agreement\nwithdrew for health reasons, the Managing Director,\nas   authorised    originally      by     the       arbitration\nagreement,    promptly     appointed           a     substitute\narbitrator. It is true that in the arbitration\nagreement there is no specific provision authorising\nthe Managing Director to appoint a substitute\narbitrator if the original appointment terminates or\nif the originally appointed arbitrator withdraws from\nthe arbitration. But, this so-called omission in the\narbitration agreement is made up by the specific\nprovision contained in <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 15(2)</a> of the Act. The\nwithdrawal of an arbitrator from the office for any\nreason is within the purview of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 15(1)(a)</a> of\nthe Act. Obviously, therefore, Section 15(2) would\nbe attracted and a substitute arbitrator has to be\nappointed according to the rules that are applicable\nfor the appointment of the arbitrator to be replaced.\nTherefore, what Section 15(2) contemplates is an\nappointment of the substituted arbitrator or the\nreplacing of the arbitrator by another according to\nthe rules that were applicable to the appointment of\nthe original arbitrator who was being replaced. The\nterm &quot;rules&quot; in Section 15(2) obviously referred to\nthe provision for appointment contained in the\narbitration agreement or any rules of any institution\nunder   which     the   disputes        were       referred   to\narbitration. There was no failure on the part of the\nparty concerned as per the arbitration agreement, to\nfulfil his obligation in terms of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 11</a> of the Act\nso as to attract the jurisdiction of the Chief Justice\nunder <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_57\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act for appointing a\nsubstitute arbitrator. Obviously, Section 11(6) of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                            19</span>\n\n\n        Act has application only when a party or the person\n        concerned had failed to act in terms of the\n        arbitration agreement. When Section 15(2) says that\n        a substitute arbitrator can be appointed according to\n        the rules that were applicable for the appointment of\n        the arbitrator originally, it is not confined to an\n        appointment under any statutory rule or rule\n        framed under the Act or under the scheme. It only\n        means that the appointment of the substitute\n        arbitrator must be done according to the original\n        agreement     or        provision   applicable   to   the\n        appointment of the arbitrator at the initial stage. We\n        are not in a position to agree with the contrary view\n        taken by some of the High Courts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">        5. Since here, the power of the Managing Director of\n        the respondent is saved by <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_58\">Section 15(2)</a> of the Act\n        and he has exercised that power on the terms of the\n        arbitration agreement, we see no infirmity either in\n        the decision of the learned Chief Justice or in that of\n        the Division Bench. We do not think it necessary in\n        this case to go into the question whether the writ\n        petition before the High Court was maintainable on\n        the basis that it challenged an order of the Chief\n        Justice rendered on 4-3-2005, prior to the date of the\n        decision in SBP &amp; Co. v.

The arbitrator resigned. The Managing\n\nDirector, thereupon, in view of the mandate in the arbitration\n\nagreement promptly appointed another arbitrator. At that stage,\n\nthe petitioner approached the Chief Justice of the High Court\n\nunder Section 11 sub-section (5) read with <a href=\"/doc/1937086/\" id=\"a_119\">Section 15(2)</a> of the\n\nArbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996, praying that the Chief\n\nJustice may appoint a substitute arbitrator to resolve the disputes\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                         38</span>\n\n\nbetween the parties.

Unless respondent 2 failed to exercise\n\nits jurisdiction, the High Court could not assume jurisdiction\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_123\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_88\">      Such finding has been arrived at on the basis of the\n\ncondition of contract, as under sub-clause 67.3, which provides\n\nthat the Arbitral Tribunal shall consist of three arbitrators, one\n\neach to be appointed by the employer and the contractor. The\n\nthird arbitrator shall be chosen by the two arbitrators so\n\nappointed by the parties and shall act as presiding arbitrator.

The Andhra Pradesh High Court, has come out with its\n\nview putting reliance upon the judgments rendered by the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1997730/\" id=\"a_150\">Yashwith Constructions (P)\n\nLtd.</a> (supra), ACC Limited (supra) &amp; <a href=\"/doc/48783751/\" id=\"a_151\">Shailesh Dhairyawan</a>\n\n(supra) by coming to conclusion that while requesting to appoint\n\nsubstitute arbitrator in the place of deceased arbitrator, first\n\nrequest is to be made for the same then only 11(6) application\n\nshould have been filed.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"48783751\" id=\"span_105\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1997730\" id=\"span_106\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"48783751\" id=\"span_107\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1997730\" id=\"span_108\">28.   But, this Court is in respectful disagreement with the\n\nfinding arrived at by the Andhra Pradesh High Court due to the\n\nreason that the judgment upon which the reliance has been\n\nplaced by the Andhra Pradesh High Court either in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1997730/\" id=\"a_152\">Yashwith Constructions (P) Ltd.</a> (supra), ACC Limited (supra) &amp;\n\n<a href=\"/doc/48783751/\" id=\"a_153\">Shailesh Dhairyawan</a> (supra), ought to have been tested on the\n\ngiven facts of the case and thereafter, the conclusion ought to\n\nhave been arrived at but by not doing so and applying the\n\njudgment rendered by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1997730/\" id=\"a_154\">Yashwith Constructions (P) Ltd.</a> (supra), ACC Limited (supra) &amp;\n\n<a href=\"/doc/48783751/\" id=\"a_155\">Shailesh Dhairyawan</a> (supra) in the given facts of those cases,\n\ncannot be accepted.</span></span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_104\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1863541\" id=\"span_109\">29.   It is not in dispute that the judgments passed by the other\n\nHigh Courts are having no binding precedence but the same has\n\ngot persuasive value. But, while taking different view, it is\n\nincumbent upon the High Court to assign reason of taking\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_110\">                         45</span>\n\n\ndifferent view, as has been held by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the\n\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/1863541/\" id=\"a_156\">Pradip J. Mehta Vs. Commissioner of Income Tax,\n\nAhmedabad</a>, (2008) 14 SCC 283, wherein, at paragraph-23, it has\n\nbeen held which reads as under:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1863541\" id=\"span_111\">&quot;23. Although, the <a href=\"/doc/1863541/\" id=\"a_157\">judgments <a href=\"/doc/1863541/\" id=\"a_158\">referred to above</a></a>\n           were cited at the Bar in the High Court, which\n           were taken note of by the learned Judges of the\n           Bench of the High Court, but without either\n           recording its agreement or dissent, it answered\n           the two questions referred to it in favour of the\n           Revenue.   Judicial   decorum,    propriety   and\n           discipline required that the High Court should,\n           especially in the event of its contra view or\n           dissent, have discussed the aforesaid judgments of\n           the different High Courts and recorded its own\n           reasons for its contra view. We quite see the fact\n           that the judgments given by a High Court are not\n           binding on the other High Court(s), but all the\n           same, they have persuasive value. Another High\n           Court would be within its right to differ with the\n           view taken by the other High Courts but, in all\n           fairness, the High Court should record its dissent\n           with reasons therefor. The judgment of the other\n           High Courts, though not binding, have persuasive\n           value which should be taken note of and dissented\n           from by recording its own reasons.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_105\">30.   This Court, therefore, on the basis of the aforesaid\n\nreasoning, i.e., coming to the view to again take recourse of the\n\nmechanism available under the contract by making request under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_159\">Section 21</a> of the Act, 1996 without considering the factual aspect\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                         46</span>\n\n\ninvolved therein, is in respectful disagreement with the view\n\ntaken by the Andhra Pradesh High Court in the case of Hemant\n\nB.

If the arbitrator being replaced was\n\nappointed by the Hon&#x27;ble Chief Justice and/or his designate in\n\naccordance with Section 11 of the 1996 Act read with applicable\n\nrules, the substitute arbitrator would also have to be appointed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_116\">                         47</span>\n\n\nby the Hon&#x27;ble Chief Justice and/or his designate in the same\n\nmanner.

This Court, after taking into consideration the view\n\nexpressed by the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of Ignatius\n\nTony Pereira (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/151754149/\" id=\"a_164\">Ramjee Power Construction Ltd.</a>\n\n(supra), is of the view that what has been <a href=\"/doc/151754149/\" id=\"a_165\">laid down by</a> the\n\nHon&#x27;ble Apex Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1997730/\" id=\"a_166\">Yashwith Constructions (P)\n\nLtd.</a> (supra) about the interpretation of the term &#x27;rules&#x27; in Section\n\n15(2) which referred to the provision for appointment contained\n\nin the arbitration agreement or any rules of any institution under\n\nwhich the disputes were referred to arbitration and since, such\n\nrules have already been resorted to, as provided in such rules in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                          48</span>\n\n\nterms of the condition stipulated in the contract since has been\n\nfollowed at the initial stage, as such, there is no reason again to\n\nask the party to request the respondent making request under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 21</a> of the Act, 1996 for appointment of an arbitrator.</span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\">      It is in this context, Section 21 is also required to be\n\nconsidered by which the commencement of arbitral proceeding\n\nwill be said to have commenced, unless otherwise aggrieved by\n\nthe parties, the arbitral proceeding in respect of a particular\n\ndispute commenced on the date on which, a request for that\n\ndispute to be referred to arbitration is received by the\n\nrespondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_109\">      Thus, the mandate of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 21</a> of the Act, 1996 warrants\n\nthat in case of no agreement in between the parties for resolving\n\nthe dispute, if the request is being made for appointment of an\n\narbitrator, the arbitral proceeding will be said to have\n\ncommenced.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_110\">33.   The law is well settled that so long as the request which has\n\nbeen made under Section 21 for appointment of sole arbitrator, is\n\nnot being acted upon within the statutory period and once the\n\napplication is being filed by taking recourse of the provision of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, 1996, the party will be seized to have\n\nexercised the jurisdiction to appoint arbitrator.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_111\">34.   Herein, in the instant case, it is admitted fact that the\n\npetitioner/applicant has filed an application making request for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_121\">                          49</span>\n\n\nappointment of arbitrator in view of the provision of <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_170\">Section 21</a> of\n\nthe Act, 1996 and only on failure on the part of the respondent,\n\nsince the arbitrator has not been appointed within the stipulated\n\nperiod, an application under <a href=\"/doc/104566/\" id=\"a_171\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, 1996 has\n\nbeen filed but the arbitral proceeding stands terminated due to\n\ndemise    of   learned   sole   arbitrator     and   if   again,   the\n\npetitioner/applicant will be relegated before the respondent for\n\nmaking a fresh request for appointment of arbitrator, the same\n\nwill not be permissible, since, the remedy available to the\n\nclaimant as per the contract since has been exhausted at the initial\n\nstage for resolution of dispute and only on its failure, an\n\napplication under Section 11(6) has been filed, therefore, all the\n\nmeasures provided under the contract since have been taken\n\nrecourse thereof, therefore, the same will be extinguished and\n\nonly a fresh application is to be filed before the High Court under\n\nSection 11(6) for appointment of substitute arbitrator, since there\n\nis nothing contrary in the contract thereto.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_112\">35.   If the objection of the learned counsel for the respondent\n\nwill be accepted, then the power for appointment of arbitrator\n\nwhich has been seized the moment application under Section\n\n11(6) has been filed, then again, the same will be revived which\n\naccording to the considered view of this Court is not permissible.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_113\">36.   This Court, in view of the aforesaid discussions on fact and\n\non consideration of the legal position as above, is of the view that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_122\">                          50</span>\n\n\nthe objection which is being raised on behalf of the respondent is\n\nnot sustainable in the eye of law, accordingly, such objection is\n\noverruled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_114\">37.   In the result, this Court is of the view that it is a fit case\n\nwhere this application is held to be maintainable.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_115\">38.   Accordingly, the instant application is held to be\n\nmaintainable.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_116\">39.   In view thereof, the instant application deserves to be\n\nallowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_117\">40.   Accordingly, the instant application stands allowed.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_118\">41.
