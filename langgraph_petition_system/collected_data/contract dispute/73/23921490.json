Damodar Das</a> [(1996) 2 SCC 216] this Court held\nthat a clause in a contract can be construed as an\n&quot;arbitration agreement&quot; only if an agreement to refer\ndisputes or differences to arbitration is expressly or\nimpliedly spelt out from the clause. We may at this juncture\nset out the well-settled principles in regard to what\nconstitutes an arbitration agreement:</span></span></span></span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">  (i) The intention of the parties to enter into an arbitration\n  agreement shall have to be gathered from the terms of\n  the agreement. If the terms of the agreement clearly\n  indicate an intention on the part of the parties to the\n  agreement to refer their disputes to a private tribunal for\n  adjudication and a willingness to be bound by the\n  decision of such tribunal on such disputes, it is\n  arbitration agreement. While there is no specific form of\n  an arbitration agreement, the words used should\n  disclose a determination and obligation to go to\n  arbitration and not merely contemplate the possibility of\n  going for arbitration. Where there is merely a possibility\n  of the parties agreeing to arbitration in future, as\n  contrasted from an obligation to refer disputes to\n  arbitration, there is no valid and binding arbitration\n  agreement.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">  (ii) Even if the words &quot;arbitration&quot; and &quot;Arbitral Tribunal\n  (or arbitrator)&quot; are not used with reference to the process\n  of settlement or with reference to the private tribunal\n  which has to adjudicate upon the disputes, in a clause\n  relating to settlement of disputes, it does not detract\n  from the clause being an arbitration agreement if it has\n  the attributes or elements of an arbitration agreement.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">  They are: (a) The agreement should be in writing. (b) The\n  parties should have agreed to refer any disputes\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\">                          28</span>\n\n(present or future) between them to the decision of a\nprivate tribunal. (c) The private tribunal should be\nempowered to adjudicate upon the disputes in an\nimpartial manner, giving due opportunity to the parties\nto put forth their case before it. (d) The parties should\nhave agreed that the decision of the private tribunal in\nrespect of the disputes will be binding on them.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_76\">(iii) Where the clause provides that in the event of\ndisputes arising between the parties, the disputes shall\nbe referred to arbitration, it is an arbitration agreement.\nWhere there is a specific and direct expression of intent\nto have the disputes settled by arbitration, it is not\nnecessary to set out the attributes of an arbitration\nagreement to make it an arbitration agreement. But\nwhere the clause relating to settlement of disputes,\ncontains words which specifically exclude any of the\nattributes of an arbitration agreement or contains\nanything that detracts from an arbitration agreement, it\nwill not be an arbitration agreement. For example, where\nan agreement requires or permits an authority to decide\na claim or dispute without hearing, or requires the\nauthority to act in the interests of only one of the parties,\nor provides that the decision of the authority will not be\nfinal and binding on the parties, or that if either party is\nnot satisfied with the decision of the authority, he may\nfile a civil suit seeking relief, it cannot be termed as an\narbitration agreement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_77\">(iv) But mere use of the word &quot;arbitration&quot; or &quot;arbitrator&quot;\nin a clause will not make it an arbitration agreement, if it\nrequires or contemplates a further or fresh consent of the\nparties for reference to arbitration. For example, use of\nwords such as &quot;parties can, if they so desire, refer their\ndisputes to arbitration&quot; or &quot;in the event of any dispute,\nthe   parties may also    agree   to   refer   the   same   to\narbitration&quot; or &quot;if any disputes arise between the\nparties, they should consider settlement by arbitration&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">in a clause relating to settlement of disputes, indicate\nthat the clause is not intended to be an arbitration\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                               29</span>\n\n        agreement. Similarly, a clause which states that &quot;if the\n        parties so decide, the disputes shall be referred to\n        arbitration&quot; or &quot;any disputes between parties, if they so\n        agree, shall be referred to arbitration&quot; is not an\n        arbitration agreement. Such clauses merely indicate a\n        desire or hope to have the disputes settled by\n        arbitration, or a tentative arrangement to explore\n        arbitration as a mode of settlement if and when a\n        dispute arises. Such clauses require the parties to arrive\n        at a further agreement to go to arbitration, as and when\n        the disputes arise. Any agreement or clause in an\n        agreement requiring or contemplating a further consent\n        or consensus before a reference to arbitration, is not an\n        arbitration agreement, but an agreement to enter into an\n        arbitration agreement in future.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_78\">      Thus, it is evident from the judgment referred\n\nhereinabove that in the case where otherwise specified\n\nin the contract decision of the Superintendent Engineer\n\nfor the time being shall be final, conclusive and binding\n\non all parties to the contract upon all questions relating\n\nto the meaning of the specifications, design, drawing\n\nand instructions hereinbefore mentioned. Taking the\n\naforesaid contents of the agreement, the High Court\n\nhas held that the Clause was an arbitration agreement\n\nas it merely conferred power upon the Superintendent\n\nEngineer to take a decision on his own and did not\n\nauthorize the parties to refer any matter to his\n\narbitration.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                             30</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_79\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_80\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"344153\" id=\"span_49\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1850352\" id=\"span_50\">It has been interpreted by Hon‟ble Apex Court in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1850352/\" id=\"a_37\">State of Orissa &amp; Ors Vs.

The Court has\n\nclarified that an arbitration agreement can either be in\n\nexpress terms or can be inferred or spelt out from the\n\nterms of the clause; and that if the purpose of the\n\nclause is only to vest in the named authority, the power\n\nof supervision of the execution of the work and\n\nadministrative control over it from time to time, it is not\n\nan arbitration agreement. It has also been held that the\n\nclause   did   not   contain     any   express   arbitration\n\nagreement, nor spelt out by implication any arbitration\n\nagreement as it did not mention any dispute or\n\nreference of such dispute for decision.</span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_81\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"64556\" id=\"span_51\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/64556/\" id=\"a_39\">State of Orissa &amp; Anr.

After consideration thereof,\n      this Court held that after perusing the contents of the said\n      clause and hearing learned counsel for the parties\n      &quot;we find ourselves in complete agreement with the view\n      taken by the High Court. Admittedly, the clause does not\n      contain any express arbitration agreement. Nor can such\n      an agreement be spelt out from its terms by implication,\n      there being no mention in it of any dispute, much less of a\n      reference thereof. On the other hand, the purpose of the\n      clause clearly appears to be to vest the Superintending\n      Engineer with supervision of the execution of the work and\n      administrative control over it from time to time.&quot;</span>\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_85\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1979603\" id=\"span_57\">It would, thereby, be clear that this Court laid down as a\n      rule that the arbitration agreement must expressly or by\n      implication be spelt out that there is an agreement to refer\n      any dispute or difference for an arbitration and the clause\n      in the contract must contain such an agreement. We are in\n      respectful agreement with the above ratio. It is obvious that\n      for resolution of any dispute or difference arising between\n      two parties to a contract, the agreement must provide\n      expressly or by necessary implication, a reference to an\n      arbitrator named therein or otherwise of any dispute or\n      difference and in its absence it is difficult to spell out\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_58\">                                33</span>\n\n      existence of such an agreement for reference to an\n      arbitration to resolve the dispute or difference contracted\n      between      the   parties.

Therefore, it is no longer good\n      law.

Clause 15 provides\n      that any doubt, difference or dispute, arising after the\n      execution of the lease deed touching the construction of the\n      terms of the lease deed or anything therein contained or\n      any matter or things connected with the said lands or the\n      working or non-working thereof or the amount or payment\n      of   any rent or royalty reserved or made payable\n      thereunder, the matter in difference shall be decided by the\n      lessor whose decision shall be final. The reference has to\n      be made to the lessor and the lessor is the Governor. His\n      decision is declared final by the terms of the contract.

The said clause reads as follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">      &quot;48.0 Settlement of disputes:\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                          36</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_45\">48.1 Any dispute(s) or difference(s) arising out of or in\nconnection with the contract shall, to the extent possible, be\nsettled amicably between the parties.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">48.2 If any dispute or difference of any kind whatsoever\nshall arise between the owner and the contractor, arising\nout of the contract for the performance of the works\nwhether during the progress of the works or after its\ncompletion or whether before or after the termination,\nabandonment or breach of the contract, it shall, in the first\nplace, be referred to and settled by the Engineer, who,\nwithin a period of thirty (30) days after being requested by\neither party to do so, shall give written notice of his\ndecision to the owner and the contractor.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">48.3 Save as hereinafter provided, such decision in respect\nof every matter so referred shall be final and binding upon\nthe parties until the completion of the works and shall\nforthwith be given effect to by the contractor who shall\nproceed with the works with all the due diligence.\n48.4 During settlement of disputes and court proceedings,\nboth parties shall be obliged to carry out their respective\nobligations under the contract.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_89\">      On a careful reading of the said clause, it is\ndemonstrable that it provides for the parties to amicably\nsettle any disputes or differences arising in connection with\nthe contract. This is the first part. The second part, as is\nperceptible, is that when disputes or differences of any\nkind arise between the parties to the contract relating to\nthe performance of the works during progress of the works\nor after its completion or before or after the termination,\nabandonment or breach of the contract, it is to be referred\nto and settled by the engineer, who, on being requested by\neither party, shall give notice of his decision within thirty\ndays to the owner and the contractor. There is also a\nstipulation that his decision in respect of every matter so\nreferred to shall be final and binding upon the parties until\nthe completion of works and is required to be given effect to\nby the contractor who shall proceed with the works with\ndue diligence. To understand the intention of the parties,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_67\">                          37</span>\n\nthis part of the clause is important. On a studied scrutiny\nof this postulate, it is graphically clear that it does not\nprovide any procedure which would remotely indicate that\nthe engineer concerned is required to act judicially as an\nadjudicator by following the principles of natural justice or\nto consider the submissions of both the parties. That apart,\nthe decision of the engineer is only binding until the\ncompletion of the works. It only casts a burden on the\ncontractor who is required to proceed with the works with\ndue diligence. Besides the aforesaid, during the settlement\nof disputes and the court proceedings, both the parties are\nobliged to carry out the necessary obligation under the\ncontract. The said clause, as we understand, has been\nengrafted to avoid delay and stoppage of work and for the\npurpose of smooth carrying on of the works. It is interesting\nto note that the burden is on the contractor to carry out the\nworks with due diligence after getting the decision from the\nengineer until the completion of the works. Thus, the\nemphasis is on the performance of the contract. The\nlanguage employed in the clause does not spell out the\nintention of the parties to get the disputes adjudicated\nthrough arbitration. It does not really provide for resolution\nof disputes.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">25. Quite apart from the above, Clause 4.1 of the\nagreement is worthy to be noted. It is as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">&quot;4.1 It is specifically agreed by and between the parties\nthat all the differences or disputes arising out of the\nagreement or touching the subject-matter of the agreement,\nshall be decided by a competent court at Bangalore.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_91\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"344153\" id=\"span_68\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"587393\" id=\"span_69\">26. Mr Viswanathan, learned Senior Counsel for the\nappellants, laying immense emphasis on the same, has\nsubmitted that the said clause not only provides the\nterritorial jurisdiction by stating a competent court at\nBangalore but, in essence and in effect, it stipulates that\nall the differences or disputes arising out of the agreement\ntouching the subject-matter of the agreement shall be\ndecided by a competent court at Bangalore. Mr Dave,\nlearned Senior Counsel for the respondents, would submit\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_70\">                           38</span>\n\nthat it only clothes the competent court at Bangalore with\nthe territorial jurisdiction and cannot be interpreted beyond\nthe same. The submission of Mr Dave, if properly\nappreciated, would convey that in case an award is\npassed by the arbitrator, all other proceedings under any\nof the provisions of the Act have to be instituted at the\ncompetent court at Bangalore. This construction, in our\nopinion, cannot be placed on the said clause. It really\nmeans that the disputes and differences are left to be\nadjudicated by the competent civil court. Thus, Clause 48,\nas we have analysed, read in conjunction with Clause 4.1,\nclearly establishes that there is no arbitration clause in the\nagreement.

This      Court,   after    considering   the   judgment\n\nrendered by Hon‟ble Supreme Court, as referred\n\nhereinabove, is of the view that following law has been\n\nlaid down to assess as to whether the agreement is\n\narbitration agreement or not, the test of which is as\n\nfollows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">      (i).The intention of the parties to enter into an\n\n      arbitration agreement shall have to be gathered\n\n      from the terms of the agreement.

This Court before considering the aforesaid\n\npropositions, as has been relied upon by learned\n\ncounsel appearing for the parties, again deems it fit and\n\nproper to go through the condition stipulated under\n\nClause 8.1 of the MoU, wherein it has been stipulated\n\nthat in case of any dispute/differences arising between\n\nthe parties hereto shall be referred to the Secretary,\n\nDepartment of Welfare, Government of Jharkhand for\n\narbitration. Admittedly, the mechanism for resolution of\n\ndispute has been carved out at Clause 8.1 of the MoU\n\nby making reference the dispute/differences before the\n\nnamed    arbitrator    for   arbitration.   Therefore,   the\n\nintention of the parties to resolve the dispute through\n\narbitration   cannot    be    disputed.     Otherwise,   the\n\nstipulation made under Clause 8.1 of the MoU to the\n\neffect that dispute/differences shall be referred for\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_85\">                             45</span>\n\narbitration and moment the word reference has been\n\nreferred in the said clause to be referred before the\n\nSecretary for the purpose of arbitration; meaning\n\nthereby that is for adjudication and as such by\n\nconsidering the judgments referred hereinabove, this\n\nCourt is of the view that the argument which has been\n\nadvanced on behalf of learned State counsel that the\n\ncondition stipulated under Clause 8.1 may not be\n\nconstrued    to   be    arbitration   agreement,   is   not\n\nacceptable to this Court for the reasons aforesaid since\n\nas per the intent of the parties, the dispute/differences\n\nis required to be referred for arbitration.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_103\">21.

Accordingly, Issue No. I is decided in favour of\n\napplicant holding clause 8.1 to be arbitration clause.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_106\">24.   Issue No. 2: This Court before answering this\n\nissue is required to consider as to whether the\n\nendeavours     have     been    taken     on     behalf     of\n\napplicants/applicants for reference of dispute before\n\nthe Secretary or not.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_107\">25.   It is specific case of the applicants that due\n\nrepresentations were submitted before the concerned\n\nauthority but the same was not referred as no reply has\n\nbeen furnished on behalf of respondents in the counter\n\naffidavit filed on their behalf. Since the Clause 8.1\n\nstipulates that in case of dispute/differences, the same\n\nshall be referred before the Secretary of the department\n\nfor arbitration, as such when the applicants have made\n\ndue   representations/applications      for    resolution   of\n\ndispute, the same having not been resolved, it was\n\nincumbent upon the concerned authorities to refer the\n\nsame before the Secretary of the concerned department\n\nas per reference clause made under Clause 8.1 of the\n\nMoU but the same has also not been referred before the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                               47</span>\n\nSecretary for arbitration and thereafter, a notice has\n\nbeen sent      to   the   Secretary   also   to   resolve   the\n\ndispute/differences but even then also no efforts have\n\nbeen taken, hence, the present applications have been\n\nfiled.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\">26.      Position of law is well settled that once the\n\ncondition stipulated in the agreement is to be followed\n\nby both the parties and in case of non-observance of\n\nthe conditions of the MoU particularly the arbitration\n\nclause the applicants will have right to take recourse of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_61\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> since the fact\n\nabout not referring the dispute before the arbitrator is\n\nnot in dispute as per counter affidavit filed on behalf\n\nrespondent, therefore, it is a case where arbitrator is\n\nrequired to be appointed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_109\">27.
