The petitioner has filed the instant petition under Section 11(4),\n\n(5) and (6) of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_1\">Arbitration &amp; Conciliation Act, 1996</a> (in short, &quot;the Act&quot;)\n\nfor appointment of an arbitrator for resolution of disputes with the\n\nrespondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">2.            A few facts relevant for the decision of the controversy\n\ninvolved as narrated in the petition may be noticed. The petitioner is an\n\nengineering company. It has developed technology for efficient management\n\nof effluent discharged in the public sewerage system.             The respondent\n\nfloated a tender for up-gradation of existing sewerage treatment plant of 15\n\nMGD capacity to 30 MDG at Diggian near Chandigarh to treat the incoming\n\nsewerage to the standard of BOD 30 mg./l by installing new units of 15\n\nMGD on MBBR technology. The said tender was performance-run for six\n\n\n\n                                       1 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 10-10-2017 01:44:04 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\"> Arbitration Case No.71 of 2015                                                     2</span>\n\n\nmonths as per DBIT on lumpsum/turnkey basis alongwith operation and\n\nmaintenance of 120 months after successful trial for 180 days.                    On\n\n28.2.2007, the petitioner company was awarded the contract and agreement\n\nwas executed between the parties. The respondent was represented through\n\nExecutive Engineer. Clause 25-A of the agreement provided for arbitration\n\nin case of dispute. It was provided therein that all disputes would be referred\n\nto the sole arbitration of Superintending Engineer of the area concerned.\n\nHowever, Chief Engineer-in-charge shall have the authority to change of\n\narbitrator on an application by either of the parties. After the award of the\n\ncontract, the petitioner was entrusted with the operation and maintenance of\n\nthe treatment plant which was directly interlinked with the sludge produced\n\nin as much as the sewerage treated by the plant upon treatment was\n\nsegregated into treated water and sludge. Unless sludge was removed by the\n\nrespondent and transported to the pits intended for storage of sludge, the\n\nplant could not operate. The scope of the work did not include handling of\n\nsludge, removal of sludge, supply of chemicals for treating the sewerage and\n\nproviding watch and ward for the entire plant. On 27.5.2010, commissioning\n\nof the project was done on trial basis for 180 days which lapsed on\n\n27.11.2010 and proved successful. Satisfied with the design supplied, the\n\nrespondent issued a certificate on 29.11.2010 stating that the plant had been\n\nperforming satisfactorily as per designed criteria and NIT conditions.\n\nConsidering     the    performance,     the        Bank   guarantee   amounting   to\n\n`1,74,90,000/- was also released. The period of maintenance and operation\n\nstarted w.e.f 28.11.2010 and was still under implementation. The price\n\nbreak up for operation and maintenance for 120 months worked out to ` 600\n\nlacs approximately i.e. ` 5 lacs a month.                 Till September 2014, the\n\nrespondent in discharge of its contractual obligation was continuously\n\n\n                                         2 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                      ::: Downloaded on - 10-10-2017 01:44:05 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\"> Arbitration Case No.71 of 2015                                              3</span>\n\n\nremoving the sludge by floating separate tenders/contracts. It also entered\n\ninto contracts for supply of chemicals. On 18.9.2014, the petitioner called\n\nupon the Executive Engineer to provide tractor, trolley and manpower for\n\ndisposal of the sludge. However, the Executive Engineer took the view that\n\nremoval of sludge and its treatment with chemicals was within the scope of\n\nthe work of the petitioner. The petitioner wrote to Executive Engineer on\n\n22.9.2014 submitting its point wise reply to the letter dated 18.9.2014. On\n\n29.9.2014, the Executive Engineer called upon the petitioner to clarify\n\ncertain points which was done by it. Despite the aforesaid clarification on\n\n18.11.2014, the Executive Engineer wrote to the petitioner that handling of\n\nsludge was deemed to be included in the contract. The petitioner on\n\n21.11.2014 repudiated the alleged assertion of the Executive Engineer. On\n\n3.12.2014, the petitioner sent a notice to the respondent saying that non\n\ndisposal of sludge and grit was likely to cause serious environmental issues\n\nwhich were solely on account of failure of the respondent. On 5.12.2014,\n\nthe respondent instead of discharging its obligations under the contract\n\nadopted coercive methods and threatened the petitioner with severe\n\nconsequences including decision of Superintending Engineer-Arbitrator of\n\ncontract qua blacklisting. Accordingly, the petitioner was constrained to file\n\nCWP No.26279 of 2014 seeking directions to the respondent to remove the\n\nsludge. On 22.12.2014, the court disposed of the said writ petition in view\n\nof the arbitration clause. The petitioner invoked the arbitration clause on\n\n26.12.2014 and wrote to the Executive Engineer for settlement of issue by\n\nEngineer-in-Chief as a first step of dispute resolution mechanism in terms of\n\nClause 25-A(iii). On 14.1.2015, in response to the aforesaid letter of the\n\npetitioner, the Executive Engineer called upon the petitioner in its office on\n\n23.1.2015 for settlement of issues. A meeting was held on 23.1.2015 and the\n\n\n                                       3 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 10-10-2017 01:44:05 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\"> Arbitration Case No.71 of 2015                                              4</span>\n\n\nissues were discussed but no major consensus was reached. Accordingly, it\n\nwas decided to refer the dispute to the arbitrator. No communication had\n\nbeen issued to the named arbitrator in the agreement namely the\n\nSuperintending Engineer appointing him as the Arbitrator to enter reference.\n\nThere was no letter on the record which showed any communication either\n\nto the Arbitrator or to the petitioner appointing the arbitrator or for that\n\nmatter even referring the disputes to him. On 24.3.2015, the petitioner wrote\n\nto the Chief Engineer in charge to exercise his power for changing the\n\narbitrator and requested him to appoint an independent arbitrator and not to\n\nrefer the disputes to the Superintending Engineer being Controlling or\n\ndealing authority. The request was not to change an arbitrator already\n\nappointed but to appoint a neutral, independent, impartial arbitrator. On\n\n27.3.2015, the arbitrator by referring to the meeting dated 23.1.2015 called\n\nupon the petitioner to file its claims before him for arbitration. Hence the\n\ninstant petition before this Court by the petitioner.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_4\">3.            A written statement has been filed on behalf of the respondent\n\nwherein it has been stated in the preliminary objections that the petition is\n\nliable to be dismissed as having become infructuous since the arbitrator\n\nalready stands appointed in terms of Clause 25-A of the contract between the\n\nparties much before the filing of the present petition. As per Clause 25-A(v),\n\nthe named arbitrator has already entered into reference on 27.3.2015 and\n\nthus this court has no jurisdiction to entertain the present petition. The\n\npetitioner can avail of other remedies for his removal and cannot approach\n\nthis court for appointment of arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">4.            Learned counsel for the petitioner submitted that the sole\n\narbitrator named under the subject contract being directly involved with the\n\n\n\n                                       4 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 10-10-2017 01:44:05 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\"> Arbitration Case No.71 of 2015                                              5</span>\n\n\ndispute in the instant contract would not be impartial or neutral thus failing\n\nto satisfy the test of impartiality and independence as mandated under the\n\nAct. Reference was made to various correspondence which had been\n\nforwarded by the Executive Engineer to the arbitrator appended as\n\nannexures to the petition to substantiate its assertion. Even a reasonable\n\napprehension of bias or impartiality is sufficient to disqualify him from\n\nbeing appointed as an arbitrator. The very active participation of the\n\nSuperintending Engineer and also request dated 24.3.2015 prior to so called\n\ndate of entering of reference on 27.3.2015, was primarily for appointment of\n\na neutral, independent and impartial arbitrator in place of named arbitrator\n\nand the same ought to be granted. Active and unhealthy participation of the\n\narbitrator much prior to his appointment, disqualified him under <a href=\"/doc/1568410/\" id=\"a_2\">Section\n\n11(8)</a> of the Act and therefore he could not claim that he was validly\n\nappointed under the Act. No intimation or communication in writing\n\nregarding appointment of arbitrator was delivered to the petitioner under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1420441/\" id=\"a_3\">Section 3(1)</a> and (2) of the Act. Reliance was placed on judgments in\n\nNorthern Railway Administration, Ministry of Railway, New Delhi vs.\n\nPatel Engineering Company Limited, (2008) 10 SCC 240, Bipromasz\n\nBipron Trading SA vs. Bharat Electronics Limited (BEL), (2012) 6 SCC\n\n384 and Denel (Proprietary) Limited vs. Ministry of Defence, (2012) 2 SCC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">759.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1534562\" id=\"span_9\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1127737\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"2073\" id=\"span_11\">5.            Learned counsel for the respondent submitted that the petition\n\nis not maintainable as it is premature in as much as the issue regarding\n\nobjections for removal of arbitrator was pending. Jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1067630/\" id=\"a_4\">sections\n\n11(4)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_5\">11(6)</a> of the Act was invoked under which appointment of new\n\narbitrator has been sought. The challenge to the appointment of arbitrator\n\nwas pending and therefore, there was no cause of action for appointment of\n\n                                       5 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 10-10-2017 01:44:05 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\"> Arbitration Case No.71 of 2015                                               6</span>\n\n\narbitrator on 8.4.2015. The arbitrator stood appointed on 26.12.2014 and\n\n23.1.2015 and not on 27.3.2015 when he issued the notice. Both the parties\n\nhad specific knowledge on 23.1.2015 that Superintending Engineer would be\n\nthe arbitrator and no objection was taken. Thus, the petitioner has invoked\n\nthe jurisdiction of Hon&#x27;ble the Chief Justice under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 11</a> of the Act\n\nwithout any cause of action in its favour and none of the eventualities\n\nprescribed in <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_7\">section 11(6)</a> of the Act are existing in the present case.\n\nReliance was placed on judgments in Iron &amp; Steel Co.

It further\n\nprovided that all disputes would be referred to the sole arbitration of\n\nSuperintending Engineer of the area concerned. The Chief Engineer-in-\n\ncharge had been empowered to change the arbitrator on an application by\n\neither of the parties. As per the contract, the petitioner was entrusted with the\n\noperation and maintenance of the treatment plant which was directly\n\ninterlinked with the sludge produced. On 18.09.2014, the petitioner\n\nrequested the Executive Engineer to provide tractor/trolley and manpower\n\nfor disposal of the sludge. The Executive Engineer informed the petitioner\n\nthat removal of sludge and its treatment with chemicals was within the scope\n\n                                      14 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 10-10-2017 01:44:05 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\"> Arbitration Case No.71 of 2015                                               15</span>\n\n\nof the work of the petitioner. On that basis, certain disputes arose between\n\nthe parties. Aggrieved thereby, the petitioner filed Civil Writ Petition\n\nNo.26279 of 2014 in this Court. The said writ petition was disposed of on\n\n22.12.2014, in view of arbitration clause in the agreement. On 26.12.2014,\n\nthe petitioner by invoking the arbitration clause wrote to the Executive\n\nEngineer for settlement of issues as a first step of dispute resolution\n\nmechanism in terms of Clause 25-A(ii). On 14.01.2015, the petitioner was\n\ncalled by the Executive Engineer in his office on 23.01.2015 for settlement\n\nof issues but no decision was taken. Accordingly, it was decided to refer the\n\ndispute to the arbitrator. No communication or letter had been issued to the\n\nnamed Arbitrator in the agreement, namely the Superintending Engineer\n\nappointing him as the arbitrator to enter reference. On 24.03.2015, the\n\npetitioner approached the Chief Engineer-in-charge for appointing an\n\nimpartial and independent arbitrator in place of the named arbitrator, i.e., the\n\nSuperintending Engineer being the controlling or dealing authority.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">13.           As per sub clause (v) of Clause 25-A, the disputes or\n\ndifferences in respect of which no decision was final at the request of either\n\nparty were to be referred to arbitration of the circle concerned made in a\n\ncommunication sent through registered A.D. post. No document had been\n\nplaced on record by the Respondent Corporation adhering to the\n\nrequirements of the said clause for referring the disputes for arbitration vide\n\ncommunication sent through registered A.D. The Superintending Engineer\n\nmerely referred to the letter dated 26.12.2014, minutes of the meeting held\n\non 23.01.2015 and called upon the petitioner to file its claim. The minutes\n\nof the proceedings held on 23.01.2015 would not satisfy the legal\n\nrequirement of appointing an arbitrator as envisaged under the\n\nAct/Agreement. The minutes of 23.1.2015 only stipulates that it was decided\n\n                                      15 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 10-10-2017 01:44:05 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\"> Arbitration Case No.71 of 2015                                              16</span>\n\n\nto refer the dispute to the sole arbitrator under Clause No.25A of the tender\n\nagreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">14.

Thereafter, no\n\nreference was ever made to the arbitrator in terms thereof till 24.3.2015 i.e.\n\nwhen the petitioner had asked for appointing an independent and impartial\n\narbitrator by changing the named arbitrator. The only document which was\n\nplaced on record by the Respondent Corporation was the file noting dated\n\n06.02.2015 stating that all the documents and contract documents be\n\nsubmitted to the Circle officer for deciding the pending issues. This showed\n\nthat the arbitrator was yet to be appointed. Further, the said document dated\n\n06.02.2015 had not been even referred to by the Superintending Engineer in\n\nhis letter dated 27.03.2015. The Apex Court in Bipromasz Bipron Trading\n\nSA,&#x27;s case (supra) held that in the absence of proper service of letter\n\nappointing arbitrator, the appointment is not valid in eyes of law and the\n\nCourt can always exercise its powers under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 11</a> of the Act and\n\nappoint an arbitrator. Thus, in the present case, there was failure on the part\n\nof the Respondent Corporation to adhere to the arbitration agreement. As\n\nobserved earlier, the petitioner had addressed a communication on 24.3.2015\n\nfor appointing an impartial and independent arbitrator by changing the\n\nnamed arbitrator and, thereafter on 27.3.2015, the Superintending Engineer,\n\ni.e. the named arbitrator had sought to proceed further which was sufficient\n\n                                      16 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 10-10-2017 01:44:05 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_36\"> Arbitration Case No.71 of 2015                                               17</span>\n\n\nfor the petitioner to invoke the jurisdiction of this Court under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 11(6)</a>\n\nof the Act by treating its request contained in letter dated 24.3.2015 as\n\nimpliedly rejected.

It is true as contended by Mr.\n                     Desai, that it is not mandatory for the Chief Justice or\n                     any person or institution designated by him to appoint the\n                     named arbitrator or arbitrators. But at the same time, due\n                     regard has to be given to the qualifications required by\n                     the agreement and other considerations.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">              23. Keeping in view the observations made above, I have\n              examined the facts pleaded in this case. I am of the opinion that\n              in the peculiar facts and circumstances of this case, it would be\n              necessary and advisable to appoint an independent arbitrator. In\n              this case, the contract is with Ministry of Defence. The\n              arbitrator Mr. Satyanarayana has been nominated by DGOF,\n              who is bound to accept the directions issued by the Union of\n              India. Mr. Satyanarayana is an employee within the same\n              organization. The attitude of the respondents towards the\n              proceeding is not indicative of an impartial approach. In fact,\n              the mandate of the earlier arbitrator was terminated on the\n              material produced before the Court, which indicated that the\n              arbitrator was biased in favour of the Union of India. In the\n              present case also, Mr. Naphade has made a reference to various\n              notices issued by the arbitrator, none of which were received by\n\n\n                                      18 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 10-10-2017 01:44:05 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\"> Arbitration Case No.71 of 2015                                                 19</span>\n\n\n              the petitioner within time. Therefore, the petitioner was\n              effectively denied the opportunity to present his case before the\n              Sole Arbitrator. Therefore, the apprehensions of the petitioner\n              cannot be said to be without any basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">              <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"2073\" id=\"span_44\">24. It must also be remembered that even while exercising the\n              jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 11(6)</a>, the Court is required to have\n              due regard to the provisions contained in <a href=\"/doc/1568410/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 11(8)</a> of the\n              Act. The aforesaid section provides that apart from ensuring\n              that the arbitrator possesses the necessary qualifications\n              required of the arbitrator by the agreement of the parties, the\n              Court shall have due regard to other considerations as are likely\n              to ensure the appointment of an independent and impartial\n              arbitrator. Keeping in view the aforesaid provision, this Court\n              in the case of <a href=\"/doc/2073/\" id=\"a_38\">Indian Oil Corporation Limited</a> (supra), whilst\n              emphasizing that normally the Court shall make the\n              appointment in terms of the agreed procedure has observed that\n              the Chief Justice or his designate may deviate from the same\n              after recording reasons for the same. In paragraph 45 of the\n              aforesaid judgment, it is observed as follows:-</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">                     &quot;45. If the arbitration agreement provides for arbitration\n                     by a named arbitrator, the courts should normally give\n                     effect to the provisions of the arbitration agreement. But\n                     as clarified by Northern Railway Admn.10, where there\n                     is material to create a reasonable apprehension that the\n                     person mentioned in the arbitration agreement as the\n                     arbitrator is not likely to act independently or impartially,\n                     or if the named person is not available, then the Chief\n                     Justice or his designate may, after recording reasons for\n                     not following the agreed procedure of referring the\n                     dispute to the named arbitrator, appoint an independent\n                     arbitrator in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/1568410/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 11(8)</a> of the Act. In\n                     other words, referring the disputes to the named arbitrator\n                     shall be the rule. The Chief Justice or his designate will\n                     have to merely reiterate the arbitration agreement by\n                     referring the parties to the named arbitrator or named\n\n\n                                      19 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 10-10-2017 01:44:05 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_46\"> Arbitration Case No.71 of 2015                                              20</span>\n\n\n                     Arbitral Tribunal.

In Bipromasz Bipron Trading SA,&#x27;s case (supra), it was held\n\nby the Supreme Court that Chief Justice or designate has power to appoint a\n\nperson other than named arbitrator where facts indicate that named arbitrator\n\nis not likely to be impartial. After elaborately discussing the case law on the\n\nsubject, it was concluded thus:-\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">               &quot;40. In view of the aforesaid observations, it would not be\n               possible to reject the petition merely on the ground that this\n               Court would have no power to make an appointment of an\n               arbitrator other than the Chairman-cum-Managing Director or\n               his designate. This Court would have the power to appoint a\n               person other than the named arbitrator, upon examination of\n               the relevant facts, which would tend to indicate that the named\n               arbitrator is not likely to be impartial. In this case, the\n               petitioner had clearly pleaded that the named arbitrator is a\n               direct subordinate of the CMD and employee of the\n               respondent. CMD is the controlling authority of all the\n               employees, who have been dealing with the subject matter in\n               the present dispute and also controlling authority of the named\n               arbitrator. Apprehending that the CMD, who had been dealing\n               with the entire contract would not act impartially as an\n               arbitrator, the petitioner had issued a notice on 20th May,\n               2011. In this notice, it was pointed out that while the entire\n               process of the performance of the contract was going on, the\n               CMD had issued a letter on 5th June, 2009 to the petitioner\n               stating that as per the company&#x27;s directives, all pending\n               supplies as on that date were &quot;put on hold&quot;. After the aforesaid\n               communication, no communication was issued to the petitioner\n               for supply of the goods as per the Purchase Order dated 3rd\n               December, 2009. Even subsequently, there were difficulties\n\n\n                                      20 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 10-10-2017 01:44:05 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\"> Arbitration Case No.71 of 2015                                                 21</span>\n\n\n               when a further lot of 24 units were supplied.

Keeping in view the aforesaid facts, I am of the opinion\n               that it would not be unreasonable for the petitioner to entertain\n               the plea that the arbitrator appointed by the respondent would\n               not be impartial. The CMD itself would not be able to act\n               independently and impartially being amenable to the directions\n               issued by the Ministry of Defence. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"973238\" id=\"span_49\">In similar circumstances,\n               this Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/973238/\" id=\"a_40\">Denel (Proprietary) Limited Vs.\n               Bharat Electronics Limited &amp; Anr.</a> (supra), this Court\n               observed as follows:-</span>\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">                       &quot;21.

It only shows that the Managing\n                       Director may not be in a position to independently\n                       decide the dispute between the parties.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_49\">               42.

This has been recognized by the legislative mandate expressed\n\nby way of amendment incorporated in the Act. The Parliament in order to\n\ngive effect to consistent view taken by the Courts on the need for fair and\n\nimpartial arbitrator had amended the Act by <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_45\">Arbitration and Conciliation\n\n(Amendment) Act, 2015</a> (in short, &quot;the amended Act&quot;) effective from\n\n23.10.2015. As per amended <a href=\"/doc/1568410/\" id=\"a_46\">Section 11(8)</a> of the Act, the Supreme Court or\n\nas the case may be, the High Court or the person or institution designated by\n\nsuch court, before appointing an arbitrator shall seek a disclosure in writing\n\nfrom the perspective arbitrator in terms of sub section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 12</a> and\n\nhave due regard to the contents of the disclosure and other considerations as\n\nare likely to secure the appointment of an independent and impartial\n\narbitrator. Further, in order to avoid parties choosing their own employees as\n\narbitrators, the Act has expressly barred such appointment and has made it a\n\ndisqualification. <a href=\"/doc/16912364/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 12(5)</a> of the amended Act provides that even if\n\nthere existed any prior agreement to the contrary where the relationship of\n\nany person with the parties or counsel or the subject matter of the dispute\n\nfalls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh Schedule shall be\n\nineligible to be appointed as an Arbitrator. Exception has been carved out\n\nwhere the parties may waive the applicability of this sub section by an\n\nexpress agreement in writing subsequent to dispute having arisen between\n\n\n\n                                      23 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 10-10-2017 01:44:05 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\"> Arbitration Case No.71 of 2015                                                24</span>\n\n\nthem.

In the present case, the named arbitrator, i.e., Superintending\n\nEngineer cannot be held to be unbiased and would act independently.

In all fairness, I proceed to examine the judgments relied upon\n\nby the learned counsel for the respondent Corporation. In Iron &amp; Steel Co.\n\nLimited&#x27;s case (supra), it was observed by the Apex Court that if the parties\n\nhave agreed on a procedure for appointing the arbitrator or arbitrators as\n\ncontemplated by sub section (2) thereof, then the dispute between the parties\n\nhas to be decided in accordance with the said procedure and recourse to the\n\nChief Justice or his designate cannot be taken straightaway. There is no\n\nquarrel with the proposition of law. However, it may be noticed that in the\n\npresent case, the respondent corporation had failed to act under the\n\nappointment procedure as envisaged under the agreement and thus, the\n\npetitioner sought appointment of an arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_54\">Section 11(6)</a> of the\n\nAct. The petitioner invoked the arbitration clause under the agreement\n\nrequesting the Executive Engineer on 26.12.2014 for settlement of the issues\n\nby the Engineer in Chief as a first step of resolving the dispute between the\n\nparties as provided under Clause 25A(ii) of the arbitration clause.          In\n\nresponse thereto, the Executive Engineer called upon the petitioner in its\n\noffice on 23.1.2015 for settlement of issues. Since no consensus could be\n\nreached between the parties, it was decided to refer the dispute to arbitration.\n\nHowever, no formal communication was ever sent to the petitioner\n\nappointing the named arbitrator in the agreement. Even if it was taken that\n\nthe named arbitrator stood appointed on 23.1.2015, still, since the petitioner\n\nfeared that Superintending Engineer named as the arbitrator in the agreement\n\nwould not be neutral or impartial in adjudicating the dispute between the\n\nparties, the petitioner requested the Chief Engineer in charge to exercise his\n\npower for changing the arbitrator.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">                                      25 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">                    ::: Downloaded on - 10-10-2017 01:44:05 :::</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\"> Arbitration Case No.71 of 2015                                                  26</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">21.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1534562\" id=\"span_61\">In <a href=\"/doc/1534562/\" id=\"a_55\">National Highways Authority of India</a>&#x27;s case (supra), it was\n\nobserved by the Apex Court that under <a href=\"/doc/605764/\" id=\"a_56\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Act, the court\n\nhas jurisdiction to make the appointment only when the person including an\n\ninstitution fails to perform any function entrusted to it under that procedure.\n\nIn the present case, the named arbitrator never commenced the arbitration\n\nproceedings by issuance of any notice prior to 24.3.2015 i.e. the date when\n\nthe petitioner invoked Clause 25A(vi) of the agreement for the appointment\n\nof impartial and independent arbitrator by changing the named arbitrator.</span>\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">22.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"2073\" id=\"span_62\">In M/s <a href=\"/doc/2073/\" id=\"a_57\">Metro Builders(Orissa) Pvt.
