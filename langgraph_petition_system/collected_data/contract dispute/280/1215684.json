M/s. Maya Ram Jia Lal (hereinafter referred to as the &quot;assessee&quot;) carries on business in the sale of wool-tops and manufacture of yarn. During the course of the assessment proceedings for the assessment year 1969-70, the Income-tax Officer found that the assessee paid a sum of Rs. 62,060 to various parties as compensation for non-fulfilling contracts to supply goods to them. The Income-tax Officer came to the conclusion that since there was no written agreement between the parties, the compensation paid for non-fulfilment of the contracts was treated as speculative in nature and was disallowed. On appeal, the assessee furnished before the Appellate Assistant Commissioner the following details regarding the claim of Rs. 62,060. \n</p>\n \n   \n   \n   \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">Name of the party\n  \n   \n   \n\nDate of Contract\n  \n   \n   \n\nQuantity Contracted\n  \n   \n   \n\nDate and Payment of advance received\n  \n   \n   \n\nDate of Payment of compensation\n  \n   \n   \n\nAmount Paid\n  \n   \n   \n\nRate at Which Paid\n  \n \n  \n   \n   \n\n \n  \n   \n   \n\n \n  \n   \n   \n\n \n  \n   \n   \n\n \n  \n   \n   \n\n \n  \n   \n   \n\n    Rs.\n</p>  \n   \n   \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">    Rs.\n</p>  \n \n  \n   \n   \n\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">M/s.

It was pointed out that due to unavoidable reasons, the assesses could not fulfil the contracts for the supply of the goods and hence had to pay damages for breach of the contracts. The assessee&#x27;s case was that the amount paid was not in the nature of speculative loss, but was in the nature of liquidated damages. The Appellate Assistant Commissioner accepted the assessee&#x27;s contention and deleted the addition of Rs. 62,060. The Department took the matter in appeal before the Income-tax Appeal-late Tribunal. The Tribunal came to the conclusion that the loss of Rs. 62,060 was on account of payment as damages for breach of the contract and was, therefore, allowable as a trading liability. It rejected the contention of the Department that it was a speculative loss within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/967611/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 43(5)</a> of the Income-tax Act, 1961 (hereinafter called &quot;the Act&quot;). <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1352508\" id=\"span_2\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"136529\" id=\"span_3\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"894414\" id=\"span_4\">In coming to the conclusion, the Tribunal relied on the decisions of the Calcutta High Court in <a href=\"/doc/894414/\" id=\"a_2\">CIT v. Pioneer Trading Co. Pvt. Ltd.</a> [1968] 70 <a href=\"/doc/136529/\" id=\"a_3\">ITR 347 and Daulatram Rawatmull v. CIT</a> [1970] 78 ITR 503 and the decision of the Mysore High Court in <a href=\"/doc/1352508/\" id=\"a_4\">Bhandari Rajmal Kushalraj v. CIT</a> [1974] 96 ITR 401. The conclusion was arrived at after recording the following observations:</span></span></span> \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">  &quot;We have gone through the details of the various transactions and find that in respect of all the transactions in dispute, the settlement was made long after the date of the delivery as contemplated in the contracts. Thus, the claim made by the assessee was based on breach of contract and does not come within the meaning of a contract settled as used in <a href=\"/doc/967611/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 43(5)</a> of the Income-tax Act, 1961.&quot;\n</blockquote> \n \n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\"> 3. The Department sought a reference and the Tribunal has referred the following two questions for our opinion : \n</p>   \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\"> &quot;(i) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in holding that the payment of Rs. 62,060 made by the assessee to the various parties during the assessment year 1969-70 was based on breach of the contracts and was not a speculation loss within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/967611/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 43(5)</a> of the Income-tax Act, 1961 ? \n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\"> (ii) Whether, on the facts and in the circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was right in law in deleting the addition of Rs. 62,060 made towards the total income of the assessee during the assessment year 1969-70 ?&quot;  \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\"> 4. Since the questions referred have to be answered on the facts and circumstances of the case, the admitted facts as are disclosed from the statement of the case and the order of the Tribunal only show that these contracts were entered into by the assessee with different concerns from May to August, 1968, of which deliveries were to be made from December, 1968, to March, 1969, according to the details tabulated above. There was no written contract. There is no evidence if the persons with whom the assessee had contracted to sell certain items gave any notice to the assessee alleging the breach of contract on the part of the assessee or ever took the matter to any court of law. All that we find from the record is that after the date of the delivery of the goods lapsed, the assessee settled the contracts by paying compensation. Beyond that, there is no record. However, in addition to this, we have the finding of the Tribunal to the effect that from the details of the transactions furnished to them, they were of the opinion that all the transactions and the disputes were settled long after the date of the (intended) delivery as contemplated in the contracts. Therefore, the only material which was before the Tribunal for not applying <a href=\"/doc/967611/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 43(5)</a> of the Act was that the transactions in disputes were settled long after the date of the (intended) delivery. On these facts, we will have to decide whether the case in hand is covered by <a href=\"/doc/967611/\" id=\"a_8\">Section 43(5)</a> of the Act or not. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_15\"> 5. Now, adverting to the legal position, it will have to be borne in mind as to what is &quot;speculative transaction&quot; within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/967611/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 43(5)</a> of the Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"682302\" id=\"span_5\">In this behalf, reference may be made to the observations made by R. S. Pathak J. in <a href=\"/doc/682302/\" id=\"a_10\">CIT v. Shantilal P. Ltd.</a> [1983] 144 ITR 57 (SC). Both sides have placed reliance on this judgment, counsel for the assessee because the matter was decided against the Department and by counsel for the Department because if the law <a href=\"/doc/682302/\" id=\"a_11\">laid down in</a> the aforesaid decision is applied to the facts of this case, the matter is to be decided in favour of the Department. There, the assessee failed to perform its part of the contract because the price of the contracted goods which were to be supplied within three months of the contract went up from Rs. 440 per kilogram to Rs. 2,000 per kilogram, and, for that reason, the assessee did not perform the contract. The opposite party who had contracted to purchase the goods, filed a suit and the dispute was referred to an arbitrator and as a result of the arbitration, the assessee had to pay compensation. On those facts, it was held that the dispute was settled between the parties by way of arbitration and the payment of compensation as a result of the arbitration did not come within the purview of &quot;speculative transaction&quot;. The following opinion of law was furnished while deciding that case (at pp. 60 and 61):</span> \n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">  &quot;Is a contract for the purchase or sale of any commodity settled when no actual delivery or transfer of the commodity is effected, and instead, compensation is awarded under an arbitration award as damages for a breach of the contract ? A contract can be said to be settled if instead of effecting the delivery or transfer of the commodity envisaged by the contract, the promisee, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1105874/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 63</a> of the Contract Act, accepts, instead of it, any satisfaction which he thinks fit. It is quite another matter where instead of such acceptance, the parties raise a dispute and no agreement can be reached for discharge of the contract. There is a breach of the contract and by virtue of <a href=\"/doc/339747/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 73</a> of the Contract Act, the party suffering by such breach becomes entitled to receive from the party who broke the contract compensation for any loss or damage caused to him thereby. There is no reason why the sense conveyed by the law relating to contracts should not be imported into the definition of &#x27;Speculative transaction&#x27;. The award of damages for the breach of a contract is not the same thing as a party to the contract accepting satisfaction of the contract otherwise than in accordance with the original terms thereof. It may be that in a general sense, the layman would understand that the contract must be regarded as settled when damages are paid by way of compensation for its breach. What is really settled by the award of such damages and their acceptance by the aggrieved party is the dispute between the Parties. The law, however, speaks of a settlement of the contract, and a contract is settled when it is either performed or the promisee dispenses with or remits, wholly or in part, the performance of the promise made to him or accepts instead of it any satisfaction which he thinks fit. We are concerned with the sense of law, and it is that sense which must prevail in Sub-section (5) of <a href=\"/doc/394567/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 43</a>.&quot; \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_16\"> 6. The underlined portion of the aforesaid quotation clearly goes to show as to what is to be seen on the facts of a case while concluding whether the transaction was speculative or not. If the dispute is settled between the parties, then it is not a speculative transaction, but if the contract is settled and under the settlement of the contract, damages are paid, it would be a speculative transaction. In the present case, we have to see whether the dispute was settled or the contract was settled. As already noticed, there is no evidence whatsoever that the other party ever raised any dispute. There is no evidence as to why the assessee was not able to perform his part of the contract. There is no evidence as to how the damages were calculated. In order to prove the damages, it was for the assessee to show that when the contract was entered into, the agreed rate was such and such and when the time for performance of the contract matured, the rate of those goods was such and such, and on the difference between the two rates, the compensation was paid not to settle the contract but to settle the dispute. All these facts are missing in this case. It has not been shown as to what was the agreed rate and what was the prevailing rate on the date of the delivery. If material had been placed on record, the Department could rebut it. We are at a loss to understand as to on what material the Tribunal allowed the deletion of Rs. 62,060. Merely because the contract had not been performed by the agreed date, it cannot be said that it was due to the default of the assessee. If the default of the assessee is not established in this case, the question of its liability would not arise and, consequently, the question of payment of damages would not arise. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1671648\" id=\"span_6\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"583497\" id=\"span_7\">7. Counsel for the Department also placed reliance on two decisions of the Supreme Court rendered by R. S. Pathak J. in <a href=\"/doc/583497/\" id=\"a_15\">Nirmal Trading Co. v. CIT</a> [1980] 121 <a href=\"/doc/1671648/\" id=\"a_16\">ITR 54 and Jute Investment Co. Ltd. v. CIT</a> [1980] 121 ITR 56, for the proposition that if the delivery of the goods is not made and it is not shown that there was any dispute between the contracting parties, then it is to be held that the settlement arrived at between the parties would be deemed to be a settlement of a contract which transaction has to be held to be speculative. In the present case, no delivery was made and it is apparent that the contracts between the parties were settled by payment and, therefore, such payments cannot be allowed and have to be disallowed being of speculative nature as they clearly come within the ambit of <a href=\"/doc/967611/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 43(5)</a> of the Act.</span></span> \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1355148\" id=\"span_8\">8. On behalf of the assessee, reliance was placed on <a href=\"/doc/1355148/\" id=\"a_18\">CIT v. Bhagwan Dass Rameshwar Dayal</a> [1984] 149 ITR 387, a decision of the Division Bench of the Delhi High Court. It was held <a href=\"/doc/1355148/\" id=\"a_19\">in that case</a> that even if there is no supply of the contracted goods, yet the transaction cannot be speculative. There is no quarrel with this proposition. That is why, the learned judges of the Delhi High Court observed that even without actual delivery, all settlements cannot be termed as speculative and it will depend on the facts of each case. In that case, the learned judges found that part of the oil was supplied under the first three contracts and under the fourth contract, no supply was made. The non-supply was for the following reasons:</span> \n</p>   \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\"> (i) failure in the market causing a breakdown in oil supplies due to fluctuation in oil prices; \n</blockquote> \n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\"> (ii) the assessee had represented its inability to shoulder any further burden due to blockage of money; a huge amount was due to the assessee from the customers.  \n</blockquote> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1355148\" id=\"span_9\">9. For these reasons, the learned judges came to the conclusion that the supplies were not made due to which disputes arose which were settled between the parties. Therefore<a href=\"/doc/1355148/\" id=\"a_20\">, <a href=\"/doc/1355148/\" id=\"a_21\">in that case</a></a>, it was held that it was not a case of settlement of contract but a settlement of dispute. Hence, this case does not help the assessee.</span> \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_20\"> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"682302\" id=\"span_10\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"894414\" id=\"span_11\">10. <a href=\"/doc/894414/\" id=\"a_22\">Adverting to Pioneer Trading Co. P. Ltd.</a>&#x27;s case [1968] 70 ITR 347 (Cal), which decision was approved by the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/682302/\" id=\"a_23\">CIT v. Shantilal P. Ltd.</a> [1983] 144 ITR 57, we find that there was a real dispute between the contracting parties which was settled and, therefore, it was held that it was not a speculative transaction. On the facts of the present case, the aforesaid case does not help the assessee and the Tribunal erred in applying it to decide the matter in favour of the assessee. Similar is the position of the other two cases referred to by the Tribunal. The facts of those cases are also entirely different and it was shown that there was a real dispute between the parties which was settled.</span></span> \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\"> 11. For the reasons recorded above, we hold that on the facts and circumstances of the case, the Tribunal was not right in holding that the payment of Rs. 62,060 made by the assessee to the various parties during the assessment year 1969-70 was not a speculative transaction within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/967611/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 43(5)</a> of the Act and it further erred in deleting the said amount. \n</p> \n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_22\"> 12. In view of what we have said above, both the questions are answered in the negative, that is, in favour of the Department and against the assessee. The Department will have its costs, counsel&#x27;s fee being Rs. 300. \n</p> \n\n","numcites":11,"numcitedby":9,"docsource":"Punjab-Haryana High Court","citetid":1215684,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":" breach of contracts","formInput":"%20breach%20of%20contracts"},{"value":"43(5)","formInput":"43%285%29"},{"value":"speculation","formInput":"speculation"}],"cats":[{"value":"speculative-transaction","formInput":"tag:speculative-transaction"},{"value":"definitions-of-certain-terms","formInput":"tag:definitions-of-certain-terms"},{"value":"dispensation-and-remittance-in-promises","formInput":"tag:dispensation-and-remittance-in-promises"},{"value":"compensation-for-breach-induced-loss-or-damage","formInput":"tag:compensation-for-breach-induced-loss-or-damage"}],"courtcopy":false,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
