From the draft of the Agreement, it appeared\n                                 that again the Respondent mentioned the settlement amount as\n                                 Rs.38,04,84,291.85/-, which was much less than what was payable under\n                                 the Scheme. The Petitioner again pointed out the difference, however the\n                                 Respondent No.1 explained that clause 8 of the Scheme takes care of any\n                                 grievance that the Petitioner may have, but the draft of the Agreement\n                                 cannot be changed since it has passed through all the relevant officers of\n                                 the Respondent No.1 Corporation.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">                                 27.

It is reiterated that the Petitioner entered into the above said\n                                 Settlement Agreement under immense pressure and without having\n                                 sufficient time to consider the effect of the Agreement and the amount\n                                 offered, even if it is not in accordance with the Scheme of the\n                                 Government.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_9\">                          9.    Learned senior counsel on behalf of the petitioner submits that the\n                          respondent no.1 arbitrarily calculated the settlement offer by taking into\n                          account only a portion of the total awarded amount (i.e., Rs. 58,53,60,449/-,\n                          awarded against the claim of petitioner) instead of the net payable amount\n                          (i.e. Rs.103,44,97,352/-). Thus, the amount paid by the respondent no.1\n                          under the garb of settlement agreement is in contravention of the clause\n                          10(b) of the VSV-II Scheme which stipulates that in case of an Arbitral\n                          Award passed on or before 31.01.2023, 65% of the net amount awarded or\n                          65% of the claim amount lodged by the contractor under the scheme,\n                          whichever is lower, is to be offered by the procuring entity as settlement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1802196\" id=\"span_31\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"48535557\" id=\"span_32\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"55939234\" id=\"span_33\">10.

In this regard, it is notable that the scheme itself contemplates that\n                          &quot;settlement agreement shall have the same meaning and consequence as the\n                          settlement agreement consequent to successful conciliation as per the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_59\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_60\">Digitally Signed          W.P.(C) 1136/2025                                                           Page 12 of 13</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_61\">By:ABHISHEK THAKUR</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">Signing Date:27.02.2025</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">06:42:26</span>\n                           <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_11\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a>&quot;.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">                          17.
