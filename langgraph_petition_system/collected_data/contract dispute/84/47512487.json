The said findings were upheld by the\n\nHon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi. Therefore, the Defendants could\n\nnot unilaterally come to a finding that it was the plaintiff who\n\nwas solely responsible for the delay of &quot;142 days&quot; when the said\n\nclaim was delay already stood adjudicated upon.\n\n(7) Even if the finding of the Arbitral Tribunal, that the parties\n\nhad admitted and agreed that the claim under Clause 2 was to be\n\nexcepted from the arbitration is taken as is, it was for the\n\ndefendants to file a recovery suit before the appropriate court for\n\nrecovery of their claim under Clause 2 and to seek a finding of\n\nthe Court as to whether they could claim the sum of Rs\n\n14,13,184 as damages for breach of contract from the plaintiff.\n\nThe same cannot be done on the basis of a unilateral decision by\n\none of the contracting party itself by proclaiming a delay of 142\n\ndays as solely attributable to the Plaintiff, especially when such\n\n\n\nM/s <a href=\"/doc/13382645/\" id=\"a_105\">Satish Builders vs Union of India</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\"> Suit No.16744/16                              Page No. 81 of 84</span>\n\ndelay was disputed and also it had been found by the Arbitrator\n\nthat some of the delay was attributable to the defendants.</span>\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"131385411\" id=\"span_167\">(8)    Moreover, as held by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court in <a href=\"/doc/131385411/\" id=\"a_106\">Tejinder\n\nDua</a> (supra), it was for the Arbitrator to decide the entitlement of\n\nthe defendants for compensation under Clause 2, but for reasons\n\nbest known to the Defendants neither the said issue was pressed\n\nbefore the Arbitrator, nor was the finding of the Arbitrator\n\nchallenged before the Hon&#x27;ble High Court. Once the defendants\n\ngave up their claim under Clause 2, the entitlement wherein was\n\nonly to be decided by the Arbitrator and not by the\n\nSuperintending Engineer, then they could not have issued the\n\nimpugned order dated 24.08.2012. No doubt that the said\n\nEngineer under Clause 2 can decide the quantum but the\n\ncondition precedent for the same was the decision of the\n\nArbitrator on the entitlement of the Defendant for compensation\n\nfor delay. Once the same was not pressed, the only alternative\n\nfor the Defendants was to file the recovery suit for adjudication\n\nof the alleged delay and entitlement by the Concerned Court.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"13382645\" id=\"span_168\">In\n\nabsence of any finding of the Arbitrator or Court of Law with\n\nregard to the entitlement of the Defendants for compensation, the\n\nconcerned authority was in no position to quantify compensation\n\nM/s <a href=\"/doc/13382645/\" id=\"a_107\">Satish Builders vs Union of India</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\"> Suit No.16744/16                              Page No. 82 of 84</span>\n\nunder Clause 2.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"131385411\" id=\"span_170\">(9) It is the admitted position moreover, that the contract was\n\ndetermined on 24.09.2005, which fact is also mentioned\n\nexplicitly in the impugned order of 24.08.2012. The period of\n\nthree years therefore (under <a href=\"/doc/1164414/\" id=\"a_108\">Article 55</a> of the <a href=\"/doc/1317393/\" id=\"a_109\">Schedule of the\n\nLimitation Act</a>) had long since elapsed by the time the\n\nDefendants made a claim of compensation/penalty of Rs\n\n14,13,184 vide the impugned order of 24.08.2012.\n\n(10) It is the admitted position that the time for performing the\n\ncontract was extended unilaterally by the defendants vide the\n\nletter dated 08.08.2005 (Ex DW-1/R44). When the time for\n\nperforming the contract is extended unilaterally, then it is\n\npresumed that the time is set at large and it ceases to be the\n\nessence of the contract. In such cases Clause 2 will become\n\ninoperative. This is what was also held by the Hon&#x27;ble High\n\nCourt of Delhi in <a href=\"/doc/131385411/\" id=\"a_110\">Tejinder Dua</a> (supra) where it was observed\n\nthat &quot;In the present case, time was set at large and hence it did\n\nnot remain essence of the contract.
