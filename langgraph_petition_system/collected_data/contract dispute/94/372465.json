The respondent contested the suit on\t the\nground\tthat  the suit was not maintainable in the  form  in\nwhich  it was framed, and disputing the correctness  of\t the\ninterpretation\tof  the clause suggested  by  the  appellant\nstated\tthat  it was ever ready and willing  and  was  still\nwilling\t to pay the legitimate dues of the  appellant.\t The\nissue regarding maintainability of the suit was not  pressed\nby  the\t respondent  at the hearing;  and  the\tother  issue\nregarding  the interpretation of the clause of the  contract\nhaving\tbeen  decided by the trial court in  favour  of\t the\nappellant, the suit was decreed and leave was granted  under\n0. 2, r. 2, Civil Procedure Code, 1908, to sue later for the\namount\tdue.  On appeal the issue as to maintainability\t was\nresuscitated   and  the\t High  Court  decided  it   in\t the\nrespondent&#x27;s  favour because of the proviso to s. 42 of\t the\nSpecific  Relief  Act, 1877, and also held  that  the  trial\ncourt was not right in granting leave under 0. 2, r. 2.\t The\nHigh  Court rejected a petition for amending the  plaint  by\nincluding a prayer for a decree for Rs. 65,000 or such other\namount\tas  may be found due on proper account\tbeing  taken\nthen made by the appellant on the ground that the claim\t for\nmoney was time-barred long before the petition for amendment\nwas  made, and because there were no  special  circumstances\njustifying the grant of the amendment.\nHELD  : (Per Sarkar and Ramaswami,JJ.) (i) If there was\t any\ncase where the respondent was not entitled to the benefit of\nthe  law of limitation, the instant case was that  one.\t  It\nwas a case in which the claim for money was in substance  in\nthe  plaint  from the beginning though it had  not  formally\nbeen made and so the respondent could not legitimately claim\nthat  the  amendment would prejudicially  affect  his  right\nunder  the  law\t of limitation, for really he  had  no\tsuch\nright. [801 A-C]\nA  party is not allowed to set up a new case or a new  cause\nof action by amendment, but it is well recognised that where\nthe  amendment\tdoes not constitute the addition  of  a\t new\ncause of action or raise a new case,, but amounts to no more\nthan a different or additional approach to the facts already\non the record, the amendment will be allowed even after\t the\nexpiry\t of  the  statutory  period  of\t  limitation.\t The\nexpression  &quot;new cause of action&quot; in this context  means,  a\nnew claim made on a new basis constituted by new facts,\t and\n&quot;new case&quot; means a new set of ideas. [799 F-H; 800 B-D]\nThe  amendment\twas  necessary for a decision  of  the\treal\ndispute\t between  the parties which was :  what\t were  their\nrights\tunder  the contract; and that  dispute\twas  clearly\ninvolved in the plaint as originally framed.\n7 97\nIt  was\t the contract which formed the cause  of  action  on\nwhich  the  suit  was  based and  the  amendment  sought  to\nintroduce  a claim based on the same cause of  action,\tthat\nis,  the same contract and introduced no new case or  facts.\nIndeed,\t the  facts on which the money claim  sought  to  be\nadded  was  based, were not in dispute, and the\t absence  of\ndetails of work was not a legitimate ground for refusing the\namendment.   The  respondent  had notice of  the  amount  of\nclaim,\twas  fully  aware that the ultimate  object  of\t the\nappellant  in filing the suit was to obtain payment of\tthat\namount,\t and  had  specifically\t expressed  in\tthe  written\nstatement, its willingness to pay the appellants  legitimate\ndues. [800 F-H 802 C, D-E]\nI.   T.\t Leash &amp; Co. v. Jardine Skinner &amp; Co. [1957]  S.C.R.\n438;  Pirgonda Hongonda Patil v. Kalgonda  Shidgonda  Patil,\n[1957] S.C.R. 595.\nCharan Das v. Amin Khan, L.R. 47 I.A. 255, applied.\nPer  Raghubar  Dayal, J. (Dissenting) : An  amendment  which\nwould  enable a plaintiff to make a claim which\t has  become\ntime  barred is as a rule to be refused and the Court  would\nexercise its special power to allow such amendment only when\nthere  are special circumstances in the case.  Such  special\ncircumstances  can  be said to exist only when\tthe  amended\nclaim was at least intended to be made by the plaintiff\t who\nhad  given  in\tthe  plaint all\t the  necessary\t facts\tI,,)\nestablish  the\tclaim but had, due to clumsy  drafting,\t not\nbeen  able to express himself clearly in the pliaint and  to\ncouch  his  relief in the proper legal form.   Such  circum-\nstances\t justify  an  amendment not  really  as\t a  judicial\nconcession  to the plaintiff to save him from  any  possible\nloss  but  on  the ground that the  original  claim  in\t the\nplaint,\t though defectively stated, really amounted  to\t the\nclaim  sought to be made by the amendment, so that, it\tdoes\nnot  in\t reality offend against the law\t of  limitation\t but\nserves the interests of justice. [813 H; 814 A-C]\nThe  plaint gave none of the facts which were necessary\t for\ngetting a decree for\t Rs. 65,000 or which might justify a\ndecree for accounting To allow the amendment  of the  plaint\nwould necessity lead to a further request for\t  furnishing\ndetails about the work done and the defendant being afforded\nan    opportunity    to\t  put\tin   a\t  further    written\nIn fact it would necessitate a de novo trial on the question\nas  to the amount due to the plaintiff.\t When the  plaintiff\ncould  not get the relief of the amended claim on the  facts\nmentioned in the plaint as originally filed,\t  the  cause\nof action for a decreefor Rs.65,000 was different   from\nthe cause of action on which thesuitordeclaration was\nfounded. It could not be said that the plaintiff intended to\nsue the defendant for the recovery of Rs. 65,000 but  failed\nto express himself clearly in the plaint and that  therefore\nhe should be allowed to make the plaint precise and clear in\nthat regard.  The fact that he reserved his right to sue for\nthe  amount indicates that he did not intend to sue for\t the\namount; and the fact that the trial court gave him leave  to\nsue later does not justify the amendment, because leave\t can\nbe  given  by  the court under 0. 2, r.\t 2  only  which\t the\nplaintiff omitted to sue for a certain relief arising out of\nthe same cause of action. [814 G; 815 B-D, F, G-H-, 816 A-B]\n(ii) Per Raghubar Dayal, J : The High Court was not in error\nin allowing    the  respondent to raise the objection as  to\nthe maintainability of the suit\t   on\t account   of\t the\nappellant not asking for further relief.\t[806 C]\nIt was incumbent on the\t  trial\t  court\t not   to   make   a\ndeclaration unless  further relief had beenprayed for even\nif the objection was not raised\t   by the party. Further ,it\ncould not be said that the objection was not\t  raised  by\nthe respondentin the trial court merely because it did riot\npress the contention.

RAGHUBAR DAYAL, J. delivered a dissenting Opinion.\nSarkar, j The question raised in this appeal is whether\t the\nHigh  Court  was  in error in  refusing\t permission  to\t the\nappellant to amend its plaint.\tWe think it was.\nThe  appellant\thad  done work for the\trespondent  under  a\ncontract  which\t only  specified  the  rates  for  different\ncategories  of work.  The contract contained  the  following\nclause : &quot;This quotation is based on prevailing labour\trate\nof  Rs. 1-4-0 per cooly but if there is increase  of  labour\nrate  of  more\tthan  10%  in  any  particular\tmonth,\t the\nproportionate increase in rate will be charged&quot;.  Subsequent\nto  the making of the contract there was an increase in\t the\nlabour\trate per cooly by 20%.\tThe appellant  claimed\tthat\nunder the clause it was entitled to the whole amount of\t the\nincrease while the respondent contended that it was entitled\nto a part of it only.  This was the only dispute between the\nparties\t in  respect of the contract.  There  was  no  other\ndispute\t either\t concerning the quantity or quality  of\t the\nwork done or otherwise howsoever.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_4\">The  appellant\tfiled  a suit against  the  respondent\tonly\nclaiming  a declaration that on a proper  interpretation  of\nthe clause it was entitled to an enhancement of 20% over the\ntendered  rates as the sole difference between\tthe  parties\nwas  about the interpretation.\tThe plaint stated that\twork\nhad  been done under the contract and that the value of\t the\nsuit for purposes of jurisdiction was Rs. 65,000, but as  it\nwas  a suit for a declaration only court fees on that  basis\nhad  been  paid.  The respondent in  its  written  statement\nchallenged the appellant&#x27;s interpretation of the clause\t but\ndid  not dispute any material fact or that the only  dispute\nwas  about the interpretation.\tThe written  statement\tcon-\ncluded\tby  saying that the respondent &quot;was ever  ready\t and\nwilling\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">799</span>\nand is still ready and willing to pay the legitimate dues to\nthe plaintiff.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">Before\tthe learned trial Judge several issues\twere  raised\nbut  it is necessary to mention only two.  One issue was  as\nto  the maintainability of the suit in the form in which  it\nhad  been  framed and the other issue was as to\t the  proper\ninterpretation of the clause.  The first of these issues was\nnot  pressed  at the hearing.  The other issue\thaving\tbeen\ndecided\t by the trial Court in favour of the appellant,\t the\nsuit  was decreed.  The other issues which had been  raised,\nhad also not been pressed.  The Court had further given\t the\nappellant  leave  under\t 0.  2 r. 2 <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_2\">of\tthe  Code  of  Civil\nProcedure</a>  to  sue later for the amount due under  the\tcon-\ntract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">The  respondent then went up in appeal to the High Court  at\nPatna.\t There\tthe issue as to the maintainability  of\t the\nsuit was resuscitated and pressed and it was decided in\t the\nrespondent&#x27;s  favour because of the terms of the proviso  to\ns. 42 of the Specific Relief Act, 1877.\t The correctness  of\nthis  view is not challenged in this Court.  In\t the  result\nthe High Court dismissed the suit.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">Now, the appellant bad in view of the High Court&#x27;s  decision\nas  to the maintainability of the suit, sought its leave  to\namend the plaint by adding an extra relief in the  following\nwords  : &quot;That a decree for Rs. 65,000 or such other  amount\nwhich may be found due on proper account being taken may  be\npassed\tin favour of the plaintiff against  the\t defendant&quot;.\nThe  amendment\thaving been refused the present\t appeal\t has\nbeen preferred.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_8\">It is not in dispute that at the date of the application for\namendment,  a suit for a money claim under the contract\t was\nbarred.\t The general rule, no doubt, is that a party is\t not\nallowed by amendment to set up a new case or a new cause  of\naction particularly when a suit on the new case or cause  of\naction\tis barred : Welch v.

That expression for the present purpose\tonly\nmeans,\ta new claim made on a new basis constituted  by\t new\nfacts.\tSuch a view was taken in Robinson v. Unicos Property\nCorporation  Ltd.(&quot;)  and  it seems to us  to  be  the\tonly\npossible  view to take.\t Any other view would make the\trule\nfutile.\t  The words &quot;new case&quot; have been understood to\tmean\n&quot;new  set of ideas&quot; : Dornan v. J. W. Ellis &amp;  Co.  Ltd.(1).\nThis  also seems to us to be a reasonable view to take.\t  No\namendment  will be allowed to introduce a new seat of  ideas\nto the prejudice of any right acquired by any party by lapse\nof time.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">Now,  how does the present case stand on these principles  ?\nDoes the amendment introduce a new cause of action or a\t new\ncase?\tWe  do\tnot  think it does.  The  suit\twas  on\t the\ncontract.   It sought the interpretation of a clause in\t the\ncontract  only for a decision of the rights of\tthe  parties\nunder  it  and for no other purpose.  It  was  the  contract\nwhich  formed  the  cause of action on which  the  suit\t was\nbased.\t The amendment seeks to introduce a claim  based  on\nthe  same cause of action, that is, the same  contract.\t  It\nintroduces no new case or facts.  Indeed the facts on  which\nthe  money  claim  sought to be added is based\tare  not  in\ndispute.  Even the amount of the claim now sought to be made\nby  amendment,\twas mentioned in the plaint in\tstating\t the\nvaluation of the suit for the purpose of jurisdiction.\t The\nrespondent  had\t notice of it.\tIt is quite clear  that\t the\ninterpretation of the clause was sought only for quantifying\nthe  money claim.   In the written statement the  respondent\nspecifically   expressed   its\twillingness   to   pay\t the\nappellant&#x27;s  legitimate\t dues  which could  only  mean\tsuch\namount as might be\n(1)  (1884) 26 Ch.

It\t was\nequally\t aware that the amount had not\tbeen\tspecifically\nclaimed\t in  the suit because the respondent   had  led\t the\nappellant  to believe that it would pay whatever  the  court\nlegitimately  found  to be due.\t It in fact said so  in\t the\nwritten\t statement.   If  there\t was  any  case\t where\t the\nrespondent  was\t not entitled to the benefit of the  law  of\nlimitation, the present is that one.  The respondent  cannot\nlegitimately  claim  that the amendment\t will  prejudicially\neffect\this right under that law for really be had  no\tsuch\nright.\t It  is a case in which the claim for money  was  in\nsubstance in the plaint from the beginning though it had not\nformally been made.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">This,  therefore, seems to us to be preeminently a case\t for\nallowing the amendment.\t The authorities also lead us to the\nsame view.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"908527\" id=\"span_8\">In <a href=\"/doc/908527/\" id=\"a_7\">L.

It was, therefore,\na  case\t where\tthe  plaintiff\thad  initially\tdeliberately\nrefused to make a claim and an amendment being allowed later\npermitting  that  claim\t to be raised after  it\t had  become\nbarred.\t It was in a sense a stronger case than the  present\none  where  the\t plaintiff had omitted\tto  make  the  claim\ninitially  on  a  wrong notion and  a  wrong  legal  advice.\nPunishing  of mistakes is, of course, not administration  of\njustice.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_18\">It  is true that the plaint does not set out the details  of\nthe work done.\tBut there never was any dispute about  them.\nIndeed\tthe  respondent\t had prepared a final  bill  of\t the\nappellant&#x27;s  dues for the work done under the  contract\t and\nthe  appellant had accepted that bill as correct  except  on\nthe  question  as &#x27;to the proper rate chargeable  under\t the\nclause.\t  Strictly  the details of the work  done  were\t not\nnecessary in the plaint for it would be a waste of time of a\ncourt  to  go into them, it not being unusual to  direct  an\nenquiry\t by  a Commissioner or a subordinate  officer  about\nsuch\n(1)  [1957] S.C.R. 438\t\t\t\t   (2)\tI.R.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">47.

Issue No. 2 was framed in that connection.\t The\ncontention  was\t not  given up by the  respondent.   It\t was\nsimply not pressed on his behalf, possibly, because it\tfelt\nstrong\ton  the\t contention  on\t the  basis  of\t which\t the\ndeclaration  was  sought.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"519726\" id=\"span_18\">I therefore do not  consider\t the\nHigh Court in error in allowing the respondent to raise\t the\nobjection  to the maintainability of the suit on account  of\nthe plaintiff not having asked for the further relief.\nIt does not however follow that the appellant must have been\nallowed,  as  a\t matter of course, to amend  the  plaint  by\nadding a claim for recovery of the amount found due.\nThe  various cases relied on in support of  this  contention\nare  cases  in\twhich the fresh relief\tclaimed\t by  way  of\namendment was not affected by the law of limitation and\t the\nobjection  to the maintainability of the suit had  not\tbeen\ntaken at an early stage of the suit.

If the point to be decided as  a\nresult\tof the amendment is not covered by  the\t controversy\nraised\tby  the\t plaint\t and  the  written  statement,,\t the\namendment  is not to be allowed necessarily, for the  simple\nreason\tthat  it  is unnecessary for  determining  the\treal\nquestions in controversy between the parties.  The Court has\nto decide the suit instituted before it and with respect  to\nthe  controversies  raised  in\tit.

This difficulty was pointed out  by\ndefendant  No.\t1 and subsequently the plaintiff  asked\t for\npermission  to\tgive further and better particulars  of\t the\nclaim made in the plaint.

In this\tease  the  plaintiff\nbrought\t a suit against several persons on  the\t allegations\nthat defendant No. 1 had borrowed certain money on a  simple\nmoney  bond  executed on August 9, 1856 and that  the  other\ndefendants claimed her property and that therefore the\tsuit\nbe decreed against defendants and the property mentioned  in\nthe plaint, with interest to date of realisation.  Defendant\nNo. 1 had also executed another bond on November 28, 1857 to\nsecure\ta  further  advance and\t &#x27;had  thereby\tpledged\t her\nzamindari estate to the plaintiff.

His suit was allowed  to\ncontinue by making proper amendment with respect to part  of\nthe  original claim, i.e., with respect to the\trecovery  of\nmoney  alone against defendant No. 1. This case\t shows\tthat\namendment  of  the  plaint was allowed so as to\t make  it  a\nplaint against defendant No. 1 alone for the recovery of the\nclaim even though if the original suit for that recovery had\nbeen  instituted  at the time it would have been  barred  by\nlimitation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_58\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1209054\" id=\"span_35\">In <a href=\"/doc/1209054/\" id=\"a_33\">Charan Das</a>&#x27; case(1) the plaintiff sued for a\t declaration\nof  his\t right to pre-empt certain property.

The  amendment  of  the\tplaint\t was\nnecessitated to clumsy drafting.  The plaintiff was  allowed\nto  express  his intention in a plainer and  less  ambiguous\nmanner.\t It was these considerations which, according to the\nPrivy  Council, outweighed the consideration that the  power\nof  amendment  should not as a rule be exercised  where\t its\neffect be to take away from a defendant a legal right  which\nhad accrued    to him by lapse of time and brought the\tcase\nwithin the principle <a href=\"/doc/1209054/\" id=\"a_35\">laid down in</a> Ali Khan&#x27;s case(1).\nThe next  case\tto be considered is Leach &amp;  Co.&#x27;S  Case(2).\nIn That case the plaintiff had filed a suit for damages\t for\nconversion\n(1) 11 M.I.

(2) [1957] S.C.R. 438.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">813</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_62\">against the defendants on the allegation that they were\t the\nagents of the plaintiffs.  This plea failed.  On appeal, the\nappellate   Court  held\t that  the  parties  stood  in\t the\nrelationship  of  seller  and purchaser and  not  agent\t and\nprincipal.   This Court, on further appeal, agreed with\t the\nfindings of the appellate Court +,hat the, suit for  damages\non  the\t footing of conversion must fail.   The\t plaintiffs,\nhowever,  applied to this Court for amendment of the  plaint\nby  raising,  in the alternative, a claim  for\tdamages\t for\nbreach\tof  contract  for non-delivery of  the\tgoods.\t The\napplication  was opposed on the ground that it introduced  a\nnew cause of action and a suit on that cause of action would\nbe  barred by )imitation.  This Court considered  there\t was\nforce  in the objection but, after giving due weight to\t it,\nwas  of\t the  opinion that it was a fit case  in  which\t the\namendment should be allowed as the new claim was based on  a\nclause\tof  the same agreement on which the  suit  had\tbeen\nfounded and therefore could not be said to be foreign to the\nscope of the suit and as the prayer in the plaint was itself\ngeneral and merely claimed damages.  This Court observed  at\np. 450\n\t      &quot;Thus, all the allegations which are necessary\n\t      for sustaining a claim for damages for  breach\n\t      of  contract are already in the plaint.\tWhat\n\t      is  lacking  is only the allegation  that\t the\n\t      plaintiffs  are, in the alternative,  entitled\n\t      to claim damages for breach of contract by the\n\t      defendants in not delivering the goods.&quot;\nHere  again,  the amendment allowed related to the  form  of\nrelief\twhich  could be claimed on the basis  of  the  facts\nalleged\t in the plaint and a clause of the document  on\t the\nbasis  of  which the suit was founded.\tThe  defect  in\t the\nplaint\twas  in giving a correct shape to  the\tlegal  claim\nwhich was open to the plaintiff and the relief sought  could\nbe  covered  by\t the original relief which  was\t couched  in\ngeneral\t language.   It may further be\tmentioned  that\t the\namendment  was considered just as the defendants  themselves\nhad  cancelled the contract without strictly complying\twith\nthe  terms  of\tthe contract and the  Court  felt  that\t the\njustice of the case required that the amendment be granted.\nIt would appear from the various cases discussed above\tthat\nan amendment which would enable a plaintiff to make a  claim\nwhich has become time-barred is as a rule to be refused\t and\nthat  the  Court would exercise its special power  to  allow\nsuch  amendment only when there be special circumstances  in\nthe  case.  The nature of those special circumstances is  to\nbe gathered from those cases in which such an amendment\t was\nallowed.  <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"506712\" id=\"span_38\">It appears to me that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">814</span>\nsuch  special  circumstances can be only  when\tthe  amended\nclaim was at least intended to be made by the plaintiff\t who\nhad given in the plaint all the necessary facts to establish\nthe  claim but had due to clumsy drafting not been  able  to\nexpress\t himself  clearly  in the plaint and  to  couch\t his\nrelief in the proper legal form.  Such circumstances justify\nan  amendment  not really as a judicial\t concession  to\t the\nplaintiff  to  save him from any possible loss\tbut  on\t the\nground\tthat  the  original  claim  in\tthe  plaint,  though\ndefectively  stated, really amounted to the claim sought  to\nbe  made  by  the amendment.  Looked at\t in  this  way,\t the\npermission  to amend does not in reality offend against\t the\nlaw of limitation and serves the interests of justice.\nAt  this stage I may properly refer to what was said by\t the\nPrivy Council in <a href=\"/doc/506712/\" id=\"a_36\">Ma Shwe Mya v. Maung Mo Hnaung</a>(1).  In that\ncase the Privy Council had to consider whether the amendment\nallowed by the Judicial Commissioner, on appeal against\t the\norder  of  the District Judge, could be allowed\t in  law  or\nnot. It observed at p. 216 :</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">\t      &quot;All rules of Court are nothing but provisions\n\t      intended\tto secure the proper  administration\n\t      of justice, and it is therefore essential that\n\t      they   should   be  made\tto  serve   and\t  be\n\t      subordinate  to  that purpose,  so  that\tfull\n\t      powers of amendment must be enjoyed and should\n\t      always  be liberally exercised, but  none\t the\n\t      less no power has yet been given to enable one\n\t      distinct cause of action to be substituted for\n\t      another, nor to change, by means of amendment,\n\t      the subject matter of the suit.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_15\">It was held that the claim after amendment would be based on\na different cause of action from that on which the  original\nclaim  was based and therefore was not the real question  in\ncontroversy between the parties in that suit.  To allow\t the\nnew  claim would be to go outside the provisions of O.6,  r.\n17, C.P.C.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">I  may now consider whether the fact,% of the  present\tcase\nare such as would justify the amendment of the plaint sought\nby the plaintiff-appellant.  The plaint in the present\tcase\ngives  no facts which are necessary to establish before\t the\nplaintiff  can\tget  a decree for Rs. 65,000  or  which\t may\njustify\t a decree for accounting.
