The defendant has filed the present application under <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 45</a> of the\n\n     Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 (hereinafter referred to as Act of\n\n     1996) praying for referring the instant suit to arbitration in terms of\n\n     Clause 19 of the agreement and for dismissal of the suit.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">2.   The plaintiff has filed the suit against the defendant for recovery of\n\n     amount of Rs. 11,93,93,474/- along with interest at the rate of 18% per\n\n     annum on account of rejection of defective goods supplied by the\n\n     defendant, difference in weight of the goods supplied, liquidated\n\n     damage due to delay in supply of goods, loss and damages suffered due\n\n     to supply of defective and incomplete products.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">3.

The plaintiff has made payment of the entire contract price of USD\n\n     18,00,000 to the defendant but the defendant failed to deliver the goods\n\n     in terms of the contract. The defendant failed to supply goods of the\n\n     required quality and the consignments supplied were short in weight by\n\n     36.338 MT. The equipment that is the blower and its efficiency and\n\n     function was dependent on weight of the material. The equipment\n\n     supplied by the defendant was deficient weight and become unusable.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                        3</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">5.   When the plaintiff attempted to assemble the equipment and put it to\n\n     use, the following transpired:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_7\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">           a.   On 1st December, 2018, there was smoke observed\n                from the PLC panel present in the blower control\n                room, subsequent to which the blower tripped.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">           b.   1st December, 2018 itself, fire was observed in the\n                soft starter panel, which again resulted in blower\n                tripping.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">           c.   Excess consumption of coke was required to\n                maintain furnace hearth temperature which showed\n                inherent manufacturing defect.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">           d.   Excess consumption of power and coke as a result of\n                the manufacturing deficiency.\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_8\">6.   The defendant has filed the instant application for referring the matter\n\n     for arbitration on the ground that the supply of goods by the defendant\n\n     was in terms of the agreement dated 27th October, 2016 and Clause 19\n\n     of the said agreement provides for arbitration, the suit is not\n\n     maintainable and the dispute is to be referred for arbitration in terms of\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 45</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_9\">7.   Mr. Jishnu Chowdhury, Learned counsel representing the plaintiff\n\n     submits that the plaintiff has filed the instant suit on the ground that\n\n     the purported agreement allegedly entered between the parties is vague,\n\n     uncertain and incapable of being made certain therefore it is invalid\n\n     and thus the plaintiff has no recourse to arbitration.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                        4</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_10\">8.   Mr. Chowdhury submits that as per the agreement, the venue of the\n\n     arbitration is at Singapore while the law governing arbitration would be\n\n     the &quot;International Arbitration Law&quot;. There is nothing known as the\n\n     International Arbitration Laws and submits that:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">           a.   The venue of the arbitration is Singapore and the\n                parties have agreed to the same.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">           b.   The parties have consciously agreed not to allow\n                Singapore laws to govern the arbitration. The\n                substantive and procedural laws governing\n                arbitration is not law of Singapore.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">           c.   Parties have agreed that international arbitration\n                laws will govern. There is nothing known as\n                International Arbitration laws.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_8\">           d.   Without contrary indicia or a contrary intention, if it\n                was simply stated that the arbitration would be held\n                at Singapore, then, Singapore laws would have\n                govern the arbitration, it would be substantive law\n                and procedural law.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">           e.   The parties have agreed that international\n                arbitration law would apply, in the absence of any\n                body of law known as the International arbitration\n                laws, the agreement is null and void. The agreement\n                is also inoperative and incapable of being\n                performed. There cannot be arbitration without any\n                governing law. Since, the governing law has nexus\n                to enforcement, setting aside, interim reliefs,\n                applicability in numerous countries etc.\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_11\">9.

Mr. Chowdhury submits that in the present case there cannot be any\n\n    arbitration   with   international       arbitration   laws.   The   arbitration\n\n    agreement is vague and indefinite and the Court cannot refer the\n\n    parties to an arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_13\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_14\">11. Mr. Debarshi Dutta with Mr. Rajarshi Dutta, Learned Advocates\n\n    representing the defendant submits that the Clause 19 of the contract\n\n    is absolutely workable and cannot be questioned before this Court.\n\n    There is no element of vagueness and/or uncertainty in Clause 19 of\n\n    the contract, as regard the intent of the parties to arbitrate in the event\n\n    any dispute arising out of the contract. He submits that <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 45</a> of\n\n    the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 mandates that a judicial\n\n    authority, when seized of an action in a matter in respect of which the\n\n    parties have made an agreement referred to in <a href=\"/doc/1211237/\" id=\"a_6\">Section 44</a> of the of\n\n    1996, shall, at the request of one of the parties or person claiming\n\n    through or under him, referred the parties to arbitration. He submits\n\n    that the only exception for refusing to refer the parties to arbitration is\n\n    when the judicial authority finds that the agreement is prima facie\n\n    found to be null and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_15\">12. Mr. Debarshi Dutta with Mr. Rajarshi Dutta submit that the plaintiff\n\n    cannot question the arbitration agreement on the alleged ground that\n\n    the same is invalid, which does not fall within any of the exception\n\n    under <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_7\">Section 45</a> of the Act of 1996 for this court to refuse to refer the\n\n    parties to arbitration. He submits that the expression &quot;the venue of\n\n    arbitration shall be Singapore&quot; in the contract has to be understood in\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                        6</span>\n\n\n    the context that there is no contrary indicia in the contract about &quot;seat&quot;\n\n    of arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">13. Mr. Debarshi Dutta with Mr. Rajarshi Dutta submit that whenever\n\n    there is designation of a place of arbitration in an arbitration clause as\n\n    being the &quot;venue&quot; of the arbitration proceedings, the expression\n\n    &quot;arbitration proceedings&quot; would make it clear that the &quot;venue&quot; is really\n\n    the &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitral proceedings as the aforesaid expression does\n\n    not include just one or more individual or particular hearing, but the\n\n    arbitration proceedings as a whole, including the making of an award\n\n    at that place.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_19\">14. Mr. Debarshi Dutta with Mr. Rajarshi Dutta submit that the fact that\n\n    the arbitral proceedings &quot;shall be held&quot; at a particular venue would also\n\n    indicate that the parties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to a\n\n    particular place, signifying thereby, that the place is the seat of the\n\n    arbitral proceedings. This coupled with there being no other significant\n\n    contrary indicia that the stated venue is merely a &quot;venue&quot; and not the\n\n    &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitral proceedings. They submits that in an international\n\n    context, if a supranational body of rules is to govern the arbitration,\n\n    this would further be an indicia that &quot;the venue&quot; so stated, would be\n\n    the seat of the arbitral proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_20\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">15.

International    Arbitration   is    arbitration    between     companies    or\n\n      individuals in different states, usually by including a provision of future\n\n      dispute in contract. Arbitration agreements and arbitral award are\n\n      enforced under the United Nations Convention on the Recognition of\n\n      Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards of 1958. The International\n\n      Centre for the Settlement of Investment Dispute also handles\n\n      arbitration, but it is limited to investor-state dispute settlement.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">            The New York Convention was drafted under the auspices of the\n\n      United Nations and has been ratified by more than 150 countries,\n\n      including most major countries involved in significant international\n\n      trade and economic transactions. The New York Convention requires\n\n      the states that have ratified it to recognise and enforce international\n\n      arbitration agreements and foreign arbitral award issued in other\n\n      contracting   states,   subject     to   certain   limited   exception.   These\n\n      provisions of the New York Convention, together with the large number\n\n      of contacting states, have created an international legal regime that\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                      9</span>\n\n\n    significantly favours the enforcement of international arbitration\n\n    agreement and awards.

There is no element of vagueness and uncertainly in Clause 19 of the\n\n    contract, as regard the intent of the parties to arbitrate in the event of\n\n    any dispute arising out of the contract. <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 45</a> of the Arbitration\n\n    and Conciliation Act, 1996, mandates that a Judicial Authority, when\n\n    seized of an action in a manner in respect of which the parties have\n\n    made an agreement referred to <a href=\"/doc/1211237/\" id=\"a_19\">Section 44</a> of the Act of 1996, shall, at\n\n    the request of one of the party or person claiming to or under the\n\n    agreement, referred to parties to arbitration is when the Judicial\n\n    Authority finds that the said agreement is prima facie found to be null\n\n    and void, inoperative or incapable of being performed. In the present\n\n    case, the plaintiff has only mentioned that the purported arbitration\n\n    agreement allegedly entered between the parties is vague, uncertain\n\n    and incapable of being made certain therefore it is invalid. Clause 19 of\n\n    the contract contains no ambiguity and clearly evinces the intention of\n\n    the parties to arbitrate. The question raised by the plaintiff does not fall\n\n    within the exception under <a href=\"/doc/160474/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 45</a> of the Act of 1996.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_37\">22. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"146487961\" id=\"span_16\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/146487961/\" id=\"a_21\">Enercon (India) Ltd. and Others</a> (supra), the Hon&#x27;ble\n\n    Supreme Court held that:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">               &quot;97. This now clears the decks for the crucial\n           question i.e. is the &quot;seat&quot; of arbitration in London or in\n           India. This is necessarily so as the location of\n           the seat will determine the courts that will have\n           exclusive jurisdiction to oversee the arbitration\n           proceedings. Therefore, understandably, much debate\n           has been generated before us on the question whether\n           the use of the phrase &quot;venue shall be in London&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">           actually refers to designation of the seat of arbitration\n           in London.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                      12</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">               133.

But the Court in these proceedings is required to\n           determine the seat of the arbitration, as the\n           respondents have taken the plea that the term &quot;venue&quot;\n           in the arbitration clause actually makes a reference to\n           the &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">              135.

In an international\n           commercial arbitration, venue can often be different\n           from the seat of arbitration. In such circumstances, the\n           hearing of the arbitration will be conducted at\n           the venue fixed by the parties, but this would not\n           bring about a change in the seat of the arbitration. This\n           is precisely the ratio in Braes of Doune. Therefore, in\n           the present case, the seat would remain in India.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"408306\" id=\"span_18\">23.

The Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/408306/\" id=\"a_22\">Encorn\n\n    (India) Ltd.</a> (Supra) already held that in an international commercial\n\n    arbitration, venue can often be different from the seat of arbitration and\n\n    in such cases the hearing of the arbitration will be conducted at the\n\n    venue fixed by the parties but this would not bring about change in the\n\n    seat of the arbitration.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">24. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"196897538\" id=\"span_19\">In the case of <a href=\"/doc/196897538/\" id=\"a_23\">Mankastu Impex Private Ltd.</a> (Supra), genre Supreme\n\n    Court held that:</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">              &quot;19. The seat of arbitration is a vital aspect of any\n           arbitration proceedings.

It is well settled that &quot;seat of arbitration&quot; and\n&quot;venue of arbitration&quot; cannot be used interchangeably.\nIt has also been established that mere expression &quot;place\nof arbitration&quot; cannot be the basis to determine the\nintention of the parties that they have intended that\nplace as the &quot;seat&quot; of arbitration. The intention of the\nparties as to the &quot;seat&quot; should be determined from other\nclauses in the agreement and the conduct of the parties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">   21. In the present case, the arbitration agreement\nentered into between the parties provides Hong Kong as\nthe place of arbitration. The agreement between the\nparties choosing &quot;Hong Kong&quot; as the place of arbitration\nby itself will not lead to the conclusion that the parties\nhave chosen Hong Kong as the seat of arbitration. The\nwords, &quot;the place of arbitration&quot; shall be &quot;Hong Kong&quot;,\nhave to be read along with Clause 17.2. Clause 17.2\nprovides that &quot;... any dispute, controversy, difference\narising out of or relating to MoU shall be referred to and\nfinally resolved by arbitration administered in Hong\nKong....&quot;. On a plain reading of the arbitration\nagreement, it is clear that the reference to Hong Kong as\n&quot;place of arbitration&quot; is not a simple reference as the\n&quot;venue&quot; for the arbitral proceedings; but a reference to\nHong Kong is for final resolution by arbitration\nadministered in Hong Kong. The agreement between the\nparties that the dispute &quot;shall be referred to and finally\nresolved by arbitration administered in Hong Kong&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">clearly suggests that the parties have agreed that the\narbitration be seated at Hong Kong and that laws of\nHong Kong shall govern the arbitration proceedings as\nwell as have power of judicial review over the\narbitration award.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_22\">                                      14</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">               22. As pointed out earlier, Clause 17.2 of MoU\n           stipulates that the dispute arising out of or relating to\n           MoU including the existence, validity, interpretation,\n           breach or termination thereof or any dispute arising out\n           of or relating to it shall be referred to and finally\n           resolved by the arbitration administered in Hong Kong.\n           The words in Clause 17.2 that &quot;arbitration administered\n           in Hong Kong&quot; is an indicia that the seat of arbitration\n           is at Hong Kong. Once the parties have chosen &quot;Hong\n           Kong&quot; as the place of arbitration to be administered in\n           Hong Kong, the laws of Hong Kong would govern the\n           arbitration. The Indian courts have no jurisdiction for\n           appointment of the arbitrator.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_50\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">25. As per Clause 19 of the agreement provided that all disputes and\n\n    differences, whatsoever, arising between the parties in connection with\n\n    the contract which cannot be settled through the mutual negotiation in\n\n    good faith, the same shall be settled in accordance with the provisions\n\n    of the International Arbitration Law and the venue of arbitration shall\n\n    be Singapore. Whenever there is a designation of a place of arbitration\n\n    in an arbitration clause as being the &quot;venue&quot; of the arbitration\n\n    proceeding, the expression &quot;arbitration proceeding&quot; make it clear that\n\n    the venue is really the seat of the arbitral proceeding. The language has\n\n    to be contrasted with the language such as Tribunal are to meet or\n\n    have witnesses, experts or the parties where only hearing are to take\n\n    place in the venue which may lead to confusion, other things being\n\n    equal, that the venue so stated is not the seat of arbitral proceeding,\n\n    but only a convenient place of meeting. The arbitral proceedings shall\n\n    be held at a particular venue would also indicate that the parties\n\n    intended to anchor arbitral proceeding to a particular place, signifying\n\n    thereby, that the place is the seat of the arbitral proceedings.

In an international context, if a supranational\n\n    body of rules is to govern the arbitration, this would further be in\n\n    indicia that the venue so stated would be the seat of the arbitral\n\n    proceedings.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_52\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">26.

The judgment of\n           Cooke, J., in <a href=\"/doc/70870056/\" id=\"a_25\">Shashoua [Shashoua v. Sharma</a>, states:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">                        &quot;34. London arbitration is a well-known\n                    phenomenon which is often chosen by foreign\n                    nationals with a different law, such as the law\n                    of New York, governing the substantive rights\n                    of the parties. This is because of the legislative\n                    framework and supervisory powers of the\n                    courts here which many parties are keen to\n                    adopt. When therefore there is an express\n                    designation of the arbitration venue as London\n                    and no designation of any alternative place as\n                    the seat, combined with a supranational body\n                    of rules governing the arbitration and no other\n                    significant contrary indicia, the inexorable\n                    conclusion is, to my mind, that London is the\n                    juridical seat and English Law the curial law.\n                    In my judgment it is clear that either London\n                    has been designated by the parties to the\n                    arbitration agreement as the seat of the\n                    arbitration, or, having regard to the parties&#x27;\n                    agreement and all the relevant circumstances,\n                    it is the seat to be determined in accordance\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                              16</span>\n\n\n            with the final fall back provision of <a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 3</a> of\n            the Arbitration Act.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_55\">   61. It will thus be seen that wherever there is an\nexpress designation of a &quot;venue&quot;, and no designation of\nany alternative place as the &quot;seat&quot;, combined with a\nsupranational body of rules governing the arbitration, and\nno other significant contrary indicia, the inexorable\nconclusion is that the stated venue is actually the juridical\nseat of the arbitral proceeding.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_56\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">   62. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"64015856\" id=\"span_26\">In <a href=\"/doc/64015856/\" id=\"a_27\">Enercon GmbH v.

Apart from the last sentence in Clause\n      18.3 (i.e. &quot;The provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_29\">Indian Arbitration\n      and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> shall apply&quot;), it seems to\n      me that the conclusion that London is the &quot;seat&quot; of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_28\">                              17</span>\n\n\n      any arbitration there-under is beyond any possible\n      doubt. Thus, the main issue is whether this last\n      sentence is to be regarded as &quot;significant contrary\n      indicia&quot; (using the language of Cooke, J.) so as to\n      place the &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitration in India. A similar\n      issue was considered by Saville, J. in <a href=\"/doc/107363025/\" id=\"a_30\">Union of\n      India v. McDonnell           Douglas [Union          of\n      India</a> v. McDonnell Douglas Corpn., (1993) 2 Lloyd&#x27;s\n      Rep 48] which, of course, pre-dates the English 1996\n      Act. The arbitration agreement <a href=\"/doc/107363025/\" id=\"a_31\">in that case</a> provided\n      as follows:&quot;In the event of a dispute arising out of or\n      in connection with this agreement...the same shall be\n      referred to an Arbitration Tribunal...The arbitration\n      shall be conducted in accordance with the procedure\n      provided in the Indian Arbitration Act of 1940 or any\n      enactment or modification thereof. The arbitration\n      shall be conducted in the English language...The\n      seat of the arbitration proceedings shall be London,\n      United Kingdom.&quot; Saville, J. expressed the view that\n      the arguments on both sides were &quot;finely balanced&quot;</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">      but in effect concluded that the reference to the\n      <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_32\">Indian Arbitration Act, 1940</a> did not have the effect of\n      changing the &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitration designated by\n      the parties. Rather, the phrase referring to the 1940\n      Act was to be reconciled with the rest of the clause\n      by reading it as referring to the internal conduct of\n      the arbitration as opposed to the external supervision\n      of the arbitration by the courts.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">    64. The Court in Enercon GmbH then held that\nalthough the word &quot;venue&quot; is not synonymous with &quot;seat&quot;,\non the facts of that case, London -- though described as\nthe &quot;venue&quot; -- was really the &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitration. This\nwas for the reason that London was a neutral place in\nwhich neither party worked for gain, and in which no part\nof the cause of action arose. It was thus understood to be a\nneutral place in which the proceedings could be\n&quot;anchored&quot;. Secondly, the Court stressed on the expression\n&quot;arbitration proceedings&quot; in Clause 18.3, which the Court\nheld to be an expression which included not just one or\nmore individual hearings, but the arbitral proceedings as a\nwhole, culminating in the making of an award.

In other words the parties were anchoring\n      the whole arbitration process in London right up to\n      and including the making of an award. The place\n      designated for the making of an award is a\n      designation of seat. Moreover the language in Clause\n      18.3 does not refer to the venue of all hearings\n      &quot;taking place&quot; in London. Clause 18.3 instead\n      provides that the venue of the arbitration\n      proceedings &quot;shall be&quot; London. This again suggests\n      the parties intended to anchor the arbitration\n      proceedings to and in London rather than simply\n      physically locating the arbitration hearings in\n      London. Indeed in a case where evidence might need\n      to be taken or perhaps more likely inspected in India\n      it would make no commercial sense to construe the\n      provision as mandating all hearings to take place in\n      a physical place as opposed to anchoring the arbitral\n      process to and in a designated place. All agreements\n      including an arbitration agreement should be\n      construed to accord with business common sense. In\n      my view, there is no business common sense to\n      construe the arbitration agreement (as contended for\n      by EIL) in a manner which would simply deprive the\n      arbitrators of an important discretion that they\n      possess to hear evidence in a convenient\n      geographical location.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">             64. Third, Joseph QC submitted that the last\n      sentence of Clause 18.3 can be reconciled with the\n      choice of London as the seat. First, he submitted that\n      it can be read as referring simply to Part II of the\n      Indian 1996 Act i.e. the enforcement provisions.\n      Edey QC&#x27;s response was that if that is all the last\n      sentence meant, then it would be superfluous.\n      However, I do not consider that any such superfluity\n      carries much, if any, weight. Alternatively, Joseph\n      QC submitted that it can be read as referring only to\n      those provisions of the Indian 1996 Act which were\n      not inconsistent with the English 1996 Act.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_63\">       82. On a conspectus of the aforesaid judgments, it\nmay be concluded that whenever there is the designation\nof a place of arbitration in an arbitration clause as being\nthe &quot;venue&quot; of the arbitration proceedings, the expression\n&quot;arbitration proceedings&quot; would make it clear that the\n&quot;venue&quot; is really the &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitral proceedings, as\nthe aforesaid expression does not include just one or more\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                         19</span>\n\n\n          individual or particular hearing, but the arbitration\n          proceedings as a whole, including the making of an award\n          at that place. This language has to be contrasted with\n          language such as &quot;tribunals are to meet or have witnesses,\n          experts or the parties&quot; where only hearings are to take\n          place in the &quot;venue&quot;, which may lead to the conclusion,\n          other things being equal, that the venue so stated is not the\n          &quot;seat&quot; of arbitral proceedings, but only a convenient place\n          of meeting. Further, the fact that the arbitral proceedings\n          &quot;shall be held&quot; at a particular venue would also indicate\n          that the parties intended to anchor arbitral proceedings to\n          a particular place, signifying thereby, that that place is the\n          seat of the arbitral proceedings. This, coupled with there\n          being no other significant contrary indicia that the stated\n          venue is merely a &quot;venue&quot; and not the &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitral\n          proceedings, would then conclusively show that such a\n          clause designates a &quot;seat&quot; of the arbitral proceedings. In\n          an international context, if a supranational body of rules is\n          to govern the arbitration, this would further be an indicia\n          that &quot;the venue&quot;, so stated, would be the seat of the\n          arbitral proceedings. In a national context, this would be\n          replaced by the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_33\">Arbitration Act, 1996</a> as applying to the\n          &quot;stated venue&quot;, which then becomes the &quot;seat&quot; for the\n          purposes of arbitration.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">\n\n\n             In the present case in the contract, it is mentioned that the\n\n      venue of arbitration shall be at Singapore. In view of the judgment of\n\n      BGS (supra), the contract has to be understood that there is no\n\n      contrary indica in the contract about seat of arbitration.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_65\">27.
