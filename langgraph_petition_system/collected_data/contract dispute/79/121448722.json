The petitioners are the contract labourer working with\n\ndifferent contractors engaged by the Indian Space Organisation\n\n(ISRO) and its other establishments (hereinafter referred to as\n\nprincipal employer&#x27;) for the purpose of executing work in the units\n\nunder it. The petitioners claim that they are employed in various units\n\nof the principal employer and many of them have completed more\n\nthan 20 years of service. They have been engaged continuously by\n\nthe contractors to execute the work on behalf of principal employer.\n\nThe length of service rendered by the petitioners varies from 9 to 20\n\nyears. The petitioners also approached the Regional Labour\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos.14184 of 2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                   -:2:-</span>\n\nCommissioner Central, Thiruvananthapuram raising an industrial\n\ndispute for regularization in the service of principal employer.\n\nAccording to the petitioners, the contract of labour work is\n\ncamouflaged to avoid the compliance of various statutory provisions\n\nto deprive monetary benefits and welfare measures to them. The\n\npetitioners claim that the establishments of principal employer are\n\ncovered by the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_2\">Contract Labour (Regulation and\n\nAbolition) Act, 1970</a> (the &#x27;<a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_3\">CLRA Act</a>&#x27; for short). Therefore, it is argued\n\nby the learned counsel for the petitioners that the petitioners will\n\nhave to be treated as employees of principal employer and entitled\n\nfor regularization in the service of the principal employer. The\n\npetitioners have approached this court seeking for a writ of\n\nmandamus directing the principal employer not to alter the service\n\nconditions of the petitioners directly or indirectly affecting the\n\nprocedure for regularization of their service during the pendency of\n\nadjudication before the Industrial adjudicator.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_3\">      3.    Since the common question of law involved in these writ\n\npetitions and reliefs sought for are one and the same, these writ\n\npetitions are considered together for disposal.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_4\">      4.    The   principal   employer     resisted this writ    petition\n\ncontending that they discharge the sovereign function and therefore,\n\nthe establishment under them cannot be termed as an industry. It is\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos.14184 of 2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                   -:3:-</span>\n\ntheir case that the Department of Space and its functionality\n\nISRO/LPSC and its constituent centres discharge sovereign functions.\n\nIt is contended that the primary objective of the principal employer is\n\nto promote development activities of space science and technology for\n\nall round development of the nation. It is the case that principal\n\nemployer focus on core area of the work and outsource all peripheral\n\nnature of work through contract labour system. They denied having\n\nany employer-employee relationship with workers engaged by the\n\ncontractors, and also stated that officials of principal employer do not\n\nexercise any supervisory function over the workers employed by the\n\ncontractors for the execution of the work. It is also contended that\n\nwhile awarding the work, principal employer ensured compliance of\n\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_4\">CLRA Act</a> and other labour legislations. It is further\n\nstated that the terms and conditions of the contract provide that the\n\ncontractor shall obtain license under the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_5\">CLRA Act</a>. Thus, it is\n\nsubmitted that the contract labourers are not exploited and they are\n\nprovided with all rights and benefits as provided under the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_6\">CLRA Act</a>.\n\nIt is also contended by the principal employer that the grievance of\n\nthe petitioners cannot be decided by this Court and the petitioners are\n\nhaving an alternative remedy before the Central Administrative\n\nTribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_5\">       5.   Issues in these writ petitions are arising in the context of\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos.14184 of 2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                   -:4:-</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_7\">CLRA Act, 1970</a>. The case of the petitioners is that the contract\n\nawarded by the principal employer to various contractors are sham\n\nand camouflage, therefore, the Industrial Adjudicator has to decide\n\nthe nature of the contract for the purpose of absorbing the petitioners\n\nin the service of the principal employer. It is argued, if the service\n\nconditions of the petitioners are altered and they happened to be\n\nterminated, the petitioners will be deprived of ultimate benefit based\n\non outcome of industrial adjudication.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">     6.    <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_8\">The CLRA Act</a> was enacted to regulate the employment of\n\nthe contract labourers in certain establishments. There is no dispute\n\nto the fact that the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_9\">CLRA Act</a> would apply to the\n\nISRO and its units. It is also admitted that the principal employer also\n\nhave obtained registration in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1711982/\" id=\"a_10\">section 7</a> of the CLRA Act. It is\n\nalso admitted that the contractors are licensed contractors in terms of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/476610/\" id=\"a_11\">section 12</a> of CLRA Act. However, it is to be noted that, there is no\n\nprohibition issued for the employment of the contract labourers in\n\nterms of <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_12\">section 10</a> of the CLRA Act. Therefore, the industrial\n\nadjudicator, if he is called upon to decide, has to determine whether\n\nthe contract labour agreement is sham or camouflage, when there is\n\nno prohibition under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 10 (1)</a> of CLRA Act. It is apposite to refer\n\nsome of the judgments of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the context of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_14\">CLRA Act</a>. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"366376\" id=\"span_4\">In Gujarat Electricity Board, Thermal Power Station,\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos.14184 of 2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">                                      -:5:-</span>\n\n<a href=\"/doc/366376/\" id=\"a_15\">UKAI vs. Hind Mazdoor Sabha and others</a> [(1995) 5 SCC 27] an\n\nindustrial dispute was adjudicated in a claim raised by the workmen\n\ncontending that they are the employees of the principal employer and\n\nthe contract was sham and camouflage. The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme court\n\nafter elaborate discussion, in paragraph 53 (ii) held as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     &quot;53. Our conclusions and answers to the questions raised are,\n\n     therefore, as follows :\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">         [i] In view of the the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 10</a> of the Act, it is\n\n   only the appropriate Government which has the authority to abolish\n\n   genuine labour contract in accordance with the provisions of the said\n\n   Section. No Court including the industrial adjudicator has jurisdiction\n\n   to do so.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">         [ii] if the contract is sham or not genuine, the workmen of the\n\n   so called contractor can raise an industrial dispute for declaring that\n\n   they were always the employess of the principal employer and for\n\n   claiming the appropriate service conditions. When such dispute is\n\n   raised, it is not a dispute for abolition of the labour contract and\n\n   hence the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 10</a> of the Act will not bar either the\n\n   raising or the adjudication of the dispute. When such dispute is raised,\n\n   the industrial adjudicator has to decide whether the contract is sham\n\n   or genuine. It is only if the adjudicator comes to the conclusion that\n\n   the contract is sham, that he will have jurisdiction to adjudicate the\n\n   dispute. If, however, he comes to the conclusion that the contract is\n\n   genuine, he may refer the workmen to the appropriate Government\n\n   for abolition of the contract labour under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 10</a> of the Act and\n\n   keep the dispute pending. However, he can do so if the dispute is\n\n   espoused by the direct workmen of the principal employer. If the\n\n   workmen of the principal employer have not espoused the dispute,\n\f\n W.P.(C)Nos.14184 of 2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                    -:6:-</span>\n\n   the adjudicator, after coming to the conclusion that the contract is\n\n   genuine, has to reject the reference, the dispute being not an\n\n   industrial dispute within the meaning ofSection 2 (k) of the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_19\">ID Act</a>. He\n\n   will not be competent to give any relief to the workmen of the\n\n   erstwhile contractor even if the labour contract is abolished by the\n\n   appropriate Government under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 10</a> of the Act.&quot;\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">It is further held, when the contract is genuine, it is open for the\n\npermanent employee under the principal employer to raise industrial\n\ndispute or also for the workmen to approach the Government for\n\nabolishment of the contract labour under <a href=\"/doc/45909/\" id=\"a_21\">section 10</a> of the Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_8\">      7.

In Air India&#x27;s case (supra), the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court held that consequent upon abolition of the contract\n\nlabour, by issuing prohibitory notification under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 10 (1)</a> of the\n\nCLRA Act, the principal employer directly becomes employer of the\n\nworkmen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">      8.     In another judgment of the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in\n\n&#x27;Steel Authority of India Ltd. vs. National Union Waterfront\n\nworkers&#x27; [2001 7 SCC 268] over ruled the Air India&#x27;s case (supra)\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos.14184 of 2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                   -:7:-</span>\n\nand held that, on issuance of prohibitory notification under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_23\">section 10\n\n(1)</a> of the CLRA Act, prohibiting employment of contract labour or\n\notherwise, in an industrial dispute brought before it by any contract\n\nlabourer in regard to conditions of service, the industrial adjudicator\n\nwill have to consider the question whether the contract has been\n\ninterposed either on the ground of having undertaken to produce any\n\ngiven result for the establishment for supply of contract labour for\n\nwork of the establishment under a genuine contract or is a mere\n\nruse/comouflage to evade compliance with various beneficial\n\nlegislations so as to deprive the workers of the benefit thereunder. If\n\nthe contract is found to be not genuine, the principal employer who\n\nshall be directed to regularise the services of the contract labour.\n\nThus automatic absorption as propounded in Air India&#x27;s case has\n\nbeen overruled in SAIL&#x27;s case. The judgment in the SAIL&#x27;s case\n\n(supra) in fact is on the premise of prohibition notification issued\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 10 (1)</a> of the CLRA Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">      9.    The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court also had an occasion to\n\nconsider the dispute raised by the contract labour when there is no\n\nprohibition notification issued under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_25\">section 10 (1)</a> of the CLRA Act. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"144538253\" id=\"span_8\">In\n\n<a href=\"/doc/144538253/\" id=\"a_26\">International AIrpor Authority of India vs. International Cargo\n\nUnion and others</a> [2009 (13) SCC 374], it is held as follows:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">   &quot;If the contract is found to be sham or nominal and merely a\n\f\n W.P.(C)Nos.14184 of 2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                    -:8:-</span>\n\n    camouflage, then the so called contract labour will have to be treated\n\n    as directe employees of the princple employer and he industrial\n\n    adjudicator should direct the principal employer to regularise their\n\n    services in the establishment subject to such conditions as it may\n\n    specify for that purpose.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">    20.

The principals in Gujarat Electicity\n\n    Board continue to govern the issue. The remedy of the workmen is\n\n    to approach the industrial adjudicator for an adjudication of their\n\n    dispute that they are the direct employees of he principal employer\n\n    and the agreement is sham, nominal and merely a camouflage, even\n\n    when there is no order under <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_29\">section 10(1)</a> of CLRA Act.&quot; (emphasis\n\n    supplied\n\nThus, in the light of the judgment in International Air Port\n\nAuthority India&#x27;s case it is clear, when there is no notification under\n\nprohibition of <a href=\"/doc/1436043/\" id=\"a_30\">section 10 (1)</a> of CLRA Act, the remedy of the workmen\n\nis to approach the industrial adjudicator for dispute.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">      10.    In Gujarat Electricity Board (supra) in categorical terms,\n\nit was held by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme court in aforenoted paragraph 53\n\n(2) as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_6\">      &quot;When such dispute is raised, the industrial adjudicator has to decide\n\nwhether the contract is sham or genuine. It is only if the adjudicator comes\n\nto the conclusion that the contract is sham, that he will have jurisdiction to\n\nadjudicate the dispute.&quot; (emphasis supplied)\n\f\n W.P.(C)Nos.14184 of 2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                    -:9:-</span>\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_13\">      11.   In the light of the above, I am of the view, the industrial\n\nadjudicator has to decide first, whether the contract is sham or\n\ngenuine, and it is     only then the industrial adjudicator will have\n\njurisdiction to decide the dispute. Therefore, it is clear in the light of\n\nthe proposition laid down in the Gujarat Electricity Board&#x27;s case\n\n(supra), the dispute raised by the workmen will have the character of\n\nindustrial dispute only on a finding by the industrial adjudicator that\n\nthe contract is sham or camouflage. Merely because a dispute has\n\nbeen raised by a workmen itself, will not result it as an industrial\n\ndispute as characterised in the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_31\">Industrial Disputes Act, 1947</a>, unless it\n\nis found that contract is sham or camouflage. I have stated so, for the\n\nreasons that the learned counsel for the petitioner Sri.Thomas\n\nAbraham strenuously contended that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1774629/\" id=\"a_32\">section 33 (b)</a>\n\nIndustrial Disputes Act,1947 conditions of service shall remain\n\nunchanged during the proceedings before the conciliation and\n\nIndustrial Adjudicator. It is also appropriate to refer Schdule V under\n\nthe <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_33\">Industrial Dispute Act, 1947</a>. Schedule V defines unfair labour\n\npractices; Clause 10 of Schedule V refers about the workmen\n\nemployed as a &quot;badlis&quot;, casuals or temporaries, and their continuation\n\nwith the employer to deprive them the status and privileges of\n\npermanent worker. It does not take in a workman who raised a dispute\n\f\n W.P.(C)Nos.14184 of 2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                   -:10:-</span>\n\nunder the contract labour. Therefore, scheme and provisions of the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_34\">Industrial Dispute Act</a> do not cover any such dispute being espoused as\n\nan industrial dispute within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_35\">Industrial Dispute Act</a> in\n\nrespect of contract labour, unless the industrial adjudicator enters into\n\na finding that the contract is sham or camouflage. No doubt, the\n\nindustrial adjudicator when declares the contract as sham, the dispute\n\nattains the status of industrial dispute as contemplated in the\n\n<a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_36\">Industrial Disputes Act</a> and workmen will be entitled for all protection\n\nas envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1774629/\" id=\"a_37\">section 33</a> of the Industrial Dispute Act.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_14\">      12.   Learned Assistant Solicitor General resisted the writ\n\npetition on the ground that ISRO and other units are discharging\n\nsovereign function and activity is being discharged by them do not\n\ncome within the ambit of an industry. I am of the view that this court\n\ncannot decide this issue without reference to the factual situation.\n\nTherefore, this issue is left open.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_15\">      13.   Learned Assisant Solicitor General also contended that the\n\nremedy of the petitioner is to approach the Central Administrative\n\nTribunal and not this court or Industrial Adjudictor.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_16\">      14.   Learned counsel Sri.Thomas Abraham, relying on a Full\n\nBench decision of the Hon&#x27;ble Calcutta High Court in W.P. 21119 of\n\n2011 and connected matters, argued that both courts and\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos.14184 of 2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                   -:11:-</span>\n\nAdministrative    Tribunal    and   the    Industrial    Adjudicator     have\n\njurisdiction to decide a question related to regularisation of contract\n\nlabour. He also referred to a judgment of Karnataka High Court in\n\nW.P.9974 of 2006.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">      15.   A Full Bench of Calcutta High Court decided the matter,\n\non a reference on account of the conflicting views of two Division\n\nBenches. One of the Division Bench held that now the Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal alone has jurisdiction in the matter of\n\nregularization of contract labourers in the Railway Service. However,\n\nanother Division Bench took the view that the Central Administrative\n\nTribunal has no jurisdiction to entertain application filed on behalf of\n\nRailway contract labours, since the contract labourers cannot be\n\nconsidered as the employees of Railway.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">      16.   The Full Bench after referring to some of the Hon&#x27;ble\n\nSupreme Court judgments answered the reference as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_7\">           &quot;We are of the opinion that when regularization /absorption\n\n    and /or reinstatement /continuance I sought in the service of the\n\n    Eastern Railway, the Central Administrative Tribunal will have the\n\n    jurisdiction and as per provisions of <a href=\"/doc/1007431/\" id=\"a_38\">section 28</a> of the Act of 1985,\n\n    the matter can also be filed before the Industrial Tribunal or the\n\n    Labour Court, as the case may be. <a href=\"/doc/1007431/\" id=\"a_39\">Section 28</a> does not oust such\n\n    jurisdiction of the Central Administrative Tribunal, it gives option to\n\n    the workman to choose the forum. Thus, High Court will have no\n\n    jurisdiction to adjudicate upon the merits of the case directing\n\n    absorption/regularization or reinstatement/continuance in service of\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos.14184 of 2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">                                  -:12:-</span>\n\n    such employees with respect to the affairs of the controversies as\n\n    contemplated within the purview of the Act of 1985/ The cases have\n\n    to be filed afresh before the Central Administrative Tribunal or\n\n    Industrial Tribunal or Labour Court, at the option of the employees.\n\n    The reference is accordingly answered.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_19\">      17.   The Full Bench decision as above, is premised on <a href=\"/doc/1290303/\" id=\"a_40\">Section\n\n28</a> of the Administrative Tribunal Act (Act 1985), I am also of the view\n\nthat in the light of the <a href=\"/doc/1007431/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 28</a> of the Act of 1985, the contract\n\nlabourer is free to agitate the claim either before Central\n\nAdministrative Tribunal or before the Industrial Adjudicator. In fact\n\n<a href=\"/doc/118339492/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 28</a> of the Central Administrative Tribunal Act saves the\n\njurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal and does not oust the\n\njurisdiction of the Industrial Tribunal. It is appropriate to quote <a href=\"/doc/1007431/\" id=\"a_43\">Sec.\n\n28</a> of the Act 1985:.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">     Exclusion of jurisdiction of Courts except the Supreme\n\n     Court - On and from the date from which any jurisdiction, powers\n\n     and authority becomes exercisable under this Act by a Tribunal in\n\n     relation to recruitment and matters concerning recruitment to any\n\n     Service or post or service matters concerning members of any\n\n     Service or persons appointed to any service or post, [no Court\n\n     except].\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">     (a) the Supreme Court; or\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_22\">     (b) any industrial Tribunal, Labour Court or other authority\n\n     constituted under the industrial <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_44\">Disputes Act, 1947</a> (14 of 1947) or\n\n     any other corresponding law for the time being in force,\n\n     shall have], or be entitled to exercise any jurisdiction, powers or\n\n     authority in relation to such recruitment or matters concerning\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos.14184 of 2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                  -:13:-</span>\n\n      such recruitment or such service matters.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_23\">Therefore, the matters covered under <a href=\"/doc/1007431/\" id=\"a_45\">Section 28</a>, the Industrial\n\nTribunal will have the jurisdiction.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_24\">      19.   The petitioner&#x27;s right therefore, for any relief during the\n\npendency of the adjudication before the industrial Adjudicator would\n\ndepend upon the decision by the Adjudicator as to the genuineness of\n\nthe contract. If ultimately it is found that the contract is sham,\n\ncertainly, the petitioner would be entitled for consideration for\n\nregularization in the employment of principal employer. The right of\n\nworkmen is protected only when such exercise is completed by the\n\nIndustrial Adjudicator or Central Administrative Tribunal as to the\n\nnature of contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">      20. A question incidentally also therefore, in the above\n\nbackground arises, whether a writ of mandamus can be issued on\n\nequitable consideration when there is no specific provision exists to\n\nprotect the interest of workmen. The writ of mandamus is an\n\nextraordinary remedy to be exercised by this Court when the\n\npetitioners have right to relief, the respondents have duty to act and\n\nthere are no other adequate remedy available to the petitioners. The\n\nCourt cannot compel the respondents not to alter the service\n\nconditions, when they have no statutory obligations, even on\n\nsympathetical or equitable grounds. It is to be noted that the\n\f\nW.P.(C)Nos.14184 of 2015 &amp; connected cases\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                  -:14:-</span>\n\npetitioners&#x27; rights are incohate and yet to be crystalised. Therefore,\n\nthis court cannot issue a writ of mandamus when there are no\n\nestablished rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_26\">      In the light of the above discussion, the petitioners are not\n\nentitled for any relief as prayed at the moment.
