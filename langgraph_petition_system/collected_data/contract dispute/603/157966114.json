(supra) reads thus :-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">          &quot;14.      defendant no.1 has filed on record a xerox copy of the\n          certificate of registration (page 7 of the compilation of documents\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n          of the defendant. The certificate shows that the defendant no.1\n          ship, at the relevant time belonged to YFM Shipping Co.Ltd. The\n          certificate is dated 6th October 2008. This shows that on the date\n          of the filing of the suit, defendant no.1 ship was not owned by the\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n          defendant nos.2 or 3. Learned counsel for the plaintiff however\n          submitted that YFM Shipping Co.Ltd which is shown to be the\n                             \n          owner of the defendant no.1 ship and YHM Shipping Co.Ltd,\n          (who is the defendant no.2) are one and the same in as much as\n          the shareholders of the former and the latter are the same and\n                            \n          they hold share capital in the same proportion. In my view,\n          merely because the shareholders are common or their holding in\n          two different companies duly registered under the <a href=\"/doc/175931292/\" id=\"a_14\">Companies\n          Registration Act</a>, is identical would not make the two companies\n          one and the same entity. It is elimentary principle of law when a\n        \n\n\n          company is incorporated it becomes a separate legal entity\n     \n\n\n\n          different from the persons constituting it. Therefore assuming for\n          the sake of argument that the shareholders of the two companies\n          are common, (presently there is no material on record that the\n          shareholders of the two companies are identical) that would not\n\n\n\n\n\n          make the defendant no.2 the owner of the defendant no.1 ship. As\n          the defendant no.1 vessel is not owned by defendant nos.2 or 3,\n          plaintiff cannot arrest the defendant no.1 vessel for the alleged\n          maritime claim against defendant nos.2 or 3. The maritime claim\n          is neither against the defendant no.1 ship nor there is any\n\n\n\n\n\n          maritime claim against the owner of the defendant no.1 ship.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_13\">    19.

The six principles, as found\n          at paragraphs 159- 164 of the case are as follows- (i)\n          ownership and control of a company were not enough to justify\n          piercing the corporate veil; (ii) the Court cannot pierce the\n          corporate veil, even in the absence of third party interests in the\n\n\n\n\n\n          company, merely because it is thought to be necessary in the\n          interests of justice; (iii) the corporate veil can be pierced only if\n          there is some impropriety; (iv) the impropriety in question must\n          be linked to the use of the company structure to avoid or\n          conceal liability; (v) to justify piercing the corporate veil, there\n          must be both control of the company by the wrongdoer(s) and\n          impropriety, that is use or misuse of the company by them as a\n          device or facade to conceal their wrongdoing; and (vi) the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                          ::: Downloaded on - 29/04/2015 00:00:17 :::</span>\n     ppn                                 13                         arbp-587.14 &amp; ors.(j).doc\n\n\n          company may be a &#x27;facade&#x27; even though it was not originally\n          incorporated with any deceptive intent, provided that it is being\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                 \n          used for the purpose of deception at the time of the relevant\n          transactions.

Thus, on relying upon the aforesaid decisions, the\n          doctrine of piercing the veil allows the Court to disregard the\n          separate legal personality of a company and impose liability\n          upon the persons exercising real control over the said company.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n                                            \n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">          However, this principle has been and should be applied in a\n          restrictive manner, that is, only in scenarios wherein it is\n                             \n          evident that the company was a mere camouflage or sham\n          deliberately created by the persons exercising control over the\n          said company for the purpose of avoiding liability. The intent of\n                            \n          piercing the veil must be such that would seek to remedy a\n          wrong done by the persons controlling the company.

The\n\n\n\n\n                                                       \n    respondents had never agreed to bind itself with the liabilities and\n    obligations of the said DEPL under the said agreement dated 22 nd March\n    2006 awarded in favour of the DEPL by the petitioners. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"1500505\" id=\"span_41\">In my view<a href=\"/doc/1500505/\" id=\"a_46\">,\n\n\n\n\n                                             \n    <a href=\"/doc/1500505/\" id=\"a_47\">the said judgment</a></a> of the Supreme Court in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1500505/\" id=\"a_48\">Chloro Controls\n                            \n    India Private Limited</a> (supra) referred to by the petitioners in the\n    arbitration petition and before the arbitral tribunal is not at all relevant\n                           \n    for the purpose of deciding this matter and reliance placed thereon by\n    the petitioners is thus misplaced.</span>\n</p>        \n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">    47.          The petitioners had canvassed before the arbitral tribunal\n     \n\n\n\n    that the arbitral tribunal shall lift the corporate veil to find out that the\n    said DEPL and the respondents herein were forming part of the said\n    Jindal Group and were one and the same entity and thus the respondents\n\n\n\n\n\n    were liable for the liabilities of the said DEPL. In my view, the arbitral\n    tribunal has no power to lift the corporate veil. Only a Court can lift the\n    corporate veil of a company if the strongest case is made out. In my\n\n\n\n\n\n    view, the prayer of the petitioners for lifting the corporate veil of the\n    said DEPL was itself not maintainable in the arbitration proceedings.\n    The said DEPL was not a party to these proceedings. Be that as it may,\n    a perusal of the arbitral award clearly indicates that the arbitral tribunal\n    has refused to lift the corporate veil after considering the evidence\n    produced by both the parties and has rendered finding of fact that no\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 29/04/2015 00:00:17 :::</span>\n     ppn                                 26                          arbp-587.14 &amp; ors.(j).doc\n\n\n    such case was made out by the petitioners for lifting the corporate veil\n\n\n\n\n                                                                                  \n    which are not perverse and thus cannot be interfered with by this Court\n    under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_49\">Section 34</a> of the Arbitration Act.\n</p>\n\n\n\n                                                        \n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">    48.

It is not the\n                            \n    case of the petitioners that there was any impropriety which was linked\n    to the use of the company structure to avoid or conceal liability. It is held\n                           \n    by the Supreme Court that to justify piercing the corporate veil, there\n    must be both control of the company by the wrongdoers and impropriety,\n    that is use or misuse of the company by them as a device or facade to\n        \n\n\n    conceal their wrongdoing; and the company may be a &#x27;facade&#x27; even\n     \n\n\n\n    though it was not originally incorporated with any deceptive intent. The\n    Supreme Court has held that the Court cannot pierce the corporate veil,\n\n\n\n\n\n    even in the absence of third party interests in the company, merely\n    because it is thought to be necessary in the interests of justice. In my\n    view, the petitioners had failed to prove that either the said DEPL or the\n    respondents-company was a mere camouflage or sham or were\n\n\n\n\n\n    deliberately created by the persons exercising control over the said\n    company for the purpose of avoiding liability. The petitioners have not\n    made out any case for lifting the corporate veil. I am respectfully bound\n    by the judgment of the Supreme Court in the case of Balwant Rai\n    Saluja (supra) which squarely applies to the facts of this case.\n</p>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                        ::: Downloaded on - 29/04/2015 00:00:17 :::</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">     ppn                                 27                          arbp-587.14 &amp; ors.(j).doc\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_49\">    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"31621011\" id=\"span_44\">49.
