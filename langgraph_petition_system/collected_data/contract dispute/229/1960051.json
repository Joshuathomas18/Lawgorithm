The \n\n\narbitrator has found that the Government of India, Ministry of \n\n\nDefence   in   its   letter   dated   31.08.1990   has   issued   an  \n\n\ninstruction   that   if   the   rate   quoted   by   a   tenderor   was   lower \n\n\nthan 20% of the reasonable rates, the rate should be treated as \n\n\nfictitious   and   the   tender   should   be   rejected   by   a   panel   of \n\n\nofficers.     The   arbitrator   has   held   that   as   the   rates   quoted   by \n\n\nrespondent   No.2   were   below   20%   of   the   reasonable   rates   the \n\n\nagreement   entered   into   with   respondent   No.2   for   supply   of \n\n\nfruits   at   the   tendered   rates   was   hit   by   the   letter   dated \n\n\n31.08.1990   of   the   Government   of   India,   Ministry   of   Defence. \n\n\nThe   arbitrator   has   further   held   that   under   <a href=\"/doc/15421639/\" id=\"a_9\">Article   13(3)(a)</a>   of \n\n\nthe   Constitution   of   India,   law   includes   a   notification   of   the \n\n\nGovernment   and   therefore   the   letter   dated   31.08.1990   of   the \n\n\nGovernment of India, Ministry of Defence was law and as the \n\n\nconsideration or object of the agreement between the appellant \n\n\nand   the   respondent   No.2   defeated   a   provision   of   law,   the \n\n\nagreement   was   void   under   <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_10\">Section   23</a>   of   the   Indian   Contract \n\n\nAct.
