Background\n\n\n     1. In the present batch of appeals, this Court has to decide the contours\n\n           defining the independence and impartiality of arbitral tribunals under the\n\n           <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_5\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act</a> 1996.1 <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_6\">The Arbitration Act</a> allows parties to\n\n           agree on a procedure for appointment of arbitrators. The sanctity inhering in\n\n           the arbitration agreement underscores the autonomy of parties to settle their\n\n           disputes by arbitrators of their choice. However, the Arbitration Act subjects\n\n           party autonomy to certain mandatory principles such as the equality of\n\n           parties, independence and impartiality of the tribunal, and fairness of the\n\n           arbitral procedure. The reference to the Constitution Bench raises important\n\n           issues of the interplay between party autonomy and independence and\n\n           impartiality of the arbitral tribunal.\n\n      i.      Background to the reference\n\n\n     2. The Law Commission of India in its 246th Report opined that party autonomy\n\n           cannot be stretched to disregard the principles of impartiality and\n\n           independence of the arbitral process, specifically at the stage of constituting\n\n           of an arbitral tribunal.2 Hence, the Law Commission suggested automatic\n\n\n1\n   “<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_7\">Arbitration Act</a>”\n2\n  Law Commission of India, Amendments to the Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996, Report No. 246 (August\n2014). [The relevant observation reads:\n“57. The balance between procedural fairness and binding nature of these contracts, appears to have been\ntilted in favour of the latter by the Supreme Court, and the Commission believes the present position of law\nis far from satisfactory. Since the principles of impartiality and independence cannot be discarded at any\nstage of the proceedings, specifically at the stage of constitution of the arbitral tribunal, it would be\nincongruous to say that party autonomy can be exercised in complete disregard of these principles – even if\nthe same has been agreed prior to the disputes having arisen between the parties. There are certain\nminimum levels of independence and impartiality that should be required of the arbitral process regardless\nof the parties’ apparent agreement. A sensible law cannot, for instance, permit appointment of an arbitrator\n\n                                                                                             Page 4 of 113\n\f                                                                                                   PART A\n\n        disqualification of persons whose relationship with the parties falls under any\n\n        of the categories specified by law. Following upon the recommendations of\n\n        the Law Commission, Parliament enacted the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_8\">Arbitration and Conciliation\n\n        (Amendment) Act</a> 20153 to incorporate <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_9\">Section 12(5)</a><a href=\"/doc/1242720/\" id=\"a_10\">4</a>. <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_11\">Section 12(5)</a> renders\n\n        a person whose relationship with the parties falls under any of the categories\n\n        specified under the Seventh Schedule ineligible for appointment. Given the\n\n        2015 amendment, parties filed applications under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_12\">Section 11(6)</a> urging the\n\n        invalidation of appointment procedures which gave one party dominance in\n\n        appointing arbitrators.\n\n    3. In Voestalpine Schienen GmbH v. Delhi Metro Rail Corporation Ltd.,5\n\n        the arbitration clause required the Delhi Metro Rail Corporation6 to prepare\n\n        a panel of engineers comprising of serving or retired engineers of\n\n        government departments or public sector undertakings. The clause further\n\n        stated that matters where the total value was below Rupees 1.5 million\n\n        should be referred to sole arbitrators, and those exceeding the amount shall\n\n\n\n\nwho is himself a party to the dispute, or who is employed by (or similarly dependent on) one party, even if\nthis is what the parties agreed. The Commission hastens to add that Mr. PK Malhotra, the ex officio member\nof the Law Commission suggested having an exception for the State, and allow State parties to appoint\nemployee arbitrators. The Commission is of the opinion that, on this issue, there cannot be any distinction\nbetween State and non-State parties. The concept of party autonomy cannot be stretched to a point where\nit negates the very basis of having impartial and independent adjudicators for resolution of disputes. In fact,\nwhen the party appointing an adjudicator is the State, the duty to appoint an impartial and independent\nadjudicator is that much more onerous – and the right to natural justice cannot be said to have been waived\nonly on the basis of a “prior” agreement between the parties at the time of the contract and before arising of\nthe disputes.”]\n3\n  “2015 amendment”\n4\n  <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_13\">Section 12(5)</a>, Arbitration Act. [It reads:\n“(5) Notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary, any person whose relationship, with the parties or\ncounsel or the subject-matter of the dispute, falls under any of the categories specified in the Seventh\nSchedule shall be ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator:\nProvided that parties may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between them, waive the applicability of this\nsub-section by an express agreement in writing.”]\n5\n  [2017] 1 SCR 798\n6\n  “DMRC”\n\n                                                                                               Page 5 of 113\n\f                                                                                                       PART A\n\n         be arbitrated before a panel of three arbitrators. The relevant clause for\n\n         disputes to be decided by three arbitrators was thus:\n\n                             “(c) For the disputes to be decided by three\n                             Arbitrators, the Purchaser will make out a list of five\n                             engineers from the aforesaid panel. The supplier\n                             and Purchaser shall choose one Arbitrator each, and\n                             the two so chosen shall choose the third Arbitrator\n                             from the said list, who shall act as the presiding\n                             Arbitrator.”\n\n\n\n    4. The issue before a two-Judge Bench of this Court was whether the panel of\n\n         arbitrators prepared by DMRC violated <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_14\">Section 12</a> of the Arbitration Act. This\n\n         Court emphasized that an arbitrator appointed in terms of the agreement\n\n         between the parties must be independent of the parties. Further, this Court\n\n         held that <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_15\">Section 12(5)</a> read with the Seventh Schedule does not put an\n\n         embargo on retired government employees from serving as arbitrators. It\n\n         held that “[b]ias or even real likelihood of bias cannot be attributed to such\n\n         highly qualified and experienced persons, simply on the ground that they\n\n         served the Central Government or PSUs.”7\n\n    5. The Court held that the arbitration clause had the following adverse\n\n         consequences: (i) the choice given by DMRC to the other party was limited;\n\n         and (ii) the discretion given to DMRC to curate a panel of five persons gave\n\n\n7\n  Voestalpine (supra) [25]. [It reads:\n“26. It cannot be said that simply because the person is a retired officer who retired from the government or\nother statutory corporation or public sector undertaking and had no connection with DMRC (the party in\ndispute), he would be treated as ineligible to act as an arbitrator. Had this been the intention of the legislature,\nthe Seventh Schedule would have covered such persons as well. Bias or even real likelihood of bias cannot\nbe attributed to such highly qualified and experienced persons, simply on the ground that they served the\nCentral Government or PSUs, even when they had no connection with DMRC. The very reason for\nempanelling these persons is to ensure that technical aspects of the dispute are suitably resolved by utilising\ntheir expertise when they act as arbitrators. It may also be mentioned herein that the Law Commission had\nproposed the incorporation of the Schedule which was drawn from the red and orange list of IBA guidelines\non conflict of interest in international arbitration with the observation that the same would be treated as the\nguide “to determine whether circumstances exist which give rise to such justifiable doubts”. Such persons do\nnot get covered by red or orange list of IBA guidelines either.”]\n\n                                                                                                    Page 6 of 113\n\f                                                                                                   PART A\n\n        rise to the suspicion that it “may have picked up its own favourites.” To\n\n        remedy the situation, it was held that a choice must be given to both parties\n\n        to nominate any person from the entire panel of arbitrators. Further, this\n\n        Court observed that in case of a government contract where the authority to\n\n        appoint an arbitrator rests with a government entity, there is an imperative\n\n        to have a “broad based panel”8 to instil confidence in the mind of the other\n\n        party and secure the principle of independence and impartiality at the stage\n\n        of the constitution of the arbitral tribunal.9\n\n    6. In TRF Ltd v. Energo Engineering Projects Ltd,10 the purchase order\n\n        issued by the respondent to the appellant contained an arbitration clause\n\n        that stated that any dispute or difference between the parties in connection\n\n        with the agreement shall be referred “to sole arbitration of the Managing\n\n        Director of Buyer or his nominee.” After a dispute arose between the parties\n\n        about the encashment of the bank guarantee, the Managing Director of the\n\n        respondent appointed a former judge of this Court as the sole arbitrator in\n\n        terms of the arbitration clause. The issue before the Bench of three Judges\n\n\n8\n  Voestalpine (supra) [28]. [“28. […] Keeping in view the spirit of the amended provision and in order to instil\nconfidence in the mind of the other party, it is imperative that panel should be broadbased. Apart from serving\nor retired engineers of government departments and public sector undertakings, engineers of prominence\nand high repute from private sector should also be included. Likewise panel should comprise of persons with\nlegal background like Judges and lawyers of repute as it is not necessary that all disputes that arise, would\nbe of technical nature. There can be disputes involving purely or substantially legal issues, that too,\ncomplicated in nature. Likewise, some disputes may have the dimension of accountancy, etc. Therefore, it\nwould also be appropriate to include persons from this field as well.]\n9\n   Voestalpine (supra) [30] [“30. Time has come to send positive signals to the international business\ncommunity, in order to create healthy arbitration environment and conducive arbitration culture in this country.\nFurther, as highlighted by the Law Commission also in its report, duty becomes more onerous in government\ncontracts, where one of the parties to the dispute is the Government or public sector undertaking itself and\nthe authority to appoint the arbitrator rests with it. In the instant case also, though choice is given by DMRC\nto the opposite party but it is limited to choose an arbitrator from the panel prepared by DMRC. It, therefore,\nbecomes imperative to have a much broadbased panel, so that there is no misapprehension that principle of\nimpartiality and independence would be discarded at any stage of the proceedings, specially at the stage of\nconstitution of the Arbitral Tribunal. We, therefore, direct that DMRC shall prepare a broadbased panel on\nthe aforesaid lines, within a period of two months from today.”]\n10\n   [2017] 7 SCR 409\n\n                                                                                                Page 7 of 113\n\f                                                                                                     PART A\n\n           was whether the Managing Director was eligible to nominate a sole arbitrator\n\n           because of <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_16\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Arbitration Act. The Court distinguished the\n\n           situation where both the parties appoint their arbitrators from a situation\n\n           where a person ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator nominates a sole\n\n           arbitrator:\n\n                             “53. […] when there are two parties, one may\n                             nominate an arbitrator and the other may appoint\n                             another. That is altogether a different situation. If\n                             there is a clause requiring the parties to nominate\n                             their respective arbitrator, their authority to nominate\n                             cannot be questioned. What really in that\n                             circumstance can be called in question is the\n                             procedural compliance and the eligibility of their\n                             arbitrator depending upon the norms provided under\n                             the Act and the Schedules appended thereto. But,\n                             here is a case where the Managing Director is the\n                             “named sole arbitrator” and he has also been\n                             conferred with the power to nominate one who can\n                             be the arbitrator in his place. Thus, there is subtle\n                             distinction.”\n\n\n\n       7. The Court relied on the maxim qui facit per alium facit per se (what one does\n\n           through another is done by oneself)11 to hold that a person who becomes\n\n           ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator cannot nominate another person\n\n           as an arbitrator:\n\n                             “57. […] once the arbitrator has become ineligible\n                             by operation of law, he cannot nominate another\n                             as an arbitrator. The arbitrator becomes\n                             ineligible as per prescription contained in\n                             <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_17\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act. It is inconceivable in law\n                             that person who is statutorily ineligible can\n                             nominate a person. …once the identity of the\n                             Managing Director as the sole arbitrator is lost,\n\n\n\n\n11\n     As applied by this Court in Pratapchand Nopaji v.

In Perkins Eastman Architects DPC v. HSCC (India) Ltd.,12 the arbitration\n\n           clause stipulated that disputes or differences between the parties to the\n\n           contract “shall be referred for adjudication through arbitration by a sole\n\n           arbitrator appointed by the CMD HSCC within 30 days from the receipt of\n\n           request from the Design Consultant.” The Bench of two Judges held that the\n\n           test to determine the possibility of bias is directly relatable to the interest the\n\n           person appointing an arbitrator has in the outcome of the dispute. The Court\n\n           held that a person having an interest in the dispute “cannot and should not\n\n           have any role in charting out any course to the dispute resolution by having\n\n           the power to appoint an arbitrator.”13\n\n       9. TRF (supra) and Perkins (supra) both dealt with a situation where a person\n\n           who was rendered ineligible in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_18\">Section 12(5)</a> was making an\n\n           appointment of a sole arbitrator. Consequently, Perkins (supra) relied on\n\n           TRF (supra) to observe that a person who has an interest in the dispute or\n\n           its outcome should not have the power to unilaterally appoint a sole\n\n           arbitrator:\n\n                            “16. […] The next sentences in the paragraph,\n                            further show that cases where both the parties could\n                            nominate respective arbitrators of their choice were\n                            found to be completely a different situation. The\n                            reason is clear that whatever advantage a party\n                            may derive by nominating an arbitrator of its\n\n12\n     [2019] 17 SCR 275\n13\n     Perkins (supra) [16]\n\n                                                                                   Page 9 of 113\n\f                                                                                       PART A\n\n                          choice would get counter-balanced by equal\n                          power with the other party. But, in a case where\n                          only one party has a right to appoint a sole\n                          arbitrator, its choice will always have an element\n                          of exclusivity in determining or charting the\n                          course for dispute resolution. Naturally, the\n                          person who has an interest in the outcome or\n                          decision of the dispute must not have the power\n                          to appoint a sole arbitrator. That has to be taken\n                          as the essence of the amendments brought in by the\n                          <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_19\">Arbitration and Conciliation (Amendment) Act, 2015</a>\n                          (3 of 2016) and recognised by the decision of this\n                          Court in TRF Ltd.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                         (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n      10. In Central Organisation for Railway Electrification v. ECI-SPIC-SMO-\n\n          MCML (JV) A Joint Venture Company,14 the arbitration was to be held\n\n          following Clause 64(3)(b) of the General Conditions of Contract. The clause\n\n          reads thus:\n\n                          “64. (3)(b) Appointment of arbitrator where\n                          applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 12(5)</a> of the A&amp;C Act has not\n                          been waived off\n\n\n\n                          The Arbitral Tribunal shall consist of a panel of three\n                          retired railway officers retired not below the rank of\n                          SAO officer, as the arbitrator. For this purpose, the\n                          Railways will send a panel of at least four names of\n                          retired railway officer(s) empanelled to work as\n                          railway arbitrator indicating their retirement date to\n                          the contractor within 60 days from the day when a\n                          written and valid demand for arbitrators is received\n                          by the GM.\n\n\n\n                          Contractor will be asked to suggest to General\n                          Manager at least two names out of the panel for\n                          appointment as contractor&#x27;s nominee within 30 days\n\n\n14\n     [2019] 16 SCR 1234 [“CORE”]\n\n                                                                                    Page 10 of 113\n\f                                                                                 PART A\n\n                     from the date of dispatch of the request by the\n                     Railways. The General Manager shall appoint at\n                     least one out of them as the contractor&#x27;s nominee\n                     and will, also simultaneously appoint the balance\n                     number of arbitrators either from the panel or from\n                     outside the panel, duly indicating the “presiding\n                     arbitrator” from amongst the three arbitrators so\n                     appointed. The GM shall complete this exercise of\n                     appointing the Arbitral Tribunal within 30 days from\n                     the receipt of the names of contract&#x27;s nominees.\n                     While nominating the arbitrators, it will be necessary\n                     to ensure that one of them has served in the\n                     Accounts Department.”\n\n\n\n11. The first relevant issue before the Bench of three Judges was whether the\n\n   appointment of retired railway officers as arbitrators was valid, given <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_21\">Section\n\n   12(5)</a> read with the Seventh Schedule. The Court relied on Voestalpine\n\n       (supra) to observe that <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_22\">Section 12(5)</a> does not bar former employees of\n\n       parties from being appointed as arbitrator. The other issue was whether the\n\n       General Manager could appoint arbitrators. The Court held that the law laid\n\n       down in TRF (supra) and Perkins (supra) was not applicable because “the\n\n       right of the General Manager in formation of Arbitral Tribunal is counter-\n\n       balanced by respondent’s power to choose any two from out of the four\n\n       names and the General Manager shall appoint at least one out of them as\n\n       the contractor’s nominee.” The Court upheld the validity of the arbitration\n\n       clause and directed the constitution of the arbitral tribunal in terms of the\n\n       agreement.\n\n ii.      The reference\n\n\n\n\n                                                                              Page 11 of 113\n\f                                                                                   PART A\n\n      12. In Union of India v. Tantia Constructions Limited,15 a three Judge Bench\n\n          prima facie disagreed with CORE (supra), observing:\n\n                       “1. … on the facts of this case, the judgment of the\n                       High Court cannot be faulted with (sic). Accordingly,\n                       the Special Leave Petition is dismissed. However,\n                       reliance has been placed upon a recent three-\n                       Judge Bench decision of this Court delivered on\n                       17.12.2019 in Central Organisation for Railway\n                       Electrification v.

We have perused the aforesaid judgment\n                       and prima facie disagree with it for the basic\n                       reason that once the appointing authority itself\n                       is incapacitated from referring the matter to\n                       arbitration, it does not then follow that\n                       notwithstanding this yet appointments may be\n                       valid depending on the facts of the case.\n\n\n\n                       2. We therefore request the Hon&#x27;ble Chief Justice to\n                       constitute a larger Bench to look into the correctness\n                       of this judgment.”\n\n\n\n                                                         (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n      13. When the reference came up on 12 July 2023, Mr R Venkataramani, the\n\n          Attorney General for India, submitted that the Union Government had\n\n          constituted an Expert Committee on Arbitration Law16 (chaired by Dr T K\n\n          Viswanathan) to reconsider the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_23\">Arbitration Act</a>. It was\n\n          further submitted that the issues that have been raised in the present\n\n          reference would fall within the broad remit of the Expert Committee. On 17\n\n          January 2024, the Constitution Bench provided three months to the Union\n\n          Government to evaluate the recommendations of the Expert Committee.\n\n\n15\n     2021 SCC OnLine SC 271.\n16\n     “Expert Committee”\n\n                                                                                Page 12 of 113\n\f                                                                            PART B &amp; C\n\n        The Court was informed on 16 April 2024 that the government had not taken\n\n        any decision on the recommendations of the Expert Committee. The\n\n        Constitution Bench decided to take up the reference for final hearing.\n\n\n\n\nB.    Issues\n\n\n     14. The following issues fall for the determination of this Court:\n\n     a. Whether an appointment process which allows a party who has an interest\n\n        in the dispute to unilaterally appoint a sole arbitrator, or curate a panel of\n\n        arbitrators and mandate that the other party select their arbitrator from the\n\n        panel is valid in law;\n\n     b. Whether the principle of equal treatment of parties applies at the stage of\n\n        the appointment of arbitrators; and\n\n     c. Whether an appointment process in a public-private contract which allows a\n\n        government entity to unilaterally appoint a sole arbitrator or majority of the\n\n        arbitrators of the arbitral tribunal is violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_24\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution.\n\n\nC.    Submissions\n\n\n     15. Mr Gourab Banerji, Mr Neeraj Kishan Kaul and Mr S Ravi Shankar, senior\n\n        counsel, and Mr Rohan Talwar, Mr George Poothan Poothicote and Mr\n\n        Anirurdh Krishnan, counsel, made the following submissions:\n\n     a. Party autonomy is subject to the mandatory provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_25\">Arbitration Act</a>\n\n        such as <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 18</a> (equal treatment of parties) and <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 12(5)</a>\n\n        (independence and impartiality of the arbitration proceedings). A panel of\n\n                                                                              Page 13 of 113\n\f                                                                          PART C\n\n   potential arbitrators unilaterally controlled by one party suffers from a lack of\n\n   independence and impartiality;\n\nb. An arbitration clause that gives one party the power to appoint a sole\n\n   arbitrator will give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias concerning the\n\n   independence and impartiality of the tribunal. The test to determine the\n\n   existence of reasonable apprehension of bias is that of a reasonable third\n\n   person;\n\nc. <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_28\">Section 12(5)</a> overrides an arbitration agreement because of the non\n\n   obstante clause. Although the statute does not specifically bar an ineligible\n\n   person from appointing an arbitrator, TRF (supra) and Perkins (supra)\n\n   rightly held that an ineligible person could not appoint an arbitrator or curate\n\n   a panel of arbitrators. The thread running through TRF (supra) and Perkins\n\n   (supra) is that if a person has an interest in the outcome of the dispute, such\n\n   person should not have any role in the process of appointing an arbitrator,\n\n   including curation of a panel of potential arbitrators;\n\nd. TRF (supra) and Perkins (supra) only carved out an exception for situations\n\n   where both parties are permitted to appoint an arbitrator of their choice;\n\ne. A unilaterally appointed panel is contrary to the principle of equal treatment\n\n   of parties enshrined under <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_29\">Section 18</a>, which is a mandatory provision.\n\n   Although <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 18</a> is part of Chapter V dealing with the conduct of arbitral\n\n   proceedings, it also applies at the stage of the constitution of arbitral\n\n   tribunals. A lack of mutuality in the appointment process is a violation of\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_31\">Section 18</a> because it gives an unfair advantage to one party;\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      Page 14 of 113\n\f                                                                                   PART C\n\n      f. In Lombardi Engineering Limited v. Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam\n\n           Limited,17 this Court held that arbitration agreements must conform with the\n\n           Constitution. An arbitration clause authorizing one party to unilaterally\n\n           appoint an arbitrator or curate a panel of arbitrators is unconscionable and\n\n           violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_32\">Article 14.</a> <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_33\">Section 23</a> of the Indian Contract Act 187218 also\n\n           prohibits unconscionable contracts;\n\n      g. In Voestalpine (supra), this Court directed the constitution of a broad-based\n\n           panel of arbitrators. However, the constitution of such a panel restricts the\n\n           choice of the other party and falls foul of the requirement of equality and\n\n           impartiality; and\n\n      h. CORE (supra) does not consider Voestalpine (supra), <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_34\">Section 11(8)</a>, and\n\n           the principle of an independence and impartiality under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_35\">Section 12</a>. Further,\n\n           the counter-balancing test evolved in Perkins (supra) is only applicable in\n\n           situations where both parties have an equal and unfettered choice in\n\n           appointing their arbitrators. It does not apply to situations where one party’s\n\n           choice of arbitrators is restricted to a pre-selected list by the other party; and\n\n      i.   The prohibition on a person ineligible under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 12(5)</a> from nominating\n\n           an arbitrator or a panel of arbitrators can be traced to <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_37\">Section 18</a>. Further, if\n\n           the panel of arbitrators is curated and controlled by one party, it gives rise to\n\n           “justifiable doubts” as to the independence and impartiality of the arbitrator\n\n           under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_38\">Section 12</a>.\n\n\n\n\n17\n     [2023] 13 SCR 943\n18\n     “<a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_39\">Contract Act</a>”\n\n                                                                               Page 15 of 113\n\f                                                                          PART C\n\n16. Mr Tushar Mehta, Solicitor General of India, Mr K M Nataraj, Additional\n\n   Solicitor General of India, Mr Arvind Kamath, Additional Solicitor General of\n\n   India, Mr Mahesh Jethmalani, Ms Madhavi Divan, Mr Guru Krishna Kumar,\n\n   Mr Anand Padmanabhan, Mr Naresh Kaushik, Mr Nakul Dewan, Mr P V\n\n   Dinesh, senior counsel, and Mr Shashank Garg, counsel, made the\n\n   following submissions:\n\na. The principle of party autonomy is ingrained in the entire architecture of the\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_40\">Arbitration Act</a>. <a href=\"/doc/206503/\" id=\"a_41\">Section 11(2)</a> allows the parties to agree on a procedure for\n\n   appointing arbitrators. The procedure contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/206503/\" id=\"a_42\">Section 11(2)</a> can\n\n   include one party preparing a panel of arbitrators and giving a choice to the\n\n   other party to select its nominee from the panel;\n\nb. The duty of the Supreme Court or the High Court to appoint an independent\n\n   and impartial arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_43\">Section 11(8)</a> arises only in situations\n\n   contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/712376/\" id=\"a_44\">Sections 11(4)</a>, <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_45\">11(5)</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_46\">11(6)</a> where parties fail to\n\n   abide by the agreed procedure. The provision does not hinder the right of\n\n   the parties to agree on a procedure for appointment of arbitrators under\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/206503/\" id=\"a_47\">Section 11(2)</a>;\n\nc. The action of “appointing” or “enlisting” a person as an arbitrator is distinct\n\n   from “acting” as an arbitrator. <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_48\">Section 12(5)</a> expressly prohibits a person who\n\n   is ineligible in terms of the Seventh Schedule from being appointed as an\n\n   arbitrator. However, the Arbitration Act does not expressly prohibit such an\n\n   ineligible person from appointing an arbitrator or enlisting a panel of potential\n\n   arbitrators;\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      Page 16 of 113\n\f                                                                         PART C\n\nd. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_49\">The Arbitration Act</a> does not recognize any presumed ineligibility concerning\n\n   arbitrators. The ineligibility must be real and actual according to <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_50\">Section 12</a>;\n\ne. The equality of treatment under <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_51\">Section 18</a> does not refer to inter se equality\n\n   between the parties at the stage of agreeing upon a procedure for appointing\n\n   an arbitrator. <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_52\">Section 18</a> mandates the arbitral tribunal to treat the parties\n\n   with equality and give them a full opportunity to present their case. Further,\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_53\">Section 18</a> only applies after the composition of the arbitral tribunal during\n\n   the conduct of arbitral proceedings;\n\nf. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_54\">The Arbitration Act</a> provides adequate statutory safeguards for securing the\n\n   independence and impartiality of arbitrators. These safeguards include: (i)\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_55\">Section 12(5)</a> read the Seventh Schedule; (ii) mandatory disclosure under\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_56\">Sections 12(1)</a> read with the Fifth Schedule; (iii) challenge procedures under\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_57\">Sections 13</a> and <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_58\">14</a>; and (iv) judicial review of the decision of an arbitrator\n\n   under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_59\">Section 34</a>;\n\ng. Voestalpine (supra) has upheld the maintenance of a panel of potential\n\n   arbitrators by public sector undertakings. It correctly laid down the broad-\n\n   based principle for the operation of a panel of arbitrators. Further, it did not\n\n   bar former employees of the parties to the arbitration agreement from\n\n   serving as arbitrators;\n\nh. TRF (supra) erred by relying on the maxim qui facit per alium facit per se\n\n   which is usually applied in the context of delegation of authority. The act of\n\n   appointing or nominating an arbitrator under an arbitration clause is not an\n\n   act of delegation of the appointing authority’s power. Rather, the arbitrator\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      Page 17 of 113\n\f                                                                                                     PART D\n\n         exercises an independent power of adjudication within the limits laid down\n\n         by the pertinent arbitration agreement and the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_60\">Arbitration Act</a>; and\n\n     i. Non-banking financial companies19 include arbitration clauses in the\n\n         standard form contracts entered into with the borrowers. Since the nature of\n\n         the dispute generally involves default in payment by the borrowers, the\n\n         arbitration clause allows the NBFCs to appoint an arbitrator. Nevertheless,\n\n         the arbitrator has to satisfy the criteria laid down under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_61\">Section 12</a>.\n\n\nD.     Principles underpinning the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_62\">Arbitration Act</a>\n\n\n     17. Our courts have jurisdiction to try all suits of a civil nature except where\n\n         cognizance is expressly or impliedly barred.20 <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_63\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act\n\n         bars any agreement that prohibits parties from enforcing their rights under\n\n         contract by usual legal proceedings in ordinary tribunals. However, the\n\n         provision makes an exception to a contract by which two or more persons\n\n         agree to refer the disputes that may arise between them in respect of any\n\n         subject or class of subjects to arbitration.21 Thus, parties can contract out of\n\n\n19\n    “NBFCs”\n20\n    <a href=\"/doc/76869205/\" id=\"a_64\">Section 9</a>, Code of Civil Procedure 1908.

It brings the domestic arbitration law in consonance with the\n\n         UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration 1985.22 One\n\n         of the main objectives of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_67\">Arbitration Act</a> is to make provision for an\n\n         arbitral procedure that is fair, efficient and capable of meeting the needs of\n\n         the specific arbitration.\n\n    19. <a href=\"/doc/651072/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 2A</a> of the Model Law enunciates the following principles to interpret\n\n         the provisions of national arbitration laws: (i) regard for the arbitration law’s\n\n         international origin; (ii) the need to promote uniformity in its application; and\n\n         (iii) observance of good faith. It further provides that issues not expressly\n\n         settled under the arbitration law are to be settled in conformity with the\n\n         “general principles” on which the law is based.23\n\n    20. The principles of interpretation suggested by the Model Law require courts\n\n         to assume a global perspective consistent with the prevailing practice in\n\n         courts of other jurisdictions and arbitral tribunals.24 The Model Law\n\n\n\n\nthem which has already arisen, or affect any provision of any law in force for the time being as to references\nto arbitration.\n22\n   “Model Law”\n23\n   Article 2<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_69\">A, Arbitration Act</a>. [It reads:\n“Article 2A International origin and general principles\n(1) In the interpretation of this Law, regard is to be had to its international origin and to the need to promote\nuniformity in its application and the observance of good faith.\n(2) Questions concerning matters governed by this Law which are not expressly settled in it are to be settled\nin conformity with the general principles on which this Law is based.”]\n24\n   Ilias Bantekas, ‘International Origin and General Principles’ in UNCITRAL Model Law on International\nCommercial Arbitration: A Commentary (Cambridge University Press, 2020) 44.\n\n                                                                                                Page 19 of 113\n\f                                                                                                 PART D\n\n        encourages resort to “general principles” to fill the gaps in the national\n\n        arbitration laws.25 The term “general principles” is intended to refer to\n\n        principles widely accepted by legal systems.26 The above principles of\n\n        interpretation will also apply when interpreting the provisions of the\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_70\">Arbitration Act</a>.\n\n       i.      Party autonomy\n\n\n     21. <a href=\"/doc/1737370/\" id=\"a_71\">Section 7</a> defines an arbitration agreement to mean an agreement by the\n\n        parties to submit to arbitration all or certain disputes which have arisen or\n\n        which may arise between them in respect of a defined legal relationship,\n\n        whether contractual or not. The arbitration agreement records the consent\n\n        of the parties to submit their disputes to arbitration.27 Arbitration is premised\n\n            on a consensual agreement to submit disputes to (a) a decision-maker\n\n            chosen by or for the parties; (b) to render a binding resolution of the dispute\n\n            following adjudicatory procedures which afford the parties an opportunity to\n\n            be heard. The right to arbitrate is a private right of the parties to adjudicate\n\n            in personam disputes.\n\n     22. The basis of any arbitration is the freedom of the parties to agree to submit\n\n            their disputes to an individual or to a panel of individuals whose judgment\n\n            they are prepared to trust and obey. Party autonomy is fundamental to\n\n            international commercial arbitration because it allows the parties to design\n\n            the arbitration proceedings to suit their needs and commercial reality.

The principle of minimum judicial\n\n        interference supplements the autonomy of parties by prohibiting courts from\n\n        interfering in arbitral proceedings unless mandated by the law.30 This\n\n        principle respects the autonomy of the parties to mutually chart the course\n\n        of the arbitral proceedings.\n\n     23. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_72\">The Arbitration Act</a> has given pre-eminence to party autonomy throughout\n\n        the arbitral process. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_73\">The Arbitration Act</a> has used phrases such as “unless\n\n        otherwise agreed by the parties”31, “failing any agreement”32, “the parties are\n\n        free to agree”33, “failing such agreement”34, and “unless the agreement on\n\n        the appointment procedure provides other means”35 to recognise the\n\n        autonomy of parties to determine the arbitral proceedings. The use of the\n\n        above phrases also indicates that an arbitrator is bound by the procedures\n\n        agreed upon between the parties.36\n\n     24.

Secondly, there are\na number of provisions granting freedom to the parties, accompanied by suppletive rules failing agreement\nby the parties; here the question of mandatory nature seems to be a philosophical one and equally redundant.\nThirdly, with respect to some draft articles only a part of the provisions (e.g. a time limit) is non-mandatory.\nFourthly, in respect of some of the provisions already decided to be non-mandatory, the Working Group was\nof the view that this should, for the sake of emphasis, be expressed in the individual provision, despite the\ngeneral listing in <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_143\">article 3.</a> Fifthly, it is suggested that, in addition to the provisions already decided to be non-\nmandatory and drafted accordingly, […] there are only few further provisions which may be regarded as non-\nmandatory and, if so, could be easily marked as such by adding the words “unless otherwise agreed by the\nparties;”]\n57\n   Holtzmann and Neuhaus (supra) 198\n\n                                                                                                   Page 25 of 113\n\f                                                                                                   PART D\n\n    31. The above extract suggests that an arbitration agreement entered into by\n\n        the parties is subject to certain well-defined and mandatory legal principles.\n\n        For instance, <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_144\">Section 34(2)(a)(v)</a> allows for refusal of enforcement of arbitral\n\n        awards if the composition of the arbitral tribunal or arbitral procedure was\n\n        not following the agreement of the parties unless such agreement conflicts\n\n        with the mandatory provisions of the law.58 The composition of the arbitral\n\n        tribunal or the arbitral procedure must not only be in accordance with the\n\n        agreement of the parties but also be consistent with the mandatory\n\n        standards laid down under the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_145\">Arbitration Act</a>.59 In case of a conflict,\n\n        mandatory provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_146\">Arbitration Act</a> prevail over the arbitration\n\n        agreement between the parties.60\n\n    32. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_147\">Under the Arbitration Act</a>, the mandatory provisions must be deduced from\n\n        their content. For instance, the use of the phrase “unless otherwise agreed\n\n        by the parties” is an indicator of the fact that the provision is derogable\n\n        because it gives priority to the agreement of the parties. In contrast, the use\n\n        of the word “shall” in a provision is an indicator that the legislature intended\n\n        to give it a mandatory effect. However, the use of “shall” is not the sole\n\n        indicator to determine the mandatory nature of a provision.

Most international arbitration statutes give\n\n        primacy to the agreement of parties for the constitution of the arbitral\n\n        tribunal.69 The genesis of this international consensus could be traced to the\n\n        Geneva Protocol on Arbitration Clauses 1923 which stated that the “arbitral\n\n        procedure, including the constitution of the arbitral tribunal, shall be\n\n        governed by the will of the parties and by the law of the country in whose\n\n        territory the arbitration takes place.”70\n\n     37.

For\n\n           instance, if the agreement only allows a professional of a particular class\n\n           such as a chartered accountant to serve as an arbitrator, the appointing\n\n           court should normally abide by this requirement. However, while appointing\n\n           an arbitrator following the agreed qualifications, the appointing court must\n\n           also have due regard for considerations that are likely to secure an\n\n           independent and impartial tribunal. <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 11(8)</a> imposes a duty on the\n\n           appointing court to ensure the appointment of an independent and impartial\n\n           arbitrator.\n\n       39. <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 11</a> is based on <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_170\">Article 11</a> of the Model Law. The draft text of the\n\n           Model Law contained a provision which invalidated an arbitration agreement\n\n           if it accorded a predominant position or unfair advantage to one party in the\n\n           appointment of the arbitrator. The provision is extracted below:\n\n                         “An arbitration agreement is invalid [if] [to the extent\n                         that] it accords one of the parties a [predominant\n                         position] [manifestly unfair advantage] with regard to\n                         the appointment of arbitrators.”71\n\n\n\n       40.

Public-private arbitration\n\n\n     56. Private law is a part of common law which involves relationships between\n\n           individuals by way of contract or tort.97 The demands of the modern market\n\n           economy require the State to contract out certain public tasks to private\n\n           entities. The procurement of goods and services is among the most common\n\n           forms of government contracting with private providers.98 Indian law does\n\n           not provide a special regime governing contracts by public authorities.\n\n           Generally, the resolution of disputes arising out of the contractual terms of a\n\n           public-private contract is subject to ordinary civil law remedies.99 Arbitration\n\n           is one of the preferred private dispute resolution mechanisms adopted in\n\n        public-private contracts.\n\n     57. An arbitration involving a company owned or controlled by government\n\n        would likely involve public interest, considering the impact of an arbitral\n\n           award on public finances. However, the Arbitration Act does not make a\n\n           distinction between public-private arbitrations and private arbitrations. This\n\n           lack of differentiation also extends to other aspects of arbitration including\n\n           appointment of arbitrators, conduct of arbitration proceedings, and setting\n\n           aside and enforcement of arbitral awards.100 Since the grounds for setting\n\n           aside an arbitral award have been narrowly framed, the thrust of this\n\n           privately ordered legal system is on the decision made by the arbitral\n\n           tribunal. Moreover, the Arbitration Act mandates the arbitration proceedings\n\n\n97\n   K K Saksena v.

In Pam Developments Private Limited v. State of West Bengal101, the\n\n          arbitrator made an award in favour of the contractor. When the contractor\n\n          sought to enforce the award, the State government obtained a stay by\n\n          relying on Order XXVII Rule 8-A <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_247\">of the Code of Civil Procedure</a> 1908.102 This\n\n          Court held that since the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_248\">Arbitration Act</a> is a self-contained code, the\n\n          provisions <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_249\">of the CPC</a> “will apply only insofar as the same are not\n\n          inconsistent with the spirit and provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_250\">Arbitration Act</a>.” Noting that\n\n          no special treatment can be given to the government under the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_251\">Arbitration\n\n          Act</a>, the Court observed:\n\n                     “26.

An arbitrator’s relationship with parties is contractual. The rights and\n\n         obligations of an arbitrator are principally the result of the contractual\n\n         relations with the parties.107 However, the position under common law is that\n\n         the rights and duties of an arbitrator are derived from a conjunction of\n\n         contract and quasi-judicial status granted by national laws. In Norjarl v.\n\n         Hyundai Heavy Industries, Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed that it is\n\n         impossible to distinguish contractual matters from those of quasi-judicial\n\n         status.108 Similarly, in ONGC v.

An arbitral tribunal performs a quasi-judicial function because it substantially\n\n         determines the rights and liabilities of competing parties through\n\n         adjudicative means.110 The tribunal is generally required to arrive at\n\n         decisions or awards based on procedural and substantive law. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_267\">The\n\n         Arbitration Act</a> allows flexibility to parties to select the procedural and\n\n         substantive law to be followed by the arbitral tribunal. During the arbitration\n\n         process, the arbitral tribunal generally meets at a place agreed upon by the\n\n         parties, considers the statement of claim and defence, conducts oral\n\n         hearings, and may appoint experts.

Although the Arbitration Act recognizes the autonomy of parties to decide on\n\n         all aspects of arbitration, it also lays down a procedural framework to\n\n         regulate the composition of the arbitral tribunal and conduct of arbitral\n\n         proceedings. The incorporation of <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_274\">Section 12(5)</a> is a recognition of the well-\n\n         established principle that quasi-judicial proceedings should be conducted\n\n         consistent with the principles of natural justice. <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_275\">Section 18</a> serves as a\n\n         guide for arbitral tribunals to follow the principles of equality and fairness\n\n         during the conduct of arbitral proceedings. Thus, the Arbitration Act requires\n\n         the arbitral tribunals to act judicially in determining              disputes between\n\n         parties.114\n\n      64. Since arbitral proceedings have “trappings of a court”, the law requires\n\n         arbitral tribunals to act objectively and “exercise their discretion in a judicial\n\n         manner, without caprice, and according to the general principles of law and\n\n         rules of natural justice.”115 An arbitral award can be set aside if the\n\n         composition of the arbitral tribunal or the arbitral procedure violates the\n\n         mandatory provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_276\">Arbitration Act</a>, including <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_277\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_278\">18</a>.\n\n         Thus, the Arbitration Act emphasizes that the substance of the law cannot\n\n         be divorced from the procedure.\n\n\n\n\n113\n    <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_279\">Section 16</a>, Arbitration Act\n114\n    Engineering Mazdoor Sabha v.

Arbitral tribunals serve as effective alternatives to traditional justice\n\n         dispensing mechanisms. The purpose of                            arbitral tribunals is to be\n\n         expeditious where the law is slow, cheap where the law is costly, simple\n\n         where the law is technical, and a peace-maker instead of a stirrer up of\n\n         strife.119 Arbitral tribunals can inspire confidence in their adjudicatory\n\n         process by conducting fair and impartial hearings and providing sufficient\n\n         and cogent reasons for their decisions.120 Given the adjudicatory functions\n\n\n\n\n116\n    <a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_281\">Section 31</a>, Arbitration Act\n117\n    Siemens Engg. &amp; Mfg.

[…] If courts of law are to be replaced by administrative authorities and\ntribunals, as indeed, in some kinds of cases, with the proliferation of Administrative Law, they may have to\nbe so replaced, it is essential that administrative authorities and tribunals should accord fair and proper\nhearing to the persons sought to be affected by their orders and give sufficiently clear and explicit reasons in\nsupport of the orders made by them. Then alone administrative authorities and tribunals exercising quasi-\njudicial function will be able to justify their existence and carry credibility with the people by inspiring\nconfidence in the adjudicatory process. The rule requiring reasons to be given in support of an order is, like\nthe principle of audi alteram partem, a basic principle of natural justice which must inform every quasi-judicial\nprocess and this rule must be observed in its proper spirit and mere pretence of compliance with it would not\nsatisfy the requirement of law.]\n\n                                                                                                Page 47 of 113\n\f                                                                                                    PART E\n\n             performed by arbitral tribunals, the decisions which emanate from them\n\n             must be grounded in a process that is independent and impartial.\n\n       ii.

The first part of <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_287\">Section 18</a> provides that “parties shall be treated with\n\n         equality.” The broad nature of the prescription has to be complied with not\n\n         only by arbitral tribunals, but also by parties while giving expression to party\n\n         autonomy. The principle has to be followed in all procedural contexts of\n\n         arbitral proceedings, including the stage of appointment of arbitrators.125\n\n         According to Peter Binder, the principle of equal treatment of parties “means\n\n         that no party may be given preference in the arbitrator-selection process\n\n\n121\n    Associate Builders v.

The concept of equality under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_303\">Article 14</a> enshrines the principle of equality\n\n         of treatment. The basic principle underlying <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_304\">Article 14</a> is that the law must\n\n         operate equally on all persons under like circumstances.132 The implication\n\n         of equal treatment in the context of judicial adjudication is that “all litigants\n\n         similarly situated are entitled to avail themselves of the same procedural\n\n         rights for relief, and for defence with like protection and without\n\n         discrimination.”133 In Union of India v.

Thus, the constitutional norm\n\n         of procedural equality is a necessary concomitant to a fair and impartial\n\n         adjudicatory process.\n\n      71. Arbitration is an adversarial system. It relies on the parties to produce facts\n\n         and evidence before the arbitral tribunal to render a decision. Procedural\n\n         equality is generally considered to contain the following indicia: (i) equal\n\n         capability of parties to produce facts and legal arguments; (ii) equal\n\n         opportunities to parties to present their case; and (iii) neutrality of the\n\n         adjudicator.135 In an adversarial process, formal equality is important\n\n         because it helps secure legitimate adjudicative outcomes and create a level\n\n         playing field between parties.136\n\n      72. The defining characteristic of arbitration law (particularly ad hoc arbitration)\n\n         is that it allows freedom to the parties to select their arbitrators. This is unlike\n\n         domestic courts or tribunals where the parties have to litigate their claims\n\n         before a pre-selected and randomly allocated Bench of judges. <a href=\"/doc/206503/\" id=\"a_306\">Section\n\n         11(2)</a> of the Arbitration Act allows parties to agree on a procedure for\n\n         appointing the arbitrators. The “procedure” contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/206503/\" id=\"a_307\">Section\n\n         11(2)</a> is a set of actions which parties undertake in their endeavour to\n\n         appoint arbitrators to adjudicate their dispute independently and impartially.\n\n         Without formal equality at the stage of appointment of arbitrators, a party\n\n\n\n135\n    Jerry L Mashaw, ‘The Supreme Court’s Due Process Calculus for Administrative Adjudication in Mathews\nv Eldridge: Three Factors in Search of a Theory of Value’ (1976) 44(28) University of Chicago Law Review\n29, 52.

In a quasi-judicial process such as arbitration, the\n\n         appointment of an independent and impartial arbitrator ensures procedural\n\n         equality between parties during the arbitral proceedings. This is also\n\n         recognised under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_308\">Section 11(8)</a> which requires the appointing authority to\n\n         appoint independent and impartial arbitrators.\n\n      73. The 2015 amendment has introduced concrete standards of impartiality and\n\n         independence of arbitrators. One of the facets of impartiality is procedural\n\n         impartiality. Procedural impartiality implies that the rules constitutive of the\n\n         decision-making process must favour neither party to the dispute or favour\n\n         or inhibit both parties equally.137 Further, a procedurally impartial\n\n         adjudication entails equal participation of parties in all aspects of\n\n         adjudication for the process to approach legitimacy.138 Participation in the\n\n         adjudicatory process is meaningless for a party against whom the arbitrator\n\n         is already prejudiced.139 Equal participation of parties in the process of\n\n         appointment of arbitrators ensures that both sides have an equal say in the\n\n         establishment of a genuinely independent and impartial arbitral process.\n\n      74.

Thus, participation\nthrough reasoned argument loses its meaning if the arbiter of the dispute is inaccessible to reason because\nhe is insane, has been bribed, or is hopelessly prejudiced.”]\n\n                                                                                                    Page 52 of 113\n\f                                                                                               PART F\n\n         have to challenge the independence or impartiality of the arbitrator or\n\n         arbitrators in terms of <a href=\"/doc/135168/\" id=\"a_311\">Section 12(3)</a> before the same arbitral tribunal under\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_312\">Section 13</a>.140 If the tribunal rejects the challenge, it has to continue with the\n\n         arbitral proceedings and make an award. Such an award can always be\n\n         challenged under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_313\">Section 34</a>. However, considerable time and expenses are\n\n         incurred by the parties by the time the award is set aside by the courts. Equal\n\n         participation of parties at the stage of the appointment of arbitrators can thus\n\n         obviate later challenges to arbitrators.\n\n      75. Independence and impartiality of arbitral proceedings and equality of parties\n\n         are concomitant principles. The independence and impartiality of arbitral\n\n         proceedings can be effectively enforced only if the parties can participate\n\n         equally at all stages of an arbitral process. Therefore, the principle of equal\n\n         treatment of parties applies at all stages of arbitral proceedings, including\n\n         the stage of the appointment of arbitrators.\n\n\nF.     Nemo judex rule and the doctrine of bias\n\n\n      76. The principles of natural justice principally consist of two rules: (i) no one\n\n         shall be a judge in their own cause (nemo judex in causa sua); and (ii) no\n\n         decision shall be given against a party without affording a reasonable\n\n         opportunity of being heard.141 Adherence to the principles of natural justice\n\n         is a facet of procedural fairness.

The intrinsic function values natural justice as an end in itself. It\n\n             values natural justice as an essential feature of fairness. In its instrumental\n\n             element, natural justice is viewed as a means to achieving just outcomes.\n\n      77. The principle of nemo judex is based on the precept that justice should not\n\n             only be done but manifestly and undoubtedly be seen to be done.145 The\n\n             principle of nemo judex applies to judicial, quasi-judicial, and administrative\n\n             proceedings.146 An adjudicator should be disinterested and unbiased.147 A\n\n         bias is a predisposition to decide for or against one party, without proper\n\n         regard to the true merits of the dispute.148\n\n        i.

Tulsiram Patel,156 a Constitution Bench of this Court\n\n         observed that violation of the principles of natural justice results in\n\n         arbitrariness:\n\n                            “95. The principles of natural justice have thus come\n                            to be recognized as being a part of the guarantee\n                            contained in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_319\">Article 14</a> because of the new and\n                            dynamic interpretation given by this Court to the\n                            concept of equality which is the subject-matter of\n                            that article.

Union of India,161 this Court held that the\n\n         requirement of procedural fairness “holds an inherent value in itself.” It was\n\n         further observed:\n\n                           “42. Inherent value in fair procedure: Fair procedure\n                           is not only a means to the end of achieving a fair\n                           outcome but is an end it itself. Fair procedure\n                           induces equality in the proceedings. The\n                           proceedings ‘seem’ to be and are seen to be fair.”\n\n\n\n      81.

Thus, the\n\n          resolution of disputes arising in a private contractual relationship is subject\n\n          to certain inherent principles which a quasi-judicial body like an arbitral\n\n          tribunal is required to adhere to. Resolution of private disputes following the\n\n              minimum statutory standards of equality and fairness is essential not only in\n\n              the interest of justice, but also to uphold the integrity of arbitration in India.\n\n        ii.      Doctrine of bias\n\n\n       82. In A K Kraipak v. Union of India,162 the Central Government constituted a\n\n          Special Selection Board for selecting officers to the Indian Forest Service in\n\n          the senior scale and junior scale from the serving officers of the Forest\n\n          department of the State of Jammu and Kashmir. One of the members of the\n\n          selection board was the officiating Chief Conservator of Forests of Jammu\n\n          and Kashmir. However, the Chief Conservator was also one of the\n\n          candidates in contention for the posts in the Indian Forest Service. Although\n\n          the Chief Conservator was not present when his name was considered for\n\n          selection by the board, he was present and participated in the deliberations\n\n          when the names of other candidates were being considered.\n\n       83. The Constitution Bench held that the real question was not whether the Chief\n\n          Conservator was biased, but whether there was a reasonable ground for\n\n          believing that he was likely to have been biased. It was observed that a\n\n\n\n162\n      (1969) 2 SCC 262\n\n                                                                                   Page 57 of 113\n\f                                                                                                   PART F\n\n         reasonable likelihood of bias has to be determined by taking into\n\n         consideration human probabilities and the ordinary course of human\n\n         conduct.163 It was observed that the Chief Conservator had an interest in\n\n         keeping his rivals out and securing the position for himself. Further, it was\n\n         held that the other members of the selection board would have been\n\n         influenced by the Chief Conservator’s opinion about other candidates.\n\n         Resultantly, this Court struck down the entire selection made by the board.\n\n      84. In J Mohapatra v. State of Orissa,164 the State government had constituted\n\n         a committee to select books for general reading to be kept in school and\n\n         college libraries. For the years 1980 to 1982, the committee selected and\n\n         purchased books in a prescribed manner. The list of books prepared by the\n\n         committee was challenged before the High Court. One of the grounds of\n\n         challenge was that some of the members of the committee were themselves\n\n         authors of books that were selected and purchased. The High Court rejected\n\n         the challenge on two grounds: (i) the decision of the committee was subject\n\n         to the approval of the State government; and (ii) the role played by an\n\n         individual member of the committee was insignificant and could not have\n\n         influenced the decision of the committee.\n\n\n163\n    A K Kraipak (supra) [15]. [15. […] But then the very fact that he was a member of the selection board must\nhave had its own impact on the decision of the selection board. Further admittedly he participated in the\ndeliberations of the selection board when the claims of his rivals particularly that of Basu was considered.\nHe was also party to the preparation of the list of selected candidates in order of preference. At every stage\nof his participation in the deliberations of the selection board there was a conflict between his interest and\nduty. Under those circumstances it is difficult to believe that he could have been impartial. The real question\nis not whether he was biased. It is difficult to prove the state of mind of a person. Therefore what we have to\nsee is whether there is reasonable ground for believing that he was likely to have been biased. We agree\nwith the learned Attorney General that a mere suspicion of bias is not sufficient. There must be a reasonable\nlikelihood of bias. In deciding the question of bias we have to take into consideration human probabilities and\nordinary course of human conduct. It was in the interest of Naqishbund to keep out his rivals in order to\nsecure his position from further challenge. Naturally he was also interested in safeguarding his position while\npreparing the list of selected candidates.]\n164\n    (1984) 4 SCC 103\n\n                                                                                              Page 58 of 113\n\f                                                                             PART F\n\n85. This Court observed that a person who has written a book that is submitted\n\n   for selection has an interest in the matter of selection. It was further\n\n   observed that there is a direct correlation between the selection of books by\n\n   the committee and an increase in sales of the books. The increased sales\n\n   resulted in increased royalties for the authors. Therefore, it was held that an\n\n   author benefits financially if their book is selected by the committee. This\n\n   Court further disagreed with the finding of the High Court that the author-\n\n   member had an insignificant role in the book selection process, by\n\n   observing:\n\n                 “11. […] to say that such author-member is only one\n                 of the members of the Assessment Sub-Committee\n                 is to overlook the fact that the author-member can\n                 subtly influence the minds of the other members\n                 against selecting books by other authors in\n                 preference to his own. It can also be that books by\n                 some of the other members may also have been\n                 submitted for selection and there can be between\n                 them a quid pro quo or, in other words, you see that\n                 my book is selected and in return I will do the same\n                 for you. In either case, when a book of an author-\n                 member comes up for consideration, the other\n                 members would feel themselves embarrassed in\n                 frankly discussing its merits. Such author-member\n                 may also be a person holding a high official position\n                 whom the other members may not want to displease.\n                 It can be that the other members may not be\n                 influenced by the fact that the book which they are\n                 considering for approval was written by one of their\n                 members. Whether they were so influenced or not is,\n                 however, a matter impossible to determine. It is not,\n                 therefore, the actual bias in favour of the author-\n                 member that is material but the possibility of\n                 such bias.”\n\n\n\n\n                                               (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n                                                                         Page 59 of 113\n\f                                                                                              PART F\n\n      86. In J Mohapatra (supra), it was observed that a decision-maker who is\n\n        prejudiced can possibly influence the decision of the authority in tangible\n\n        and intangible ways. This Court recognized that the doctrine of necessity\n\n        serves as an exception to the nemo judex rule. An adjudicator, who is subject\n\n        to disqualification on the ground of bias or interest in the matter which he\n\n        has to decide, may be required to adjudicate in three situations: (i) if there\n\n        is no other person who is competent or authorized to adjudicate; (ii) if a\n\n        quorum cannot be formed without him; or (iii) if no other competent tribunal\n\n        can be constituted.\n\n      87. In Ashok Kumar Yadav v. State of Haryana,165 some members of the\n\n        selection committee of the Haryana Public Service Commission were\n\n        related to the candidates who appeared for the viva voce examination.\n\n        Although the members did not participate when their relatives were being\n\n        interviewed, they participated in the interviews of other candidates. The\n\n        court observed that the test “is not that the decision is actually tainted with\n\n        bias, but that the circumstances are such as to create a reasonable\n\n        apprehension in the mind of others that there is a likelihood of bias affecting\n\n        the decision.” The Court observed that the nemo judex rule extends to all\n\n        cases where an independent mind has to be applied to arrive at a fair and\n\n        just decision between rival claims of parties. However, the court resorted to\n\n        the doctrine of necessity to hold that the decision of the state Public Service\n\n        Commission, being a constitutional authority, was not vitiated.166\n\n\n165\n   (1985) 4 SCC 417\n166\n   Ashok Kumar Yadav (supra) [18].

The principle governing the doctrine of bias is that a member of a judicial\n\n            body with a predisposition in favour of or against any party to a dispute or\n\n            whose position in relation to the subject matter or a disputing party is such\n\n            that a lack of impartiality would be assumed to exist should not be a part of\n\n            a tribunal composed to decide the dispute.167 This principle is applicable to\n\n            authorities who have to act judicially in deciding rights and liabilities and\n\n        bodies discharging quasi-judicial functions. A quasi-judicial authority\n\n            empowered to decide a dispute between opposing parties “must be one\n\n            without bias towards one side or the other in the dispute.”168 A member of a\n\n            tribunal which is called upon to try issues in judicial or quasi-judicial\n\n            proceedings must act impartially, objectively, and without bias.169\n\n     iii.

Bias is generally classified under three heads: (i) legal interest, which means\n\n            a judge is “in such a position that a bias must be assumed”; (ii) pecuniary\n\n            interest; and (iii) personal bias.170 A pecuniary or proprietary interest,\n\n            however small, automatically disqualifies a person.171 A person who has an\n\n\nof the Selection Committee or withdraw from it leaving it to the appointing authority to nominate another\nperson in his place, need be applied in case of a constitutional authority like the Public Service Commission,\nwhether Central or State. If a member of a Public Service Commission were to withdraw altogether from the\nselection process on the ground that a close relative of his is appearing for selection, no other person save\na member can be substituted in his place. And it may sometimes happen that no other member is available\nto take the place of such member and the functioning of the Public Service Commission may be affected.]\n167\n    Gullapalli Nageswara Rao v.

The House\n\n        of Lords observed that the principle that no person should be judge in their\n\n        own cause “is not to be confined to a cause in which he is a party, but applies\n\n        to a cause in which he has an interest.”175.\n\n      90.

Lord Hoffman was one of the five members who agreed\n\n        with the majority.

Resultantly, the House of Lords set aside its previous\n\n         decision and directed a rehearing of the matter.\n\n      91. Lord Browne-Wilkinson observed that AI and AICL were all “parts of an entity\n\n         or movement” working in different fields to establish that Pinochet was not\n\n         immune from extradition as a former head of State. This interest of the\n\n         organizations was termed as a non-pecuniary interest to achieve a particular\n\n         result. The rationale of automatic disqualification was held to extend to\n\n         situations where a judge’s decision will lead to the promotion of a cause in\n\n         which the judge is involved with one of the parties.179 In re Pinochet (supra)\n\n         extended automatic disqualification to situations where a judge has an\n\n         interest in the cause, which is being promoted by one of the parties to the\n\n         case.\n\n           b. Real likelihood of bias\n\n      92. The nemo judex rule may be applicable where a judge’s conduct or\n\n         circumstances give rise to an apprehension of bias. In such situations, the\n\n         judge does not have a financial or cause-based interest in the outcome of\n\n         the dispute but provides benefit to a party by failing to be neutral and\n\n\n179\n    In re Pinochet (supra) [Lord Browne-Wilkinson held: “My Lords, in my judgment, although the cases have\nall dealt with automatic disqualification on the grounds of pecuniary interest, there is no good reason in\nprinciple for so limiting automatic disqualification. The rationale of the whole rule is that a man cannot be a\njudge in his own cause. In civil litigation the matters in issue will normally have an economic impact; therefore\na judge is automatically disqualified if he stands to make a financial gain as a consequence of his own\ndecision of the case. But if, as in the present case, the matter at issue does not relate to money or economic\nadvantage but is concerned with the promotion of the cause, the rationale disqualifying a judge applies just\nas much if the judge&#x27;s decision will lead to the promotion of a cause in which the judge is involved together\nwith one of the parties. Thus in my opinion if Lord Hoffmann had been a member of AI he would have been\nautomatically disqualified because of his non-pecuniary interest in establishing that Senator Pinochet was\nnot entitled to immunity.”]; Lord Hutton, in his concurring opinion observed: “I am of opinion that there could\nbe cases where the interest of the judge in the subject matter of the proceedings arising from his strong\ncommitment to some cause or belief or his association with a person or body involved in the proceedings\ncould shake public confidence in the administration of justice as much as a shareholding (which might be\nsmall) in a public company involved in the litigation.”]\n\n                                                                                                Page 63 of 113\n\f                                                                                 PART F\n\n           impartial. The determination of bias does not depend upon actual proof of\n\n           bias but whether there is a real possibility of bias based on the facts and\n\n           circumstances.\n\n       93. In R v. Sussex Justices,180 the applicant was charged with the offence of\n\n           dangerous driving, which involved a collision with another vehicle. The\n\n           prosecution brought a case against the applicant before the Magistrate’s\n\n           court. Simultaneously, the driver of the other vehicle also instituted civil\n\n           proceedings against the applicant. The solicitor hired by the other driver in\n\n           civil proceedings was also acting as the Magistrate’s clerk in the criminal\n\n           proceedings. At the conclusion of the evidence before the Magistrate, the\n\n           acting clerk retired with the judges to their chambers. The Magistrate\n\n           convicted the applicant without consulting the clerk. In appeal, the Divisional\n\n           Court quashed the conviction. Lord Hewart CJ held that the clerk’s\n\n           involvement in the civil proceedings made him unfit in the circumstances to\n\n           serve as clerk to the Magistrate in the criminal matter. Lord Hewart CJ\n\n           observed that the question depended not upon what actually was done but\n\n           upon what might appear to be done and the judicial proceedings will be\n\n           vitiated if there is “even a suspicion that there has been improper\n\n           interference with the course of justice.”\n\n       94. Over the course of time, the English courts have preferred the test of real\n\n           likelihood to determine bias. In R v. Barnsley Licencing Justices,181 Devlin\n\n           LJ observed that “real likelihood” depends on the impression that the court\n\n\n\n180\n      [1924] 1 KB 256\n181\n      (1960) 2 Q.B. 187\n\n                                                                             Page 64 of 113\n\f                                                                                                     PART F\n\n         gets from the circumstances in which the justices were sitting. However, in\n\n         Metropolitan Properties Company v. Lannon,182 Lord Denning expressed\n\n         the test of the real likelihood of bias as being whether a reasonable person\n\n         would think it “likely or probable” that a judge or member of a tribunal was\n\n         biased.\n\n      95. In Regina v. Gough,183 the House of Lords observed that the probability\n\n         standard laid down by Lord Denning in Metropolitan Properties (supra)\n\n         was “too rigorous a test.” It reconciled the real likelihood of bias test by\n\n         grounding it in terms of possibility rather than the probability of bias.\n\n         Therefore, it restated the test in terms of the real danger of bias:\n\n                            “[…] having ascertained the relevant circumstances,\n                            the court should ask itself whether, having regard to\n                            those circumstances, there was a real danger of bias\n                            on the part of the relevant member of the tribunal in\n                            question, in the sense that he might unfairly regard\n                            (or having regarded with favour), or disfavour, the\n                            case of a party to the issue under consideration by\n                            him.”\n\n\n\n       The House of Lords observed that the court “personifies the reasonable man”\n\n       to ascertain the relevant circumstances from the available evidence. The real\n\n       danger of the bias test was criticized by courts in other jurisdictions such as\n\n\n\n\n182\n     [1968] EWCA Civ 5 [Lord Denning observed: “It brings home this point: in considering whether there was\na real likelihood of bias, the Court does not look at the mind of the Justice himself or at the mind of the\nChairman of the Tribunal, or whoever it may be, who sits in a judicial capacity. It does not look to see if there\nwas a real likelihood that he would, or did, in fact favour one side at the expense of the other. The Court looks\nat the impression which would be given to other people. Even if he was as impartial as could be, nevertheless\nif right-minded persons would think that, in the circumstances, there was a real likelihood of bias on his part,\nthen he should not sit.”]\n183\n     [1993] UKHL 1\n\n                                                                                                Page 65 of 113\n\f                                                                                        PART F\n\n         Australia and South Africa for emphasising the court’s view of the\n\n         circumstances rather than the public perception of the bias.184\n\n       96. In Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd.,185 the Court of Appeal\n\n          observed that the test of real danger of bias could reach the same results\n\n          as the test of real possibility of bias since the court is taken to personify the\n\n          reasonable man. It further listed a few circumstances which might give rise\n\n          to real danger of bias:\n\n                           “By contrast, a real danger of bias might well be\n                           thought to arise if there were personal friendship or\n                           animosity between the judge and any member of the\n                           public involved in the case; or if the judge were\n                           closely acquainted with any member of the\n                           public involved in the case, particularly if the\n                           credibility of that individual could be significant\n                           in the decision of the case; or if, in a case where\n                           the credibility of any individual were an issue to be\n                           decided by the judge, he had in a previous case\n                           rejected the evidence of that person in such\n                           outspoken terms as to throw doubt on his ability to\n                           approach such person&#x27;s evidence with an open mind\n                           on any later occasion; or if on any question at issue\n                           in the proceedings before him the judge had\n                           expressed views, particularly in the course of the\n                           hearing, in such extreme and unbalanced terms as\n                           to throw doubt on his ability to try the issue with an\n                           objective judicial mind; or if, for any other reason,\n                           there were real ground for doubting the ability of the\n                           judge to ignore extraneous considerations,\n                           prejudices and predilections and bring an objective\n                           judgment to bear on the issues before him.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                          (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\n\n184\n      Webb v.

[…] The question is whether the fair-minded\n                            and informed observer, having considered the facts,\n                            would conclude that there was a real possibility that\n                            the tribunal was biased.”\n\n\n\n      98. The shift in the bias test in the UK has “at its core the need for the confidence\n\n         which must be inspired by the courts in a democratic society.”188 In Lawal v.\n\n         Northern Spirit Limited,189 Lord Bingham observed that a “fair-minded and\n\n         informed observer”190 will adopt a balanced approach and as “a reasonable\n\n\n\n186\n    [2001] 1 WLR 700\n187\n    [2002] 2 AC 357\n188\n    Lawal v.

The observer who is fair-minded is the sort of person who always reserves judgment on every point until\nshe has seen and fully understood both sides of the argument. She is not unduly sensitive or suspicious, as\nKirby J observed in Johnson v Johnson (2000) 201 CLR 488, 509, para 53. Her approach must not be\nconfused with that of the person who has brought the complaint. The “real possibility” test ensures that there\nis this measure of detachment. The assumptions that the complainer makes are not to be attributed to the\nobserver unless they can be justified objectively. But she is not complacent either. She knows that fairness\nrequires that a judge must be, and must be seen to be, unbiased. She knows that judges, like anybody else,\nhave their weaknesses. She will not shrink from the conclusion, if it can be justified objectively, that things\nthat they have said or done or associations that they have formed may make it difficult for them to judge the\ncase before them impartially.\n3. Then there is the attribute that the observer is “informed&quot;. It makes the point that, before she takes a\nbalanced approach to any information she is given, she will take the trouble to inform herself on all matters\nthat are relevant. She is the sort of person who takes the trouble to read the text of an article as well as the\nheadlines. She is able to put whatever she has read or seen into its overall social, political or geographical\ncontext. She is fair-minded, so she will appreciate that the context forms an important part of the material\nwhich she must consider before passing judgment.”]\n\n                                                                                               Page 67 of 113\n\f                                                                                                    PART F\n\n         member of the public is neither complacent nor unduly sensitive or\n\n         suspicious.” The above discussion shows that the bias test has undergone\n\n         significant development in the UK over the last four decades. The current\n\n         bias test in the UK is the real possibility of a bias test.\n\n      99. The real likelihood of bias test has also been applied by the UK Supreme\n\n         Court in the case of arbitral bias. In Haliburton Company v. Chubb\n\n         Bermuda Insurance Ltd.,191 the issue before the UK Supreme Court was\n\n         whether or not the UK Arbitration Act imposed a legal obligation on\n\n         arbitrators to disclose facts and circumstances known to the arbitrator which\n\n         would give rise to justifiable doubts as to their impartiality. Although the UK\n\n         Arbitration Act does not expressly impose a duty of disclosure on arbitrators\n\n         or potential arbitrators, the UK Supreme Court read the general duty under\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_327\">Section 33</a> of the legislation. <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_328\">Section 33</a> requires an arbitrator to act fairly\n\n         and impartially in conducting arbitral proceedings.192 It was held that the\n\n         statutory duty of fairness and impartiality “gives rise to an implied term in the\n\n         contract between the arbitrator and the parties” to make that disclosure.\n\n         Hence, it was held a legal obligation to disclose is encompassed within the\n\n\n\n\n191\n   [2020] UKSC 48 [52]\n192\n   UK Arbitration Act, 1996. [It reads:\n“33. General duty of the tribunal –\n(1) The tribunal shall –\n(a) act fairly and impartially as between the parties, giving each party a reasonable opportunity of putting his\ncase and dealing with that of his opponent, and\n(b) adopt procedures suitable to the circumstances of the particular case, avoiding unnecessary delay or\nexpense, so as to provide a fair means for the resolution of the matters falling to be determined.\n(2) The tribunal shall comply with that general duty in conducting the arbitral proceedings, in its decisions on\nmatters of procedure and evidence and in the exercise of all other powers conferred on it.”]\n\n                                                                                               Page 68 of 113\n\f                                                                                                      PART F\n\n         statutory obligation of fairness unless the parties have expressly or implicitly\n\n         waived their right to disclosure.193\n\n      100.        Recently, the UK Law Commission suggested that the ruling in\n\n         Haliburton (supra) has limitations because: (i) an arbitrator may not owe a\n\n         duty of disclosure to parties who may not have signed the arbitration\n\n         agreement (non-signatory parties); and (ii) a contract of appointment cannot\n\n         create a duty of disclosure before the appointment of the arbitrator.194\n\n         Therefore, the UK Law Commission has recommended codification of the\n\n         duty of disclosure to ensure that the duty applies at the pre-appointment\n\n         stage.195 There are two important distinctions between the position of law in\n\n         India and the UK: First, the UK Arbitration Act does not require an arbitrator\n\n         to be completely independent of the parties;196 and second, Section 12 of\n\n         the Indian Arbitration Act already imposes a mandatory duty of disclosure on\n\n         potential arbitrators.\n\n      101.        Other jurisdictions also apply a real possibility of bias or reasonable\n\n         apprehension of bias test to determine judicial and arbitral bias. <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_329\">Article 6</a> of\n\n\n\n\n193\n    Haliburton (supra) [78]. [“78. Unless there is a disclosure, the parties may often be unaware of matters\nwhich could give rise to justifiable doubts about an arbitrator’s impartiality and entitle them to a remedy from\nthe court under <a href=\"/doc/363170/\" id=\"a_330\">section 24</a> of the 1996 Act. Those remedies are necessary in the public interest. A legal\nobligation to disclose such matters is encompassed within the statutory obligation of fairness. It is also\nessential corollary of the statutory obligation of impartiality: an arbitrator who knowingly fails to act in a way\nwhich fairness requires to the potential detriment of a party is guilty of partiality. Unless the parties have\nexpressly or implicitly waived their right to disclosure, such disclosure is not just a question of best practice\nbut is a matter of legal obligation.”]\n194\n    UK Law Commission, Review of the Arbitration Act 1996: Final report and Bill, Law Com No. 413 (2023)\n19\n195\n    ibid\n196\n    UK Law Commission (supra) [The Law Commission observed: “3.18 We continue to think that complete\nindependence is not possible. This is so especially where arbitrators are drawn from a small pool with\nspecialist expertise, or where they are expected to have immersive experience in a particular area of activity.\nAny duty of independence might involve defining a required level of independence, which in turn would be\nimpossible, or it might involve defining independence in terms of impartiality after all, which we note is the\napproach of some foreign legislation.”]\n\n                                                                                                Page 69 of 113\n\f                                                                                              PART F\n\n        the European Convention on Human Rights states that “everyone is entitled\n\n        to a fair and public hearing within a reasonable time by an independent and\n\n        impartial tribunal established by law” in the determination of their civil rights\n\n        and obligations. The European Court of Human Rights197 determines the\n\n        existence of impartiality for <a href=\"/doc/19636/\" id=\"a_331\">Article 6</a> by applying (i) a subjective test which\n\n        considers whether the judge holds any personal prejudice or bias in a given\n\n        case; and (ii) an objective test to ascertain whether the tribunal’s\n\n        composition offers significant guarantees to exclude any legitimate doubt in\n\n        respect of its impartiality.198\n\n      102.      In the vast majority of cases, the ECtHR has focused on the objective\n\n        test, which requires the court to determine “whether, quite apart from the\n\n        judge’s conduct, there are ascertainable facts which may raise doubts as to\n\n        his or her impartiality.”199 The objective test takes into consideration\n\n        hierarchical and other links between a judge and the parties to the\n\n        proceedings. The ECtHR’s approach, therefore, emphasizes determining\n\n        “whether the relationship in question is of such a nature and degrees as to\n\n        indicate a lack of impartiality on the part of the tribunal.”200 The real\n\n        possibility of bias test as evolved by the English courts is in alignment with\n\n        the bias test evolved by the ECHR.201 The ECtHR has held that an arbitration\n\n        agreement does not constitute a waiver of the fair procedure guarantees\n\n\n\n\n197\n    “ECtHR”\n198\n    Nicholas v.

Indian approach to the bias test\n\n\n      103.         This Court has consistently adopted the real likelihood test to\n\n            determine bias.203 In Manak Lal v. Dr. Prem Chand Singhvi,204 Justice P B\n\n            Gajendragadkar (as the learned Chief Justice then was) observed that the\n\n            test to determine bias is whether a litigant could reasonably apprehend that\n\n            a bias attributable to a member of the tribunal might have operated against\n\n            him in the final decision. In S Parthasarathi v. State of AP,205 Justice KK\n\n            Mathew observed that the test of likelihood of bias is based on the\n\n            reasonable apprehension of a reasonable man fully cognizant of the facts.\n\n            The learned Judge further observed that the question of whether the real\n\n            likelihood of bias exists is to be determined on the probabilities to be inferred\n\n            from the objective circumstances by a court or based on impressions that\n\n            might reasonably be left on the minds of the aggrieved party or the public at\n\n            large.206 The legal development under English law about the real danger of\n\n            bias test was also accepted by this Court.\n\n\n\n202\n    BEG S.P.A. v.

We think that the reviewing authority must make a determination on\nthe basis of the whole evidence before it, whether a reasonable man would in the circumstances infer that\nthere is real likelihood of bias. The Court must look at the impression which other people have. This follows\nfrom the principle that justice must not only be done but seen to be done. If right minded persons would think\nthat there is real likelihood of bias on the part of an inquiring officer, he must not conduct the enquiry;\nnevertheless, there must be a real likelihood of bias.

In Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd. v. Girja Shankar Pant,207 this\n\n         Court observed that the real danger of bias is essentially based on deciding\n\n         bias based on the facts and circumstances of the individual case.208 In M P\n\n         Special Police Establishment v. State of M P,209 a Constitution Bench\n\n         referred with approval to Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam Ltd. (supra).\n\n    105.          Subsequently, the decision in P D Dinakaran v. Judges Inquiry\n\n         Committee,210 traced the evolution of the bias test under Indian\n\n         jurisprudence to state the following principles:\n\n                         “71. […] To disqualify a person from adjudicating on the\n                         ground of interest in the subject-matter of lis, the test of\n                         real likelihood of the bias is to be applied. In other words,\n                         one has to enquire as to whether there is real danger\n                         of bias on the part of the person against whom such\n                         apprehension is expressed in the sense that he might\n                         favour or disfavour a party. In each case, the court has\n                         to consider whether a fair-minded and informed\n                         person, having considered all the facts would\n                         reasonably apprehend that the Judge would not act\n                         impartially. To put it differently, the test would be whether\n                         a reasonably intelligent man fully apprised of all the facts\n                         would have a serious apprehension of bias.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                                 (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n\nreasonable man would think on the basis of the existing circumstances that he is likely to be prejudiced, that\nis sufficient to quash the decision.”]\n207\n    (2001) 1 SCC 182\n208\n    Kumaon Mandal Vikas Nigam (supra) [35] [“35. The test, therefore, is as to whether a mere apprehension\nof bias or there being a real danger of bias and it is on this score that the surrounding circumstances must\nand ought to be collated and necessary conclusion drawn therefrom — in the event however the conclusion\nis otherwise inescapable that there is existing a real danger of bias, the administrative action cannot be\nsustained: If on the other hand, the allegations pertaining to bias is rather fanciful and otherwise to avoid a\nparticular court, Tribunal or authority, question of declaring them to be unsustainable would not arise.

The principle of real likelihood of bias has now taken a tilt to “real danger\nof bias” and “suspicion of bias”.]\n210\n    (2011) 8 SCC 380\n\n                                                                                                Page 72 of 113\n\f                                                                                             PART F\n\n\n       106.        In Supreme Court Advocates-on-Record Association v. Union of\n\n           India,211 Justice J Chelameswar, writing for himself and Justice A K Goel,\n\n           summarized the following principles of the bias test in India:\n\n                               “25.1. If a Judge has a financial interest in the\n                               outcome of a case, he is automatically disqualified\n                               from hearing the case.\n\n\n\n                               25.2. In cases where the interest of the Judge in the\n                               case is other than financial, then the disqualification\n                               is not automatic but an enquiry is required whether\n                               the existence of such an interest disqualifies the\n                               Judge tested in the light of either on the principle of\n                               “real danger” or “reasonable apprehension” of bias.\n\n\n\n                               25.3. The Pinochet case added a new category i.e.\n                               that the Judge is automatically disqualified from\n                               hearing a case where the Judge is interested in a\n                               cause which is being promoted by one of the parties\n                               to the case.”\n\n\n\n       107.        Although there have been vacillations about the test in England, the\n\n           Indian courts have been largely consistent in their approach by applying the\n\n           test of real likelihood of bias or reasonable apprehension of bias. Recently,\n\n           the court has used the real danger of bias test. However, the above\n\n           discussion shows that there is no significant difference between the real\n\n           danger of bias test and the real possibility of bias test if the question of bias\n\n           is inferred from the perspective of a reasonable or fair-minded person.\n\n       108.        This Court has consistently applied the test of real likelihood of bias\n\n           to determine arbitrator bias. In HRD Corporation v. GAIL (India),212 the\n\n\n211\n      (2016) 5 SCC 808 [25]\n212\n      (2018) 12 SCC 471 [20]\n\n                                                                                         Page 73 of 113\n\f                                                                                                      PART F\n\n         Court explained the application of the real likelihood of bias test to determine\n\n         the issue of arbitrator bias thus:\n\n                            “20. […] As has been pointed out by us hereinabove,\n                            the items contained in the Schedules owe their origin\n                            to the IBA Guidelines, which are to be construed in\n                            the light of the general principles contained therein—\n                            that every arbitrator shall be impartial and\n                            independent of the parties at the time of accepting\n                            his/her appointment. Doubts as to the above are\n                            only justifiable if a reasonable third person\n                            having knowledge of the relevant facts and\n                            circumstances would reach the conclusion that\n                            there is a likelihood that the arbitrator may be\n                            influenced by factors other than the merits of the\n                            case in reaching his or her decision. This test\n                            requires taking a broad commonsensical approach\n                            to the items stated in the Fifth and Seventh\n                            Schedules. This approach would, therefore, require\n                            a fair construction of the words used therein, neither\n                            tending to enlarge or restrict them unduly.”\n\n\n\n                                                             (emphasis supplied)\n\n\n      109.        In Government of Haryana v. GF Toll Road Private Ltd.,213 the\n\n         Court had to decide whether a retired government employee could be\n\n         appointed as an arbitrator by the state government. Justice Indu Malhotra,\n\n         writing for the two-Judge Bench, observed that the test to be applied for bias\n\n         is whether the circumstances are such as would lead a fair-minded and\n\n         informed person to conclude that the arbitrator was in fact biased. It was\n\n         held that the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_333\">Arbitration Act</a> does not disqualify a former employee from\n\n         acting as an arbitrator, provided there are no justifiable doubts as to their\n\n         independence and impartiality.214 Thus, in India, the sanctity and integrity of\n\n\n213\n   (2019) 3 SCC 505\n214\n   GF Tolls Road Private Ltd. (supra) [23] [“23. An arbitrator who has “any other” past or present “business\nrelationship” with the party is also disqualified. The word “other” used in Entry 1, would indicate a relationship\n\n                                                                                                Page 74 of 113\n\f                                                                                             PART F\n\n          the arbitral process are held to the same standard of bias as that applicable\n\n        to judicial authorities.\n\n     v.      Bias and doctrine of necessity in the context of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_334\">Arbitration Act</a>\n\n\n    110.         In comparison to other jurisdictions, the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_335\">Arbitration Act</a> has adopted a\n\n        different approach to deal with the issue of arbitrator bias. Through the 2015\n\n        amendment, the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_336\">Arbitration Act</a> provides an extensive list of circumstances\n\n        which may give rise to justifiable doubts as to an arbitrator’s independence\n\n        or impartiality. The enumeration of categories under the Fifth and Seventh\n\n        Schedules is inspired by the Orange and Red List of the IBA Guidelines on\n\n        Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration.215 In HRD Corporation\n\n          (supra) this Court observed that the categories listed under the Fifth and\n\n          Seventh Schedules must be construed by taking a “broad commonsensical\n\n          approach” without restricting or enlarging the words.\n\n    111.         <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_337\">Section 12</a> of the Arbitration Act places a duty on a person who is\n\n          approached for appointment as an arbitrator to disclose in writing any direct\n\n          or indirect circumstances such as: (i) the existence of any direct or indirect\n\n          past or present relationship with any of the parties; (ii) interest in any of the\n\n          parties; or (iii) interest in relation to the subject-matter in dispute, whether\n\n          financial, business, professional, or other kind. The disclosure of\n\n          circumstances made by an arbitrator is a procedural safeguard which allows\n\n          the parties to assess whether disqualification of the arbitrator is required for\n\n\n\nother than an employee, consultant or an advisor. The word “other” cannot be used to widen the scope of\nthe entry to include past/former employees.”]\n215\n    IBA Guidelines on Conflicts of Interest in International Arbitration (25 May 2024) available at:\nhttps://www.ibanet.org/document?id=Guidelines-on-Conflicts-of-Interest-in-International-Arbitration-2024\n\n                                                                                        Page 75 of 113\n\f                                                                                                 PART F\n\n        a case.216 Disclosure allows an arbitrator to overcome an appearance of\n\n        bias. The parties may challenge the appointment of an arbitrator if the\n\n        circumstances give rise to “justifiable doubts” as to their independence or\n\n        impartiality.\n\n      112.       In Voestalpine (supra), this Court explained the distinction between\n\n        independence and impartiality thus:\n\n                           “22. Independence and impartiality are two different\n                           concepts. An arbitrator may be independent and yet,\n                           lack impartiality, or vice versa. Impartiality, as is well\n                           accepted, is a more subjective concept as compared\n                           to independence. Independence, which is more an\n                           objective     concept, may, thus, be                more\n                           straightforwardly ascertained by the parties at the\n                           outset of the arbitration proceedings in light of the\n                           circumstances disclosed by the arbitrator, while\n                           partiality will more likely surface during the\n                           arbitration proceedings.”\n\n\n\n      113.       The fundamental premise of arbitration is the impartial resolution of\n\n        disputes between parties according to the arbitration agreement.217 Unlike a\n\n        judge, an arbitrator is generally engaged in occupations and professions\n\n        before, during, and after the arbitral proceedings. The arbitrators may also\n\n        have had prior commercial or professional contacts and relationships with\n\n        either of the parties to the dispute. In such circumstances, arbitration law\n\n        has evolved safeguards and mechanisms to ensure the independence and\n\n        impartiality of the arbitral procedure. The independence of an arbitrator is\n\n\n216\n    Koulis v. Cyprus, Application No. 48781/12. [“63. Given the importance of appearances, however, when\nsuch a situation (which can give rise to a suggestion or appearance of bias) arises, that situation should be\ndisclosed at the outset of the proceedings and an assessment should be made, taking into account the\nvarious factors involved in order to determine whether disqualification is actually necessitated in the case.\nThis is an important procedural safeguard which is necessary in order to provide adequate guarantees in\nrespect of both objective and subjective impartiality.”]\n217\n    Jivraj v. Hashwani, [2011] UKSC 40 [45]\n\n                                                                                            Page 76 of 113\n\f                                                                                                      PART F\n\n         generally considered with respect to the relationships or links between the\n\n         arbitrator and one of the parties, whether financial, professional,\n\n         employment or personal.218 The independence of an arbitrator can be\n\n         deduced objectively because the dependence arises from the relationship\n\n         between an arbitrator and one of the parties, or somebody closely\n\n         connected with one of the parties.219 In comparison, the existence of\n\n         impartiality is inferred from facts and circumstances surrounding an\n\n         arbitrator’s exercise of quasi-judicial functions.220\n\n      114.        An arbitrator will not be automatically disqualified in situations where\n\n         the relationship of an arbitrator with parties does not fall under the categories\n\n         mentioned under the Seventh Schedule. Yet, either of the parties may have\n\n         “justifiable doubts” about the independence or impartiality of the arbitrator.\n\n         The party challenging the appointment of an arbitrator does not need to\n\n         demonstrate that the arbitrator lacks independence or impartiality. It only\n\n         needs to show that there are possible “doubts” as to an arbitrator’s\n\n         independence or impartiality.221 The purpose behind incorporating the word\n\n         “justifiable” under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_338\">Section 12</a> was to establish an objective standard for\n\n         impartiality and independence.222 Resultantly, the possibility of “doubts”\n\n\n\n\n218\n    Redfern and Hunter (supra) 226\n219\n    <a href=\"/doc/1659104/\" id=\"a_339\">Article 3</a>, IBA Rules of Ethics for International Arbitrator 1987\n220\n    Peter Binder (supra) 117\n221\n    Gary Born (supra) 1911, 1912. [Gary Born suggests that: “Statutory (and judicial) references to the “risks”\nor “possibility” of partiality are preferable to formulations including “doubt” or “suspicion.” The latter phrases\nconnote a subjective inquiry, as well as a flavor of speculation, which are misleading. The better approach is\ninstead to consider what objective risk (or possibility) of unacceptable partiality exists.”]\n222\n    David Caron and Lee Caplan, The UNCITRAL Arbitration Rules: A Commentary (2nd edn, Oxford\nUniversity Press, 2013) 208\n\n                                                                                                Page 77 of 113\n\f                                                                                     PART F\n\n           must be “real” in the sense that they should be derived from the objective\n\n           circumstances disclosed by an arbitrator.\n\n       115.        The consideration of possible “doubts” must be undertaken from the\n\n           perspective of a “fair-minded and informed person” rather than the\n\n           subjective views of the parties or the arbitrators. According to Gary Born, the\n\n           standard of proof adopted under <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_340\">Article 12</a> of the Model Law is relatively low\n\n           to ensure “the integrity of the arbitral tribunal and arbitral process,\n\n           particularly given the extremely limited review available for substantive or\n\n           procedural errors by the arbitrators.”223 The issue of arbitrator bias is to be\n\n           resolved by applying the test of the real likelihood of bias in the given facts\n\n           and circumstances.\n\n       116.        <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_341\">Section     12(5)</a>   automatically   disqualifies   any   person    whose\n\n           relationship with the parties or counsel or subject matter of the dispute falls\n\n           under any of the categories mentioned under the Seventh Schedule. The\n\n           categories listed in the Seventh Schedule in essence denote situations\n\n           where an arbitrator might have a pecuniary, proprietary, or cause-based\n\n           interest in the arbitration. For instance, employees of either of the parties\n\n           are barred from acting as an arbitrator because they have an immediate\n\n           financial and cause-based interest in the arbitration. If such an employee is\n\n           appointed as an arbitrator, they would be sitting as a judge in their cause\n\n           because they have a pecuniary interest in the outcome of the case.\n\n\n\n\n223\n      Garn Born (supra) 1912\n\n                                                                               Page 78 of 113\n\f                                                                                PART F\n\n117.     In Voestalpine (supra), this Court observed that an individual who\n\n  had previously served the government, a public sector corporation or a\n\n  statutory corporation but had no connection to the party in dispute could not\n\n  be held to be ineligible for appointment as an arbitrator. The Court observed:\n\n                 “25. It cannot be said that simply because the person\n                 is a retired officer who retired from the government\n                 or other statutory corporation or public sector\n                 undertaking and had no connection with DMRC (the\n                 party in dispute), he would be treated as ineligible to\n                 act as an arbitrator. Had this been the intention of the\n                 legislature, the Seventh Schedule would have\n                 covered such persons as well. Bias or even real\n                 likelihood of bias cannot be attributed to such highly\n                 qualified and experienced persons, simply on the\n                 ground that they served the Central Government or\n                 PSUs, even when they had no connection with\n                 DMRC. The very reason for empanelling these\n                 persons is to ensure that technical aspects of the\n                 dispute are suitably resolved by utilising their\n                 expertise when they act as arbitrators. It may also be\n                 mentioned herein that the Law Commission had\n                 proposed the incorporation of the Schedule which\n                 was drawn from the red and orange list of IBA\n                 guidelines on conflict of interest in international\n                 arbitration with the observation that the same would\n                 be treated as the guide “to determine whether\n                 circumstances exist which give rise to such\n                 justifiable doubts”. Such persons do not get covered\n                 by red or orange list of IBA guidelines either.”\n\n\n\n The Court refers to the fact that the individual had no connection with DMRC,\n\n the party in dispute, at two places in the above extract. Hence, the fact that\n\n he had previously been employed with government or a corporation controlled\n\n by government (but not DMRC which was the disputant) was held not to\n\n render the individual ineligible.\n\n118.     In G F Toll Road (supra), the arbitration contract between the State\n\n  government and the contractor allowed for the constitution of a three-\n\n                                                                            Page 79 of 113\n\f                                                                                     PART F\n\n           member arbitral tribunal “of whom each party shall select one and the third\n\n           arbitrator shall be appointed under the Rules of Arbitration of the Indian\n\n           Council of Arbitration.” After disputes arose between the parties, the State\n\n           government appointed a retired Engineer-in-Chief as their arbitrator. The\n\n           contractor and the Indian Council of Arbitration224 challenged the\n\n           appointment of the State’s arbitrator on the ground that he was a former\n\n           employee of the State government. The issue before this Court was whether\n\n           <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_342\">Section 12(5)</a> read with the Seventh Schedule disqualifies a former\n\n           employee from being appointed as an arbitrator.\n\n       119.         Justice Indu Malhotra, writing for the Bench of two judges, held that\n\n           the apprehension of bias against the State’s arbitrator was unjustified\n\n           because: (i) the arbitrator was employed by the State over ten years ago; (ii)\n\n           the use of the expression “is an” under Entry 1 of the Seventh Schedule\n\n           indicates that an arbitrator is disqualified only if they are current employees\n\n           of one of the parties; and (iii) the expression “other” under the said entry\n\n           indicates a relationship other than an employee. It was observed that the\n\n           expression “other” cannot “be used to widen the scope of the entry to include\n\n           past/former employees.”225\n\n       120.         The categories mentioned under the Seventh Schedule are such that\n\n           it is difficult to distinguish the interests of an arbitrator from those of a party\n\n           to which an arbitrator is connected. In such cases, the issue is whether the\n\n           outcome of the arbitration will realistically affect the arbitrator’s interests. The\n\n\n\n224\n      “ICA”\n225\n      G F Toll Road (supra) [23]\n\n                                                                                 Page 80 of 113\n\f                                                                                                        PART F\n\n         law prioritises the objective criterion of independence over the subjective\n\n         criterion of impartiality. Once it is established that an arbitrator falls under\n\n         any of the categories mentioned in the Seventh Schedule, they are\n\n         automatically disqualified without any investigation into whether or not there\n\n         is any real likelihood of bias. Since the ineligibility envisaged under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_343\">Section\n\n         12(5)</a> goes to the root of the appointment, an application may be filed under\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/76709/\" id=\"a_344\">Section 14(2)</a> of the Arbitration Act to the court to decide on the termination\n\n         of the arbitrator’s mandate.226\n\n      121.        An objection to the bias of an adjudicator can be waived.227 A waiver\n\n         is an intentional relinquishment of a right by a party or an agreement not to\n\n         assert a right.228 <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_345\">The Arbitration Act</a> allows parties to waive the application\n\n         of <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_346\">Section 12(5)</a> by an express agreement after the disputes have arisen.\n\n         However, the waiver is subject to two factors. First, the parties can only\n\n         waive the applicability of <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_347\">Section 12(5)</a> after the dispute has arisen. This\n\n         allows parties to determine whether they will be required or necessitated to\n\n         draw upon the services of specific individuals as arbitrators to decide upon\n\n         specific issues. To this effect, Explanation 3 to the Seventh Schedule\n\n         recognizes that certain kinds of arbitration such as maritime or commodities\n\n         arbitration may require the parties to draw upon a small, specialized pool.229\n\n         The second requirement of the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_348\">Section 12(5)</a> is that parties must\n\n\n\n\n226\n    HRD Corporation v.

Davinder Pal Singh Bhullar, (2011) 14 SCC 770 [41]\n229\n    “Explanation 3 – For the removal of doubts, it is clarified that it may be the practice in certain specific kinds\nof arbitration, such as maritime or commodities arbitration, to draw arbitrators from a small, specialized pool.\nIf in such field it is the custom and practice for parties frequently to appoint the same arbitrator in difference\ncases, this is a relevant fact to be taken into account while applying the rules set out above.”]\n\n                                                                                                   Page 81 of 113\n\f                                                                                                 PART F\n\n        consciously abandon their existing legal right through an express\n\n        agreement. Thus, the Arbitration Act reinforces the autonomy of parties by\n\n        allowing them to override the limitations of independence and impartiality by\n\n        an express agreement in that regard.\n\n      122.       The proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_349\">Section 12(5)</a> is a reflection of the common law\n\n        doctrine of necessity. The nemo judex rule is subject to the doctrine of\n\n        necessity and yields to it.230 The doctrine of necessity allows an adjudicator\n\n        who may be disqualified because of their interest in the matter to continue\n\n        to adjudicate because of the necessity of the circumstances.231 The proviso\n\n        to <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_350\">Section 12(5)</a> allows parties to exercise their autonomy to determine if\n\n        there is a necessity to waive the applicability of the ineligibility prescribed\n\n        under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_351\">Section 12(5)</a>. Thus, common law principles and doctrines are\n\n        adjusted to subserve the fundamental principles of arbitration by giving\n\n        priority to the autonomy of parties.\n\n      123.       In Bharat Broadband Network Ltd. (supra), this Court held that the\n\n        proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_352\">Section 12(5)</a> requires an express agreement in writing, that is,\n\n        an agreement made in words as opposed to an agreement that can be\n\n        inferred by conduct.232 It was explained that such an agreement must be\n\n        made by both parties with full knowledge of the fact that although a particular\n\n        person is ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator, the parties still have full\n\n        faith and confidence in them to continue as an arbitrator.233 The principle of\n\n\n\n230\n    Tulsiram Patel (supra) [101]; Swadeshi Cotton Mills v.

After the disputes have\n\n           arisen, the parties can determine whether there is a necessity to waive the\n\n           nemo judex rule. This balances the autonomy of parties and the principles\n\n           of an independent and impartial arbitral tribunal.\n\n     vi.

The doctrine of bias as evolved in English and Indian law emphasizes\n\n           independence and impartiality in the process of adjudication to inspire the\n\n           confidence of the public in the adjudicatory processes. Although <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_355\">Section 12</a>\n\n           deals with the quality of independence and impartiality inherent in the\n\n           arbitrators, the provision’s emphasis is to ensure an independent and\n\n           impartial arbitral process.\n\n    125.         Fali Nariman, distinguished lawyer and erudite jurist, in an article on\n\n           ‘Standards of Behaviour of Arbitrators’,234 opined that the level of probity\n\n           expected of arbitrators is no less, and perhaps more stringent than what is\n\n           expected of judges:\n\n                            “Though litigation is compulsory and arbitration is\n                            consensual, both are judicial processes of an\n                            adversarial character. That is why arbitration has\n                            always been regarded as quasi-judicial. Standards\n                            of behaviour expected of arbitrators – with reference\n                            to their impartiality and their independence – are no\n                            less stringent than that demanded of judges; in fact,\n\n\nknowledge of the fact that Shri Khan is ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator, still go ahead and say that\nthey have full faith and confidence in him to continue as such.”]\n234\n    Fali Nariman, ‘Standards of Behaviour of Arbitrators’ (1988) 4(4) Arbitration International 311, 312.\n\n                                                                                               Page 83 of 113\n\f                                                                                               PART F\n\n                          arbitrators are expected to behave a shade better\n                          since judges are institutionally insulated by the\n                          established court-system, their judgments being also\n                          subjected to the corrective scrutiny of an appeal.”\n\n\n\n      126.       The agreement on the number of arbitrators is a matter of party\n\n        autonomy. However, the choice of arbitrators has a direct effect on the\n\n        conduct of arbitral proceedings. In commercial cases, the choice of the\n\n        number of arbitrators is usually between one and three. The parties select\n\n        the number of arbitrators by considering factors such as the needs of a\n\n        particular dispute, costs, and efficiency.235 In case parties cannot agree upon\n\n        the number of arbitrators, national arbitration legislation specifies the\n\n        number of arbitrators to be appointed. For instance, <a href=\"/doc/202193/\" id=\"a_356\">Article 10(2)</a> of the\n\n        Model Law provides that if the parties fail to determine the number of\n\n        arbitrators, three arbitrators will be appointed.236 Interestingly, the Arbitration\n\n        Act departs from the Model Law by providing that the arbitral tribunal shall\n\n        consist of a sole arbitrator if parties fail to determine the number of\n\n        arbitrators.237\n\n      127.       Reference of disputes to a sole arbitrator has various advantages,\n\n        including easy arrangements of meetings or hearings, reduced expenses\n\n        since the parties will only have to bear the expense of one arbitrator, and\n\n\n\n235\n    Redfern and Hunter (supra) 210\n236\n    <a href=\"/doc/202193/\" id=\"a_357\">Article 10(2)</a>, Model Law. [It reads:\n“Article 10. Number of arbitrators\n(1) The parties are free to determine the number of arbitrators.\n(2) Failing such determination, the number of arbitrators shall be three.”]\n237\n    <a href=\"/doc/499427/\" id=\"a_358\">Section 10</a>, Arbitration Act [It reads:\n“10. Number of arbitrators – (1) The parties are free to determine the number of arbitrators, provided that\nsuch number shall not be an even number.\n(2) Failing the determination referred to in sub-section (1), the arbitral tribunal shall consist of a sole\narbitrator.”]\n\n                                                                                           Page 84 of 113\n\f                                                                                   PART F\n\n           speedy decision-making.238 In the case of the appointment of a sole\n\n           arbitrator, the decision-making vests in the hands of one person. This poses\n\n           a greater risk of bias against the weaker party, especially if the arbitrator is\n\n           unilaterally appointed by the other party.\n\n       128.        If a person having a financial interest in the outcome of the arbitral\n\n           proceedings unilaterally nominates a sole arbitrator, it is bound to give rise\n\n           to justifiable doubts on the independence and impartiality of the arbitrator.\n\n           The possibility of bias by the arbitrator is real because the person who has\n\n           an interest in the subject matter of the dispute can chart out the course of\n\n           the entire arbitration proceeding by unilaterally appointing a sole arbitrator.\n\n           A party may select a particular person to be appointed as a sole arbitrator\n\n           because of a quid pro quo arrangement between them. Moreover, the fact\n\n           that the sole arbitrator owes the appointment to one party may make it\n\n           difficult to decide against that party for fear of displeasure. It is not possible\n\n           to determine whether the sole arbitrator will be prejudiced, but the\n\n           circumstances of the appointment give rise to the real possibility of bias.\n\n       129.        Equal treatment of parties at the stage of appointment of an arbitrator\n\n           ensures impartiality during the arbitral proceedings. A clause that allows\n\n           one party to unilaterally appoint a sole arbitrator is exclusive and hinders\n\n           equal participation of the other party in the appointment process of\n\n           arbitrators. Further, arbitration is a quasi-judicial and adjudicative process\n\n           where both parties ought to be treated equally and given an equal\n\n\n\n\n238\n      Redfern and Hunter (supra) 211\n\n                                                                               Page 85 of 113\n\f                                                                               PART F\n\n        opportunity to persuade the decision-maker of the merits of the case. An\n\n        arbitral process where one party or its proxy has the power to unilaterally\n\n        decide who will adjudicate on a dispute is fundamentally contrary to the\n\n        adjudicatory function of arbitral tribunals.239\n\n      130.      In comparison, a three-member arbitral tribunal usually allows each\n\n        party to nominate one arbitrator of their choice, with the third arbitrator being\n\n        appointed either by the two party-appointed arbitrators or by agreement of\n\n        parties.240 The fact that both parties nominate their respective arbitrators\n\n        gives them “a sense of investment in the arbitral tribunal.”241 A three-member\n\n        arbitral tribunal also enhances the quality of the adjudicative deliberations\n\n        and ensures compliance with due process.242 According to Gary Born, the\n\n        major advantage of a three-member tribunal is that the parties can\n\n        participate in the selection of the tribunal to the maximum extent possible.243\n\n      131.      In a three-member tribunal, each of the parties seeks to appoint a co-\n\n        arbitrator. However, the third arbitrator is usually appointed by a process\n\n        which allows equal participation of both parties in the appointment process.\n\n        The equal participation of parties enables the appointment of an\n\n        independent and impartial third arbitrator. Hence, any perceived tilt of an\n\n        arbitrator in favour of the party which nominated that arbitrator is offset by\n\n        the appointment of the third arbitrator in the course of a deliberative process\n\n        involving both the arbitrators or as envisaged in the agreement between\n\n\n\n239\n    Gary Born (supra) 1952\n240\n    Ibid, 211\n241\n    Ibid.\n242\n    Gary Born (supra) 1794\n243\n    Ibid, at 1796.\n\n                                                                           Page 86 of 113\n\f                                                                              PART F\n\n        parties. Perkins (supra) rightly observed that whatever advantage a party\n\n        may derive by nominating an arbitrator of its choice would get counter-\n\n        balanced by equal power with the other party.244 This counter-balancing will\n\n        ideally apply only in situations where the arbitrators are appointed by the\n\n        parties in the exercise of their genuine party autonomy. TRF (supra) and\n\n        Perkins (supra) have been relied upon by this Court on numerous\n\n        occasions, including in Glock Asia-Pacific Limited v. Union of India245 and\n\n        Lombardi Engg Ltd. v. Uttarakhand Jal Vidyut Nigam Ltd.246\n\n      132.      In Voestalpine (supra) and CORE (supra), one of the parties curated\n\n        a panel of arbitrators and mandated the other party to select their arbitrator\n\n        from the panel. Since the curation of the list is exclusively undertaken by\n\n        one party, the other party is effectively excluded from the process of curating\n\n        the panel from which exclusively, the appointment of an arbitrator is to be\n\n        made. The other party has to mandatorily select its arbitrator from a curated\n\n        panel, restricting their freedom to appoint an arbitrator of their choice. This\n\n        is against the principle of equal treatment contained under <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_359\">Section 18</a>. In\n\n        this situation, there is no effective counter-balance because both parties do\n\n        not participate equally in the process of appointing arbitrators. The party\n\n        curating the panel can restrict the choice of the party only to a person who\n\n        is on the panel selected by the other party and to no other person.\n\n      133.      Many PSUs are regularly involved in arbitration disputes and\n\n        constantly need the services of arbitrators. Such institutions often maintain\n\n\n244\n    Perkins (supra) [16]\n245\n    (2023) 8 SCC 226 [20]\n246\n    (2024) 4 SCC 341 [85]\n\n                                                                          Page 87 of 113\n\f                                                                        PART F\n\n  a pool of potential arbitrators with the sole object of having a ready pool of\n\n  qualified professionals who have committed their time and consented to act\n\n  as arbitrators for fixed fees. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_360\">The Arbitration Act</a> does not prohibit parties to\n\n  an arbitration agreement from maintaining a curated panel of potential\n\n  arbitrators. However, the problem arises when the PSUs make it mandatory\n\n  for other parties to select their nominees from the curated panel of\n\n  arbitrators. When a PSU exercises its discretion to curate a panel, the very\n\n  factor that the PSU is choosing only a certain number of persons as potential\n\n  arbitrators and not others will raise a reasonable doubt in the mind of a fair-\n\n  minded person. The PSUs may conceivably have nominated a person on\n\n  the panel of potential arbitrators because they have a certain predisposition\n\n  in favour of the former. This doubt is reinforced when the other party is given\n\n  no choice but to select its arbitrator from the curated panel.\n\n134.    In CORE (supra), the three-member tribunal was sought to be\n\n  constituted in the following manner: (i) the Railways would suggest at least\n\n  four names of retired railway officers; (ii) the contractor would select two\n\n  names out of the panel for appointment as their arbitrator; (iii) The General\n\n  Manager (of the Railways) would thereafter choose at least one person out\n\n  of the two to be appointed as the contractor’s arbitrator; and (iv) The General\n\n  Manager would proceed to appoint the balance arbitrators from the panel or\n\n  outside the panel and also indicate the presiding arbitrator.\n\n135.    Such an arbitrator-appointment clause is likely to give rise to\n\n  justifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality of arbitrators for\n\n  two reasons: (i) the contractor is restricted to choosing its arbitrator from\n\n                                                                    Page 88 of 113\n\f                                                                        PART F\n\n  the panel of four arbitrators nominated by the party who is a disputant; and\n\n  (ii) the contractor’s choice is further constrained because it is made subject\n\n  to the decision of the General Manager who will choose one among the two\n\n  persons suggested by the party. Since the contractor has to select its\n\n  arbitrator from a curated panel, the arbitration clause does not allow the\n\n  contractor equal participation in the appointment of their arbitrator.\n\n  Moreover, the clause allows the General Manager to appoint the balance\n\n  arbitrators from either the panel or outside the panel. Thus, the process of\n\n  appointing the arbitrators is unequal because the General Manager can go\n\n  beyond the panel of four potential arbitrators, while the contractor is bound\n\n  by the names enlisted in the panel.\n\n136.    In a three-member tribunal, the independence and impartiality of a\n\n  third or presiding arbitrator are prerequisites to the integrity of the arbitral\n\n  proceedings. In CORE (supra), the arbitration clause allowed the General\n\n  Manager to unilaterally nominate the presiding officer out of the panel of\n\n  three arbitrators. The clause does not countenance any participation from\n\n  the contractor in the process of appointing or nominating the presiding\n\n  officer. Thus, the process of appointing and nominating the presiding officer\n\n  is unequal and prejudiced in favour of the Railways. The fact that the\n\n  General Manager is nominating the presiding officer gives rise to a\n\n  reasonable doubt about the independence and impartiality of the entire\n\n  arbitration proceedings.\n\n137.    Given the above discussion, it needs reiteration that the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_361\">Arbitration\n\n  Act</a> does not prohibit PSUs from empanelling potential arbitrators. However,\n\n                                                                    Page 89 of 113\n\f                                                                                                 PART G\n\n            an arbitration clause cannot mandate the other party to select its arbitrator\n\n            from the panel curated by PSUs.

The proposal is said to be accepted\n\n            when the promisee signifies their assent. A proposal becomes a promise\n\n            upon acceptance. Every promise and every set of promises, forming the\n\n            consideration248 for each other, is an agreement. An agreement enforceable\n\n            by law is a contract.\n\n       i.

Although the Contract Act does not define the expression “public\n\n        policy”, it has generally been defined as a principle of judicial legislation or\n\n        interpretation founded on the current needs of the community.251 <a href=\"/doc/238279/\" id=\"a_373\">Section 23</a>\n\n        codified the common law position that “all contracts and agreements which\n\n        have as their object anything contrary to principles of sound policy are\n\n        void.”252 The prevalent view in the nineteenth century was that the doctrine\n\n        of public policy should be governed by precedent and courts should refrain\n\n        from inventing new heads of public policy. The purpose behind limiting the\n\n        grounds of public policy was to respect the freedom of contract of parties,\n\n        which was also considered as a paramount policy in common law.253 Under\n\n        the common law, a contract for marriage brokerage, creation of a perpetuity,\n\n        in restraint of trade, gaming or wagering, or assisting the King’s enemies\n\n        were unlawful and opposed to public policy.254\n\n      142.      This Court has adopted a flexible approach to the application of the\n\n        doctrine of public policy to contracts. In Gherulal Parakh v.

The three-Judge Bench observed that\n\n           public policy is a branch of common law and can be applied in clear and\n\n           incontestable cases of harm to the public. It was further observed that the\n\n           doctrine could be invoked by evolving “a new head under exceptional\n\n           circumstances of a changing world.” The court must determine public policy\n\n           by considering the welfare of society and the social consequences of the\n\n           rule propounded, especially in light of the factual evidence available to its\n\n           probable result.256 In Delhi Transport Corporation v. DTC Mazdoor\n\n           Congress,257 this Court held that courts can rely upon the Constitution as a\n\n           source of public policy. In his concurring opinion, Justice Ramaswamy\n\n           observed:\n\n                             “292. From this perspective, it must be held that in\n                             the absence of specific head of public policy which\n                             covers a case, then the court must in consonance\n                             with public conscience and in keeping with public\n                             good and public interest invent new public policy and\n                             declare such practice or rules that are derogatory to\n                             the Constitution to be opposed to public policy.

In Central Inland Water Transport Corporation v. Brojo Nath\n\n          Ganguly,258 this Court had to decide on the validity of Rule 9 of Central\n\n          Inland Water Transport Corporation Ltd Service Discipline and Appeal Rules\n\n          1979 which empowered the corporation to terminate the employment of its\n\n          permanent employees with three months’ notice. These rules constituted\n\n          part of the contract of employment between the Corporation and its\n\n          employees. The issue before this Court was whether Rule 9 was void under\n\n          <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_375\">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act for being opposed to public policy. It was held\n\n          that the court could refuse to enforce an unfair and unreasonable clause in\n\n          a contract entered into between parties who are not equal in bargaining\n\n          power:\n\n                         “89. […] The Constitution was enacted to secure to\n                         all the citizens of this country social and economic\n                         justice. <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_376\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution guarantees to\n                         all persons equality before the law and the equal\n                         protection of the laws. The principle deducible from\n                         the above discussions on this part of the case is in\n                         consonance with right and reason, intended to\n                         secure social and economic justice and conforms to\n                         the mandate of the great equality clause in <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_377\">Article 14.</a>\n                         This principle is that the courts will not enforce and\n                         will, when called upon to do so, strike down an unfair\n                         and unreasonable contract, or an unfair and\n                         unreasonable clause in a contract, entered into\n                         between parties who are not equal in bargaining\n                         power. It is difficult to give an exhaustive list of all\n                         bargains of this type.

One can only attempt to give some\n                         illustrations. For instance, the above principle will\n                         apply where the inequality of bargaining power is the\n                         result of the great disparity in the economic strength\n                         of the contracting parties. It will apply where the\n                         inequality is the result of circumstances, whether of\n                         the creation of the parties or not.

It will also apply\n                           where a man has no choice, or rather no meaningful\n                           choice, but to give his assent to a contract or to sign\n                           on the dotted line in a prescribed or standard form or\n                           to accept a set of rules as part of the contract,\n                           however unfair, unreasonable and unconscionable a\n                           clause in that contract or form or rules may be. This\n                           principle, however, will not apply where the\n                           bargaining power of the contracting parties is\n                           equal or almost equal.

Importantly, the Court\n\n         held that the pre-deposit requirement was contrary to the object of arbitration\n\n         because it served as a deterrent for a party to invoke arbitration.270 The pre-\n\n         deposit clause was termed arbitrary for defeating the purpose of arbitration.\n\n      148.

The     doctrine of        unconscionability has roots in                   equity. An\n\n        unconscionable contract “is a contract which no man in his senses, not\n\n        under delusion, would make, on the one hand, and which no fair and honest\n\n        man would accept on the other.”276 Unconscionability has also been defined\n\n        to include: (i) an absence of meaningful choice on the part of one of the\n\n        parties; and (ii) unreasonable contractual terms favourable to one party.277\n\n        The unconscionability doctrine seeks to balance the freedom of contract with\n\n        the values of protecting the weaker parties from imposition and\n\n        oppression.278\n\n      151.       Unconscionability focuses on abuses relating to the contract\n\n        formation process (procedural unconscionability) and the substantive terms\n\n        of the contract (substantive unconscionability).279 In determining procedural\n\n\n274\n    Perry v.

US courts have consistently held that an arbitration agreement which\n\n        provides for the unilateral formation of a panel of arbitrators by one of the\n\n        parties is inherently inequitable and unconscionable.281 The reason is that\n\n        a unilateral arbitrator selection clause is inimical to the principle of\n\n        arbitration, that is, the resolution of disputes through a fair and impartial\n\n        tribunal. It has been held that an arbitration agreement that allows one of\n\n        the parties to unilaterally control the arbitral tribunal conflicts with the\n\n        “fundamental notions of fairness”282 and does not meet the “minimum levels\n\n        of integrity which we must demand of a contractually structured substitute\n\n        for judicial proceedings.”283 The US courts have emphasised the importance\n\n        of equality in the appointment process as a means to secure fairness in the\n\n        arbitration proceedings.284\n\n      153.

However, the\n\n           employee’s arbitrator and the third arbitrator were selected from a list of\n\n           arbitrators created exclusively by the employer. The Court observed that the\n\n           arbitration agreement gave Hooters “control over the entire panel and places\n\n           no limits whatsoever on whom Hooters can put on the list.” It was further\n\n           observed:\n\n                             “Under the rules, Hooters is free to devise lists of\n                             partial arbitrators who have existing relationships,\n                             financial or familial, with Hooters and its\n                             management.

The Court held that the process of selection of the\n\n         arbitrator prevented the arbitration from being an effective substitute for a\n\n         judicial forum because: (i) the employer exercised unilateral control over the\n\n         entire panel; (ii) the arbitrator selection procedure allowed the employer to\n\n         create a symbiotic relationship with its arbitrators, which promulgated bias;\n\n         and (iii) the arbitrator selection procedure inherently lacked fairness and\n\n         neutrality.\n\n      iii.

Although arbitration law is an autonomous legal field,288 it functions\n\n         within the boundaries prescribed by the state.

The provisions of the statute, including <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_394\">Section 34</a>, highlight the\n\n        important role played by the Indian legal system in recognising and\n\n        enforcing arbitral awards. It is one such instance where the Indian courts\n\n        exercise a measure of control over the private arbitral process.297 This\n\n        control over the arbitral process ensures that the arbitral awards are made\n\n        by following certain minimum standards of due process and justice.298 Thus,\n\n        the courts must ensure that the arbitral awards are consistent with the\n\n        fundamental policy of Indian law such as compliance with the principles of\n\n\n\n296\n    (2024) 7 SCC 197 [34]\n297\n    Redfern and Hunter (supra) 58\n298\n    Ibid.\n\n                                                                                     Page 104 of 113\n\f                                                                                                        PART G\n\n         natural justice.

By agreeing to arbitrate in a public-private contract, the government\n\n         or its companies agree to settle their disputes with private contractors\n\n         through arbitration. Since the activities of the government have a public\n\n         element, it is incumbent upon the government to ensure that it enters into a\n\n         contract with the public without adopting any unfair or unreasonable\n\n         procedure.300 Every action of a public authority or a person acting in the\n\n         public interest or any act that gives rise to a public element must be based\n\n         on principles of fairness and non-arbitrariness.301 Therefore, government\n\n         agencies have to consider the principles of equality and non-arbitrariness\n\n         when crafting arbitration procedures, including the procedure for the\n\n         appointment of arbitrators.

In a public-private\n\n  contract, the government and its instrumentalities must ensure that the\n\n  arbitral process contemplated by the contract is also fair to the other party\n\n  to avoid arbitrariness.\n\n162.     The possibility of bias is real in situations where an arbitration clause\n\n  allows a government company to unilaterally appoint a sole arbitrator or\n\n  control the majority of the arbitrators. Since the government has control over\n\n  the arbitral tribunal, it can chart the course of the arbitration proceedings to\n\n  the prejudice of the other party. Resultantly, unilateral appointment clauses\n\n  fail to provide an effective substitute for judicial proceedings in India. Further,\n\n  a unilateral appointment clause is inherently exclusionary and violates the\n\n  principle of equal treatment of parties and procedural equality.\n\n163.     Unilateral appointment clauses in a public-private contract fail to\n\n  provide the minimum level of integrity required in authorities performing\n\n  quasi-judicial functions such as arbitral tribunals. Therefore, a unilateral\n\n  appointment clause is against the principle of arbitration, that is, impartial\n\n  resolution of disputes between parties. It also violates the nemo judex rule\n\n  which constitutes the public policy of India in the context of arbitration.\n\n  Therefore, unilateral appointment clauses in public-private contracts are\n\n  violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_397\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution for being arbitrary in addition to\n\n  being violative of the equality principle under the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_398\">Arbitration Act</a>.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      Page 106 of 113\n\f                                                                                     PART H\n\nH.

This Court held that the\n\n          scope of the proeceeding under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_402\">Section 11</a> must be confined to the\n\n          existence of an arbitration agreement. The Court further observed:\n\n                        “165. The legislature confined the scope of\n                        reference under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_403\">Section 11</a>(6-A) to the examination\n                        of the existence of an arbitration agreement. The use\n                        of the term “examination” in itself connotes that the\n                        scope of the power is limited to a prima facie\n                        determination. Since the Arbitration Act is a self-\n                        contained code, the requirement of “existence” of an\n                        arbitration agreement draws effect from <a href=\"/doc/1737370/\" id=\"a_404\">Section 7</a> of\n                        the Arbitration Act.

The burden of proving the existence of\n                arbitration agreement generally lies on the party\n                seeking to rely on such agreement. In jurisdictions\n                such as India, which accept the doctrine of\n                competence-competence, only prima facie proof of\n                the existence of an arbitration agreement must be\n                adduced before the Referral Court. The Referral\n                Court is not the appropriate forum to conduct a mini-\n                trial by allowing the parties to adduce the evidence\n                in regard to the existence or validity of an arbitration\n                agreement. The determination of the existence and\n                validity of an arbitration agreement on the basis of\n                evidence ought to be left to the Arbitral Tribunal. This\n                position of law can also be gauged from the plain\n                language of the statute.\n\n\n\n                167. <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_409\">Section 11</a>(6-A) uses the expression\n                “examination of the existence of an arbitration\n                agreement”. The purport of using the word\n                “examination” connotes that the legislature intends\n                that the Referral Court has to inspect or scrutinise\n                the dealings between the parties for the existence of\n                an     arbitration agreement.      Moreover,     the\n                expression “examination” does not connote or\n                imply a laborious or contested inquiry. On the\n                other hand, <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_410\">Section 16</a> provides that the Arbitral\n                Tribunal can “rule” on its jurisdiction, including\n                the existence and validity of an arbitration\n                agreement. A “ruling” connotes adjudication of\n                disputes after admitting evidence from the\n                parties. Therefore, it is evident that the Referral\n                Court is only required to examine the existence\n                of arbitration agreements, whereas the Arbitral\n                Tribunal ought to rule on its jurisdiction,\n                including the issues pertaining to the existence\n                and validity of an arbitration agreement.”\n\n\n\n\n                                                (emphasis supplied)\n\nThe Constitution Bench held that the nature of objections to the jurisdiction of\n\nan arbitral tribunal on the basis that stamp duty has not been paid or is\n\n\n\n\n                                                                           Page 108 of 113\n\f                                                                                                 PART I\n\n       inadequate cannot be decided on a prima facie basis.303 Hence, it was\n\n       observed that objections of such a kind will require a detailed consideration\n\n       of evidence and submissions and a finding as to the law as well as the facts.\n\n      165.       At the <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_411\">Section 11</a> stage, a referral court only has to determine the\n\n        existence of arbitration agreement. The validity of the arbitration clause\n\n        providing for the procedure for appointment of arbitrators will require the\n\n        referral court to enter into a detailed consideration of evidence and render a\n\n        finding as to law and facts. This issue should be left to be decided by the\n\n        arbitral tribunal in view of the doctrine of competence-competence. The\n\n        arbitral tribunal is competent to rule on its jurisdiction, including the issue of\n\n        validity of the arbitration clause for violating the equality principle under the\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_412\">Arbitration Act</a>.\n\nI.     Prospective Overruling\n\n\n      166.       A decision of this Court has retrospective effect unless expressly\n\n        given a prospective effect. Commercial relations are structured on the basis\n\n        of law.

The judgment in Bhatia International [(2002) 4\n                       SCC 105] was rendered by this Court on 13-3-2002.\n                       Since then, the aforesaid judgment has been\n                       followed by all the High Courts as well as by this\n                       Court on numerous occasions. In fact, the judgment\n                       in Venture Global Engg. [(2008) 4 SCC 190] has\n                       been rendered on 10-1-2008 in terms of the ratio of\n                       the decision in Bhatia International [(2002) 4 SCC\n                       105]. Thus, in order to do complete justice, we\n                       hereby order, that the law now declared by this Court\n                       shall apply prospectively, to all the arbitration\n                       agreements executed hereafter.”\n\n\n\n\n      168.     In the present reference, we have upheld the decisions of this Court\n\n        in TRF (supra) and Perkins (supra) which dealt with situations dealing with\n\n        sole arbitrators. Thus, TRF (supra) and Perkins (supra) have held the field\n\n        for years now. However, we have disagreed with Voestalpine (supra) and\n\n        CORE (supra) which dealt with the appointment of a three-member arbitral\n\n        tribunal. We are aware of the fact that giving retrospective effect to the law\n\n\n307\n    2024 SCC OnLine SC 1974\n308\n    (2012) 9 SCC 552\n309\n    (2002) 4 SCC 105\n\n                                                                               Page 110 of 113\n\f                                                                               PART J\n\n        laid down in the present case may possibly lead to the nullification of\n\n        innumerable completed and ongoing arbitration proceedings involving\n\n        three-member tribunals. This will disturb the commercial bargains entered\n\n        into by both the government and private entities. Therefore, we hold that the\n\n        law laid down in the present reference will apply prospectively to arbitrator\n\n        appointments to be made after the date of this judgment. This direction only\n\n        applies to three-member tribunals.\n\n\n\n\nJ.    Conclusion\n\n\n\n     169.      In view of the above discussion, we conclude that:\n\n\n     a. The principle of equal treatment of parties applies at all stages of arbitration\n\n        proceedings, including the stage of appointment of arbitrators;\n\n\n     b. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_416\">The Arbitration Act</a> does not prohibit PSUs from empanelling potential\n\n        arbitrators. However, an arbitration clause cannot mandate the other party\n\n        to select its arbitrator from the panel curated by PSUs;\n\n\n     c. A clause that allows one party to unilaterally appoint a sole arbitrator gives\n\n        rise to justifiable doubts as to the independence and impartiality of the\n\n        arbitrator. Further, such a unilateral clause is exclusive and hinders equal\n\n        participation of the other party in the appointment process of arbitrators;\n\n\n\n\n                                                                          Page 111 of 113\n\f                                                                           PART J\n\nd. In the appointment of a three-member panel, mandating the other party to\n\n   select its arbitrator from a curated panel of potential arbitrators is against the\n\n   principle of equal treatment of parties. In this situation, there is no effective\n\n   counterbalance because parties do not participate equally in the process of\n\n   appointing arbitrators. The process of appointing arbitrators in CORE\n\n   (supra) is unequal and prejudiced in favour of the Railways;\n\n\ne. Unilateral appointment clauses in public-private contracts are violative of\n\n   <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_417\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution;\n\n\nf. The principle of express waiver contained under the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_418\">Section 12(5)</a>\n\n   also applies to situations where the parties seek to waive the allegation of\n\n   bias against an arbitrator appointed unilaterally by one of the parties. After\n\n   the disputes have arisen, the parties can determine whether there is a\n\n   necessity to waive the nemo judex rule; and\n\n\ng. The law laid down in the present reference will apply prospectively to\n\n   arbitrator appointments to be made after the date of this judgment. This\n\n   direction applies to three-member tribunals.\n\n\n\n\n                                                                      Page 112 of 113\n\f                                                                          PART J\n\n  170.

I am in agreement with the view of the learned Chief Justice\n\nthat the principle of equality under <a href=\"/doc/1347069/\" id=\"a_419\">Section 18</a> of the Arbitration\n\nand Conciliation Act,1996(for short ‘<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_420\">Arbitration Act</a>’) applies at all\n\nstages of the proceedings including the stage of appointment of\n\narbitrators. His judgment offers a thorough examination (in Part\n\nD) of the mandatory provisions within the Model Law and the\n\nArbitration Act, which underscores the applicability of the\n\nequality principle and the same is not reiterated here for the sake\n\nof brevity. It is also correct to say that the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_421\">Arbitration Act</a> does\n\nnot provide special or different treatment to government or\n\ngovernment undertakings involved in arbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_5\">3.   Nonetheless, it is not possible for me to agree with the view\n\ncanvassed that the principles of constitutional law can be\n\ninvoked to reinforce the equality doctrine in the realm of\n\narbitration. On this aspect, Justice Narasimha has rightly opined\n\nthat public law principles evolved in Constitutional and\n\nAdministrative law, should not generally be imported to\n\narbitration law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">4.   Anchoring the principle of equality amongst the arbitrating\n\nparties from the framework of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_422\">Arbitration Act</a>, rather than\n\ninvoking constitutional and administrative law principles, in my\n\nopinion, will not only preserve impartiality in the appointment of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                            Page 2 of 24</span>\n\f      arbitrator but will also ensure party autonomy. It is also\n\n      imperative to observe that Courts should exercise judicial\n\n      restraint at the threshold stage of appointing an arbitrator. This\n\n      will then safeguard the core principles of equality, party\n\n      autonomy, and minimal judicial intervention in the arbitration\n\n      domain.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">      5.   The notion that Alternative Dispute Resolution offers ‘rough\n\n      justice’ rather than true justice, is no more in vogue although\n\n      some scepticism towards arbitration was earlier noticed, across\n\n      various jurisdictions1. Trusting the arbitral process is essential\n\n      and we must dispel the notion that arbitration provides ‘second-\n\n      hand justice’. To lend credibility to the arbitral process, statutory\n\n      procedural safeguards promoting basic fairness must be given\n\n      full play. A key factor in establishing arbitration’s legitimacy lies\n\n      in ensuring independence and impartiality at all stages of the\n\n      arbitral process. At the same time, excessive judicial intervention\n\n      must be avoided. By striking this balance between procedural\n\n      protections and judicial restraint, we can reinforce arbitration’s\n\n      role as an autonomous system capable of delivering justice on\n\n      par with traditional courts.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_8\">\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">1</span>\n    Gary Born, International Commercial Arbitration (2nd edn, Kluwer 2014)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                    Page 3 of 24</span>\n\f                     Scope of Judicial Interference\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">6.

Thus, for example, if the\n      procedure agreed on results in an arbitral tribunal that fails\n      to meet the standard of impartiality and independence\n      established by <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_447\">Article 12</a> the arbitrator would be subjected\n      to challenge. ….The working group considered at some\n      length adding to <a href=\"/doc/1678224/\" id=\"a_448\">Article 11</a> an explicit on the parties’ freedom\n      to determine the procedures for selection of arbitrators.

This provision was later\n      deleted because (1)the problem did not arise frequently;\n      (2)other provisions of the law such as <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_449\">Article 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/846153/\" id=\"a_450\">34</a>,\n      could be used to address the problem and (3) the wording\n      was regarded as too vague and thus could lead to dilatory\n      tactics and potentially invalidation of ‘well-established and\n      recognized appointment practices’’\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_20\">14.       The court’s role in ensuring an arbitrator’s impartiality\n\nand independence is indeed essential. However, this duty, as is\n\nclear from above, must be grounded in <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_451\">Section 12</a> of the\n\nArbitration Act which provides adequate standards for dealing\n\nwith potential conflicts or biases. By setting specific parameters\n\nfor impartiality, <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_452\">Section 12</a> effectively limits arbitrary or\n\nunjustified challenges while still safeguarding the fairness of\n\narbitration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">15.

One of the main objectives behind the enactment\n              of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_465\">Arbitration Act</a> was to minimize the supervisory\n              role of courts in the arbitral process by confining it only\n              to the circumstances stipulated by the legislature. For\n              instance, <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_466\">Section 16</a> of the Arbitration Act provides that\n              the arbitral tribunal may rule on its own jurisdiction\n              “including ruling on any objection with respect to the\n              existence or validity of the arbitration agreement.” The\n              effect of <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_467\">Section 16</a>, bearing in view the principle of\n              minimum judicial interference, is that judicial\n              authorities cannot intervene in matters dealing with the\n              jurisdiction of the arbitral tribunal. Although <a href=\"/doc/1232861/\" id=\"a_468\">Sections 8</a>\n              and <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_469\">11</a> allow courts to refer parties to arbitration or\n              appoint arbitrators, <a href=\"/doc/1091250/\" id=\"a_470\">Section 5</a> limits the courts from\n              dealing with substantive objections pertaining to the\n              existence and validity of arbitration agreements at the\n              referral or appointment stage.

The legislative mandate of 1prima facie\n              determination ensures that the referral courts do not\n              trammel the arbitral tribunal’s authority to rule on its\n              own jurisdiction.”\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_27\">      21.     While reiterating on the limited scrutiny of courts at the\n\n      stage of initiating the arbitral process, the 7-judge bench also\n\n      emphasized that while <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_473\">Section 16</a> deals with both ‘existence’ and\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_23\">9</span>\n    (2024) 6 SCC 1\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                   Page 11 of 24</span>\n\f     ‘validity’, <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_474\">Section 11</a> deals only with ‘existence’ of the arbitration\n\n     agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_28\">     22.    In view of the above authoritative pronouncement by the\n\n     7-Judge bench, critical scrutiny at the <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_475\">Section 11</a> stage would\n\n     be antithetical to the objective of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_476\">Arbitration Act</a> and this will\n\n     also impinge on the principle of party autonomy. As we have\n\n     noted earlier, <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_477\">Section 11(8)</a> itself provides for the requirement of\n\n     disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_478\">Section 12</a> and therefore importing principles\n\n     of constitutional law to justify intervention at the <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_479\">Section 11</a>\n\n     stage, would surely defeat the very objective of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_480\">Arbitration\n\n     Act</a>.

The Law Commission report also made the following\n\ncritical observation:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_34\">\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">      “60. The Commission, however, feels that real and\n      genuine party autonomy must be respected, and, in\n      certain situations, parties should be allowed to waive\n      even the categories of ineligibility as set in the\n      proposed Fifth Schedule. This could be in situations of\n      family arbitrations or other arbitrations where a person\n      commands the blind faith and trust of the parties to the\n      dispute, despite the existence of objective “justifiable\n      doubts” regarding his independence and impartiality. To\n      deal with such situations, the Commission has\n      proposed the proviso to <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_484\">section 12 (5)</a>, where parties\n      may, subsequent to disputes having arisen between\n      them, waive the applicability of the proposed <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_485\">section 12\n      (5)</a> by an express agreement in writing. In all other\n      cases, the general rule in the proposed <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_486\">section 12 (5)</a>\n      must be followed. In the event the High Court is\n      approached in connection with appointment of an\n      arbitrator, the Commission has proposed seeking the\n      disclosure in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_487\">section 12 (1)</a>. and in which\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                             Page 13 of 24</span>\n\f           context the High Court or the designate is to have “due\n           regard” to the contents of such disclosure in appointing\n           the arbitrator.”\n                                                [emphasis supplied]\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">     26.

The Sixth Schedule specifies the\n\nrequirement of disclosure to be made by an arbitrator. The\n\nSeventh Schedule incorporates the ‘Red List’ of the IBA\n\nGuidelines, outlining scenarios of relationship conflict that\n\nwould result in de jure ineligibility of the arbitrator.

It\n\nprovides for the termination of an arbitrator’s mandate if he, de\n\nfacto or de jure, becomes unable to perform his functions or for\n\nother reasons, fails to act without undue delay. Unless agreed\n\notherwise, one can apply to ‘Court’ to decide on the termination\n\nof a mandate. It is crucial to note that the term ‘Court’ herein is\n\nnot the <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_503\">Section 11</a> Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">31.     <a href=\"/doc/1294263/\" id=\"a_504\">Section 15</a> is titled ‘Termination of mandate and\n\nSubstitution of Arbitrator’. <a href=\"/doc/1294263/\" id=\"a_505\">Section 15(1)</a> states that in addition\n\nto the circumstances mentioned in <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_506\">Section 13</a> and <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_507\">14</a>, the\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                             Page 16 of 24</span>\n\fmandate of an arbitrator shall terminate when he withdraws from\n\noffice for any reason, or by (or pursuant to) an agreement of the\n\nparties. <a href=\"/doc/1882318/\" id=\"a_508\">Section 31</a> provides for the form and contents of the\n\narbitral award. <a href=\"/doc/874260/\" id=\"a_509\">Section 32</a> provides for the termination of the\n\narbitrator’s mandate, either by delivery of a final award or any of\n\nthe   circumstances    mentioned       in   <a href=\"/doc/874260/\" id=\"a_510\">Section   32(2)</a>   such   as\n\nwithdrawal of the claim by the claimant, agreement between\n\nparties to terminate proceedings, or continuation of proceedings\n\nhaving become unnecessary or impossible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">32.     What follows from the above is that if the Arbitrator has\n\nany relationship with any of the parties that raises a reasonable\n\napprehension of bias, such an arbitrator can anyway be de jure\n\nbarred under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_511\">Sections 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_512\">14</a>, read with the Fifth and the\n\nSeventh Schedules of the Arbitration Act. Post-appointment also,\n\na challenge can be made under <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_513\">Section 13(2)</a> of the Arbitration\n\nAct against appointment. It is also possible to finally set aside\n\nan award for procedural violations, under <a href=\"/doc/1722761/\" id=\"a_514\">Section 34(2)(iii)</a> or\n\n34(2)(v) of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_515\">Arbitration Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">33.     Importantly, the Arbitration Act does not per se prohibit\n\nunilateral appointment of arbitrators.

The 2015 Amendment, addressed specific\n\n     concerns regarding fairness, potential advantage to one party as\n\n     well as independence and impartiality of an unilaterally\n\n     appointed arbitrator under the IBA Guidelines. An eligible\n\n     arbitrator, not otherwise disqualified under <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_518\">Schedule VII of the\n\n     Act</a>, can be appointed unilaterally, and courts should refrain\n\n     from imposing their own opinion countermanding the clear\n\n     intent of the parties. The statutory safeguards, under the\n\n     <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_519\">Arbitration Act</a> provide a checklist and a counterbalance and\n\n     thereby rule out inequality for the arbitrating parties.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_44\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155925871\" id=\"span_37\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69965182\" id=\"span_38\">34.

It was held that <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_525\">Section\n\n12(5)</a> read with the Seventh Schedule does not bar retired\n\ngovernment employees, from serving as arbitrators. It however\n\nheld that in the case of a government contract where the authority\n\nto appoint arbitrators rests with a government entity, it is\n\nimperative to have a ‘broad-based’ panel to secure the principle of\n\nimpartiality and independence of the Arbitrator.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"69965182\" id=\"span_46\">It is relevant to\n\nnote that the basis on which such a panel was upheld in\n\n<a href=\"/doc/69965182/\" id=\"a_526\">Voestalpine</a>(supra) was that the persons who have been\n\nnominated are subject to the rigours of <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_527\">Section 12</a>.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\">36.     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155925871\" id=\"span_47\">In <a href=\"/doc/155925871/\" id=\"a_528\">Perkins</a> (supra), the question before the 3-judge bench\n\nwas whether the Managing Director of the Respondent, who is\n\nineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_529\">Section 12(5)</a>\n\nread with Seventh Schedule, can nominate the sole arbitrator.\n\nTherefore, the Court was only concerned with the authority or\n\npower of the Managing Director and cannot be understood to\n\nconclude that unilateral appointments are impermissible. The\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                            Page 19 of 24</span>\n\f      distinction between ‘ineligibility’ and ‘unilateral’ appointments\n\n      must be borne in mind.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">      37.

In CORE(supra), the three-judge bench endorsed an\n\n      arbitration clause that provided for current and former\n\n      employees of one party to be appointed by the other party by\n\n      asserting that such an appointment was balanced by an equal\n\n      power of selection granted to the other party. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"58812878\" id=\"span_49\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"63871350\" id=\"span_50\">As already noted by\n\n      Justice Narasimha, the Court relied on <a href=\"/doc/63871350/\" id=\"a_530\">Union of India Vs.

In such cases,\n\none party may wield disproportionate influence over the selection\n\nof the arbitrator, undermining the fairness of the arbitration\n\nprocess. This imbalance of power makes it imperative that the\n\nappointment process be scrutinized carefully to uphold the\n\nprinciple of equality, as laid down in <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_533\">Section 18</a> of the Arbitration\n\nAct. Therefore, the Court erred in refusing to exercise its power\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_534\">Section 11(6)</a> to appoint an arbitrator, in such a case of\n\ncomplete lack of consensus between the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">39.     Concerns about the presumed bias of an arbitrator\n\nnominated by the claimant must also be tested against the\n\nobjective standard of independence and impartiality, provided\n\nunder the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_535\">Seventh Schedule of the Arbitration Act</a>. The\n\nappointment of arbitrators must scrupulously be made through\n\nthe consent of the parties. The recourse to <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_536\">Section 11</a> must not\n\nbe readily inferred in view of the remedies contained in <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_537\">Sections\n\n12</a>, <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_538\">13</a>, <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_539\">14</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1294263/\" id=\"a_540\">15</a> of the Act. In any case, the scrutiny on whether\n\nto intervene has to be on a case-to-case basis.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">40.     Arbitration without party autonomy prevailing, will be\n\nlike a redressal mechanism, without spirit. Liberty for the parties\n\nopting for Arbitration without equality being enshrined from the\n\nstage of inception to conclusion would be like a soulless process.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                           Page 21 of 24</span>\n\f<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_541\">The Arbitration Act</a> as discussed earlier provides for adequate\n\nguard rails to ensure that the arbitrator(s) to be appointed are\n\ncapable of independently discharging their responsibilities. The\n\nSixth and Seventh Schedule requires the proposed arbitrator(s)\n\nto disclose any circumstances that might reasonably affect their\n\nimpartiality, including relationship with the parties, the counsel\n\nor the subject matter of the dispute.      In this scenario, since\n\nparties opt for the arbitration route to avoid redressal in Court,\n\nminimal judicial intervention should be the norm.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_51\">41.     In my view, all unilateral appointments must not be\n\ndeclared void by way of a declaration of this Court. The 2015\n\nAmendment in <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_542\">Section 12(5)</a> itself provides for a specific waiver\n\ni.e. (a) an express consent in writing and (b)the consent must be\n\nobtained after the dispute has arisen. Therefore, it is abundantly\n\nclear that an agreement between the parties(provided it satisfies\n\nthe specific waiver requirements under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_543\">Section 12(5)</a>) can\n\neffectively cure any concerns about impartiality or independence\n\nin such cases.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_52\">42.     Adequate safeguards are provided within the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_544\">Arbitration\n\nAct</a> to ensure a level playing field as discussed in the preceding\n\nparagraphs and therefore to answer the question in this\n\nreference, a search within the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_545\">Arbitration Act</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">                           Page 22 of 24</span>\n\fshould first be made. In my view, the obligations of fair treatment\n\nshould be grounded in the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_546\">Arbitration Act</a> rather than in the\n\nprinciples of Constitutional or administrative law. The choice of\n\nthe parties in the agreement should not be disregarded without\n\ncompelling reasons, through judicial intervention especially\n\nwhen the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_547\">Arbitration Act</a> provides clear remedies under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_548\">Sections\n\n12</a>, <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_549\">13</a>, <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_550\">14</a>, and <a href=\"/doc/1294263/\" id=\"a_551\">15</a> of the Arbitration Act. It is only when there\n\nis a complete lack of consensus between the parties that the\n\nCourt’s interference under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_552\">Section 11</a> could be justified.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_53\">43.     Flowing from the above discussion, the following are the\n\nconclusions :-\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">      a) <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_553\">Section 18</a> applies to all stages of arbitration including\n\n      the stage of appointment of an arbitrator. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_554\">The Arbitration\n\n      Act</a> does not provide for any special treatment to the\n\n      government irrespective of whether the arbitration is by or\n\n      against the government.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">  b) Unilateral appointment of Arbitrators is permissible as per\n\n      the legislative scheme of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_555\">Arbitration Act</a>. There is a\n\n      distinction   between      ‘ineligibility’   and   ‘unilateral’\n\n      appointment of arbitrators. As long as an arbitrator\n\n      nominated by a party is eligible under the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_556\">Seventh Schedule\n\n      of the Act</a>, the appointment (unilateral or otherwise), should\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_56\">                           Page 23 of 24</span>\n\f    be permissible.   It is only in cases of a complete lack of\n\n    consensus that the court should exercise its power under\n\n    <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_557\">Section 11(6)</a> of the Arbitration Act to appoint an\n\n    independent and impartial arbitrator as per <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_558\">Section 11(8)</a>\n\n    read with <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_559\">Section 12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_560\">18</a> of the Arbitration Act. At the\n\n    appointment stage, the scope of judicial intervention is\n\n    otherwise extremely narrow.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">  c) The independence and impartiality of the arbitrator must be\n\n    examined within the statutory framework of the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_561\">Arbitration\n\n    Act</a>, particularly <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_562\">Section 18</a> read with 12(5).

Introduction\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_58\">1.      The issue before us is whether the appointment process under an arbitration\n\nagreement, which allows a party who has an interest in the dispute to unilaterally\n\nappoint a sole arbitrator or curate a panel of arbitrators and mandate that the other\n\nparty select their arbitrator from the panel, is valid in law. Prior to the 2015 Amendment\n\nto <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_571\">Section 12</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996 1, courts permitted such\n\nunilateral constitution of arbitral tribunals by one party. However, post amendment,\n\njudgments oscillated between negative and conditional affirmations. This Constitution\n\nBench is called upon to clarify the correct position, essential for dispelling uncertainty.\n\nThe argument against such an appointment process is based on <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_572\">Sections 12(5)</a> and\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_573\">18</a> of the Act, as well as on public law considerations such as equal treatment of parties\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_574\">Article 14</a>, unfair and unreasonable procedure, and non-arbitrariness.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_59\">2.      I have considered it necessary to locate the obligations of the parties to\n\nconstitute an independent and impartial arbitral tribunal within the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_575\">Indian Contract Act,\n\n1872</a>, 2 and the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_576\">Arbitration Act</a>, and not to apply public law principles evolved in\n\nconstitutional and administrative laws. This is to ensure party autonomy, coupled with\n\nminimal judicial intervention, a foundational principle of dispute resolution through\n\narbitration. When parties choose arbitration over Court proceedings as an exception\n\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_577\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act, they are under a duty to constitute an\n\nindependent and impartial tribunal as an effective substitute, failing which the\n\narbitration agreement will be void as opposed to public policy under <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_578\">Section 23</a> of the\n\nContract Act. This obligation is the Second Principle that governs arbitration. Whether\n\nthe agreement is compliant with the duty to constitute an independent and impartial\n\n\n\n\n1 Hereinafter “the Act” or “<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_579\">Arbitration Act</a>”.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">2 Hereinafter “the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_580\">Contract Act</a>”.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_62\">                                                3</span>\n\ftribunal and not opposed to the public policy effecting access to justice is always\n\ndetermined by the Court. This is the third principle. There is a clear statutory\n\nincorporation of these three principles in the Contract Act and the Arbitration Act. I\n\nbelieve that enduring answers to the questions before this Constitution Bench will lie\n\nin the balance between these principles.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">2.1    Enquiry into disputes relating to legality and propriety of a contractual clause\n\nenabling unilateral appointment of arbitral tribunal arises when an application under\n\n<a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_581\">Section 11(6)</a> for appointment or under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_582\">Section 14</a> of the Arbitration Act for substitution\n\nare brought before the Court. It is at this stage that the Court will examine the\n\narbitration clause to ensure independence and impartiality. It will be impermissible for\n\nthe court to intervene at a stage prior to that, to declare agreements to be void as an\n\nadvanced ruling. This is to ensure party autonomy, particularly when the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_583\">Arbitration\n\nAct</a> itself enables parties to waive certain mandatory provisions such as <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_584\">Section 12(5)</a>\n\nof the Arbitration Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_63\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_64\">B.     Access to Justice\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_65\">3.     Access to justice constitutes the very foundation of democratic governance,\n\nserving as the linchpin of a fair and equitable society. Our Constitution, in its wisdom,\n\nestablishes a comprehensive judicial architecture, encompassing the Supreme Court,\n\nthe High Courts, and subordinate courts as public law and ordinary civil/criminal\n\nremedies to safeguard this inalienable right. Furthermore, specialised tribunals and\n\ncommissions are constituted to adjudicate specific disputes, leveraging expertise and\n\nfacilitating expeditious resolution, thereby guaranteeing swift and effective justice to\n\nall. It is imperative that these judicial remedies are effective. In fact, effectiveness of\n\njudicial remedies is a constitutional mission, and it is always a work in progress for the\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_63\">                                            4</span>\n\fSupreme Court to ensure that the remedies are impartial, readily accessible,\n\nfinancially viable, swiftly administered, and comprehensively tailored.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">4.      Beyond the realm of public law and ordinary civil/criminal remedies, as\n\nindicated herein above, parties to a dispute may elect to resolve their differences\n\nthrough mutually agreed procedures, crystallised in the form of contractual\n\nagreements. It is permissible in law to have such alternative dispute resolution\n\nmechanisms through contract. <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_585\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act protects these alternative\n\ndispute resolution agreements through arbitration between contesting parties,\n\nfostering an environment conducive to expeditious and amicable dispute resolution.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_67\">C.      Arbitration as Substitute Dispute Resolution\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_68\">5.      <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_586\">The Arbitration and Conciliation Act, 1996</a> provides a simple, efficient, cost-\n\neffective, confidential, and a fair dispute resolution remedy by empowering the parties\n\nto choose their arbitrators and also the procedure for conduct of the arbitral\n\nproceedings. Recognising party autonomy, <a href=\"/doc/1091250/\" id=\"a_587\">Section 5</a> <a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_588\">3</a> of the Act restrains judicial\n\nauthorities from intervening with the arbitral remedy except as provided in the Act. The\n\nmandate of <a href=\"/doc/1091250/\" id=\"a_589\">Section 5</a> is reflected in a number of judicial decisions of this Court,\n\nenabling easy access to arbitration by merely examining the existence of an arbitration\n\nagreement between the parties, and at the same time refraining from interfering with\n\nthe arbitral award on grounds other than manifest arbitrariness or against public\n\npolicy. 4\n\n\n\n\n3 <a href=\"/doc/1091250/\" id=\"a_590\">Section 5</a> of the Act reads:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">      “5.

Obligations of parties to the Arbitration Agreement to constitute an\n       independent and an impartial Arbitral Tribunal\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_108\">9.     I will now examine the principles that impinge upon the freedom to contract and\n\nlimit of party autonomy. Before that, a necessary distinction needs to be drawn for\n\nclarity and certainty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_109\">9.1    Distinct duties of Arbitrators and Arbitrating Parties. There are two distinct\n\nobligations. The first is the obligation of the parties to the agreement, and the second\n\nis the neutrality and objectivity that an arbitrator must maintain. The obligations on the\n\nparties to the arbitration agreement to constitute an independent and impartial arbitral\n\ntribunal is distinct from the objectivity and impartiality that an arbitrator(s) must himself\n\nmaintain. The foundation of the former is within the statutory framework, coupled with\n\ncertain public policy considerations. The latter is simply the duty to act judicially, it is\n\nnot superimposed by any statute or public policy, but arises because of the very nature\n\nof the calling, i.e., to judge what is right and what is wrong. Though the constitution of\n\nthe arbitral tribunal is inextricably connected to the agreement between the parties,\n\ncore duties of the arbitrator(s) in deciding the case is independent of the contract. <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_630\">The\n\nArbitration Act</a> provisions grounds to challenge appointment of an arbitrator at various\n\nstages, including after making of the award. The issue with which we are concerned\n\nis not about the arbitrator or the award of the arbitral tribunal, but about the legality of\n\nthe contractual arbitration clause that enables one of the parties to unilaterally\n\nconstitute the arbitral tribunal. Clarity about the issue arising for consideration is\n\nnecessary to focus on the right questions that we must ask.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_110\">10.    Therefore, to understand the question relating to the legality of the contractual\n\nclause, we must get to the first principles that govern arbitration agreements, which in\n\nturn takes us to the first principles of law of contract.\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_74\">                                             9</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_111\">\f11.     Freedom of Contract and its limitations under <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_631\">Contract Act</a>. The foundation of\n\nthe law of contract is in the freedom to contract and its enforceability in law. <a href=\"/doc/1430346/\" id=\"a_632\">Sections\n\n2(a)</a>, (b), and (d), of the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_633\">Contract Act</a> define ‘proposal’, ‘promise’ and ‘consideration’,\n\nand reflect the autonomy of the parties declaring the terms and conditions and\n\nreciprocal promises. <a href=\"/doc/85567/\" id=\"a_634\">Section 2(e)</a> provides that “Every promise and every set of\n\npromises, forming the consideration for each other, is an agreement”. Agreements are\n\ncontracts if they are made by the free consent of parties35, and free consent 36 exists\n\nwhen     it   is   not    caused     by   coercion 37,   undue   influence 38,   fraud 39   and\n\nmisrepresentation 40. Furthermore, agreements attain the status of contracts only if\n\nthey are made for lawful consideration and with a lawful object. 41 The consideration or\n\nobject of an agreement is lawful only when it is not opposed to public policy. It is here\n\nthat the duty and obligation of the Court arises as it is the exclusive province of the\n\nCourt to decide if an agreement is in consonance with public policy or not.

Brojo Nath\n\nGanguly</a> 47 where Court expounded on ‘unconscionability’ as a facet of public policy.\n\nThis ground is particularly relevant for our analysis as Mr. Banerji has pointed out\n\nseveral US cases wherein arbitration agreements that allow one party to control the\n\npool of potential arbitrators were held to be unconscionable.

It has\n\nenvisaged for this principle to apply in cases where the weaker party does not exercise\n\nmeaningful choice and must agree to a standard form of contract. 48 However, the\n\nCourt has also circumscribed the applicability of unconscionability and held that it will\n\nnot apply when parties have equal or almost equal bargaining power, such as in\n\ncommercial transactions and contracts between businessmen.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"542988\" id=\"span_85\">49 The inapplicability of\n\n‘unconscionability’ to commercial contracts has been reiterated by this Court in the\n\n\n\n\n46 ibid, 524-566; <a href=\"/doc/542988/\" id=\"a_654\">P.

In public law remedies, this\n\nissue was considered when administrative tribunals were constituted for the first time\n\nto substitute ordinary remedies.

Two categories of challenge under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_669\">Section 12</a>. The effect of the 2015\n\nAmendment is that there are now two separate categories for the parties to challenge\n\nthe appointment of an arbitrator. First, a challenge under <a href=\"/doc/135168/\" id=\"a_670\">Section 12(3)</a> to an appointed\n\narbitrator based on justifiable doubts regarding his independence and impartiality, by\n\nusing the procedure under <a href=\"/doc/862520/\" id=\"a_671\">Section 13</a>. While <a href=\"/doc/135168/\" id=\"a_672\">Section 12(3)</a> itself remains unamended,\n\nthe insertion of Explanation 1 in <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_673\">Section 12(1)</a>, read with the Fifth Schedule, now\n\nenlists the circumstances that give rise to justifiable doubts as to an arbitrator’s\n\nindependence and impartiality. The Fifth Schedule contains 34 entries that have been\n\nadopted from the Red and Orange Lists of the IBA Guidelines. A written disclosure on\n\nthese grounds must be made in the form provided in the Sixth Schedule. 51\n\n22.1    The second category is under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_674\">Section 12(5)</a> which declares certain persons to\n\nbe ‘ineligible’ to be appointed as arbitrators. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"57641171\" id=\"span_93\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"35443395\" id=\"span_94\">These ineligibilities are enlisted in the\n\nSeventh Schedule. The provision itself stipulates that such ineligibility is\n\nnotwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary. In these situations, the ineligibility\n\nof the person to act as an arbitrator is a matter of law and goes to the root of their\n\nappointment 52. As they are de jure unable to perform their function, their mandate\n\nautomatically terminates under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_675\">Section 14(1)(a)</a>, and the appointment need not be\n\n\n\n51 <a href=\"/doc/35443395/\" id=\"a_676\">HRD Corporation (Marcus Oil and Chemical Division) v.

The difference between these categories is important to bear in mind. In the\n\nformer situation, there is no bar to the appointment itself, but the appointment may\n\nlater be challenged before the arbitral tribunal. On the other hand, in the latter situation,\n\nthe Act places an express bar on the appointment of certain ‘ineligible’ persons as\n\narbitrators, notwithstanding any prior agreement to the contrary. Their appointment is\n\ninvalid from the very beginning, and in the application before the court under <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_682\">Section\n\n14</a>, the only question is whether the arbitrator falls under one of the categories of the\n\nSeventh Schedule and whether there is an agreement waiving the applicability of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_683\">Section 12(5)</a> in accordance with the proviso. 55\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_149\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"35443395\" id=\"span_97\">24.

This Court in <a href=\"/doc/35443395/\" id=\"a_684\">HRD v.

The\n\nobject and purpose of <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_693\">Section 12(5)</a> is to secure the independence and impartiality of\n\nthe arbitral tribunal by placing a restriction on the choice of the parties in appointing\n\ncertain persons as arbitrators, who are declared as “ineligible” under the Seventh\n\nSchedule. <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_694\">Section 12</a> is therefore a statutory incorporation of the public policy principle\n\nof access to justice that I have delineated hereinabove, and the Fifth and Seventh\n\nSchedules enlist the situations when the appointment of certain persons could and\n\nwould conflict with the independence of the tribunal. The courts can examine whether\n\nan appointment procedure accords or violates this provision. Therefore, the court will\n\nbe guided by <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_695\">Section 12</a> of the Act, read with the Fifth and Seventh Schedules, to\n\ndetermine whether arbitration agreements providing for unilateral appointments and\n\npanel appointments are opposed to the public policy duty on the parties to appoint an\n\nindependent tribunal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_155\">26.

What must be noted is that the court exercises the discretion under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_724\">Section\n\n11(8)</a> while adjudicating on the facts in each case. However, the provision does not, in\n\nany manner, impose a blanket prohibition that is justifiable on a public policy\n\nconsideration against unilateral appointments or appointments from a panel\n\nmaintained by one party. All it does is that it leaves it open for the parties to the\n\nagreement to apply to the court if there are concerns regarding the neutrality or\n\nobjectivity of arbitrators appointed through the agreed upon procedure. The court will\n\nthen examine the facts, circumstances, material, and evidence in every application\n\nbefore it, to determine whether a case is made out to appoint an arbitrator de hors the\n\nagreement, but such ruling will be specific to that case rather than a declaration\n\nprohibiting such agreements altogether.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_166\">34.    Assertions that a person’s freedom to contract is grounded only in common law\n\nand statute, are ostensible at best. The freedom of speech and expression engrafted\n\nin <a href=\"/doc/1378441/\" id=\"a_725\">Article 19(1)(a)</a> of the Constitution and significantly, the freedom to carry on\n\noccupation, trade and business <a href=\"/doc/935769/\" id=\"a_726\">Article 19(1)(g)</a> read with the constitutional right to\n\nproperty under <a href=\"/doc/120077007/\" id=\"a_727\">Article 300A</a>, do provide a substantial foundation for a constitutional\n\nbasis for the ‘freedom to contract’. The statutory framework governing contract laws,\n\nstatutory restrictions on what contracts are lawful, what contracts are void and what\n\nconsiderations are lawful do have significant constitutional moorings. <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_728\">Sections 23</a> to\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1295756/\" id=\"a_729\">30</a> of the Contract Act reflect constitutional colours, when they declare that agreements\n\nin restraint of trade, agreements in restraint of legal proceedings, agreements\n\nrestraining marriage etc are void. Similarly, this Court has employed constitutional\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                                          22</span>\n\ftools from Part III and Part IV of the Constitution to breathe fresh life into the term\n\n“public policy” in the context of <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_730\">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act. 61\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_167\">35.    This constitutional re-conceptualisation of contract law is not without relevance\n\nin the case. The freedom to contract out of traditional court based remedies and to opt\n\nfor arbitral remedies is informed and regulated by constitutional considerations. To this\n\nend, what subject matters are arbitrable and how remedies are to be designed within\n\nthe universe of arbitration, are informed not only by considerations of freedom to\n\ncontract, but also a larger constitutional responsibility to provide access to justice.\n\n‘Party autonomy’ encapsulated within a larger freedom to contract must tempered with\n\na person’s right to access justice and corresponding duty on the State to provide\n\naccess to justice.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_168\">36.    Access to justice in this context is not a mere avenue for dispute redressal. It\n\nmeans access to timely, efficacious, and equitable system for dispute resolution.\n\nArbitration though is often referred to as an alternative form of dispute resolution, it\n\nhas, in practice evolved into a substituted form of dispute resolution. Therefore, arbitral\n\nremedies too must withstand constitutional scrutiny and provide access to arbitral\n\ntribunals that are not just independent and impartial, but also seem independent and\n\nimpartial. In this scheme, it matters not whether the tribunal and its composition is\n\ndecided by the State, PSUs, other State actors, or private entities. The underlying\n\nprinciple is that when party autonomy is exercised to appoint members to the arbitral\n\ntribunal, members who are so appointed are not just independent, but must also seem\n\nto be independent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_169\">\n\n\n<span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"268805\" id=\"span_119\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"477313\" id=\"span_120\">61 <a href=\"/doc/477313/\" id=\"a_731\">Brojo Nath Ganguly</a> (supra); <a href=\"/doc/268805/\" id=\"a_732\">Delhi Transport Corporation v.

This constitutional concern for access to justice which is not only in fact\n\nunbiased and fair, but also seems and appears unbiased and fair, is far more relevant\n\nto people who do not at present find place in the arbitration universe that is\n\npredominantly populated by big businesses, the mega-affluent contractors, and the\n\nmillionaires. Access to justice, and by implication effective arbitral remedies are\n\nequally relevant for “the common man, for the poor and the humble, for those who\n\nhave businesses at stake, for the &quot;butcher, the baker and the candlestick maker&#x27;”. 62\n\n\nH.

For the sake of brevity\n\nand focus, the principles and main holding of each judgment may be stated as follows:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">  I.    First, it is important to note that <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_737\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act is a mandatory and\n\n        non-derogable provision, which overrides the arbitration agreement between\n\n        the parties that prescribes a person who is ineligible to act as an arbitrator.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"981675\" id=\"span_122\">However, the proviso enables parties to waive its applicability through an\n\n        express agreement in writing between them, subsequent to the dispute. 63\n\n II.

In TRF Limited, 69 a three-judge bench of this Court considered the validity of\n\n         an arbitration clause which provided that the Managing Director of the\n\n         respondent would act as the arbitrator or nominate the sole arbitrator. The issue\n\n         before the Court was whether the Managing Director, who is ineligible to act as\n\n         an arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_741\">Section 12(5)</a> read with the Seventh Schedule, can\n\n         nominate the sole arbitrator. 70 The Court answered this question in the negative\n\n         by relying on various judgments on delegation of authority and the maxim “qui\n\n         facit per alium facit per se” (what one does through another is done by\n\n         oneself). 71 Thus, the Court extended the ineligibility to act as an arbitrator under\n\n\n\n\n65 ibid, paras 24 and 25.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_174\">66 ibid, para 26.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_175\">67 ibid, paras 27 and 28.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_176\">68 ibid, paras 29 and 30.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_177\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"192167806\" id=\"span_126\">69 <a href=\"/doc/192167806/\" id=\"a_742\">TRF Limited v.

Further, no reasonable\n\n           apprehension or justifiable doubt was raised regarding the nominated\n\n           arbitrator’s independence and impartiality to warrant an appointment by the\n\n           court de hors the arbitration agreement under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_745\">Section 11(8)</a> of the Act.\n\nIV.        Subsequently, in Perkins, 72 the Court interpreted and relied on the ruling in TRF\n\n           (supra) while considering an arbitration agreement where the Chairman and\n\n           Managing Director (CMD) of the respondent could appoint the sole arbitrator. It\n\n           held that even if the arbitration agreement does not provide for the CMD to act\n\n           as an arbitrator, as was the case in TRF (supra), he remains incompetent to\n\n           nominate the arbitrator, which stems from his interest in the outcome of dispute,\n\n           thereby creating a possibility of bias. 73 The Court held that the ineligibility to\n\n           appoint is a result of operation of law, as a person who is ineligible to act as an\n\n           arbitrator must not have an exclusive role in charting the course of dispute\n\n           resolution by appointing the arbitrator. 74 However, in cases where both parties\n\n           can nominate an arbitrator of their choice, the advantage to any one party would\n\n           get counter-balanced. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"155925871\" id=\"span_128\">75 The problems in the reasoning in TRF (supra), i.e., the\n\n           absence of a statutory source for ineligibility to appoint, and justifiable doubts\n\n           regarding the nominated arbitrator’s independence and impartiality to warrant\n\n\n\n\n72 <a href=\"/doc/155925871/\" id=\"a_746\">Perkins Eastman Architects DPC v.

A three-judge bench in CORE 76 interpreted the arbitration clause 64(3)(b) of the\n\n       GCC in railway contracts, which provides for appointment of a three-member\n\n       arbitral tribunal from a panel of retired officers maintained by the Railways. The\n\n       General Manager, Railways would send a list of at least four names, from which\n\n       the other party must suggest at least two names as its nominee. The General\n\n       Manager would then appoint one of these two persons as the contractor’s\n\n       nominee, and appoint the balance arbitrators, including the presiding arbitrator,\n\n       from within or outside the panel. The Court held that appointment of arbitrators\n\n       must be as per the arbitration agreement, 77 and that appointment from a panel\n\n       of retired officers is not prohibited under <a href=\"/doc/1265271/\" id=\"a_748\">Section 12(5)</a> of the Act. 78 It held that\n\n       the rulings in TRF (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/155925871/\" id=\"a_749\">Perkins</a> (supra) will not apply to the present case\n\n       as the advantage accruing to the Railways through appointing their arbitrator is\n\n       counter-balanced by the contractor’s right to choose two names from the list,\n\n       out of which the General Manager will appoint at least one of them as the\n\n       contractor’s nominee. 79 There are three noteworthy aspects of this reasoning:</span>\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_44\">       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"58812878\" id=\"span_132\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"63871350\" id=\"span_133\">first, that the Court relies on <a href=\"/doc/63871350/\" id=\"a_750\">Parmar Construction</a> (supra) and <a href=\"/doc/58812878/\" id=\"a_751\">Pradeep Vinod\n\n       Construction</a> (supra) while ruling on adherence to the appointment procedure\n\n       in the agreement, but does not consider that these cases interpreted Clause 64\n\n       of the GCC prior to the amendment in law and the arbitration clause pursuant</span></span>\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_185\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"28100587\" id=\"span_134\">76 Central Organisation for <a href=\"/doc/28100587/\" id=\"a_752\">Railway Electrification v.

International Perspective\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_202\">41.    Having noted the perspective of this Court on the duty of the parties to appoint\n\nan independent tribunal after the 2015 Amendment, and before concluding, it is\n\nnecessary to examine the international perspective on the issue. I must caveat that\n\nconsideration of foreign laws and judgments of foreign jurisdiction do not have a direct\n\nbearing on the interpretation of our laws. At the most they grant us a perspective and\n\nnothing more. Further I will demonstrate that there is no single, universal standard on\n\nthis issue; rather, each country has taken a different stance based on its own laws,\n\npolicies, legal culture, and dispute resolution framework. Consequently, there is no\n\nuniform application or consistency in legal principles on this matter. Therefore, while\n\nforeign laws and precedents may provide insights, they should be referenced\n\ncautiously, acknowledging that differences in context may make direct reliance\n\ninappropriate.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_203\">42.    Legislative framework of certain foreign jurisdictions. Internationally, party\n\nautonomy is highly valued in appointing arbitrators and composing arbitral tribunals.\n\nFor example, the New York Convention 90 (Article V(1)(d)) permits refusal of award\n\nrecognition if the tribunal&#x27;s composition deviates from party agreement, underscoring\n\n\n\n\n90 Convention on the Recognition and Enforcement of Foreign Arbitral Awards, 1958.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_156\">                                                30</span>\n\fthe primacy of party autonomy. The UNCITRAL Model Law also upholds party\n\nautonomy as a core principle in tribunal composition. Similarly, Section 5 91 of Federal\n\nArbitration Act of US accords primacy to appointment procedure as agreed to between\n\nthe parties. The arbitration agreement must be in accordance with <a href=\"/doc/738672/\" id=\"a_777\">Section 2</a> which\n\nrequires the same to be, “valid, irrevocable, and enforceable, save upon such grounds\n\nas exists at law or in equity for the revocation of any contract.” This has been used by\n\nUS courts to source ‘unconscionability’ as a ground to test the validity of an arbitration\n\nagreement. 92\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_204\">43.     <a href=\"/doc/1456610/\" id=\"a_778\">Article 2</a> of Geneva Protocol on Arbitration Clauses93 provides that “the\n\nconstitution of arbitral tribunal, shall be governed by the will of the parties and by the\n\nlaw of the country in whose territory the arbitration takes place.” Article 1028 <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_779\">of Code\n\nof Civil Procedure</a>, Netherlands provides that in case the arbitration agreement gives\n\none of the parties to the dispute a privileged position in appointing arbitrators, then,\n\nthe other party may, despite the agreement, request the relevant court to appoint an\n\narbitrator. Similarly, Section 1034 of German <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_780\">Code of Civil Procedure</a> stipulates that if\n\nin the arbitration agreement, one of the parties has a preponderant right in so far as\n\ncomposition of the arbitral tribunal is concerned, thereby putting the other party at a\n\ndisadvantage, then such latter party can request the court to appoint an arbitrator in\n\n\n\n\n91 Section 5, Federal Arbitration Act. It reads as:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">       <a href=\"/doc/1091250/\" id=\"a_781\">Section 5</a>.

The analysis of foreign legislations shows that while party autonomy is\n\nrecognised in appointment and composition of an arbitral tribunals, certain national\n\nlaws explicitly prohibit unilateral appointments that disadvantage one party.

However, at the same time, there are pronouncements which frown upon\n\nunilaterality in matters of appointment of arbitrator/arbitral tribunal. For instance, in one\n\nSwiss decision 98, it has been held:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">      “The Federal Tribunal…has developed principles, under which conditions\n      an arbitral tribunal sufficiently safeguards impartial and independent\n      adjudication. The most important of these principles….is that no party may\n      have a preponderant influence on the appointment of the tribunal.”\n                                                                       (emphasis supplied)\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_213\">49.     American Courts have also dealt with this issue. Despite there being no express\n\nstatutory proscription against unilaterality in matters of appointment, in one of its\n\ndecisions, the Massachusetts District Court remarked that “both the parties to a\n\ndispute must have an equal right to participate in the appointment process.” 99 Similarly,\n\nin another case, 100 the Supreme Court of Alabama invalidated an arbitration\n\nagreement as being unconscionable for the reason that it excluded one party from the\n\nappointment process. Further, in Hooters of America, Inc. v. Phillips 101, the arbitration\n\nclause was held to be against rules of neutrality and the award refused enforcement\n\nbecause one party was given exclusive control over the panel of potential arbitrators\n\nfrom which the other party could select its nominee arbitrator.

Hooters materially breached the arbitration agreement by\n      promulgating rules so egregiously unfair as to constitute a complete default\n      of its contractual obligation to draft arbitration rules and to do so in good\n      faith. Hooters and Phillips agreed to settle any disputes between them not\n      in a judicial forum, but in another neutral forum -- arbitration. Their\n      agreement provided that Hooters was responsible for setting up such a\n      forum by promulgating arbitration rules and procedures. To this end,\n      Hooters instituted a set of rules in July 1996. The Hooters rules when taken\n      as a whole, however, are so one-sided that their only possible purpose is\n      to undermine the neutrality of the proceeding.”\n\nFurther, on the question of unilateral composition of panel, the court remarked:\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">      “The Hooters rules also provide a mechanism for selecting a panel of three\n      arbitrators that is crafted to ensure a biased decisionmaker. Rule 8. The\n      employee and Hooters each select an arbitrator, and the two arbitrators in\n      turn select a third. Good enough, except that the employee&#x27;s arbitrator and\n      the third arbitrator must be selected from a list of arbitrators created\n      exclusively by Hooters. This gives Hooters control over the entire panel and\n      places no limits whatsoever on whom Hooters can put on the list. Under the\n      rules, Hooters is free to devise lists of partial arbitrators who have existing\n      relationships, financial or familial, with Hooters and its management. In fact,\n      the rules do not even prohibit Hooters from placing its managers\n      themselves on the list. Further, nothing in the rules restricts Hooters from\n      punishing arbitrators who rule against the company by removing them from\n      the list. Given the unrestricted control that one party (Hooters) has over the\n      panel, the selection of an impartial decisionmaker would be a surprising\n      result.”\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_215\">50.     Similarly, in Murray v. United Food and Commercial Workers Union 102, the\n\nDistrict Court of Maryland held the arbitration agreement to be unconscionable\n\nbecause the arbitrator was selected from a list of potential arbitrators curated by one\n\n\n102 289 F.3d 297 (4th Cir.2002).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_216\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_160\">                                            34</span>\n\fof the parties to the dispute. In doing so, the court observed that, “Although an\n\narbitration agreement will not be invalidated for failure to “replicate the judicial forum”,\n\nwe again refuse to enforce an agreement so utterly lacking in the rudiments of even-\n\nhandedness.” This line of reasoning continues in McMullen v. Meijer, Inc. 103 where the\n\nagreement granted one party unilateral control over the pool of potential arbitrators.\n\nThere, the court noted that, “when the process used to select the arbitrator is\n\nfundamentally unfair, as in this case, the arbitral forum is not an effective substitute for\n\na judicial forum, and there is no need to present separate evidence of bias or\n\ncorruption.”\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_217\">51.     The importance of composition of a just and proper arbitral tribunal was also\n\nhighlighted by the Supreme Court of West Virginia in Board of Education of Berkley\n\nCounty v. W. Harley Miller, Inc. 104 There, the disputes were to be settled pursuant to a\n\nstandard arbitration provision contained in the construction contract with the Board\n\nwhich provided that disputes shall be decided by arbitration in accordance with the\n\nConstruction Industry Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association. While\n\nthe clause did not give one party unilateral control over the pool of arbitrators, the\n\nCourt nonetheless discussed the issue of unilaterality in matters of appointment and\n\nreasoned that:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">      “A functional analysis of the West Virginia cases which do not favor\n      arbitration demonstrates that this Court would not countenance an\n      arbitration provision by which the parties agree that all disputes will be\n      arbitrated by a panel chosen exclusively by one of the parties. This is the\n      classic rabbits and foxes situation, with the foxes stacking the arbitration\n      panel in their favor.

In this case, we are concerned with the former\n\nand not about the duty of the arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_226\">54.2   Holding that an arbitral tribunal has the “trappings of a court” as it determines\n\nthe competing rights and liabilities of parties through an ‘adjudicatory process’, and\n\ntherefore it must act judicially has the problems of introducing public law principles in\n\ncontractual dispute resolution. This formulation has engendered the application of\n\nprinciples of procedural equality, equal treatment under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_785\">Article 14</a>, fairness, non-\n\narbitrariness, justice, reasonableness, impartiality and bias, all of which have been\n\nsubsequently invoked in the judgment as core values. I tried to locate the obligations\n\nof contracting parties to the arbitration agreement within the province of contract law\n\nand public policy considerations therein. This approach, I believe, is better suited for\n\nthe determination of disputes in arbitration law, as it balances and protects the twin\n\nvalues of party autonomy through judicial restraint, and the duty the parties to\n\nconstitute an independent arbitral tribunal without compromising any one in favour of\n\nthe other.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_227\">54.3   There is a certain difficulty in invoking <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_786\">Section 18</a> of the Act and applying it as\n\nan equality principle mandating equal opportunity to both the contracting parties at the\n\ntime of constituting the arbitral tribunal. <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_787\">Section 18</a> is the obligation of the arbitrator in\n\nconduct of arbitral proceedings. I have already highlighted the important distinction\n\nbetween the duty of the arbitrator to act judicially and the obligations of the parties to\n\nconstitute an independent arbitral tribunal. That apart, the text and the context of\n\n<a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_788\">Section 18</a> as is evident from the scheme of the Act eschews application of <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_789\">Section 18</a>\n\nat the time of appointment. This is clear through two factors: first, through the\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">                                             37</span>\n\fplacement of <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_790\">Section 18</a> in Chapter V, on ‘Conduct of arbitral proceedings’, which\n\ncomes after Chapter III on ‘Composition of arbitral tribunal’; and second, through the\n\nwording of <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_791\">Section 18</a>, which makes it clear that the obligation to treat the parties with\n\nequality is on the arbitral tribunal, rather than the parties to the arbitration agreement.\n\nThe later portion of <a href=\"/doc/1633982/\" id=\"a_792\">Section 18</a>, which mandates that “each party shall be given a full\n\nopportunity to present his case”, further fortifies this view.\n\n54.4   The doctrine of bias and the contours of the test of real likelihood of bias have\n\nbeen discussed through various significant decisions of this Court rendered in the\n\ncontext of administrative and constitutional law. Considering that the issue before us\n\nis the legality of a procedure in the arbitration clause, I find it difficult to apply the\n\ndoctrine of bias or real likelihood of bias at this stage. The real issue is about the\n\nimbalance caused due to unilateral power of one of the parties to the contract to\n\nconstitute the arbitral tribunal. Composition of the arbitral tribunal is part of party\n\nautonomy but there is always the power, coupled with duty, of the court to ensure that\n\nprocedure under the arbitration clause enables constitution of an independent arbitral\n\ntribunal. This scrutiny or enquiry by the court is at the stage of considering the\n\napplication under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_793\">Section 11</a>. I am of the opinion that we cannot, as an advance ruling,\n\ngive a declaration that all arbitration clauses enabling unilateral appointments are null\n\nand void at this stage.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_228\">54.5    I am of the opinion that a priori declaration that arbitration agreements that\n\nprescribe unilateral appointment procedures are invalid can lead to many problems in\n\nthe day-to-day working of arbitral remedies. Particularly for institutions involving\n\nmultiple transactions such as insurance claims, credit card defaults, etc. involving\n\nlarge number of cases but each claim may be of small sum. Our declaration of law\n\nsubstantially covers domestic arbitration, it will not be confined to high and\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">                                            38</span>\n\finternational commercial arbitration. There could also be situations where the\n\nunilateral constitution of the panel of arbitrators could have credible members with\n\nrespect to which no one can have an objection. Rather than declaring that all such\n\nagreements are void, it would be better to strengthen the remedial mechanisms\n\navailable under the Act. This way, the choice of the parties is not completely ignored,\n\nand impartiality and independence of the arbitral tribunal is also ensured through close\n\nscrutiny by courts on a case-to-case basis. In any event, as indicated earlier, the\n\nenquiry about the arbitration clause will be at the stage of <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_794\">Section 11</a>.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_229\">55.    I consider it necessary to note that mere existence of some relationship with\n\nthe appointing authority does not inherently undermine autonomy. For instance, senior\n\nofficers always serve as appellate authorities, and their objectivity is not compromised\n\ndue to their employment. The solution is in the remedies and certainty in law. System\n\nof governances must evolve and recognize the capability in handling distinct\n\nprofessional duties. It is said that the key difference between humans and other beings\n\nlies in their ability to think independently and even against our own interests. While it\n\nis important to acknowledge potential conflicts of interest, it does not mean that the\n\nsystem must bend backward to cater to unending suspicion and doubt. A balance must\n\nbe struck between ensuring confidence in the system and fostering a healthy culture\n\nof independence and objective in functioning. If we focus solely on identifying and\n\ndisqualifying individuals for perceived conflicts, the process becomes an endless cycle\n\nof mistrust.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_230\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_231\">K.     Conclusion\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_232\">56.    With these findings and observations, I summarise my conclusions as follows:\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">                                           39</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">\fI.     Dispute resolution through arbitration encompasses two independent yet\n\n       interdependent principles: contractual freedom as party autonomy and\n\n       statutory obligation as duty to constitute an independent arbitral tribunal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">II.    Party autonomy in making of an arbitration agreement is an essential feature\n\n       of arbitration. It commences with choosing the members of the arbitral\n\n       tribunal, extends to the procedure that would apply for its conduct, and\n\n       concludes with the method by which an award could be challenged before\n\n       a court. It is thus a brooding and guiding spirit of arbitration. Party autonomy\n\n       is sufficiently incorporated in the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_795\">Arbitration Act</a>, along with a restraint on\n\n       judicial intervention.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">III.   The moment parties choose arbitration over ordinary civil proceedings for\n\n       dispute resolution, their duty to establish an independent and impartial\n\n       tribunal arises. The substitution of arbitration in place of civil courts as an\n\n       exception under <a href=\"/doc/1224074/\" id=\"a_796\">Section 28</a> of the Contract Act is only for a forum and not\n\n       for contracting out of the most essential feature of a dispute resolution, i.e.,\n\n       independence and impartiality must exist in every forum. This essential\n\n       feature is the inviolable public policy consideration under <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_797\">Section 23</a> of the\n\n       Contract Act from which the parties cannot opt out. Arbitration agreements\n\n       which are not compliant of this public policy consideration are void under\n\n       <a href=\"/doc/1625889/\" id=\"a_798\">Section 23</a> of the Contract Act. Thus, there is a statutory incorporation of\n\n       duties of the parties to the arbitration agreement.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">IV.    If an arbitration agreement is considered by the court as not enabling\n\n       constitution of an independent and impartial tribunal, any submission that\n\n       the said agreement is a binding contract, or it is in exercise of party\n\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">                                        40</span>\n\f        autonomy is not tenable as such an agreement will be against public policy\n\n        and as such not an enforceable contract.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">V.      In view of the statutory incorporation of these duties, it is not necessary to\n\n        apply public law principles evolved in constitutional and administrative laws.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">        Sourcing these duty obligations from Contract Act and Arbitration Act is\n\n        important to maintain the integrity of the party autonomy and restraint of\n\n        judicial institutions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">VI.     The power to ensure that the arbitration agreement is compliant of the public\n\n        policy requirement of establishing an independent and impartial tribunal is\n\n        always of the Court. This principle is recognised and statutorily incorporated\n\n        in the Contract Act and the Arbitration Act. It is the duty of the court to ensure\n\n        that the arbitration agreement inspires confidence and it will enable\n\n        establishment of an independent and impartial arbitral tribunal.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">VII.    Neither public policy considerations under the <a href=\"/doc/171398/\" id=\"a_799\">Contract Act</a> or the <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_800\">Arbitration\n\n        Act</a> restrain the parties to the arbitration from maintaining a panel of\n\n        arbitrators in any manner. However, arbitration agreements enabling one of\n\n        the parties to unilaterally constitute arbitral tribunal do not inspire confidence\n\n        of independence and may violate the public policy requirement of\n\n        constituting an independent and impartial tribunal. The court will, therefore,\n\n        scrutinise the agreement and hold them to be invalid if it considers it\n\n        appropriate.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">VIII.   The occasion for the court to examine the constitution of the independent\n\n        and impartial tribunal under the arbitration clause will arise when one of the\n\n        parties makes an application under <a href=\"/doc/596725/\" id=\"a_801\">Sections 11</a>, <a href=\"/doc/665266/\" id=\"a_802\">14</a> or 34.
