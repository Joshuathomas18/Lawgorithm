By the order dated 4.4.2009 the Labour\n\nCourt    held   that   dispute   was   maintainable   as   there   was\n\ncommunity of interest and there was employer employee\n\nrelationship between the petitioner and security guards, who\n\nraised the dispute I D No.32/98.

The facts leading to this writ petition are that the\n\nrespondent union raised a dispute on behalf of Security Guards\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                 3</span>\n\n\nemployed through contractor in the petitioner establishment at\n\nNaganathapura Plant and sought for absorption.      The points of\n\nreference are as under:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     (i)   Can the Karnataka Rakshaka And General Workers\n\n           Union 48, MIG 2nd Floor, 2nd Stage, KHB Colony,\n\n           Basaveswaranagara, Bangalore 560 079 prove that\n\n           the Contract of Security by the Administrators of\n\n           M/s.Motor Industries Company Ltd., Naganathapura,\n\n           is non-existent (shyam)?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     (ii) In that case for what relief are the security staff\n\n           eligible?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">The petitioner Management filed application for framing issues\n\nregarding maintainability of the dispute and accordingly by the\n\norder dated 5.10.2000 three preliminary issues were framed,\n\nwhich are as follows:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">  (1) Whether the Karnataka Rakshak &amp; General Workmen\n\n      Union has locus standi to represent the first party\n\n      workmen?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_4\">  (2) Whether the workmen whose names have been mentioned\n\n      in the list along with the point of reference referred by the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">                                  4</span>\n\n\n      Government are the Contract Labourers and if so, without\n\n      abolition of the Contract Labour the dispute raised by the\n\n      first party is maintainable?\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_5\">   (3) Whether there is relationship of employer and employee\n\n      between the first party workmen with the second party\n\n      whose names have been mentioned in the list enclosed\n\n      along with the point of reference as per the provisions of\n\n      the I.D.Act?\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">      3. By the order dated 4.4.2009 the Labour Court held on\n\npreliminary issues that the dispute was maintainable and that\n\nthere is relationship of employer and employee between the\n\npetitioner company and the Security guards engaged by the\n\ncontractor who raised the dispute. It was also held that in view\n\nof holding existence of relationship, Issue No.2 as to contract\n\nlabourers and abolition of the contract labour as per the Contract\n\nLabour (Regulation &amp; Abolition), Act does not assume much\n\nimportance and does not survive for consideration.     This order\n\nwas challenged by the petitioner in W P No.27075/2009 (L-Ter).\n\nThis Court by the order dated 14.09.2009 disposed of the writ\n\npetition on the basis of the memo filed by the petitioner\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">                                5</span>\n\n\nreserving liberty to challenge the order along with the final\n\naward.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">     4.

The learned Senior Counsel appearing for the petitioner\n\nsubmitted that engagement of persons as contract labourers\n\ndoes not create a relationship of master and servant. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"277653\" id=\"span_4\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"28043773\" id=\"span_5\">In this\n\nregard, the learned relied upon 1985(II) L LJ   SC Page 4 (<a href=\"/doc/28043773/\" id=\"a_3\">The\n\nWorkmen of the Food Corporation of India vs., Management of\n\nFood Corporation of India</a>), 1992(1) L L J        SC Page 289\n\n(Deenanath &amp; Ors. vs., National Fertilizers Ltd., &amp; others) and\n\n2001 II L.L.J SC Page 1087 (<a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_4\">Steel Authority of India Ltd.,   &amp;\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">                                 6</span>\n\n\nothers vs., National Union Water Front Workers &amp; others</a>). The\n\ndispute could be raised only by the regular workmen through\n\ntheir union in order to establish community of interest and lend\n\nthe character of an industrial dispute as per <a href=\"/doc/189659891/\" id=\"a_5\">Section 2(k)</a> of the\n\nI.D. Act.   The question of contract labour raising a dispute\n\nagainst the principal employer does not arise. Without abolition\n\nof contract labour, there is no locus standi to the contract labour\n\nto raise a dispute. The prayer made in the claim petition claiming\n\nbenefits such as, same wages, scale of pay, etc., on par with\n\nWatch &amp; Ward staff of MICO, Adugodi show that the respondents\n\nwere not employees of the petitioner but of the contractors. The\n\nobservation of the Labour Court that on the basis of Ex.M13 it\n\ncannot be concluded that they are contract labourers, is contrary\n\nto the document and prayer of the respondent in the claim\n\npetition.   The Labour Court erred in ignoring Exs.M14 &amp; 15\n\nletters and Ex.M18 record of Unique Detective and Security\n\nServices Pvt. Ltd., deducting ESI and PF from salaries of the\n\nrespondents for the year 2007.         WW-1 admitted that no\n\nappointment letters were issued by the petitioner company, that\n\nsalary for the month of July 2007 was received from the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_7\">                                 7</span>\n\n\ncontractor, that the salary of regular workmen are credited to\n\nthe Bank account whereas in respect of WW-1 and others, it is\n\npaid by cash, that there is a separate canteen for contract\n\nlabours, that contractor used to give shoes, uniforms, washing\n\nallowance, HRC and Cycle maintenance allowance, etc.,          The\n\nfinding of the Labour Court on issue No.3 is totally perverse,\n\nopposed to record and suffers from non-application of mind.\n\nThe Labour Court could not have brushed aside documentary\n\nevidence Ex.M-22 to M-24 relating to suit O S No.242/1997 filed\n\nby respondent&#x27;s Union in which status quo order was issued.\n\nMerely because qualification for selection and appointment of\n\nContractor&#x27;s   Security   Personnel   were   prescribed   by   the\n\nmanagement, no inference can be drawn that the respondents\n\nare the direct employees of the petitioner.      No witness has\n\nstated that the signature in Ex.W3 Attendance is that of Mr.P L\n\nMathew. Therefore, the question of Labour Court accepting the\n\ncontention urged during arguments by the respondents counsel\n\nthat it is the signature of Mr.P L Mathew cannot be accepted.\n\nMr.P L Mathew did not work at MICO&#x27;s Naganathapura Plant\n\nduring the period between 7.2.1993 and 1.4.2004.               The\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                                             8</span>\n\n\nobservation in Para-41 goes contrary to record and therefore the\n\nfinding of the Labour Court on issue No.3 is without any basis\n\nand opposed to record.              The civil suit filed by the respondent&#x27;s\n\nUnion is ignored stating that it does not belong to relevant\n\nperiod, which is erroneous. The Labour Court having noticed in\n\nPara 39 that WW1 admitted the statement of PF submitted by\n\nM/s.Unique Detective &amp; Security Services Pvt. Ltd., wrongly\n\nmentioned as M/s.Guardwell Detective Services Pvt. Ltd., could\n\nnot   have      observed         that   there     is    an    employer-employee\n\nrelationship.            Ex.W-70 Duty Rosters are signed by shift-\n\nincharges      of        the   contractor       and    Mr.L   P   Rao   had   only\n\ncountersigned the same. Merely because cap and emblem of\n\nMICO are given to Contract Security Personnel for the purpose of\n\nidentification for security reasons, that does not establish\n\nrelationship        of    master    and     servant      without    documentary\n\nevidence such as, Appointment Orders, Salary Slips, Annual\n\nIncrements Letters, Promotion Letters, etc., issued by the\n\npetitioner.     The specific contention of the management is that\n\nthe Contractors engaged the Respondents and only thereafter\n\nthey started working in the premises of the petitioner to carry\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                                          9</span>\n\n\nout the contractual obligations.                   In fact the management\n\ncontended that from the inception of Naganathapura Plant, the\n\nsecurity activities were carried out by specialized contractors\n\nengaged for this purpose.           The Labour Court failed to appreciate\n\nthat    it   was    for   the   respondents         to   have   produced         the\n\nappointment orders given by the contractors or by anybody else\n\nand it was not for the petitioner Management to produce the\n\nsame.        The Labour Court also ignored the order of the court\n\ndated 11.3.2005 wherein the court has noticed the acceptance\n\nby     the    respondent       workmen       the    employment         offered   by\n\nM/s.Unique         Detective    &amp;   Security        Services    Pvt.     Ltd.,   on\n\nhumanitarian grounds.            The Labour Court failed to appreciate\n\nthat the issue with regard to abolition of contract labour in any\n\nparticular area was required to be decided because only after\n\nabolition, a dispute with regard to sham contract can be raised.\n\nFailure to decide the said issue on the premise that it is not\n\nrequired to be considered, has caused great prejudice to the\n\npetitioner. Mr.P L Mathew has not worked in the Naganathapura\n\nPlant from 7.2.1993 to 1.4.2004 and therefore question of\n\nMr.Mathew, signing the attendance registers does not arise at\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                                   10</span>\n\n\nall. The observation in Para 14 of the order that the respondent\n\nworkmen have been working in the Security &amp; Vigilance\n\nDepartment since production started in the Plant in 1989 is\n\ntotally opposed to the evidence on record.          The finding of the\n\nLabour Court that the workmen continued in spite of change of\n\ncontractors and therefore they have to be held as workmen of\n\nthe petitioner is also not correct having regard to the fact that\n\nthe workmen agreed to accept the employment offered by\n\nM/s.Unique Detective and Security Services Pvt. Ltd., and Ex.M-\n\n18 clearly goes to show that ESI and PF contributions are being\n\ndeducted by the said contractor. Ex.M-22, 23 and 24 clearly go\n\nto show that the respondents had filed a civil suit against the\n\nTerrier Security Systems, Guardwell Detective Services Pvt. Ltd.,\n\nand the petitioner in the year 1997 which itself goes to show the\n\npresence of contractors by their own admissions.           The Labour\n\nCourt   clearly   ignored   the   statements   of    the   respondents\n\nthemselves in Ex.M-23 that they were working continuously\n\nunder Contractors from 1992. WW-3 Mr.Mehaboob Pasha clearly\n\nadmitted that respondents are not members of Mico Karmikara\n\nSangha vide Para 8 of his evidence dated 10.6.2008. He also\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                          11</span>\n\n\nadmitted that at present a Contractor is carrying out Security\n\nServices in the Company&#x27;s Adugodi Plant and petitioner&#x27;s\n\nworkers of Adugodi plant are not parties to this dispute. Thus all\n\nthe evidences which are in favour of the Management are\n\nsystematically ignored by the Labour Court.                 In Para - 21 it is\n\nheld that the dispute is not maintainable but the Labour Court\n\nhad made an attempt to justify raising of the dispute on the\n\nbasis of community of interest vide Para 27. The Labour Court\n\nhas taken into consideration the self-serving evidence of WW-1\n\nand WW3 and ignored the evidence of MW1 without giving valid\n\nreasons. WW1 admitted vide Para 51 that contractor was giving\n\nUniforms, Washing allowance, House Rent Allowance etc., and\n\nthere was a separate canteen for contract labourers, which is\n\nerroneously ignored. The Labour Court misread Ex.W-8 to W-15\n\ncertificates of completion of course by the respondents.                    The\n\nLabour Court could not have ignored order dated 11.03.2005\n\nand   stated    that      relationship    cannot    be    decided    on     such\n\nconditional order when the respondents agreed to work with\n\nM/s.Unique     Detective       &amp;   Security      Services    Pvt.   Ltd.,   The\n\ncontention     of   the     petitioner    that    the    duty   rosters     were\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                   12</span>\n\n\nmaintained   by     supervisors      and    shift-in-charges     of   the\n\ncontractors is not at all looked into even though the said\n\ncontention is supported by the evidence of MW-2, MW-3, MW-4\n\n&amp; MW-5.      The observation in Para 6 that the contract\n\nlabour/respondents were in service from 1989 is repeatedly\n\nnoticed in the order, which is opposed to record in the face of\n\nEx.M-23 and the order of reference.              The conclusion of the\n\nLabour   Court    that   Registers     reveal    that   they   were   not\n\nmaintained by any Contractor is contrary to the admissions\n\nmade by WW2. When the respondents had not produced any\n\nevidence to show that they were appointed on the rolls of the\n\npetitioner, the burden could not have been shifted on the\n\npetitioner to show that the respondents had surrendered their\n\nrights and joined as contract labour.           In para 36 of the order\n\ndated 4.4.2009, the Labour Court presumed that Ex.W1 to W7\n\ncontain the signature of Mr.Mathew MW-1, whereas it has come\n\nin evidence of MW-1 that witness was not working in petitioner&#x27;s\n\nplant from 7.2.1993 to 1.4.2004.</span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_9\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"277653\" id=\"span_13\">8. As regards the award dated 23.08.2012 the learned\n\nsenior counsel submitted that Labour Court ignored several vital\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                   13</span>\n\n\ndocuments such as registration certificate and the contractors&#x27;\n\nlicence as also documents pertaining to ESI &amp; PF deductions,\n\nBio-Data   submitted   by   the    respondent   workmen   to   the\n\ncontractor. The learned Judge did not independently decide the\n\nsham issue based on the elaborate evidence produced by the\n\nmanagement.     Vide order recorded on 05.01.2012 MW1 was\n\nproduced for further cross-examination on merits and thereafter\n\nlot of evidence was let in by the management. The Labour Court\n\nought to have examined the said evidence on sham issue and\n\ngiven a considered finding.   The Labour Court has not decided\n\nthe issue of sham contract in the light of criteria <a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_6\">laid down by</a>\n\nthe Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_7\">Steel Authority of India</a>&#x27;s case.          The\n\ncontention of the petitioner before the Labour Court was that the\n\nrespondents were contract labourers, the contractors had valid\n\nlicence, the petitioner had valid registration under the C L R A\n\nAct and the contracts with the contractors were valid and the\n\nrespondents are not entitled to any relief. WW-1 admitted that\n\nMICO was not paying the contributions towards PF &amp; ESI of the\n\nworkmen. Due weightage to this admission was not given by the\n\nLabour Court while deciding the issue relating to sham contract.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                14</span>\n\n\nAfter the contract with M/s.Terrier Security Systems was\n\nterminated by letter dated 30.9.1997 Ex.M33, the workmen\n\nwere employed by M/s.Guard Well Detective Services Ltd.,.\n\nSubsequent to interim order dated 11.3.2005 workmen were\n\nemployed by M/s.Uniq Detective Services Pvt. Ltd., Such being\n\nthe case, the Labour Court was obviously confused in saying that\n\nUniq Detective Services did not have a licence and therefore the\n\ncontract is sham. The Labour Court wrongly <a href=\"/doc/277653/\" id=\"a_8\">placed reliance upon</a>\n\nRule 32 of Contract Labour (R&amp;A) (Karnataka) Rules, 1974. The\n\nvarious service contracts at Ex.M7, M8, M10, M25, M26, M51,\n\nEx.M67, Ex.M68 clearly go to show that the petitioner had valid\n\ncontracts with various contractors and hence it cannot be said\n\nthat contracts are sham.   The Labour Court in Para 25 of the\n\naward refers to Ex.M-51 to 79 produced by Uniq Detective &amp;\n\nSecurity Services Pvt. Ltd., However, these documents are not\n\nlooked into by the Labour Court.    MW-3 has spoken about the\n\ncontract with Uniq Detective &amp; Security Services Pvt. Ltd., from\n\nthe year 2005 and in Para 24 of his cross-examination he has\n\nstated that when he joined, Uniq Detective &amp; Security Agencies\n\nwere already providing security services in MICO. This aspect\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                 15</span>\n\n\nwas overlooked by the Labour Court while holding that the\n\nwitness did not know what happened earlier to 2005. The issue\n\nregarding whether the contract labour was abolished in security\n\nservices was held to be not relevant in order dated 4.4.2009,it\n\nwas very valid criterion for deciding the maintainability of the\n\ndispute, which is ignored in order dated 4.4.2009 as well as\n\naward dated 23.8.2012.       The observation that the principal\n\nemployer had employed contract labour without registration is\n\nanother glaring error apparent on the face of the record.      The\n\nobservation regarding Ex.M13 is a clear misreading of evidence.\n\nEx.M13 clearly goes to show that dispute is being raised by the\n\ncontract labour. When there was no abolition of contract labour\n\nthe petitioner was entitled to engage contract labour for security\n\nservices.   Merely because dispute is raised, it cannot conclude\n\nthat Management is prevented from engaging contract labour for\n\nsecurity. No relief could have been granted much less the relief\n\nof regularization, that too with retrospective effect granting back\n\nwages. The award is based on the order dated 4.4.2009 which\n\nitself is bad in law. <a href=\"/doc/1595530/\" id=\"a_9\">The Private Security Agencies (Regulation)\n\nAct</a> 2005 and the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_10\">Contract Labour Regulation &amp; Abolition Act</a>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                                  16</span>\n\n\npermit the   security agencies        to   provide   contract security\n\nservices. When the law permits engagement of contract labour\n\nin security services, the Labour Court could not have held that\n\nthe contract is sham and the contract labour engaged by the\n\ncontract labour should be regularized by the principal employer.\n\nThere is no exploitation of contract labour. Thus it is submitted\n\nto set aside both the order dated 4.4.2009 and the judgment\n\nand award dated 23.08.2012.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_10\">     9. On the other hand, the learned senior counsel for the\n\nrespondent submitted that the workmen claim direct relationship\n\nwith the management as direct employees. The workmen were\n\nemployed to discharge and to look after the duties of Security,\n\nVigilance, Safety, Protection and Watch and Ward of the entire\n\nNaganathapura Plant of Bosch Limited. The workmen worked\n\nwithin the premises of Naganathapura. The nature of work, they\n\nwere doing was a part and parcel of manufacturing process,\n\nperennial and permanent in nature.          The wages were paid to\n\nthem by the management of Bosch in pursuance of the order\n\npassed by this Court by issuing cheques directly to the workmen.\n\nAttendance   is   marked    in    the       attendance    register   of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">                                  17</span>\n\n\nNaganathapura Plant and it is being verified every day by the\n\nhead of Security/Watch and Ward Department of Bosch Ltd.,\n\nthrough its officers, Ex.W1 to W7 and wages was calculated on\n\nthat basis.    The workmen were selected and employed by the\n\nManagement of Bosch Limited prescribing qualification.        The\n\nManagement preferred people who worked in the Army and\n\nother Defense Forces and persons selected should satisfy the\n\nphysical and other standards prescribed by the Management.\n\nThe work of the workmen was being supervised by the\n\nManagement of Bosch Limited and Management had powers to\n\ninitiate disciplinary action having disciplinary control over the\n\nworkmen. The quantum of wages which were being paid, were\n\nalso fixed by the Management.         The learned senior counsel\n\nreferred these instances so as to prove that the workmen were\n\ndirect employees of petitioner Management.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_11\">      10.     It is further submitted that the Labour Court by the\n\norder dated 4.4.2009 held that the dispute raised by the first\n\nparty is maintainable, there is a relationship of master and\n\nservant and hence the matter is posted for further evidence of\n\nthe first party in respect of points referred by the government.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                 18</span>\n\n\nThus the only evidence that was permitted was on merits of the\n\nclaims. This Court permitted the Management to withdraw the\n\nwrit petition No.27075/2009 (L), which was as against the order\n\ndated 4.4.2009 with liberty to challenge, if final award goes\n\nagainst the Management.     It is submitted, once the workmen\n\nwere held to be workmen of Bosch Limited, the next question is\n\nto grant relief.    The order dated 04.04.2009 conclusively\n\nestablishes that the workmen are the direct employees of the\n\npetitioner and that there is a relationship of master and servant.\n\nTherefore, the evidence led by the Management after the order\n\npassed on the preliminary issues dated 4.4.2009 cannot be\n\nsustained.   It is clearly got up and a sham contract and those\n\ndocuments were a clear case of paper arrangement and thus the\n\nLabour Court is justified in rejecting the said evidence.     The\n\nissue relating to relationship of employer and employee having\n\nbeen answered in favour of the workmen, the evidence of MW-2,\n\nLt. Col. Kolatkar, M/s. Terror Security Services; (2) Sri Prakash\n\nBayar (MW-3) in respect of Unique Detective &amp; Security\n\nServices; and (3) Sri Chandrashekar (MW-04) of M/s.Guardwell\n\nDetective &amp; Security Services is of no consequence and it is an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">                                      19</span>\n\n\nafter   thought      and   the    documents     produced      are     got   up\n\ndocuments.         Much of the evidence led by the Management MW-\n\n2 to MW-5 after the finding recorded on the main preliminary\n\nissue    clearly    establishes   that    the   entire     evidence    is   an\n\nafterthought and cooked up for the purpose of the case.                 After\n\nthe issue relating to relationship is answered in favour of the\n\nworkmen, the Management became desperate, led evidence of\n\nobliging contractors. MW-2 to MW-5 admitted that they collected\n\nwages payable to the workmen and other dues payable to them\n\nfrom the petitioner and passed on the same to the workmen.\n\nThe Management having invited finding on relationship, it is not\n\nopen for them to contend that the relationship between the\n\npetitioner and contractors is not sham.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_12\">        11. WW-1 Sri M Budihal has spoken to the factual position\n\nof how the persons working in Watch and Ward &amp; Security\n\nDepartments, were recruited.         He has spoken, most of the 72\n\nSecurity    Personnel      were   appointed     in   the    year    1989    in\n\nNaganathapura Plant. Even according to the Management there\n\nwere no outsourcing agencies, who are being sought after 1989.\n\nSri P L Mathew has spoken that Management of MICO got\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                20</span>\n\n\nregistration certificate under <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_11\">Contract Labour (Regulation &amp;\n\nAbolition) Act</a>, on 25.4.1994. His evidence does not throw light\n\nas to relationship.   He has stated first party workmen were\n\nappointed in Naganathapura Plant since it started functioning\n\nand then voluntarily stated they were appointed through a\n\ncontractor.   In 1989 there were no contractors even according\n\nto Mr.Mathew, as deposed by him, because it was only on\n\n26.5.1994 that they got a registration/license under <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_12\">Contract\n\nLabour (Regulation &amp; Abolition) Act</a> to engage contract labour.\n\nTherefore, evidence of Mr.P L Mathew that from the beginning\n\nthe workmen were engaged on contract labour is a total\n\nfalsehood.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_13\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"28043773\" id=\"span_22\">12.

After hearing the learned senior counsel for the\n\nparties, the point that arises for consideration in this writ petition\n\nis, whether the Labour Court has acted illegally and with material\n\nirregularity   in   passing   the    impugned   award,   calling   for\n\ninterference at the hands of this Court? My answer would be in\n\nthe negative for the following reasons:\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">      14. On the preliminary issues, which were framed at the\n\ninstance of the petitioner, petitioner examined MW-1 Mathew\n\nP.L. and Exs.M1 to M60 were marked. On behalf of the\n\nrespondent WW1 to WW3 were examined and Exs.W1 to\n\nEx.W148 were marked.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">      15. The Labour Court while passing the order dated\n\n4.4.2009 on the preliminary issues referred evidence of WW-1 to\n\nWW-3, which disclosed that there is a separate union called\n\nMICO Karmikara Rakshaka Sangha, Naganathapura and that the\n\npresent workmen are not the members of that Union.             WW-1\n\nadmitted in his cross-examination as to separate Union called\n\nMICO Karmikara Sangha. It is his say that they tried to join as\n\nmembers of that union but the Management opposed. He has\n\nalso stated, filing of suit O S No.242/1997 praying for orders\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                22</span>\n\n\nagainst MICO regarding non-extending agency to Guardwell\n\nDetective Services. It is elicited from him that 45 workmen have\n\nsigned in Ex.W124 and Ex.W125. Similarly 47 workmen have\n\nsigned in Ex.W126 and Ex.W127. WW-1 has also admitted that\n\ntill today they are not the members of MICO Employees Credit\n\nCooperative Society.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_18\">     16. WW-2 G R Shivashankar, who is the President of the\n\nrespondent union has deposed that all the 72 workers are\n\nmembers of the Union.     He has deposed that Naganathapura\n\nPlant was established in the year 1989. The 72 workmen started\n\nto work in the Watch &amp; Ward Department when Naganathapura\n\nplant of MICO was started. However, Watch &amp; Ward workmen of\n\nNaganathapura plant were not extended the service conditions\n\nas they were extended to same workmen of Adugodi plant. As\n\nfar as the respondent workmen are concerned, they themselves\n\nconstitute a separate category of workmen, who are exclusively\n\nemployed in the Watch &amp; Ward Department.        WW-2 has also\n\nadmitted as to the existence of Union called MICO Karmikara\n\nSangha at Naganathapura. He has admitted that permanent\n\nemployees of Naganathapura plant of MICO are not members of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                23</span>\n\n\nthe respondent Union.    Likewise the members of respondent\n\nunion, who are working at Naganathapura plant are not\n\nmembers of MICO Karmikara Sangha, Naganathapura.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">     17. WW-3 Mehaboob Pasha also deposed on similar line as\n\nthat of WW-1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_20\">     18. MW-1 is P L Mathew, Divisional Manager of the\n\npetitioner has deposed that Karnataka Rakshaka &amp; General\n\nWorkers Union does not represent the workmen at MICO, hence\n\nthey cannot raise any dispute on behalf of the contract labourers\n\nnor they are competent to do so.        The said Union is not\n\nrecognized by the petitioner and petitioner never negotiated with\n\nthe said Union and thus it has no locus standi to espouse the\n\ncause of the respondent labourers.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">     19. It is to be mentioned here that Union of the Principal\n\nEmployer has to espouse the cause of the workmen for\n\nmaintaining the dispute under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_14\">Industrial Disputes Act</a>. But on\n\nthe basis that there are 72 workmen in the respondent, it is held\n\nthat their interest amounts to community of interest and they\n\nthemselves can raise an industrial dispute. There is no dispute\n\nthat these 72 workmen have been working in the petitioner since\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                 24</span>\n\n\nits inception.   MW-1 has clearly admitted that the respondent\n\nworkmen joined the petitioner in the year 1989 at the time of\n\nestablishment of Naganathapura Plant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">      20. The Labour Court placed reliance on a decision\n\nreported in 1965(I) LLJ SC Page 668 (Workmen of M S\n\nDharmapal Premchand vs., M/s.Dharmapal Premchand) to the\n\neffect that `All those workmen who were members of the union\n\ndismissed from service, the dispute in regard to their claim for\n\nreinstatement espoused by such union of which none of the\n\nother workmen in service was member, the reference of such\n\ndispute for adjudication, in the circumstances, held valid&#x27;.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"74846490\" id=\"span_27\">21.

Therefore, the Labour Court was justified in holding\n\nthat the workmen are having community of interest as Watch\n\nand Ward employees working under the petitioner since its\n\ninception right from the year 1989.                Though the Karnataka\n\nRakshaka and General Workers Union had no locus standi to\n\nrepresent the workmen, these 72 workmen having community of\n\ninterest have right to espouse their cause as per the definition of\n\nIndustrial Dispute under the <a href=\"/doc/500379/\" id=\"a_17\">I.D Act</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">        23. So far as relationship of employer and employee\n\nbetween the petitioner and the respondent workmen, the Labour\n\nCourt placed reliance on deposition of MW-1. MW-1 has deposed\n\nto the fact of valid registration of labour contract certificate\n\ndated      21.4.1994    and   entering      into   valid     contracts    with\n\nM/s.Terrier    Security    Systems        and   M/s.Guardwell      Detective\n\nServices from time to time. On 25.4.1994 the Assistant Labour\n\nCommissioner approved the list of contractors submitted by the\n\npetitioner.   The     petitioner   also    produced     agreement        dated\n\n25.8.1995 and its extension on 3.1.1997.               On 23.10.1997 the\n\nsecurity    service    contract    was     entrusted    to    M/s.Guardwell\n\nDetective Services and its approval by the Assistant Labour\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_29\">                                 26</span>\n\n\nCommissioner on 5.11.2004. The Company addressed letter to\n\nthe Assistant Labour Commissioner on 4.9.1997 that there was\n\nno abolition of contract labourers in the area of security by the\n\nGovernment.    MW-1 deposed regarding the licence was not\n\nrenewed but claimed deemed renewal. According to MW-1 there\n\nare 65 security guards and head guards in the company\n\nemployed through the contractors.      It is admitted that the\n\nsecurity personnel are only involved in the present case. Only\n\none security agency was engaged at Naganathapura plant at any\n\ngiven point of time.     It is admitted that security personnel\n\nworking at Naganathapura plant have community of interest. In\n\nthe cross-examination dated 24.8.2005, MW-1 has admitted that\n\non 1.4.1989, Naganathapura Plant was started. The respondent\n\nworkmen    were    the   ones   who   were   appointed   in   the\n\nNaganathapura plant since it started functioning.   However, he\n\nvolunteered that respondent workmen were appointed through a\n\ncontractor. No contract agreement is produced by MW-1 of the\n\nyear 1989 to substantiate the contention of the petitioner that\n\nthe respondent workmen were appointed through contractors\n\nthemselves then.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                 27</span><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_27\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_28\">      24. MW-1 has admitted that security department is\n\npermanent department in the establishment and it works round\n\nthe clock in shifts.    The shift schedule is prepared by the\n\nAssistant Security Officer of the security agency under the\n\noverall guidance of the security officer employed by the\n\ncompany.    However, the petitioner did not produce any record\n\nregarding the supervision by the security officer of the security\n\nagency in the year 1989 till the year 1994.      It is elicited that\n\nregarding day to day problems, the Assistant Security Officer\n\ninforms the security officer of the company. MW-1 has admitted\n\nthat Adugodi plant had its own permanent security guards in the\n\nyear 1989 and the respondent workmen carried out the functions\n\nsimilar to the functions of the security guard of Adugodi plant. It\n\nis admitted, the respondent workmen were permitted to avail\n\ncanteen facility in the factory premises where they get food at\n\nsubsidized rates.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_29\">      25. The petitioner recalled MW-1 later who deposed in\n\nchief that in the year 1989 Sainik Welfare &amp; Tree Forming\n\nSociety was providing security services and it continued till\n\n7.7.1992.    From 8.7.1992 the Terrier Security Services is\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                 28</span>\n\n\nproviding the security services.      It is elicited that Ex.M16,\n\nsettlement is not applicable to Naganathapupra unit. From the\n\nevidence of MW-1 it is seen the respondent workmen joined\n\npetitioner in the year 1989.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_30\">      26. Ex.M1 is copy of certificate of registration dated\n\n21.4.1994.     Ex.M2 is telefax message from Guardwell &amp;\n\nDetective Services dated 14.6.1999. Ex.M3 contained name of\n\nthe contract labourers approved by the Labour Commissioner.\n\nEx.M4 is list of contractors. However, these documents did not\n\nestablish the fact of contract labour as in the year 1989 till 1992.\n\nEx.M5 is also amended certificate of registration of the year\n\n1994. Ex.M7 service contract dated 25.8.1995 with Peoples&#x27;\n\nChoice. Ex.M8 dated 3.1.1997. Ex.M9 dated 14.6.1999. Ex.M10\n\ndated October, 1997.       Therefore, these documents do not\n\npertain to the year when the dispute is raised by the workmen.\n\nSo also Ex.M13 is subsequent to the period of raising the dispute\n\nbeing regularization of contract labourers. Therefore, the Labour\n\nCourt concluded that on the basis of these materials, it is not\n\npossible to conclude that the workmen were the contract\n\nlabourers as on the data of raising the dispute.\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_32\">                                  29</span>\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_31\">      27. WW-1 has deposed in his evidence that various\n\nmechanisms were adopted by the petitioner to make it appear\n\nthat they were not the workmen of the MICO. It is only a paper\n\nwork done by the management. All the entries in the attendance\n\nregister are made by the officers and supervisors of the\n\nmanagement of MICO at Naganathapura Plant. The wages were\n\ncalculated on the basis of the certificates issued by the officers of\n\nthe MICO at Naganathapura plant.           The names of all the\n\nworkmen are mentioned in the duty roster.         The management\n\nwas also maintaining MICO Security Personnel Muster Roll\n\npertaining to Naganathapura Plant. They are doing the work on\n\npar with the permanent employees of Watch &amp; Ward Department\n\nat Adugodi plant of MICO. The so called contractors are only\n\nname lenders.     It is his evidence that Terrier Security Systems\n\nor M/s.Guardwell or M/s.Unique had no licence and only\n\nsubsequently licnences were taken with a view to make it appear\n\nthat MICO had outsourced the work in the Watch and Ward\n\nDepartment. The petitioner did not dispute the original registers\n\nmaintained by them at Ex.W1 to W7 where name of the\n\nworkmen appeared there. Ex.W1 bears the name of the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                30</span>\n\n\npetitioner with its emblem. Ex.W2 also contained the names of\n\nworkmen for the month of November 1993 to December, 1993.\n\nEx.W3 for the months of January 1994 to March, 1994 wherein\n\nalso names of the respondent workmen appeared with signature\n\nof persons who prepared it. So also Ex.W4, W5, W.6 and W7,\n\nattendance registers for different periods containing the names\n\nof respondent workmen with initials of MW-1 P L Mathew. WW-1\n\ndeposed to the production of certificates at Ex.W8 to W15. It is\n\nevident that by virtue of fire services training undergone by the\n\nrespondent workmen, the address of the respondent workmen\n\nmentioned as MICO, Naganathapura, Bangalore.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">     28. The duty rosters Ex.W20 to W24 dated 25.3.1996,\n\n17.4.1996, 20.4.1996, 15.4.1996 and 6.7.1996 indicated name\n\nof respondent workmen and bearing the signature of MW-1 P L\n\nMathew. Ex.W30 is the instructions by the petitioner in respect\n\nof left out barrels for melting. Ex.W31 is copy of cash voucher\n\nfor payment to D Venkatesh. Ex.W32 to W48 movement records\n\nof the security guards and loading slips at Ex.W49 to Ex.W68\n\nbearing the emblem of the petitioner.    WW-1 has denied that\n\nthere were only contract security guards in their establishment\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                 31</span>\n\n\nright from the year 1989.      It is also denied that M/s.Terrier\n\nSecurity Services took out the agency in deployment of security\n\nguards. It is elicited that his name finds place in the statement\n\nof Provident Fund submitted by the Guardwell Detectives. It is\n\nelicited that they have submitted before the court through their\n\nadvocate that they are willing to serve with Unique Detective\n\nSecurity Services Pvt. Ltd., but according to them, they agreed\n\nso, keeping open all the issues referred. It is stated that order\n\ndated 11.3.2005 was passed for the purpose of convenience of\n\nboth the parties and therefore it is not possible to hold that the\n\nrespondent workmen were the contract workers and that there is\n\nno relationship in between the parties.    As to deduction of PF\n\nand ESI contributions, WW1 explained that deduction by the\n\nsecurity agency was not shown to them. It is elicited that there\n\nare no documentary evidence to show that it is the MICO which\n\nprepared the list of security personnel.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_33\">      29. The Labour Court declined to refer Ex.M22 a Xerox\n\ncopy of the affidavit said to have been filed in O S No.242/1997\n\nbefore Anekal Court on the ground that it did not indicate the\n\noriginal number of the civil suit, did not indicate signature of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">                                 32</span>\n\n\ndefendant and signature of the advocate and did not bear date\n\nalso.

The petitioner\n\ncontended that the workmen contended there as contract\n\nworkers and therefore their grievance cannot be entertained.\n\nThe Labour Court held that on the basis of Ex.M23 the\n\ncontentions raised in the dispute cannot be brushed aside since\n\nit related to the year 1997 and the dispute related to the\n\nrelationship existed from 1989 to 1996.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_34\">      30.

He does not\n\nknow whether there are many contract agencies in Bangalore\n\nwhich are looking after the security business. It is also elicited\n\nthat there is a signature of P L Mathew in Ex.W3.

It is elicited that Ex.M18 register\n\nmaintained        by   Unique   Detective   indicates   his     name       and\n\nsignature at Ex.M18(a).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_35\">     31. It is elicited from WW-1 that there is a separate\n\ncanteen holding for contract labourers. It is admitted that they\n\nare receiving breakfast everyday. But he has not admitted that\n\nthese items were supplied in the canteen at free of cost. It is\n\nelicited that they had raised a dispute before the conciliation\n\nofficer that they are contract workers.             WW1 has given an\n\nexplanation that such words were written by them. The Labour\n\nCourt concluded that on the basis of this piece of evidence, it\n\ncannot be said that the dispute now raised by the respondent\n\nworkmen      is    not   maintainable    and   as   such      there   is    no\n\nrelationship. This aspect has to be decided on going through the\n\nentire evidence on record, oral or documentary. It is elicited,\n\nMICO had not given the orders of punishment to the workmen. It\n\nis explained that duty rosters contained 29 sheets at Ex.W70.\n\nThe duty roster maintained by the MICO showed name of the\n\nworkmen worked under their hands whose positive photos of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_37\">                                  34</span>\n\n\nBiju K.S. are at Ex.W71 and Ex.W72.          He deposed that\n\nprescribed uniform could be found in those photos along with\n\ncap emblem and belt emblem which showed the emblem of\n\nMICO.    The petitioner did not explain as to how duty rosters\n\ncame into existence in favour of the respondent workmen.      If\n\nthe respondent workmen were working under contract agency,\n\nthere was no need for the petitioner to maintain such duty\n\nrosters at a particular point of time.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_36\">      32. Ex.W71 photo refers to one Biju K.S.      This is not\n\ndiscredited in the cross-examination of WW-1. Those photos did\n\nbear the emblem of the petitioner in the cap and belt. This is\n\nalso not discredited by the petitioner in the cross of WW-1. The\n\noral evidence of WW-1 coupled with these duty rosters and\n\nphotos made the evidence of WW-1 more probable than the\n\nevidence of MW-1.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">      33. Thus the oral evidence of WW-1, WW-3 coupled with\n\nadmission of MW-1 in his cross-examination made it manifest\n\nthat respondent workmen joined the petitioner for service in the\n\nyear 1989.    No doubt the petitioner placed some records to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_38\">                                  35</span>\n\n\ncontend that the contractors had employed these respondent\n\nworkmen and as such there is no any such relation.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">       34. The registration certificate of the petitioner was of the\n\nyear 1995. The fact is that the respondent workmen have been\n\nworking from 1989 to 1995, which is not in dispute. There is no\n\nacceptable answer from the petitioner that under whom the\n\nrespondent workmen worked as Watch and Ward from the year\n\n1989 to 1994. The workmen have placed attendance registers\n\nmaintained by the management which are not disputed. Hence\n\nthere was no impediment to place reliance on those attendance\n\nregisters, duty rosters. There was no occasion for the petitioner\n\nto maintain attendance registers in the year 1993. Those\n\nregisters were not maintained by any labour contractors.            The\n\ncontractors claimed by the petitioner related to the year 1994\n\nand onwards.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_39\">       35. No doubt it is established that no appointment orders\n\nwere issued to the respondent workmen by the petitioner. But it\n\nis not disputed that these workmen joined the service in the year\n\n1989    itself.   The   petitioner    has   also   not   produced   any\n\nappointment orders given by the contractors to the respondent\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                      36</span>\n\n\nworkmen of the year 1989 to 1994. There is no explanation by\n\nthe petitioner whether their licence was renewed. There is also\n\nno material that the respondent workmen surrendered their\n\nrights    and   thereafter    they   joined   as    a   workmen      under\n\ncontractors.    The petitioner has not pleaded and proved as to\n\nhow the workmen became the contract labourers under the\n\nsubsequent contractors.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_40\">         36. Thus looking to the entire facts and circumstances of\n\nthe case, the Labour Court opined that there is relationship of\n\nmaster and servant in between the petitioner and respondent\n\nworkmen. Further in view of this finding as to relationship, it is\n\nopined by the Labour Court that the issue relating to contract\n\nlabour and abolition of contract labour assumed no importance\n\nand it did not survive for consideration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">         37. No doubt this order dated 4.4.2009 passed by the\n\nLabour      Court   was   assailed    by   the     petitioner   in   W   P\n\nNo.27075/2009 (L).           This court permitted the petitioner to\n\nwithdraw the writ petition by the order dated 14.9.2009 with\n\nliberty to challenge the order if the final award goes against the\n\nmanagement. The order of reference was as to whether the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                   37</span>\n\n\ncontention of the Management that the workmen were workmen\n\nof the contractor and whether such a contention was a sham or\n\nwhether the workmen are the employees of the petitioner\n\nManagement.           The   order      dated   4.4.2009   conclusively\n\nestablished that the workmen are the direct employees of\n\nBOSCH management and that there is relationship of master and\n\nservant. The evidence led by the Management after the findings\n\nrecorded on the preliminary issues dated 4.4.2009 cannot be of\n\nany help to the petitioner. The order dated 4.4.2009 passed by\n\nthe Labour Court was not either set aside or the Labour Court\n\ncould have gone beyond the findings recorded in the said order\n\nby considering the further evidence adduced by the petitioner.\n\nThe same 72 workmen alone worked as Security Guards,\n\nAssistant Security Guards and Head Guards, probablised that the\n\npetitioner&#x27;s plea that it outsourced the functioning of the Watch\n\n&amp; Ward by actually entrusting the same to the licensed\n\ncontractors is difficult to accept.    The petitioner having invited a\n\nfinding regarding the relationship, it was not open for them to\n\ncontend that their contention that their relationship with the\n\ncontractors was not sham.         The petitioner was satisfied by\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                 38</span>\n\n\ntendering evidence of MW-1 alone. The further evidence which\n\nwas adduced of the contractors and so many documents to\n\nestablish that the respondent workmen were the employees of\n\nthe contractors was an afterthought attempt by the petitioner,\n\nwhich could have been as well produced at the time of trial on\n\nthe preliminary issues. In 1989, there was no contractor as is\n\ndeposed by MW-1 and it was only on 26.5.1994 they got a\n\nregistration under the <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_18\">Contract Labour (Regulation &amp; Abolition)\n\nAct</a>.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">       38. Therefore, the Labour Court was justified in observing\n\nthat in view of non existence of any labour contract itself in\n\nfavour of anyone of their labour contractors, the respondent\n\nworkmen having continued to render the services as watch and\n\nward of the petitioner become the workmen under the second\n\nparty and the petitioner in turn will be the principal employer of\n\nthe respondent workmen. The findings on the preliminary issues\n\nvide order dated 4.4.2009 became final so far as the Labour\n\nCourt was concerned.       The Labour Court could not again\n\nadjudicate and give finding on those issues.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                  39</span><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_43\">\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">      39. Once the petitioner failed to establish that appointment\n\nof the workmen in 1989 was through the contractors only, that\n\nstatus cannot be changed even if it is subsequently established\n\nthat the workmen continued with the contractors unless it is\n\nfurther established that the workmen surrendered their rights.\n\nIn that view of the matter, the respondent workmen were\n\nentitled for the relief of regularization and payment of arrears.\n\nTherefore, I am of the view that the award passed by the Labour\n\nCourt does not suffer from any irregularity or illegality calling for\n\ninterference by this Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_45\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neg\" data-docid=\"366376\" id=\"span_43\">40. The learned senior counsel for the petitioner placed\n\nreliance on a decision in <a href=\"/doc/366376/\" id=\"a_19\">Gujarat Electricity Board Vs., Hind\n\nMazdoor    Sabha</a>    (1995(II)   LLJ   790    and   contended    that\n\ncommunity of interest means the workmen of principal employer\n\nwho are interested in absorption of contract labour should\n\nespouse their case and that if a contractor for any particular\n\nperiod of time did not have a licence that does not confer a\n\npermanent employee status to contract labour with the principal\n\nemployer . On the face of the view taken as above that there\n\nexisted relationship of employer and employee between the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">                                   40</span>\n\n\npetitioner and respondent workmen for more than one reason,\n\nthis decision is of no help to the petitioner.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_46\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1160961\" id=\"span_45\">41. Further the learned senior counsel placed reliance on\n\na decision in <a href=\"/doc/1160961/\" id=\"a_20\">Steel Authority of India Ltd., vs., Union of India &amp;\n\nothers</a>, reported in 2006(4) L.L.N.651 and contended that entire\n\nsalary/wages social benefits like P.F. ESI, bonus etc., as\n\nprotected were paid by the contractor and therefore the\n\nrespondent workmen cannot be deemed to be the employees of\n\nthe principal employer. But the evidence in the case is otherwise\n\nand on the basis of the material, it is observed as above that\n\nsuch social benefits are deducted by the petitioner from out of\n\nthe salary of the respondent workmen and therefore this\n\ndecision is also of no help to the petitioner.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_47\">      <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"179897167\" id=\"span_46\">42.

That would obviously amount to an\n        unfair labour practice which may not strictly be\n        punishable     but    which   would   as   well    not   be\n        countenanced     in    adjudication   of   an     industrial\n        dispute.     As observed earlier, the adjudicator of\n        industrial disputes is also guided by the spirit of\n        constitutional edicts and cannot allow an employer\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                  42</span>\n\n\n     to take benefit of the own wrong in employing for a\n     fairly long period, a set of its workforce as contract\n     labourers, bypassing its own recruitment rules and\n     procedure    for   selection,    resulting   into   obvious\n     discrimination and an unjust inequality.\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">      44. Therefore, it is clear, the Management has resorted to\n\nvarious strategies of making direct employees as contract\n\nemployees, which is unacceptable in law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">      45. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1513693\" id=\"span_50\">In <a href=\"/doc/1513693/\" id=\"a_23\">L.I.C. of India v.

The State is obliged to provide to workmen\n\nfacilities to reach minimum standard of health, economic security\n\nand civilized living. The principle <a href=\"/doc/1513693/\" id=\"a_24\">laid down by</a> this law requires\n\ncourts to ensure that a workman who has not been found guilty\n\ncannot be deprived of what he is entitled to get.
