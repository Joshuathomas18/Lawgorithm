Thus,       this         is     the      jurisdictional\n         fact which goes to the root of the matter and\n         therefore it was incumbent on the Tribunal to\n         decide the same in order to decide the Reference\n         on merits against the petitioner Company.\n</p>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_16\">         3.4.

At       this        stage,           it          is\n         pointed out that in the said report, it was only\n         requested           to     the     Commissioner                   of       Labour              to\n         initiate appropriate proceedings for deciding the\n         dispute since the said authority is having the\n         jurisdiction to decide the same as per condition\n         No.5 of license. Thus, the said report could not\n         have been treated as binding and conclusive proof\n         of the fact that the nature of work performed by\n         the Contractor&#x27;s workmen were same as performed\n         by the petitioner&#x27;s workmen.

The         third\n         contention            of        the      petitioners                  is        that         the\n         Tribunal           has         not       considered                 the         financial\n         capacity of the employer while giving direction\n         to pay the same wages as is being paid to the\n         workmen of the Company. The Tribunal ought to\n         have      considered             the         paying           capacity              of       the\n         Contractor.\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_16\">         9.

If there is any\n               dispute with regard to the type of work, the\n               dispute has to be decided by the Chief Labour\n               Commissioner (Central). It is clear that\n               Parliament has not abolished contract labour\n               as such but has provided for its abolition by\n               the Central Government in appropriate cases\n               under   <a href=\"/doc/1669932/\" id=\"a_23\">sec.  10</a>   of  the   contract  <a href=\"/doc/1810788/\" id=\"a_24\">Labour\n               (Regulation and Abolition) Act, 1970</a>.

The Labour Court could not\n         have gone into the question whether the\n         contract was sham or not because no such\n         reference was made to the Labour Court.\n         The reference made to the Labour Court\n         was that whether the services of the\n         petitioner were illegally terminated or\n         not and the contention of the petitioner\n         was that he was a direct employee of the\n         respondent.     I    consider      that    the\n         petitioner should have initially raised a\n         proper dispute.

This Court,\n         in Hindustan Antibiotics Ltd. v.The Workmen,\n         1967-1 SCR 652 = (AIR 1967 SC 948) recognised\n         the three concepts of minimum wage, fair\n         wage,   and  living   wage   by  quoting  the\n         following passage from the decision in\n         Hindustan Times Ltd.New Delhi v.Their Workmen\n         1964-1 SCR 234 = (AIR1963 SC 1332), and\n         stating that it briefly and neatly defined\n         the three concepts : &quot;In trying to keep true\n         to the two points of social philosophy and\n         economic    necessities    which    vie   for\n         consideration, industrial adjudication has\n         set to itself certain standards in the matter\n         of wage fixation. At the bottom of the\n         ladder, there is the minimum basic wage which\n         the employer of any industrial labour must\n         pay in order to be allowed to continue an\n         industry. Above this is the fair wage, which\n         may roughly be said to approximate to the\n         need based minimum, in the sense of a wage\n         which is &quot;adequate to cover the normal needs\n         of the average employee regarded as a human\n         being in a civilised society&quot;. Above the fair\n         wage is the &quot;living wage&quot;-a wage &#x27;which will\n         maintain the workman in the highest state of\n         industrial efficiency, which will enable him\n         to provide his family with all the material\n         things which are needed for their health and\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_75\">                              Page 32 of 42</span>\n\nHC-NIC                      Page 32 of 42     Created On Wed Apr 26 00:42:35 IST 2017\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_76\">                C/SCA/12098/2016                                              CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n               physical well-being, enough to enable him to\n               qualify   to  discharge  his  duties   as  a\n               citizen.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">               These decisions make it clear that, if the\n               claim be for a minimum wage, the employer\n               must pay that wage in order to be allowed to\n               continue the industry; and, in such a case,\n               the capacity of the industry to pay is\n               irrelevant. However, if the industry is\n               already paying the minimum wage, and the\n               claim is for fair wage or living wage, the\n               capacity of the industry to pay is a very\n               important factor, and the burden above the\n               minimum wage can only be justifiably imposed\n               if the industry is capable of meeting that\n               extra burden. On this principle, in the\n               present case, if the appellants had succeeded\n               in showing that they were not receiving even\n               the minimum wage on the basis of the offer\n               made   by  the   Board  in   line  with   the\n               settlements arrived at with the other Unions-\n               and individual workmen members of the Sangh,\n               there would have been full justification for\n               granting   additional   dearness   allowance,\n               ignoring the inability of the Board to meet\n               that extra expenditure. The finding of the\n               Tribunal, however, is that the demand of the\n               workmen is not confined to minimum wage, but\n               that, as a result of the demand, the wages\n               will be above the minimum wage. Learned\n               counsel appearing for the appellants before\n               us did not try to contend that the wages\n               which were being paid by the Board, were\n               lower than the minimum wage, so that the\n               claim for the additional dearness allowance\n               cannot be considered without taking into\n               account the capacity of the Board to meet the\n               expenditure.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_51\">         19.           <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"118501220\" id=\"span_77\">In     the   case     of        <a href=\"/doc/118501220/\" id=\"a_42\">P.Gunasekaran</a>                 (supra),\n         the    Hon&#x27;ble           Supreme       Court           has         observed                 in\n         paragraph 15 as under:</span>\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_78\">                                           Page 33 of 42</span>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">HC-NIC                                 Page 33 of 42       Created On Wed Apr 26 00:42:35 IST 2017\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_79\">          C/SCA/12098/2016                                       CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n\n         &quot;15.

The scope of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 226</a> in dealing with\n         departmental inquiries has come up before\n         this Court. Two propositions were <a href=\"/doc/118501220/\" id=\"a_44\">laid down\n         by</a> this Court in State of A.P.v.S.Sree Rama\n         Rao. First, there is no warrant for the view\n         that in considering whether a public officer\n         is guilty of misconduct charged against him,\n         the rule followed in criminal trials that an\n         offence is not established unless proved by\n         evidence beyond reasonable doubt to the\n         satisfaction of the Court must be applied. If\n         that rule be not applied by a domestic\n         tribunal of inquiry the High Court in a\n         petition    under   <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_45\">Article    226</a>    of    the\n         Constitution is not competent to declare the\n         order    of   the   authorities    holding    a\n         departmental enquiry invalid. The High Court\n         is not a court of appeal under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 226</a>\n         over the decision of the authorities holding\n         a departmental enquiry against a public\n         servant. The Court is concerned to determine\n         whether the enquiry is held by an authority\n         competent in that behalf and according to the\n         procedure prescribed in that behalf, and\n         whether the rules of natural justice are not\n         violated.   Second,   where  there    is   some\n         evidence which the authority entrusted with\n         the duty to hold the enquiry has accepted and\n         which evidence may reasonably support the\n         conclusion that the delinquent officer is\n         guilty of the charge, it is not the function\n         of the High Court to review the evidence and\n         to arrive at an independent finding on the\n         evidence. The High Court may interfere where\n         the departmental authorities have held the\n         proceedings against the delinquent in a\n         manner inconsistent with the rules of natural\n         justice or in violation of the statutory\n         rules prescribing the mode of enquiry or\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_81\">                              Page 34 of 42</span>\n\nHC-NIC                      Page 34 of 42     Created On Wed Apr 26 00:42:35 IST 2017\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">          C/SCA/12098/2016                                       CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n         where    the   authorities    have    disabled\n         themselves from reaching a fair decision by\n         some   considerations   extraneous    to   the\n         evidence and the merits of the case or by\n         allowing themselves to be influenced by\n         irrelevant   considerations   or   where   the\n         conclusion on the very face of it is so\n         wholly arbitrary and capricious that no\n         reasonable person could ever have arrived at\n         that conclusion. The departmental authorities\n         are, if the enquiry is otherwise properly\n         held, the sole judges of facts and if there\n         is some legal evidence on which their\n         findings can be based, the adequacy or\n         reliability of that evidence is not a matter\n         which can be permitted to be canvassed before\n         the High Court in a proceeding for a writ\n         under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 226.</a></span>\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">         22.

The General Manager did not agree\n         with the Enquiry Committee on that point. The\n         General Manager accepted the evidence. This\n         Court said that it was open to the General\n         Manager to do so and he was not bound by the\n         conclusion reached by the committee.

The findings of fact\n         reached by an inferior court or tribunal as a\n         result of the appreciation of evidence are\n         not   reopened   or    questioned   in   writ\n         proceedings. An error of law which is\n         apparent on the face of the record can be\n         corrected by a writ, but not an error of\n         fact, however grave it may appear to be. In\n         regard to a finding of fact recorded by a\n         tribunal, a writ can be issued if it is shown\n         that in recording the said finding, the\n         tribunal had erroneously refused to admit\n         admissible and material evidence, or had\n         erroneously admitted inadmissible evidence\n         which has influenced the impugned finding.\n         Again if a finding of fact is based on no\n         evidence, that would be regarded as an error\n         of law which can be corrected by a writ of\n         certiorari. A finding of fact recorded by the\n         Tribunal cannot be challenged on the ground\n         that the relevant and material evidence\n         adduced before the Tribunal is insufficient\n         or inadequate to sustain a finding. The\n         adequacy or sufficiency of evidence led on a\n         point and the inference of fact to be drawn\n         from   the  said   finding  are   within  the\n         exclusive jurisdiction of the Tribunal.(See\n         <a href=\"/doc/484719/\" id=\"a_49\">Syed Yakoob v.

The next issue which is required to be\n         decided in the present petitions is that whether\n         the Tribunal has gone beyond the terms of the\n         reference or not? For considering the said issue,\n         once      again,          it   is     required              to      refer          to      the\n         schedule            referred            by          the          Deputy              Labour\n         Commissioner to the Tribunal. From the terms of\n         the reference, it is revealed that the dispute as\n         to whether the contract entered into between the\n         principal Employer and the Contractor is sham and\n         bogus is not at all referred to the Tribunal. In\n         spite of that, while considering the evidence and\n         while giving the finding, the Tribunal has held\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_92\">                                               Page 39 of 42</span>\n\nHC-NIC                                       Page 39 of 42     Created On Wed Apr 26 00:42:35 IST 2017\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_93\">                 C/SCA/12098/2016                                                   CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n         that when the contract is sham and bogus, the\n         Tribunal           has          jurisdiction                to       entertain               the\n         dispute. It is further held by the Tribunal that\n         the GLO has given the deposition vide Exh.115\n         that during his visit, it was revealed that the\n         pumpmen of the contractor and the pumpmen of the\n         Company are performing the same type of work. On\n         the basis of the said evidence, it is held by the\n         Tribunal that in spite of similar type of work\n         being performed by both the set of employees,\n         less     wages            are    paid       to        the     employees              of      the\n         Contractor and therefore the contract is sham and\n         bogus. Thus, we are of the view that the Tribunal\n         has travelled beyond the scope of reference which\n         is not permissible as held by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n         Court, the learned Single Judge of this Court as\n         well as the Division Bench of High Court of Delhi\n         relied upon by learned counsel Mr.Patel for the\n         Company.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_57\">         <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"844022\" id=\"span_94\">25.            From the record, it is further revealed\n         that the Tribunal has also not considered the\n         paying       capacity            of    the        Contractor               to      pay       the\n         wages similar to the wages paid by the Company to\n         its workmen. As held by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court\n         in the case of <a href=\"/doc/844022/\" id=\"a_52\">Workmen of the Gujarat Electricity\n         Board,       Baroda</a>         (supra),            if      the      claim          be     for        a\n         minimum wage, the employer must pay that wage in\n         order to be allowed to continue the industry, and\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_95\">                                                 Page 40 of 42</span>\n\nHC-NIC                                         Page 40 of 42     Created On Wed Apr 26 00:42:35 IST 2017\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                C/SCA/12098/2016                                                 CAV JUDGMENT</span>\n\n\n\n         in such a case, the capacity of the industry to\n         pay is irrelevant. However, if the industry is\n         already paying the minimum wage, and the claim is\n         for fair wage or living wage, the capacity of the\n         industry to pay is a very important factor and\n         the burden above the minimum wage can only be\n         justifiably imposed if the industry if capable of\n         meeting that extra burden. In the present case,\n         there is no finding recorded by the Tribunal that\n         the Contractor is having the paying capacity to\n         pay the wages equivalent to the wages paid to the\n         workmen of the Company.
