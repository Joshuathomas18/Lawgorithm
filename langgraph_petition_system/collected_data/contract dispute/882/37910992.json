Disputes and differences have arisen between the parties\nwhich   admittedly       fall   within      the   ambit      of    the     arbitration\nagreement.     It   is    not   necessary,        for   the       purpose    of   this\napplication, to refer to the same.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_6\">             In the course of the correspondence, the petitioner\nraised certain demands which the respondent rejected. By a letter\ndated 01.07.2016, the petitioner, inter alia, referred to the\ncontract, the fact that the disputes had arisen between the parties\nand invoked the arbitration agreement by requesting the respondent\nto appoint a sole Arbitrator. Mr. Bhan, the learned senior counsel\nappearing on behalf of the petitioner, relied upon paragraphs 7, 8\nand 9 of the letter in which the petitioner expressly invited the\nrespondent&#x27;s attention to the provisions of the Act and in\nparticular <a href=\"/doc/1983758/\" id=\"a_7\">sections 12(3)</a> and (5) and the fifth and seventh\nSchedules thereto.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_7\">5.

Admittedly,    the    learned\nArbitrator was the Chief Secretary of the State of Haryana from\n31.08.2007 to 29.02.2008. It is during this period that the parties\nentered into the contract dated 30.08.2007. Mr. Markanda, the\nlearned counsel appearing on behalf of the respondent, however,\npointed   out     that     the    Ex-Chief        Secretary    was    appointed      on\n31.08.2007, whereas, the work had been awarded in favour of the\npetitioner seven months prior thereto on 29.01.2007. The formal\ncontract was signed on 30.10.2007.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_11\">7.

Mr. Bhan submitted that <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_19\">section 12(1)(a)</a> is of the\nwidest import. I agree. It is of the widest import in every\nsignificant aspect. Firstly, the nature of the relationship,\nrequiring a disclosure, may be direct or even indirect. Secondly,\nthe ambit is not restricted in time - it may be past or present.\nThirdly, the nature of the relationship or interest of the\narbitrator requiring disclosure is also sufficiently wide. The\nrelationship may be with and the interest may be qua the parties as\nalso qua the subject matter in dispute. Further still, the nature\nof the relationship may be with or the interest may be in a variety\nof circumstances - financial, business, professional or other kind.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">           Also well-founded is Mr. Bhan&#x27;s submission that the\ndisclosure is contemplated not merely where the circumstances\nactually impinge upon the independence or impartiality of the\narbitrator. Further, the disclosure is not dependent upon the\nbelief of the arbitrator himself. The disclosure must be made if\nthe circumstances are &quot;likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as\nto his independence or impartiality&quot;. In other words, Mr. Bhan\nsubmitted that the test is not whether there is actual bias but\nwhether the circumstances in question give rise to a justifiable\napprehension of bias. We would put the test a little differently.\nAccording to us, the test indeed is not whether there is actual\nbias but whether, considering the facts and circumstances, a\nreasonable person is likely to apprehend the possibility of bias.\nWhat circumstances would justify such an apprehension in the mind\nof   a   reasonable     person      would    depend     upon   the   facts     and\n\n\n\n\n                                  8 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                 - 9 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_35\">circumstances of the case. It is neither possible nor desirable to\nattempt an enumeration of such circumstances.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_36\">10.       There is a clear distinction between sub-section (1) and\nsub-section (5) of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_20\">section 12</a>. Sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_21\">section 12</a> deals\nwith the requirement of a person to disclose in writing the\ncircumstances which are likely to give rise to justifiable doubts\nas to the person&#x27;s independence or impartiality as an arbitrator\nand which are likely to affect his ability to devote sufficient\ntime to the arbitration and, in particular, his ability to complete\nthe entire arbitration within a period of 12 months. The mere\nexistence of these conditions, illustrations of which are furnished\nin the Fifth Schedule, does not necessarily result in the\ndisqualification of a person being appointed as an arbitrator. Sub-\nsection (5), on the other hand, stipulates the conditions which\nrender a person ineligible to be appointed as an arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_37\">11.       The facts to be disclosed under sub-section (1) of\n<a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_22\">section 12</a> do not necessarily render a person ineligible to be\nappointed an arbitrator. These facts are only to be disclosed.\nExplanation 1 Provides that the grounds stated in the Fifth\nSchedule are only a guide to determining whether they are to be\ndisclosed or not. The grounds stated in the Fifth Schedule are,\ntherefore, not exhaustive. Sub-section (5), on the other hand,\nrenders a person ineligible to be appointed an arbitrator if his\nrelationship with the parties or counsel or the subject matter of\nthe dispute falls under any of the categories specified in the\nSeventh Schedule. If the facts required to be disclosed under sub-\nsection (1) also fall under any of the categories specified in the\nSeventh Schedule, he would be ineligible to be appointed as an\n\n\n\n\n                                  9 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                 - 10 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_38\">arbitrator. If, however, the facts disclosed under sub-section (1)\ndo not fall under any of the categories specified in the Seventh\nSchedule, he would not be rendered ineligible per se. Whether such\nfacts ought to render him ineligible or not would then depend upon\nthe facts of the case. Some of the categories in the Fifth and the\nSeventh Schedules are the same. In such cases, the person would be\nineligible to be appointed an arbitrator in view of sub-section\n(5). The present case is an illustration where a disclosure was\nbound to be made under sub-section (1) but the circumstances do not\nrender the Ex-Chief Secretary ineligible to be appointed an\narbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_39\">12.       In the present case, a disclosure was required to be\nmade by the arbitrator. The requirement is evident from <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_23\">section\n12(1)(a)</a> for the arbitrator was a former Chief Secretary of the\nState of Haryana. A disclosure would be required under <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_24\">section\n12(1)(a)</a> for that engagement constituted the existence of a direct\npast relationship between the arbitrator and the State of Haryana\nwhich relationship even if not financial, business or professional\nwould fall within the ambit of the category constituted by the\nwords &quot;other kind&quot;. As I will shortly indicate - the disclosure,\nhowever, was not necessary in view of the circumstances mentioned\nin the Fifth Schedule, Item 1. It is necessary for an arbitrator to\ndisclose a relationship past or present as an employee, consultant\nor advisor. In any event, the relationship between the Chief\nSecretary and the State, in which the person was appointed as a\nChief Secretary, falls within the ambit of the words &quot;other kind&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">in <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_25\">section 12(1)</a>. I would not read the words &quot;other kind&quot; ejusdem\ngeneris. It is not necessary to elaborate upon importance of the\nposition of a Chief Secretary for it is far too obvious and\n\n\n\n                                 10 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                 - 11 -\n</blockquote>\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">evident. Suffice it to state that the Chief Secretary of a State is\nthe head of the administrative machinery of the State, has control\nover the administrative offices of the State and is the main link\nbetween the State and the Centre.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">13.       Absent anything else, in the present case, all that the\narbitrator was bound to disclose was that she is a former Chief\nSecretary of the State of Haryana. Further, as I will soon\ndemonstrate, this does not render her ineligible to be appointed an\narbitrator.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_41\">          The arbitrator as well as the State of Haryana have\nexpressly disclosed that the said Smt. Promilla Issar was a former\nChief Secretary of the State of Haryana. This is established by the\norder of the Government of Haryana dated 29.07.2016 appointing Smt.\nPromilla Issar as the arbitrator. The order in terms stated that\nshe was the &quot;Ex-Chief Secretary, Haryana&quot;. A copy of this letter\nwas, admittedly, forwarded to the petitioner and the respondent.\nFurther, the arbitrator, by her communication dated 08.08.2016,\nfixing the first meeting in terms, referred to the said order dated\n29.07.2016. Thus, the State of Haryana and the arbitrator disclosed\nthe arbitrator&#x27;s past relationship with the respondent.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_42\">14.       Mr. Bhan, however, submitted that the arbitrator ought\nto have disclosed whether or not she had any direct or indirect,\npast or present interest in relation to the subject matter in\ndispute. The wording of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_26\">section 12</a> does not support the submission\nto the effect that even if the arbitrator had or has no relation to\nthe subject matter of the dispute he must file a disclosure saying\nso. In other words, <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_27\">section 12</a> does not require a declaration in\nthe negative. It does not require the arbitrator to disclose/state\n\n\n\n\n                                 11 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                 - 12 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">that he or she did not or does not have any relationship with the\nparties or interest in the subject matter of the dispute. It is\nonly if the circumstances referred to in <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_28\">section 12</a> exist that a\ndeclaration is to be made to that effect with the necessary\nparticulars. If such a disclosure is not made, it must be presumed\nthat the arbitrator denies the existence of the circumstances\nspecified in <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_29\">section 12(1)</a> and (5).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">15.       I cannot presume at this stage that the Chief Secretary,\nin fact, had a relationship or an interest in relation to the\nsubject matter of the dispute. Nor has the petitioner produced any\nevidence to indicate that the circumstances, referred to in <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_30\">section\n12</a>, other than the fact that the arbitrator was the Chief Secretary\nof the State of Haryana, exist.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_45\">16.       Thus, even assuming that the disclosure was required to\nbe made by the arbitrator at the time of her proposed appointment,\nthe provisions of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_31\">section 12</a> have been complied with.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_46\">17.       Mr. Bhan then submitted that the Seventh Schedule read\nwith <a href=\"/doc/16912364/\" id=\"a_32\">section 12(5)</a> mandates that no arbitrator shall have any\nprofessional or any other relationship whether past or present with\nthe parties or counsel and that the arbitrator should also not have\nbeen an employee, consultant, advisor or have had any other past or\npresent business relationship with a party. He submitted that the\nwords &quot;business relationship&quot; in items 1 of the Fifth and Seventh\nSchedules must be read in a wide and not a narrow sense. Entry 1 in\nthe Fifth and the Seventh Schedules are identical. Mr. Bhan\nsubmitted that the term &quot;business relationship&quot; in <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_33\">section 12</a> and\nin item 1 of the Schedules must be construed widely and the\nengagement of a party as an employee, consultant or advisor falls\n\n\n\n                                 12 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                             - 13 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_47\">within the meaning of the words &quot;business relationship&quot; in view of\nthe words &quot;any other&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_48\">18.       As I noted earlier, item 1 in the Fifth Schedule is\nidentical to item 1 to the Seventh Schedule. Each of them reads as\nunder:-\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">          &quot;Arbitrator&#x27;s relationship with              the parties or\n          counsel\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">                1.    The arbitrator     is             an employee,\n          consultant, advisor or has any                other past or\n          present business relationship with           a party.\n          ......           .....        .....       ......    ......         ......   .......&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">          The language of entry 1 indicates a clear division. The\nbar in <a href=\"/doc/16912364/\" id=\"a_34\">section 12(5)</a> is to a person who is an employee, consultant\nor advisor. In other words, the bar is against a person who is, at\nthe time of appointment, an employee, consultant or advisor of the\nparty concerned. There is no bar against a former employee,\nconsultant or advisor. The words &quot;or has any other past or present\nbusiness relationship with a party&quot; do not include a former\nemployee, consultant or advisor of the party. I will assume that\nthe word &quot;other&quot; indicates that the engagement of a person as an\nemployee, consultant or advisor constitutes a business relationship\nwithin the meaning of entry 1 with the party concerned. The word\n&quot;other&quot;, however, refers to a relationship other than that of an\nemployee, consultant or advisor. Thus, the bar applies in respect\nof a person who has had a business relation with a party other than\nas an employee, consultant or advisor. Any other construction would\nmilitate against the language of the section. If the intention was\nto bar even former employees, advisors or consultants, item 1 in\nboth the Schedules would have been worded entirely differently. It\nwould not then have been necessary to employ the opening words &quot;The\narbitrator is an employee, consultant, advisor or ..... .....&quot;. The\n\n\n\n\n                                 13 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_13\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                     - 14 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">clause makes a clear distinction between an arbitrator who &quot;is&quot; an\nemployee, consultant or advisor and a person who has had any other\nbusiness relationship past or present with a party. The embargo\nagainst   a past      business relationship           does not refer to a\nrelationship of an employee, consultant or advisor.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_51\">19.          The mere fact that a person was a Chief Secretary or\nheld any other office with the Government, does not disqualify\nhim/her from being appointed as an arbitrator. The contention that\nformer employees are disqualified from being appointed because they\nreceive pension and post-retiral benefits from the Government is\nirrelevant. These benefits are not conferred upon them as a favour.\nThese are benefits that they are entitled to by right by virtue of\ntheir employment/past employment. If they are denied the same\notherwise than in accordance with law, they are entitled to adopt\nproceedings to recover the same. Thus, for instance, if an employee\nreceives a post-retiral benefit conferred subsequently but as a\nmatter of policy to other similarly situated persons, it would make\nno difference. An employer including the Government does not do its\nformer employees any favour by disbursing post-retiral benefits\nwhich they are entitled to in law. If a special favour is extended\nto a particular employee out of the ordinary course, it may be a\ndifferent matter altogether. That would depend upon the facts of\neach case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_52\">             I appreciate that an employer does an employee no favour\neven by paying his salary and other emoluments in respect of a\ncontract of an employment. The Legislature, however, sought to draw\na distinction between a past employee and an employee in service.\nIt is probably for good reason for the obligation to pay the\nretiral dues to a person constitutes an entirely different\n\n\n\n                                 14 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                 - 15 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_53\">relationship between an ex-employee and an employer from an\nexisting relationship of master and servant. The nature of control\nover an employee in service is entirely different from the nature\nof relationship between an employer and a former employee. A former\nemployee&#x27;s retiral dues are specified and crystallized for all time\nto come. If they are altered in the normal course, it would make no\ndifference either. However, the relationship between an employer\nand an employee in service is entirely different. In such a case,\nthe employer has, for instance, a right to terminate the services\nof the employee, to take disciplinary action against him and to\ngrant a promotion. It is probably for these reasons that the\nLegislature did not think it necessary to bar a former employee\nfrom being appointed as an arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_54\">20.       Mr. Bhan submitted that having been a Chief Secretary of\nthe Government of Haryana when the contract was entered into, the\narbitrator may have had a role in acting for and on behalf of the\nGovernment and that this fact by itself renders her appointment\nvoid ab initio, as there are justifiable doubts that connect her\neven to the subject matter of the dispute/contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_55\">21.       I have already indicated the distinction between sub-\nsection (1) and (2) of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_35\">section 12</a> on the one hand and sub-section\n(5) of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_36\">section 12</a> and held that a past employment by itself does\nnot render a person ineligible from being appointed an arbitrator.\nThe mere existence of a doubt justifiable, as it may be, does not\nrender him ineligible either. That is only for the purpose of sub-\nsections (1) and (2) of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_37\">section 12</a> to ascertain further if the\narbitrator also had any connection with the contract in question.</p><pre id=\"pre_4\">\n\n\n\n\n                                 15 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                               - 16 -\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_56\">22.        There is no bar, therefore, to a former employee,\nconsultant or advisor of a party being appointed as an arbitrator\nmerely by virtue of his/her past engagement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_57\">23.        Strictly speaking, it is not even necessary for a\nperson,   who     is   approached        in   connection      with   his    possible\nappointment as an arbitrator, to disclose in writing a past\nemployment or engagement as an employee, consultant or advisor\nunless such employment or engagement is likely to give rise to\njustifiable doubts as to his independence or impartiality. Once it\nis held that a mere past employment or engagement as a consultant\nor advisor does not debar a person from being appointed as an\narbitrator, it would follow that such a relationship is not bound\nto be disclosed unless it is likely to give rise to justifiable\ndoubts as to the person&#x27;s independence or impartiality as an\narbitrator. This is clear by the use of the words &quot;which is likely\nto give rise&quot;. If a past employment or engagement as a consultant\nor adviser is not likely to give rise to justifiable doubts as to\nthe person&#x27;s independence or impartiality as an arbitrator, the\nquestion of a disclosure does not even arise. Take for instance, a\ncase of a person who joined a large company in a junior post many\nyears ago and left in a very short time. After a passage of many\nyears, he may justifiably believe that that employment of his\ncannot possibly give rise to a justifiable doubt as to his\nsuitability as an arbitrator where his erstwhile employer is a\nparty.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_58\">24.        Mr. Bhan further contended that the form of the\ncertificate prescribed in the Sixth Schedule establishes that the\n\n\n\n\n                                  16 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                       - 17 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_59\">issuance of the certificate is a condition precedent to the\nacceptance of an appointment as an arbitrator under <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_38\">section 12(1)</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_60\">              The form prescribed in the Sixth Schedule is in\nconformity with sub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_39\">section 12</a> which requires a\ndisclosure of any circumstances &quot;which is likely to give rise to\njustifiable    doubts&quot;     as    to     the   arbitrator&#x27;s   independence   or\nimpartiality and which are likely to affect his ability to devote\nsufficient time to the arbitration and in particular his ability to\nfinish the entire arbitration within 12 months. The form is also in\nthe affirmative and not in the negative. In other words, if,\naccording to the arbitrator, there are no circumstances which are\nlikely to give rise to justifiable doubts about his independence or\nimpartiality or which are likely to affect his ability to devote\nsufficient time to the arbitration, there is no question of his\nissuing the certificate in terms of the Sixth Schedule. The Sixth\nSchedule does not require a certificate in the negative stating\nthat there are no circumstances which are likely to give rise to\njustifiable doubts about the independence or impartiality of the\narbitrator. It cannot be presumed that in addition to Smt. Promilla\nIssar being an Ex-Chief Secretary of the State of Haryana, there\nwere circumstances which are likely to give rise to justifiable\ndoubts as to her independence or impartiality or as to her ability\nto devote sufficient time to the arbitration and in particular her\nability to finish the entire arbitration within 12 months. If, in\nfact, there are such circumstances and the disclosure has not been\nmade, the petitioner is always at liberty to challenge her\nappointment in accordance with the provisions of the Act.                   The\ncontention, therefore, that the appointment occurs only after the\n\n\n\n\n                                 17 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                             - 18 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_61\">disclosure has been made assumes that there is something to\ndisclose.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_62\">25.          In any event, the submission that the appointment occurs\nonly if no objections are found to such disclosure by the parties\nto the agreement and the appointing authority is not well founded.\nA view to this effect would delay an arbitration indefinitely which\nwould defeat the very purpose of the Act and arbitrations. The\nsubmission,    if    accepted,       would      render   many,     if    not   most\narbitrations, non starters. The validity of an appointment cannot\nbe dependent upon the unilateral act of a party objecting to the\nsame.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_63\">26.          Mr. Bhan then submitted that in any event a disclosure\nmust be made not after the appointment but, to use the words of\nsub-section (1) of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_40\">section 12</a>, &quot;when a person is approached in\nconnection with his possible appointment as an arbitrator&quot;. He\nsubmitted that a disclosure made thereafter renders the appointment\nvoid ab initio. He further submitted that in that event a party is\nnot entitled to exercise a right of nominating an arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_64\">27.          Firstly, as rightly submitted by Mr. Markanda, the\ndisclosure contemplated under <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_41\">section 12(1)</a> is required to be made\nonly to the party nominating the arbitrator. If the arbitration\nagreement requires a person other than the parties thereto to\nappoint the arbitrator, the disclosure under <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_42\">section 12(1)</a> must be\nmade by the arbitrator to such person or authority. If it is the\nparties to the agreement who are to appoint the arbitrator, the\ndisclosure     under     <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_43\">section        12(1)</a>    must        be   to    the    party\nappointing/proposing to appoint him. At this stage, it is not\nnecessary for the disclosure to be made to the other party. The\n\n\n\n                                 18 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_18\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                      - 19 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_65\">disclosure is not thereby without any consequence. The disclosure\nenables the party nominating the arbitrator to decide whether or\nnot he should continue with the nomination or to nominate another\narbitrator if he finds that, in view of the facts disclosed, the\narbitrator would be ineligible to be appointed               in view of the\nprovisions of the Act and, in particular, <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_44\">section 12</a> thereof.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_66\">          Indeed, a disclosure would be necessary to all the\nparties. However, the disclosure to the other parties is necessary\nonly from the time of his appointment as is evident from sub-\nsection (2) of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_45\">section 12</a>. Sub-section (2) provides that the\narbitrator &quot;from the time of his appointment and throughout the\narbitral proceedings, shall, without delay, disclose to the parties\nin writing any circumstances referred to in sub-section (1) unless\nthey have already been informed of them by him&quot;. It is clear,\ntherefore, that the disclosure to the party, meaning thereby all\nthe parties is required only from the time of the appointment of\nthe arbitrator. The mere nomination of a person as an arbitrator\ndoes not lead to or result in his appointment as an arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_67\">28.       The appointment is complete only upon his accepting it.\nIf he is inclined to accept his appointment and circumstances\nstipulated in <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_46\">section 12(1)</a> read with the Fifth Schedule exist, he\nmust make the disclosure as per the format provided in the Sixth\nSchedule. A view to the contrary would render sub-section (2)\notiose. If the disclosure was to be made at the stage contemplated\nin sub-section (1), it would have been unnecessary to enact sub-\nsection (2).\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_68\">29.       Even assuming that a disclosure ought to be made to all\nthe parties at the first instance and even prior to the\nappointment, the failure to do so would not render the appointment\n\n\n\n                                 19 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                 - 20 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_69\">void. So long as the disclosure is made even thereafter, it would\nbe sufficient. A party entitled to nominate an arbitrator cannot be\npenalised for a default of the person he seeks to nominate as an\narbitrator. This view would not prejudice any of the parties in any\nmanner whatsoever. They can always insist upon the disclosure being\nmade prior to the commencement of the arbitration proceedings and\nchallenge the appointment if it is found to be contrary to the\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_47\">section 12</a>. I notice that in paragraph 10(6) of the\nwritten submissions tendered by Mr. Bhan, it is submitted that at\nthe highest it can be said that the appointment of an arbitrator is\neffective only after the disclosure is made under <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_48\">section 12(1)</a> and\nsubject to any challenge thereto.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_70\">30.       In the facts of the present case, it cannot be said that\nthe respondent failed to appoint an arbitrator because the\narbitrator did not make a disclosure. Firstly, as a matter of fact,\nthe disclosure was, as stated earlier, made in the order of\nappointment dated 29.07.2016 and in the arbitrator&#x27;s communication\nto the parties dated 08.08.2016. Secondly, even assuming it was not\nmade, the respondent could not be said to have failed to have acted\nas required under the appointment procedure agreed upon by the\nparties. There must be a failure to act on the part of the party,\nwho is entitled to nominate the arbitrator, either as per the terms\nof the arbitration agreement or under the Act. Where a person,\nproposed to be appointed as an arbitrator, fails to make a\ndisclosure, it cannot be said, without anything more, that the\nparty proposing to appoint him has failed to act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_71\">31.       Mr. Bhan submitted that under <a href=\"/doc/1568410/\" id=\"a_49\">section 11 (8)</a>, even the\nSupreme Court and the High Courts are bound to seek a disclosure in\n\n\n\n\n                                 20 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                 - 21 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_72\">writing from the prospective arbitrator in terms of <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_50\">section 12 (1)</a>\nbefore appointing the arbitrator. An appointment made by the High\nCourt under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_51\">section 11</a> is always subject to the provisions of the\nAct, in particular, <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_52\">sections 11</a> and <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_53\">12</a> thereof. As contended by Mr.\nBhan himself, the appointment becomes effective only upon the\ndisclosure being made and would be subject to a successful\nchallenge to the appointment. It would be an implied term of every\nappointment by the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_54\">section 11</a> that a disclosure is\nto be made. In other words, the appointment made by the High Court\nis subject to and, therefore, becomes effective upon the disclosure\nbeing made and further subject to any challenge to the appointment.\nThis, of course, is provided a disclosure is required to be made.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_73\">32.       In any event, an order passed by the High Court under\n<a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_55\">section 11</a> appointing an arbitrator cannot by any stretch of\nimagination be deemed to be void even if the disclosure ought to\nhave been obtained prior to the passing of the order. In other\nwords, even if the High Court is bound to seek a disclosure in\nwriting before passing an order under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_56\">section 11</a> and does not do\nso, a party can always have the order reviewed in which event the\npetition under <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_57\">section 11</a> would be heard de novo. The parties to\nthe petition cannot, even in such circumstances, be held to have\nforfeited their right to nominate an arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_74\">33.       The reliance upon an order of the Bombay High Court in\nSu-kam Power Systems Limited vs. Viom Infra Networks (Maharashtra)\nLimited, 2016 SCC online Bom 3374, is not well founded. The learned\nJudge of the Bombay High Court indeed sought a disclosure from the\narbitrator he proposed appointing before passing the order. The\nissue as to whether an order without following such a procedure\n\n\n\n\n                                 21 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                          - 22 -\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_75\">would be void was neither raised before the learned Judge nor\ndecided by him.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_76\">34.       There is nothing to indicate that the respondent failed\nto appoint the arbitrator. There is nothing to indicate that the\nappointment is ex-facie bad in law.

The balance between procedural fairness and\n              binding nature of these contracts, appears to\n              have been tilted in favour of the latter by the\n              Supreme Court, and the Commission believes the\n              present position of law is far from\n              satisfactory.    Since   the    principles   of\n              impartiality and independence cannot be\n              discarded at any stage of the proceedings,\n              specifically at the stage of constitution of\n              the arbitral tribunal, it would be incongruous\n              to say that party autonomy can be exercised in\n              complete disregard of these principles - even\n              if the same has been agreed prior to the\n              disputes having arisen between the parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">              There    are   certain   minimum    levels   of\n              independence and impartiality that should be\n              required of the arbitral process regardless of\n              the parties&#x27; apparent agreement. A sensible law\n              cannot, for instance, permit appointment of an\n              arbitrator who is himself a party to the\n              dispute, or who is employed by (or similarly\n              dependent on) one party, even if this is what\n              the parties agreed. The Commission hastens to\n              add that Mr. PK Malhotra, the ex officio member\n              of the Law Commission suggested having an\n              exception for the State, and allow State\n              parties to appoint employee arbitrators. The\n              Commission is of the opinion that, on this\n              issue, there cannot be any distinction between\n              State and non-State parties. The concept of\n              party autonomy cannot be stretched to a point\n              where it negates the very basis of having\n              impartial and independent adjudicators for\n              resolution of disputes. In fact, when the party\n              appointing an adjudicator is the State, the\n              duty to appoint an impartial and independent\n              adjudicator is that much more onerous - and the\n              right to natural justice cannot be said to have\n              been waived only on the basis of a &quot;prior&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_87\">              agreement between the parties at the time of\n\n\n\n\n                                 24 of 27\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">               ::: Downloaded on - 14-11-2016 09:35:23 :::</span>\n ARB-166-2016                                                           - 25 -\n</p>\n\n<pre id=\"pre_5\">                 the contract        and    before    arising   of   the\n                 disputes.\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_88\">          58.

In particular, amendments\n              have been proposed to <a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_78\">sections 11</a>, <a href=\"/doc/750244/\" id=\"a_79\">12</a> and <a href=\"/doc/966297/\" id=\"a_80\">14</a> of\n              the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_89\">          59. The Commission has proposed the requirement of\n              having specific disclosures by the arbitrator,\n              at the stage of his possible appointment,\n              regarding existence of any relationship or\n              interest of any kind which is likely to give\n              rise to justifiable doubts. The Commission has\n              proposed the incorporation of the Fourth\n              Schedule, which has drawn from the Red and\n              Orange lists of the IBA Guidelines on Conflicts\n              of Interest in International Arbitration, and\n              which would be treated as a &quot;guide&quot; to\n              determine whether circumstances exist which\n              give rise to such justifiable doubts.

In the event such an ineligible\n              person is purported to be appointed as an\n              arbitrator, he shall be de jure deemed to be\n              unable to perform his functions, in terms of\n              the proposed explanation to <a href=\"/doc/966297/\" id=\"a_82\">section 14</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_90\">              Therefore, while the disclosure is required\n              with respect to a broader list of categories\n              (as set out in the Fourth Schedule, and as\n              based on the Red and Orange lists of the IBA\n              Guidelines), the ineligibility to be appointed\n              as an arbitrator (and the consequent de jure\n              inability to so act) follows from a smaller and\n              more serious sub-set of situations (as set out\n              in the Fifth Schedule, and as based on the Red\n              list of the IBA Guidelines).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_91\">          60.

I   do        not    find    any\nrecommendations debarring absolutely former employees of a\nparty. Even if the recommendations did so, in view of what I\nhave   already    held,     the    Act       does   not      do    so.    The    Law\nCommission&#x27;s disapproval of the judgments of the Supreme\nCourt would make no difference either.
