MEASURMENTS TO BE TAKEN AT SITE\n                             i. The AT, despite holding that measurements are to be taken\n                             at SITE, as recorded in measurement books, turned a blind\n                             eye to the case setup by the respondent that the so called\n                             payment certificate dated 31-08-2014 is prepared on the\n                             basis of as-built drawings, which in itself was sufficient to\n                             reject the entire claim of the respondent.-para 26(i) to (xiii)-\n                             (page 55- 59) and 26 (xxxiii) at page 68\n                             ii. If measurements were to be based upon actual\n                             measurements at site from time to time, the statement dated\n                             31-08-2014 which admittedly is based upon as-built\n                             drawings and not on actual measurements - is discrepant\n                             and cannot be accepted. AT contradicted itself by giving\n                             finding in para 26 (i)- (xiii) at page 55-59 and para 26\n                             (xxxiii) pg 68.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_19\">                             iii. Specific case of NHAI during arguments was that\n                             measurements are to be taken at site, and on the basis of\n                             work executed from time to time. However, the same was\n                             ignored by the AT.

The core material issue which was to be adjudicated by the\n                             AT was the nature of payment certificate dated 31.08.2014\n                             viz.

Nobody pleaded or argued that the document dated 31-\n                             08-2014 is final statement or not. The claimant argued that it\n                             is a FINAL PAYMENT CERTIFICATE, while NHAI argued\n                             that it is an INTERIM PAYMENT CERTIFICATE and can be\n                             modified.

The AT despite recording a finding that certificate dated\n                             31.08.2014 is not a Final Payment Certificate, the AT\n                             deliberately did not hold that the certificate, therefore, is\n                             nothing but an Interim Payment Certificate instead\n                             formulated a new term i.e., ‗Final Statement&#x27;\n                             iv. The AT ignored that there is no clause in entire contract\n                             which provides for payment of Final Statement, and as per\n                             terms of contract, payment can only be of <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_6\">IPC</a> or FPC\n                             (Clause 60.8), not of any final statement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_23\">                             v.

Specific case set up by NHAI was that the certificate is an\n                             <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_8\">IPC</a>. No finding has been rendered on this material issue by\n                             AT, thereby denying adjudication of material issue.\n                             vii. Since, no one argued or pleaded that 31-08-2014 is/is\n                             not a final statement, therefore, there was no occasion for\n                             parties to have made any submission on this count or for\n                             NHAI to respond to it. In addition, the other material issue\n                             as above was not even gone into by the AT, and payment has\n                             been directed without even looking into the provisions of the\n                             Contract Agreement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_24\">                             viii.

The learned counsel for the appellants have painted\n                                 a lurid picture of anomalies that would arise in case the\n                                 Amendment Act were generally to be made retrospective\n                                 in application. Since we have already held that the\n                                 Amendment Act is only prospective in application, no\n                                 such anomalies can possibly arise. It may also be noted\n                                 that the choosing of <a href=\"/doc/1772105/\" id=\"a_36\">Section 21</a> as being the date on\n                                 which the Amendment Act would apply to arbitral\n                                 proceedings that have been commenced could equally be\n                                 stated to give rise to various anomalies. One such\n                                 anomaly could be that the arbitration agreement itself\n                                 may have been entered into years earlier, and disputes\n                                 between the parties could have arisen many years after\n                                 the said arbitration agreement. The argument on behalf\n                                 of the appellants is that parties are entitled to proceed on\n                                 the basis of the law as it exists on the date on which they\n                                 entered into an agreement to refer disputes to\n                                 arbitration. If this were to be the case, the starting point\n                                 of the application of the Amendment Act being only when\n                                 a notice to arbitrate has been received by the respondent,\n                                 which as has been stated above, could be many years\n                                 after the arbitration agreement has been entered into,\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">                        4</span>\n                             Schedule II\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">                        5</span>\n                             (2018) 6 SCC 287\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_171\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_172\">                        O.M.P.

At this stage, this Court deems it apposite to discuss the role of an\n                        Arbitral Tribunal. An Arbitral Tribunal is constituted with the consent of\n                        both the parties when the arbitration clause is invoked by either of the\n                        parties to an agreement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_94\">                        47.    Upon constitution, the Tribunal conducts the inquiry and\n                        proceedings with the participation of the parties to the dispute. It is\n                        considered that while adjudicating a case, the Tribunal delves into the\n                        Statement of Claim, Statement of Defense presented by and on behalf of\n                        the parties and passes an award after due deliberations on issues in\n                        question. Therefore, as per the settled principle, an unfettered intervention\n                        in the Tribunal&#x27;s functioning would defeat the spirit and purpose of the\n                        Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_95\">                        48.

Therefore, the only question before the Courts\n                        while adjudicating an Arbitral Challenge is whether the conclusion drawn\n                        in the impugned Award is supported by the findings of the Arbitrator.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_224\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_225\">                        O.M.P.

It is trite that a finding can be both: a finding of fact\n                              or a finding of law. It may even be a finding on a mixed\n                              question of law and fact. In the case of a finding on a\n                              legal issue the arbitrator may on facts that are proved or\n                              admitted explore his options and lay bare the process by\n                              which he arrives at any such finding. It is only when the\n                              conclusion is supported by reasons on which it is based\n                              that one can logically describe the process as tantamount\n                              to recording a finding. It is immaterial whether the\n                              reasons given in support of the conclusion are sound or\n                              erroneous. That is because a conclusion supported by\n                              reasons would constitute a &quot;finding&quot; no matter the\n                              conclusion or the reasons in support of the same may\n                              themselves be erroneous on facts or in law. It may then\n                              be an erroneous finding but it would nonetheless be a\n                              finding. What is important is that a finding presupposes\n                              application of mind. Application of mind is best\n                              demonstrated by disclosure of the mind; mind in turn is\n                              best disclosed by recording reasons. That is the soul of\n                              every adjudicatory process which affects the rights of the\n                              parties....&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_103\">                        50.

What then would constitute the ‗fundamental\n                                  policy of Indian law&#x27; is the question. The decision in\n                                  ONGC [(2003) 5 SCC 705 : AIR 2003 SC 2629] does\n                                  not elaborate that aspect. Even so, the expression must,\n                                  in our opinion, include all such fundamental principles\n                                  as providing a basis for administration of justice and\n                                  enforcement of law in this country.

The first and\n                                  foremost is the principle that in every determination\n                                  whether by a court or other authority that affects the\n                                  rights of a citizen or leads to any civil consequences,\n                                  the court or authority concerned is bound to adopt what\n                                  is in legal parlance called a ‗judicial approach&#x27; in the\n                                  matter. The duty to adopt a judicial approach arises\n                                  from the very nature of the power exercised by the court\n                                  or the authority does not have to be separately or\n                                  additionally enjoined upon the fora concerned.

Equally important and indeed fundamental to the\n                                  policy of Indian law is the principle that a court and so\n                                  also a quasi-judicial authority must, while determining\n                                  the rights and obligations of parties before it, do so in\n                                  accordance with the principles of natural justice.\n                                  Besides the celebrated audialterampartem rule one of\n                                  the facets of the principles of natural justice is that the\n                                  court/authority deciding the matter must apply its mind\n                                  to the attendant facts and circumstances while taking a\n                                  view one way or the other. Non-application of mind is a\n                                  defect that is fatal to any adjudication. Application of\n                                  mind is best demonstrated by disclosure of the mind and\n                                  disclosure of mind is best done by recording reasons in\n                                  support of the decision which the court or authority is\n                                  taking. The requirement that an adjudicatory authority\n                                  must apply its mind is, in that view, so deeply embedded\n                                  in our jurisprudence that it can be described as a\n                                  fundamental policy of Indian law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_139\">                                  39.

In light of the foregoing discussions, it is clear that insofar an\n                        international commercial arbitration is concerned, the term public policy\n                        would not mean a mere violation, rather there is a threshold which\n                        mandates the interference in such awards where only in cases of\n                        unfairness and unreasonableness which goes to the root of the matter that\n                        can be termed a violation of the basic principles adopted by the country\n                        by way of various laws.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_151\">                        67.

Since the various items of the work have to be\n                             executed over a period of time and cannot be completed over\n                             a single billing cycle, their valuation and stage payment has\n                             to be finalized as the work proceeds and the payment is\n                             released accordingly, which then becomes &#x27;interim payment\n                             for those items of work.

On the contrary, Sub- Clauses 56.1 of GCC\n                             and 57.1 of COPA specifically state that the value of the\n                             works shall be ascertained and determined by measurement.\n                             xii.

The Respondent in Para 70 of its amended SOD (taken\n                             on record through application dated 20.03.2019), has stated\n                             that in view of pendency of disputes between the Parties, no\n                             Final Payment Certificate under Sub- Clause 60.13 could be\n                             issued. The Engineer could have only issued an interim\n                             payment certificate in respect of those parts of a final\n                             statement which are not in dispute. Only after settlement of\n                             disputes in accordance with clause 67, the Final Payment\n                             Certificate could have been issued. This is further fortified\n                             from a reading of clause 60.13, which categorically states\n                             that the Final Payment Certificate shall only be issued on\n                             receipt of final statement and the written discharge. The\n                             Contractor has admittedly not given written discharge-till\n                             date, and no written discharge was available with the\n                             Engineer or submitted to the Engineer by the Claimant as on\n                             August 31, 2014. Therefore, the payment certificate dated\n                             August 31, 2014 should only be treated as an interim\n                             payment certificate, and not final payment certificate.\n                              xxvii. At the same time, the Respondent vide Para 41 of its\n                             amended SOD (RD- 2) has stated that the Engineer after\n                             verification from <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_145\">IPC</a>s, RFIs, MBS etc. corrected the final\n                             bill date 31.08.2014 and submitted revised final bill on\n                             13.07.2017 and further revised Payment Certificate\n                             submitted on 31.12.2017. Yet again, in Para 60 of the same\n                             amended SOD, the Respondent has referred to the Final\n                             Payment Certificate dated 31.12.2017. However, the\n                             Respondent has not clarified how the Revised Final Payment\n                             Certificate issued by the Engineer without the Written\n                             Discharge from the Claimant or without the Claims of the\n                             Claimant pending resolution under Clause 67 of COPA\n                             could be valid when the Final Payment Certificate dated\n                             31.08.2014 was considered to be invalid for the same\n                             reasons.

Further, the Respondent has in Para 27 of its\n                             amended SOD (RD-2) stated that it is the duty of the\n                             Respondent to check whether the Engineer has strictly\n                             scrutinized the final Statement in the light of contractual\n                             provisions and Good Industry Practices before releasing\n                             final payment to avoid loss to the Public Exchequer. There is\n                             no doubt that the Respondent has to ensure that there is no\n                             loss to Public Exchequer but the same has to be ensured by\n                             adhering to the provisions of the Contract. It is felt that the\n                             Respondent through thorough due diligence during the\n                             execution of the Contract could have ensured that there was\n                             no alleged over-payment. Sub-Clause 60.9 appears to have\n                             been included just to take care of such eventualities. Further,\n                             Clause 2.6 of GCC provides another opportunity to the\n                             Parties to have any decision, opinion, consent, expression of\n                             satisfaction, or approval, determination of value or action\n                             opened up, reviewed or revised.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_176\">                              xxix.

As\n                             admittedly, the Respondent filed its Counterclaim\n                             challenging the said Counterclaim only on 08.12.2017, the\n                             said Counter-Claim was filed much beyond the limitation\n                             period of 3 years and is therefore, barred by law from being\n                             entertained.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_213\">                             xxxv.

In the said Para 41, the Respondent\n                                states that *Accordingly, Engineer after verification\n                                from <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_166\">IPC</a>s, RFIs, MBS etc. corrected final bill dated\n                                31.08.2014 and submitted revised final bill on\n                                13.07.2017 and in Para 42, it states that on account\n                                of various corrections required to be carried out in\n                                the final bill dated 31.08.2014.

The third main contention of the Respondent with regards\n                             to the period of limitation is that this period commenced only\n                             on 13.07.2017 Le., on the discovery of a mistake by the\n                             Claimant. The Respondent has averred that unless and until\n                             the observations made by the NHA! were taken into account\n                             by the Engineer and accounted for by assigning a value,\n                             either increase or decrease, and also the exact amount of\n                             difference, it was not possible for NHAI to file Counterclaim.\n                             <a href=\"/doc/160097754/\" id=\"a_167\">Section 17(1)(c)</a> provides that in case of suit for relief on the\n                             ground of mistake, the period of limitation does not begin to\n                             run until plaintiff had discovered it. The mistake in respect of\n                             amounts claimed under the Counterclaim were only\n                             discovered when a negative payment was certified by the\n                             Engineer for the first time on 13.07.2017 and thereafter on\n                             31.12.2017. Therefore, the period of limitation commenced\n                             from 13.07.2017 i.e., the date on which the Respondent\n                             discovered the mistake of the Engineer w.r.t the Final\n                             Payment Certificate dated 31.08.2014 issued by the\n                             Engineer. In view thereof, the present case is, squarely\n                             covered by <a href=\"/doc/1968689/\" id=\"a_168\">Section 17</a> of the Limitation Act and so the\n                             starting point of limitation should be the date when the\n                             mistake is discovered and in the present case the mistake\n                             was discovered only when the Engineer issued revised final\n                             bill dated 13.07.2017. Therefore, the date of discovery of\n                             mistake is 13.07.2017 and not prior to it. Accordingly, the\n                             present Counterclaims by NHAI are well within the period of\n                             limitation.\n</p>\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_595\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_596\">                        O.M.P.

In any case, on\n                             15.10.2014, the Respondent was in a position to easily\n                             ascertain the alleged mistake, if any, in the Final Payment\n                             Certificate dated 31.08.2014. It therefore, cannot be said\n                             that the discovery of said discrepancies came to\n                             Respondent&#x27;s knowledge only when Revised Final Bills were\n                             issued by the Engineer on 13.07.2017 and 31.12.2017 and\n                             that in terms of <a href=\"/doc/1968689/\" id=\"a_169\">Section 17</a> of Limitation Act, 1963, the cause\n                             of action for the Respondent for its Counter Claims arose\n                             only on 13.07.2017 and 31.12.2017. The limitation period of\n                             3 years is therefore, deemed to commence at least on those\n                             dates and the Counterclaim had to be filed in Arbitration\n                             proceedings within 3 years limitation period, therefrom.\n                             xii. During the oral arguments, as evidenced by its written\n                             synopsis (RD-9), the Respondent had contended that as per\n                             Clause 10.(iv) of TOR of the Supervision Consultancy\n                             Agreement executed between NHAI &amp; Supervision\n                             Consultant, the Supervision Consultant was required to\n                             assist the Employer in all matters pertaining to Contract\n                             Management and as per Clause 10.(iii) of that TOR, the\n                             Project Director of NHAI had the authority to give\n                             directions to the Supervising Consultant in all routine\n                             matters related to the Contract management/ administration,\n                             which among other things included corrections in case of\n                             any laxity.

Moreover, Sub-Clause 60.9 of COPA aims at\n                        addressing such contingencies and Clause 2.6 of the GCC offers another\n                        avenue for the parties to revisit or revise any decisions, opinions,\n                        consents, expressions of satisfaction, approvals, value determinations, or\n                        actions done by the Engineer.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_251\">                        94.   Despite the aforementioned, it is evident that in addition to the\n                        Final Statement agreed upon by the parties, the respondent was obligated\n                        to provide a written discharge to the petitioner thereby confirming that\n                        the total amount in the Final Statement (comprising both parts (a) and (b),\n                        with the admissibility of part (b) being subject to the Dispute Resolution\n                        Mechanism) constitutes full and final settlement of all payments due to\n                        the Claimant. It is also worth noting that the respondent has not submitted\n                        this &quot;Written Discharge&quot; to the petitioner alongside the Final Statement.\n                        In its Additional Rejoinder dated August 7, 2019, the respondent asserted\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_667\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_668\">                        O.M.P.

The petitioner vehemently denied the aforesaid assertion made by\n                        the respondent. It further submitted that for a waiver to be valid, there\n                        must be a deliberate and voluntary surrender of a right. Additionally, the\n                        petitioner contends that waiver must be explicitly pleaded by raising a\n                        specific claim of waiver, which the respondent failed to do.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_253\">                        96.   The learned Arbitral Tribunal concurs with the petitioner&#x27;s\n                        argument that the respondent should have raised the plea of waiver in its\n                        pleadings, which it failed to do. Moreover, the Tribunal observed that the\n                        release of partial payment subsequent to the finalization of the Final\n                        Statement did not constitute a waiver of the contractual requirement for a\n                        Written Discharge, particularly when partial payments were regularly\n                        made based on the respondent&#x27;s monthly bills throughout the Contract\n                        duration, extending until the Statement of Completion, designated as <a href=\"/doc/1569253/\" id=\"a_191\">IPC</a>-\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_673\">                        73.</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_254\">                        97.   The Tribunal further opined that since the Financial Statement was\n                        not disputed/ challenged by the party under Clause 67, therefore the\n                        Financial Statement was deemed to be final. Therefore, the petitioner\n                        shall pay the amount as quantified in the Final Payment Certificate to the\n                        respondent. Moreover, the learned Tribunal rejected the counter claim of\n                        the petitioner on the ground that the subsequent certificates dated 13th\n                        July, 2017 and 31st July, 2017, could not be taken into consideration as\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_674\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_675\">                        O.M.P.

The petitioner has contended that the respondent is not entitled to\n                        claim any amount as per the aforesaid Final Payment Certificate since the\n                        Engineer revised its earlier certification as it was found that there were\n                        some errors in the claims of the respondent pertaining to certain rate of\n                        materials etc. Accordingly, the Engineer corrected the various quantities\n                        claimed by the respondent in the revised bill dated 13th July, 2017.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_257\">                        100.

It is further submitted that the certification was based on\n                        Final Statement agreed between the respondent and the Engineer as per\n                        sub-clause 60.11 of COPA.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_259\">                        102. It is contended that the petitioner had given partial payments to the\n                        respondent on the basis of the said certificate and therefore, they cannot\n                        raise a claim to challenge the same subsequently.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_260\">                        103.

In paragraph 26(xxxiii) and (xxxiv) of the impugned award, the\n                        learned Tribunal also categorically held that the certificate dated 31 st\n                        August, 2014 was not a Final Payment Certificate, and construed the\n                        same as the final statement as the steps such as issuance of discharge\n                        certificate were not complied with by the respondent herein. Therefore, it\n                        is amply clear that the learned Tribunal agreed with the contention of the\n                        petitioner that certificate dated 31st August, 2014 cannot be termed as the\n                        final certificate of payment.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_263\">                        106. The material on record clearly suggests that the learned Tribunal\n                        was apprised about the pending disputes between the parties, therefore,\n                        any certificate issued during the pendency of a dispute would not amount\n                        to Final Payment Certificate, and deciding the issues in favor of the\n                        respondent is a mistake of law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_264\">                        107. Furthermore, despite holding that the certificate dated 31 st August,\n                        2014 was not a Final Payment Certificate, the learned Tribunal\n                        erroneously directed the payment to be made to the respondent on the\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_686\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_687\">                        O.M.P.

As per the submissions made\n                        by the petitioner, the learned Tribunal erred in completely ignoring their\n                        contentions and therefore, the same amounts to violation of the principle\n                        of natural justice.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_266\">                        109.

However, as already\n                              indicated above, such a situation has arisen because of\n                              conflicting awards given by the Arbitral Tribunals\n                              themselves, which has provoked this Court to take a final\n                              view in the matter, necessitated by the aforesaid reason. If\n                              one takes into consideration the theory that one applies the\n                              principle mechanically i.e. that a plausible view is not to be\n                              interfered with, then it may lead to very anomalous situation.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_285\">                              In such an eventuality, view taken by a particular Arbitral\n                              Tribunal in favour of the contractor would be upheld as\n                              plausible view. Likewise, the Court will have to uphold the\n                              view taken by a particular Arbitral Tribunal in favour of\n                              NHAI as well as a plausible view. Therefore, the purpose is\n                              to avoid such a situation which cannot be permitted as it\n                              would result in upholding both kinds of arbitral awards\n                              interpreting the same clause, whether they go in favour of\n                              the employer or they go in favour of the contractor. When\n                              the exercise is done keeping in view these considerations and\n                              outcome thereof is not determined, interest of justice would\n                              also demand that this result has to be applied to the pending\n                              cases, which have not attained finality. Therefore, in these\n                              peculiar circumstances, we hold that the principle of issue\n                              estoppel will apply only in those cases where matters have\n                              attained finality and no judicial proceedings are pending. In\n                              all those cases, including the present one, where awards are\n                              challenged on this particular aspect, this judgment will\n                              govern the outcome.‖\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_286\">                        124.

As per the pleadings filed by the petitioner, the award passed in C-\n                        5 is also under challenge, however, the said issue has not been\n                        adjudicated, therefore, leaving the question open till date.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_288\">                        126. In the said award, the same Tribunal has held that the certificate\n                        issued on 31st August, 2014 cannot be deemed to be final one as the\n                        issuance of discharge has not been done by the respondents, therefore, not\n                        complying with the procedure <a href=\"/doc/116300740/\" id=\"a_205\">laid down in</a> the contract agreed between\n                        the parties leading to dismissal of their claim.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_289\">                        127. Even though this Court does not want to comment upon the\n                        findings of the learned Tribunal in the other award, the application of\n                        principles in the impugned award makes it evident that the learned\n                        Tribunal committed serious errors in the same and wrongly interpreted\n                        the contract, thereby, committing clear violation of the fundamental\n                        policy of this country.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_290\">                        128. Therefore, this Court is of the considered view that the findings\n                        arrived at by the learned Tribunal in the impugned award are incorrect\n                        and in complete violation of the principles of natural justice. Furthermore,\n                        even though the award passed in the other dispute by the same Tribunal is\n                        not being relied upon to arrive at the instant findings, this Court is of the\n                        clear view that the antithesis reasoning cannot be upheld in any manner.\n</p>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_291\">                        CONCLUSION\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_292\">                        129. The issue regarding interference in the international arbitration is\n                        no more res integra as the same has been dealt with by the Hon&#x27;ble\n                        Supreme Court in various cases where the scope of interference has been\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_742\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_743\">                        O.M.P.

As discussed in the foregoing paragraphs, the term public policy\n                        has been subject to judicial interpretation where the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme\n                        Court deemed it necessary to hold that the said term would be restricted\n                        to the domestic and not the international paraphernalia.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_294\">                        131. In the present case, the petitioner has made out a case to prove that\n                        the impugned award suffers from illegality as the same is against the\n                        public policy of this Country. There are multifold reasons for the same,\n                        firstly, the Tribunal erroneously directed payment of the due amount on\n                        the basis of same despite holding that the certificate dated 31st August,\n                        2014 was not a final payment certificate, a conclusion contrary to its own\n                        findings. Secondly, the non-adjudication of the contentions raised by the\n                        petitioner is a clear violation of the principles of natural justice and\n                        thirdly, the contrary opinions given by the same Tribunal in similar\n                        factual scenario creates a bizzare situation and the same cannot be\n                        permitted under the law.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_295\">                        132. In view of the same, this Court deems it appropriate to set aside the\n                        award dated 26th June, 2021 since the same is in contravention of the\n                        settled position of law and, therefore, against the public policy of the\n                        country.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_296\">                        133. In light of the foregoing discussions, the instant petition bearing\n                        No. 340/2021 is allowed and impugned award dated 26 th June, 2021 is set\n                        aside and the dispute is remanded back to the Arbitral Tribunal for fresh\n                        adjudication.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_297\">                        134.
