Jain Plastics and Chemicals\n\nLtd.</a> [(2002) 1 SCC 216] the Apex Court reiterated that a writ\n\npetition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is not the\n\nproper procedure for adjudicating disputes relating to the\n\nenforcement of contractual obligations. Under the law, it was\n\nopen to the respondent to approach the court of competent\n\njurisdiction for appropriate relief for breach of contract. It is\n\nsettled law that when an alternative and equally efficacious\n\nremedy is open to the litigant, he should be required to pursue\n\nthat remedy and not invoke the writ jurisdiction of the High\n\nCourt. Equally, the existence of an alternative remedy does not\n\naffect the jurisdiction of the court to issue a writ, but ordinarily,\n\nthat would be a good ground for refusing to exercise the\n\ndiscretion under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_5\">Article 226.</a> It is true that many matters could\n\nbe decided after referring to the contentions raised in the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">                                   5</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">W.P.(C)No.2087 of 2024</span>\n\n\naffidavits and counter-affidavits, but that would hardly be a\n\nground for the exercise of extraordinary jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_6\">Article\n\n226</a> of the Constitution in case of an alleged breach of contract.\n\nWhether     the   alleged   non-supply   of   road   permits   by   the\n\nappellants would justify a breach of contract by the respondent\n\nwould depend upon facts and evidence and is not required to be\n\ndecided or dealt with in a writ petition. Such seriously disputed\n\nquestions or rival claims of the parties with regard to breach of\n\ncontract are to be investigated and determined on the basis of\n\nevidence which may be led by the parties in a properly instituted\n\ncivil suit rather than by a court exercising the prerogative of\n\nissuing writs.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_7\">      6.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"191872\" id=\"span_6\">In <a href=\"/doc/191872/\" id=\"a_7\">National Highways Authority of India v. Ganga\n\nEnterprises</a> [(2003) 7 SCC 410] the Apex Court was dealing\n\nwith a case in which the respondent had filed a writ petition\n\nbefore the High Court for refund of the amount. The High Court\n\nposed two questions, namely, (a) whether the forfeiture of the\n\nsecurity deposit is without the authority of law and without any\n\nbinding contract between the parties and also contrary to <a href=\"/doc/931937/\" id=\"a_8\">Section\n\n5</a> of the Contract Act; and (b) whether the writ petition is\n\nmaintainable in a claim arising out of breach of contract.

The Apex Court noticed that those\n\nare cases where the writ court was enforcing a statutory right or\n\nduty. These cases do not lay down that a writ court can interfere\n\nin   a    matter     of    contract   only.   Thus,   on   the    ground   of\n\nmaintainability, the writ petition should have been dismissed.</span></span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">         7.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1141333\" id=\"span_14\">In <a href=\"/doc/1141333/\" id=\"a_15\">Gunwant          Kaur v.      Municipal         Committee,\n\nBhatinda</a> [(1969) 3 SCC 769] the Apex Court opined that the\n\nHigh Court is not deprived of its jurisdiction to entertain a\n\npetition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_16\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India merely\n\nbecause in considering the petitioner&#x27;s right to relief questions of\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                    7</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">W.P.(C)No.2087 of 2024</span>\n\n\nfact may fall to be determined. In a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_17\">Article 226</a>,\n\nthe High Court has jurisdiction to try issues both of fact and\n\nlaw. It is true that exercise of the jurisdiction is discretionary,\n\nbut the discretion must be exercised on sound judicial principles.\n\nWhen the petition raises questions of fact of a complex nature,\n\nwhich may for their determination require oral evidence to be\n\ntaken, and on that account the High Court is of the view that the\n\ndispute may not appropriately be tried in a writ petition, the High\n\nCourt may decline to try a petition. Rejection of a petition in\n\nlimine will normally be justified, where the High Court is of the\n\nview that the petition is frivolous or because of the nature of the\n\nclaim made dispute sought to be agitated, or that the petition\n\nagainst the party against whom relief is claimed is not\n\nmaintainable or that the dispute raised thereby is such that it\n\nwould be inappropriate to try it in the writ jurisdiction, or for\n\nanalogous reasons.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_9\">      8.    <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"113707\" id=\"span_17\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1141333\" id=\"span_18\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1943124\" id=\"span_19\">In <a href=\"/doc/1943124/\" id=\"a_18\">ABL       International   Ltd. v.

In Gunwant Kaur [(1969) 3\n\nSCC 769] the Court even went to the extent of holding that in a\n\nwrit petition, if the facts require, even oral evidence can be\n\ntaken. This clearly shows that in an appropriate case, the writ\n\ncourt has the jurisdiction to entertain a writ petition involving\n\ndisputed questions of fact and there is no absolute bar for\n\nentertaining a writ petition even if the same arises out of a\n\ncontractual obligation and/or involves some disputed questions\n\nof fact.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_10\">      9.

However, while entertaining an objection as to the\n      maintainability of a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_22\">Article 226</a> of the\n      Constitution of India, the Court should bear in mind the\n      fact that the power to issue prerogative writs under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_23\">Article\n      226</a> of the Constitution is plenary in nature and is not\n      limited by any other provisions of the Constitution. The\n      High Court having regard to the facts of the case, has the\n      discretion to entertain or not to entertain a writ petition.\n      The Court has imposed upon itself certain restrictions in\n      the    exercise    of    this       power.        See:   <a href=\"/doc/1885496/\" id=\"a_24\">Whirlpool\n      Corpn. v.

That    writ    petition     ended        in    dismissal.   He   filed\n\nW.A.No.1912 of 2013.

The Division Bench,\n\non the basis of the report of the Advocate Commission, came to\n\nthe conclusion that the order of termination was founded on\n\nerroneous facts, inasmuch as the competent authority had\n\nopined that more than 50% of the work remained to be done.\n\nThe Division Bench opined that, as there was a factual defect,\n\nwhich was evident from the report of the Advocate Commission,\n\nthe order of termination of the contract is liable to be quashed.\n\nAfter quashing the said order, the Division Bench directed the\n\nSuperintending Engineer, Public Works Department (Roads and\n\nBridges) to consider and dispose of the matter afresh after\n\naffording the contractor an opportunity of being heard. It also\n\ndirected that the Commission&#x27;s report and the Engineer&#x27;s report\n\nand the accounts shall be produced by the Contractor before the\n\ncompetent authority, who shall take the same into account\n\nbefore taking a final decision in the matter.

The     High   Court    appointed     a\n\nCommission to collect the evidence, accepted the same without\n\ncalling for objections from the respondent, and quashed the\n\norder of termination of the contract.

The Court thought it apt, merely because something\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                  12</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">W.P.(C)No.2087 of 2024</span>\n\n\nis disputed by the insurer, it should not enter into the realm of\n\ndisputed questions of fact. In fact, there was no disputed\n\nquestion of fact, but it required interpretation of the terms of the\n\ncontract of insurance. Similarly, if the materials that come on\n\nrecord from which it is clearly evincible, the writ court may\n\nexercise the power of judicial review.</span></span></span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">      12.   It is well settled that, where the rights which are\n\nsought to be agitated are purely of a private character no\n\nmandamus can be claimed. Even if the relief is sought against\n\nthe State or its instrumentality, the precondition for the issuance\n\nof a writ of mandamus is a public duty. In a dispute based on a\n\npurely contractual relationship, there being no public duty\n\nelement, a writ of mandamus would not lie.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_18\">      13. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1893286\" id=\"span_35\">In <a href=\"/doc/1893286/\" id=\"a_33\">Bareilly Development Authority v.

In Bishwanath Tea Company Ltd. [(1981) 3 SCC\n\n238] the Apex Court considered the question of maintainability\n\nof a writ petition in respect of a claim arising out of the\n\ncontractual rights and obligations flowing from the terms of a\n\nlease. The Apex Court held that, it is undoubtedly true that High\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                  14</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">W.P.(C)No.2087 of 2024</span>\n\n\nCourt can entertain in its extraordinary jurisdiction a petition to\n\nissue any of the prerogative writs for any other purpose. But\n\nsuch writ can be issued where there is executive action\n\nunsupported by law or even in respect of a corporation there is a\n\ndenial of equality before law or equal protection of law. The\n\nCorporation can also file a writ petition for enforcement of a right\n\nunder a statute. On the facts of the case on hand, the Apex\n\nCourt    noticed    that   Bishwanath   Tea   Company    Ltd.,   the\n\nrespondent company, was merely trying to enforce a contractual\n\nobligation. The obligation to pay royalty for timber cut and felled\n\nand removed is prescribed by the relevant regulations. The\n\nvalidity of regulations is not challenged. Therefore, the demand\n\nfor royalty is unsupported by law. What the respondent claimed\n\nwas an exception that in view of a certain term in the indenture\n\nof lease, i.e., clause 2, the appellant is not entitled to demand\n\nand collect royalty from the respondent. This is nothing but\n\nenforcement of a term of a contract of lease. Hence, the\n\nquestion was whether such contractual obligation can be\n\nenforced by the High Court in its writ jurisdiction. Ordinarily,\n\nwhere a breach of contract is complained of, a party complaining\n\nof such breach may sue for specific performance of the contract,\n\nif the contract is capable of being specifically performed, or the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                      15</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_44\">W.P.(C)No.2087 of 2024</span>\n\n\nparty may sue for damages. Such a suit would ordinarily be\n\ncognisable by the civil court. The High Court in its extraordinary\n\njurisdiction would not entertain a petition either for specific\n\nperformance of a contract or for recovering damages. A right to\n\nrelief flowing from a contract has to be claimed in a civil court\n\nwhere a suit for specific performance of a contract or for\n\ndamages could be filed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_21\">      16.   The legal principles that can be culled out from the\n\ndecisions referred to supra are that, in a case where the contract\n\nentered into between the State and the person aggrieved is of a\n\nnon-statutory character and the relationship is governed purely\n\nin terms of a contract between the parties, the contractual\n\nobligations are matters of private law and a writ would not lie to\n\nenforce a civil liability arising purely out of a contract. The proper\n\nremedy in such cases would be to file a civil suit for claiming\n\ndamages, injunctions or specific performance or such appropriate\n\nreliefs in a competent civil court. Pure contractual obligation in\n\nthe   absence     of     any   statutory   complexion   would   not   be\n\nenforceable through a writ.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">      17.   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"77081689\" id=\"span_45\">In <a href=\"/doc/77081689/\" id=\"a_40\">Joshi Technologies International Inc. v.

The distinction between public law and private law\n            element in the contract with the State is getting\n            blurred. However, it has not been totally obliterated\n            and where the matter falls purely in private field of\n            contract, this Court has maintained the position that\n            writ petition is not maintainable. The dichotomy\n            between public law and private law rights and\n            remedies would depend on the factual matrix of\n            each case and the distinction between the public law\n            remedies     and   private   law   field,   cannot   be\n            demarcated with precision. In fact, each case has to\n            be examined, on its facts whether the contractual\n            relations between the parties bear insignia of public\n            element. Once on the facts of a particular case it is\n            found that nature of the activity or controversy\n            involves public law element, then the matter can be\n            examined by the High Court in writ petitions under\n            <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India to see\n            whether action of the State and/or instrumentality\n            or agency of the State is fair, just and equitable or\n            that relevant factors are taken into consideration\n            and irrelevant factors have not gone into the\n            decision-making process or that the decision is not\n            arbitrary.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_54\">                                    20</span><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_26\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_55\">W.P.(C)No.2087 of 2024</span>\n\n\n      70.10.
