The agreement\t included  a\nclause\tthat  the contract would be subject to the  &quot;  usual\nForce  Majeure clause &quot;, the Bye-laws of East  India  Cotton\nAssociation  Ltd., Bombay, except bye-law 35, the said\tBye-\nlaws having statutory force, and to the jurisdiction of\t the\nBombay High Court.  Clause 6 of the agreement provided\tthat\nthe buyers were to obtain import licence from the Government\nof India, failing which the seller would be entitled  either\nto  carry over the goods at the cost of the buyers  or\tcall\nupon  them to take immediate delivery on payment in  British\nEast  Africa,  and in default to sell the goods\t in  British\nEast  Africa  and  claim the deficit,  if  any\tbetween\t the\ncontractual price and the price obtained on re-sale.  Clause\n7  further provided that notwithstanding the  import  policy\nfollowed by the Government of India in respect of the import\nof the contracted goods, the buyers would be bound to obtain\nthe  necessary import licences and communicate\tthe  numbers\nthereof to the sellers on specified dates, failing which cl.\n6  would operate.  The buyers did not perform  the  contract\nand  the sellers after notice to them re-sold the goods\t and\nthereafter  claimed the deficit which the,buyers refused  to\npay.   The  sellers invoked the arbitration clause  and\t the\nrules  contained in bye-law 38A of the Bye-laws\t and  others\nfollowing  it, which conferred on the Chairman of the  Board\nof Directors of the East India Cotton Association Ltd.,\t the\npower  of  selecting  the  arbitrator  or  arbitrators,\t and\napplied\t to  the  High\tCourt under  s.\t 20  of\t the  Indian\nArbitration  Act for filing the agreement and referring\t the\ndispute\t to arbitration.  The buyers resisted and the  trial\njudge  dismissed  the application, but the Court  of  appeal\nreversed  that\tdecision.   It was urged in  this  Court  on\nbehalf\tof  the buyers that (1) cls. 6\tand  7\tcontemplated\nacquisition  of\t property  or Exchange in  Africa  and\tthus\ninvolved a breach of<a href=\"/doc/1391486/\" id=\"a_3\"> S. 5</a> of the Foreign Exchange Regulation\nAct, since no general or special exemption had been  granted\nthereunder  by the Reserve Bank, (2) that the  expression  &quot;\nsubject\t to the usual Force Majeure clause &quot; was  vague\t and\nuncertain  and\trendered the agreement void,  (3)  that\t the\napplication  of\t bye-law 48A et seq left no  powers  in\t the\nCourt to act under sub-ss. (1) and (4) of<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_4\"> S. 20n</a>\n<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_5\">1021</a>\nof the Arbitration Act and the section was thus inapplicable\nand  (4) that the law applicable to the case was the law  of\nBritish East Africa and not that of India.\nHeld, that the contentions must fail.\nThe  provisions\t of  sub-ss. (2) and (3) of  s.\t 21  of\t the\n<a href=\"/doc/27905/\" id=\"a_6\">Foreign Exchange Regulation Act</a>, properly construed, left no\nmanner\tof doubt that they contemplated matters\t which\twere\nwithin the prohibition of<a href=\"/doc/1091250/\" id=\"a_7\"> S. 5</a> of the Act and had the effect\nof  engrafting\ton the agreement of parties a term  that  it\nwould  be for the decreeholder before he could\tenforce\t the\ndecree or order of the court to obtain the permission of the\nReserve\t Bank  and were thus designed to  prevent  the\tnon-\nperformance of the contract under a cover of illegality.\nThe  contract  involved\t no actual or  contingent  right  to\nacquisition of property abroad, and even assuming it did, it\nwas  saved  by<a href=\"/doc/157537/\" id=\"a_8\"> s. 21</a> of the Act subject to  its\t conditions.\nThe agreement was thus enforceable.\nNor  was  the contract void for uncertainty.  It  was  clear\nfrom judicial decisions that a reference to &quot;force majeure &quot;\nmeans\tthe  saving  of\t the  performing  party\t  from\t the\nconsequence of factors beyond his control.  The condition in\nrespect\t of  &quot;force majeure &quot; did not, therefore&quot;  make\t the\ncontract vague.\t Further, the use of the word &quot; usual &quot; made\nit  clear that the clause could be made certain by  evidence\nand so it was protected by<a href=\"/doc/1818467/\" id=\"a_9\"> S. 29</a> of the Contract Act.\nLebeaupin v.

It must not be\noverlooked that although the present was a case of statutory\narbitration  governed by its own rules, the court  under  <a href=\"/doc/638888/\" id=\"a_12\">S.\n20(4)</a> of the Arbitration Act had   two distinct powers,\t (1)\nof judicially considering whether or not     the arbitration\nagreement should be filed in court and (2)   whether   there\nshould\tbe  a  reference to the\t arbitrator  or\t arbitrators\nappointed  by the parties or selected by it.  Since  in\t the\ninstant\t case the parties had by their\tagreement  empowered\nthe  Chairman  of the Board of Directors of the\t East  India\nCotton\tAssociation,  Ltd.,  to\t select\t the  arbitrator  or\narbitrators, the court could send the agreement to him to be\ndealt with under the pro, cedure laid by the said Bye-laws.\n1022\nWhether the law of the country where the contract is made or\nof  the country where it is to be performed should apply  is\nsometimes  a  matter  of  presumption.\t But  the   declared\nintention of the parties overrides such presumption.   Where\nthere is no such declaration, the intention may be  inferred\nfrom  the terms and nature of the contract and\tthe  general\ncircumstances of the case.\nIn  the instant case, since the parties agreed that in\tcase\nof dispute the Bombay High Court would have jurisdiction and\nthe arbitration clause indicated arbitration in India, there\ncould be no doubt that the Indian law was to apply.\nN.

The sellers wrote as\tmany\nas  five  letters between March 1, 1958, and May  26,  1958,\nbefore\tthey received a reply from the buyers dated June  3,\n1958.\tBy  that time, the sellers had carried\tforward\t the\ncontract,  and\talso  invoked their right  of  resale  after\ngiving\tnotice, and claimed Rs. 34,103. 15 nP. for  which  a\ndebit  note had been issued.  This note was returned by\t the\nbuyers\twith  a\t letter of June 3, 1958,  stating  that\t the\ncontract was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">1025</span>\nvoid and/or illegal&quot;, that they were not obliged to  perform\nit,  that there was no right of any sale on their.,  account\nand/or\ton their behalf, and that the alleged&quot; sale was\t not\nbinding upon them. [Ex.\t &quot; D &quot; (Colly) No. 6.]\nThe  sellers  then  invoked the arbitration  clause  of\t the\nagreement and Bye-law 38-A of the Bye-laws of the East India\nCotton Association, Ltd., Bombay, and moved the Bombay\tHigh\nCourt,\ton  the\t Original Side, under s. 20  of\t the  Indian\nArbitration  Act, requesting that the agreement be filed  in\nCourt  and the dispute referred to arbitration.\t The  buyers\nappeared,  and resisted the petition on grounds\t which\tthey\nset  forth in affidavits filed from time to time.  By  their\nfirst  affidavit dated July 31, 1958, the  buyers  contended\nthat  cls.  6  and 7, quoted above, were  unlawful,  as\t the\nliability  created under them amounted to a contravention  &quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">of  the\t import\t policy of Government of  India\t &quot;  and\t the\n<a href=\"/doc/27905/\" id=\"a_13\">Foreign\t Exchange Regulation Act, 1947</a>, and the\t Rules\tmade\nthereunder.  They contended that, in view of the  invalidity\nof  the contract as a whole, the arbitration clause  in\t the\nagreement was not binding, and that the agreement could\t not\nbe  filed.   In\t the second affidavit  which  was  filed  on\nFebruary  4,  1959, they added the reason that the  words  &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_6\">subject\t to the usual Force Majeure Clause &quot; were vague\t and\nuncertain,  and made the contract&#x27; void ab initio, as  there\nwas  no\t consensus  ad\titem  between  the  parties.\tThey\ncontended  that the con. tract being void,  the\t arbitration\nclause\twas  also void.\t By yet another affidavit  filed  on\nFebruary  27,  1959,  they averred  that  the  letter  dated\nNovember  30, 1957, was void, being in contravention of\t the\nImport Trade Control Act and the Foreign Exchange Regulation\nAct  and the Rules made under the two Acts, inasmuch as\t the\nconsideration  was  one forbidden by law and was  likely  to\ndefeat\tthe  provisions of law.\t They also stated  that\t the\nwords &quot; if necessary &quot; in that letter rendered the  contract\nvoid ab initio for vagueness and uncertainty.\nThe case was heard by K. T. Desai, J. (as he then war,).  On\nMarch 3, 1959, the learned Judge dismissed\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_4\">1026</span>\nthe  petition  as not maintainable on the ground  that\t,the\ndispute\t was about the legality or validity of the  contract\nincluding  the agreement about arbitration, and that such  a\ndispute could only be considered under<a href=\"/doc/874260/\" id=\"a_14\"> ss. 32</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_15\">33</a> of\t the\nArbitration Act by the Court and not by the arbitrator in  a\nreference  under<a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_16\"> s. 20</a> of the Act.  He declined to  consider\nthe question under the former sections, because the petition\nhad not asked for that relief, observing that if by a proper\npetition  the  question were raised, it\t would\tbe  decided.\nAgainst\t the order of the learned Judge (0.  S.), an  appeal\nwas  filed  by\tthe  sellers.\tThis  appeal  was  heard  by\nChainani, C. J. and S. T. Desai, J. on April 28, 1959.\t The\nlearned Judges held that a claim was made by the sellers and\nwas  denied  by the buyers; that there was  thus  a  dispute\narising out of or in relation to a contract as\tcontemplated\nby Bye-law 38-A; that in showing cause against the  petition\nunder  s. 20, the buyers had averred that the  contract\t was\nillegal and void; and that such a question could be  decided\nby  the\t Court\tbefore making the  reference.\tThe  learned\nJudges\tpointed out that a petition under ss. 32 and  33  of\nthe  Indian  Arbitration Act questioning  the  existence  or\nvalidity of an arbitration agreement was not to be  expected\nfrom one making a claim under a contract, that the plea\t was\nalways\tlikely to be raised by one resisting  the  petition,\nand that when such a plea was raised, the Court must  decide\nit,  even though the proceedings be under<a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_17\"> s. 20</a> of  the\t Act\nfor  making a reference.  The case was, therefore,  remanded\nwith the following direction:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">&quot;  As the respondents have challenged the validity  of\tthis\nagreement,  the\t Court\twill have to  decide  this  question\nbefore passing further orders in the matter.  Accordingly we\nset  aside  the\t order passed by Mr. Justice  K.  T.  Desai,\ndismissing the petition filed by the petitioners, and remand\nthe  matter to the trial court for deciding the\t objections,\nraised by the respondent under sub-section (3) of <a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_18\">section 20</a>\nof  the\t Act, to the arbitration agreement  being  filed  in\nCourt,\tand then disposing of the matter in accordance\twith\nlaw.&quot;\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_5\">1027</span>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_7\">When the case went back for retrial, the buyers filed  their\nfourth affidavit on November 16, 1959.\tThey stated in\tthat\naffidavit  that Bye-law 38-A was a statutory Bye-law of\t the\nEast  India Cotton Association, Ltd., Bombay,  a  recognised\nInstitution under the <a href=\"/doc/148970782/\" id=\"a_19\">Forward Contracts Regulation Act</a>,\t No.\n74  of 1952, and that<a href=\"/doc/714093/\" id=\"a_20\"> s. 46</a> of the Arbitration Act  was\t ap-\nplicable.   They contended that inasmuch as the Bye-laws  of\nthe    Association   prescribed\t  a   different\t   machinery\ninconsistent with and repugnant to<a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_21\"> s. 20</a> of the\t Arbitration\nAct,  the  latter  section was inapplicable,  and  that\t the\npetition  was incompetent.  By his order dated\tNovember  26\nand 27,1959, K. T. Desai, J. hold that the petition did\t not\ndisclose sufficient materials, and that the sellers were not\nentitled  to  have the agreement of reference filed,  or  to\nhave  an order of reference made.  Though be held  that\t the\nBye-laws  of  the East India Cotton Association,  Ltd.\twere\nstatutory,  and\t that<a href=\"/doc/714093/\" id=\"a_22\"> ss. 46</a> and <a href=\"/doc/1886363/\" id=\"a_23\">47</a> of the  Arbitration\t Act\napplied, he was of opinion that<a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_24\"> s. 20</a> could not be  invoked,\nbecause no action under sub-s. (4) of a. 20 could be  taken.\nThe  reason given by the learned Judge was that\t under\tthat\nsub-section  the Court had to appoint an arbitrator, if\t the\nparties\t failed\t to  agree, and\t that  sub-section  was\t not\napplicable,  because the machinery of Bye-law 38-A  left  no\npower  of action to the Court.\tHe also felt that there\t was\nno averment in the petition that the parties had not agreed.\nOn  the\t rest of the points raised by the  buyers  in  their\naffidavits,  the learned Judge held against them.   He\theld\nthat, in view of<a href=\"/doc/18266199/\" id=\"a_25\"> ss. 21(2)</a> and <a href=\"/doc/18266199/\" id=\"a_26\">21(3)</a> of the Foreign Exchange\nRegulation Act, there was no infringement of that Act by the\nagreement  entered into, though he expressed a doubt if\t the\nwords &quot; legal proceedings &quot; in<a href=\"/doc/157537/\" id=\"a_27\"> s. 21(3)</a> were wide enough  to\ninclude\t an  arbitration.  He also held that cl.  7  of\t the\nconditions under which the contract was to be performed was,\nat  least  in part and under certain  circumstances,  not  a\ncontravention of the Import and Export Control Act, 1947, or\nthe Import Trade Control Order issued Under<a href=\"/doc/1529130/\" id=\"a_28\"> ss. 3</a> and 4-A of\nthat Act, and thus not wholly void.  He held lastly that the\ncontract was not void for vagueness or\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_6\">1028</span>\nuncertainty  either  on account of the reference  to  &quot;\t the\nusual  Force  Majeure Clause &quot;, or because of the  words  if\nnecessary &quot; in the letter of November 30, 1957.\nThe sellers appealed against the dismissal of the  petition,\nand  the buyers cross-objected against the adverse  findings\nand  the  disallowance of costs.  The  appeal was  heard  by\nTarkunde  and Chitale, JJ., and by separate  but  concurring\njudgments,  the appeal was allowed and\tthe  cross-objection\ndismissed,  and\t the  buyers  were  ordered  to\t pay   costs\nthroughout.   The Divisional Bench agreed with K. T.  Desai,\nJ.  on\tall the points decided by him  against\tthe  buyers.\nThey left open the question whether &quot; legal proceedings &quot; in<a href=\"/doc/18266199/\" id=\"a_29\">\ns.  21(3)</a> of the Foreign Exchange Regulation Act  were\twide\nenough\tto  include an arbitration for the decision  of\t the\narbitrators  to be appointed, and addressing  themselves  to\nthe question raised about<a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_30\"> s. 20</a>, held that the petition\t was\nmaintainable.\tThey  were of opinion that the\tCourt  could\norder  the  arbitration agreement to be filed  and  also  to\nrefer the dispute to arbitrators to be chosen in  accordance\nwith  Bye-law  38-A,  though they felt that  if\t the  latter\naction\tcould  not be taken, at least the  first  could\t be,\nbecause\t the  procedural part could not\t destroy  the  power\nconferred to file the agreement.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_8\">In  this appeal, all the arguments which had  failed  before\nthe  High Court were urged before us.  Shortly stated,\tthey\nare:  that the contract was void (a) for illegality and\t (b)\nfor  uncertainty  and  vagueness on two\t grounds;  that\t the\npetition  under\t s.  20 of the Indian  Arbitration  Act\t was\nincompetent, as that section was inapplicable; and that\t the\nlaw governing the parties was not the Indian law but the law\nof  British  East  Africa.  We shall  now  deal\t with  these\ncontentions.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_9\">The first contention is that cl. 7 of the agreement involves\na  breach of the <a href=\"/doc/27905/\" id=\"a_31\">Foreign Exchange Regulation Act</a>.

In our opinion, the argument is without\nfoundation.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_16\">The contention, that on resale the price would have  accrued\nto the buyers in the first instance, as the sellers would be\nacting\tas the agents of the buyers, is also incorrect.\t  It\nhas  been  rightly pointed out by K. T. Desai, J.  that\t the\nright  of  resale given by<a href=\"/doc/1872186/\" id=\"a_42\"> ss. 54(2)</a> and (4) of\t the  Indian\nSale of Goods Act is exercised by the seller for himself and\nnot  as\t an agent of the buyer, when the latter is  given  a\nnotice of sale.\t This is indeed clear from the fact that the\nbuyer  is  not\tentitled to the profit\ton  resale  in\tthat\ncontingency,  though  liable for damages.  The\tposition  is\ndifferent when no notice is so sent.  Then the profits go to\nthe buyer.  Perhaps, in that event it may be possible to say\nthat  the  seller acted as an agent.  But, in  the  case  of\nresale\twith prior notice, there is no payment to the  buyer\nand no contravention of the <a href=\"/doc/27905/\" id=\"a_43\">Foreign Exchange Regulation Act</a>.\nThe  contention that the contract involved an actual or,  at\nleast,\ta  contingent right to or  acquisition\tof  property\nabroad is not correct.\tEven if it were so, the contract  is\nsaved  by<a href=\"/doc/18266199/\" id=\"a_44\"> s. 21</a>, as already explained.\tIn our opinion,\t the\ncontract was not void for illegality.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_17\">The  agreement is said to be void because of  vagueness\t and\nuncertainty arising from the use of the phrase &quot; subject  to\nthe usual force majeure clause &quot;. The argument is that there\nwas  no\t consensus  ad idem, and that the  parties  had\t not\nspecified  which force majeure clause they had in mind.\t  We\nwere taken through the Encyclopaedia of Forms and Precedents\nand  shown  a number of force majeure  clauses,\t which\twere\ndifferent.  We were also taken through a number of  rulings,\nin which the expression force majeure &quot; had been  expounded,\nto  show that, there is no consistent or  definite  meaning.\nThe  contention\t thus is that there being  no  consensus  ad\nidem,  the contract must fail for vagueness or\tuncertainty.\nThe  argument,\ton  the\t other side, is\t that  this  may  be\nregarded as a surplusage, and, if meaningless, ignored.\t  It\nis\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">1033</span>\ncontended by the respondents that the addition of the word &quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_21\">usual&quot;\tshows  that there was some clause which used  to  be\nincluded in such agreements.  The&#x27; respondents also refer to<a href=\"/doc/1818467/\" id=\"a_45\">\ns. 29</a> of the Indian Contract Act, which provides:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">&quot;Agreements, the meaning of which is not certain, or capable\nof being made certain, are void, &quot; and emphasise the words &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_18\">capable of being made certain &quot;, and contend that the clause\nwas  capable  of  being\t made certain,\tand  ex\t facie,\t the\nagreement was not void.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_19\">McCardie J. in Lebeaupin v. Crispin (1) has given an account\nof  what is meant by &quot;force majeure &quot; with reference to\t its\nhistory.   The\texpression &quot;force majeure &quot; is\tnot  a\tmere\nFrench\tversion of the Latin expression&quot; Vis major &quot;. It  is\nundoubtedly  a\tterm  of wider\timport.\t  Difficulties\thave\narisen in the past as to what could legitimately be included\nin &quot;force majeure &quot;. Judges have agreed that strikes, break-\ndown  of machinery, which, though normally not included\t in&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_23\">Vis Major&quot; are included in &quot;force majeure &quot;. An analysis  of\nrulings\t on  the subject into which it is not  necessary  in\nthis  case  to\tgo, shows that where reference\tis  made  to\n&quot;force\tmajeure &quot;, the intention is to save  the  performing\nparty from the consequences of anything over which he has no\ncontrol.  This is the widest meaning that can be given to  &quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">force  majeure\t&quot;, and even if this be the  meaning,  it  is\nobvious\t that the condition about &quot;force majeure, &quot;  in\t the\nagreement  was\tnot vague.  The use of the word\t &quot;  usual  &quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">makes  all the difference, and the meaning of the  condition\nmay  be\t made  certain by evidence  about  a  force  majeure\nclause, which was in contemplation of parties.\nLearned\t counsel  for the appellants relies strongly  on  a,\ndecision  of  McNair,  J. in British  Industries  v.  Patley\nPressings(2).\tThere, the expression used was\t&quot;subject  to\nforce  majeure conditions &quot;. The learned Judge held that  by\nconditions  &quot;  was meant. clauses and not  contingencies  or\ncircumstances,\tand  that  there being a  variety  of  force\nmajeure clauses in the trade, there\n(1) [1920] 2 K.B. 714.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">(2) [1953] 1 All E.R. 94.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">1034</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_21\">was  no\t concluded  agreement.\tThe:  case  is\tdistinguish.\nable,  because\tthe reference to force majeure\tclauses\t was\nleft at large.\tThe addition of the word &quot; usual &quot; makes  it\nclear that here some specific clause was in the\t  minds\t  of\nthe parties.  Learned counsel also relies upon a decision of\nthe House of Lords in Scammell (G.) and Nephew\t  Ltd.\t  v.\nOuston (H.C. and J.G.) (1), where the reference to &quot; on hire\npurchase  terms&quot;  was held to be too vague to  constitute  a\nconcluded contract.  It will appear from the decision of the\nHouse of Lords that the clause was held to be vague, because\nno precise meaning could be attributed to it, there being  a\nvariety\t of  hire  purchase clauses.  The use  of  the\tword\n&quot;usual&quot;\t here,\tenables evidence to be led to  make  certain\nwhich clause was, in fact, meant.  The case of the House of,\nLords  does not, therefore, apply.  Both the cases to  which\nwe  have referred were decided after parties had entered  on\nevidence, which is not the case here.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">Our  case is more analogous to the decision referred  to  in\nBishop &amp; Baxter Ld. v.

There, the clause was &quot; This bill  of\nlading\t&quot;, whereas the document to which it referred  was  a\ncharter-party.\t Viscount Simonds summarised all  the  rules\napplicable to construction of commercial documents, and laid\ndown   that  effort  should  always  be\t made  to   construe\ncommercial agreements broadly and one must not be astute  to\nfind defects in them, or reject them as meaningless.\nApplying these tests to the present case and in the light of\nthe  provisions of<a href=\"/doc/1818467/\" id=\"a_46\"> s. 29</a> of the Indian Contract Act,  it  is\nclear  that  the clause impugned is capable  of\t being\tmade\ncertain and definite by proof that between the parties or in\nthe  trade  or\tin dealings with  parties  in  British\tEast\nAfrica, there was invariably included a force majeure clause\nof a particular kind.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_25\">In &#x27;our opinion, the contract was not void for vagueness  or\nuncertainty by reason of the reference in the terms  stated,\nto  the\t force\tmajeure\t clause.   Mr.\tDaphtary  posed\t the\nquestion  as to on whom was the burden of proving the  usual\nforce  majeure clause.\tIn our opinion if the  agreement  is\nnot  void for uncertainty, that question would be  a  matter\nfor the decision of the arbitrators.  It is too early to say\nby what evidence and by whom the usual force, majeure clause\nmust be established.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_26\">The  next ground on which it is said that the agreement\t was\nvoid for uncertainty has reference to the employment of\t the\nwords &quot; if necessary &quot; in the letter of November, 30,  1957.\nThe effect of that letter is to make an alteration in cl.  6\nof the agreement, which has been quoted already.

In\nour opinion, this argument has no force whatever.  Under cl.\n6,  the sellers had an absolute discretion either  to  carry\nover  the  goods or to insist on delivery being\t taken.\t  By\nthis  letter, they have said that, if necessary, that is  to\nsay. if the buyers find it difficult to supply the number of\nthe  import licence, the contract would be carried  over  to\nMarch and April.  By this amendment, the sellers surrendered\nto  a certain extent their absolute discretion.\t The  clause\nmeans that the contract was not extended to March and April,\nbut  that  the sellers would extend it to that\tperiod,.  if\noccasion  demanded.  Since both the parties agreed  to\tthis\nletter\tand the buyers confirmed it, it cannot be said\tthat\nthere was no consensus ad idem, or that the whole  agreement\nis void for uncertainty.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_29\">We  shall  now consider the next argument,  which  was\tvery\nearnestly  urged,  before  us.\t It is that  s.\t 20  of\t the\n<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_47\">Arbitration  Act</a> cannot be made applicable to this  case  at\nall.   We  have already quoted extracts from  the  agreement\nwhich  include the clause by which the Bye-laws of the\tEast\nIndia Cotton Association Ltd., Bombay, were applied to\tthis\ncontract, except Bye law 35,which deals with arbitration  on\nquality\t in  case  of East  African  cotton.   Bye-law\t1(B)\nrelates to East African cotton, and it says that Bye-laws  1\nto  46\tinclusive (with certain exceptions) shall  apply  to\ncontracts  in  respect\tof  East  African  cotton.   It\t was\nconceded  before the High Court and also before us that\t the\nBye-laws  are  statutory.. The buyers were  members  of\t the\nAssociation  but  not  the  sellers;  but  the\tBye-laws  on\narbitration,   with   which  we\t  are\tconcerned,   include\narbitrations between a member and a\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">1037</span>\nnon-member.   We are concerned directly with  Bye-law  38-A.\nBye-law 38-A in its opening portion, reads:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">\t      All  unpaid claims, whether admitted  or\tnot,\n\t      and all disputes (other than those relating to\n\t      quality)\tarising\t out of or  in\trelation  to\n\t      contracts\t  (whether  forward  or\t ready\t and\n\t      whether  between members or between a,  member\n\t      and  a non-member) made subject to these\tBye-\n\t      laws  shall be referred to the arbitration  of\n\t      two disinterested persons one to be chosen  by\n\t      each party.  The arbitrators shall have  power\n\t      to  appoint an umpire and shall do so  if\t and\n\t      when they differ as to their award.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">Then  follow  certain provisions, which\t were  stressed\t but\nwhich  need not be quoted in extension Shortly stated,\tthey\nare  that the arbitrators must make their award in 15  days,\nunless\ttime be extended by the Chairman.  The umpire is  to\nbe  appointed within 15 days or such extended period as\t may\nbe fixed by the Chairman and the umpire is to make his award\nwithin 10 days, unless time be extended by the Chairman.  In\ncase  of  disagreement or failure of a party to\t appoint  an\narbitrator,  the  Chairman may appoint\tan  arbitrator,\t and\nsimilarly  the Chairman is to appoint the umpire and he\t may\neven  appoint  himself.\t Other powers are conferred  on\t the\nChairman,  who is the Chairman of the Board of Directors  of\nthe East India Cotton Association Ltd.\nThe  contention is that arbitrations under  the\t <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_48\">Arbitration\nAct</a>,  like  those  under  Sch.\t11  <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_49\">of\tthe  Code  of  Civil\nProcedure</a>,  are of three kinds described by Lord  Macnaghten\nin  Ghulam  Jilani  v.

III  makes\t  it\napplicable  also to arbitrations, in which  the\t arbitration\nagreement  is  asked  to  be filed in  Court  under  s.\t 20,\nsubject,  however, to this that the provisions of any  other\nenactment or rules made thereunder, if inconsistent with the\n<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_66\">Arbitration Act</a>, are to prevail.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_36\">Learned\t counsel  for the buyers contends  that\t nothing  is\nsaved  of  the Act.  This is not correct.   To\tbegin  with,\nquestions  as to the existence or validity of the  agreement\nare saved from decisions by arbitrators or umpires,  however\nappointed.   Since such a plea can only be raised in bar  of\nan   application   by  persons\tseeking\t  a   reference\t  to\narbitration, at least that portion of the Act still applies,\nand  that power can only be exercised by the  Court.   Other\nprovisions  of Chap.  II, like<a href=\"/doc/1294263/\" id=\"a_67\"> ss. 15</a> and <a href=\"/doc/109140/\" id=\"a_68\">16</a>,  still  remain\napplicable.   We need not give a list of all the  provisions\nwhich may be saved, because that will involve an examination\nside by side, of the sections of the Act and the  provisions\nof  the Bye-laws.  So long as something is saved, it  cannot\nbe  said  that the Court after receiving the  agreement\t and\nordering  that\tit  be\tfiled,\tbecomes\t completely  functus\nofficio.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">But  the  crux\tof the argument is that\t the  provisions  of\ntub.a.\t(4)  of\t s. 20 read with  sub-s.(1),  ibid.,  cannot\napply, and the Court, after filing the agreement, will have\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">1040</span>\nto do nothing more with it, and this shows that<a href=\"/doc/811701/\" id=\"a_69\"> s. 20</a> is not\napplicable.  This argument overlooks the fact that this is a\nstatutory  arbitration governed by its own rules,  and\tthat\nthe  powers and duties of the Court in sub-s. (4) of  s.  20\nare  of\t two  distinct kinds.  The  first  is  the  judicial\nfunction  to  consider\twhether\t the  arbitration  agreement\nshould\tbe filed in Court or not.  That may involve  dealing\nwith  objections  to  the  existence  and  validity  of\t the\nagreement  itself.   Once that is done, and  the  Court\t has\ndecided that the agreement must be filed, the first part  of\nits  powers and duties is over.\t It is significant  that  an\nappeal\tunder<a href=\"/doc/685723/\" id=\"a_70\"> s. 39</a> lies only against the decision  on\tthis\npart  of  sub-s.  (4).\tThen follows a\tministerial  act  of\nreference  to  arbitrator or arbitrators  appointed  by\t the\nparties.  That also was perfectly possible in this case,  if\nthe parties appointed the arbitrator or arbitrators.  If the\nparties\t do not agree, the Court may be required to  make  a\ndecision as to who should be selected as an arbitrator,\t and\nthat  may be a function either judicial, or  procedural,  or\neven  ministerial; but it is unnecessary to decide which  it\nis. In the present case, the parties by their agreement have\nplaced\tthe power of selecting an arbitrator or\t arbitrators\n(in  which we include also the umpire) in the hands  of\t the\nChairman of the Board of Directors of the East India  Cotton\nAssociation,  Ltd., and the Court can certainly perform\t the\nministerial act of sending the agreement to him to be  dealt\nwith  by him.  Once the agreement filed in Court is sent  to\nthe  Chairman, the Bye-laws lay down the procedure  for\t the\nChairman  and  the appointed arbitrator\t or  arbitrators  to\nfollow,\t and  that  procedure,\tif  inconsistent  with\t the\n<a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_71\">Arbitration  Act</a>,  prevails.  In our opinion,  there  is  no\nimpediment  to\taction\tbeing taken under<a href=\"/doc/638888/\" id=\"a_72\"> s.  20(4)</a>  of\t the\nArbitration Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_38\">We  may\t dispose of here a supplementary argument  that\t the\ndispute\t till  now  is\tabout the  legal  existence  of\t the\nagreement including the arbitration clause, and that this is\nnot  a\tdispute arising out of, or in relation to  a  cotton\ntransaction.  Reference was made to certain observations  in\nHeyman v. Darwins Ltd.(1). In\n(1)  [1942] A.C. 356.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_20\">1041</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_39\">our opinion, the words of the Bye-law &quot;arising out &#x27;of or in\nrelation  to contracts&quot; are sufficiently wide to  comprehend\nmatters,  which\t can legitimately arise under  s.  20.\t The\nargument is that, when a, party questions the very existence\nof  a contract, no dispute  can be said to arise out of\t it.\nWe think that this is not correct, and even if it were,\t the\nfurther\t words &quot; in relation to &quot; are sufficiently  wide  to\ncomprehend even such a case.  In our opinion, this  argument\nmust also fail.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_40\">It was contended lastly that the law applicable to the\tcase\nis  the\t lex  loci solutionis, that is to say,\tthe  law  of\nBritish\t East Africa.  Reference was made to a passage\tfrom\nPollock and Mulla&#x27;s Contract Act, Eighth Edn., p. 11,  where\nit is observed as follows:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">\t      &quot; In ordinary circumstances the proper law  of\n\t      a\t contract  (to use  Mr.\t Dicey&#x27;s  convenient\n\t      expression)  will\t be the law of\tthe  country\n\t      where  it\t is made.  But where a\tcontract  is\n\t      made in one country and to be performed wholly\n\t      or in part in another&#x27;, the proper law may  be\n\t      presumed\tto be the law, of the country  where\n\t      it is to be performed.&quot; (Auckland\t Corporation\n\t      v. Alliance Assurance Co.) (1)\n\t      The learned authors observe, on the same\tpage\n\t      further :\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">\t       &quot;But  these rules are only in the  nature  of\n\t      presumptions, and subject to the intention  of\n\t      the  parties,  whether expressly\tdeclared  or\n\t      inferred\tfrom  the terms and  nature  of\t the\n\t      contract and the circumstances of the case.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_41\">Reliance  was  also placed on Chitty&#x27;s Law of  Contract\t and\nRule  148,  sub-r.  (3),  Second  Presumption,\tin   Dicey&#x27;s\nConflict  of  Laws,  Seventh  Edn., p.\t738,  on  which\t the\nstatement of the law in Pollock and Mulla is based.\nWhether the proper law is the lex loci contracts or lex loci\nsolutionis  is\ta  matter  of  presumption;  but  there\t are\naccepted rules for determining which of them is\t applicable.\nWhere  the parties have expressed themselves, the  intention\nso  expressed overrides any presumption.  Where there is  no\nexpressed intention,\n(1) [1937] A.C. 587.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">1042</span>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_42\">then  the rule to apply is to infer the intention from\t the\nterms  and  nature  of the contract  and  from\tthe  general\ncircumstances  of the case.  In the present case,  two\tsuch\ncircumstances  are decisive.  The first is that the  parties\nhave  agreed that in case of dispute the Bombay\t High  Court\nwould  have jurisdiction, and an old legal proverb  says,  &quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">Qui  elicit  judicem eligit jus&quot; If Courts of  a  particular\ncountry\t are chosen, it is expected, unless there be  either\nexpressed intention or evidence, that they would apply their\nown  law  to the case.\tSee N. V. Kwick Who  Tang  v.  James\nFinlay\t&amp;  Co.\t(1).  The second circumstance  is  that\t the\narbitration  clause indicated an arbitration in\t India.\t  of\nsuch arbitration clauses in agreements, it has been said  on\nmore  than one occasion that they lead to an inference\tthat\nthe  parties  have adopted the law of the country  in  which\narbitration  is to be made.  See Hamlyn &amp; Co.  v.  Tallisker\nDistillery  (2),  and  Spurrier\t v.  La\t Cloche\t (3).\tThis\ninference,  it was said in the last case, can be drawn\teven\nin a case where the arbitration clause is void according  to\nthe law of the country where the contract is made and to  be\nperformed.  In our opinion, in this case, the  circumstances\nclearly\t establish that the proper law to be applied is\t the\nIndian Law.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">In  the\t result,  the appeal fails, and\t is  dismissed\twith\ncosts.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">Appeal dismissed.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">(1) [1927] A.C. 604.\t      (2) [1894] A.C. 204.\n(3) [1902] A.C. 446 (P.C.).\n</blockquote>\n\n\n","numcites":25,"numcitedby":58,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":876875,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"force majeure","formInput":"force%20majeure"},{"value":"consensus ad idem","formInput":"consensus%20ad%20idem"},{"value":"force majeure clause","formInput":"force%20majeure%20clause"},{"value":"void contracts","formInput":"void%20contracts"},{"value":"void agreements","formInput":"void%20agreements"},{"value":"lex loci","formInput":"lex%20loci"},{"value":"east india cotton","formInput":"east%20india%20cotton"},{"value":"appointment of arbitrator/","formInput":"appointment%20of%20arbitrator/"},{"value":"\" force majeure clause\"","formInput":"%22%20force%20majeure%20clause%22"},{"value":"arbitration clause","formInput":"arbitration%20clause"},{"value":"contract law","formInput":"contract%20law"},{"value":"\"consensus ad idem\"","formInput":"%22consensus%20ad%20idem%22"},{"value":"implied terms","formInput":"implied%20terms"},{"value":"ad idem","formInput":"ad%20idem"},{"value":"contract act","formInput":"contract%20act"},{"value":"indian arbitration act","formInput":"indian%20arbitration%20act"},{"value":"contract arbitration","formInput":"contract%20arbitration"},{"value":"\"arbitration\"   filter:   \"contract\" \"void-ab-initio\"","formInput":"%22arbitration%22%20%20%20filter%3A%20%20%20%22contract%22%20%22void-ab-initio%22"},{"value":"arbitration act","formInput":"arbitration%20act"},{"value":"laws of india","formInput":"laws%20of%20india"}],"cats":[{"value":"arbitration","formInput":"tag:arbitration"},{"value":"application-to-file-in-arbitration-agreement","formInput":"tag:application-to-file-in-arbitration-agreement"},{"value":"foreign-exchange","formInput":"tag:foreign-exchange"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
