India P. Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as\n&#x27;Environ&#x27; for short) for comprehensive operations and maintenance of\nsites in Rest of West Bengal (ROWB) circle maintained by VIOM\nNetworks (Principal). In connection to the award by Environ, the\nappellant in order to sub-contract the work, entered into a LOA dated\n20/08/2012 with OM Sai in terms of which it sub-contracted the work\nfor   comprehensive           operations         and      maintenance          of    Passive\nInfrastructure of sites in ROWB Circle maintained by VIOM Networks\n(Principal).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_24\">21.

Thereafter disputes arose between OM Sai and the appellant: (few\ndocumented ones out of all)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">      -   With regard to Statutory Liabilities, OM Sai had failed to discharge its liabilities\n          under the Employees Provident Fund and thus the appellant was requested to\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">                                                              I.T.A.

Om Sai raised its invoices for the period from August 2012 to\nApril and the appellant in settlement out of the said amount, based on\ninvoices, made total payments amounting to Rs.468.59 lakhs. It was\nthen learnt that certain excess payments were made by the appellant\non behalf of OM Sai and thus a total amount of Rs.1065.37 lakhs were\nrequired to be deducted from the total payments required to be made\nto OM Sai. The said amount also included the amount paid by VIOM\nNetworks towards the salary of Orion Security guards on the different\nsites on behalf of OM Sai.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_29\">24. To the above, OM Sai vide its email dated 17.07.2013 accepted\nthe payments required to be made to Orion Securities, which was by\nmistake made to OM Sai.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_30\">25. The appellant company vide repeated mails duly informed OM Sai\nabout the said proposed deductions and also of its liability towards the\nsub-contractors which was discharged by it. Emails were sent\nrequesting OM Sai to come forward and hold a meeting to settle the\naccounts between the parties. However, OM Sai failed to hold any\ndiscussions for settlement of accounts and in fact made false\nallegations on the appellant of acting unreasonably.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_12\">                                                      I.T.A.

Eventually, since OM Sai failed and neglected to settle the\naccount and to refund the excess amount towards deductions\nproposed by Environ, the appellant was constrained to address a final\nDemand Notice dated 01.04.2014 to OM Sai, calling upon it to make a\npayment of Rs.1,56,64,000/- towards the excess amount towards\ndeductions proposed by Environ.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_32\">27. However, OM Sai instead of making the payments towards the\nlegitimate demands raised by the appellant, sent a reply dated\n08.04.2014, making false and baseless averments about being entitled\nto claim an amount of Rs.9,30,10,552/- from the appellant. Thus the\nappellant in light of the above facts, filed on 28/08/2014, before the\nHon&#x27;ble High Court of Delhi, a Suit for recovery of an amount of\nRs.1,56,64,000/-along with interest thereon @ 18% per annum from\nthe date of the filing of the suit till realization of the said amount.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_33\">28. Pursuant to the above, OM Sai, with no desire to settle the\naccounts in fact filed a counter claim against the appellant before the\nHon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court for recovery of Rs.9.30 crores from the\nappellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_34\">29. Thus pursuant to all of the above sequence of events, the\nappellant finally considering and realizing that the matter was likely to\ngo through protracted litigation involving huge costs and harassment,\ntook the decision to write off the amount in its books.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_35\">30.

The Contract value of the work\nwas Rs.17,07,35,271/-.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_36\">31. A total Security Deposit for the Contract @ 5% of the accepted\nvalue   being   Rs.85,36,764/-    was   to   be    deposited.       However,\nRs.14,15,130/- being the Earnest Money Deposited with the offer was\nretained by KMR as part of the Security Deposit. Thus the balance\namount of Rs.71,21,634/- was to be paid by the appellant to KMR as a\n&#x27;Retention Security Deposit&#x27;. The said Retention Security Deposit of\nRs.71,21,634/- was to be deducted by KMR at the rate of 10% from\nthe bills raised on KMR as and when they were raised.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_37\">32. Another LOA dated 11/04/2011 was issued by KMR in\ncontinuation of the previous letter giving in details the description of\nworks, units, quantities, etc. Memorandum of Agreement dated\n03/06/2011 (&#x27;MOA&#x27; for short) was finally executed between the\nappellant and KMR. Immediately upon signing of the MOA, the\nappellant started mobilizing manpower and material and commenced\nactivities which included site visits. The appellant was however\nshocked to notice that when it&#x27;s personnel arrived at the respective\nlocations/sites, the said sites were not ready for the appellant to\nperform its obligations as per the MOA. As a result of the inaction on\nthe part of KMR, the appellant incurred substantial losses in the form\nof project overrun cost. The appellant had communicated this\nsituation to KMR vide letters dated 27.01.2014 and 11.02.2014. The\nappellant however did not receive a response from KMR, without which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                                                        I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020    14</span>\n\n\nit could not get necessary clearance to begin with the vital security\nequipment. The foregoing also resulted in failure of the appellant to\nutilize various listed materials because the KMR failed to release\ndispensation of overseas inspection under the provisions of the tender\ndocument, despite requests to this effect, being made by the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_38\">33. Surprisingly       however,      despite     the    considerable          delays\nattributable to KMR, the appellant was shocked to receive a SCN dated\n01/03/2014 from KMR in connection with the alleged delay of the\nappellant to complete the work within the extension. To this, a detailed\nReply dated 10/03/2014was sent by the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_39\">34. As the situation was reaching a deadlock, the appellant in all\nearnestness and to demonstrate its bona fides, as also with a view to\nrecover its dues (which were still not paid), engaged with KMR and\nbegan seeking release of due payments and to try and chart out a\ncourse   for   the   future    of    the   project.    KMR    had      paid      only\nRs.8,34,59,446/-     till     date   out    of   the    contract        value      of\nRs.17,07,35,271/-. The appellant had completed more than 90% of\nthe contracted work and raised a bill out of which Rs.10,24,09,303/-\nbecame receivable by the appellant. However Rs.8,34,59,446/- only,\nwas paid to the appellant out of the said receivable amount. Thus a\nsum of Rs.1,89,49,857/- along with interest was due and payable by\nKMR to the appellant. Despite repeated requests and reminders KMR\nhad failed and neglected to pay the aforesaid amount and in fact on\nthe contrary, the KMR had been writing letters to the appellant\nmentioning alleged defects and berating the appellant for doing\nunsatisfactory work.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                                                  I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020   15</span>\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_40\">35. Here, at this stage before closing the books of the accounts as on\n31/03/2015 for the A.Y. 2015-16, the appellant in view of the\ndiscussions made in the preceding paras, realized that in a situation\nwhere there were outstanding to the tune of more than Rupees 8\ncrores, the Retention Security Deposit of Rs.71,21,634/- was no longer\nrealizable at all. Thus on 27/03/2015 the management of the\nappellant company took the decision to treat the impugned sum as\nloss incidental to business and thus the appellant wrote off the said\nsum in its books. Meanwhile KMR after extending the period of\ncompletion of work till July 10, 2015 and while such period was yet to\nexpire, issued a Notice dated June 01, 2015 for termination of the\ncontract within 7 days&#x27; notice by claiming that the appellant was doing\nunsatisfactory work. The appellant too served a Legal Notice dated\n04/06/2015 on KMR for release of balance payments. Also vide its\nletter dated 08/06/2015 the appellant replied to the said notice and\nexplained the work done so far and the shortcomings caused due to\nthe non-performance on the part of KMR. KMR however paying no\nheed to such reply, issued another notice dated June 25, 2015 stating\nthat it is serving the 48 hours&#x27; notice on the appellant and thenceforth\nthe contract shall stand rescinded and that after the expiry of the 48\nhour period, the contract shall stand rescinded with immediate effect\nin terms with clause 62 of General Condition of Contract, the balance\nwork will be carried out without the participation of the appellant and\nthe Tender Security Deposit shall be forfeited and the Performance\nBank Guarantee shall be encashed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_41\">36. Thus in order to cover up its own failures and omissions, KMR\ninvoked the extreme measure of terminating the MOA which was\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_16\">                                                  I.T.A.

Inasmuch as disputes and differences arose between the parties\nas aforesaid, the appellant by it&#x27;s letter dated August 12, 2015 invoked\nthe Arbitration clause in its MOA. KMR having agreed to go ahead with\nthe arbitration, thereafter again a difference/dispute arose between\nKMR and the appellant regarding appointment of arbitrator for\nadjudication of the disputes relating to termination of the contract.\nThe matter travelled upto the Hon&#x27;ble Calcutta High Court where\ncertain directions were given by the Hon&#x27;ble Court to KMR for\nsuggesting/nominating names for arbitrators in a panel, out of which\nthe arbitrators can be selected.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_43\">38. However since KMR did not abide by the directions of the Hon&#x27;ble\nCalcutta High Court in nominating members for appointment of\narbitrator as directed by the Hon&#x27;ble Court, the appellant filed a case\nof contempt against KMR as it had committed contempt of the court\norders and the said case is pending.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_44\">39. Regarding other small Write off, of advances to parties GSID\nFurniture (Rs.83,190), Wage advance paid to two persons (Rs.8,000),\nSecurity Deposit Electricity (Rs.2,000), WCT - Haryana (Rs.1,440),\nEMD Haldia Dock (Rs.20,000), EMD Deposits (Rs.26,280), Inventory\nw/o (Rs.10,125) totaling to Rs.1,51,035/-, the appellant submitted\nthat the said advances were very much trade advances which on\nbecoming irrecoverable were accordingly written off by the it and\nenclosed copy of the ledger accounts of the said heads of Advances for\nthe Ld.

CIT(A)\nfurther went on to submit before him that the ld. A.O. had considered\nthe appellant&#x27;s case as that of write off of bad debt within the scope of\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/193068761/\" id=\"a_21\">section 36(1)(vii)</a> read with <a href=\"/doc/733738/\" id=\"a_22\">section 36(2)</a> of the Act as\nagainst write off, of business advances as business loss<a href=\"/doc/555776/\" id=\"a_23\"> u/s. 28</a> r.w.\n<a href=\"/doc/53397808/\" id=\"a_24\">section 37</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_46\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1628226\" id=\"span_18\">41. It was submitted that the ld. A.O. held that since the appellant\nwas not engaged in money lending business, it failed to prove that the\nadvances written off were taken into tax net in earlier years in terms of\n<a href=\"/doc/193068761/\" id=\"a_25\">section 36(1)(vii)</a> r.w. <a href=\"/doc/733738/\" id=\"a_26\">section 36(2)</a> of the Act and held that in view\nof the decision of the Apex Court in <a href=\"/doc/1628226/\" id=\"a_27\">Hasimara Industries Ltd. vs.\nCIT</a> (231 ITR 842), the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/193068761/\" id=\"a_28\">section 36(1)(vii)</a> r.w. <a href=\"/doc/733738/\" id=\"a_29\">section\n36(2)</a> of the Act stood attracted to the case of the appellant.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_47\">42. The appellant thus submitted before the ld. CIT(A) that in view of\nthe ld. A.O.&#x27;s action and on perusal of the assessment order it was\napparent that the ld. A.O. had not disbelieved the advances made by\nthe appellant to the parties aforesaid during the course of its business\nand entirely for the purpose of running its business and he had also\nnot disputed the fact of non-recovery of the said advances during the\nrelevant A.Y. and write off, of the same in the accounts of the\nappellant.   If that would be so, it was totally irrational when he\ndisallowed such advances, which had already become irrecoverable, as\nnot business loss and considered the same as bad debt falling within\nthe scope of provisions of <a href=\"/doc/193068761/\" id=\"a_30\">section 36(1)(vii)</a> r.w. <a href=\"/doc/733738/\" id=\"a_31\">section 36(2)</a> of the Act.\nThe appellant thus submitted before the ld. CIT(A) that the basis of\ndisallowance was therefore, a misunderstanding of facts and an\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_19\">                                                  I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020   18</span>\n\n\nerroneous application of the provisions of the said sections. The\nappellant also submitted before the ld. CIT(A) that the ld. AO on the\nbasic wrong presumption that the said write off of the business\nadvances fell under the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/193068761/\" id=\"a_32\">section 36(1)(vii)</a> r.w. <a href=\"/doc/733738/\" id=\"a_33\">section\n36(2)</a> of the Act had failed to appreciate that for giving a bona fide\nbusiness advance, that too as per agreement/purchase order/mutual\nconsent, as the case may be, it is not necessary for an assessee to be\nengaged in the business of money lending. The appellant thereafter\nsubmitted that thus it&#x27;s case is that for such advances, the same\ncannot be included in the income of earlier years, as is the case with\nbad debts coming within the scope of <a href=\"/doc/193068761/\" id=\"a_34\">section 36(1)(vii)</a> r.w. <a href=\"/doc/733738/\" id=\"a_35\">section\n36(2)</a> of the Act. The appellant further submitted before the ld. CIT(A)\nthat the ld. A.O. had not made any discussions in the Assessment\nOrder about the actual nature of claim of the appellant, being write off,\nof trade advances which is loss incidental to operation of business and\nwhich undoubtedly falls and is allowable within the meaning of <a href=\"/doc/555776/\" id=\"a_36\">section\n28</a> r.w. <a href=\"/doc/53397808/\" id=\"a_37\">section 37</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_48\">43. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1628226\" id=\"span_20\">In addition to the above submitted before the ld. CIT(A), the\nappellant further submitted that the ld. AO had relied on the Apex\nCourt&#x27;s decision in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1628226/\" id=\"a_38\">Hasimara Industries Ltd.</a> (supra) and\nhow the reliance placed by the ld. AO on <a href=\"/doc/1628226/\" id=\"a_39\">the said decision</a> in the\nbackground of the facts of this case are totally misplaced. The said\ndecision was thus distinguished.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_49\">44. Lastly, the appellant submitted before the ld. CIT(A) that <a href=\"/doc/555776/\" id=\"a_40\">section\n28</a> of the Income Tax Act, 1961 imposes a charge on the profits or\ngains of business or profession and the expression &#x27;Profits and gains of\nbusiness or profession&#x27; is to be understood in its ordinary commercial\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_21\">                                                   I.T.A.

What has to be\nbrought to tax is the net amount earned by carrying on a profession or\na business which necessarily requires deducting expenses and losses\nincurred in carrying on business or profession.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_50\">45. The appellant concluded that thus, what is relevant for claiming\nwrite off of advances is that (i) the said advance should not of capital\nin nature and (ii) the same should have been incurred wholly and\nexclusively for the purpose of the business and both of these\nconditions were undisputedly well existed, entitling it to adjust the loss\noccurred in relation to the operation of business with its income as per\nprovisions of <a href=\"/doc/555776/\" id=\"a_41\">section 28</a> r.w. <a href=\"/doc/53397808/\" id=\"a_42\">section 37</a> of the Act.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_51\">46.      As there were additional evidences submitted before the ld.\nCIT(A) while making the aforesaid submissions, which included several\nexchange of letters/correspondences, agreements etc. between the\nappellant and the parties (Govinda, Linton, OM Sai and KMR) and\nfor which Rule 46A of the Income Tax Rules, 1962 was pressed by the\nappellant, the ld. CIT(A) forwarded a copy of the paper book and the\nsubmission filed before him to the then A.O./DCIT for her examination\nof the same and comments on the same.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_52\">47.     The appellant thereafter received a notice from the ld.

CIT\n(A),purported to be written by the appellant to Govinda, was however\nissued on the letter head of Govinda instead of the letter head of the\nappellant and thus why the same should not be considered to be\nfabricated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_54\">49. The appellant in response to this query submitted and explained\nthat the same was very clearly a mistake on it&#x27;s part whereby the draft\nprepared by Govinda was inadvertently enclosed in the Paper book\nsubmitted by the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_55\">50. The appellant submitted that Govinda, being the Service Provider\nto the appellant, had procured a business proposal for the appellant\nwith AGC Network Ltd. for sub-contract of work of Hindustan\npetroleum Corporation Ltd. on back to back basis and the proposal for\nthe same was given by Govinda to the appellant vide the letter dated\n15/12/2013 which had been placed at page 103 of the Paper book.\nThe appellant had immediately given the go ahead for the said\nproposal verbally. However Govinda wanted a go ahead in writing and\nthus it prepared a draft of the said letter to be issued by the appellant,\nin its own letter head and under its signature. The go ahead having\nalready been given verbally, the appellant did not issue a formal\nwritten letter. However the said draft so prepared by Govinda remained\nin the possession of the appellant and during the course of the hearing\nbefore the ld.

(GOVINDA) -ADVANCE WRITTEN\n   OFF: RS.3,92,00,000/-:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_22\">Herein firstly the appellant would like to submit that for confirming the disallowance of appellant&#x27;s\nclaim of write off, of advance given to Govinda the ld. CIT (A) made various allegations against the\nappellant. Before going into the specific allegations of the ld.

In this connection Govinda was a Private\nLimited Company actively engaged in the business of providing Business Development services to\nits various clients in PAN India.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_77\">Govinda thus approached the appellant company on 10/08/2010 with a proposal to engage them as a\nService Provider who, based on their expertise in the said field and also based on their strong\nconnections in the various Government Departments could help the appellant company, being an\nemerging company, gain various businesses.

Copy of the said Agreement dated\n02/05/2011 is enclosed at pages 85-91 of the paper book for Your Honours&#x27; perusal.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_79\">(ii)    As per the Agreement, the appellant company being the &#x27;Client&#x27; appointed Govinda as the\n&#x27;Service Provider&#x27; wherein the Client was to pay as Service Fee, 10% of the business value that the\nService Provider would generate for the Client.

The\npurpose of advancing such money to the service provider and the conditions thereof, as reduced in\nwriting in the said agreement, are reproduced below:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">&quot;III.

No.1615/DEL/2020     27</span>\n\n\n\n In the interim, on the request of Service Provider, the Client has agreed to pay Rs.4,15,00,000\n(Rupees Four Crore Fifteen Lakh only) as a non-interest bearing and non-adjustable refundable\nadvance/deposit.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">It is expressly agreed between the parties that amount would be refunded forthwith in case the\nService Provider fails to develop business for the client as committed hereinabove by the end of the\nyear.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\">In any case, the advance/deposit are refundable latest by March 31, 2013.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_81\">With regard to Breach of Contract or any differences and claims, it was laid out in the Agreement\nvide Clause XIII that &quot;in case of any dispute or differences or claims or demands whatsoever\nbetween the First party and the second party which do not get resolved amicably, the matter shall be\nreferred to Arbitration before a Sole Arbitrator to be mutually appointed by both the parties.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_82\">In terms of the Agreement the first instalment of Rs.4,15,00,000/- was paid on 03/05/2011 to the\nService provider as Advance against the said services to be provided. A further sum of Rs.2,00,000/-\nwas paid to Govinda on 14/05/2013 but it was on account of a certain payment made merely on\nbehalf of the Service provider. It was not on account of Advance against the Agreement entered into\nby the Appellant with the Service Provider.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_83\">(iii) Now, however during the years, business was gradually obtained by the appellant company\nand there was continuous dispute with Govinda as to whether the same was on account of the efforts\nof Govinda or due to efforts of the appellant company. Also there were disputes regarding sums to be\npaid to Govinda. The disputes arising between the appellant company and Govinda are listed out as\nunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">   -   Re: Business developments with Kolkata Metro Railways (KMR) - F.Y. 2011-12\n\nPursuant to initial discussions and proposals to the appellant company, Govinda on 02/09/2010 vide\na letter (Copy enclosed at page 92 of the paper book) informed the appellant company of a Tender\nby Kolkata Metro in connection with providing security arrangements in the form of CCTV, etc at\nthe Stations, with the suggestion that the appellant company should participate in the same and try to\nsecure the said business which would be of a big amount.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">The appellant Company on 25/02/2011, pursuant to its effective and competitive bidding, managed\nto secure the Contract with KMR and Letter of Acceptance by KMR to the appellant was issued on\n25/02/2011(copy enclosed at pages 273 to 277 of the paper book).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">However, pursuant to the above business being acquired by the appellant company, Govinda,\nclaiming that the said business was secured due to their efforts and sent an immediate congratulatory\nmessage on 26/02/2011 vide a letter(copy enclosed at page 93 of the paper book).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">In the meanwhile on 11/04/2011, the above Letter of Acceptance was formalized vide a written\ncontract dated 11/04/2011 with KMR for providing electronic security systems. The said Agreement\nwith Kolkata Metro was entered into for a contract value of 17 crores. The Contract was secured\nafter very tight bidding and due to the whole team effort of the appellant company.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_30\">                                                                      I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020     28</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_33\">Again pursuant to the above, Govinda, claiming its credit of the said contract, acknowledging the\nreceipt of the advance of Rs.4,15,00,000/- sent a letter dated 05/05/2011 enclosing therewith an\nInvoice of Rs.1.7 crores being 10% of the project value. Copy of the said letter dated 05/05/2011 is\nenclosed at page 94-94aof the paper book.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_34\">The appellant company on receipt of the said Invoice, vide its letter dated 30/06/2011 totally denied\nthe claim of Govinda of having any role to play in securing the business of KMR. The appellant\nfurther reminded Govinda to fulfil it&#x27;s commitment with regard to the generation of business to the\ntune of Rs. 50 crores. Copy of the said letter dated 30/06/2011 is enclosed at page 95 of the paper\nbook.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_35\">Thus it is seen that from the very beginning of the contract itself, dispute was created with Govinda.\nIt should also be noted that Govinda from the very inception of the Contract with KMR was in\nconstant touch with the appellant claiming that the said businesses were all acquired by the appellant\ndue to the efforts of Govinda which was denied by the appellant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">-   Re: Business developments with M/s Environ Energy Corpn.

Copy of the said\nletters are enclosed at pages 96 and 97 of the paper book.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">Thus, pursuant to the above, Contract dated 14/08/2012 was executed with Environ for\ncomprehensive operations and maintenance of sites in Rest of West Bengal (ROWB) circle\nmaintained by VIOM Networks (Principal)amounting to Rs.18.00 Cr.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">Immediate to the above, Govinda immediately raised its Invoice on the appellant vide its letter dated\n14/08/2012. Copy enclosed at page 98-98a of the paper book.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_39\">Acknowledging the above Invoice, the appellant company vide its letter dated 16/08/2012 informed\nGovinda to take the necessary steps to ensure that Environ does not impose unnecessary and\nfrivolous deductions on them. Copy of the same is enclosed at page 99 of the paper book.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_40\">However, without taking any steps to ensure that Environ does not impose frivolous deductions on\nthe appellant, Govinda, simply in a hurry to extract money from the appellant, raised its Invoice vide\nletter dated 15/04/2014 on the appellant for the said business with Environ. Copy of the same is\nenclosed at page 100 of the paper book.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_41\">The appellant noting that no efforts whatsoever were put into by Govinda to avoid the deductions\nand that Environ had imposed considerable deductions of Rs.5.86 cr on them, the appellant informed\nGovinda vide it&#x27;s letter dated 02/08/2014 that since due efforts and diligence was not displayed by\nGovinda, the invoice raised was not justified and thus they denied the payment against them. Copy of\nthe same is enclosed at page 101 of the paper book.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_42\">Thus it is seen that in case of business developed with Environ, admittedly due to the efforts of\nGovinda, again disputes arose on account of the unjust and unreasonable deductions imposed by\nEnviron on the appellant company which left the business with Environ with no profitability.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_31\">                                                                       I.T.A.

(copy of\ninvoice enclosed at page 105- 105a of the paper book).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_86\">Again it was the stand of the appellant that the said business was not secured through Govinda and\nthus nothing was payable to them. Correspondence to this effect vide letter dated 20/01/2014 is\nenclosed at page 106 of the paper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_87\">Thus again it is seen that disputes were raised with Govinda Infra.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_88\">-   Re: Business developments with Wal-mart India (referred to as &#x27;Wal-mart&#x27; for short)- F.Y.\n    2014-15\n\nRegarding Wal-mart India it was informed by Govinda vide its letter dated 10/04/2014 that it\nproposed to enter into discussions with the said company for securing its business for the appellant\nwhich would work out to Rs.8 crores in value.

Copy of the said letter is enclosed at page 108\nof the paper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_90\">Thus it is again seen that the appellant company regarding it&#x27;s business with Wal-mart also entered\ninto disputes with Govinda.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_91\">(iv)   Thus, over a period of time, in view of the above disputes with regard to business\ndevelopment services of Govinda and being observed that no substantial, profit earning business was\nreceived by the appellant by virtue of the efforts of Govinda, the appellant made several\ncorrespondences, with this debtor party during the span of the four years, for pursuance of business\nwith them, extension of the contract, seeking of refund of the advance and ultimately the recovery of\nthe advance.

The said payment in no way points out to the fact that the party was paying. Infact the action\nof the Party in refunding only a sum of Rs.23,00,000/- out of outstanding amounts to the tune of\nRs.4,15,00,000/- reinstates that the Party was unable and unwilling to refund the whole amount.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_95\">(vi)   Coming back to the issue, it is stated that the numerous facts of dispute between the appellant\nand Govinda on account of the various businesses claimed to have been secured by Govinda and the\nvarious letters of claims filed by Govinda, made the appellant company weary of the recovery of the\nadvance given to Govinda. The appellant was also not sure of its desire to enter into protracted\nlengthy legal recovery methods which would involve huge amounts of legal fees and also unfruitful\ninvestment of time and effort.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_96\">Thus the appellant company, pursuant to the recovery of only Rs.23,00,000/-, after total non refund\nof the advance even after the expiry of the agreed period of time limit being March 31, 2013 and\nbeyond, desirous thus of not pursuing the balance refund and of not carrying forward the unrealizable\nand dead amounts of advance, decided to write off the same in its books before the yearend 2014-15.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_97\">Accordingly on 27/03/2015, the balance advance of Rs.3,92,00,000/- lying unpaid in it&#x27;s books of\naccount was written off, by the appellant and resultantly the appellant incurred a loss of\nRs.3,92,00,000/-in carrying out the operation of the business.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_98\">The said action of the appellant shall be evident from the copy of the ledger accounts of the said\nparty in the books of the appellant for the F.Y.s.2011-12, 2012-13, 2013-14 &amp; 2014-15 placed at\npages 109-112 of the paper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_99\">Herein it is pertinent to mention that this advance of Rs.4,15,00,000/- given to Govinda by the\nappellant on 03/05/2011 was the subject matter of assessment for A.Y.s. 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-\n15 wherein the efficacy of the advance given to Govinda was never questioned in the previous A.Y.s.\nNow when the said advance was written off in the assessment year under consideration, it being\nquestioned on the grounds of commercial expediency thereby a ploy by the Department for\ndisallowing the appellant&#x27;s claim.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_100\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"176458221\" id=\"span_33\">Also, it is a matter which is in the domain of a business man where considering the commercial\nexpediency of his business, an advance is given in course of his business.

CIT(A) and also the Reply filed before the ld. CIT(A) in response to the ld.\nDCIT&#x27;s comments concerning Govinda in the impugned Remand Report, the ld. CIT(A) without\npaying heed to any of such submissions, explanations and evidences filed before him at the appellate\nstage, finally passed the Appellate Order on 28.08.2020, making the following allegations against\nthe appellant, thus confirming the ld. A.O.&#x27;s disallowance of the claim of Write off, of advances\ngiven to Govinda.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_122\">The appellant&#x27;s Reply to each of the allegations are also submitted hereunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_46\">1.      CIT(A)&#x27;s Allegation:\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_39\">                                                                       I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020      36</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_47\">That in the Remand Report, the Ld. A.O. mentioned that Govinda did not comply with the notices\nissued.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_48\">Appellant&#x27;s Reply:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_49\">The appellant in this regard would like to submit (as also submitted in response to the Remand\nReport) that the ld. CIT(A), completely without any basis stated on the basis of the ld. AO&#x27;s\nobservation in the Remand Report that Govinda did not reply to the notice issued<a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_55\"> u/s 133(6)</a> of the\nAct.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_50\">The appellant submits that the last transaction between the appellant and Govinda was on 22/10/2014\nwhen, after lots of insistence and follow ups, a refund of Rs.23,00,000/- was received from them.\nPursuant to that, on realizing the futility of recovery of the balances, on 27/03/2015 the balance lying\nin the account of Govinda Infra was written off as loss incidental to business (evidencing the same,\nGovinda&#x27;s ledger account from 01.04.2011 to 31.03.2015 is enclosed at pages 109-112 of the paper\nbook). The appellant further submits that since then, it had no business transactions with Govinda\nand no communication whatsoever has been there between Govinda and the appellant. Lastly it is\nsubmitted by the appellant in this regard that Govinda is now a defunct company and even all efforts\nby the appellant to contact them has failed.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_123\">Thus the notices<a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_56\"> u/s 133(6)</a> of the Act issued by the ld. DCIT/AO at the end of the year 2018 had\nseemingly gone non replied to by Govinda.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_124\">The appellant in this regard would like to add by submitting that it is not understood it as to how the\n&#x27;no reply&#x27; from Govinda can determine the genuineness of its transactions with the appellant which\nwere dated four years back. In such a scenario, after a gap of more than four years and that too with\nzero communication with the said party of the appellant, no adverse inference can be drawn against\nthe appellant for any absence of reply from Govinda.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_125\">In view of the above the impugned alleged premise of the ld. CIT(A) for upholding the ld. A.O.&#x27;s\ndisallowance of the claim of Write off, of advances given to Govinda has no basis to stand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_126\">2.     CIT(A)&#x27;s Allegation:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_51\">The ld. CIT(A) alleged that the ld. AO in the Remand Report mentioned that in the letter dated\n20.12.2013 purported to be written by the appellant to its service provider Govinda, it was noticed\nthat the letter head used for this correspondence belongs to Govinda. The AO has mentioned that the\nappellant has admitted the mistake by stating that Govinda prepared a draft letter to be issued by the\nappellant, in its own letter head and inadvertently got submitted before the ld. CIT(A).\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_127\">Appellant&#x27;s Reply:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_52\">In this regard the appellant would like to reiterate that Govinda, being the Service Provider to the\nappellant, had procured business proposal for the appellant with AGC Network Ltd. (AGC) for sub-\ncontract of work of Hindustan petroleum Corporation Ltd. (HPCL) on back to back basis and the\nproposal for the same was given by Govinda to the appellant vide the letter dated 15/12/2013 which\nwas placed at page 103 of the Paper book, submitted earlier before the ld. CIT(A) and is further now\nsubmitted before Your Honours at page 103 of the paper book.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                                                       I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020      37</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_53\">Pursuant to the same, the appellant had immediately given the go ahead for the said proposal\nverbally. However Govinda wanting a go ahead in writing, thus prepared a draft of the said letter to\nbe issued by the appellant, however in its own letter head and under its signature. The go ahead\nhaving already been given verbally, the appellant did not issue a formal written letter. The said draft\nso prepared by Govinda however, remained in the possession of the appellant and during the course\nof the hearing before the ld. CIT(A) inadvertently got submitted before the ld. CIT(A) as such.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_54\">The appellant further in light of the above submits that the same was very clearly a mistake on the\npart of the appellant whereby the draft that was prepared by Govinda was inadvertently enclosed in\nthe paper book submitted by the appellant. It was therefore humbly submitted by the appellant both\nbefore the ld. AO and the ld. CIT(A) to acknowledge the inadvertent action on the part of the\nappellant and to excuse the same.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_55\">The appellant thereafter submits that however, the ld. CIT(A) has completely ignored the humble and\nhonest admission of mistake of the appellant and based on this alleged premise upheld the Ld. AO&#x27;s\ndisallowance of advance written off.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_56\">The appellant also submits in this regard that it is pertinent to mention that a perusal of the paper\nbook submitted before the Ld. CIT(A) would reveal that the appellant, with regard to its transactions\nwith Govinda had enclosed documents supporting the same, from pages 83 to 112. The same\ncontained various letters exchanged between the appellant and Govinda with regard to numerous\ndiscussions and transactions. All the said letters and documents have been all examined in full details\nby the ld. AO and the ld. CIT(A) and all of them have been found to be genuine. The appellant\nsubmits that out of the 21 (to be specific) letters exchanged between the appellant and Govinda, only\none letter has been found to be incorrect which has also been in full humility accepted as a mistake.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_57\">In these circumstances, it is grossly unfair of the ld. CIT(A) to arrive at the conclusion of confirming\nthe ld. AO&#x27;s disallowance of the claim of Write off, of advances given to Govinda, based on a sole\nletter.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_128\">3. CIT(A)&#x27;s Allegation:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_58\">The ld. CIT(A) relying on the ld. AO&#x27;s Remand Report has alleged that there is no evidence of\ncorrespondence between the parties as the appellant has only mentioned that the acknowledgment\nletters of various dates have been hand delivered and the said letter needs to be accepted as proof of\ndelivery.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">Appellant&#x27;s Reply:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_60\">In this regard the appellant would like to submit that it has it&#x27;s Branch office in Kolkata at 216, AJC\nBose Road, 2nd Floor, Flat No. 2C, Kolkata- 17. The appellant having secured the Contract with\nMetro Railway Department, Kolkata (KMR) had set up its Branch office in Kolkata since the year\n2011. In this connection the &#x27;Certificate of Enlistment&#x27; of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation in the\nname of the appellant at the Kolkata office is enclosed at pages 556 to 558 of the paper book.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_61\">Thus the appellant having its Branch office in Kolkata and since Govinda was based out of Kolkata,\nsimply for convenience sake, all the communications received and sent by the appellant to Govinda\nwere all hand delivered at the Branch office in Kolkata. The Receipt Acknowledgement of the\nletters of the appellant, as stamped by Govinda, are all enclosed at pages 559 to 567 of the paper\nbook.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                                                                       I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020      38</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_62\">In view of the above, therefore the ld. CIT(A) alleging that there is no evidence of correspondence\nbetween the parties is factually incorrect. Further acknowledgment letters of various dates, hand\ndelivered between the Govinda and the appellant are sufficient and valid proof of correspondence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_63\">Accordingly, the abovementioned alleged premise of the ld. CIT(A) for arriving at the conclusion of\nconfirming the ld. A.O.&#x27;s disallowance of the claim of Write off, of advances given to Govinda, does\nnot hold good and has no basis to stand.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_129\">4.   That with regard to the ld. A.O. stating the following in the Remand Report, the ld. CIT(A)\n     further made severalallegations:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_64\">•    The justification given by the appellant regarding letter dated 20.12.2013 (purported to be\n     written by it to its service provider Govinda, using the letter head of Govinda for this\n     correspondence) has no substance in it as the content of the said letter was a mere consent to\n     proceed with the order procurement. Therefore it is beyond comprehension why one party will\n     guide and advise the other party in drafting a simple two line letter and that too under its\n     signature and letter head.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_65\">•    That appellant&#x27;s contention regarding Kolkata office is not verifiable as from the perusal of\n     appellant&#x27;s records and its ITR/Form 3CD/Ledger accounts submitted during assessment\n     proceedings it is revealed that there is no branch office at Kolkata. The letter head of the\n     appellant showed no branch office with Kolkata address and that the letters from these two\n     parties were addressed to the appellant company at its Delhi address. Not a single letter was\n     found addressed to the appellant&#x27;s Kolkata branch office, however, during the course of\n     appellate proceedings before the ld. CIT(A), the documents submitted by the appellant showed\n     that it had obtained registration certificate at 216A A.J.C. Bose Road, 2nd Floor, Kolkata -\n     700017 but it was not mentioned in any correspondence with the parties as well as in the return\n     of income.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_66\">•    That if the contention of the appellant, that whether there is any branch office at Kolkata or not,\n     is not verifiable, then the question of correspondence with Kolkata office does not arise and\n     thus, the justification given by the appellant lacks conviction. Also it appears strange that the\n     appellant company&#x27;s Delhi based officials dealing with AO were not aware of the\n     correspondence at Kolkata office especially when major financial disputes with multiple parties\n     were supposedly going on for years.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_67\">On the basis of the aforesaid observations of the ld. DCIT in the Remand Report, the ld. CIT(A) thus\nalleged that:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_68\">4. (i) CIT(A)&#x27;s Allegation:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_69\">That the dealing with the entity (Govinda) shows opaqueness and ambiguities. The appellant had\nadvanced various sums of money from time to time without entering into legally recognized\ncorrespondence. The confusion regarding letterhead (as mentioned in the remand report) is also an\nimportant pointer to the ambiguity in the nature of the transaction. Theory of prudence would suggest\nthat no prudent business man will advance such sums without well laid down outcome agreements\nand during remand or appellate proceedings the appellant has not come up with any cogent reasons\nas to why the entity was chosen with respect to its proven track record.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                                                                       I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020      39</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_70\">Appellant&#x27;s Reply:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_71\">In this regard the appellant would like to reiterate that it had entered into an Agreement dated\n02/05/2011 with Govinda for the purpose of developing its Security Business in PAN India wherein\nthe appellant company being the &#x27;Client&#x27; appointed Govinda as the &#x27;Service Provider&#x27; and the Client\nwas to pay as Service Fee, 10% of the business value that the Service Provider would generate for\nthe Client. It was also represented by the Service Provider that it would generate business of at least\nRs.50,00,00,000/- per year in F.Y.s. 2011-12 and 2012-13. Invoice for the business development\nservices would be raised by the Service provider on realization of fees by the Client from the\nbusiness generated by the Service Provider. Copy of the Agreement dated 02/05/2011 is enclosed at\npages 85 to 91 of the paper book.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_72\">Meanwhile on the request of the Service provider, i.e. Govinda, a sum of Rs.4,15,00,000/-was\ngiven/advanced to it during the course of business as a refundable business advance/deposit. The\npurpose of advancing such money to the service provider and the conditions thereof, as reduced in\nwriting in the said agreement, are (at the cost of repetition) reproduced below:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_73\">       &quot;III. COMMERCIALS\n       ...............\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_74\">       Refundable Advance/Deposit\n\n       In the interim, on the request of Service Provider, the Client has agreed to pay\n       Rs.4,15,00,000 (Rupees Four Crore Fifteen Lakh only) as a non-interest bearing and non-\n       adjustable refundable advance/deposit.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_75\">       It is expressly agreed between the parties that amount would be refunded forthwith in case\n       the Service Provider fails to develop business for the client as committed hereinabove by\n       the end of the year.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_76\">       In any case, the advance/deposit are refundable latest by March 31, 2013.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_77\">With regard to Breach of Contract or any differences and claims, it was laid out in the Agreement\nvide Clause XIII that &quot;in case of any dispute or differences or claims or demands whatsoever\nbetween the First party and the second party which do not get resolved amicably, the matter shall be\nreferred to Arbitration before a Sole Arbitrator to be mutually appointed by both the parties.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_78\">Thus in terms of the Agreement dated 02/05/2011, the first instalment of Rs.4,15,00,000/- was paid\non 03/05/2011 to the Service provider as Advance against the said service to be provided.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_79\">From the above it is crystal clear that it is not the appellant&#x27;s case that it had advanced various sums\nof money to Govinda from time to time without entering into legally recognized correspondence.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_80\">Further the ld. CIT(A) stated that the appellant&#x27;s contention regarding Kolkata office is not verifiable\nas from the perusal of appellant&#x27;s records and its ITR/Form 3CD/Ledger accounts submitted it is\nrevealed that there is no branch office at Kolkata. The letter head of the Appellant showed no branch\noffice with Kolkata address and that the letters from these two parties were addressed to the appellant\ncompany at its Delhi address. Not a single letter was found addressed to the appellant&#x27;s Kolkata\nbranch office, however, during the course of appellate proceedings before the Ld. CIT(A), the\ndocuments submitted by the appellant showed that it had obtained registration certificate at 216A\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_43\">                                                                       I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020      40</span>\n\n\nA.J.C. Bose Road, 2nd Floor, Kolkata - 700017 but it was not mentioned in any correspondence\nwith the parties as well as in the return of income.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_81\">Stating the above the Ld. CIT(A) has alleged that confusion regarding letterhead is also an\nimportant pointer to the ambiguity in the nature of the transaction.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_82\">In this connection that appellant would like to submit that there is no confusion regarding letterhead\n(as alleged by the ld. CIT(A)). The appellant submits that in the above paras it has clearly explained\nand established that it did have a Branch (Work) office in Kolkata at 216, AJC Bose Road, 2nd\nFloor, Flat No. 2C, Kolkata- 17. The &quot;Certificate of Enlistment&quot; of the Kolkata Municipal\nCorporation in the name of the appellant at the Kolkata office was also duly enclosed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_83\">However the ld. CIT(A) with an absolute prejudiced and predetermined mind has tried to deny the\nexistence of the Registered Branch/Work Office of the appellant since the Branch office was not\nmentioned in the Returns or in the letterhead of the appellant. The appellant in this connection\nreiterates that nowhere is it a requirement of law that the Branch office of any Company has to be\nstated in the letter head of the Company.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_84\">Besides the above, the appellant would like to submit that the ld. CIT(A) pointing out that the letters\nfrom Govinda were all addressed to the appellant at its Delhi address was without appreciating that\nthe Kolkata Branch office was in the nature of a Work station, set up for easy coordination in the\nMetro railways, Kolkata project. The appellant submits that the contract between the appellant and\nGovinda had nothing to do with the Kolkata Work office. Govinda&#x27;s dealing was with the appellant\ncompany in Delhi, however since it was based out of Kolkata, simply for convenience sake, the\nletters were received by the appellant in its Kolkata office.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_85\">Thus this allegation of the ld. CIT(A) that confusion regarding letterhead is also an important pointer\nto the ambiguity in the nature of the transaction is indeed a very casual statement/allegation which\ncannot hold any weightage at all and thus has no basis to hold ground.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_86\">In addition to the above the appellant would further like to submit that the ld. CIT(A) has alleged that\ntheory of prudence would suggest that no prudent business man will advance such sums without well\nlaid down outcome agreements and during remand or appellate proceedings the appellant has not\ncome up with any cogent reasons as to why the entity was chosen with respect to its proven track\nrecord.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_87\">The appellant in this regard would like to reiterate that it had advanced Rs.4,15,00,000/- to Govinda\non the basis of a well laid down Agreement dated 02/05/2011 (copy enclosed at pages 85 to 91 of\nthe paper book) as submitted above, and the said advance was given during the course of business as\na refundable business advance/deposit. The purpose of advancing such money to the Govinda and\nthe conditions thereof, have been reduced in writing in the said agreement in &#x27;Chapter III:\nCommercials&#x27; (which have been reproduced in detail above). Therein it was also mentioned and\nagreed to, by both Govinda and the appellant that if Govinda failed to develop business for the\nappellant, the advance given to it would be refunded by it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_88\">Thus it is not the appellant&#x27;s case that it advanced money to Govinda without well laid down\noutcome agreements as alleged by the ld. CIT(A).\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_89\">Further it was also not the case that the appellant did not come up with cogent reasons as to why\nGovinda was chosen with respect to its proven track record.

(iii) CIT(A)&#x27;s Allegation:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">That it is important to analyze whether payments made to the entity also measures upto the principle\nof commercial expediency. Various payments were made to Govinda for procurement of business\nand payment amounting to Rs.4,15,00,000/- was made on 03/05/2011. Further Govinda was engaged\nfor procuring business for the appellant from various concerns like Metro Railways, Kolkata,\nEnviron Energy Corporation India Pvt. Ltd., AGC Network Ltd. and Walmart India, out of which\ntwo concerns are in the nature of PSUs and it is not known how the appellant could take advantage\nof the tendering process by engaging an entity like Govinda. Most of the public procurements done\nby such companies are transparent and undertaken through an open competitive bidding process.\nSimilarly Walmart India is a reputed MNC and therefore explanation offered by appellant is of\ndoubtful vintage.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">Moreover during the course of remand proceedings the AO brought out inconsistencies in the\napproach of the appellant which includes issues of clarifications on behalf of Govinda and non\ndelivery of letter<a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_69\"> u/s 133(6)</a> of the Act at the designated address. Under the provisions of the Act, the\nonus of proving that expenditure has wholly and exclusively related to the business of the appellant\nand that the same was incurred on account of commercial expediency rests solely on the appellant\nitself. It is the responsibility of the appellant to advance evidence which would render the\nevidence/documents submitted acceptable from the prospective of tax proceedings.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_101\">Appellant&#x27;s Reply:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_102\">In this regard the appellant would firstly like to submit that the procurement of business of\ncompanies in the public sector or of the private limited companies involves several procedures and\nsteps which begins with good professional connections with such concerns (both private limited\ncompanies and companies in the public sector). Service providers (in this case Govinda) usually have\ngood connections with private limited companies and companies in the public sector who bring out\ntenders from time to time for purchase of various goods and services. The service providers are\nusually informed of such tenders even before they are published and brought out and thus they are\nhired by sellers (like in this case the appellant) for informing them about such tenders and\npreparation in advance for bidding for such tenders.\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">                                                                       I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020     43</span>\n\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_103\">The service providers further develop connections between the buyer and the seller (in this case the\nappellant) once a tender is out for bidding which facilitates the chances of winning a tender for the\nprospective bidder/seller (in this case the appellant). Besides, the procurement policies of companies\ngo for an overhaul many a times which is studied and understood in detail by the service providers\nfor an efficient bidding and such knowledge is then shared by the service provider with the ultimate\nseller (in this case the appellant) for an efficient bidding.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_104\">Thus the service providers act as a bridge between the buyer and the seller and Govinda in this case\nwas hired by the appellant for a similar role of procuring business, developing connections with the\nbuyer and passing on of first hand information regarding the tender, for an efficient participation in\nthe bidding of the tender.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_105\">Further the appellant was earlier only involved in providing manpower security systems and it was\nventuring into providing electronic security systems for the first time when Govinda was hired as a\nService Provider in helping it source more business and tender information in this specific field.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_106\">Therefore the ld. CIT(A)&#x27;s allegation in this regard that it is not known how the appellant could take\nadvantage of the tendering process by engaging an entity like Govinda (when out of concerns like\nMetro Railways, Kolkata, Environ Energy Corporation India Pvt. Ltd., AGC Network Ltd. and\nWalmart India, two concerns were in the nature of PSUs and Walmart was a MNC), stands\nexplained from the role of Govinda as a Service Provider, explained above.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_107\">Further there is no such requirement of law that for participating in tenders of PSUs or MNCs, the\nhelp of Service Providers cannot be taken or are not required. It is quite a practice in the service\nindustry to hire Service Providers for successful bidding of tenders as explained above.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_108\">Having submitted the above with regard to the ld. CIT(A)&#x27;s further allegations it is submitted by the\nappellant that there is no inconsistency in the appellant&#x27;s approach regarding issues of clarifications\non behalf of Govinda and non delivery of letter<a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_70\"> u/s 133(6)</a> of the Act at the designated address.\nFirstly it is submitted herein that the ld. CIT(A) has not specified which issues were clarified by the\nappellant on behalf of Govinda which led to inconsistency, hence the said allegation cannot be met\ncompletely.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_109\">As far as the ld. CIT(A)&#x27;s allegation regarding the appellant&#x27;s approach being inconsistent is\nconcerned with regard to non delivery of letter<a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_71\"> u/s 133(6)</a> of the Act at the designated address, it is\nsubmitted (at the cost of repetition) that the last transaction between the appellant and Govinda Infra\nwas on 22/10/2014 when, after lots of insistence and follow ups, a refund of Rs.23,00,000/- was\nreceived from them. Pursuant to that, on realizing the futility of recovery of the balances, on\n27/03/2015 the balance lying in the account of Govinda Infra was written off as loss incidental to\nbusiness. The appellant further submits that since then, it had no business transactions with Govinda\nand no communication whatsoever has been there between Govinda and the appellant. Lastly it is\nsubmitted by the appellant in this regard that Govinda is now a defunct company and even all efforts\nby the appellant to contact them has failed.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_110\">Thus the notices<a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_72\"> u/s 133(6)</a> of the Act issued by the ld. AO at the end of the year 2018 had gone non\nreplied to, by Govinda.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_111\">Therefore the appellant submits that the &#x27;no reply&#x27; to notices<a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_73\"> u/s 133(6)</a> of the Act by Govinda\nshould not lead to the appellant&#x27;s approach being inconsistent and thereafter determine the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                                                                     I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020     44</span>\n\n\ngenuineness of its transactions with Govinda which were dated four years back. In such a scenario,\nafter a gap of more than four years and that too with zero communication with the said party of the\nappellant, no adverse inference can be drawn against the appellant for any absence of reply from\nGovinda.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_112\">Lastly with regard to the Ld. AO&#x27;s observation that the onus of proving that expenditure has wholly\nand exclusively related to the business of the appellant and that the same was incurred on account of\ncommercial expediency rests solely in the appellant itself and the appellant is to advance evidence\nwhich would render the evidence/documents submitted acceptable from the prospective of tax\nproceedings, it is submitted that -\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_113\">the submissions made above, before Your Honours&#x27; along with the documentary evidences under the\nheading &#x27;Background&#x27;, amply establish that the advance given to Govinda being written off and\nclaimed as loss incidental to business was wholly and exclusively related to the business of the\nappellant and that the same was incurred on account of commercial expediency. The said\nsubmissions made above may be referred to for the same.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_114\">Herein it is pertinent to mention that this advance of Rs.4,15,00,000/- given to Govinda by the\nappellant on 03/05/2011 was the subject matter of assessment for A.Y.s. 2012-13, 2013-14 and 2014-\n15 wherein the efficacy of the advance given to Govinda was never questioned in the previous A.Y.s.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_135\">Now when the said advance was written off in the assessment year under consideration, it being\nquestioned on the grounds of commercial expediency thereby a ploy by the Department for\ndisallowing the appellant&#x27;s claim.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_136\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"176458221\" id=\"span_50\">Also, it is a matter which is in the domain of a business man where considering the commercial\nexpediency of his business, an advance is given in course of his business. The same cannot be\nquestioned by the Department.The Hon&#x27;ble S.C. in its recent decision has held that commercial\nexpediency has to be adjudged from the point of view of the assessee and not the Revenue in the\ncase of <a href=\"/doc/176458221/\" id=\"a_74\">Shiv Raj Gupta vs. CIT</a> reported in (2020) 425 ITR 420, where the Hon&#x27;ble Apex Court\nheld that commercial expediency has to be adjudged from the point of view of the assessee and that\nthe Income-tax Department cannot enter into the thicket of reasonableness of amounts paid by the\nassessee.(para 15, page 12 of the Order). Following are the relevant extracts of the decision:</span>\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_115\">&quot;This finding flies in the face of settled law. A catena of judgments has held that commercial\nexpediency has to be adjudged from the point of view of the Assessee and that the Income Tax\nDepartment cannot enter into the thicket of reasonableness of amounts paid by the Assessee.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_137\">In view of the above the impugned alleged premises of the ld.

Moreover no tax has been deducted on the amounts paid to the\nentity, which shows that the payment was not above-board.

Further the complete evidences\nplaced by the appellant before the ld.

Once nothing has been proved against the assessee with aid of any\ndirect material, then nothing can be implicated against the assessee. In light of the same as in the\nappellant&#x27;s case nothing has been proved against it with aid of any direct material, the theory of\n&quot;preponderance of probability&#x27; cannot be applied in the appellant&#x27;s case.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_155\">In view of the above the ld. CIT(A)&#x27;s alleged premise for upholding the ld. A.O.&#x27;s disallowance of\nthe claim of Write off, of advances given to Govinda has no basis to stand.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_156\">Lastly, the appellant would further like to submit that the ld. CIT(A) has alleged that the appellant\nhas failed to prove the genuineness and commercial expediency of the expenditure incurred. No\nprudent reasonable man would advance such a substantial amount for procuring orders from other\nentities. It raises legitimate presumption about the legitimacy of the payment made.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_157\">In this regard the appellant would like to submit that it has sufficiently proved the genuineness and\ncommercial expediency of the expenditure incurred in the above paras in this submission. Reiterating\nfurther it is submitted that over a period of time, in view of the disputes with regard to business\ndevelopment services of Govinda Infra and being observed that no substantial profit earning business\nwas received by the appellant by virtue of the efforts of Govinda Infra, the appellant made several\ncorrespondences with Govinda for pursuance of business with them, extension of the contract,\nseeking of refund of the advance and ultimately the recovery of the advance. Copies of the letters in\nthe said connection dated 31/08/2011, dated 11/10/2011, 01/04/2013 and 30/06/2014 are all\nenclosed at pages 108a to 108d of the paper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_158\">Finally pursuant to the letter of the appellant dated 30/06/2014 asking for refund, the appellant was\nable to recover only a sum of Rs.23,00,000/- on 22/10/2014 (Rs.25,00,000/- was refunded by\nGovinda Infra on 22/10/2014, which included the Rs.2,00,000/- paid on behalf of it by the appellant).\nCopy of the letter dated 22/10/2014 refunding the said amount is enclosed at page 108e of the\npaper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_159\">The above sequence of events clearly prove and substantiate that inspite of all correspondences and\nrecovery proceedings, the party (Govinda) was unwilling to refund the entire amount and after much\ndeliberations a meagre sum of Rs.23 lakhs was paid by them. However the said payment in no way\npoints out to the fact that the party was paying. In fact the action of the Party in refunding only a sum\nof Rs.23,00,000/- out of outstanding amounts to the tune of Rs.4,15,00,000/- reinstates that the Party\nwas unable and unwilling to refund the whole amount.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_66\">                                                                       I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020      48</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_160\">Thus all these facts of dispute between the appellant and Govinda Infra on account of the various\nbusinesses claimed to have been secured by Govinda and the various letters of claims filed by\nGovinda, made the appellant weary of the recovery of the advance given to Govinda Infra. The\nappellant was also not sure of its desire to enter into protracted lengthy legal recovery methods which\nwould involve huge amounts of legal fees and also unfruitful investment of time and effort.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_161\">Hence the appellant, pursuant to the recovery of only Rs.23,00,000/- (after total non refund of the\nadvance even after the expiry of the agreed period of time limit being March 31, 2013 and beyond),\ndesirous thus of not pursuing the balance refund and of not carrying forward the unrealizable and\ndead amounts of advance, decided to write off the same in its books before the year end 2014-15.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_162\">Accordingly on 27/03/2015, the balance advance of Rs.3,92,00,000/- lying unpaid in its books of\naccount was written off by the appellant and resultantly the appellant incurred a loss of\nRs.3,92,00,000/- in carrying out the operation of the business. The said action of the appellant shall\nbe evident from the copy of the ledger accounts of the said party in the books of the appellant for\nF.Ys 2012-13, 2013-14 &amp; 2014-15 placed at pages 109-112 of the paper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_163\">Thus the above sufficiently proves the genuineness and commercial expediency of the expenditure\nincurred by the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_164\">As far as the ld. CIT(A)&#x27;s allegation is concerned that no prudent reasonable man would advance\nsuch a substantial amount for procuring orders from other entities and it raises legitimate\npresumptions about the legitimacy of the payment made, it is submitted by the appellant that-\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_165\">the advance of Rs.4,15,00,000/- paid by the appellant to Govinda was for business purposes only and\nwere reasonable considering the volume of the business (i.e. worth Rs.50,00,00,000/-) that Govinda\nwas supposed to source. The appellant further submits that as a company running its business, the\nappellant is the best judge of its affairs and knows the best way to run its business and incur expenses\nin the process accordingly. The ld. CIT(A) cannot step into the appellant&#x27;s shoes or sit in his\narmchair and decide about the expenditure and the reasonableness, commercial expediency and\njustifiability of such expenditure. It all has to be judged from the point of view of the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_166\">Reliance in this regard is placed in the following judicial pronouncements:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_119\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1712737\" id=\"span_67\">The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1712737/\" id=\"a_91\">S.A.

Further advance\nfor procurement of other materials as per the Order was requested and the same was also advanced\nby the appellant in good faith. The appellant company was concerned about the proper execution of\nthe Order and the same was expressed to Linton vide letters dated 05/12/2011 and 15/12/2011.

It was also informed to Linton that based on the assurances extended by\nthem to the appellant about the execution of the PO, the termination of the Order was not\nsought.(Copy of the letter dated 25/06/2012 is enclosed at page 171 of the paper book).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_182\">Also, as per the request for further advance by Linton, the appellant company again in full and good\nfaith made all advance payments totalling to Rs.1,11,50,000/- which was duly acknowledged by\nLinton vide its letter dated 04/04/2013.

Thereafter advance payments totalling to Rs.1,17,50,000/- was paid by the year end of 2013.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_183\">It is here relevant to mention that the appellant was using its buffer stock of uniforms which were\nwearing out due to wear and tear. The appellant was thus in need for the Order to go through and\nthus the appellant, based on the continuous assurances of Linton, in complete good faith and hope\nthat the Order would be executed, even if with delay, kept making the said balance payments.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_184\">(vii) Entire advances having been made, the appellant company in the month of January 2014 was\nmade aware that Linton had not even initiated the purchase of the new fabric after being informed in\nSeptember 2011 of the change of the fabric.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_185\">It was seen by the appellant that 4 years had passed and there was no work yet done on the said\norder. Thus, finally realizing the futility of the Order, the appellant company immediately vide its\nletter dated 15/01/2014 informed Linton of the termination of the Order.

A.O.&#x27;s disallowance of the claim of Write off, of advances given to Linton.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_205\">The appellant&#x27;s Reply to each of the allegations are also submitted hereunder:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_139\">1. CIT(A)&#x27;s Allegation:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_140\">That both Linton and Govinda shared the same address and the payments to both proceeded on\nsimilar trajectory.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_141\">Appellant&#x27;s Reply:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_142\">In this regard the appellant would like to submit that the ld. CIT(A), like the ld. A.O. in the Remand\nReport, has for no reason alleged that Govinda and Linton share the same address which is a matter\nof record all placed well, both before the ld. CIT(A) and the ld. AO. Also if two parties, with whom\nthe appellant has had transactions, share a common address, how the said fact affects the\nrecoverability of the due sums from each of them or even the genuineness of the transactions with\nthem is not understood.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_143\">Further the payments to Govinda and Linton do not proceed on the same trajectory as alleged by the\nld. CIT(A). This is because Govinda was paid an advance money of Rs.4,15,00,000/- as a Service\nProvider for sourcing business relating to providing of security services worth Rs.50,00,00,000/-, i.e.\n8.3% of the worth of business to be sourced was paid as advance to Govinda. As for Linton, 100%\nadvance was given by the appellant and that too for making/procuring of uniform and shoes for\nsecurity guards/care takers. Thus it is amply clear that the payments to both Govinda and Linton did\nnot proceed on similar trajectory and both the parties having the same address cannot lead to drawing\nof an adverse conclusion against the appellant.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_206\">In view of the above, the ld. CIT(A)&#x27;s alleged premise for confirming the ld. A.O.&#x27;s disallowance of\nthe claim of Write off, of advances given to Linton has no basis to stand.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_82\">                                                                       I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020     58</span>\n\n\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_207\">2. CIT(A)&#x27;s Allegation:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_144\">That 100% advance was paid on 10.05.2010 amounting to Rs.1,17,50,000/- and as per ld. A.O.&#x27;s\nRemand Report, the payment was made to an entity which did not possess the necessary\ninfrastructure to execute the order and did not have proven capacity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_145\">Appellant&#x27;s Reply:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_146\">In this regard it is submitted by the appellant that the Order having been placed with Linton and\nevidenced by the Purchase Order, the payments having been made by the appellant vide the regular\nbanking channels, all evidenced by supporting communications, the commercial intelligence of the\nappellant is being unnecessarily questioned by the ld. CIT(A) by alleging that payment was made to\nan entity which did not possess the necessary infrastructure to execute the order and did not have\nproven capacity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_147\">Further infrastructure for the purpose of supplying uniforms and shoes to the appellant involved\nhiring/appointing tailors and karigars specifically skilled to stitch and prepare the uniforms to the\nspecific measurement of every individual security guard/care taker of the appellant to be deployed at\nthe various sites, in a certain set pattern (as required by the appellant), with the appellant&#x27;s\nmonogram and name of the security guard embossed on it.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_148\">Thus upon receipt of the order for supply of uniforms and shoes for security guards/care takers from\nthe appellant, Linton had to set up infrastructure which was particular Order specific(specifications\nas mentioned above) and for which Linton had to incur huge expenditure which was funded out of\nthe advance given by the appellant. The same shall be clear from the letter dated 21.09.2010 of\nLinton to the appellant (copy placed at page 158 of the paper book). This however by no stretch of\nimagination implies that Linton had no required infrastructure or proven capacity to execute the\norder. Infact Linton had the potential and connections to immediately hire and appoint skilled tailors\nand karigars for preparing the uniforms as per the specifications of the appellant, upon receipt of the\norder and that further corroborates the capacity of Linton to meet the order.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_149\">In view of the above the ld. CIT(A)&#x27;s allegation that the payment was made to an entity which did\nnot possess the necessary infrastructure to execute the order and did not have proven capacity is\nbaseless and cannot hold ground.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_208\">3. CIT(A)&#x27;s Allegation:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_150\">The ld. CIT(A) alleged that Linton is an entity with which the appellant had only &#x27;one time&#x27;\ncommercial transaction and it is not at all probable that a prudent businessman would make a\npayment of Rs.1,17,50,000/- as a one off transaction to one entity, which did not have any prior\nexperience in manufacturing products which the appellant required. The entire transaction of\nadvancing of an amount to Linton therefore cannot be taken on face value.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_151\">That the Remand proceedings also clearly brought out the anomalies which needs to be accepted\nagainst the appellant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_152\">Appellant&#x27;s Reply:\n</blockquote><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_83\">                                                                      I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020     59</span>\n\n\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_153\">In this regard the appellant would like to reiterate that that the appellant issued Purchase Order\ndated 11.05.2010 (PO) to Linton for supply of Uniforms and shoes for Care Takers/Security Guards\n@ 2 uniform plus 1 shoes pair for each care taker. (Copy of the Purchase Order with the details of\nsecurity guards are placed at pages 113-152 of the paper book).The Order was for 5250 pieces of\nComplete Uniform comprising of Shirt, Trouser, Belt and Cap at Rs.2,000/- per set. Also 2625 pair\nof shoes at the rate of Rs.480/- per pair was ordered. Thus a total Purchase Order (after discount) of\nRs.1,17,50,000/- was drawn up. A complete list of such caretakers including the Site/Tower Number,\nthe Site/Tower Name and the Caretaker&#x27;s name who manned the said site whose uniforms were to be\nmade were also provided with the Purchase Order (PO) and the same can be seen at pages 114-152\nof the paper book.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_154\">The Purchase Order, laying down the Terms and Conditions of the Purchase/Supply, laid out that\nagainst such order of Purchase, 100% advance would be given in as much the uniforms required\nimmediate investment in the materials and also the uniforms being tailor made specific to each\ncaretaker, the payment was all to be made in advance.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_155\">Infact it is an industry norm that for stitching of uniforms/shoes etc which are specific to the\nmeasurement of every individual and if not accepted/used goes bad/useless leading to a loss as the\nsame set cannot be used for another individual (being specific to the measurement of the concerned\nindividual), hence 100% advance is paid for such orders. Thus as a one off transaction, 100%\nadvance amounting to Rs.1,17,50,000/- was paid to Linton by the appellant in a &#x27;one time&#x27;\ncommercial transaction.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_156\">In view of the above, the ld. CIT(A)&#x27;s allegation that it is not at all probable that a prudent\nbusinessman would make a payment of Rs.1,17,50,000/- as a one off transaction to one entity, which\ndid not have any prior experience in manufacturing products which the appellant required is\ncompletely baseless and has no legs to stand.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_157\">Moreover the ld. CIT(A) cannot step into the appellant&#x27;s shoes or sit in his armchair and decide\nabout the expenditure and the reasonableness, commercial expediency and justifiability of such\nexpenditure. It all has to be judged from the point of view of the appellant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_158\">Reliance in this regard is placed in the following judicial pronouncements:\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_159\">   <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1712737\" id=\"span_84\">•   The Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court of India in the case of <a href=\"/doc/1712737/\" id=\"a_102\">S.A.

CIT(A) on his own whims\nand fancies made a bald allegation that Linton did not have any prior experience in manufacturing\nproducts which the appellant required without however considering the material facts in this regard\nand what constituted infrastructure for the purpose of the appellant&#x27;s orders and further without\nbringing any material/information across which would substantiate his allegations. Hence the same\ncannot be relied upon to draw any adverse inference against the appellant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_161\">The ld. CIT(A) further alleged that the Remand proceedings also clearly brought out anomalies\nwhich needs to be accepted against the appellant. In this regard it is firstly submitted that all the\nanomalies brought out in the Remand Report has been duly responded to by the appellant vide reply\ndated 21.12.2018 (copy enclosed at pages 584 to 593 of the paper book) and have been further\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_87\">                                                                       I.T.A.

CIT(A) has alleged that since the appellant had filed suit for recovery before the Hon&#x27;ble\nDelhi High Court which is pending, deduction of the &#x27;advances written off&#x27; claimed by the\nappellant, without waiting for outcome of the legal proceedings is premature as the transaction is still\nthe subject matter of litigation.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_183\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1845894\" id=\"span_107\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1940207\" id=\"span_108\">The ld. CIT(A) has further held that in respect of damages for breach of contract, it is established law\nthat such damages arise only when it is either accepted by the other party or decreed by the\ncompetent court. He also held that an award by the arbitrator may stand on a same footing like the\ncourt award. In either case when the award is not accepted but is the subject matter of further appeal,\na part payment even if it is received could not be treated as income. For this purpose the Ld. CIT(A)\nplaced reliance on the judgments of <a href=\"/doc/1940207/\" id=\"a_121\">Paragon Constructions (I) Pvt. Ltd. vs. CIT</a> [2005] 274 ITR 413\n(Delhi) following the decision of the Supreme Court in <a href=\"/doc/1845894/\" id=\"a_122\">CIT vs. Hindustan Housing and Land\nDevelopment Trust Ltd.</a> [1986] 161 ITR 524 (SC). Having stated this the Ld. CIT(A) further stated\nthat the same argument can be extended to issues relating to expenditure as well. Thus the Ld.\nCIT(A) held that during the pendency of a judicial dispute, the amount can be treated as neither\ndetermined nor crystallized and hence the same cannot be allowed as a business expenditure.</span></span>\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_258\">Appellant&#x27;s Reply:\n</p>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_184\">In this regard the appellant would like to submit that since in light of the disputes with OM Sai\nregarding recovery of advance, the appellant filed before the Hon&#x27;ble High Court of\nDelhion28/08/2014 a Suit for recovery.Thereafter theld. CIT(A)&#x27;s allegation that deduction of the\n&#x27;advances written off&#x27; claimed by the appellant, without waiting for outcome of such legal\nproceedings is premature as the transaction is still the subject matter of litigation, is grossly\nincorrect.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_185\">There is no such law which prohibits writing off, of non recoverable advances and claiming\ndeduction of the same if the transaction is a subject matter of litigation or is pending adjudication\nbefore a Court. This is so when on the other hand OM Sai, with no desire to settle the accounts in\nfact filed a counter claim against the appellant before the Hon&#x27;ble Delhi High Court for recovery\nof Rs.9.30 crores from the appellant thus leading the matter going through protracted litigation\ninvolving huge costs and harassment, with probably no fruitful outcome which eventually lead to\nsurety regarding complete non recovery of the advances.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_186\">However on the eventuality of such disputes getting resolved in future and passing of an appropriate\norder by the Court wherein the advances in dispute and which are written off by the appellant are\nrefunded to the appellant or a part of it is refunded, the same shall be offered to tax by the appellant\nas &#x27;income&#x27; in its ROI in that concerned Assessment Year.

There were disputes about implementation of\nthe contract in time and the default committed by NDMC. Ultimately the matter was referred to the\narbitrator and the arbitrator by his award dated 27th Aug, 1987, held that NDMC shall pay to\nParagon Constructions a sum of Rs.33,45,669.24 with simple interest as specified in the\naward.Paragon Constructions moved the High Court praying that the arbitrator be directed to file the\noriginal award for making the award a rule of the Court. Against the award, objections were filed by\nNDMC and in those proceedings NDMC deposited the amount in the Court without prejudice to its\nobjections to the award in order to avoid further interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_260\">By an order dated 23rd March, 1988, the High Court directed that the amount of Rs.49,61,856.64 be\npaid to the Paragon Constructions subject to its furnishing a bank guarantee of a nationalised bank\nwithin one month for restitution and to the effect that if NDMC succeeds, Paragon Constructions\nshall refund the amount to NDMC along with interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_261\">The amount was thereafter withdrawn by Paragon on furnishing a bank guarantee and the same was\ndeposited in fixed deposit account with the bank. The AO held that the interest accrued on the\namount so deposited is a taxable income for the year under consideration, i.e. A.Y. 1992-93. Before\nappeal was preferred before the Tribunal, the High Court decided the issue in favour of Paragon\nConstructions during the financial year that ended on 31st March, 1995.

By these communications the appellant clarified its stand in regard to the accessories of\nMulti Zone DFMD. Copy of the said letters are enclosed at pages 290-294of the paper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_286\">The appellant however was still to receive a response from KMR, without which it could not get\nnecessary clearance to begin with the vital security equipment.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_287\">The foregoing also resulted in failure of the appellant to utilize various listed materials because the\nKMR failed to release dispensation of overseas inspection under the provisions of the tender\ndocument, despite requests to this effect, being made by the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_288\">(x)     Surprisingly however, despite the considerable delays attributable to KMR, the appellant was\nshocked to receive a SCN dated 01/03/2014 from KMR in connection with the alleged delay of the\nappellant to complete the work within the extension. Copy of the same is enclosed at pages 295-299\nof the paper book\n\nA detailed Reply dated 10/03/2014was sent by the appellant, copy of which is enclosed at pages 300-\n331 of the paper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_289\">(xi)    As the situation was reaching a deadlock, the appellant in all earnestness and to demonstrate\nits bona fides, as also with a view to recover its dues (which were still not paid), engaged with KMR\nand began seeking release of due payments and to try and chart a course for the future of the project.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_290\">KMR had paid only Rs.8,34,59,446/- till date out of the contract value of Rs.17,07,35,271/-. The\nappellant had completed more than 90% of the contracted work and raised a bill out of which\nRs.10,24,09,303/- became receivable by the appellant. However Rs.8,34,59,446/- only, was paid to\nthe appellant out of the said receivable amount. Thus a sum of Rs.1,89,49,857/- along with interest\nwas due and payable by KMR to the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_291\">(xii) Despite repeated requests and reminders KMR had failed and neglected to pay the aforesaid\namount and in fact on the contrary, the KMR had been writing letters to the appellant mentioning\nalleged defects and berating the appellant for doing unsatisfactory work.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_292\">(xiii) Here, at this stage before closing the books of accounts as on 31/03/2015 for the A.Y. 2015-\n16, the appellant in view of the discussions made in the preceding paras, realized that in a situation\nwhere there were outstanding to the tune of more than Rs. 8 crores, the Retention Security Deposit\nof Rs.71,21,634/- was no longer realizable at all. Thus on 27/03/2015 the management of the\nappellant company took the decision to treat the impugned sum as loss incidental to business and\nthus the appellant company wrote off the said sum in its books.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_293\">The Security Deposit Ledger Account namely &quot;Security Deposit at Kol Metro&quot; for the period\n01/04/2011 to 31/03/2015 is enclosed at pages 505 to 509 of the paper book. A perusal of the same\nwill reveal that as and when the Sales Bill was raised on KMR, a 10% Security Deposit, as per the\nLetter of Acceptance, was deducted and retained as Retention Security Deposit by KMR.\n</p><span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_131\">                                                                        I.T.A.

Copy of the same is enclosed at pages 332-333 of the\npaper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_295\">(xv) The appellant too served a legal Notice dated 04/06/2015 on KMR for release of balance\npayments. Copy of the same is enclosed at pages 334-338 of the P/B.\n\nAlso the appellant, vide its letter dated 08/06/2015 replied to the said notice dated 01.06.2015 and\nexplained the work done so far and the shortcomings caused due to the non-performance on the part\nof KMR. Copy enclosed at pages 339-343 of the paper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_296\">(xvi) KMR however paid no heed to such reply and issued another notice dated June 25, 2015\nstating that it is serving the 48 hours&#x27; notice on the appellant and thenceforth the contract shall stand\nrescinded.

The letter dated 24/07/2015 addressed by KMR to the Yes Bank for\nrelease of the BG is enclosed at pages 348-350 of the P/B.\n\nLetters from KMR addressed to the appellant dated 21/07/2015, 29/07/2015 and 25/08/2015\nintimated the appellant of taking over possession of the uninstalled materials and the CCTV systems.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_298\">Copy of the said letters are enclosed at pages 351-357 of the paper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_299\">(xix) In light of the abovementioned delays, it is clear that KMR was evading payment and had\nterminated the contract without referring the point of dispute to arbitration and invoking Performance\nBG by encashing it.

Copy enclosed at pages 359-\n364 of the paper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_306\">(xxii) KMR however did not dispute the arbitration agreement between the parties and had agreed\nto go ahead with the nominations as per the Agreement and also chose the three nominees being the\nRailway Officers. (vide letter dated 09/09/2015, copy enclosed at page 365 of the paper book). The\nappellant was further asked to complete it&#x27;s nomination.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_307\">Various further communications vide letters dated 08/04/2016 and 26/04/2016were exchanged\nbetween the parties.Copies enclosed at pages 366 -367 of the paper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_308\">(xxiii) However, it is pertinent to state here that the conditions stipulated for nomination of\nArbitrator in the arbitration clause of the MOA was prima facie prejudicial to the interests of the\nappellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_309\">It was the contention of the appellant that the arbitration clause provided that in one way or the other\nonly Railway officials could be appointed as Arbitrator. Needless to state, that the Arbitrator(s), if\nappointed as per the arbitration clause of MOA, might not have been impartial while adjudicating the\ndispute. It was very apparent from the arbitration clause that KMR had been misusing its superior\nposition and had attempted to enforce conditions which were adverse to the appellant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_310\">(xx) Next, in view of the neglect and/or wrongful refusal of KMR to appoint an arbitrator in terms\nof the said agreement, the agreed procedure between the parties failed and an Application was made\nby them before the Hon&#x27;ble Calcutta High Court<a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_141\"> u/s 11</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act,\n1996, for appointment of an arbitrator.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_311\">(xxi) The said Application wa s disposed off, by the Hon High Court vide Order dated\n29/06/2016 whereby the Hon&#x27;ble High Court directed KMR to take a decision for nomination in\nterms of Clause 64(1)(i) of the contract within a period of 120 days.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_312\">(xxii) KMR inspite of the said Order failed and neglected to comply with the directions of the High\nCourt&#x27;s Order dated 29/06/2016.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_313\">Several communications dated 14/10/2016, 15/11/2016 and 15/12/2016 to this effect were\nexchanged. Copies of the letters are enclosed at pages 368-373 of the paper book.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_314\">(xxiii) Thus again Application was made by the appellant<a href=\"/doc/1841764/\" id=\"a_142\"> u/s 11</a> of the Arbitration and Conciliation\nAct, 1996, (AP 52 of 2017) pursuant to which, by an Order dated 15th February, 2017the Hon&#x27;ble\nCalcutta High Court directed KMR to furnish the names of three persons for nomination of an\narbitrator to be made by the contractor &quot;keeping in mind the fifth schedule to the Act&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_315\">(xxiv) On 24/02/2017, KMR forwarded to the appellant three names. According to the arbitration\nclause the contractor had to choose two out of which the railways would appoint one as the\narbitrator.(copy enclosed at page 374 of the P/B)\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_134\">                                                                       I.T.A.

The Hon&#x27;ble Court had also directed in the said Order that the said panel may contain\nnames of serving or retired officers of other organizations, thereby, implying that the names to be\nforwarded to the appellant must exclude those persons who belong to the Respondent/KMR.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_317\">(xxvii) Pursuant to the said Order KMR forwarded a panel of 31 names consisting of retired and\nserving officers along with a cryptic and acronymic description of their designation along with the\nletter dated 14/08/2017(copy enclosed at pages 382-383 of the paper book).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_318\">(xxviii)Subsequently, the appellant sent another letter dated 10/11/2017(copy enclosed at page 384\nof the paper book )calling upon KMR to choose two names from the list of 31 names provided along\nwith the letter dated August 14, 2017, fully disregarding the fact that the Hon&#x27;ble High Court had\ndirected the panel to consist of persons of different backgrounds and professional avocations and\nattainments from other organizations. It is clearly stated that the list of Arbitrators provided by KMR\nwas not in conformity with the Order dated July 19, 2017 passed by the Hon&#x27;ble Court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_319\">(xxix) However despite further continued exchanges of letters, KMR acted in wilful, deliberate and\ncontumacious violation of the said order dated July 19, 2017 and continued to defy the directions of\nthis Hon&#x27;ble Court as contained in the said order.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_320\">(xxx) Thus in view of the above it was the contention of the appellant that KMR had committed\ncontempt of the orders of this Hon&#x27;ble Court and was accordingly liable to be dealt with in\naccordance with law for the aforesaid contumacious acts and conduct.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_321\">(xxxi) Thus the appellant-company ultimately filed on 30/04/2018 vide C.C.No.21 of 2018\n(A.P.No.374 of 2017) a Contempt Case before the Hon&#x27;ble Calcutta High Court. A copy of the\nsaid Contempt Suit is enclosed at pages 385-504 of the paper book. It was stated therein that the\nContemner (KMR) should be held guilty of Contempt of Court and be suitably punished by\nimposition of fine and/or by imprisonment in civil prison for an appropriate term as this Hon&#x27;ble\nCourt may deem fit and proper.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_322\">(xxxii) The abovementioned detailed facts were also submitted by the appellant before the ld.\nCIT(A).\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_323\">REMAND REPORT AND ISSUES RAISED:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_219\">(xxxiii)              Pursuant to the above, the ld.

KMR having agreed to go ahead with the\narbitration, thereafter, a difference/dispute arose between KMR and the appellant regarding\nappointment of arbitrator for adjudication of the disputes in the matter of termination of the\ncontract. The matter travelled up to the Hon&#x27;ble Calcutta High Court where certain directions\nwere given by the Hon&#x27;ble Court to KMR for suggesting/nominating names for arbitrators in a\npanel, out of which the arbitrators can be selected.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_231\">However since KMR did not abide by the directions of the Hon&#x27;ble Calcutta High Courtin\nnominating members for appointment of arbitrator as directed by the Hon&#x27;ble Court, the\nappellant filed a case of contempt against KMR as it had committed contempt of the court\norders and the said case is pending before the Hon&#x27;ble Calcutta High Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_232\">Now the write off, of the retention security deposit by the appellant was made within 31st\nMarch, 2015.Whereas the above dispute regarding appointment of arbitrator and thereafter filing\nof case of contempt for not abiding by the Hon&#x27;ble High Court&#x27;s Orders regarding appointment\nof arbitrator, all related to and arose on KMR terminating its contract with the appellant on a 48\nhours&#x27; notice and that too in June-July, 2015 i.e. after the appellant had written off the retention\nsecurity deposit at the time of closing of its books for F.Y. 2014-15.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_233\">Therefore the appellant&#x27;s write off, of the retention security deposit at the time of closing of its\nbooks as on 31st March, 2015 as the same became non recoverable along with pending\nbill/receipts of more than Rs. 8 crores, has no connection or link with the case of contempt\npending before the Hon&#x27;ble Calcutta High Court which was filed much later and pursuant to\nKMR not following the Hon&#x27;ble High Court&#x27;s directions regarding appointment of arbitrator for\nadjudication KMR&#x27;s sudden termination of the Contract with the appellant.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_234\">Hence the said matter being sub judice cannot have an impact on the allowability of the\nappellant&#x27;s claim of write off of advance (in the form of retention security deposit) and the said\nallowability is not dependent on the outcome of the case of contempt pending before the\nHon&#x27;ble Calcutta High Court.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_235\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1845894\" id=\"span_138\">It is further submitted in this regard that the ld.

The Land\nAcquisition Officer awarded a sum of Rs.24,97,249/- as compensation payable to Hindustan\nHousing who, however was not satisfied with the amount of compensation, and preferred\nan appeal before the Arbitrator, 24 Parganas, Calcutta. The Arbitrator made an award\ndated July 29, 1955 whereby he fixed the amount of compensation at Rs.30,10,873/- on\naccount of the permanent acquisition of the land, thus enhancing the original amount of\ncompensation by Rs.5,13,624/- on which he directed interest at 5 per cent per annum from\nJanuary 8, 1953, the date of acquisition, to the date of payment.

Therefore there was no way the retention\nsecurity deposit of Rs.71,21,635/- would be paid by Metro railways, Kolkata.

The Assessing Officer, as a matter of fact,\ndid not record his dissatisfaction with the correctness of the claim made by the assesssee.\nTherefore, the judgment cited by Mr. Bhowmick has not manner of application. We have\nconsidered the rival submissions and are of the opinion that on the basis of the judgment cited by\nMr. Bhowmick, it cannot be said that the appeal raises any question or substantial question of\nlaw.

We have heard the rival submissions and perused the relevant\nfinding given in the impugned orders and the material referred to\nbefore us. Though, we have incorporated the exhaustive submissions\nwhich are borne out from the records and also discussion made by the\nAssessing Officer in the remand report and Ld. CIT(A) in his order with\na view to have a clear picture of the issues involved which are purely\nbased on facts and evidences. First of all, even though assessee might\nhave claimed as a bad debt in the profit and loss, but before the\nAssessing Officer as well as ld. CIT(A) the assessee claimed that it was\nactually a business loss in the normal course of carrying on business,\nas the advances were given to aforementioned parties during the\ncourse of business in the earlier years for the reasons mentioned\nabove as business advance and then it was duly explained the\ncircumstances in which these advances could not be recovered either\ndue to dispute or for different various reasons as discussed above, and\ntherefore, it was claimed as business loss while computing the profit\nand loss account for the year under consideration.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_342\">71.   From the perusal of the discussion made above with regard to\ndisallowance of claim advance written off which has been confirmed by\nthe ld. CIT(A), it is seen that, firstly in the case of Govinda\nInfraproperty Pvt. Ltd. (Govinda) in whose account the assessee has\nwritten off the advance of Rs.3,92,00,000/-, there was an agreement\nbetween the assessee and the said party for the purpose of developing\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">                                                I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020   89</span>\n\n\nthe assessee&#x27;s security business across the India wherein the assessee\nwas required to pay service fee of 10% of the business value that\nservice provider would generate for the assessee. In the agreement\nitself it was agreed by the service provider that it would generate\nbusiness of Rs. 50 crore per year in the Financial Years 2011-12 and\n2012-13 each and the invoice for the business development service\nwould be raised by the service provider on realization of fees by the\nclient from the business generated by the service provider. However,\nthe service provider has requested for interim sum of Rs.4,15,00,000/-\nduring the course of business as a refundable business advance\n/deposits, but thereafter there arose a dispute with the said party as\nassessee claimed that sufficient efforts were not made the said party\nfor bringing the business and most of the efforts was made by the\nassessee. The nature of disputes along with various documentary\nevidences and the submission has been filed and discussed in the\nforegoing paragraphs with regard to each and every business\ndevelopment arrangement with Govinda Infraproperty. Nowhere has it\nbeen disputed that such an advance was not given nor it has been\nfound that it was not a genuine transaction. The only reason given by\nld. CIT (A) is that why such an advance was given and same has been\nrejected by the Ld. CIT (A) flimsy ground. Each and every point raised\nby the DCIT in response to inquiry<a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_192\"> u/s. 133(6)</a> and the finding of the\nAssessing Officer in the remand report which has been followed by the\nld. CIT (A) has duly been explained with cogent reasons and\ndocuments. Thus, it cannot be held that there was no business\nadvance or there can be any iota of doubt that such advance had\nbecome irrecoverable which assessee has written off. Once, during the\ncourse of carrying out business any advance has been given for the\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">                                                 I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020   90</span>\n\n\nbusiness purpose and the same was not being recovered or it had\nbecome irrecoverable due to dispute, then if it has been written off by\nthe assessee, then such a loss has to be allowed in the computation of\nprofit and loss account. It is a decision of the company or the\nbusinessman to write off such an advance. There are cogent reasons\nfor non recovery and consequently any loss arising from such writing\noff cannot be questioned nor the prudence of the businessman and\ncan be questioned as held by the Hon&#x27;ble Supreme Court in the\njudgment cited above. All the submission and explanation by the ld.\ncounsel incorporated above are not only plausible explanation but also\nfully supported by documentary evidences filed before the authorities\nbelow. We are thus in tandem with the submission of the Ld. Counsel\nand accordingly, the loss claimed on such an advance given to\nGovinda Infraproperty is accepted and same is directed to be allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_343\">72.    Similarly, with regard to advance written off in the case of\nLinton Distributors Pvt. Ltd., the assessee had entered into contract\nwith the said party to secure more than 2600 sites of Quippo Telecom\nInfrastructure Limited by providing Care Taker/Security Guards to\ntake the position over the sites. The company has also issued\npurchase order for supply of shoes for the said caretaker/security\nguards for which the copy of purchase order has also been placed in\nthe paper book. As per the purchase order, there 5250 pieces of\ncomplete uniform @ Rs. 2000/- per set and 2625 shoes @ Rs. 480/-\nwas ordered. The total purchase order amounting to Rs.1,17,50,000/-\nwas agreed between the parties as per the terms and conditions of the\npurchase and supply 100% amount was to be given and if there was\nany defect in the material supply the same was also agreed to\nreplace/remove at own cost of the supplier. The assessee in pursuance\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">                                                 I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020   91</span>\n\n\nof such purchase order had paid amount of Rs. 1 crore for which there\nis no dispute by the lower authorities. Thereafter from various\nexchange of letters and continuous update from the said party for the\nprogress of orders as there was delay and concern over the status of\nthe order, it is seen that certain disputes has arisen between the\nparties which has been explained from the exchange of letters placed\nin the paper book as incorporated above. It is also not in dispute that\nthe Linton has also acknowledged the amount of Rs.1,05,00,000/-.\nFurther, it was found that the fabrics so procured by Linton was not to\nthe specification of the appellant and were sub-standard, and there\nfurther dispute to the supply of materials with regard to the quality\nand the Linton has also made a counter claim of loss of Rs.25 lacs. It\nthen requested to increase the contract value by the said amount\nwhich was immediately opposed. The factum of the transaction and\nthe dispute between the parties has been discussed in detail which\nwas for more than four years and no work was done on the said order\nand accordingly the order was terminated resulting into loss to the\nassessee. Assessee in order to avoid long drawn litigation process\nhence decided to write off the advance on 27.03.2015. Again there is\nno dispute that the assessee did paid the amount for purchase order\nand also demonstrated that such an order was not carried out in the\nmanner in which both the parties have agreed and serious dispute\narose between the parties which force the assessee to write of the said\nadvance given towards purchase order. Therefore, the loss claimed in\nthis year cannot be held to be non genuine. Even the inquiry and\nobservations made by the Assessing Officer<a href=\"/doc/1106823/\" id=\"a_193\"> u/s.133(6)</a> had already\nbeen explained by the assessee in detail as incorporated above and\nalso each and every observation of the Assessing Officer in the remand\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">                                                  I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020   92</span>\n\n\nreport which has no adverse inference. Neither the Assessing Officer\nnor ld. CIT (A) can question the credibility of assessee whether the said\nparty was capable of complying with the said order or did not had any\nexperience or there is any inquiry leading to any finding that said\nparty was itself bogus. Again the wisdom and the business prudence of\nthe assessee cannot be questioned to test the said transaction on\npreponderance of probability when there is no adverse material against\nthe assessee with regard to business dealing of the assessee with the\nsaid party. The reasoning given by the ld. CIT(A) for disallowing the\nsaid claim of loss cannot be accepted and the explanation and the\nsubmission given by the assessee with the documentary evidence as\ndiscussed above are accepted and hence the loss claimed with regard\nto advance paid to this party is allowed as business loss.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_344\">73.   In the case of Om Sai Assotech Pvt. Ltd., again it was on account\nof works contract awarded by the appellant executed by M/s. Environ\nEnergy Pvt. Ltd. for comprehensive operations and maintenance of\nsites in Rest of West Bengal (ROWB) circle maintained by VIOM\nNetworks. This company was engaged in the business of undertaking\ncivil contract and maintenance works. The assessee company in order\nto sub-contract the work awarded by Environ Energy had entered into\nagreement    with   Om    Sai   for   comprehensive     operations         and\nmaintenance of Passive Infrastructure of sites in ROWB Circle. The\nletter of award clearly defines the scope of services required to be\nundertaken by Om Sai and also provided for the payment terms\nrequired to be made by the appellant. During the course of process of\nexecution of the contract, payment was made by the assessee-\ncompany and Environ Energy to the sub-contractors and vendors of\nOm Sai and has also made payments towards statutory dues which\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_169\">                                                   I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020   93</span>\n\n\nhas been incorporated above. Various invoices were also raised from\ntime to time by the Om Sai for the settlement of the said amount based\non invoices and payments aggregating to Rs.468.59 lacs was made\nafter the payment as per the demand raised by the Om Sai, it was\ndiscovered that due to certain defaults and short comings of Om Sai in\nthe execution of the work Environ Energy had made certain deduction\nfor which the assessee after making repeated request and series of\ndiscussion managed to get the said deduction/penalty reduced. The\nassessee also realized that certain excess payments were made by the\nappellant on behalf of Om Sai as discussed above. The assessee\nrequested and duly informed Om Sai about the proposed deduction\nand liability towards the sub-contractor which were discharged by the\nassessee on its behalf, however, Om Sai failed to settled the accounts\nand there arose a dispute between the assessee and Om Sai. There is a\nletter written by the assessee raising a final demand notice on\n01.04.2014 calling upon it to make a payment of Rs.1,56,64,000/-\ntowards the excess amount towards deductions proposed by Environ\nEnergy. However, the said party did not make the payment. The\nassessee has also filed the suit against the High Court claiming the\namount along with interest and OM Sai has filed a counter claim\nbefore the High Court against the assessee for recovery of sum of\nRs.9.30 crores against the appellant. Thereafter, the assessee finally\nconsidered that there is no point going through for protracted litigation\nand took a business decision to write off the amount in its books.\nSuch write off of loss is incidental to the business operation; therefore,\nwe do not find any reason as to why such loss can be disallowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_345\">74.   In so far as the issues raised in the remand report and the\nallegations of the ld. CIT(A) has been duly explained with proper facts\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_170\">                                                  I.T.A. No.1615/DEL/2020   94</span>\n\n\nand evidences which has been discussed in the foregoing paragraphs,\nand therefore, in the light of the explanation given by the assessee, the\nfinding and observation of the ld. CIT(A) is unacceptable and the same\nis rejected. Accordingly, the said loss given by the assessee on account\nof advance/payment made to Om Sai is allowed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_346\">75.     Lastly, with regard to Metro Railways Kolkata also there was\nnotice inviting tender issued by Metro Railway Department Kolkata for\n(KMR)   for   &#x27;Supply,   installation,   commissioning,      operation      &amp;\nmaintenance of IP based Surveillance system, Personal Baggage\nScreening system and Explosive Detection &amp; Disposal System at 23\nMetro Railway station premises and Metro Rail Bhavan&#x27;, in response to\nwhich the appellant company (BCL) had bid for the same. Having\nsatisfied the technical parameters required under the NIIT and since\nthe appellant&#x27;s bid was the lowest, it was awarded the contract for\n&#x27;Supply, installation, commissioning, operation &amp; maintenance of IP\nbased Surveillance system, Personal Baggage Screening system and\nExplosive Detection &amp; Disposal System at 23 Metro Railway station\npremises and Metro Rail Bhavan&#x27;, vide Letter of Acceptance issued on\n25/02/2011.

A total Security Deposit for the Contract @ 5 % of the accepted value\nof Rs.17,07,35,271/- being Rs.85,36,764/- was to be deposited.\nHowever, Rs.14,15,130/- being the Earnest Money Deposited (EMD)\ndeposited with the offer was retained by KMR as part of the Security\nDeposit.

The said\nRetention Security Deposit of Rs.71,21,634/- was to deducted by KMR\nat the rate of 10% from the bills raised on KMR as and when they were\nraised.

Also,\nthe appellant company was to immediately furnish the performance\nbank guarantee to the tune of Rs. 85,36,764/- equivalent to 5% of the\nContract value. Another Letter of Acceptance dated 11/04/2011 was\nissued by KMR in continuation of the previous letter giving in details\nthe description of works, units, quantities, etc. However, after a delay\nof almost four months from the date of issuance of the Letter of\nAcceptance, a Memorandum of Agreement dated 03/06/2011 (&quot;MOA&quot;)\nwas finally executed between the appellant and KMR whereby the\nappellant&#x27;s scope of work included supply, installation, commissioning\nof Internet Protocol based Surveillance System, Personal and Baggage\nScreening System and Explosive Detection and Disposal System at 23\nMetro Railway Station premises and Metro Rail Bhavan. The appellant\nwas to maintain equipment at all locations as specified by KMR. The\nsaid contract would require deployment of manpower in the number of\n145 personnel.

After repeated requests and reminders KMR,\nthe KMR had failed and neglected to pay the aforesaid amount and in\nfact pointing out certain defects for doing unsatisfactory work the\nassessee-company     thereafter   decided    that     the      deposit      of\nRs.71,21,634/- was no longer realizable at all and the same was\ntreated as loss which was written off with the account. The entire\ndetail and discussion about the manner in which the dispute had\narisen and why the assessee was forced to write off the said deposit\npaid to the KMR has been discussed in detail in the foregoing\nparagraphs. The matter had also reached to stage of an arbitration as\nper the Hon&#x27;ble Kolkata High Court order and the consequence of\nwritten off had already been stated above.
