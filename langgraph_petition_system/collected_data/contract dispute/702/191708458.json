The Petitioner invoked arbitration by its notice dated 09.06.2022\n                          whereby the Petitioner had inter alia sought the payment of claim amount\n                          of Rs. 55,50,91,763.36 including interest for the extra items/extra work\n                          done by the Petitioner and has accordingly, sought to refer the dispute to\n                          arbitration. However, the Respondent rejected the same on the ground\n                          that the Petitioner&#x27;s notice had exceeded the prescribed time limit under\n                          Clause 17.4 of the GCC.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_9\">                          7.     The Respondent further stated in its notice that the Petitioner had\n                          submitted the No Claims Declaration dated 19.03.2021, as per which\n                          once the final payment under the contract is released, then the contractual\n                          agreement including the arbitration clause would be instantly discharged\n                          and rescinded. However, it is contested by the Petitioner that the No\n                          Claims Declaration had been obtained by the Respondent under economic\n                          duress and coercion by refusing to release any payment which was due to\n                          the Petitioner, and thus, the No Claim Declaration should be rejected by\n                          the court.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_10\">                          8.

Learned counsel appearing on behalf of the Petitioner submitted\n                          that the Respondent had added extra work items and had changed the\n                          scope of the work from time to time, and the Petitioner duly completed\n                          the extra work on the Respondent&#x27;s assurance that they will make due\n                          payments for the same. It is submitted that the Petitioner had executed the\n                          extra work and had apprised the Respondent and raised bills for the extra\n                          work in a timely manner, however the same was not honoured by the\n                          Respondent and hence a due amount of Rs.55,50,91,763.36 has arisen.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_13\">                          10.    It is further submitted that the Respondents were intentionally\n                          avoiding the same to unjustly enrichen themselves, despite the prior\n                          understanding of the parties in this regard. Furthermore, they had never\n                          contested claims for extra work in the Petitioner&#x27;s communications\n                          during the concerned time frame. They also failed to make the payment\n                          after the completion and acceptance of the Petitioner&#x27;s services. It is\n                          stated that the Petitioner vide letter dated 30.06.2021 had delineated the\n                          extra work undertaken by them vis-Ã -vis the GCC and had enclosed the\n                          details pertaining to the extra work carried out and apprised them the\n                          costs for it amounting to Rs. 55,50,91,763.36, which is the value of the\n                          present dispute.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_14\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"8204676\" id=\"span_19\">11.

Therefore, the Petitioner is within the\n                          prescribed time limit to raise the dispute and refer the same to arbitration.\n                          The Learned Counsel for the Petitioner has also relied on the precedents\n                          in <a href=\"/doc/8204676/\" id=\"a_5\">Grasim Industries Ltd. v.

Learned counsel for the Petitioner argued that the No Claims\n                          Declaration does not absolve the Respondent of making payments\n                          towards the extra work, since the same is baseless as they were apprised\n                          of the Extra Work done from time to time.

From a reading of <a href=\"/doc/63461877/\" id=\"a_15\">section 11(6A)</a>, the intention of the\n                                 legislature is crystal clear i.e., the court should and need to\n                                 only look into one aspect- the existence of an arbitration\n                                 agreement. What are the factors for deciding as to whether\n                                 there is an arbitration agreement is the next question. The\n                                 resolution to that is simple- it needs to be seen if the agreement\n                                 contains a clause which provide for arbitration pertaining to\n                                 the dispute which have arisen between the parties to the\n                                 agreement.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">                          19.

It has been admitted by the petitioner\n                          that the said amount has been paid. Thus, since the arbitration clause is no\n                          more existent, therefore, the current matter cannot be referred to\n                          arbitration and the petition is liable to be dismissed.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">                          <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"748038\" id=\"span_46\">22.    It is further submitted that the Petitioner&#x27;s plea that the No Claims\n                          Declaration was obtained under economic duress and coercion is an\n                          afterthought and the Petitioner never took any action for invoking the\n                          arbitration clause for 15 months since the Declaration was provided.\n                          Thus, it is evident that the Petitioner was satisfied with his payment and\n                          the present petition is merely an afterthought. Learned counsel for the\n                          Respondent has relied upon the judgment in <a href=\"/doc/748038/\" id=\"a_17\">Continental Construction\n                          Ltd. v.

Learned counsel for the Respondent has argued that the instant\n                          petition is liable to be dismissed since the Petitioner failed to invoke the\n                          contractual arbitration clause in terms of the Clause 17.4 pertaining to\n                          &quot;notice of dispute&quot;, as per which the notice of dispute is to be served no\n                          later than 28 days after the issuance of the performance certificate. It is\n                          stated that the Petitioner had received the performance certificate on 8th\n                          April 2021 and the notice of dispute was served to the Respondent after\n                          nearly 14 months, on 9th June 2022. Furthermore, this also signifies that\n                          the instant petition is merely an afterthought of the Petitioner and the\n                          Petitioner has not invoked the arbitration in terms of Clause 17 of the\n                          GCC, and hence, the Respondent rejected the same.\n</p>\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_47\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_48\">Digitally Signed By:GAURAV</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_49\">                             ARB.P. 1140/2022                                            Page 8 of 33</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_50\">SHARMA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_51\">Signing Date:02.02.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_52\">18:18:53</span>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_28\">                                        NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2023/DHC/000744\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_29\">                          24.

There is,\n                                 however, a distinction between jurisdictional and admissibility\n                                 issues. An issue of &quot;jurisdiction&quot; pertains to the power and\n                                 authority of the arbitrators to hear and decide a case.\n                                 Jurisdictional issues include objections to the competence of the\n                                 arbitrator or tribunal to hear a dispute, such as lack of consent,\n                                 or a dispute falling outside the scope of the arbitration\n                                 agreement. Issues with respect to the existence, scope and\n                                 validity of the arbitration agreement are invariably regarded as\n                                 jurisdictional issues, since these issues pertain to the\n                                 jurisdiction of the tribunal.\n</blockquote>\n\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">Signature Not Verified</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_164\">Digitally Signed By:GAURAV</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_165\">                             ARB.P. 1140/2022                                               Page 25 of 33</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_166\">SHARMA</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_167\">Signing Date:02.02.2023</span>\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_168\">18:18:53</span>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_36\">                                        NEUTRAL CITATION NO: 2023/DHC/000744\n\n\n\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_37\">                                 39.

Admissibility relates to the\n                                 nature of the claim or the circumstances connected therewith.\n                                 An admissibility issue is not a challenge to the jurisdiction of\n                                 the arbitrator to decide the claim.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_38\">                                 40.
