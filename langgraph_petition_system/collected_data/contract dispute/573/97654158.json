JUSTICE CHAKRADHARI SHARAN SINGH)\n    Date: 12-05-2016\n                         These appeals arise out of common judgment and\n\n          order, dated 22.09.2015, passed by the learned single Judge\n\n          of this Court on a writ application filed under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_4\">Article 226</a> of the\n\n          Constitution of India by               Mora Tollways Limited, a company\n\n          incorporated under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_5\">Companies Act, 1956</a>\n\n          (hereinafter referred to as the „Companies‟).                  The said\n\n          Company is the appellant of L.P.A. No. 2158 of 2015.               The\n\n          Bihar State Road Development Corporation Limited and others\n\n          (hereinafter referred to as the „Corporation‟) and its\n\n          functionaries, who were impleaded as respondent Nos. 3 to 9\n\n          in the writ proceedings before learned Single Judge, have also\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n                                         5/208\n\n\n\n\n          questioned the legality of the same judgment and order passed\n\n          by the learned single Judge by filing LPA No. 2084 of 2015.\n\n          The State of Bihar has filed another appeal being L.P. A. No.\n\n          2131 of 2015, who were respondent Nos. 1 and 2 in the writ\n\n          proceedings, being aggrieved by the same judgment and order\n\n          of the learned single Judge.\n\n                         2. This is the reason why all the three appeals have\n\n          been heard together, with the consent of the parties, and are\n\n          being disposed of by the present common judgment and order.\n\n                         3.     Before I advert to the extensive arguments\n\n          advanced on behalf of the Company, the Corporation and the\n\n          State of Bihar, it would be apt to take note of the conclusion\n\n          arrived at by learned single Judge in the order under appeal,\n\n          and    legal    reasoning        assigned   for   such   conclusion   since\n\n          sustainability of the said order is in question, in the present\n\n          batch of appeals.         For the said purpose, I have considered it\n\n          appropriate to take brief note of the admitted facts mentioned\n\n          by learned single Judge, which are foundation for arriving at\n\n          the said conclusion.\n\n                         4.    There was a notice/request for qualification,\n\n          dated 16.07.2010, by the Corporation for the purpose of\n\n          construction, operation and maintenance of National Highway\n\n          No.30 in the State of Bihar, including the section from km\n\n          0.000 to km 116.760 on Mohania-Ara section of National\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n                                         6/208\n\n\n\n\n          Highway No.30, by Four Laning on Design, Build, Finance,\n\n          Operate and Transfer (&quot;DBFOT&quot;) basis.                          Atlanta Ltd., a\n\n          Company incorporating under the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_6\">Companies Act, 1956</a> had\n\n          submitted bit in pursuance thereof and was short listed.\n\n          Cosequent upon its short listing, the Company was created as\n\n          special purpose vehicle by parent Company, and registered\n\n          under the provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1353758/\" id=\"a_7\">Companies Act, 1956</a> by its parent\n\n          company, viz, Atlanta Ltd. Consequent upon the short listing\n\n          of the parent Company, and creation of Mora Tollways\n\n          Company Limited, as special purpose vehicle for the said\n\n          purpose, a Concession Agreement was entered into between\n\n          the Corporation and the company, on 10.09.2011.\n\n                         5. It is mystery why the Concession Agreement has\n\n          been described as between &quot;the Governor of State of Bihar,\n\n          represented by its Managing Director, Bihar State Road\n\n          Development          Corporation           Limited   through     its   Managing\n\n          Director, Central Mechanical Workshop Campus, Sheikhpura,\n\n          Patna&quot;, when the agreement appears to be between the\n\n          Corporation and the Company.                         I have not gone into\n\n          consequence of such recital in the agreement, in view of the\n\n          nature of dispute involved, as is being discussed hereinabove.\n\n                         6.       The    Company,         before   entering      into   the\n\n          agreement had made demands for grant of mining lease for\n\n          stone quarries as according to it, the bid had been submitted\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n                                         7/208\n\n\n\n\n          keeping in mind the facilities that were available of mining of\n\n          aggregates         from    stones      quarries     in   possession      of   the\n\n          Government of Bihar. The bid period was extended from time\n\n          to time on four occasions. Finally, the Company entered into a\n\n          Concession Agreement on 10.09.2011. It is the case of the\n\n          Company that the bids submitted by it was conditional, subject\n\n          to making facilities for mining of aggregates from nearby\n\n          quarries      in    possession         of   the    Government       of    Bihar.\n\n          Alternatively, according to them, procuring aggregates from\n\n          the    neighbouring         states     would      have   incurred   additional\n\n          expenditure and, therefore, necessitated reimbursement of\n\n          extra lead of aggregates, entry tax, toll tax etc, which would\n\n          need to be reimbursed by the Corporation.\n\n                         7. The fact remains that there was no such\n\n          stipulation in the Concession Agreement entered into on\n\n          10.09.2011</pre><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_1\">.         This is also not in dispute that at the time of\n\n          entering into agreement, mining of stone quarries in the State\n\n          of Bihar was impermissible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">                         8. The Corporation, through its Managing Director,\n\n          made request to the Collector, Rohtas to take necessary action\n\n          for relaxation of the rules in special cases in terms of <a href=\"/doc/198881428/\" id=\"a_8\">Mines &amp;\n\n          Mineral (Development &amp; Regulation) Act, 1957</a>.                         Since no\n\n          decision, to allow mining in the State of Bihar was taken by the\n\n          State Government of Bihar, the matter was referred to an\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_1\">                                         8/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n          independent engineers engaged by the Corporation.                             The\n\n          independent          engineers,         after    obtaining     legal    opinion\n\n          recommended either for allotment of mines or for the\n\n          reimbursement of the additional costs of procuring aggregates\n\n          from neighbouring State, estimated at Rs. 410.13/- crores, to\n\n          the Company.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">                         9. The Corporation, however, rejected the claim of\n\n          the Company for reimbursement of the additional cost to be\n\n          incurred on procurement of aggregates from neighbouring\n\n          States through letter, dated 16.06.2014, there being no\n\n          provisions for extra lead of aggregates in the Concession\n\n          Agreement. This is evident from the minutes of the meeting\n\n          held on 05.08.2014.

In\n                         the affidavit of urgency (available at pp. 52 to 55)\n                         filed by Shri Rajendra Kumar Jain, son of the\n                         appellant, the said office note (available at pp. 54\n                         and 55 of the paper-book), has been reproduced.\n                         We questioned counsel for the appellant as to how\n                         the appellant was able to produce a copy of the\n                         office note dated 4-4-1996. The appellant having\n                         produced the said document, a duty is cast on him\n                         to explain the source from which he obtained the\n                         said copy and in what circumstances he            could\n                         obtain the same. This is all the more so, since\n                         reference has been made in the affidavit of urgency\n                         dated 14-6-1996 to the said document. Counsel for\n                         the appellant declined to disclose the source from\n                         where he obtained a copy of the said document. On\n                         the other hand, he vehemently stated that this Court\n                         should call upon the Registrar of the Patna High\n                         Court to explain and it is no part of his duty to\n                         explain as to how he obtained a copy of the\n                         document. To say the least, we are surprised at the\n                         attitude of the appellant&#x27;s counsel in totally refusing\n                         to disclose the source from which the appellant\n                         obtained a copy of the document. In our opinion, the\n                         appellant and his counsel owe a duty to this Court to\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_24\">                                        28/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n                         disclose the source or circumstances under which\n                         the said document dated 4-4-1996 was obtained.\n                         We express our strong displeasure at the attitude of\n                         the appellant and his counsel in totally refusing to\n                         disclose to the Court the manner in which a\n                         document filed in court was obtained. For the\n                         present, we do not want to say anything further in\n                         this matter, but we want to make it clear that the\n                         attitude adopted is totally reprehensible and cannot\n                         be countenanced by a court of law.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_30\">                         34. Further, there is nothing in the said legal\n\n          opinion of learned Senior Counsel, Mr. Lalit Kishore, to show\n\n          that in his opinion that the Company was liable for making\n\n          such payment. It contains mere reference of a fact that the\n\n          independent engineers have pointed out that in case of\n\n          termination of the contract, the concessionaire would be\n\n          entitled to payment for 602.00 crores.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_31\">                         35.    In my view, the question whether a dispute\n\n          exists for payment of amount will arise only after an amount\n\n          has been computed explicitly, by either of the parties to an\n\n          agreement. The entire case of the Company is based on the\n\n          said opinion of the independent engineers. Further, there is\n\n          nothing on record to show that there was any agreement\n\n          between the parties the amount as might be determined by\n\n          the independent engineers shall be liable to be paid by the\n\n          parties concerned, without raising any dispute.\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_25\">                                        29/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">                         36.    I am, therefore, of the considered view that\n\n          this Court, in the present facts and circumstances of the case\n\n          cannot issue a direction for payment of amount as claimed by\n\n          the Company in his writ application. Learned single Judge has\n\n          rightly held that quantification of the amount would require\n\n          detailed investigation and adduction of evidence. I do not find\n\n          any valid reason to interfere with the said order of the learned\n\n          single Judge.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_33\">                         37.     Of    course,       the     question    of   consequent\n\n          termination payment, as envisaged under Article 37.1.3 of the\n\n          Concession Agreement, would arise only if termination of the\n\n          agreement for authority default is held to be justified. Such\n\n          termination can be held to be justified, if the other side, i.e.,\n\n          the Corporation, in the present case, does not raise any\n\n          dispute against such termination and specifically accepts that\n\n          there has been default on its part.                      Can this Court, in a\n\n          proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_42\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India,\n\n          conclusively       hold,     on   the      basis    of   affidavits,   that   the\n\n          termination        notice,     dated       20.02.2015,        issued    by    the\n\n          Company, is beyond the scope of being questioned by the\n\n          Corporation or any dispute, arising out of the said notice, is\n\n          beyond the scope of arbitration Article on the ground that\n\n          default, on the part of the Corporation, is an admitted fact, is\n\n          question, which is to be kept in mind while adjudicating the\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_26\">                                        30/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n          present matter.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_34\">                         38. Provision for reimbursement of additional cost\n\n          of procuring aggregates from neighbouring States, in the\n\n          absence of grant of mining lease, within the State of Bihar,\n\n          was one of the main issues being consistently raised by the\n\n          Company. It is to be noted that the issue was raised by the\n\n          Company, in view of the ban on crushing of stones in the\n\n          State of Bihar. This was never a part of the agreement that\n\n          the mining lease shall be granted to the Company for\n\n          execution of the work.                 <a href=\"/doc/624769/\" id=\"a_43\">Article 12.1(d)</a> of the Concession\n\n          Agreement provides thus:-\n</p>\n<pre id=\"pre_5\">                                         &quot;Prior            to   commencement          of\n                              construction           works,       the    Concessionaire\n                              shall    make          its    own    arrangements      for\n                              quarrying       of      materials     needed     for   the\n                              Project Highway under and in accordance\n                              with the Applicable Laws and Applicable\n                              Permits.&quot;\n                                                                   (Emphasis is mine)\n\n\n</pre><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_35\">                         39.

From the minutes of the review meeting, held\n\n          on 12.05.2014, the Company again raised an issue of payment\n\n          of extra lead of aggregates.                The description of the said\n\n          meeting, in relation to the concerned item, reads thus:-\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_46\">                                         &quot;Payment          of    extra    lead   of\n                              aggregate: The Concessionaire raised the\n                              issue     of       payment    of    extra   lead   of\n                              aggregate.

The dispute, on the question of termination of\n\n          Concession Agreement, is evident from the correspondence\n\n          made between the Corporation and the Company.

Within 15 days of\n\n          the said notice, the Corporation, on 16.02.2015, responded to\n\n          the said notice, as contemplated under Article 37.2.2 of the\n\n          Concession Agreement.                  In the said communication, dated\n\n          16.02.2015, the Corporation dealt with all the points raised by\n\n          the Company for issuing the notice of intent of termination of\n\n          agreement. On the question of non-payment of additional cost\n\n          incurred by the Company for procurement of aggregates, it\n\n          was pointed out firstly that it was the responsibility of the\n\n          Company, in terms of <a href=\"/doc/624769/\" id=\"a_44\">Article 12.1(d)</a> of the Concession\n\n          Agreement.

It was specifically mentioned in the said letter,\n\n          dated 16.02.2015, that the notice of intent of termination of\n\n          agreement was illegal and invalid. The Company was asked\n\n          to withdraw his notices, dated 09.08.2014 and 04.02.2015.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_52\">                         49. Upon perusal of the notice of intent to\n\n          terminate the Concession Agreement, dated 04.02.2015, and\n\n          representation, dated 16.02.2015, I find that there are\n\n          disputed questions of facts with respect to alleged default by\n\n          the Corporation, which could have given the Company a valid\n\n          right to invoke <a href=\"/doc/1406604/\" id=\"a_45\">Article 44</a> of the Concession Agreement.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_53\">                         50. An argument has been advanced on behalf of\n\n          the Company that after issuance of notice, dated 04.02.2015,\n\n          the Corporation, through a letter, dated 07.02.2015, had\n\n          asked the Company to submit the details of all material,\n\n          stores, plants &amp; machineries and equipments available at the\n\n          site of the Authority, pursuant to <a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_46\">Article 37.4(b)</a> of the\n\n          Concession Agreement and, accordingly, the Company waived\n\n          the right of representation, under Article 37.2.2 of the\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_33\">                                         37/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n          Concession Agreement.                   The said contention is fit to be\n\n          rejected. <a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_47\">Article 37.4</a> of the Concession Agreement provides\n\n          for     the   rights     and     obligations    of   the    Authority       upon\n\n          termination for any reason whatsoever.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_54\">                         51. <a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_48\">Article 37.4</a> provides that upon termination,\n\n          the Corporation will be deemed to have been in possession\n\n          and control of the Project Highway forthwith.                        This is a\n\n          deeming        Article    and      operates     automatically        once     the\n\n          Concession Agreement stands terminated.                       <a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_49\">Article 37.4(b)</a>\n\n          further provides for taking possession and control of all\n\n          materials,      stores,      implements,       construction     plants        and\n\n          equipments on or about the site. This provision contemplates\n\n          taking actual physical possession and control of the Articles,\n\n          as mentioned above.              Issuance of letter, dated 07.02.2015,\n\n          does not amount to invoking <a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_50\">Article 37.4(b)</a> of the Concession\n\n          Agreement.          Through said letter, the Corporation merely\n\n          sought for the information and details of all materials, stores,\n\n          construction plants and equipments on or above the site, so\n\n          that, if needed, possession of the same can be taken over. It\n\n          will,    in   no    circumstance,          amount    to    waiving    right    of\n\n          representation within 15 days of issuance of termination\n\n          notice, dated 04.02.2015. This is apparent from the fact that\n\n          within 15 days of the said notice, the Corporation filed its\n\n          representation, raising the dispute, through letter, dated\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_34\">                                        38/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n          16.02.2015.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_55\">                         52. In such circumstance, it cannot be held that\n\n          there was no dispute between the parties on the question of\n\n          default on the part of the Corporation, leading to issuance of\n\n          termination notice, invoking Article 37.2.2 of the Concession\n\n          Agreement. It cannot be said, in the facts and circumstances\n\n          and on the basis of materials available on the record, that\n\n          there was no scope for the Corporation to raise any dispute\n\n          against termination of Concession Agreement since the facts\n\n          are not admitted.             In my view, in the given facts and\n\n          circumstances of the case, the learned Single Judge rightly\n\n          gave the Corporation and the State of Bihar an opportunity to\n\n          question the validity of the termination notice, issued by the\n\n          Company.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_56\">                         53.

For example, when\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_40\">                                        42/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n                              an issue arises whether in a particular State\n                              there are toilets for school children and\n                              there is an assertion by the State that there\n                              are good toilets, definitely the Court can\n                              appoint a Committee to verify the same. It\n                              is because the lis is not adversarial in\n                              nature. The same principle cannot be taken\n                              recourse to in respect of a contractual\n                              controversy.

A submission was advanced that once learned\n\n          single Judge has held the writ application to be maintainable,\n\n          he ought not to have relegated the appellant and the parties\n\n          to the forum of arbitration.               According to Mr. Giri, learned\n\n          Senior Counsel appearing on behalf of the appellant, the\n\n          learned single Judge ought to have decided the dispute on the\n\n          basis of admitted facts and materials on record, after having\n\n          held the writ application to be maintainable. I do not find any\n\n          force in such submission. Maintainability of an application and\n\n          grant of relief sought for in the said application are two\n\n          different aspects.          The writ petition filed by the Company\n\n          could not have been held to be not maintainable in the\n\n          absence of any bar against filing of such application. Existence\n\n          of an alternative remedy is not a bar in invoking writ\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_45\">                                        46/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n          jurisdiction of the High Court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_68\">Article 226</a> of the\n\n          Constitution of India. Learned single Judge accordingly, held\n\n          writ application to be maintainable, despite there being\n\n          alternative remedy of arbitration.         But while considering the\n\n          relief sought for, learned single Judge refused to decide the\n\n          question of quantum consequent termination payment as well\n\n          as justification of termination notice for authority‟s default\n\n          issued by the appellant-Company.              Learned single Judge\n\n          rightly observed that the dispute as to whether the said notice\n\n          issued by the Company was valid or not could not have been\n\n          unilaterally decided by the Corporation which was itself a\n\n          party to the contract. Learned single Judge, therefore, rightly\n\n          held that the termination notice for concessionaire default by\n\n          the Corporation treating the termination notice for authorities\n\n          default as invalid, was not proper and the Corporation, for\n\n          that purpose could have invoked the arbitration Article under\n\n          <a href=\"/doc/1406604/\" id=\"a_69\">Article 44</a> of the agreement. It is, however, made clear that\n\n          no observation made by learned single Judge in the order\n\n          under appeal shall be treated as finding, implied of explicit, on\n\n          correctness/validity or justifiability of the termination notices\n\n          issued by the Company.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_70\">                         65.

The attainment of socio-economic\n\n        justice being a conscious end of State policy, there is a vast and\n\n        inevitable increase in the frequency with which ordinary citizens\n\n        come into relationship of direct encounter with State power-\n\n        holders. This renders it necessary to structure and restrict the\n\n        power of the executive Government so as to prevent its\n\n        arbitrary application or exercise.

After submission of its bid, the writ petitioner\n\n        made demands for a Mining lease for stone quarries to be made\n\n        available to it inasmuch as the bid had been submitted keeping\n\n        in mind the facilities of mining aggregates from enumerated\n\n        quarries in the possession of the Government of Bihar and it\n\n        was duly indicated that in the absence of the mining lease, it\n\n        would be practically impossible for it to execute the project.

The matter was also referred to an\n\n        Independent          Engineer,        chosen   and   appointed   by   the\n\n        respondents, who recommended, by letter, dated 31.05.2013,\n\n        for either allotment of mines in favour of the writ petitioner or\n\n        for re-imbursement of additional cost of procuring aggregates\n\n        from neighbouring States estimated at Rs 410.13 crores to the\n\n        writ petitioner. However, in the meeting, dated 05.08.2014,\n\n        between the writ petitioner and the respondent authorities, it\n\n        was observed that the writ petitioner‟s claim, with regard to\n\n        extra lead aggregates, was not sustainable and this event led\n\n        the writ petitioner to serve a notice upon the respondent\n\n        authorities, in terms of Clause 37.2 of the Agreement, asking\n\n        the respondent authorities to cure the defaults within the\n\n        stipulated period of 90 days. Pursuant to the notice so served\n\n        under Clause 37.2 by the writ petitioner, the respondents, in a\n\n        meeting, dated 06.11.2014, agreed to cure the defaults and the\n\n        Chief General Manager of the respondent Corporation sent a\n\n        letter, dated 21.11.2014, addressed to the Principal Secretary,\n\n        Road Construction Department, Government of Bihar, seeking,\n\n        in principle, approval for payment of extra cost of carriage of\n\n        stone aggregates amounting to the tune of Rs. 435 crores to\n\n        the writ petitioner.

Consequently, „the writ petitioner‟ is being referred to\n\n        as „the writ petitioner‟, „the respondent Corporation‟ is being\n\n        referred to as „the respondent Corporation‟ and „the State\n\n        respondents‟ are being referred to as „the State respondents‟.\n\n        WHETHER THE WRIT PETITION WAS HEARD ONLY ON A\n\n        PRELIMINARY POINT: -\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_97\">                     88.

By referring to Clause 12.1(d), the respondents\n\n        stated that it is the responsibility of the writ petitioner to\n\n        procure aggregates or any other materials needed for the\n\n        project highway.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_194\">                       167.

It\n\n        mentions that the Concessionaire, the writ petitioner, shall\n\n        make its own arrangement for quarrying the materials needed\n\n        for the project highway under, and in accordance with,\n\n        applicable laws and applicable permits. Quarrying is an act of\n\n        removal of aggregates from the quarry, which the writ\n\n        petitioner had been demanding all along; but despite repeated\n\n        applications from the writ petitioner, the respondents had done\n\n        nothing to allow quarrying in the State of Bihar by granting\n\n        mining lease; rather, they permitted the writ petitioner to bring\n\n        aggregates from outside the State of Bihar, which the writ\n\n        petitioner, admittedly, did. Hence, quarrying, in the present\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_96\">                                        90/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        context, does not mean quarrying even though, when the\n\n        quarrying is prohibited law.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_195\">                       168. A further reading of paragraph 3.1 of Annexure\n\n        16 would show that respondents contended that by then, the\n\n        Govt. of Bihar had, vide Notification No. 3085/M, Patna, dated\n\n        11.08.2014, opened the mining lease for procurement of\n\n        aggregates and even then, the writ petitioner had not made any\n\n        efforts for procurement of aggregates.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_196\">                       169. However, it is not understood as to how\n\n        removal of prohibition on mining would automatically lead to an\n\n        inference that the writ petitioner would have been granted\n\n        mining lease, had he made such efforts. In fact, it would not be\n\n        proper to even suggest that writ petitioner had not put up\n\n        efforts to get a mining lease within the State of Bihar. The\n\n        letters, vide Annexure 29 and 30, indicate that writ petitioner\n\n        was pressing hard for a mining lease in the State of Bihar,\n\n        pursuant to which the letter, vide Annexure 32, was written by\n\n        respondent No. 4 to the Collector, Rohtas, Sasaram, for\n\n        considering the request of the writ petitioner in view of Rule 36\n\n        of the Rules under the Mines 86 Minerals (Development 86\n\n        Regulation) Act, 1957, as a special case.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_197\">                       170.

In view of the above sequence of events, the\n\n        first question, which needs an answer is whether, till the filing\n\n        of the writ petition, a dispute existed on the point that the writ\n\n        petitioner is not entitled to payment of additional cost for\n\n        procurement of aggregates from longer leads. If the answer to\n\n        this question is in the affirmative, the writ petition would not be\n\n        maintainable in view of <a href=\"/doc/1406604/\" id=\"a_104\">Article 44</a> containing a clause of\n\n        Arbitration. On the other hand, if the answer to the question, so\n\n        posed,      is    in   the    negative,      the    writ   petition   would    be\n\n        maintainable to the extent that no dispute existed for referral to\n\n        arbitral Tribunal.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_203\"> Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_99\">                                        93/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_204\">                       176. Recalling, at this stage, the process for\n\n        termination of agreement, as discussed hereinbefore, the party\n\n        called upon to cure the defects has two options; namely, he\n\n        may admit the defaults, or he may deny that defaults exist. A\n\n        dispute would arise only when there is a specific denial of\n\n        defaults as mentioned in the Notice to Cure defaults.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_205\">                       177. In the sequence of events, pointed out above,\n\n        it would be noticed that the writ petitioner had been urging the\n\n        respondents cure the defect with respect to procurement of\n\n        aggregates from longer leads. The respondents prevaricated on\n\n        this issue and, on one occasion, made an explicit promise to\n\n        cure the default.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_206\">                       178. Thus, the claim, as to additional cost, was\n\n        admitted, and, hence, the writ petitioner was asked to procure\n\n        aggregates from longer leads. A promise, on which the writ\n\n        petitioner acted and incurred financial expenditure under the\n\n        impression additional cost issue would be cured, has to be held\n\n        against the respondents. However, as no solution could be\n\n        arrived at nor was the claim denied, it amounted to a default on\n\n        the part of the respondents having a material adverse effect on\n\n        the project implementation. Once the notice to cure the defaults\n\n        was issued by the writ petitioner, on the ground of, amongst\n\n        others, additional cost, and the default was not denied by the\n\n        respondent, the stage for disputing the claim was over.\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_100\">                                        94/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        Thereafter, the only recourse, which the writ petitioner could\n\n        have taken, was to issue Notice of Intent to Terminate, which\n\n        the writ petitioner did issue. As the facts reveal, even after the\n\n        Notice of Intent to Terminate, the respondents did not deny the\n\n        contents of notice; rather, they took the follow up steps for\n\n        termination of agreement for taking possession and control of\n\n        the project in terms of Clause 37.4. Thus, a dispute was not\n\n        raised even after the Notice of Intent to terminate was issued.\n\n        Logically extended, it would mean that the stage for raising\n\n        dispute was already over.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_207\">                       179. Indeed, the respondent, vide letter, dated\n\n        16.02.2015 (Annexure 16), served a representation against the\n\n        Notice of Intent to Terminate issued by the writ petitioner; but\n\n        by then, the scope for raising dispute was over. If the\n\n        representation, vide Annexure 16, is construed as creating a\n\n        dispute on the claims made by the writ petitioner, then, on the\n\n        face of Annexure 12, it would amount to allowing the\n\n        respondents to approbate and reprobate. It is not permissible\n\n        for the respondents to once admit the default and take follow\n\n        up action in termination of the contract and, then, to turn\n\n        around and say that the Notice of Intent to Terminate, issued\n\n        by the writ petitioner, is illegal. It would be evident from the\n\n        conduct of the respondents that even though settlement of\n\n        financial claims was not arrived, yet so far as the termination of\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_101\">                                        95/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        agreement         is    concerned,           the   letter,   dated   04.02.2015\n\n        (Annexure 11), amounted to accord and satisfaction so far as\n\n        the issue of termination of agreement is concerned.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_208\">                       180. It is, thus, found that so far as the issue raised\n\n        by the writ petitioner, regarding payment of additional cost, for\n\n        procurement of aggregates from longer leads, is concerned, the\n\n        respondents not only admitted the default by promising to cure\n\n        it, but they also omitted to cure the default and this act of the\n\n        respondents amounts to default and not a dispute. The writ\n\n        petitioner had the liberty to initiate the process of termination\n\n        of agreement in the event of any one of the default occurring\n\n        within the meaning and scope of Clause 37.2.1.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_209\">                       181. Thus, it would be seen that there remains no\n\n        issue for adjudication by the Arbitration Tribunal as regard the\n\n        issues relating to payment of additional cost for procurement of\n\n        aggregates from longer leads and consequential termination of\n\n        agreement. In any view of the matter, if the respondents were\n\n        aggrieved by the act of the writ petitioner in issuing Notice of\n\n        intent to Terminate, and term it as &#x27;dispute&#x27; within the meaning\n\n        of <a href=\"/doc/1406604/\" id=\"a_105\">Article 44</a>, then, even they were at liberty to approach the\n\n        Arbitration Tribunal; but, as the records would show, the\n\n        respondents, too, never approached the Tribunal.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_210\">                       182.

The     basic       question,   which    needs      to   be\n\n        addressed, in the present appeal, is: whether the remedy\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_106\">                                        98/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        available, under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_112\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, can\n\n        legitimately be resorted to in order to obtaining a direction from\n\n        the High Court for payment of amounts due and payable by the\n\n        State Government in contractual matters and if so, in what\n\n        circumstances, such a remedy can be made available?\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_216\">                       186. While considering the question, posed above,\n\n        what needs to be noted is that a government contract, even if\n\n        commercial in nature, involves, broadly speaking, four stages.\n\n        The first stage relates to the floating of tenders by publishing\n\n        notice inviting tenders. At this stage, the authorities concerned\n\n        are required to formulate the terms and conditions subject to\n\n        which the tenders would be invited and also the terms and\n\n        conditions of the contract, which, if entered into, would govern\n\n        the parties. These terms and conditions would obviously include\n\n        all the eligibility criteria for a person to participate in the tender\n\n        process. After the notice inviting tender is published and the\n\n        tenders are received, the second stage of such a contract\n\n        commences. This stage involves the process of taking of the\n\n        decision to allot or not to allot the contract at all and cancel the\n\n        entire process. This stage would include selection of the person\n\n        or the party to whom the contract shall be allotted. This stage\n\n        ends with the allotment of the contract or with the decision not\n\n        to allot the contract at all and cancel the entire tender process.\n\n        The third stage of the contract essentially covers the stage of\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_107\">                                        99/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        performance         of    the     contract.   This   stage   would   include\n\n        commencement of the performance of the allotted contract and\n\n        would, normally, end with the completion of the allotted\n\n        contract. During this stage, there may arise the question of\n\n        breach of the contract, because of non-fulfilment of the terms\n\n        and conditions of the contract by either party to the contract.\n\n        The fourth stage of such a contract arises, when, on completion\n\n        of his part of the contract, the contractor or supplier raises his\n\n        demand for making payment of his bills. This fourth stage can,\n\n        however, be divided into two categories. There may be a case,\n\n        where the amount demanded is not disputed and yet the dues\n\n        of the contractor are not paid compelling thereby the contractor\n\n        to seek avenues for obtaining payment of his dues. In this\n\n        fourth stage, there may, however, be a case, where the\n\n        correctness of the demand for payment raised by the contractor\n\n        is disputed, denied or challenged by the authority, who had\n\n        allotted the contract. In such a case, too, the contractor may be\n\n        driven to take recourse to such avenues as may be open to\n\n        him, in law, for the purpose of enabling him to obtain his dues\n\n        in terms of the demand that he may have made.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_217\">                       <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"884513\" id=\"span_108\">187. It may, now, be pointed out that at the first\n\n        stage of a contract, which requires the authorities concerned to\n\n        formulate the terms and conditions subject to which the tenders\n\n        would be invited or the contract would be allotted, many factors\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_109\">                                       100/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        are taken into account. The decision as to what terms shall be\n\n        included in the tender is really a policy decision, for, it is the\n\n        authority, issuing the notice inviting tender, which is the best\n\n        judge to determine as to what terms and conditions would be\n\n        required for successful completion of the work or the project\n\n        concerned. Thus, it is, primarily, for the authority issuing the\n\n        NIT to decide what particular terms and conditions should be\n\n        incorporated in the NIT. However, when the invitation to tender\n\n        is floated, the second stage, which consists of the process of\n\n        selection of the person for awarding the contract, commences\n\n        and this process comes to an end, when a decision either\n\n        awarding the contract or cancelling the entire tender process is\n\n        taken. The decision to award the contract to a person, who\n\n        participates in a tender process, is not open to judicial review,\n\n        but the decision making process, which leads to the ultimate\n\n        decision, is, according to the law <a href=\"/doc/541216/\" id=\"a_113\">laid down in</a> <a href=\"/doc/884513/\" id=\"a_114\">Tata Cellular v.\n\n        Union of India</a>, reported in, (1994) 6 SCC 651, open to\n\n        judicial review.</span> <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Neutral\" data-docid=\"952082\" id=\"span_110\">In <a href=\"/doc/952082/\" id=\"a_115\">Raunaq International Ltd. v. I.V.R.\n\n        Construction Ltd. and Ors.</a>, (AIR 1999 SC 393), the Apex\n\n        Court has made it clear that though the decision to award a\n\n        contract is not open to judicial review, the decision making\n\n        process, which leads to the ultimate decision, is, indeed, open\n\n        to judicial review provided that there is an element of public\n\n        interest involved in the case requiring a review by the court of\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_111\">                                       101/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        the administrative decision to allot the contract.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_218\">                       188. What may be further noted is that at the first\n\n        and the second stage of the contracts, when the government or\n\n        any of its instrumentalities sets up the terms and conditions of\n\n        the contract or takes a decision to allot the contract, it acts\n\n        purely in its executive capacity and its action is, therefore, open\n\n        to judicial review, though in a limited way, as indicated\n\n        hereinabove. However, when the third stage is reached and a\n\n        contract       is    entered       into      by   the   government       or   its\n\n        instrumentality, on the one hand, and the contractor, on the\n\n        other, the parties are no longer governed by constitutional\n\n        provisions, but by the terms of the contract. Hence, when a\n\n        State, purporting to act within the field allotted to it under the\n\n        terms and conditions of a contract, performs an act, the rights\n\n        and obligations of the parties would be, ordinarily, governed by\n\n        the law that governs the terms and conditions of the contract.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_219\">                       189.      What       logically     follows   from   the    above\n\n        discussion is that in the third stage, which consists of the\n\n        performance of the contract, the remedy of the parties to the\n\n        contract for breach of any of the terms and conditions of the\n\n        contract would, ordinarily, lie in the civil court of competent\n\n        jurisdiction unless the parties have, under the terms of the\n\n        contract, agreed to refer such a dispute to arbitration. Thus,\n\n        ordinarily, no writ would be issued, under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_116\">Article 226</a> of the\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_112\">                                       102/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        Constitution of India, for a mere breach of the terms and\n\n        conditions of the contract, particularly, when, for settlement of\n\n        such a dispute, there is a provision for arbitration.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_220\">                       190. In the fourth stage of a contract, which arises\n\n        on completion of the contract, a demand for payment of bills or\n\n        Clues, raised by the contractor, may not be amenable to\n\n        arbitration proceedings, for, the authorities concerned, who had\n\n        allotted the contract, may dispute entitlement of the contractor\n\n        to receive the dues, which the contractor has demanded, or\n\n        there may be a case, wherein although no dispute is raised by\n\n        the authorities concerned that the bills are due and payable to\n\n        the contractor, the payment is not made.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_221\">                       191. In a case, wherein demands are not disputed,\n\n        but payment is not made, the demand for payment may or may\n\n        not be amenable to arbitration proceeding, for, it would\n\n        essentially depend upon the terms and conditions of the\n\n        contract inasmuch as the terms and conditions of the contract\n\n        would determine if, even for realization of an admitted amount\n\n        or even when there is no dispute as regards the dues claimed,\n\n        an arbitration proceeding can or must be resorted to. If no\n\n        provision for arbitration of such a claim has been made in the\n\n        contract agreement, the remedy of the person, who demands\n\n        payment, lies, ordinarily, in instituting suit in civil courts and\n\n        not in filing petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_117\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_113\">                                       103/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        India, seeking enforcement of the State&#x27;s obligation to pay its\n\n        dues.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_222\">                       192. What is, now, of immense importance to note\n\n        is that there may be a case, where the demand for payment\n\n        made by a contractor is disputed or there may be a cross-claim\n\n        raised by the State against the contractor. There may, however,\n\n        be cases, wherein the claim made by the contractor is admitted\n\n        and there is no cross-claim between the parties to be\n\n        determined. In such cases, there is really no dispute as regards\n\n        the facts. Would it, in such a case, be necessary for the writ\n\n        court to revert the party to the remedies available through the\n\n        civil court?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_223\">                       193. The answer to the crucial question, posed\n\n        above, hinges on the principle that if an alternative efficacious\n\n        remedy is available, writ jurisdiction shall not be exercised.\n\n        What is, of course, necessary to point out is that existence of\n\n        an alternative remedy is not an absolute bar to the jurisdiction\n\n        of the court under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_118\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, but is\n\n        always a matter of exercise of discretion and remains,\n\n        therefore, in the realm of prudence. What is, however, of great\n\n        relevance to note is that though a disputed question of fact is\n\n        not,    normally,       entertained          by   a   High   Court   in   its   writ\n\n        jurisdiction, it will not, as a corollary, follow that if there is no\n\n        disputed question of fact, remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_119\">Article 226</a> of the\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_114\">                                       104/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        Constitution of India would be available. The mere fact,\n\n        therefore, that in a writ petition, the bills, raised by a\n\n        contractor, are admitted to be due and payable by the State\n\n        cannot, in itself, be a ground for issuing a writ of mandamus to\n\n        the State respondents commanding them to make payment of\n\n        the dues of such a contractor. Conversely put, a State cannot\n\n        refuse to pay its dues without any good and sufficient cause or\n\n        else, its refusal would amount to its act being arbitrary and a\n\n        remedy under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_120\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, in such a\n\n        case, may not remain as an absolute bar. Necessarily,\n\n        therefore, it is the facts of a given case, which would decide\n\n        whether a writ of mandamus can be issued or not.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_224\">                       194. It may be further noted that a writ of\n\n        mandamus is a public remedy and this remedy lies, when a\n\n        public authority fails to perform the duty entrusted to it by law.\n\n        In other words, a writ of mandamus is issued against a person,\n\n        who has a legal duty to perform, but has failed or neglected to\n\n        do so. Distinguishing a case, wherein a public duty of a State is\n\n        sought to be enforced, and a case, wherein a contractual\n\n        obligation of a State is sought to be enforced, Professor Wade,\n\n        in his well-known treatise, &#x27;Administrative Law&#x27;, makes it clear\n\n        that while a public duty is enforceable by the public law remedy\n\n        of a writ of mandamus, a contractual duty is enforceable, as a\n\n        matter of private law, through the avenues of civil courts.

What, now, needs to be noted is that howsoever\n\n        thin and subtle may be, there is, indeed, a real and definite line\n\n        demarcation not only between a public wrong and a private\n\n        wrong, but also between a public law remedy and private law\n\n        remedy. <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_121\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India is pre-eminently\n\n        a public law remedy and is not, generally, available as a remedy\n\n        against private wrongs.

However,        the     scope     of\n                                 mandamus is limited to enforcement of public\n                                 duty. The scope of mandamus is determined\n                                 by the nature of the duty to be enforced,\n                                 rather than the identity of the authority\n                                 against whom it is sought. If the private body\n                                 is discharging a public function and the denial\n                                 of any right is in connection with the public\n                                 duty imposed on such body, the public law\n                                 remedy can be enforced. The duty cast on the\n                                 public    body      may     be   either    statutory   or\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_118\">                                       107/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n                                 otherwise and the source of such power is\n                                 immaterial, but, nevertheless, there must be\n                                 the public law element in such action.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_226\">                     196. Thus, in the face of succinctly laid down position\n\n        of law with regard to the issuance of a writ of mandamus under\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_127\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, what one has to bear in\n\n        mind is that in order to invoke the writ jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_128\">Article\n\n        226</a> of the Constitution of India, two conditions, in a case of\n\n        private wrong, must be satisfied, namely;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_227\">                        (i)     the identity of the person, against whom the\n                                writ is sought, as a person or body, which is\n                                amenable to writ jurisdiction, and\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_228\">                        (ii)    the nature of duty, which is sought to be\n                                enforced, is a public duty or has an element of\n                                public interest.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_229\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_230\">                     197. In a given case, one may, perhaps, ignore the\n\n        first pre-requisite, namely, the identity of the person or body as\n\n        a person or body amenable to writ jurisdiction, but the second\n\n        prerequisite, as indicated hereinbefore, cannot be ignored, for,\n\n        in the absence of public interest or in the absence of breach of\n\n        public duty or in the absence of any public wrong having been\n\n        committed, no recourse to <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_129\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of\n\n        India is possible.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_231\">                     198. What also needs to be cautiously noted is that\n\n        constitutional or statutory duty is a public duty and enforceable\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_119\">                                        108/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        by a writ of mandamus. To put it differently, the                      rights and\n\n        duties go hand-in-hand. When a right is given to a person by a\n\n        State, the State casts upon itself a duty to enforce such a right.\n\n        Logically, therefore, when a person is given fundamental right\n\n        by the Constitution, a duty rests on the State to ensure that the\n\n        person realizes his fundamental rights.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_232\">                     199. In a given case, therefore, if a person, aggrieved\n\n        by a breach of contract, shows that though the breach is in the\n\n        realm of a contract, the duty, sought to be enforced, is a\n\n        constitutional or statutory duty, the remedy of a writ of\n\n        mandamus may not be refused, for, it is the constitutional\n\n        obligation      of    the    High     Court,    under     <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_130\">Article    226</a>   of   the\n\n        Constitution of India, to enforce the constitutional and statutory\n\n        duties of the State and its instrumentalities.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_233\">                     200. The question, therefore, is as to whether every\n\n        breach of governmental obligation to pay its dues, under a\n\n        contract, falls outside the purview of <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_131\">Article 226</a> of the\n\n        Constitution of India. This brings us to a more important\n\n        question and the question is: Will the constitutional remedy of\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_132\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India never be available\n\n        against a State even if the State refuses to carry out its\n\n        contractual       obligations       with     ulterior     motives,    irrationally,\n\n        arbitrarily, unreasonably, unfairly, whimsically or when its\n\n        denial      suffers      from      mala      fide,   or     when     the    State,\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_120\">                                       109/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        demonstratively discriminates, while making payment of its\n\n        dues? Shall the writ court withdraw its hand resignedly and\n\n        helplessly by saying that a writ of mandamus is a public law\n\n        remedy and no writ of mandamus would be issued to any State\n\n        directing it not to discriminate or act irrationally, arbitrarily,\n\n        unreasonably, unfairly, whimsically, or with ulterior motives,\n\n        while refusing or omitting to make payment of its dues arising\n\n        out of contracts or when the State‟s denial is mala fide?\n\n        Imperative, therefore, for us to ask: Can a breach of contract\n\n        ever give rise to any constitutional obligation of the State to\n\n        make payment of its dues?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_234\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"541216\" id=\"span_121\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"541216\" id=\"span_122\">201.

The facts of the case of <a href=\"/doc/1056935/\" id=\"a_156\">Bishwanath Tea Co.\n\n        Ltd.</a> (supra) was that the respondent had filed a writ petition\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_138\">                                       114/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        questioning the action of the appellant, the Divisional Forest\n\n        Officer, Darrang Division, for recovering Rs 7069.37 as royalty\n\n        for cutting and felling trees from Tezalpatty Grant 1 held under\n\n        lease, dated September 27, 1932, and for a mandamus\n\n        directing the appellant to issue permits without insisting upon\n\n        payment of royalty for the trees cut and felled from the area\n\n        under lease. As against the writ petition, a preliminary objection\n\n        was raised by the appellant that the right, claimed by the\n\n        respondent, flowed from the contract of lease and such\n\n        contractual rights and obligations can only be enforced in civil\n\n        court.

In order to further appreciate the ruling of the\n\n        Supreme Court, in Bishwanath Tea Estate (supra), it would\n\n        be necessary to set out the some of the other facts involved.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_251\">                       218. Bishwanath Co. Ltd. had taken on lease land\n\n        measuring 1107.26 acres from the Government. The lease was\n\n        to be exploited for cultivation and raising tea-garden. The\n\n        manager of the company approached the appellant seeking\n\n        permission to cut 7000 cubic feet of timber from grant N.C.\n\n        Tezalpatty 1 of Nagshankar Mouza for utilising the same for\n\n        building of staff and labourer&#x27;s houses. By a reply, the appellant\n\n        noted that the timber was to be cut for constructing houses in\n\n        Partabghur and Dekorai Tea Estates and that it was necessary\n\n        to ascertain whether any of the aforementioned two tea estates\n\n        was situated within the grant evidenced by lease of N.C.\n\n        Tezalpatty 1. It was made clear that if it was not so, full royalty\n\n        will be payable by the company for cutting, felling and removing\n\n        timber. The manager, by his letter, informed the appellant that\n\n        as the lessee is Bishwanath Tea Co. Ltd., it can cut and fell\n\n        timber from any of its leased area to &#x27;be utilised for its purposes\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_141\">                                       116/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        in any other division. Therefore, the manager suggested that\n\n        the permit must be issued without insisting on payment of\n\n        royalty. The appellant, by his letter, informed the manager that\n\n        as the timber was required for use in Partabghur and Dekorai\n\n        Tea Estates, which were not within N.C. Tezalpatty Grant 1 of\n\n        Nagshankar Mouza from which timber was to be felled and cut,\n\n        full royalty will be payable on timber so cut and removed,\n\n        because it was to be utilised for the purpose unconnected with\n\n        the grant. For this assertion, the appellant relied upon a portion\n\n        of clause 2 of Part IV of the lease deed, dated September 27,\n\n        1932. Correspondence further ensued between the parties and,\n\n        ultimately, the respondent Company paid an amount of Rs\n\n        7069.37 as and by way of royalty under protest and, then, filed\n\n        a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_160\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution in the High Court\n\n        alleging that upon a true construction of the relevant clause of\n\n        the grant as also the proviso to Rule 37 of the Settlement\n\n        Rules, since the timber was required for the purpose connected\n\n        with the exploitation of the grant, the company, as lessee, was\n\n        entitled to cut and remove timber without payment of royalty\n\n        and, therefore, the recovery of royalty being not supported by\n\n        law, the appellant was liable to refund the same. The company\n\n        also prayed for a mandamus directing the appellant, who was\n\n        respondent in the High Court, to issue permits without insisting\n\n        on payment of royalty, whenever timber was to be cut from the\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_142\">                                       117/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        leased area for the purposes connected with the exploitation of\n\n        the grant.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_252\">                     219. The Supreme Court, on appreciation of facts,\n\n        found, in Bishwanath Tea Estate (supra), that the relief,\n\n        claimed by the respondent, was referable to nothing else but\n\n        the term of the lease viz. clause 2, Part IV and that a bare\n\n        perusal of clause 2 of Part IV of the indenture of lease and the\n\n        proviso to Rule 37 would, at a glance, show that the proviso\n\n        enables a grantee to take benefit of it by fulfilling certain\n\n        conditions, namely, by paying a reduced valuation representing\n\n        only the profit, which it is likely to derive from the use of timber\n\n        for purposes connected with the exploitation of the grant. It is,\n\n        thus, an enabling provision and the grantor of the lease may\n\n        permit this option to be enjoyed by the grantee. But whether\n\n        that has been done or not is always a question of fact. If the\n\n        pre-condition is satisfied, the benefit can be taken. That again is\n\n        a matter to be worked out by the parties to the indenture of\n\n        lease.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_253\">                     220.      The      Supreme      Court   held,   on   facts,   in\n\n        Bishwanath Tea Estate (supra), that it can be demonstrably\n\n        established that the respondent was trying to enforce, through\n\n        the writ petition, the right to remove timber without the liability\n\n        to pay royalty not under the proviso to Rule 37, which was\n\n        merely an enabling provision, but on the basis of the specific\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_143\">                                       118/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        term of lease agreed to between the parties.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_254\">                     221. The Supreme Court, in Bishwanath Tea Estate\n\n        (supra), held that ordinarily, where a breach of contract is\n\n        complained of, a party, complaining of such breach, may sue\n\n        for specific performance of the contract, if contract is capable of\n\n        being specifically performed, or the party may sue for damages.\n\n        Such a suit would, ordinarily, be cognizable by the civil court.\n\n        The High Court, in its extraordinary jurisdiction, would not\n\n        entertain a petition either for specific performance of contract\n\n        or for recovering damages. A right to relief, flowing from a\n\n        contract, has to be claimed in a civil court, where a suit for\n\n        specific performance of contract or for damages could be filed.\n\n        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"1159364\" id=\"span_144\">In this regard, the Supreme Court, in Bishwanth Tea Estate\n\n        (supra), relied upon the case of <a href=\"/doc/1159364/\" id=\"a_161\">Har Shankar v.

If the action of\n                        the State is related to contractual obligations or\n                        obligations arising out of the tort, the court may not\n                        ordinarily examine it unless the action has some\n                        public      law     character     attached   to       it.     Broadly\n                        speaking, the court will examine actions of State if\n                        they pertain to the public law domain and refrain\n                        from examining them if they pertain to the private\n                        law field.

In this case, the\n\n        appellant, M/s.

The structures, standing on the said land, were\n\n        used as a part of a rice mill. Pursuant to a Town Planning\n\n        Scheme of 1957, the plots were reconstituted and the port trust\n\n        framed a policy to let out the reconstituted plot to the person,\n\n        who was in occupation of the major portion of the plot. In terms\n\n        of this policy, the trust initiated eviction proceeding against the\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_163\">                                       126/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        appellant by giving them one month&#x27;s notice sometime in\n\n        October 1977.

If the decision, in Dwarkadas Marfatia (supra),\n\n         is carefully read, it becomes more than abundantly clear that\n\n         though at the first blush, the decision, in <a href=\"/doc/541216/\" id=\"a_219\">Radhakrishna</a>\n\n         (supra), appears to have laid down that the remedy of every\n\n         breach of contract lies in civil suits and writ jurisdiction would\n\n         never be applicable to enforce even constitutional obligations of\n\n         the State in contractual matters, the later decision of the Apex\n\n         Court, in Dwarkadas Marfatia (supra), clearly shows that\n\n         having considered the decision, in <a href=\"/doc/541216/\" id=\"a_220\">Radhakrishna</a> (supra), and\n\n         also the Constitution Bench decision, in <a href=\"/doc/730804/\" id=\"a_221\">Escorts Ltd.</a> (supra), it\n\n         has clearly held that there is no absolute bar to the exercise of\n\n         jurisdiction      under      <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_222\">Article        226</a>   in   a   contractual    matter,\n\n         particularly, when the act or conduct of the State or its\n\n         instrumentality is challenged on the anvil of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_223\">Article 14.</a></span></span></span> It is\n\n         also clear from Dwarkadas Marfatia (supra) that a writ court\n\n         will enforce even a contractual obligation of the State if the\n\n         breach of obligation by the State fails to satisfy the test of\n\n         reasonableness under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_224\">Article 14</a>, for, in such a case, what the\n\n         writ court would be enforcing is the constitutional duty of the\n\n         State, though such a duty might have arisen in the realm of\n\n         contractual obligation. It has been further made clear, in\n\n         Dwarkadas           Marfatia       (supra),       that     even   in   contractual\n\n         matters, the State&#x27;s action must be reasonable, lawful and on\n\n         relevant ground of public interest.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_269\"> Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_185\">                                       133/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_270\">                        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1527980\" id=\"span_186\">232. What emerges from the above discussion is\n\n         that when a writ petition is filed alleging breach of contractual\n\n         obligation by the State or its instrumentality, the High Court\n\n         shall    determine        whether           the    writ   petitioner    is   merely\n\n         demanding to enforce his contractual rights or he has raised\n\n         some important questions of law and/or constitutional issues. If\n\n         he aims at merely enforcing his contractual rights and raises no\n\n         important       question       of    law      or    constitutional     issue,   writ\n\n         jurisdiction will not be invoked; but if the writ petitioner raises\n\n         a constitutional issue, there is no absolute bar to the exercise\n\n         of jurisdiction under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_225\">Article 226</a> even in a contractual matter.\n\n         This position of law was made clear in <a href=\"/doc/1527980/\" id=\"a_226\">Life Insurance\n\n         Corporation of India v.

It\n                        is wide and expansive. The Constitution does not\n                        place any fetter on exercise of the extraordinary\n                        jurisdiction.

Therefore, it cannot be laid down as a\n                        general proposition of law that in no case the High\n                        Court can entertain a writ petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_228\">Article 226</a>\n                        of the Constitution to enforce a claim under a life\n                        insurance policy.

The determination of the question\n                        depends on consideration of several factors like,\n                        whether a writ petitioner is merely attempting to\n                        enforce his/her contractual rights or the case raises\n                        important         questions    of       law       and   constitutional\n                        issues, the nature of the dispute raised; the nature\n                        of    inquiry      necessary      for    determination        of   the\n                        dispute, etc. The matter is to be considered in the\n                        facts and circumstances of each case.

The courts have consistently\n                        taken      the     view       that      in    a    case   where    for\n                        determination of the dispute raised, it is necessary\n                        to inquire into the facts for determination of which it\n                        may become necessary to record oral&#x27; evidence, a\n                        proceeding under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_230\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution is\n                        not the appropriate forum. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1047783\" id=\"span_188\">The position is also well\n                        settled that if the contract entered between the\n                        parties provides an alternate forum for resolution of\n                        disputes arising from the contract, then the parties\n                        should approach the forum agreed by them and the\n                        High Court in writ jurisdiction should not permit\n                        them to bypass the agreed forum of dispute\n                        resolution.

This Court from\n                        time      to    time      disapproved        of    a   High    Court\n                        entertaining a petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_232\">Article 226</a> of the\n                        Constitution         in      matters    of        enforcement     of\n                        contractual rights and obligations particularly where\n                        the claim by one party is contested by the other and\n                        adjudication of the dispute requires inquiry into\n                        facts.

The     position      that    emerges        from     the\n\n         discussions in the decided cases is that, ordinarily, the High\n\n         Court should not entertain a writ petition, filed under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_235\">Article\n\n         226</a> of the Constitution, for mere enforcement of a claim under\n\n         a contract of insurance. Where an insurer has repudiated the\n\n         claim, in case such a writ petition is filed, the High Court has to\n\n         consider the facts and circumstances of the case, the nature of\n\n         the dispute raised and the nature of the inquiry necessary to be\n\n         made for determination of the questions raised and other\n\n         relevant factors before taking a decision whether it should\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_191\">                                       136/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n         entertain the writ petition or reject it as not maintainable. It\n\n         has also to be kept in mind that in case an insured or nominee\n\n         of the deceased insured is refused relief merely on the ground\n\n         that the claim relates to contractual rights and obligations and\n\n         he/she is driven to a long drawn litigation in the civil court it\n\n         will cause serious prejudice to the claimant/ other beneficiaries\n\n         of the policy. The pros and cons of the matter in the context of\n\n         the fact situation of the case should be carefully weighed and\n\n         appropriate decision should be taken. In a case where claim by\n\n         an insured or a nominee is repudiated raising a serious dispute\n\n         and the court finds the dispute to be a bona fide one which\n\n         requires oral and documentary evidence for its determination\n\n         then the appropriate remedy is a civil suit and not a writ\n\n         petition under <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_236\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution. Similarly, where\n\n         a plea of fraud is pleaded by the insurer and on examination is\n\n         found prima facie to have merit and oral and documentary\n\n         evidence may become necessary for determination of the issue\n\n         raised, then a writ petition is not an appropriate remedy.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_272\">                        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1527980\" id=\"span_192\">234.

No exercise of discretionary power can be\n\n         unfettered, unguided, unsettled or arbitrary, and, hence, the\n\n         position of law, on a given subject, should not be completely\n\n         unforeseen and legal decisions must have some standards or\n\n         parameters in order to enable the people at large to know as to\n\n         what the position of law, on a given subject, is.

While\n\n         jurisdiction of the High Court to entertain a writ petition, under\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/1712542/\" id=\"a_245\">Article 226</a> of the Constitution of India, cannot be denied\n\n         altogether, the courts must bear in mind the self-imposed\n\n         restrictions constitutionally followed by the High Courts not to,\n\n         ordinarily, entertain writ petitions for enforcement of purely\n\n         contractual        rights      and      obligations,    particularly,        when\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_197\">                                       139/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n         determination of such questions necessitates taking of oral\n\n         evidence or when the parties had agreed to resolve their\n\n         disputes arising out of the contract, in the alternative forum\n\n         selected by them.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_275\">                        <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1261492\" id=\"span_198\">237.

The Preamble of the Constitution of India resolves\n                     to secure, to all its citizens, justice, social, economic\n                     and political and equality of status and opportunity.\n                     Every State action must be aimed at achieving this\n                     goal. Part IV of the Constitution contains &#x27;Directive\n                     Principles of State Policy&#x27; which are fundamental in the\n                     governance of the country and are aimed at securing\n                     social and economic freedoms by appropriate State\n                     action       which       is     complementary     to   individual\n                     fundamental rights guaranteed in Part III for protection\n                     against excesses of State action, to realise the vision in\n                     the    Preamble.        This    being   the   philosophy   of   the\n                     Constitution, can it be said that it contemplates\n                     exclusion of Article 14non-arbitrariness which is basic\n                     to rule of law from State actions in contractual field\n                     when all actions of the State are meant for public good\n                     and expected to be fair and just? We have no doubt\n                     that the Constitution does not envisage or permit\n                     unfairness or unreasonableness in State actions in any\n                     sphere of its activity contrary to the professed ideals in\n                     the Preamble. In our opinion, it would be alien to the\n                     constitutional scheme to accept the argument of\n                     exclusion of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_267\">Article 14</a> in contractual matters. The\n                     scope and permissible grounds of judicial review in\n                     such matters and the relief which may be available are\n                     different matters but that does not justify the view of\n                     its total exclusion. This is more so when the modern\n                     trend is also to examine the unreasonableness of a\n                     term in such contracts where the bargaining power is\n                     unequal so that these are not negotiated contracts but\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_215\">                                         144/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n                     standard form contracts between unequals.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_96\">                     22. There is an obvious difference in the contracts\n                     between private parties and contracts to which the\n                     State is a party. Private parties are concerned only with\n                     their    personal        interest       whereas      the      State    while\n                     exercising its powers and discharging its functions acts\n                     indubitably, as is expected of it, for public good and in\n                     public interest. The impact of every State action is also\n                     on public interest. This factor alone is sufficient to\n                     import at least the minimal requirements of public law\n                     obligations        and        impress    with    this      character    the\n                     contracts made by the State or its instrumentality. It is\n                     a different matter that the scope of judicial review in\n                     respect      of     disputes      falling   within      the    domain     of\n                     contractual obligations may be more limited and in\n                     doubtful      cases      the     parties    may      be     relegated     to\n                     adjudication of their rights by resort to remedies\n                     provided          for   adjudication        of    purely       contractual\n                     disputes. However, to the extent, challenge is made on\n                     the ground of violation of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_268\">Article 14</a> by alleging that the\n                     impugned act is arbitrary, unfair or unreasonable, the\n                     fact that the dispute also falls within the domain of\n                     contractual obligations would not relieve the State of\n                     its obligation to comply with the basic requirements of\n                     <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_269\">Article 14.</a> To this extent, the obligation is of a public\n                     character invariably in every case irrespective of there\n                     being any other right or obligation in addition thereto.\n                     An additional contractual obligation cannot divest the\n                     claimant of the guarantee under <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_270\">Article 14</a> of non-\n                     arbitrariness at the hands of the State in any of its\n                     actions.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_97\">                     23.

It is really the nature of its\n                     personality as State which is significant and must\n                     characterize all its actions, in whatever field, and not\n                     the nature of function, contractual or otherwise, which\n                     is decisive of the nature of scrutiny permitted for\n                     examining the validity of its act. The requirement of\n                     <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_273\">Article 14</a> being the duty to act fairly, justly and\n                     reasonably, there is nothing which militates against the\n                     concept of requiring the State always to so act, even in\n                     contractual         matters.        There   is   a   basic   difference\n                     between the acts of the State which must invariably be\n                     in public interest and those of a private individual,\n                     engaged        in    similar    activities,      being   primarily   for\n                     personal gain, which may or may not promote public\n                     interest. Viewed in this manner, in which we find no\n                     conceptual difficulty or anachronism, we find no reason\n                     why the requirement of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_274\">Article 14</a> should not extend\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_217\">                                       146/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n                     even in the sphere of contractual matters for regulating\n                     the conduct of the State activity.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_99\">                     28. Even assuming that it is necessary to import the\n                     concept of presence of some public element in a State\n                     action to attract <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_275\">Article 14</a> and permit judicial review,\n                     we have no hesitation in saying that the ultimate\n                     impact of all actions of the State or a public body being\n                     undoubtedly on public interest, the requisite public\n                     element for this purpose is present also in contractual\n                     matters. We, therefore, find it difficult and unrealistic\n                     to exclude the State actions in contractual matters,\n                     after the contract has been made, from the purview of\n                     judicial review to test its validity on the anvil of Article\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_218\">                     14.</span>\n\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_100\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1281050\" id=\"span_219\">29.

It is\n                     obvious that the conclusion on the facts of the case\n                     could not be reached by Ranganathan, J. without\n                     examining them and this could be done only on the\n                     basis that it was permissible to make the judicial\n                     review.

However, where no\n                     plausible reason or principle is indicated nor is it\n                     discernible and the impugned State action, therefore,\n                     appears to be ex facie arbitrary, the initial burden to\n                     prove the arbitrariness is discharged shifting onus on\n                     the State to justify its action as fair and reasonable. If\n                     the State is unable to produce material to justify its\n                     action as fair and reasonable, the burden on the person\n                     alleging arbitrariness must be held to be discharged.\n                     The scope of judicial review is limited as indicated in\n                     <a href=\"/doc/1058612/\" id=\"a_288\">Dwarkadas Marfatia</a> case to oversee the State action\n                     for the purpose of satisfying that it is not vitiated by\n                     the vice of arbitrariness and no more. The wisdom of\n                     the policy or the lack of it or the desirability of a better\n                     alternative is not within the permissible scope of\n                     judicial review in such cases.

In this regard the appellants had approached the\n\n        respondent, Export Credit Guarantee Corporation of India Ltd,\n\n        (EGCIL, in short) for a risk cover, which was granted. Later on,\n\n        upon the failure of Kazakhstan Government to fulfil its\n\n        guarantee, the appellants made a claim before the first\n\n        respondent, which had covered the said risk of compensating\n\n        the loss. EGCIL, however, repudiated the claim on the ground\n\n        that the appellants had changed the terms of the contract of\n\n        payment without first consulting it and, therefore, it had no\n\n        obligation to compensate the appellants for the loss suffered by\n\n        it.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_290\">                     250.

The learned Single Judge\n\n        came to the conclusion that though the dispute between the\n\n        parties arose out of a contract, EGCIL, being a State for the\n\n        purpose of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_298\">Article 12</a>, was bound by the terms of the contract\n\n        and,     therefore,      a    writ    was    maintainable   for   such   non-\n\n        performance, and, upon considering the arguments of the\n\n        parties, with regard to the liability under the contract of\n\n        insurance, allowed the writ petition and issued the writ and\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_235\">                                       153/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        directions as prayed for by the appellants in the writ petition.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_291\">                     251.

In the Supreme Court, EGCIL carried the same\n\n        arguments on which the Division Bench of the Calcutta High\n\n        Court had ruled. It was argued that the subject-matter is a\n\n        dispute arising out of a contract and is not a matter falling\n\n        under the purview of administrative law. It was also argued that\n\n        the doctrine of fairness and reasonableness applies only in the\n\n        exercise of statutory or administrative actions of a State and\n\n        not in the exercise of a contractual obligation and issues, arising\n\n        out of contractual matters, will have to be decided on the basis\n\n        of the law of contract and not on the basis of the administrative\n\n        law. It was further argued that at the most, in matters,\n\n        involving statutory contracts, where action of the State involves\n\n        a public duty, a writ may lie; but in the instant case, the\n\n        contract was neither a statutory contract nor did the duty of the\n\n        EGCIL, under the contract, have any public law element\n\n        involved in it.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_293\"> Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_236\">                                       154/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_294\">                     253.

Later, due to\n\n         complaints against the promoter of the company, the appellant\n\n         refused to advance the loan on the ground that loan was\n\n         dependent on refinance, by the Industrial Development Bank of\n\n         India and since the said Bank has refused to refinance it would\n\n         not be possible to advance the loan to the respondent.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_304\">                        261.

It further held that there cannot be any\n\n        doubt whatsoever that <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_343\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India,\n\n        which encompasses, within its fold, obligations on the part of\n\n        the State to act fairly, operates also in the contractual field.</span>\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_318\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1894467\" id=\"span_271\">269. The other important aspect of the case of\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1894467/\" id=\"a_344\">Manubhai Dharmasinhbhai Gajera</a> (supra) was that the\n\n        Supreme Court analysed several previous cases of Supreme\n\n        Court, which dealt with the issue of contractual obligations of\n\n        State.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_319\">                     270.         Among       the    various   cases   analyzing,   in\n\n        Manubhai Dharmasinhbhai Gajera (supra), one was the\n\n        case of Excise Commissioner vs. lssac Peter, (1994) 4 SCC\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_320\">        450. It was pointed out that a bare perusal of the decision\n\n        would show that the same was rendered in the context of\n\n        contracts entered into between the State and its citizens\n\n        pursuant to public auction of tenders or by negotiation. The\n\n        respondents therein sought to get new term incorporated in the\n\n        contract on the specious plea of fairness. The said plea was\n\n        rightly rejected. The fact, however, remains that the ratio, in\n\n        Issac (supra), is not applicable to the facts of the present case\n\n        not because the duty to act fairly on the part of a State has no\n\n        application in the field of a contract, but the same would not\n\n        apply for the purpose of alterations or modifications of a term of\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_272\">                                       163/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_321\">                     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1894467\" id=\"span_273\">271. Elaborating further, on the contention that the\n\n        writ court would, ordinarily, not grant specific performance of a\n\n        contract even if it is found that there exists a renewal clause or\n\n        there has been a breach of contract on the part of the appellant\n\n        the Supreme Court observed, in <a href=\"/doc/1894467/\" id=\"a_345\">Manubhai Dharmasinhbhai\n\n        Gajera</a> (supra), that, ordinarily, it is so.

It is clearly discernible, from the admitted facts\n\n        of the present case, that when the writ petitioner raised\n\n        concerns about the prohibition on mining in Bihar, which would\n\n        have      had    material      financial     impact     on   the   project,   the\n\n        respondent No.4 wrote a letter to the Collector, Sasaram, to\n\n        consider the request of the writ petitioner as a special case by\n\n        relaxing the provisions under Rule 36 of the Rules under the\n\n        Mines &amp; Minerals (Dеvеlорmеnt &amp; Regulation) Act, 1957. This\n\n        letter, by the respondent No. 4, is, in fact, an acknowledgment\n\n        of the concerns of the writ petitioner. However, as things rolled\n\n        out later, the letter (Annexure 32), was never pursued seriously\n\n        by the respondents as a result of which a situation arose, when\n\n        the writ petitioner had to, in the interest of project, fetch\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_313\">                                       175/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        aggregates from outside the State of Bihar. The writ petitioner\n\n        needed an assurance from the respondents that the additional\n\n        cost of more than Rs 400 crores would be re-imbursed by the\n\n        respondents. It may be pointed out that quantification of\n\n        additional cost was not done by the writ petitioner himself;\n\n        rather, such quantification was done by Independent Engineer,\n\n        Intercontinental Consultants and Technocrat Pvt. Ltd, appointed\n\n        by the respondents. It may also be pointed out that at no point\n\n        of time, the figure of Rs 435 crores, as additional cost, was ever\n\n        disputed by the respondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_352\">                     290.

As against Serial No. 3, the discussion/\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_314\">                                       176/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        decision reached, with respect to payment of extra lead of\n\n        aggregates, was recorded and it would be seen from the\n\n        minutes that contrary to the commitment, made before,\n\n        respondent stated that that there was no provision of extra lead\n\n        aggregate in the Concessional Agreement and the claim for\n\n        extra lead of aggregate had already been rejected. The\n\n        respondents, therefore, as is apparent, changed their stance so\n\n        far as the re-imbursement for additional cost for extra lead of\n\n        aggregates is concerned. It may be pointed out at this juncture\n\n        that no specific reason was assigned in the meeting, dated\n\n        5.8.2014, to explain the departure from the earlier stand.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_354\">                     292. In view of the stance of the respondents, the\n\n        writ petitioner invoked the rights conferred by the Concession\n\n        Agreement, particular1y, Article 37.2.2, bringing to the notice\n\n        of the respondents to cure the defaults      and issues within a\n\n        period of 90 days. Among the various defaults and issues\n\n        raised, by the writ petitioner, the default and issue, with respect\n\n        to serial No. 1, was concern as to non-payment of additional\n\n        cost incurred for the procurement of aggregates from longer\n\n        leads amounting to Rs 5.63 crores till date. In the review\n\n        meeting, dated 4.9.2014, which followed the Notice to cure\n\n        issued by the writ petitioner, the first item of the meeting was\n\n        regarding the Notice, under Clause 37.2, served by the writ\n\n        petitioner upon the respondents.

The minutes also reveal\n\n        that respondents advised the writ petitioner to withdraw the\n\n        notice,     which      the    writ    petitioner    agreed   subject   to   the\n\n        recommendation of the proposal of extra lead by the Authority\n\n        to the Govt. of B1har.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_355\">                     293.      In    the     meeting,      dated   06.11.2014,      vide\n\n        Annexure 8, the respondents made an explicit promise to the\n\n        writ petitioner to cure all the issues (i.e., defects) raised by the\n\n        writ petitioner and further requested the writ petitioner not to\n\n        terminate the contract.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_356\">                     294. However, as the time passed by and no headway\n\n        was being made on the request of the writ petitioner for\n\n        payment of additional cost, even though the writ petitioner had\n\n        been incurring additional cost for procurement of aggregates\n\n        from neighbouring States, on the promise made by the\n\n        respondents, the lenders of the writ petitioner held a meeting\n\n        with the writ petitioner in the presence of the respondent No. 8.\n\n        In this meeting the respondent No. 8, as Annexure 36 explains,\n\n        revealed that it is the responsibility of the Company (i.e., the\n\n        writ petitioner) to arrange the aggregates.

The options, available to the respondents, on the\n\n        receipt of the Notice of Intent to Terminate the Agreement, was\n\n        either to cure the defaults or to dispute the notice. However,\n\n        rather than curing the defaults or disputing the Notice of Intent\n\n        to Terminate, the respondents, as is apparent from Annexure-\n\n        12, admitted the default and chose to take the following-up\n\n        action under <a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_393\">Article 37.4</a> of the Concession Agreement. The\n\n        opening lines of <a href=\"/doc/76375/\" id=\"a_394\">Article 37.4</a> reads as follows;\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_126\">                        &quot;Upon Termination for any reason whatsoever, the\n                        Authority shall&quot;\n</blockquote>\n\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_359\">                         297. It is, thus, clear that the respondents, too,\n\n         agreed to terminate the agreement instead of choosing to\n\n         contest the claims made by the writ petitioner and that is\n\n         precisely the reason that they opted for the follow-up action\n\n         needed to be taken by the Authority, when the agreement\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_317\">                                        179/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n         stands terminated.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_360\">                     298.

Quarrying     is   the   act   of   removal   of\n\n        aggregates from the quarry; but despite repeated applications\n\n        from the writ petitioner, the respondents had done nothing to\n\n        allow quarrying, in the State of Bihar, by granting mining lease;\n\n        rather, they directed the writ petitioner to bring aggregates\n\n        from outside the State of Bihar, which the writ petitioner did.\n\n        The respondents, thus, as an afterthought, sought to create a\n\n        confusion over the meaning of quarrying leaving the writ\n\n        petitioner to burden the issue of procuring aggregates.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_364\">                     302. A further reading of paragraph 3.1 of Annexure\n\n        16 would show that respondents contended that by then, the\n\n        Government of Bihar, had, vide Notification no. 3085/M, Patna,\n\n        dated 11.08.2014, opened the mining lease for procurement of\n\n        aggregates, but even then, the writ petitioner had not made\n\n        any efforts for procurement of aggregates.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_365\">                     303.

In fact, it would not\n\n        be proper to even suggest that writ petitioner had not put up\n\n        efforts to get a mining lease within the State of Bihar.

It, thus, emerges that the plea of lifting of\n\n        prohibition on mining and alleging the writ petitioner of not\n\n        putting up efforts to get an allotment of mining lease was taken\n\n        only with a view to subvert the Notice of Intent to Terminate\n\n        issued by the writ petitioner by misrepresenting the facts.

The writ petitioner extended the validity of the Bid\n\n        for one month. In the meantime, the file for projects State VGF\n\n        (Viability Gap Funding) share, for theoretical consent was with\n\n        the     Finance        Department,           and,   therefore,    BSRDC,       the\n\n        respondents herein, requested the writ petitioner to extend the\n\n        validity of the Bid for next two months.

The writ petitioner was, again, requested to extend the\n\n        Bid validity for the third time, which the writ petitioner complied\n\n        by extending the Bid by one more month. On the fourth\n\n        occasion,       when      the    writ     petitioner   extended   its   Bid,   its\n\n        extension, on 16.06.2011 was subject, admittedly, to the\n\n        granting of the mining lease. It is further revealed from the\n\n        Annexure 35 that, as the proceedings for approval of the project\n\n        were at the final stage before the Govt of Bihar, the respondents\n\n        further requested the writ petitioner to extend the Bid, which\n\n        writ petitioner did.

The opinion of the Principal Additional Advocate\n\n        General, in his letter, dated 28.10.2014, also contains a\n\n        reference to the approval by the State Cabinet. In this regard,\n\n        Clause (d) to Article 37.2.1 provided that if the State commits a\n\n        material default in complying with the provisions of the State\n\n        Support Agreement and if such default has a Material adverse\n\n        effect on the Concessionaire and the breach continues for a\n\n        period of 90 days from the date of notice given, in this behalf, by\n\n        the Concessionaire to the Authority, the Concessionaire shall be\n\n        entitled to terminate the agreement.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_382\">                     311.      Mining       plots      were   exclusively   under     the\n\n        possession        of    State     and        mining   was   essential   for   the\n\n        construction of the project. If mining was prohibited, then, the\n\n        State Government should have either allowed mining within the\n\n        State of Bihar, in the interest of the project, or could have\n\n        granted permission for additional cost likely to be incurred by\n\n        the writ petitioner. However, despite seeking several extensions\n\n        of bid from the writ petitioner, and, eventually, approving the\n\n        project with the knowledge of the conditions of mining set out by\n\n        the writ petitioner, the State Government continued to sit idle\n\n        over the matter, that too, with respect to a project involving\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_326\">                                       187/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        huge amount of money. In Annexure 19, the Termination Notice,\n\n        issued by the writ petitioner, it has been categorically mentioned\n\n        that in view of the delay in the decision as to payment of\n\n        additional cost, it would be impossible to complete the project\n\n        and commence toll collection from 15.3.2016, the agreed date,\n\n        on the basis of which entire financial viability of the project was\n\n        worked out.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_383\">                     312. Thus, the Govt. of Bihar, by not taking decision\n\n        on the payment of additional cost, not only materially and\n\n        adversely affected the project, but also put the writ petitioner to\n\n        risk of committing a default in not completing the project in\n\n        time. Seen from the perspective of Clause 37.1.1 (e) of the\n\n        Concession agreement, such a delay could have been a ground\n\n        for the Authority to terminate the agreement, that too, for no\n\n        fault of the writ petitioner. It may be pointed out here, as\n\n        submitted by the learned Senior Counsel for the writ petitioner,\n\n        that if the writ petitioner would not have agitated the issue of\n\n        additional cost of aggregates, from the longer leads, the project\n\n        would have gone in indeterminate state since the financial close\n\n        of Rs 1200 crores did not include the additional cost of Rs 435\n\n        crores for procurement of aggregates from longer leads. Hence,\n\n        it is evident that, apart from the actions of respondent\n\n        Corporation,         even      the     action   of   State   Government   is\n\n        undoubtedly unfair, unreasonable, arbitrary and, therefore,\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_327\">                                        188/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        violative of <a href=\"/doc/367586/\" id=\"a_399\">Article 14</a> of the Constitution of India.\n\n        WHETHER THE WRIT PETITION DISCLOSES DISPUTED\n        QUESTIONS OF FACT?\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_384\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_385\">                       313.

Though, in the present case there is no question of\n\n        illegality of contract as the contract was lawfully entered into but\n\n        the fact remains that the respondents have received the benefits\n\n        of the work done by the appellant, i.e. construction of road by\n\n        procuring aggregates from outside the State of Bihar. In these\n\n        circumstances, when the appellant was allowed to execute the\n\n        contract, in question, it will be highly iniquitous not to let the\n\n        respondents compensate the appellant for the benefits, which\n\n        the respondents have derived, because of the execution of the\n\n        contract by the appellant.

The learned single Judge, in paragraph 12 of his\n\n        judgment, has held that &quot;on merits of the present case, this\n\n        Court finds no error in the action of the petitioner in\n\n        issuing the termination notice and the Respondent&#x27;s\n\n        contention that the petitioner ought to have first opted for\n\n        arbitration cannot be accepted&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_401\">                                                      (Emphasis is added)\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_402\">                     328. Thus, the learned single Judge has held that not\n\n        only the termination notice of the petitioner is proper, but the\n\n        contention of the respondents that petitioner ought to have\n\n        taken recourse to arbitration, too, did not find favour with the\n\n        learned single Judge. In this regard, while going through the\n\n        findings of my learned brother, I notice that this finding of the\n\n        learned single Judge has not been disturbed in any manner.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_403\">                     329. The learned single Judge, having held that\n\n        termination of the notice by the appellant is proper, has,\n\n        however, held that so far as quantification of termination\n\n        amount is concerned, the same would require adducing of\n\n        evidence and investigation of facts. Such an observation seems\n\n        to have been upheld by my learned brother, though the\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_337\">                                       195/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        materials on record make it, to my mind, amply clear that even\n\n        the amount is not in dispute, or to be more precise, the\n\n        termination amount has been admitted.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_404\">                     330. Now, it is an admitted position that at the time of\n\n        entering into agreement, mining operations were prohibited in\n\n        the State of Bihar and that is why, the bid of the appellant was\n\n        conditional that mining would be permitted. The conditional bid\n\n        was approved on 2.8.2011 by the State Cabinet. A\n\n        reference to the Cabinet approval is found in Annexure 35 and\n\n        Annexure 26, the contents whereof have not been in dispute.\n\n        The Concession Agreement signed by the parties contains all the\n\n        correspondences regarding the conditional bid and allotment of\n\n        mines.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_405\">                     331. I, therefore, find myself in disagreement with the\n\n        observation made by my learned brother that there was no\n\n        stipulation in the Concession Agreement that mining lease would\n\n        be granted to the appellant for execution of work. My learned\n\n        brother has incorporated the provisions of <a href=\"/doc/609139/\" id=\"a_408\">Article 12</a> of the\n\n        Agreement,         which      specifically   provides    that   prior   to   the\n\n        commencement of works, the Concessionaire shall make its own\n\n        arrangements for quarrying the materials needed for the project\n\n        highway.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_406\">                     332. <a href=\"/doc/624769/\" id=\"a_409\">Article 12.1 (d)</a> provided that the appellant shall\n\n        quarry      the    materials      needed     for   the   project   highway    in\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_338\">                                       196/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        accordance with applicable laws and applicable permits. The act\n\n        of quarrying, as agreed, was the sole responsibility of the\n\n        appellant; but such an act of quarrying was subject to applicable\n\n        laws and permits. Since, admittedly, mining operations stood\n\n        prohibited at the relevant point of time, the question arose as\n\n        regards procuring materials from outside the State of Bihar\n\n        requiring additional cost. It is not the case of the Corporation\n\n        that even for mining operation in Bihar, the appellant was asking\n\n        for additional cost. In this regard, when the matter was referred\n\n        to Independent Engineers, appointed by the Corporation, they,\n\n        too, gave an opinion, vide Annexure 6, that BSRDC, the\n\n        respondents herein, may take a decision either to impress upon\n\n        the State Government to allow mining or re-imburse the\n\n        additional cost of Rs 410.13 crores based on SOR-8th edition of\n\n        Road Construction Department, Bihar. The mining operations in\n\n        Bihar was, admittedly, never allowed to the appellant.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_407\">                     333. My learned brother has, while referring to\n\n        Annexure 2, held that Annexure 2 does not contain any\n\n        admission on the part of the respondents permitting the\n\n        appellant to procure aggregates from outside the State of Bihar\n\n        in view of the mining prohibitions in the State of Bihar and has\n\n        further held that since Annexure 2 does not contain the\n\n        signatures of the respondents, it cannot form basis of any\n\n        assurance. While considering Annexure 2, it needs to be\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_339\">                                       197/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n        carefully noted that the contents and contentions embodied in\n\n        Annexure-2 have never been in dispute between the parties\n\n        concerned and, therefore, I am unable to fall in agreement with\n\n        my learned brother that Annexure 2 does not contain an\n\n        admission. It is apparent from Annexure 6, the notice issued by\n\n        the appellant to the respondents for curing the defects/defaults,\n\n        that till 31.7.2014, the appellant had already incurred an\n\n        expenditure of Rs 5.63 cores for procuring aggregates from\n\n        outside      the    State     of    Bihar.   This   amount   went   upto   Rs\n\n        9,15,20,314/- as can be seen from Annexure 11. In my\n\n        considered view, therefore, the conduct of the respondents in\n\n        not prohibiting the appellant from incurring expenditures goes to\n\n        show that the respondents wanted the appellant to go ahead\n\n        with the assurance. Hence, Annexure 2 has to be treated as\n\n        clear admission on the part of the respondents that in view of\n\n        the requirement to complete the project in time and also in view\n\n        of the mining prohibitions, they had allowed the appellant to\n\n        procure aggregates from longer leads. The absence of signatures\n\n        of respondents in Annexure 2 is of little importance since the\n\n        respondents have not disputed the document, Annexure 2,\n\n        and/or the conditions therefor. This apart even Annexure 33,\n\n        which is also a minute relied upon by the appellant, bears only\n\n        the signature of respondents.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_408\">                     334.

On that day, the principal amount outstanding to\n\n         Senior lenders of the appellant was Rs 248.49 crores, which, at\n\n         the time of filing of writ petition, was Rs 3,08,28,18,389/- vide,\n\n         Annexure I.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_413\">                         338. It is also pertinent to point out that the\n\n         Independent         Engineers       were    directed   by   the   respondents\n\n         themselves to visit the appellant‟s headquarter along with the\n\n         Concurrent Auditor, appointed by the respondents, for the\n\n         scrutiny of papers related to VGF grants and to submit a\n\n         scrutinized report by 15.9.2014. The VGF grant is based on\n\n         equity and debt by the banks. The Independent Engineers and\n\n         the Concurrent Auditors scrutinized the accounts of the appellant\n\n         at the appellant‟s headquarters as can be seen from the\n\n         minutes, dated 6.11.2014, and after all these compliances, the\n\n         respondents decided to process the release of grant by the State\n\n         and the Central government. This would mean that the debt\n\n         amount and equity amount has been verified and were found to\n\n         be true as can be seen from the minutes of the meetings, dated\n\n         04.09.2014 and 06.11.2014, Annexure 7 and 8, respectively.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_414\">                         339.

If the\n\n         equity amount is Rs 202 crore, then, 150% of 202 crore comes\n\n         to Rs 303 crore. Thus, the figure of Rs 602 crores is sum total of\n\n         figures of Rs 303 crores and 248.49 crore along with interest.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_415\">                         340. The case of the appellant is, thus, not based on\n\n         the report of Independent Engineer alone, but also on the\n\n         scrutiny of the Independent Engineer and the Concurrent\n\n         Auditor as per minutes, dated 4.9.2014 and 6.11.2014, and the\n\n         unequivocal admissions of the respondents about the equity and\n\n         debt, while recommending release of grant to the Government\n\n         of India read with confirmation letter of the lenders.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_416\">                         341. Thus, if the finding of the learned single Judge\n\n         that appellants had rightly terminated the agreement has been\n\n         upheld, the denial of relief on the grounds that termination\n\n         payment would require adducing evidence and investigation of\n\n         facts is not borne out of records. Such quantification is simple\n\n         arithmetic based on agreed formula. In any view the matter, the\n\n         respondents have never disputed the computation method as\n\n         projected by the appellant. No question of any agreement on the\n\n         binding force of Independent Engineers‟ report arises for the\n\n         reason that it is nobody‟s case. However, what is binding is\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_343\">                                       201/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n         Article 37.3.2, which deals with the method of computation of\n\n         termination payment in the event of Authority default. That\n\n         there has been an authority default has already been affirmed in\n\n         the findings of learned Single Judge in para 12 of the judgment,\n\n         while holding that &quot;on merits of the present case, this Court\n\n         finds no error in the action of the petitioner in issuing the\n\n         termination notice&quot;.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_417\">\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_418\">                         342. Now, so far as quantification of amount,\n\n         mentioned in the writ petition, is concerned, the computation\n\n         method as stated in Article 37.3.2 is admitted. The components\n\n         required for computations are also admitted. The debt due is\n\n         admitted to be Rs 3,08,28,18,389/- vide Annexure I. The equity\n\n         amount is also admitted to be Rs 202 Crore. The computation of\n\n         150 % of adjusted equity done by the appellant have never\n\n         been disputed by the respondents ─ be it in the original hearing\n\n         or in the appellate hearing. Thus, 150% of 202 crore comes to\n\n         Rs 303 crore. The sum total of admitted amounts of Rs\n\n         3,08,28,18,389/-           and      Rs      303   crores   comes   to   Rs\n\n         6,11,28,18,389. It is seen that appellant has claimed amount\n\n         lesser than the figures arrived at by applying the formula and\n\n         this is so, because the debt due figure is required to be\n\n         computed with reference to Wholesale Price Index. According to\n\n         the appellant, 150% of 202 Crores with reference to Wholesale\n\n         Price Index, comes to Rs 3,02,24,54,344 and the total of Rs\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_344\">                                       202/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n         3,08,28,18,389 and 3,02,24,54,344 comes to Rs 6,105,272,733.\n\n         Such a method of computation does not adducing of evidence\n\n         nor does it call for any investigation of facts.

So long as this Constitutional\n\n         provision remains, Parliament cannot enact a law authorising\n\n         courts to inquire into as to what advice the Council of Ministers\n\n         had tendered to the President, for, such a statutory provision\n Patna High Court LPA No.2158 of 2015 dt.12-05-2016\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_349\">                                       207/208</span>\n\n\n\n\n         will not be permissible in the face of the embargo imposed by\n\n         <a href=\"/doc/635602/\" id=\"a_416\">Article 74(2).</a> However, in respect of those privileges, which the\n\n         Constitution do not specifically bar, the Legislature has the\n\n         discretion of waiving or not claiming. The Legislature, therefore,\n\n         may, by enacting law, give up its privilege. This fundamental\n\n         aspect of the scope of &quot;privilege&quot; has to be kept in mind in\n\n         deciding the question, which the Court is concerned with.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_437\">                     349. In the present case, too, no privilege has been\n\n         claimed by the learned Principal Additional Advocate General,\n\n         who gave the opinion and who himself argued the case. This\n\n         apart, the legal opinion has been referred to in several other\n\n         correspondences precisely in para 14 of Annexure 26 and\n\n         Annexure 35. In these circumstances, the legal opinion,\n\n         tendered by the learned Principal Additional Advocate General,\n\n         loses the touch of any confidentiality or privilege.\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_438\">                     350. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1334962\" id=\"span_350\">In the words of Justice Bhagawati, in the case of\n\n        <a href=\"/doc/1334962/\" id=\"a_417\">Hindustan Sugar Mills vs State of Rajasthan</a> (AIR 1981 SC\n\n        1681), in a democratic society governed by the rule of law, it is\n\n        the duty of the State to do what is fair and just to the citizen and\n\n        the State should not seek to defeat the legitimate claim of its\n\n        citizen by adopting a legalistic attitude, but should do what\n\n        fairness and justice demand.</span>\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_439\">                     351.
