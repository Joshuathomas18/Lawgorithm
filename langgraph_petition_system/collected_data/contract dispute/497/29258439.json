Pass an order in favour of the Plaintiffs directing the\n           Defendants to pay costs as incurred by the Plaintiffs.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_2\">2.     The case of the Plaintiff is that it runs a chain of salons in India and\nrenders hair and beauty services. Defendant (including its predecessor) and\nthe Plaintiffs entered into an arrangement for promoting sale and distribution\nof the products of the Defendant in the Plaintiffs&#x27; salons. The following\nagreements were entered into between the parties;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_3\">     a) Memorandum of Understanding dated 27th April, 2010 (MOU)\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_4\">     b) Memorandum of Agreement dated 26th July, 2010\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_5\">     c) Amendatory Agreement dated 1st November, 2012\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_6\">     d) Amendatory Agreement dated 24th October, 2015.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_7\">3.     Pursuant to the above Agreements between the parties, the Plaintiff\nwas to order, purchase and take delivery of the Defendant&#x27;s cosmetic\nproducts. Various payments were also to be made by the Defendant to the\nPlaintiff for each of the salons established by the Plaintiffs and each of the\nstudios to be established by the Plaintiff. Apart from that, Defendant was to\nalso supply its products to the Plaintiff on a discount.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_8\">4.     In terms of the agreement, the Plaintiff had executed two Bank\nGuarantees for the sum of Rs.15,50,00,000/- and Rs.11,00,00,000/- in favour\nof Defendant No.2. The said Bank Guarantees are alleged to have been\nissued by the Bank after taking properties of Plaintiff No.2, who is a director\nof the Plaintiff No.1 Company, as security. The initially issued Bank\nGuarantees were subsequently amended on 28th December, 2017 and the\nnew Bank Guarantees were issued for a sum of Rs.9,50,00,000/- and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_2\">CS (COMM) 1251/2018                                                     Page 2 of 16</span>\n Rs.9,00,00,000/-. Both the said Bank Guarantees were extended till 21st\nSeptember, 2019. Various disputes arose between the parties in respect of\nthe payments, which were to be made by the Defendant to the Plaintiff and\nthe Plaintiff to Defendant. It is the case of the Plaintiffs that the Defendant\nowes a sum of Rs.1,00,80,003/- to the Plaintiff. In view of the various\ndisputes, which arose in respect of the payments, it is the case of the\nPlaintiffs that meetings were held between the parties in order to resolve the\ndispute. The last meeting was held on 25th October, 2018. The minutes of\nthe said meeting are claimed to have been captured in the email dated 15th\nNovember, 2018 written by the Defendant. According to the Plaintiff, an\nagreement was reached as to the manner in which the disputes between the\nparties were to be resolved.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_9\">5.      Subsequent to the receipt of this email, the Plaintiff states that it made\na payment of Rs.15 lakhs to the Defendant. Despite this, the Defendant\ninvoked the two Bank Guarantees on 20th November, 2018. Hence, the\npresent suit has been filed by the Plaintiff seeking an injunction against the\ninvocation and release of payments by the Bank to the Defendant.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_10\">6.      The suit was first listed on urgent mentioning at 4:15 pm on 26th\nNovember, 2018. The Plaintiff was directed to serve the Defendants and the\nmatter was taken up as the first item on 27 th November, 2018. The Bank and\nthe Defendant were duly represented. Submissions by Counsels were heard\non behalf of all parties.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_11\">7.      Mr. Sandeep Sethi, Learned Senior Counsel, appearing on behalf of\nthe Defendant has raised two preliminary objections.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_12\">      First, that this Court lacks territorial jurisdiction to entertain and try\n        the present suit and\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_3\">CS (COMM) 1251/2018                                                     Page 3 of 16</span>\n       Secondly, that there is an arbitration clause in the Memorandum of\n       Agreement dated 26th July, 2010 and thus, in any event a civil suit is\n       not maintainable. In support, he relies on the following judgments:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1549410\" id=\"span_4\"><a href=\"/doc/1549410/\" id=\"a_1\">a) South East Asia Shipping Co.

It is further submitted on merits that at the time when the meeting was\nheld on 25th October, 2018, it was not disclosed to the Defendant that\nliquidation proceedings had been commenced under the Insolvency and\nBankruptcy Code, 2016 (hereinafter, „IBC‟) against the Plaintiff no.1. It is\nsubmitted that even as per the e-mail which is admitted between the parties,\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">CS (COMM) 1251/2018                                                  Page 4 of 16</span>\n there is a huge amount of outstanding against the Plaintiff, which is to the\ntune of more than Rs.56 crores and hence there is a reasonable apprehension\nthat the Defendant may not be able to recover any sums including the\nadmitted sums.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_23\">9.       On the other hand, Mr. Akhil Sibal, learned Senior Counsel for the\nPlaintiff submits that the Bank Guarantee is independent of the main\ncontract between the parties. The invocation, according to learned Senior\nCounsel, is fraudulent, inasmuch as once the settlement had been arrived at,\nas captured in the minutes of meeting held on 25 th October, 2018, the\nPlaintiff had, in fact, given effect to the settlement and paid some moneys to\nthe Defendant. In light of this, the Bank Guarantee could not have been\ninvoked. It is further submitted that the present suit only relates to the Bank\nGuarantee, which does not have either a jurisdiction clause or an arbitration\nclause. Thus, the suit is maintainable before this Court as\n       The Bank Guarantee was issued by a branch office of Kotak\n         Mahindra Bank located in Delhi;\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_24\">       the Bank Guarantee has been invoked in Delhi, and\n       the invocation letter has been received in Delhi.\n      Thus, part of the cause of action arises in Delhi.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_25\">10.      Further, it is submitted that the invocation is not in terms of the Bank\nGuarantee as the exact amount due ought to have been specified in the\ninvocation letter. It is further submitted that the reason being given for\ninvoking the Bank Guarantee i.e., the kicking off of the moratorium period\nunder the IBC is also not valid as performance Bank Guarantees are\nexcluded from the scope of insolvency proceedings under Section 14 read\nwith Section 331(3) of the IBC. It is further submitted that this is a case\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_11\">CS (COMM) 1251/2018                                                    Page 5 of 16</span>\n which is covered by the settled precedents, which hold that an injunction\nrestraining release of payments under the Bank Guarantee can be granted if\nthe invocation is fraudulent. The disputes having been settled between the\nparties, and the mode of payment having been agreed, the invocation of the\nBank Guarantee four days after the e-mail dated 15th November, 2018 is not\njust fraudulent but also malafide and dishonest, according to the Plaintiff.\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_26\">11.

Though, there is no dispute to the proposition that a Bank Guarantee\nis independent of the main contract, the question as to whether the Bank\nGuarantee could or could not have been invoked, depends on the\ninterpretation of the underlying agreement itself. The invocation of the\nBank Guarantee is permissible, if the Defendant claims money to be due and\npayable by the Plaintiff. The question as to whether the money is due and\npayable cannot be decided without reference to the MOU and the\nAgreements entered into between the parties. In fact, the submission of the\nPlaintiffs, that the invocation is not in terms of the guarantee itself cuts both\nways i.e., the Court has to, therefore, examine as to whether the amount is\ndue and payable. This obviously requires the Court to examine the\nobligations of the parties under the agreement and go into the merits of the\ndisputes.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_43\">15.    Even the second submission on behalf of the Plaintiff, that the dispute\nhas been resolved in view of the e-mail dated 15th November, 2018, would\nalso require adjudication. Thus, for deciding as to whether the invocation is\nas per the Bank Guarantee issued under the contract, or whether the dispute\nhas been settled or not, the adjudication cannot be done without reference to\nthe underlying contract and the Agreements. The jurisdiction clause is clear\nto the effect that the Courts in Mumbai itself shall have &quot;exclusive\njurisdiction&quot; over `all disputes‟ between the parties.

It is settled law that cause of action consists of\n             bundle of facts which give cause to enforce the legal\n             injury for redress in a court of law. The cause of action\n             means, therefore, every fact, which if traversed, it\n             would be necessary for the plaintiff to prove in order to\n             support his right to a judgment of the court. In other\n             words, it is a bundle of facts, which taken with the law\n             applicable to them, gives the plaintiff a right to claim\n             relief against the defendant. It must include some act\n             done by the defendant since in the absence of such an\n             act no cause of action would possibly accrue or would\n             arise. In view of the admitted position that contract\n             was executed in Bombay, i.e., within the jurisdiction of\n             the High Court of Bombay, performance of the\n             contract was also to be done within the jurisdiction of\n             the Bombay High Court; merely because bank\n             guarantee was executed at Delhi and transmitted for\n             performance to Bombay, it does not constitute a cause\n             of action to give rise to the respondent to lay the suit\n             on the original side of the Delhi High Court. The\n             contention that the Division Bench was right in its\n             finding and that since the bank guarantee was executed\n             and liability was enforced from the bank at Delhi, the\n             Court got jurisdiction, cannot be sustained.&quot;\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"182571437\" id=\"span_28\">17.

The principle of law that a bank guarantee is an\n           independent contract between the issuing bank and the\n           beneficiary and has no concern with the main contract\n           between the beneficiary and the party at whose\n           instance the bank guarantee has been issued, with\n           reference to territorial jurisdiction of a Court, has to\n           be understood in the context of jurisdiction with\n           reference to the mother contract. The independence of\n           a contract for guarantee simply means that the dispute\n           concerning the bank guarantee has to be resolved in\n           terms of the bank guarantee i.e. the bank guarantee is\n           the complete contract between the bank issuing the\n           guarantee and the beneficiary. But since the bank\n           guarantee flows out of the mother contract the\n           jurisdictional issue has to be resolved in the context\n           of the cause of action arising under the contract for\n           the reason a guarantee is invocable, though in terms\n           of the guarantee, but in relation to the main contract.\n           To wit. Instant guarantee is a performance guarantee.\n           The performance of the contract by the plaintiff has to\n           be in terms of the contract. The bank guarantee simply\n           states that a demand by the beneficiary, alleging non-\n           performance, would require the bank to pay under the\n           bank guarantee.\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">           13. <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1549410\" id=\"span_30\">In the decision reported as (<a href=\"/doc/1549410/\" id=\"a_21\">1996)3 SCC 443 South\n           East Asia Shipping Co.

As held above,\n           issuance of the bank guarantee from Delhi is not a part\n           of the cause of action and territorial jurisdiction\n           cannot be determined with reference to the said fact.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_49\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160033184\" id=\"span_34\">18.    A perusal of the above observations clearly shows that the question of\nterritorial jurisdiction has to be decided with reference to the mother\ncontract, and not independently thereof. The Court has also observed that\nmere issuance of a Bank Guarantee from Delhi would not vest jurisdiction in\nthe Delhi High Court. In the said case since the exclusive jurisdiction was\nvested in Athens, the Court held that Delhi High Court had no jurisdiction.\nA similar view was also taken by another Learned Single Judge of this Court\nin <a href=\"/doc/160033184/\" id=\"a_24\">Alfa Therm</a> (supra) where it was observed as under:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">           &quot;13.      I find from the entirety of the facts in the\n           present case that the parties had agreed to the\n           exclusive jurisdiction of the Courts at Guwahati. The\n           terms of the invitation for bid were accepted by the\n           plaintiff by making a bid. It is not the plaintiff‟s case\n           that its bid was without agreeing to Clause No. 46\n           (supra). The defendant no.2 is the Government of\n           Assam. The invitation for bid was issued from\n           Guwahati for works to be performed in Guwahati and/\n           or in the State of Assam. In the circumstances, the\n           Clause 46 aforesaid is to be read as excluding the\n           jurisdiction of Courts at any other place even if\n           otherwise having jurisdiction. The jurisdiction of this\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_35\">CS (COMM) 1251/2018                                                    Page 13 of 16</span>\n            Court is ousted for this reason alone and need is not\n           felt to go into the question whether this Court would\n           have jurisdiction for the reason of the plaintiff as a\n           bidder having furnished the bank guarantee of a bank\n           within the jurisdiction of this Court even through\n           guaranteeing payment to defendant no.2 at Guwahati.\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_50\">           It does not stand to logic that in such circumstances the\n           place of bank issuing the guarantee would have\n           jurisdiction. The defendant no.2 while entertaining the\n           bids is not concerned with the address of the bank\n           issuing the guarantee is assured at the place of\n           residence of the defendant no.2 i.e. the guarantee is\n           assured at the place of residence of defendant no.2 i.e.\n           Guwahati. It would be unfair to hold that territorial\n           jurisdiction of places where the branch of the bank\n           issuing the guarantee is situated can be invoked qua\n           the disputes relating to the said guarantee. In the\n           present case, the plaintiff was free to arrange the bank\n           guarantee from a branch of the bank at any place and\n           the defendant no.2 cannot be made to run to that place\n           for contesting a suit. I also do not find any merit in the\n           plea of the invocation letter being issued to the\n           defendant no.1 bank at Delhi. The invocation letter\n           would naturally be addressed to the bank issuing the\n           bank guarantee. However, the core dispute is between\n           the plaintiff and defendant No.2. The relief of\n           injunction claimed is qua the defendant no.2 only. If\n           this Court does not have the territorial jurisdiction to\n           entertain the dispute qua the relief of declaration, the\n           question of entertaining the lis even if this Court were\n           to have jurisdiction qua the relief of injunction against\n           the defendant No.1 bank does not arise.&quot;\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_51\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"160033184\" id=\"span_36\">19.    The above judgements were sought to be distinguished, by the Ld.

The dispute in the present\ncase cannot be held to be outside the Memorandum of Agreement simply on\nthe ground that the Bank Guarantee is independent of the main contract. The\nquestion as to whether the amounts are due and payable are to be decided\nonly under the MOU as also the Agreements under which the Bank\nGuarantees have been issued. The submission that the invocation is not in\nterms of the Guarantee is also intertwined with the minutes of meeting dated\n28th October 2018, as contained in the email dated 15th November 2018. If\nthe disputes were in fact settled, could the invocation have been done in the\nfirst place, is an issue to be decided on the substantive obligations of the\nparties, under the agreements as also under the settlement, and not merely by\nreading the Bank Guarantee. The clause in the present contract is extremely\nclear i.e., that the Courts sitting in or having principal jurisdiction over\nMumbai, shall have &quot;exclusive jurisdiction of all disputes hereunder&quot;.
