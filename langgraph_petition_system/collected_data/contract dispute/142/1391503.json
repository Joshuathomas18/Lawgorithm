Substitution allowed.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_2\">     These  appeals,   by  special  leave,  arise  from\t the\njudgment of  the Madras High Court, dated December 20, 1990,\nmade i n O.S.A. Nos. 109 and 110 of 1988.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_3\">q    The admitted facts are that the respondents had entered\ninto an\t agreement with\t the appellant\tto construct  inter-\nconnecting tunnels  for Suruliyar  Hydroelectric Project  as\nper specification No. 1138- Schedule-B to the agreement. The\ninitial value  of the  tender to be awarded was Rs. 47 lakhs\nand it\twas revised  to Rs. 69 lakhs on January 16, 1975. In\nthe course  of execution  of the  contract, a  sum of Rs. 92\nlakhs was  paid to  the respondent.  The contract  was to be\ncompleted within  a period  of 24  months from\tthe date  of\ntaking over  of the  site, i.e.,  January 18, 1975; thus, it\nwas completed  after the  expiry of  the term, on August 25,\n1978. Resultantly,  there had  arisen a\t dispute as  to\t the\nentitlement to\tfurther amount\ttowards the work done by the\nrespondent.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_4\">     On a notice issued by the respondent for appointment of\nan  arbitrator\tin  terms  of  clause  50  of  the  contract\n(arbitrator clause),  there was\t a delay  on the part of the\nappellant  i  n\t nomination  of\t the  arbitrator.  When\t the\nrespondent exercised  the power,  after expiry\tof the\ttime\nprescribed in  the notice,  appointing\ta  sole\t arbitrator,\nproceedings under  <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_1\">Section 33</a>  of the  Arbitrator Act,\t1940\nwere initiated\tby the\tappellant.  One\t of  the  objections\nraised by  the appellant in the proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_2\">Section 33</a>\nwas that under the terms of the contract the claim sought to\nbe put\tup in  the notice  given by  the respondent  was not\narbitrable. The\t question was  gone    into  and  the  court\nrecorded a finding as under:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_1\">     &quot;If the petitioner had come forward\n     to\t raise\tdispute\t and  if  it  is\n     outside the scope of clause 50, the\n     first respondent  itself would come\n     forward with such a reservation. It\n     is not  as if  all\t disputes  would\n     come within  the cope  of clause 50\n     and  only\tthose  that  would  come\n     within the ambit of clause 50 alone\n     can be  decided by\t the Arbitrators\n     when such\tis the clear position on\n     this    aspect;\t enabling    the\n     petitioner\t  Board\t  to   raise   a\n     objection regarding  disputes which\n     may not  come within  the scope  of\n     clause 50\tis not a concession, but\n     a recognition  of a right, which is\n     available\t not\tonly   to    the\n     petitioner Board but also the first\n     respondent\t in  the  event\t of  the\n     Board  raising   any   dispute   as\n     against it.  Therefore,  the  first\n     stipulation is  dependent upon  the\n     Arbitrators deciding  as to whether\n     particular\t  dispute   would   come\n     within the\t scope of  Section 50 or\n     not, and only if they consider that\n     it\t falls\t within\t the   scope  of\n     Arbitration clause, they would have\n     the  jurisdiction\t to  decide  the\n     same.   In\t  the\tevent\tof   the\n     Arbitrators   holding    that   any\n     particular dispute\t is outside  the\n     Arbitration clause, it is not as if\n     the first respondent is deprived of\n     remedies by  agitating the\t same in\n     Course.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_5\">     It is also further held that :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_2\">     &quot;After the\t award is  made, as  the\n     petitioner\t  Board\t   has\t already\n     reserved its right, it would enable\n     the Board\tto raise  this point, in\n     the event\tof any\tneed arising for\n     setting aside the award in Court.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_6\">     Pursuant thereto, condoning the delay liberty was given\nto the\tappellant to  nominate an  Arbitrator on  its behalf\nwhich accordingly  was done  and  dispute  was\treferred  to\narbitration.  Arbitrability   of  some\tof  the\t claims\t was\ndisputed as  part of no liability. Since the two Arbitrators\ndiffered, an  umpire was  selected by the Arbitrators and he\nhad gone into the question. At this stage, it is relevant to\nmention that  some of  the claims  made by  the\t respondents\nrelate to  excavation of   hard\t rock in  the tunnel and the\nrate of claims.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_7\">     The relevant clauses of the Contract postulate thus :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_3\">     &quot;22.

The  umpire, without going into the details, in\na non-speaking award as against the claim of Rs. 2 crores 10\nlakhs, has  awarded a consolidated sum of Rs. 70.83 lakhs as\nunder :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_9\">     &quot;I\t  hereby  award\t and  direct  as\n     follows:\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_10\">     (1)  The Respondent  shall pay  the\n     claimant a\t sum of\t Rupees\t Seventy\n     Lakhs eighty  three thousand  seven\n     hundred and  ninety three only (Rs.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_11\">     70,83,793/-)   and\t   release   the\n     earnest  money   deposit  and  Bank\n     Guarantees\t  furnished    by    the\n     claimant  in   lieu   of\tSecurity\n     Deposit, in  full settlement of all\n     claims and counter-claims.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Facts\" id=\"p_11\">     Calling the award in question, an application to set it\naside has been filed. The respondent filed an application to\nmake the  award the  rule of  the  court.  The\tcivil  Court\ndismissed the  petition of  the appellant and made the award\nthe rule  of the court. On appeal, the Division Bench of the\nHigh Court  has confirmed  the same.  Thus these appeals, by\nspecial leave.\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_12\">     Shri  V.R.\t Reddy,\t the  learned  Additional  Solicitor\nGeneral, contends  that the  award is  illegal on account of\nomission on  the part of the Umpire to give the findings and\nreasons in  support thereof  of\t the  arbitrability  of\t the\nclaims.\t He  contends  that  arbitrability  of\tclaim  is  a\njurisdictional issue.  The arbitrator  cannot clothe himself\nwith  the   power,  in\ta  non-speaking\t award\tto  award  a\nconsolidated sum,  without deciding the arbitrability of the\nclaims set  up by  the respondents including those which are\nnot part of the contract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_13\">     Shri Poti,\t learned senior\t counsel for the respondents\nhas contended that the award being a non-speaking one in the\nabsence of  specific reference\tdirecting the Arbitrators to\ndecide the  arbitrability of some of the items in the claims\nset up\tby the\trespondent, Umpire  was not  called upon  or\nobliged to  decide  the\t dispute  by  a\t speaking  order  on\narbitrability. He  reached the conclusion whether or not the\ndispute or  the claim  is arbitrable and obviously he was of\nthe opinion  that all  the claims  are arbitrable  and he is\nempowered to  decide it either rightly or wrongly. He may be\nwrong in  not expressly giving his decision on arbitrability\nof some\t of the\t claims. However, his decision is within his\njurisdiction. He  is not required to give any reasons in the\naward for  reaching that  decision. When  the arbitrator had\ngiven a\t consolidated sum  towards all\tthe claims, it would\nmean that he had considered the arbitrability of some of the\nclaims in  terms of the contract and that, therefore, he has\nnot committed any error in reaching that conclusion which is\napparent on  the face  of the  record. In the absence of any\nspecific  reference  for  deciding  that  dispute,  even  if\nincidentally  he   reaches  that   decision,  he   gets\t the\njurisdiction and  power to  decide the question, he gets the\notherwise also,\t the award cannot be assailed o n the ground\nthat he\t reached a  wrong decision  without any\t reasons  in\nsupport thereof.  In that  event, it  must be deemed that he\nhad considered\tthe non-arbitrability of the items in a non-\nspeaking ward  given by him. He also further contends that i\nn the  absence of any agreement between the parties that the\narbitrator would  give reasons in support of his decision on\nthe arbitrability  of the  dispute, he is not called upon to\ndecide the  dispute by\ta speaking  award. What is required,\ntherefore, is  to be  considered is  whether the  arbitrator\nreached\t the  decision\tas  to\tthe  entitlement  to  for  a\nspecified sum  or disentitlement thereof, in his award. Once\nhe specifies the amount to which the respondent is entitled,\nit must\t be deemed  that he had taken into consideration the\narbitrability of all the claims including the claim relating\nto non- arbitrability of some of the items and had given the\naward. Thereby, consolidated sum in the award is not subject\nto attack  that the award made by the Arbitrator is vitiated\nby any error of jurisdiction or error of law apparent on the\nface of\t the record.  Shri Poti\t further contends  that\t the\ncontract of  arbitration is  not part  of the record and the\numpire had  not referred  to the  agreement as\tpart of\t the\naward and  that, therefore,  it is  not open to the court to\nlook into  the contract\t to find  out whether the contractor\nclaimed at  the rates  higher than  what were contracted and\nthe umpire has omitted to consider the non- arbitrability of\nthe claims  in respect\tof some\t of the\t items.\t <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1150387\" id=\"span_1\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"196949\" id=\"span_2\">In  support\nthereof, the  places strong reliance on the decision of this\nCourt in  <a href=\"/doc/196949/\" id=\"a_3\">Tarapore and\tCo. v.\tCochin Shipyard Ltd., Cochin</a>\n[(1984) 2  SCC 680],  in particular,  paragraphs  10,  12,33\nthereof, and <a href=\"/doc/1150387/\" id=\"a_4\">State of A.P. v. R.V. Rayanim</a> [(1990) 1 SCC 433\nat 435, para 5].</span></span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_14\">     In view  of the  respective contentions,  the  question\nthat arises  for consideration\tis: whether  the Umpire\t was\nrequired to give a decision supported by reasons on the non-\narbitrability of some of the items in terms of the contract.\nIt is  already seen  that the Court prior to the proceedings\nunder <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_5\">Section  33</a> had gone into the question as to the right\nof the\tappellant to  question the  arbitrability of some of\nthe items  and had expressly recorded, as seen hereinbefore,\nthat if\t any objection\tregarding  the\tdispute\t is  raised,\neither parties\tis at liberty to raise the same and avail of\ndecision by the arbitrator and the arbitrator is required to\ndecide the  arbitrability of  the claim\t and if he considers\nthat  it   falls  within   the\tscope\tof  the\t arbitration\nclause/arbitrability, then he would have the jurisdiction to\ndecide the  same. If  the decision  has been  reached by the\narbitrator against  the appellant,  it would  be open to the\nBoard to  raise that  point, in\t case any  need\t arises\t for\nsetting aside the said award in the court. Thus, it could be\nseen that  prior to  the proceedings  under <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_6\">Section  33</a>, the\ncourt had left open the umpire had to decide the dispute. In\nthe event  of the decision going against the Board, the same\nis also entitled to question the correctness of the award in\na court of law. That order has become final.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_15\">     In the  light of  the above facts, the question arises;\nwhether the  arbitrator was  not obliged  to decide the non-\narbitrability  of   some  of   the  items   claimed  by\t the\nrespondents before/while  giving a  non-speaking  award\t and\nwhether a  deemed  decision  could  be\tgiven  credence.  In\nTarapore Co.&#x27;s\tcase relied on by  Shri Poti, a Bench of two\njudges\tof   this  court  had  gone  into  the\tquestion  of\njurisdiction of\t the arbitrator\t to decide the arbitrability\nof the dispute. In para 10 thereof, it is stated thus :\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_12\">     &quot;What is  the effect  of  referring\n     the specific  question  of\t law  to\n     arbitration  without  prejudice  to\n     one&#x27;s  right   to\tcontend\t to  the\n     contrary\t will\t be    presently\n     examined.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_16\">     If this issue specifically raises a\n     question as to jurisdiction  of the\n     arbitrator to  arbitrate  upon  the\n     dispute set  out in  Point No.2, it\n     appears to\t have been  specifically\n     referred to  the arbitrator for his\n     decision.\t  Parties,    therefore,\n     agreed  to\t  submit  the\tspecific\n     question even  with regard\t to  the\n     scope   ambit    width   and    the\n     construction  of\tthe  arbitration\n     clause  so\t  as   to   define   its\n     parameters and contours with a view\n     to ascertaining  whether the  claim\n     advanced  by   the\t appellant   and\n     disputed by the respondent would be\n     covered by\t the arbitration clause.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_17\">     Whether upon  its true construction\n     the   arbitration\t  clause   would\n     include  within   its  compass  the\n     dispute  thus  raised  between  the\n     parties  was  specifically\t put  in\n     issue  because   parties  were   at\n     variance about it.&quot;\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_13\">     &quot;The arbitrator  was thus\trequired\n     and called\t upon  first  to  decide\n     whether the  dispute is  arbitrable\n     as falling\t within\t the  width  and\n     answer is\tin the affirmative, then\n     alone  the\t second\t point\tneed  be\n     examined.\tIf  the\t answer\t to  the\n     first point  of reference is in the\n     negative in  that if the arbitrator\n     were of he opinion that the dispute\n     is not  arbitrable as  it would not\n     fall within  the  scope,  width  an\n     ambit of the arbitration agreement,\n     it would  not be  necessary for him\n     to determine  whether the appellant\n     was entitled to recover anything by\n     way of compensation. This aspect is\n     being analysed  in depth  to  point\n     out that  the parties  specifically\n     referred\t the\t question     of\n     constriction     of     arbitration\n     agreement,\t its  width,  ambit  and\n     parameters\t vis-a-vis  the\t dispute\n     raised so\tas to decide whether the\n     dispute  would   fall  within   the\n     purview\tof    the    arbitration\n     agreement,\t in   other  words   the\n     jurisdiction of the arbitrator.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Issue\" id=\"p_18\">     Thus, it  could be\t seen that  therein  that  when\t the\nquestion is  specifically referred  to the  arbitrator,\t the\narbitrator is  required to  decide the\tquestion referred to\nhim and\t decide the point on the question. Then only he gets\nthe jurisdiction  to go\t into the  merits. In para 12 of the\njudgment that point was elaborated holding that :\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_19\">     &quot;The    first    point    extracted\n     hereinbefore  would   clearly  show\n     that the  specific\t question  about\n     the jurisdiction  of the arbitrator\n     to arbitrate  upon the  dispute set\n     out in  Point Nos.\t 2, 3  and 4 was\n     specifically   referred\tto   the\n     arbitrator.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_20\">     On the  first point, the arbitrator\n     had to  decide whether  the  claims\n     made by  the appellant and disputed\n     by the  respondent would be covered\n     by clause\t40, i.e. the arbitration\n     clause.   In   other   words,   the\n     specific question\treferred to  the\n     arbitrator\t   was\t   about     his\n     jurisdiction to  arbitrate upon the\n     disputes covered  by Points Nos. 2,\n     3 and  4, if  and only  if, upon  a\n     true    construction     of     the\n     arbitration clause\t that  is  first\n     paragraph of clause 40, would cover\n     the disputed claim for compensation\n     he can enter into the merits of the\n     dispute and decide it.&quot;\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_21\">     This ratio clearly establishes that the arbitrator gets\njurisdiction to decide the dispute on merits only when he is\nspecifically called  upon to  decide the dispute in terms of\nthe contract.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_22\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1863731\" id=\"span_3\">In <a href=\"/doc/1863731/\" id=\"a_7\">Managing  Director, J  &amp; K  Handicraft v.

In para\n5, this Court had held that:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_14\">     &quot;...

We  find it difficult to agree\n     with  this\t  submission   for   two\n     reasons: Firstly,\tthe award is not\n     a\t totally   non-speaking\t     one\n     inasmuch as  it gives  as resume of\n     the     incentive\tscheme\tand  the\n     agreement between\tthe  parties  as\n     also the items of the claim made by\n     the respondent.  Of  course,  while\n     fixing the\t amount found payable by\n     the  appellant,   no  reasons   are\n     recorded. Secondly, if there is any\n     challenge\tto   the  award\t on  the\n     ground that  the arbitrator  had no\n     jurisdiction to make the award with\n     regard   to   a   particular   item\n     inasmuch as it was beyond the scope\n     of reference,  the only way to test\n     the correctness of such a challenge\n     is to  look  into\tthe    agreement\n     itself.  In  our  opinion,\t looking\n     into the agreement for this limited\n     purpose is\t neither  tantamount  to\n     going into the evidence produced by\n     the parties  nor  into  the  reason\n     which weighted  with the arbitrator\n     in making the award.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_23\">     In fact  this Court had gone into merits while deciding\nthe question  as to  whether the arbitrator was justified in\nmaking\tthe   award  in\t excess\t of  the  jurisdiction\twith\nreference to  the arbitration  agreement  and  deciding\t the\ndispute on that basis.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_24\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"1267330\" id=\"span_4\">In <a href=\"/doc/1267330/\" id=\"a_8\">U.P.

But  in such  a case one\n     has to  determine\tthe  distinction\n     between an\t error in  excess of the\n     jurisdiction. Whether  a particular\n     amount was\t liable to  be\tpaid  or\n     damages liable to be sustained, was\n     a decision within the competency of\n     the arbitrator  in\t this  case.

An  arbitrator\n     cannot give himself jurisdiction by\n     a wrong  decision collateral to the\n     merits as\tto facts  on  which  the\n     limits of his jurisdiction depends.\n     Where it  was a condition precedent\n     to\t his   jurisdiction   that   the\n     dispute should have arisen during a\n     tenancy between  the plaintiff  and\n     the tenancy  between the  plaintiff\n     and the  defendant or  in the event\n     of a collusion if certain works had\n     been  completed,\tthe   arbitrator\n     could  not\t  clothe  himself   with\n     jurisdiction by  a wrong decision n\n     the preliminary point.

It  is for  the court\n     and  not\tfor  the  arbitrator  to\n     decide finally  whether or\t not the\n     arbitrator\t has   jurisdiction  and\n     that is  the law  both in India and\n     in England.&quot;\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_24\">     &quot;....The\tquestion   whether   the\n     matters referred  were  within  the\n     ambit of  the clause  for reference\n     of &quot;any difference or dispute which\n     may arise\tbetween the  partners is\n     for the court to decide&quot;.\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_25\">     &quot;....Dispute about the existence or\n     validity of  the contract and as to\n     the existence of facts which render\n     it\t  illegal must\tbe determined by\n     the   court    and\t  not\tby   the\n     arbitrator.

That\t would be  within his  jurisdiction. In such\njurisdictional issue,  even if\t an  error is committed that\nmay not\t be an\terror apparent\ton the\tface of\t the  record\nbecause the  arbitrator, the  chosen forum,  may  commit  an\nerror in  exercising his  jurisdiction. However, if he, by a\nspeaking award, decides it on a wrong proposition of law, it\nwill be\t an error  apparent on the face of record and liable\nto correction.\tIf the arbitrator decides a dispute which is\nbeyond the  scope of  his reference  or beyond\tthe  subject\nmatter of  the reference  or he makes the award disregarding\nthe terms of reference or the arbitration agreement or terms\nof the\tcontract, it  would jurisdictional  error beyond the\nscope of  reference, he\t cannot\t clothe\t himself  to  decide\nconclusively that  dispute as it is an error of jurisdiction\nwhich requires\tto be  ultimately decided by the court. This\nCourt has  pointed out\tthe distinction\t between latent\t and\npatent error of jurisdiction in <a href=\"/doc/196949/\" id=\"a_19\">Tarapore Co.</a>&#x27;s case thus:</span>\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_26\">     &quot;It has  to  be  seen  whether  the\n     terms of  the  agreement  permitted\n     entertainment  of\t the  claim   by\n     necessary implication.

Such a proposition will\n     mock  at  the  terms  agreed  upon.\n     Parties cannot be allowed to depart\n     from  what\t  they\thad  agreed.

When a specific reference has\nbeen made  to the  arbitrator  and  the\t parties  raise\t the\ndispute of  arbitrability, with\t the leave of the court/by a\ndirection of the court in a proceedings under <a href=\"/doc/1154891/\" id=\"a_20\">Section 33</a>, he\nis to  decide the  arbitrability of  the dispute  and make a\ndecision of  the arbitrability\tf the  dispute\tand  make  a\ndecision  while\t giving\t reasons  in  support  thereof.\t The\ndecision of the arbitrator in granting a particular sum by a\nnon-speaking award, therefore, hinges upon the arbitrability\nof a dispute arising under the contract or upon a particular\nitem claimed thereunder. He is required to give the decision\nthereon. The  question of  decision by\timplication does not\narise since  his jurisdiction to decide to dispute on merits\nhinges upon  his jurisdiction to decide the arbitrability of\nthe dispute.  In this  case, in view of the finding recorded\nby the\tcourt,\twhich  has  become  final,  as\treferred  to\nearlier, the  arbitrator/umpire was  enjoined to  decide the\narbitrabilty of\t the claims  set up  by the  respondent\t and\ndisputed by  the appellant.

It was held thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_27\">     &quot;The  trappings  of  a  body  which\n     discharges judicial functions and s\n     required to  act in accordance with\n     law    with    their    concomitant\n     obligations for reasoned decisions,\n     are  not  attracted  to  a\t private\n     adjudication  of\tthe  nature   of\n     arbitration as  the latter,  as  we\n     have  noticed   earlier,\tis   not\n     supposed  to   exert  the\t State&#x27;s\n     sovereign\t judicial   power.   But\n     arbitral  awards\tin  disputes  to\n     which    the    State    and    its\n     instrumentalities\t  are\t parties\n     affect  public   interest\tand  the\n     matter  of\t  the  manner  in  which\n     government\t\tand\t     its\n     instrumentalities\t  allow\t   their\n     interest to  be  affected\tby  such\n     arbitral\tadjudications\t involve\n     larger  questions\t of  policy  and\n     public interest.

R.V. Rayanim &amp; Ors.</a> [(1990)\n1 SCC  433], relied  on by  Shri Poti,\tthe  question  arose\nwhether the  award of  escalation charges  in a non-speaking\naward is  vitiated by  any error apparent on the face of the\nrecord? Therein the question of jurisdictional issue had not\narisen. On  the other hand, on merits, it was contended that\nthere was  an error  in that  behalf. In  para 5 it was held\nthat &quot;\tit was\tthen contended, that the award has purported\nto grant  damages on  the basis\t of escalation\tof cost\t and\nprices and  such escalation  was not  a\t matter\t within\t the\ndomain of  the bargain\tbetween the parties and having taken\nthat  factor   into  consideration   the  award\t  was  bad.&quot;\nTherefore, the\tratio there  is an  authority supporting the\ncontention on  the need\t of an arbitrator to give a reasoned\ndecision on  arbitrability  of\tthe  contract  or  claim  in\ndispute.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_40\">     In this  regard, <a href=\"/doc/193987/\" id=\"a_24\">Section  31(3)</a> of the  Arbitration and\nConciliation Act, 1996, provides thus:\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">     &quot;(3) The arbitral award shall state\n     the reasons upon which it is based,\n     unless-\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_30\">\t  (a)  the parties  have  agreed\n     that no reasons are to be given, or\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_31\">\t  (b)  the award  is an arbitral\n     award on agreed terms under Section\n</blockquote><blockquote id=\"blockquote_32\">     30.&quot;\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_41\">     The Parliament  has expressed the legislative judgement\nthat the  award shall  state reasons  upon which it is based\nunless parties have agreed otherwise or the award is covered\non agreed terms under <a href=\"/doc/1503578/\" id=\"a_25\">Section 30</a> of the new Act.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_42\">     Thus, the law on the award, as governed by the new Act,\nis other way about of the pre-existing law; it mandates that\nthe award  should state\t the reasons upon which it is based.\nIn other  words, unless\t (a) the parties have agreed that no\nreasons are  to be  given or  (b) the  award is\t an arbitral\naward on  agreed terms\tunder <a href=\"/doc/1503578/\" id=\"a_26\">Section 30</a> of the new Act, the\naward should  state the\t reasons in support of determination\nof the liability/non-liability. Thereby, legislature has not\naccepted  the\tratio  of  the\tConstitution  Bench  in\t the\nChokhamal Contractor&#x27;s\tcase that  the award,  being in\t the\nprivate law  field, need  not be a speaking award even where\nthe award  relates to  the contact  of\tprivate\t parties  or\nbetween\t person\t  and  the   Government\t or   public  sector\nundertakings. The principle is the same, namely the award is\ngoverned by <a href=\"/doc/1145875/\" id=\"a_27\">Section 31(3)</a>.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_43\">     We have  set out  the relevant  portions of  the award.\nFrom a\treading thereof, it is clear that the arbitrator had\nconsidered the\tclaims made  on the  basis of escalation and\ndamages, in  a non-speaking award of the disputes consisting\nof  arbitrable\tand  non-arbitrable  claims.  He  awarded  a\nlumpsum amount\tof  Rs.\t 70,83,793/-.  It  is  difficult  to\ndiscern as  to what  extent the\t umpire had  considered\t the\nadmissible and\tinadmissible claims  which he  adjudged.  In\nsuch a\tsituation, it  is not  possible to  discern to\twhat\nextent he  had exercised  his jurisdiction  vis-a-vis of the\nadmissible claims  and disallowed the non-arbitrable claims.\nSo, it\tis not\tclear whether  he  exercised  his  authority\neither beyond  his jurisdiction or in abdication thereof. In\neither case,  it is  an\t error\tof  jurisdiction,  the\tvery\nfoundation for his decision.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_44\">     It is  well settled  that in the matter of challenge to\nthe award  there are  two distinct  and\t different  grounds,\nviz., that  there is  an error\tapparent on  the face of the\nrecord\tand   that   the   arbitrator\thas   exceeded\t his\njurisdiction. In  the latter  case, the\t court can look into\nthe arbitration\t agreement but under the former it cannot do\nso unless  agreement but  under the  former it\tcannot do so\nunless the agreement was incorporated or cited in  the award\nor evidence  was made  part of the agreement. In the case of\njurisdictional error,  there is\t no embargo  on the power of\nthe court  to  admit  the  contract  into  evidence  and  to\nconsider  whether   or\tnot  the  umpire  had  exceeded\t the\njurisdiction because  the nature of the dispute is something\nwhich has  to be  determined, outside  the  award,  whatever\nmight be said about it in the award or by the arbitrator. In\nthe case  of non-speaking award, it is not open to the court\nto go  into the\t merits. Only  in a speaking award the court\ncan look  into the  reasoning in the award and correct wrong\nproposition of\tlaw or\terror of law. It is not open to\t the\ncourt to  probe the  mental process  of the  arbitrator\t and\nspeculate,  when   no  reasons\thave  been  given    by\t the\narbitrator, as\tto what impelled the arbitrator to arrive at\nhis conclusion.\t But in\t the  later  case  the\tcourt,\twith\nreference to the terms of the contract/arbitrator/umpire has\nexceeded his  jurisdiction in  awarding or refusing to award\nthe sum of money awarded or omitted a consolidated lumpsum.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_45\">     <span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"Pos\" data-docid=\"527224\" id=\"span_12\">In fact,  in <a href=\"/doc/527224/\" id=\"a_28\">G.S.\tAtwal &amp;\t Co.</a>&#x27;s case,  having noticed\nthat the  arbitrator had  exceeded his jurisdiction to grant\namount de  hors the  terms of  the contract and being a non-\nspeaking award, the court was unable to speculate as to what\nextent the  award was  within the  terms of  the contract or\nclaims made  and to  what extent  the amount  awarded was in\nrespect of non-arbitrable dispute. Accordingly, the order of\nthe civil  court was set aside reversing the judgment of the\nDivision Bench of the Calcutta High Court.</span>\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_46\">     Thus considered,  we hold\tthat the  arbitrator, having\nbeen  invested\t with  the   jurisdiction  to\tdecide\t the\narbitrability of  certain claims,  has\tcommitted  error  of\njurisdiction in\t not considering  the arbitrability  of\t the\nclaims and  passed a  non-speaking award,  awarding a sum of\nRs. 70.83  lakhs and odd. It is difficult to ascertain as to\nwhat extent he has awarded the claims within the contract or\nthe claims  outside the\t contract, of  a total\tclaim of Rs.\n2.10 crores.  Under those  circumstances, we are constrained\nto hold that it is difficult to give acceptance to the award\nmade by\t the umpire  as upheld by the courts below. Equally,\nwe find\t it difficult to accept the contention that out of a\nclaim of  Rs. 2.10  crores, only  a sum of Rs. 70.83 and odd\nwas awarded.  So, it  is not  a fit case for interference on\nthe basis  of the  mere fact  that a  lesser  sum  than\t was\nclaimed has  been awarded. An illegal award cannot be upheld\nto be valid or within jurisdiction.\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_47\">     The question then is : what procedure should be adopted\nin this\t behalf? The  contention of Shri Poti is that it may\nbe remitted  to the  umpire for\t fresh consideration. On the\nother hand, the contention of Shri V.R. Reddy is that in the\nevent of the conclusion that the arbitrator has exceeded his\njurisdiction, the  entire award\t would become invalid and it\nhas to\tbe set\tat naught. Having given due consideration to\nthe respective\tcontentions, we find force in the contention\nof Mr.\tV.R. Reddy.  Mr. Poti  has stated  that though it is\nfound that  the award  is not valid in law, the party cannot\nbe made\t to suffer on account of the illegality committed by\nthe umpire.  We find  no force\tin the\tcontention.  Once  a\nfinding recorded  that the  umpire/arbitrator has  committed\nerror of  jurisdiction, as  stated earlier,  two course\t are\nopen, viz.,  either to\tremit the  award to  the umpire\t for\nreconsideration or  to set aside the award in toto. We think\nthat the latter course would be appropriate in the facts and\ncircumstances in this case.\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_48\">     Accordingly, we  allow the\t appeals set aside the award\nof the\tarbitrator and\tleave the  parties to bear their own\ncosts. If there are no outstanding dues recoverable from the\nrespondents, the  security deposit  and\t bank  guarantee  is\nrequired to be refunded to the respondent.\n</p>\n\n\n","numcites":13,"numcitedby":60,"docsource":"Supreme Court of India","citetid":1391503,"divtype":"judgments","relatedqs":[{"value":"arbitrator jurisdiction","formInput":"arbitrator%20jurisdiction"},{"value":"jurisdictional error","formInput":"jurisdictional%20error"},{"value":"errors OF jurisdiction","formInput":"errors%20OF%20jurisdiction"},{"value":"award should be reasoned  ","formInput":"award%20should%20be%20reasoned%20%20"},{"value":"what is exceeding jurisdiction","formInput":"what%20is%20exceeding%20jurisdiction"},{"value":"arbitral award","formInput":"arbitral%20award"},{"value":"arbitration clause","formInput":"arbitration%20clause"},{"value":"error of law","formInput":"error%20of%20law"},{"value":"speaking award ","formInput":"speaking%20award%20"},{"value":" award by arbitrator","formInput":"%20award%20by%20arbitrator"},{"value":"escalation","formInput":"escalation"},{"value":"reference to arbitrator","formInput":"reference%20to%20arbitrator"},{"value":"contract claims","formInput":"contract%20claims"},{"value":"Arbitrability","formInput":"Arbitrability"},{"value":"tarapore","formInput":"tarapore"},{"value":"arbitration agreement","formInput":"arbitration%20agreement"},{"value":"apparent error on the face of it","formInput":"apparent%20error%20on%20the%20face%20of%20it"},{"value":"Terms of the contract","formInput":"Terms%20of%20the%20contract"},{"value":"question as to the jurisdiction ","formInput":"question%20as%20to%20the%20jurisdiction%20"},{"value":"\"arbitration agreement\"","formInput":"%22arbitration%20agreement%22"}],"cats":[{"value":"arbitration-agreement","formInput":"tag:arbitration-agreement"},{"value":"set-aside-award","formInput":"tag:set-aside-award"}],"courtcopy":true,"query_alert":null,"agreement":false}
