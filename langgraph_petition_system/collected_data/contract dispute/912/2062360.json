They were awarded with a contract by the\n\n                respondent for construction of the Desalination Plant [LSTK2] out of LSTK- 1 to 3.\n\n                Originally tender was invited for a period of one year. The claimant submitted its\n\n                offer on 06.04.2009 and the price quoted was Rs.1.07 Crore per month.

Hence, it is his contention that\n\n                operation of the plant includes producing quality water. Even if the plant was to run\n\n                more than 650 hours and the quantity is in variance with the guaranteed parameters,\n\n                those hours would not be considered for the purpose of operation of the desalination\n\n                plant. Hence, it is his contention that if the hours in which the desalination plant was\n\n                running while deficient producing water, it has to be construed as the desalination\n\n                plant in operation and it would be unreasonable and contrary to the express terms of\n\n                the contract and above view of the arbitrator is not even possible. Hence, it his\n\n                contention that if such an interpretation is given, the contractor would be in a\n\n                position to pass sewerage water and supply the same to <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_4\">CPC</a>L as product water for\n\n                a period in excess of 650 hours per month and <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_5\">CPC</a>L would still be required to pay\n\n                the entire consideration of Rs.65,00,000/- to the claimant.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_32\">                          10. It is the further contention that as per the contract, the hours of the\n\n                operation of the plant not producing the quality water will be treated as lost hours.\n\n                Therefore, it is their contention that the liquidated damages are levied with effect\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_8\">                Page 9 / 36</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                       Original Petition Nos.492 &amp; 544 of 2020\n\n                from February 2012 to October 2012 due to the product water being deficient.\n\n                Hence, proportionate liquidated damages has been levied.        Therefore, the learned\n\n                arbitrator having held that the defective water is not attributable to <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_6\">CPC</a>L and found\n\n                that the IEIL has established that it has incurred a sum of Rs.1,25,00,000/- loss per\n\n                month on account of the shortfall in the quality or quantity of water. However, the\n\n                arbitrator has erroneously rejected the contention of the respondent that even if the\n\n                claimant operated the desalination plant for a period of 650 hours per month with\n\n                inferior quality product water, liquidated damages could be levied.                    Such\n\n                interpretation is contrary to the express terms of the contract. It is also submitted\n\n                that the learned arbitrator has also failed to construe the terms of the contract\n\n                holistically and harmoniously and rejected liquidated damages in so far as quality\n\n                parameters are concerned and awarding a sum of Rs.74,66,540/- in favour of the\n\n                claimant is vitiated by patent illegality and such a finding has to be set aside. The\n\n                express terms of the contract are clear to mean operation would mean quality\n\n                operation, nevertheless, the words subject to and notwithstanding ought to have\n\n                been implied in clauses 66.3.1 and 66.2 and Contract as it would be reasonable and\n\n                equitable, necessary to give business efficacy, it goes without saying, capable of\n\n                clear expression and it does not contradict any express terms of the contract.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_9\">                Page 10 / 36</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                          Original Petition Nos.492 &amp; 544 of 2020\n\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"RespArg\" id=\"p_33\">                          11. It is the further contention of the learned counsel for the petitioner that\n\n                the learned arbitrator awarding interest from the date of the statement of claim is\n\n                erroneous. As far a disallowing claim No.5, it is submitted that the arbitrator has in\n\n                fact has factually recorded a finding that no production was done due to the strike\n\n                by the workmen during installation and commissioning of the desalination plant by\n\n                the claimant. The above claim was made as a strike by workmen as force majeure\n\n                event. Now, before this Court, the contention of the claimant is that it does not\n\n                come under the force majeure clause and the same is contrary to their pleadings and\n\n                submissions before the learned arbitrator. At any event, the learned arbitrator has\n\n                considered the entire aspects and rejected the claim. Therefore, claiming such an\n\n                amount by the claimant is not maintainable in the eye of law. With regard to the\n\n                claim No.7, the learned arbitrator has factually deducted the damages for quantity\n\n                and quality of water for particular months. The above findings is based on the\n\n                factual findings of the learned arbitrator and the same cannot be interfered. Hence,\n\n                it is his contention that the awarding pendentilie interest is also not as per law and\n\n                against the contractual terms. In support of his submissions, he has relied upon the\n\n                following judgments :\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Section\" id=\"p_34\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_10\">                Page 11 / 36</span>\n\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_28\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"106738077\" id=\"span_11\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"10332596\" id=\"span_12\"><span class=\"citetext\" data-sentiment=\"PARTY\" data-docid=\"95111828\" id=\"span_13\">https://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                      Original Petition Nos.492 &amp; 544 of 2020\n\n\n                                  Associate builders Vs.

Clause 66.2 states that\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_14\">                Page 12 / 36</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                            Original Petition Nos.492 &amp; 544 of 2020\n\n                no penalty shall be levied if the plant is in operation for a minimum period of 650\n\n                hours and produces more than 2,00,000 metric ton per month. As per 66.3, if the\n\n                plant for reasons attributable to the contractor does not operate for a minimum\n\n                period of 650 hours per month, but produces more than 2,00,000 metric ton, penalty\n\n                shall be limited to 15% of the monthly payable lump sum amount. It is his further\n\n                contention that there is no deviation of operation in the contract. Change in the\n\n                deviation suggested by the claimant was not accepted by the respondent is not\n\n                acceptable.           Hence, it is his contention that the operation must be taken into\n\n                consideration to interpret the contract. The learned arbitrator has taken note of the\n\n                above facts and interpreted the contract reasonably. Hence, it is his contention that\n\n                the construction of the terms of contract, it is for the arbitrator to decide. The\n\n                Courts cannot interfere unless the arbitrator has considered the contract beyond the\n\n                terms of the contract. Hence, it is his contention that the tribunal has applied clause\n\n                66.2 to the facts and upheld quality penalty for one month and quantity penalty for\n\n                another month. Therefore, it cannot be said that there is no application of mind.\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"PetArg\" id=\"p_36\">                          13.       It is the further of the learned Senior Counsel that as far as the\n\n                pendentilite interest is concerned, clause 9.35 does not prohibit interest on disputed\n\n                claims.           Clause 9 deals with pre arbitration interest and pre arbitration claim.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_15\">                Page 13 / 36</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                           Original Petition Nos.492 &amp; 544 of 2020\n\n                Whereas the Special Conditions of the Contract in Clause 45 deals with interest and\n\n                states that Interest, if awarded by the arbitrator, shall be at a rate not exceeding the\n\n                cash credit prevailing on the date of the award. Hence, it is his contention that the\n\n                clause 45 of Special Conditions of the contract empowers the arbitrator to award\n\n                interest. The arbitral Tribunal interpreted clause 45 and clause 9.3.5 harmoniously\n\n                and held that clause 9.3.5 prohibits the awarding of pre-arbitration interest and\n\n                clause 45 permits pendentelite interest.         Hence, the reasoning of the learned\n\n                arbitrator is possible and reasonable and therefore, it cannot be set aside.\n\n\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_37\">                          14. It is his further contention that as far as O.P.No.544 of 2020 filed against\n\n                the dismissal of the claim against July 2012 is concerned, it is his contention that the\n\n                learned arbitrator having found that the plant was not in operation for a minimum\n\n                period of 650 hours for the reasons not attributable to the contractor and the\n\n                arbitrator ought to have released liquidated damages to the petitioner in O.P.No.544\n\n                of 2020. Similarly, dismissal of the claim for January 2011 is also contrary to the\n\n                penalty clause 66.3. The arbitral tribunal on finding that the plant had produced\n\n                51,525 in January 2011 as required under clause 66.3 ought not have refunded the\n\n                penalty. Further, the tribunal has not taken note of the above facts.

It is the further contention of the learned Senior Counsel that the arbitral\n\n                tribunal dismissed the claim No.9 on the ground that since the labourers created\n\n                problem and went on strike, the same lead to shut down of the plant and this\n\n                amounts to force majeure events and therefore, the arbitrator has held that the\n\n                contractor is relieved of payments. It is his contention that the interpretation of the\n\n                arbitrator is not reasonable and plausible and will not fall under Clause 7.8.1.\n\n                Clause 7.4 deals with the extension of time or relieve the contractor of his full\n\n                obligation under the contract. Clause 7.4.6 not restricted to extension of time alone.\n\n                It covers time for completion of all the obligations in the contract including monthly\n\n                production of water. The learned arbitral tribunal interpreted clause 7.8 in isolation\n\n                from clause 7.4.6 and held that even if the events constitute force majeure, IEIL will\n\n                not be relieved from the responsibility under clause 7.4.6. Therefore, penalty clause\n\n                66.1 will apply and <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_10\">CPC</a>L cannot withheld the entire amount. Hence, it is his\n\n                contention that the arbitral tribunal ought to have granted all his claims.

The learned arbitrator considering the various grounds raised by the\n\n                claimant, held that liquidated damages cannot be enforced in claim No.5 and 7 and\n\n                discussed various reasons attributable to claimant and negatived the claim. Though\n\n                the word has been used as penalty under clause 66, it is only a pre-determined\n\n                liquidated damages. The learned arbitrator in para 15 concluded that the in the\n\n                contract in question there is no lump sum amount fixed as even maximum amount\n\n                fixed cannot be treated as something in terrorem. It is not lumpsum, but the same is\n\n                proportionate to loss and so it has to be treated as pre determined liquidated\n\n                damages.          Hence, the arbitrator has concluded factually that the word penalty\n\n                mentioned in clause has to be treated only as liquidated damages. The various\n\n                factors pleaded by the claimant for violating the contractual obligation is also\n\n                discussed in para 17 to 27 by the learned arbitrator in his award.

The\n\n                learned arbitrator has infact, held that under 66.2, the conditions are complied with,\n\n                no      penalty shall be levied.   Under 66.3 the respondent can levy penalty as\n\n                stipulated under the said clauses and rejected the contention <a href=\"/doc/161831507/\" id=\"a_15\">of CPC</a>L that mere\n\n                operation of the plant for more that 650 hours without production of quality water\n\n                cannot be a ground to deny the liquidated damages. Such submissions has not been\n\n                accepted and the arbitrator has given reason for the above that the clause is not\n\n                subject to the other clauses and held that each clause is independent and is not\n\n                subject to other clauses and held that levy of liquidated damages for the month of\n\n                February 2012 and June 2012 and October 2012 is not correct, except for the month\n\n                of July 2012. The learned arbitrator has also given a reason for levying liquidated\n\n                damages for the month of October 2012 in para 34 of the award. Similarly in para\n\n                7, it is held that clause 66 quantity of water should be as stipulated in the contract\n\n                and having held that except for the month of January 2011, he has granted relief to\n\n                the claimant.

It is to be noted that <a href=\"/doc/1052228/\" id=\"a_29\">Arbitration Act, 1940</a> wherein interest is\n\n                envisaged under 3 stages pre reference, pendentelite and post award. Whereas,\n\n                Arbitration and Conciliation Act 1996, particularly <a href=\"/doc/772406/\" id=\"a_30\">Section 37</a> [7] [a] and (b) of the\n\n                Act, contemplates interest payable on two stages, i.e., from the date of cause of\n\n                action until the award and post award. Therefore, the learned arbitrator awarding\n\n                interest for the pre-reference stage including to pendentilite interest is contrary to\n\n                the very contractual terms and provisions of the <a href=\"/doc/1306164/\" id=\"a_31\">Arbitration and Conciliation Act</a>.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_41\">                Page 32 / 36</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                          Original Petition Nos.492 &amp; 544 of 2020\n\n\n                The Apex Court in Sayeed Ahmed and Company V. State of Utta Pradesh and\n\n                others reported in [2009] 12 SCC 26 in para 16, has held as follows :\n\n</p><blockquote id=\"blockquote_59\">                                  “In view of clause [a] of sub-section [7] of <a href=\"/doc/1769118/\" id=\"a_32\">Section 31</a> of the\n\n                           Act, it is clear that the arbitrator could not have awarded interest\n\n                           upto the date of the award, as the agreement between the parties\n\n                           barred payment of interest. The bar against award of interest would\n\n                           operate not only during the pre-reference period, that is, up to\n\n                           13.03.1997 but also during the pendentilite lite period, that is from\n\n                           14.03.1997 to 31.07.2001.”\n\n\n\n</blockquote><p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_59\">                          30. Clause 45 of the Special Conditions of the Contract does not specify the\n\n                payment of pendentilite interest. It only envisages rate of interest in the event of\n\n                interest is awarded by the arbitrator. Therefore, merely because the rate of interest\n\n                is suggested in Special Conditions of the Contract, it cannot be said that such clause\n\n                permit the arbitrator to award pendentilite interest. Therefore, this Court is of the\n\n                view that when the terms of the contract particularly bars interest,                awarding\n\n                pendentilite interest by the arbitrator is nothing but perverse. Accordingly, granting\n\n                interest from 01.08.2015 till the date of the award, i.e., 23.04.2018 is set aside.\n\n\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_42\">                Page 33 / 36</span>\n\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n\f                                                                         Original Petition Nos.492 &amp; 544 of 2020\n\n                However, the post interest at the rate of 15% Ordered by the arbitrator is confirmed\n\n                and the rest of the award is also confirmed including post award interest.\n\n                Accordingly, this Court do not find none of the grounds under <a href=\"/doc/536284/\" id=\"a_33\">section 34</a> of the\n\n                Arbitration and Conciliation Act to interfere the award other than the interest\n\n                portion in O.P.No.492 of 2020.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_60\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Conclusion\" id=\"p_61\">                          31.
