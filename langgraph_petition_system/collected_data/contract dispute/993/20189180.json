However, the Honourable Supreme Court went on to clarify\n\n                     that the aforesaid rule was not a &#x27;rigid&#x27; or inflexible one. It also observed that\n\n                     in personam subordinate rights flowing from rights in rem were clearly\n\n                     arbitrable;\n</blockquote>\n<blockquote id=\"blockquote_29\">                                  b) Ouster based on forum exercising exclusive jurisdiction –\n\n                     Disputes arising out of a special statute, which are reserved for the exclusive\n\n                     jurisdiction of special courts are generally considered to be non arbitrable.\n</blockquote>\n<p data-structure=\"CDiscource\" id=\"p_41\">                     Until 2020, the issue of arbitrability of Intellectual Property disputes was\n\n                     always contested based on the aforesaid tests.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_42\">\n\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_43\">                                  22.

In\n\n                     fact, the Hon’ble Supreme Court, in Booz Allen, itself provided an instance\n\n                     to support this distinction, i.e., while rights under a patent licence may be\n\n                     arbitrated, the validity of the underlying patent are not. Thus, instead of a\n\n                     blanket ban on the arbitration of IP disputes, it became crucial for the courts\n\n                     and tribunals to have a case-by-case analysis of the actual issue involved to\n\n                     adjudicate on the arbitrability of IP disputes.\n</p>\n<p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_44\">\n<span class=\"hidden_text\" id=\"span_17\">                     17/31</span>\n\nhttps://www.mhc.tn.gov.in/judis\n</p><p data-structure=\"Precedent\" id=\"p_45\">\f                                  23.

The\n\n                     respondents / defendants have also not filed any application under <a href=\"/doc/1146817/\" id=\"a_24\">Section 8</a>\n\n                     of the Arbitration and Conciliation Act, seeking for reference of the dispute\n\n                     to arbitration even assuming there exists an arbitration clause in the contract\n\n                     entered into between the applicants / plaintiffs and the respondents /\n\n                     defendants.
